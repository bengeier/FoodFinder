{"text":"Had a five course group dinner with 20 people service and food was excellent.  The wait staff kept the tables in water, fresh drinks and plenty of food for over 3 hours with no misses.  Lobster bisque and romaine salad excellent, ribs very tender and fries crisp.  No complaints from the entire group."}
{"text":"Service was lousy food was ok the lobster bisque was the best thing on the menu so i ordered a drink of Southern Comfort and ginger ale my drink of choice But they don't serve that type of whiskey so I ordered a Jameson and ginger ale it was ok but the drink was $7.50 I didn't want gold I only wanted a drink ,"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic pub food, the cocktails are great and the service is outstanding. It's a great night out."}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:15PM and told we had a 30 minute wait for a table. An hour and 22 minutes later we still don't have a table.   Sitting at bar to get food with an 8PM show at the Oaks Theatre. Hostess was no help when asked about the situation.  Would not recommend. Get your act together."}
{"text":"The food I had was exquisite. The people around me felt the urge to compliment their dishes as well. Other people I know that have visited give high remarks on the food. VERY DELICIOUS MENU! My favorite thing about this place, of course, is the alcohol selection. With a very decent craft beer selection and one hell of an Old Fashioned cocktail, I will definitely be making multiple trips here in the future."}
{"text":"I feel guilty giving it 2/5 stars, but it's truthful. I am the target demographic for Pub 333; young DINKS, moved to Oakmont within the last few years. Plus we love farm to table and trendy food, so we EXPECTED to love Pub 333.  The portions are small. This is acceptable, IF the food is very tasty and well seasoned.   Pork belly was boring. Serenity Hills is the local pastured pork that's the most tasty; it's where Cure and most chef-driven restaurants source their pork. This pork tasted like it was purchased at the day old section of Giant Eagle.  Salad's dressings were again, unflavorful. The service was pretty bad, even for a gastropub standards.  I've heard the drinks are tasty, but it appears to have died down in newness. I don't hear of many people returning.   The space is cool and full of potential. I want to like it. I'll return if the menu is revamped."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal along with the atmosphere! I recommend the Lobster Bisque, Caesar Salad, Black & Bleu Shrimp, Lobster Roll, and huge Italian Meatballs!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but just ok. I was expecting a lot better for the price! The service is always just ok, as well. The staff has always been polite, but no one is ever actually friendly or appears to be happy to be there. Who knows - maybe that is just my impression. I've had prompt service the few times that I've been there, but I've always been less then impressed with the overall experience. It's worth a try but it will never be in my regular rotation."}
{"text":"I work in the same building as Pub 333 and go here sometimes for lunch.  Their food is hit or miss.  I have had a few things that I did not expect to be spicy that were very spicy and I like spicy things.  Also, sometimes their lobster bisque is fantastic this past time it was very runny.  The atmosphere is nice and the outdoor seating is nice in the summer as well.  They do not offer lunch specials and their pricing are a bit steep.  The people who own Carnivore's down the street own this place too."}
{"text":"I like this addition to Oakmont ...give them a chance to workout growing pains - the food is worth it!  You Oakmonters are some damn tough critics. I think this place is a nice addition to the scene in the business district.  I have liked everything I've tried there & service has been fine. I think they are working out service kinks.   Food is welcome difference from the joints down the street (cough Monaco cough)  Decor is awesome!"}
{"text":"Started with drinks, White Russians my favorite.    Had the lobster bisque  Yummy with lots of lobster.   Finished with grilled pub sprouts.   They were very filling.   Tasty with bacon like meat.   Very nice.   Had 8 in our group, waited 5 or 10 minutes, quick service, sat us right away, waiter was great.    Would highly recommend and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a nice Atmosphere !! So relaxing . Our drinks were delicious however it took so long to actually get them. Our waitress seemed like she got lost every time she left the table , it took her so long to come back when we asked for anything including our bill. I barely touched my sandwich and she didn't even ask me if I liked it or not. Also we were there during lunch and it was not busy at all!!"}
{"text":"The service was great, the food not so much. The pizza had big blobs of ricotta cheese mixture that was overpowering. The pizza doe was undercooked, and there was way too much raw garlic. The fries were good but had a lot of sauce on it too."}
{"text":"Always good food and good drinks. It's my family's favorite spot to go in Oakmont. There is also an insanely good brunch menu!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, decent food, very nice atmosphere. The crab cakes were great. However, my dad had the oysters and said they weren't fresh. The mushroom crostini was delicious. Food took a while to come out but that's not a problem for me. It's a nice place and I would go again."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at a premium price. The brunch was ok but dinner was not. I've eaten dinner there three times and every time I was unimpressed. Not in a big hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for late lunch. Food and service was great. We had the grilled cheese, pub burger, and Cuban."}
{"text":"A local and regular despite the often pretentious staff and small portions VS competition in the area. Oakmont was lacking a place like this. Get all your staff on board to be knowledgeable and attentive, I would increase the rating."}
{"text":"First, the service was pretty bad.  We had to ask for water refills multiple times and our server was just not very attentive.  My daughter ordered a pizza and still didn't have it 10 minutes after the rest of us got food.  They did end up given us the pizza for free but by that time the rest of us were done and it was only after I went and got the supervisor at the front hostess stand.    The food wasn't very good either, my wife like her cuban but the burgers were not great and they came with smashed potatoes that were loaded with garlic.  I like garlic but these were horrible. When my daughter's pizza came it was also loaded with way too much garlic to the point that is all you could taste.  We also ordered the candy bacon and half of it came out burned and charred.  Poor service and generally bad food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very enjoyable and great service! The food was excellent! We enjoyed the Baked Oysters, Charred Brocollini, Black and Bleu Shrimp, Wedge Salad, and Whole Wings. Every single menu item we ordered was outstanding! There is very nice outdoor seating and the windows open from the inside to have a nice breeze. The pub is perfect for enjoying drinks and food at the bar or a delicious lunch or dinner! Definately recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was packed when we arrived last evening at 7pm. Had to wait 15 minutes before a hostess approached us even though no one else was in line. Once seated it took 20 more minutes before a waitress came to the table. Now nearly 8pm and lot of people leaving. Out order took 25 minutes to arrive. Although food was fair there is no way it was forth the wait. We left at 9pm promising never to be back."}
{"text":"Not a bad brunch spot, had a friendly atmosphere with lackluster service. The drinks were good. I had a lobster roll. It was more lobster than roll which was fantastic, however the dressing was very thin and runny; It was also served only top of a very large, very useless piece of lettuce. I ended up eating my sandwich with a fork. More bread please. My plate lacked balance and thought. Overall, great flavors and atmosphere, good brunch menu, average drinks."}
{"text":"Was in town for a concert, right next door. It was busy for a Thursday night. I got a beer &  a margherita pizza. Beer selection is limited. Although, I really enjoyed the pizza. Not sure if I would be back, because, not gonna head out of my way for this place. This is the first time ever in Oakmont."}
{"text":"For now, I have to give Pub at 333 this rating exactly - A-OK.  We stopped in shortly after they opened over the Fourth of July weekend.  They have good food, but it's not amazing and the prices are a little bit steep.  We have other places in Oakmont we prefer to eat, but I would definitely give this place another shot in the future.    We started with soups - Bobby got mushroom and I got their lobster bisque.  His was just OK.  Mine was delicious.  Very, very good bisque.  I ordered one of their salads and asked to add chicken to it. Bobby got their lobster roll.  My salad was very good, however, the chicken seemed processed to me. I probably would not order a chicken dish again for that reason.  Also, I thought it was weird that out of 6-7 salads they offer on their menu, not one of them had protein on it nor does it state the option to add a protein.   Bobby got their lobster roll and while it was tasty, it was an extremely small portion for $14.  This past Sunday, we stopped in for a drink during the fourth quarter of the Steeler game.  There were only a few other clusters of people throughout the restaurant - two parties of 4-6 eating dinner and three parties sitting around the bar watching the game.  There was a polite hostess and the bartender took good care of us.  They had a nice selection of seasonal beers.  I love the atmosphere in this place. It's dark and industrial while still being chic and cozy.  I love the floors and the tables and the d√©cor.  I will say, however, that both times I have walked in to Pub at 333, I don't get a very welcoming feeling.  Workers are always polite, but not the most friendly.  That could just be my opinion, though."}
{"text":"This is a great spot! The atmosphere is very cool. It is a modern style pub with outdoor seating. Service was fabulous. I had the pub burger with the red pepper slaw. They were both very delicious. My son had the grilled cheese with bacon and fresh cut fries. The sandwich was huge and he loved it. I definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"After attending Oakmont's \"Hometown Christmas\" event, we needed a place to warm up after standing in the cold for a few hours. Luckily, on the recommendation of a friend and local, we chose to check out Pub 333, and were very happy that we did!  The ambiance is fun and upbeat, and a bit more upscale than the general sports bar found in small towns. The bar is to the right of the entrance and surrounded on all sides by seating. The main space is full of booths as well as open tables, and TVs are scattered throughout the bar and dining area. The pizza oven is behind the bar, and patrons can watch as pizza is stretched and crafted. We sat in a booth, and though it did get a bit loud, we were still able to carry on a conversation without too much trouble.   We started our meal with some delicious red wine, and our friend had a hand-crafted Old Fashioned, which was much better than I expected. Upon seeing who the bartender was, I immediately knew why - we always had a favorite bartender at Meat and Potatoes, and lo and behold, he was now working the bar at Pub 333!  He recognized us as well, and made us a second drink of amaro and espresso liquor and finished off with a cherry. It was sublime, and something I never thought I would taste outside of the Pittsburgh city limits. The fact that they had amaro on hand shows how much faith they have in Jason, the bartender, and his ability to create outstanding drinks. This guy could make drinks at Bar Marco (which I still think is the best cocktail bar in the area). We cannot wait to return and sit at the bar, and have him mix us up some specialty cocktails.   Now, on to the food! I absolutely love wings, so I had to give the Crispy Whole Wings a try. They came out piping hot and especially crispy- we could not figure out how they got the skin so crispy but kept the meat juicy. I also shared roasted root vegetables, which were tasty but a bit soggy (maybe more roasting was needed?), and some fries, which were fresh but not remarkable. My husband had a broccoli rabe and sausage pizza, and it was a large portion for the price (enough for two meals). He said that the crust was chewy and had a good flavor, but needed more char to be perfect for his tastes. The sauce was not as flavorful. Our friend ate the grilled cheese and tomato soup, which he had eaten there before and enjoyed. Our waitress, Jillian, was on top of things throughout the night, and visited frequently to check on us. We do have a recommendation to purchase larger water glasses, since the small ones provided emptied quickly and our waitress was always on the hunt for the water pitcher.   Overall, it was a great Saturday night out, with good food and amazing drinks. As noted previously, we can't wait to go back and taste more drinks, and try other menu items!"}
{"text":"My mother and I have been frequenting this location since it opened.  We are constantly impressed with the exceptional service, the freshness of the food, and the comforting atmosphere.  There is yet to be a item on the menu that hasn't been outstanding !!  Thank you!! A+++ Lobster Bisque.  And the cheese sandwich is the most unique and flavorful of its kind!"}
{"text":"We had a late dinner here. Was recommended by my niece. Enjoyed the ribs cole slaw was the vinegar variety... very nice sauce on ribs nice sweetness and tang. Also a margarita pizza very simple well done!  Friendly quick service. Would recommend for pub food! Atmosphere modern, clean. Had small group playing not to loud could have conversation...nice"}
{"text":"Drink was good, but told us wait was 45 minutes. 90 minutes later still no table and found out our names had been crossed off. Would not find us another table. Terrible organization at hotess station."}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience here! My boyfriend and I are visiting with my mom from Atlanta. With the weather being so nice, the big front patio window was open. There were menu options for all of us and we were so pleased with the food. The happy hour is quite a bargain and I can't say enough good things about the service!   I had the kale salad which was delicious, my mom had the spinach salad and she was in shock with the flavor. My boyfriend had the full wing and he was hesitant to order it but he finished every one with no meat left on the bone! He also had the pepper slaw (and he hates cole slaw) and he had to have every last bite!"}
{"text":"Really good menu, good atmosphere...but food was average and service the same. New place that will be good, but need to work on quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Aaaaamazing food!!!! Roasted Brussels sprouts with fried leeks and bacon, what culinary genius came up with this? And that sauce...out of this world! Great drinks too. Love it here. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I am giving 3 stars because my friend enjoyed her lunch quite a bit. She had a very large portobello and prosciutto sandwich on ciabatta bread. I on the other hand ordered a lobster roll. I have never seen a sandwich or especially a lobster roll that small. It looked like those kids lunchables!!!! It was a small top split hot dog bun with a few tablespoons of lobster salad that was mooshed up like tuna salad. Not a single lobster chunk. Not worth $14.00 for a tiny sandwich and sliced cucumber salad. We had a good laugh though. They do not have a dessert. We left and went to Oakmont Bakery for a cupcake. I may try again but I will order something else, they are new. Dudes, the lobster is a joke, take it off the menu!"}
{"text":"Fantastic menu, generous portions, quality wine on tap , an open-fresh atmosphere and great service. Only downside was the beer selection was too standard. Some great local breweries in Pgh with vast selections... not sure why great food places are pairing more with them."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my new favorite places! Went for brunch today and the food was delicious! I had the fried egg and avocado sandwich. The candies bacon is also amazing. I love that their brunch goes until 2pm. I was also there for dinner and drinks last weekend and had a great experience as well! I had a pizza that they had on special and a strawberry basil Moscow mule. The strawberry basil mules are amazing! The service has been very good both times!"}
{"text":"I really didn't expect it to be like this when I walked in, but I couldn't find a single thing to complain about. I can be a bit hard on Oakmont sometimes and really wasn't prepared to give 5 stars, but here I am! I sat at a nice bar table. The waiter was fast and friendly. The menu was honestly the perfect size and had many vegetarian friendly options. The food seemed well thought out and the prices reflected that. I ordered the Margherita pizza and an order of fries with the gorgonzola cheese sauce. It came out in a good time and was really delightful! Thin Roman-style pizza with a truly excellent sauce. Perfect size to split between two people. The plates, salt and pepper shakers, dishes and water glasses all were carefully thought out and had their own creative flair to them. It felt classy! They make their pizzas in a woodfire brick oven, so this place means business. Not just a regular small town bar. Nothing but praise for these folks. Will return!"}
{"text":"So happened on this place since another restaurant I love was closed. First of all it took a while for a server to seat us. Then once we were seated we got our drinks promptly and scrolled over the menu.  Menu had a nice selection so I went with the lobster roll with roasted root vegetables and my Dinner partner got the lobster bisque and pulled pork nachos. After a while we noticed the people who came in after us were getting their soups and nothing came to our table. We flagged down the waitress and she thought we already got it when we obviously did. She brought it out right away.  Then the rest of our food come out right after. Everything was pretty good except my lobster roll was basically lobster with small cut up pieces of celery ect... was thrown on a huge not appetizing piece of lettuce which I took off. The root vegetables were good except a few pieces were under cooked. I have to say the nachos were the best thing about the meal. We're fresh made and delicious. They do have an open kitchen so you see them prep the food.  I think this place is way understaffed for the volume of people they serve. I would try this place again but now it know what to expect. Be interested to see how the pizza is."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and terrific bar staff. No reason to go anywhere else in Oakmont"}
{"text":"Service was great, food not so much. Are napkins were wet, dirty plates, dirty tables,burger tasted like it was from Wendy's. The crab cakes were just okay. Cool atmosphere, not impressed with their food."}
{"text":"I am not cheap and do not mind paying for a decent meal ... but $28 for two beers a bowl of Saturday's lobster bisque on Wednesday and an ice cream desert is a bit over the top ... especially when 80% of my second beer was discarded while I went to the men's room ... and I got to listen to the barmaid complain about how hard the owners are to work for when I could not get her attention for the second beer that I assume  she quickly threw away  The beer is cheaper at PNC Park ... and the people there are happy to sell it to you ... I should have gone to the game ... they at least would have let me finish my beer ... much better food and atmosphere within  blocks in Oakmont ... skip this place"}
{"text":"We stopped by here completely by accident. This place is wonderful!  We had the lobster bisque, meatballs and a sprout and balsamic pizza.  Oh and don't forget to try a mule!  Deliciousness!  Do NOT  listen to the bad comments?.  This place is a must.  We live a hour away and will be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time to visit for dinner.  Outdoor dining was very tight space, so no room for a guest to sit behind you.  Wait staff was not very attentive, a serious pet peeve; that's why I'm eating out- to be waited on.  We were done with dinner before our drinks were refilled.  The food is so-so in taste especially for the price.  Unusual menu items which is refreshing but needs help.  Lobster Bisque was served luke warm and basic in flavor.  The Panzanella salad was very good but too large of a serving even for 2 people; that is a side dish not a meal.  The crab cakes are very small, no taste, not enough aioli sauce on plate and pricey for nothing else on the plate. We will probably give it another try in a few months since this is a fairly new restaurant."}
{"text":"Always had a good meal here! I've also come in for drinks and apps which were delicious! I look forward to catching brunch one Sunday soon."}
{"text":"We've had good experiences here but it seems like management is not paying enough attention.  Several times, including tonight, we have arrived and been told there are no tables for two available. So we sit at the bar and pay attention to the empty tables for four that stay empty the entire time we are there until after we leave.  Maybe they are reserved?  Then the hostess staff needs to be better at timing the seating of tables.  The food is quite good but not consistently.  I've had the caprese panini in the past and liked it.  The balsamic drizzle is delicious and the arugula works well.  Tonight I ordered it and there was very little cheese in it, at best two very small pieces of it (across 4 large triangles of panini).  There needed to be almost as much mozzarella as tomato.  This place has a lot of potential and I would even say it's good.  For Oakmont it is very good.  It could be great if management was paying closer attention to details."}
{"text":"We were excited to try a new place in Oakmont and stopped in for lunch one day. The pizza we had was really good (had sausage and broccoli rabe) and the Cubano sandwich was also good though a little small for the price. The smashed potatoes were pretty sad though, not seared at all and just greasy and underseasoned. Will probably try again."}
{"text":"*Update: My wife had convinced me to give this place another try being as it's been several months since it has opened and I'm glad I decided to listen to her. We went there for Sunday Brunch and not only was the service much better this time around but the breakfast food was really good. Plus it was surprisingly inexpensive. I haven't been back here for dinner but their Sunday Brunch has definitely changed my mind about this place. Planning on going back for dinner soon.  Would give this negative stars if I could. Initially I was happy to see a nice new restaurant come to town so close to where we live. Unfortunately I was VERY displeased with this place. For starters when we walked in we were seated right away which was nice, however it took our server 20 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I know this because I kept track of the time while we were waiting. By this time the table behind us which sat down 10 minutes after us already had their drinks and order in. Finally 15 minutes later our server finally shows up with our drinks after I approached her about it. The food was ok at best and very overpriced. There was absolutely NO kids menu so it's definitely not a family friendly place. Asked for a side salad with my meal and they could only offer me an $11 Caesar Salad. There are much better restaurants in the area so I would advise saving your money or go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had brunch here with my girlfriends recently and everything was delicious! IMake sure you have a reservation for dinner on weekends as it gets busy and there will be a long wait"}
{"text":"Went to Pubb 333 for the first time to meet with friends. The service was the worst I have had in a long time. This establishment needs a  staff that is customer friendly, especially at the prices they charge. When staff was informed that restrooms needed \"tp\" we were told \"if you  don't like it go down the road \" So I  will!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars only because my husband enjoyed his food. The service was excellent and the place is nice and clean. However I hated he food. The menu needs to explain the dishes a bit more and the food is way overpriced for the serving sizes. I ordered he lobster roll with the the cucumber salad. Well the lobster was just over a cup of lobster meat on toasted white bread. The seasoning was subpar hello do they know salt is a seasoning 101. Same with the cucumber salad no salt and the onions weren't sliced well, I love red onion but not giant thick chunks. Someone needs to work on their knife skills. My biggest pet peeve is the no substitutions on the menu! REALLY!!! I worked as a Sous Chef years ago and that is just bad business especially with sub a limited menu. This place is trying to be a hipster hangout if just comes off as overpriced mediocre food. I won't go back or recommend. I had one of my husband's wings and they were just ok. Ribs were tender but the sauce tasted like it came from a bottle. I might try again if someone else is paying."}
{"text":"The Pub is one is the few decent restaurants in the Oakmont area, but the problem is that it isn't a steady, reliable option.  Sometimes the food is great, sometimes the food (despite a repeat order) seems to be severely lacking.   On a good day, I recommend the Pub Sprouts, the Black and Blue Shrimp, and the stuffed peppers."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the place and the food. Our server was very attentive at first, but when we needed check and box the server was very slow to get us out of there. I wouldn't have minded so much if we didn't have someplace we needed to be.  I recommend the pub sprouts. The wings were OK, lightly breaded and seasoned. My husband liked the brisket tacos. We will go back, but not when we need to get out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"1st time there...Great food! Decided to stop in on a whim for lunch. Menu looks awesome. We had the Pub Fries as an app. Loved the fresh cut fries. It just makes a difference in flavor when you use fresh, quality ingredients. I had the stuffed peppers, sauce was delicious! My bf had the meatballs. We both loved everything. Would defiantly recommend for anyone! If we didn't have homemade pizza @ home we might have tried the pies."}
{"text":"We came here for my wife's coworker's 50th birthday party.  It is in a small plaza in Oakmont.  There is parking but there wasn't a lot of space.  We had to pull out of the parking lot and find street parking near by.  It was Saturday night and it was packed.       We walked in and they were extremely busy.  We found where our party was and was directed where to go.  Unfortunately, there were no seats for us at that time so we just found some seats at the bar until we figured out what was going on.  They had an area of the restaurant for the party but we couldn't tell which was which.  I don't think this restaurant is the best for parties like this or a private party.  They did set up a small buffet table for party guest only.  Since we were at the bar I went to get some food and I brought it back to the bar.  I guess workers didn't know I was withthe party so they said something but the hostess knew that we were guest and she told them that it was ok that I got food.  Kind of awkward.         The bartender was nice although I didn't really care for the selection of beer.  They didn't have too much beer on tap.  They have cocktails on tap though if you like that.  My wife ordered a Manhattan which she enjoyed.       We sampled their nachos and pizza.  It was better than average and I would eat it again. The food on their regular menu looked decent too.  When the restaurant died down we could relax a little more and it's nice restaurant in Oakmont.  You can watch a sporting event good here and the atmosphere is good too.  Just was disappointed with the lack of beer selection."}
{"text":"A Hidden gem in Oakmont  Great food with eclectic menu Never had a bad meal there  Atmosphere is relaxed and unpretentious   Always great service and great beer list"}
{"text":"Saw bad reviews but tried anyway.   I would never give bad review for new place working out their bugs.  Been there twice now - have had good service both times.  I had Pig Pizza (awesome), white pizza and burger (also good).  Worth trying!"}
{"text":"Man, I really want to love this place...and I've been there multiple times now (including once for takeout) thinking it's going to get better, buuuuut it was time to throw in the towel and write a review. Perhaps I just haven't chosen wisely, but for me their food is average and a bit overpriced for what you get. Then again, it's usually jam packed on the weekends, so it's nice to see it still thriving. Of all the menu items I've tried, the grilled cheese & bacon edges out the stuffed peppers and even the classic Cubano - the side of vinegar-based bell pepper slaw is also a winner. And the fall vegetable beef soup is flavorful despite the lack of...well, beef. My dinner companion enjoyed her mozz & prosciutto sandwich yet the roasted root vegetables were so-so. It seems that's the best we can do from a rather uninspiring menu. The d√©cor is easy on the eyes, but falls into that all too common blueprint of vintage chic with a splash of modernity. We've stuck to the bar for our meals and service has been satisfactory. Nevertheless, I won't be returning anytime soon...maybe to check out a seasonal pasta/pie/stack in late summer when you can dine alfresco."}
{"text":"J and I came here for lunch today. Brunch is until 2pm and unfortunately we missed it by 10 minutes. When we got here, there were not too many people seated which was nice because service was extra fast! The decor is modern and very clean, with large tv screens around the restaurant. J ordered a coke with the marinara pizza and I had a lemonade and pesto and chicken pizza. Everything was pretty tasty and we had enough pizza to take home which was a bonus. We decided to split the cinnamon sugar dusted fried dough which comes with a cream cheese mouse and berries (blue and black) and J ordered a coffee. The fried dough was pretty good and we got a lot! That's one thing about this place, the food portions are pretty good. All in all, a nice experience. We most likely will be returning for the brunch, as we heard it was excellent."}
