{"text":"I got my first full dinner from Simmie's today and I must say it was DELICIOUS! I took my friend there for her first time and she LOVES it! Walking into that place and smelling all the different foods it was like I wanted everything. Even the stuff I don't eat I wanted just because it smelled and look good. The customer service was great! The owner let us sample what we wanted before settling on what we wanted to buy. I highly recommend this restaurant if you want some good soul food. The mac & cheese is top of the line. Haha!"}
{"text":"Ordered the whiting fish dinner and it was a much better portion than my last visit. I think I ordered the sandwich portion previously.  I got my money's worth and the fish was good. The sides were just ok the cornbread was also delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome store.. When you walk in and stare straight you see fridges of 40s, beer and cold alcoholic beverages like in the corner stores. Then you look left are frozen fresh fish for sell, as well as frozen Jamaican beef/ chicken patties. You look right, there's a variety of different hot plates, like rice and gravy, BBQ wings, cabbage.

All the folks that work there are friendly and love to joke around. Good atmosphere. I've had their BBQ wings, bomb, I mean hollla good, just the right spice, large in size. Potatoes dish and cabbage was good. You can buy a box of 40 something frozen patties to go, apparently they are the only distributors to all em Jamaican/ Caribbean joints around town.

Should go get lunch or dinner to go. They let you taste samples of their hot food too. Never been in the restaurant portion though."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Pittsburgh, for the past 9 years, I go to Simmies!!!!!! I love their Orange Roughy Fish sandwich and Cod fish sandwich. The shrimp are great too! I wish it were a bigger establishment...."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Simmie's in years, definitely not since they began renovations. I was pleasantly surprised - good portions, good prices, good food, good service. It's currently being marketed as a takeout restaurant, I called ahead and my order was ready in the time given. The person who took my order accommodated a change (swapped out 2 wings for a breast) to the standard menu with no issue. The macaroni & cheese was awesome, the chicken wings were good - although, I would have preferred a bit more seasoning - and the candied yams were okay. I will definitely be back; Simmie's satisfied my craving for soul food close to home!"}
