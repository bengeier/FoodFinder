{"text":"I went with three (3) other friends, for a total of 4.  I had the coq au vin, which was tough and dry.  Not that good.  What really ticked my off is that the waiter added a surcharge for a tip to our bill at 20%.  For a group of 4?!?"}
{"text":"The most bizzare dining experience of my life. It looked from the outside like a cheap place, almost a diner, so me and my brother went half from curiosity as to what a dumpy looking French restaurant was doing in Cave Creek and were surprised inside by a very fancy, very nice atmosphere and insanely expensive food. It was a Friday night and we were literally the only ones there. I asked the guy if he had anything to recommend, he just said everything is good. The waitresses were really great, kind, pretty, professional high school/college girls. Strangely they were a Hispanic family and I don't think they spoke much French, I'm not even sure the guy spoke much English. We ordered only simple and cheap relative to the $70 entrees, but it was really nothing special...I could have cooked that for half the price easy and I can't cook. But the relatively cheaper salad was amazing.

An extremely mysterious place."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate twice at Le Sans Souci, going for the Early Bird dinner, just $19.50 for three courses. The first night my husband had an excellent soupe a l'oignin (really French, without heaps of cheese) followed by trout, perfectly cooked. I had vichyssoise and then two pieces of true Dover sole a la meunière. Superb. Dessert was very good, too, but outshone by the dessert we had the second night, a soufflé Grand Marnier (ordered ahead, and brought to the table on a cart by our two fine servers, Max and Maria). The second night I had coq au vin--very good--and my husband had tenderloin brochettes, which was an amazing dish. We recommend eating at one of the little tables in the bar area. We enjoyed this more than the main dining room, which had less character. Also, I should mention that ordering the soufflé meant an additional charge of 18.50, which we didn't expect, but didn't question as we were so happy with the whole evening. Great, very well-priced wine, too, especially if you order a bottle."}
{"text":"i agree with maryanne...i have no idea where the people giving this dump 4 and 5 stars are eating, or possibly they work there!  i hae lived in cave creek for over a decade and this place has great ambiance inside, but the food is $$$$ and i could have made it better.  i understand louie at one time this place was great, but you need to retire and get an updated chef in your kitchen!  it is 
ashame to see this restaurant go away but that is what is happening due to the poor caliber of food!"}
{"text":"Very Disappointed.  We made reservation for a party of 4 on a tues. night.  We arrived and stood in the lobby/bar area for 10min.  No employee to be seen, my husband walked back into the kitchen to see a young male employee sitting on the line having a conversation with another employee.  We were sat at a table w/ stained table cloth, and 2 broken chairs that we exchanged out from another table.  We than opened up dirty menus with prices being on the high side, due to lack of A/C and poor conditions of the restaurant we got up and left.  The young staff did not seem to be bothered at all.  This restaurant seems to get good reviews,  but the 4 of us local residents will not return."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked roast beef dinners with potatoes and other legumes along with wonderful French onion and clam chowder soups for $25. Bread excellent as well. Ask for the sauce to come on the side for your roast beef as some may not want it on their meat. You cannot beat this deal for price portion or quality. Service awesome. I have eaten my way thru France and was brought up eating this kind of food. I recommend this charming little place!"}
{"text":"We had been here a few years ago and enjoyed the food and service. Something has obviously changed, as they were both quite bad this past Valentine's Day. The Caesar was not made at table and was limp and overdressed. The oysters were served with cocktail sauce and not mignonette or even a lemon wedge. The entrees were bland- each of the four our party reached for the salt immediately. Not a good sign! The waitstaff were terribly clumsy with the geridon, slamming into our chairs and blocking one of our party from his seat when he returned from the restroom. The menus are held together with scotch tape and the decor is reminiscent of someone's rec room. The music was on a short forty five minute loop. We were not offered coffee even though we had ordered soufflés with dinner. We had to flag a server down and ended up asking twice for our simple two coffee order. It's painfully obvious that no one has trained the staff. 
What may have once boasted fine French service and cuisine is now an incredibly overpriced, mediocre, sad and old restaurant. I can't possibly recommend this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience, especially considering the expectations we had based on others' reviews.  The prices are out of line with the quality of the food & service.  We had two specialités du chef:  the veal oscar and the caneton bigorade.  The veal was overly breaded, dry and tasteless.  The duck was good but not great.  The bread provided in the basket was low-quality supermarket grade \"French\" bread.  The server left a used knife from the salad course for us to re-use with the main course.  OK for a fast-food establishment, but not for a restaurant with pretensions of being something better.  The wine list is misleading: it took several requests to find a wine that they actually had, rather than simply listed in print."}
{"text":"We dined here for my hubbys birthday last night and it was wonderful!

We had some friends from out of town with a baby and a kid, and yelp info said not good for kids, but we really wanted to try it, so I called ahead and ask, the very nice gentlemen said no problem bring kids and babies along, it's a family restaurant, they even have kids menu, your kids may enjoy a nice dinner with you.

Yes, the server plays host as well, but it was a quiet Wednesday night and it didn't bother us at all. The food took a while to get to our table, but they are coking your food WHEN you order it, good food takes time, i say plan for at least couple of hours when you are here, to us the company was so nice we didn't even noticed the wait, get a nice glass (or bottle) of wine and enjoy the company...

The decor is somewhat dated, but it adds charm to the place, made me feel like I was visiting my aunt's house for a special occasion. 

to start we ordered the Caesar salad and it was prepared at our table I had a little taste and it was very good, but I had to have the onion soup (Soupe A L'oignon Gratinee) it was perfect, not too salty with some color, not black,  the cheese perfectly melted and not overpowering the onion.

For the main course we shared the Filet Mignon for two ordered medium and that is what we got, melt in your mouth good, it came with a delicious tomato stuffed with a mushroom cap, scalloped potatos were creamy but not cheesy and best of all was a Béarnaise Sauce it completed the meal perfectly.

Our friends got Sole De Dover Belle Meuniere, with the spines taken out by our table he absolutely loved it and she got the Petit Poulet best chicken she's ever had.
And for the grand finale we had ordered the Grand Marnier souffle when we started (thanks to the yelp reviews) absolutely worth the wait...

The chef was with us for a few minutes and told us the place was rented for about a year to somebody who made changes people didnt like and Louis got it back. So if you are doubtful to try this place because of the reviews, go ahead and give it a try, it;s worth it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently visited this little gem in celebration of our anniversary following suggestions for special occasion restaurants from another Yelper.  We took a chance as there were some mixed reviews and not a lot of commentary (a no-go in my husband's book).

We were pleased we did.  A bit of an adventure just in getting there, this quiet, out-of-the way place presented us with delightful treats.  We had the place entirely to ourselves - it was a Tuesday - and thus the complete and full attention of Chef Louis and our waiter.  While the decor is absolutely out of date and not at all \"in the moment\"  the history and nostalgia of the place were alluring and memorable.  They lit the fire for us and left us to enjoy each other's company.

Others have gushed about the amazing Caesar salad which we tried and enjoyed but perhaps more for the experience of it being made table-side than for taste or value.  Over $20 for a salad is a bit much.

Our main courses were excellent.  Hubs ordered the scallops cooked well but not perfect and I had beef tenderloin with mushrooms, which in my opinion, turned out to be the better choice.  The sides were nutritious with just a hint of flair.

Sadly, expecting my third child I was unable to sample the wine, though our creme brulee was DE-lish and they also graced us with a complimentary, candle-lit Napoleon in honor of our special day.  Very tasty and seemed very French.

A lovely experience for the patient and adventurous.  Would have been even better with music, but happily used our discount coupon via Yelp!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food was excellent, the atmosphere quaint (kinda like finding a mom and pop place in Europe) and the service was amazing!! And yes, as many have mentioned, the soufflé was amazing!! The owner/chef came out and greeted us and ended up spending some time telling us the story of the place! Been open 21 yrs! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Maryanne IS right. Same experience here. Lukewarm thinned out onion soup with Kraft Parmesan cheese!! French onion soup should be served with fresh grated Gruyere cheese slightly browned and melted. We asked for a Rose wine and he had only a Zinfandel: Beringer, the cheapest wine possible. This for a a 4 or 5 star rated restaurant? 
The server/busboy, all in one was not an asset to the restaurant. Fellow diners had the veal and the sole and we're happy with it. I was ok with my brook trout. The potatoes were very good. 
The place and the menu need updates. 
It was a disappointment overall. We live close by and wanted to find a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Le Sans Souci, in French translates to \"Without Care\" and boy oh boy was it true tonight. They didn't care about a thing other than getting back to the bar where they read their paper. The food was poor at best, everything was pre-frozen or a poor Sysco foods substitute. My filet had zero flavor except for the frozen chunk of Maitre'd butter. The Neapolitan I had for dessert must have been sitting the fridge for two days totally uncovered. It was hard as a rock, the powdered sugar fell off of it when it was handed to me and it fell off in a sheet because it was so dried out. And to boot, dinner for two with one glass of wine each cost me $100 plus. Not worth your time or your money - just skip this one.   And BTW, my wife just added, aren't you suppose to at least drain the water out of the salad bowl before you put dressing on it? Guess she's not going back either."}
{"text":"I live in LA and was a guest at this restaurant by someone who lives in the community.  The food is superb and the filet mignon was done perfectly.  The dessert, champagne, and the French flair to everything are memorable indeed.  This was actually my second visit this year and I'm looking forward to a few more next year as well.  In addition, the Owner stopped by to welcome our group each visit.  Great place to dine!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. French cuisine in our own backyard. Table-side prep for many entrees & desserts is great fun!"}
{"text":"Delicious crab stuffed mushrooms with vegetables and gluten-free soufflé! Wow. Don't forget to call ahead because you'll need reservations. Wonderful service too - last min accommodation, great recommendations, friendly demeanors and a free desert for checking in."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant, especially the lovely and courteous young ladies who were our servers. The smiles never left their faces from the time we arrived until the time we left two hours later. They were so accommodating, so eager to please, without ever being intrusive. I could not have felt more welcomed which is so rare in so many restaurants where servers can sometimes make you feel as though you are an inconvenience .

Now about the decor and ambiance. Though largely outdated, the decor is a bit country French and was probably quite attractive when it was first done. Now it looks a little tired. But the ambiance is nice with soft music in the background, which allows for easy conversation.

My husband and I both thought that the food was excellent. I had the frog legs which were delicious. My husband had the duck and cleaned his plate. For dessert we had the Grand Marnier soufflé and OMG! It was out of this world delicious and the best ever. We have had soufflés in France as well as in some of the top French restaurants in the country and the soufflé at Le San Souci tops them all!

The menu prices range from moderate to slightly higher but you get what you pay for and the quality of the food is worth the price. We are looking forward to our next meal there. Give it a try and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great Birthday meal we had. Ceasar salad made table side - really great - scallops & filet of sole - wonderful. Such a great variety. I hear they are having a July 4th Cave Creek Fireworks celebration Buffet and they have the best views for the Fireworks show. Very Special place. Thanks for the Birthday cheesecake."}
{"text":"Osters  Rockefeller over the top.  Orange ruffy was great.  Cheesecake home made was fantastic.  Best restaurant in carefree cave creek.  Staff super and funny. Great experience"}
{"text":"We decided to try someplace new based on previous reviews. There was only one other table being served in the entire place along with us. That made the atmosphere very awkward. Decorated like I was in my grandparent's basement from the 70's. Not really sure why this would be french cuisine. We were served little thin slices of toast with butter to start. Pate was very gamey and served with garnished tomatoes. Very, very strange. My french onion soup was served and then I was asked if I wanted cheese shredded over it, as an afterthought. Not very french. We actually laughed because the soup de jour was minestrone, which would never be found on a french menu. Ordered the champagne chicken which was definitely not fresh chicken breast. The server was nice and attended our needs but we would definitely not call this a french restaurant, especially since my husband was trained at French Culinary and we frequent Parisian restraurants. Won't be coming back-no matter what type of cuisine."}
{"text":"Great, Great Classic French Food!!! The service was great and it was a nice quiet atomsphere! When we first pulled in we were not sure what to expect but once we were inside we vowed that everytime we come back to scottsdale this resturant will be on our must to go list."}
{"text":"Since moving to AZ, I have actively been trying to hunt down a really good traditional French restaurant somewhere in the valley.  I was hoping this place would be the answer, but I found myself disappointed again.  We started with the escargot appetizer, which was decent.  Not outstanding, but probably slightly better than average.  For my entree, I ordered the Seafood Newburg.  While it was not outright disgusting, it wasn't even close to being on par with some other French restaurants I have dined at.  Dessert wasn't bad, but certainly not noteworthy.  I had a chocolate covered pistachio cake.  In regards to the atmosphere, I found it to be a bit run down and shabby.  Not at all like the romantic classic bistro feel like many other French restaurants I have been to.  In my opinion, it was just okay.  My overwhelming feeling as I left was that it was fine and edible, but I have had much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town with so much charm and history. Today for lunch I had the filet of sole which was light and refreshing on this hotter day. My lunch date had the lamb chops, which were perfectly grilled and seasoned. This is my 15th year coming here, so some of my favorites that are a must have are, Cesar salad, spinach salad, escargot, French onion soup, souffle and homemade cheesecake."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I visited this restaurant a few weeks ago. I was a little worried, as the place was completely empty at 7:00pm on a Friday night. We were greeted by two sweet servers and the chef himself. While one server was obviously new and inexperienced with the menu, the other was right there to guide her through. 
The chef came to our table and introduced himself and we talked for a few minutes .
We ordered from the back page of the menu where you can get a soup, salad, entree and dessert for under $50 per person. I also ordered the escargot, which was the best I have ever had in my life. As was my filet mignon. Perfectly cooked. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious,  perfectly prepared with great attention to detail. The onion soup was very good - despite what others have said in their reviews. We ordered the chocolate truffle dessert which was LARGE and exquisite! 
The service was great, the food was perfect, my vodka drink was actually too strong for me! Fresh flowers on every table and a charming atmosphere. Would I recommend this place?  Absolutely!  We are going back in 2 weeks, and we hope to see you there."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place with my family and always had a tasty meal even though it felt like I was eating in my grand mothers house. The decor is pretty useless but the food made up for that. The petit filet was always done perfectly and the bernaise sauce was a great addition. I liked the french onion soup and my family said it was the best Ceasar salad they have had. I don't eat salad but I know they are experts on the ceasar. It seems that the old waiting staff has left and the new staff leaves something to be desired. You can always catch louie wandering around keeping an eye on the place. Be careful not to sit too close to the bathroom lol!"}
{"text":"The food was ok and the service was great, until it was time to pay. I paid the tab with a Restaurant.com certificate along with cash. When they brought my change, the certificate had strangely disappeared and no credit was given towards the tab. No one would acknowledge the missing certificate and all of a sudden, no one spoke English. I told the waitress that once you find the certificate, you'll have your $25 tip. As we were driving out of the parking lot, we could see them validating the certificate by phone, at the front desk. How stupid do they think people are?  Crooks!  I had been waiting to go here for years, but I will never return."}
{"text":"Wow, great wine and French food 4 course price fixe dinner last night. Great service, appropriate pacing, hot plates (one of my most frequent complaints elsewhere) and high quality food. Both of us were very impressed: quiet and refined dining with tablecloths just as you would imagine fine French dining. Dover sole = A+ and beef filet also = A+. Lovely cold vichyssoise to start, well done simple salad and to finish a dessert cart came by to see the great choices. Yum!"}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I had the option. I don't normally post stuff like this but I am not a happy camper. I asked my husband if he could go to lunch with me & we wanted to try this place since people have told us how good it was. I emailed them, on line, you can either call or email for reservations, didn't hear back from them. We walked in, there were 3 of us, nobody there to help us. I had to find someone. She said the only table for 3 was out where the bar was, it was freezing but took it anyway. She didn't even give us menus, just walked away. So, after about 10 minutes, I walked into the kitchen & asked for someone to at least give us menus & maybe set the table & get water. He says to me \" we are taking care of the reserved tables first\" I ignored it, but wasn't happy that he said that. Got menus, still no one came over to at least give us waters. A girl answered the phone & came out where we were & STILL ignored us!!! So, after about another 5 minutes another girl came out, as we decided to leave, I couldn't hold it in. So, I said you know this is our first time in here & have been waiting now over 15 minutes for someone to at least acknowledge us or get water & no one has helped us. And for you to only help only the people that made reservations & ignore a walk in is ridiculous!!! You know what she said \" I'm sorry, you should of made reservations\" Are you f**king kidding me?! You just said that?!!!! Wow! So unprofessional!! I'm so glad my husband was on the phone at the time. He was about to blow his gasket!!  I was shaking I was so pissed!!!!! Rude Rude !!!"}
{"text":"Very awesome restaurant! The food is very well prepared and the service is top notch! The decor let's you know you are in a boutique French restaurant and not a chain restaurant! The 3 entrees special let's you try different dishes at a reasonable price! I highly recommend going to this restaurant! Even got a very nice Happy Birthday Deseret!"}
{"text":"Great french restaurant. I am french and I felt like it tasted like back home. My wife loved the beef medallions, I had the fish and my kids had the chicken tenders. The mushroom soup was full of flavors and was awesome. Loved the cake selection. Last but not the least, it was my son's graduation and they surprised us with a cake and \"happy graduation\" written in chocolate syrup. He was so happy."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! We typically go here for dinner or for Sunday brunch...where caviar, champagne, sauce, waiters in tuxs, and dessert are all normal fare. Louis is a prince of a man and I've head hes trying to sell the building, so enjoy this classic place while you can. Not sure how long he can keep on keepn' on. His makes the melba toast himself and the good is to die for. This is a must visit place!!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed by the lack of good restaurants in Anthem, we decided to branch out and look at other nearby towns. We are so glad we did!!  We went to Le Sans Souci on a Sunday early around 5pm and ordered the 3 course meals for $20/pp. My husband had the Orange Roughy, and it was perfect. My daughter had the veal marsala and cleaned her plate, while I went for the beef Medallions, and chose chef's choice on the prep - it melts in the mouth. We also \"splurged\" and ordered the escargot for an appetizer. At $8 it was a BARGAIN, and even better than Mastro's Ocean Club in Scottsdale (served traditionally in-shell)... My 12 year old ate almost all of them on her onesie! The executive chef is a pastry chef, and the small desserts included with the 3 courses were out of this world. Kiddo chose the eclair, and we had the lemon tart with a caramel filling and the chocolate fudge ball. Even though we were NOT hungry, I ordered the creme brulee (just to try it - personal favorite dessert). And while the custard was perfect, I found the sugar topping a tad thick for my taste. Oh! And for first course, you have the option of soup or salad - kiddo went with the French onion, and my husband and I wished we had too. It was clearly the first course winner!"}
{"text":"Steak was good, soup decent. Overpriced for what i got but all in all it was fine. Will come back for salad etc but not entrees due to cost. Not bad, not amazing"}
{"text":"Yelped romantic dinner in my area and Le Sans popped up. French in Cave Creek? Very unusual. It was our anniversary so we tried it.  The outside has a lot to be updated, along with decor on the inside. We almost drove away. We took a chance and were pleasantly surprised. The service was spot on! We had warm potato leek soup to start. Very nice, thick and tasty. 
Then we continued with a house salad with a nice vinegar based dressing and a bottle of delicious white wine.  Main course, petit filet mignon. 
Cooked to perfection. They surprised us with an anniversary dessert. Overall the meal and the service was magnificent. The 70's decor is keeping it from the 5 stars. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious French food. The restaurant is just lovely and the servers were unbelievably sweet and polite. My two little boys, who are the pickiest eaters I know, loved their meal very much. The inside of the restaurant reminded me of a traditional French dining area. I felt I was in France. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and delicious service
At this super french bistro
Everything's divine from soup
To salad
To stake to seafood
Our favorite local eats and great wine selection
Not a morsel of mediocre can be found here"}
{"text":"We were on vacation and wanted French food - I brought a restaurant.com coupon, which was honored without a problem.  The proprietor is very kind and gracious, and it truly felt like a \"mom and pop\" hole in the wall that treats you like family.  We came on a Wednesday evening, and there were a couple of regulars there, which was nice.  Our food was crazy good.  I had the diver sole, my husband the seafood dish that they prepare tableside.  Service was outstanding.  This was by far the best grand marnier soufle we've ever had, and my husband is a connoisseur in that arena!  We get one at every French restaurant we go to, and anywhere else that has it on the menu, and this was a notch above all others we've tried.  I have to be honest, it doesn't look like much, and we almost doubted about whether we should go in, but I'm so glad we did.  The decor inside was old french country and very cute.  I wouldn't say that it was really dated or run down, though, as other reviewers have stated.  I've been to many french restaurants with similar decor - and they're usually the best -  it's a charming place for a good dinner and we want to come back whenever we're in the area."}
{"text":"We were a party of 10 that went on Cristmas day, although the food was very good...the service, for the second year in a row, was the worst I have ever experienced! There were only 2 parties seated in our section so it didnt appear that it was because they were overwhelmed with customers, but nonetheless we were at least a half an hour between asking for wine refills and actually getting them, not to mention the wait time between courses was ridiculous...so a leisurely 1 pm lunch turned into a four hour wait for dinner to be served...I would never choose to go there because I despise poor service, especially since the tip was included automatically, but because we go there with family, this is their chosen christmas dining spot...if they stepped up their service, this would be a five star for me!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! 
This was honestly one of the best experiences I've ever had a a restaurant. When j first arrived it was quiet and nice for the romantic dinner I had planned. The staff was super polite and were very attentive. I had ordered a five course meal as well as trying escargot. Simply amazing! There was ever live music! And soft ambient lighting. Best place I've eaten so far."}
{"text":"Very French and I loved that I did not know what half the menu meant. Not your typical fare. Delicious Filet and amazing dover sole a la meuniere cooked perfectly. Definitely did not go home even thinking about attempting to duplicate that! Perfect and Special!!"}
{"text":"French restaurants are few and far between in the US these days.  This place was a throwback to another era.  The menu was straight out of a old fashioned French restaurant.  Onion soup.  Chateaubriand.  Soufflé.  The quality was great and the service friendly.  The wine list was reasonable.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We took clients to have lunch at San Souci. Lovely restaurant in a restored home.  White tablecloths like entering a small European Hotel.  Lovely wine selection served with a flair. 
My salmon (served grilled or poached)  I chose poached was terrific. Done spot on. Service was attentive but not overbearing.  I am not a desert person but the almond tart was wonderful. Don't miss San Souci."}
{"text":"Amazing food and perfect service. Small and intimate setting. Best hollandaise sauce I've had in years. Will be back next week for my daughter's birthday. Delicious! All pastries are made on site by the chef."}
{"text":"Being a Chevalier in the Chaines des Rotisseurs, I appreciate good food and wine and, despite living close to Le Sans Souci, my wife and I had never eaten there since moving to the area 6 years ago.  Went there on our anniversary and was delighted.  The food was DELICIOUS and served piping HOT.  The owner who is a very elederly gentleman was very charming.  Gret menu and wine selections.  It's a Winner ! You feel more like you are in a fine French restaurant in the countryside of that country than Cave Creek.  It was GREAT !!!!"}
{"text":"Always looking for escargot and French onion soup. The escargot was prepared in the classic way, which is how we like it. Nothing fancy schmantzy just delicious. Ordered the pate also and was also good. The star of the show had to be the soup, which was spot on ! Well prepared and importantly served piping hot. Thank you San Souci, we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Have never had Veal Cordon Bleu with Bar-B-Q sauce before.   It was terrible.   The waiter said they \"always\" did it that way.   I know better.   I even had them cook it for an event THEY catered at my home.   It is not the same as when Louis was there.   I won't go back."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful flavors and the perfect place to splurge on a special date for two.  Pricey but worth it.

I saw Wayne's tip about the coupon at http://www.restaurant.com/le-sans-souci-french-restaurant-cave-creek-french-pid=36877 and bought one too.  Seated nearly immediately in a restaurant that was just over half full.
We heeded fellow Yelpers' advice and got Escargo, Ceasar salad, brochette and duck l'orange for our dinner selection.  Portions were on par or larger with great flavors that were wonderful.  Ms. D is a Francophile and was very impressed which made me happy.

Dessert was Creme Brulee for her and Chocolate Mousse for I with great coffee.  Desserts were far too big for us as was the after dinner drink.  My Grand Marnier must have been a double!

Excellent food, proper service and a great selection lends this an easy 5 star review"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service in a quiet atmosphere with very reasonable prices for the quality!"}
{"text":"We arrived here about 5:30 on Wednesday for dinner and we were seated promptly in the main dinning area. Our server, Erica, greeted us right away and took our drink orders. 
I ordered the lobster thermidor and my wife ordered the filet. We also had Caesar salad made for us at table side and it was terrific! Our meals arrived promptly and both entrees were extremely good! We finished off the evening with creme brûlée that was also very good. The dinner was pretty expensive but the exceptional food made the cost understandable.
I think some of the bad reviews were by customers who went to dinner on a busy Friday or Saturday evening at prime time. This is supposed to be special French restaurant not a fast food experience! It seems like most of us now want instant gratification wherever we go.
As far as the inside decor is concerned, we found it to be charming in a retro kind of way. Nice to eat somewhere without neon lights or 20 TV's staring you in the face!
Give this restaurant a shot, especially an early dinner during the week."}
{"text":"My favorite resturant in AZ; a GEM!  I have been coming here since I arrived in AZ in 1996. I love the table side service!  I like the atmosphere and food is great and I love the cherries jubilee for desert!"}
{"text":"Outrageous prices!
Slow ass service!
Bland food!
Are you over 90 and some wealthy Scottsdale Snow Bird?  Hate food with flavor?  Want to sit around and complain all dinner long?  This is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Okay, a few questions. 1) Why isn't this place advertised better and 2) Why wasn't it packed? I ate there on a Monday evening using a restaurants.com coupon to try it out based on some recommendations. Simply outstanding. The owner, Louis is fantastic and I wish I had his energy even at my age!

I had the fresh Caesar salad, escargot. stuffed mushroom and baked lobster tails. My wife had the Lobster Thermidor. for dessert it was a Grand Marnier Souffle.

I simply cannot say enough about the food. Everything was perfect. I had forgotten all the ingredients that go into a REAL Caesar Salad, but the preparation tableside quickly reminded me what I had been missing from restaurants that use a generic Caesar dressing. The salad was simply out of this world.

Maybe the prices scare off some customers but I've learned most often, you get what you pay for. Definitely applicable in this case. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Favorite place to come in Phoenix. You will feel instantly transported into a European time warp, and like you are somehow nestled in a mountainous village in France . Will refrain from elaborating too much on the 4 course dining experience; you just have to come for yourself and experience Le San Souci! Which in French means 'without worry, or care.'"}
{"text":"I would agree with previous reviewer, what a great find in this area of the country, old school French.

Strange being waited on with people speaking Spanish, but don't let that fool you, Soup, Main Entree, Salad, dessert were all wonderful, I wish
I would of found this place earlier during our week long visit to this area.

We are still raving about finding this place, wish we had a similar place here in Colorado !"}
{"text":"Le Sans Souci French restaurant is a gem in the AZ desert. We ordered from the lunch special menu and it was both delicious and very reasonable. We both ordered French Onion soup, the salad (iceberg lettuce!!) with Roquefort dressing, chicken piccata and dessert. (I had the Napoleon and my friend had the Cheesecake.) Coffee was included in the price of under $20. The service was good. The patrons at the next table talked on their cell phones. It was annoying. The management should ask patrons to turn off their phones as a courtesy. I will return."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for my birthday and had a wonderful dinner. I had the escargot and he had the onion soup. Both were wonderful! I had the Veal Oscar, very well prepared. My husband had the Beef Bernaise. Wonderful. The perfect ending to our perfect meal was the Grand Marnier Soufflé. The soufflé was fabulous. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I love it here! Love the owner, love the food, love the ridiculously dated decor! Love it! 
My husband and I went for the first time last Saturday and I cant wait to go back and try new dishes. 
The only rough part of the night was trying to discreetly google the menu and figure out what everything meant. We finally gave up and just asked the waiter, much easier! 
It just seems like its one server in charge of the whole place, so I kind of felt like we were bothering him with all our questions. He didn't make it feel like that, but I could just tell how busy he was. 
So for an appetizer we got the coquilles st jacques (sp?) and it was small but really good. Maybe that appetizer is always small? I have no idea! I got the lobster thermadore for dinner, it was really good. So buttery. Which is totally the way to my heart....buttery lobster...mmmm. My husband got the steak diane which is made table side and there's lots of flames and drama! It was pretty cool. It was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was AMAZING. I was pretty drunk from the bottle of wine at this point, so I think the chocolate souffle for dessert was awesome, but I'm not totally sure because I also think Taco Bell is awesome when I'm drunk. 
We were (by far) the youngest people there, but whatever. It was great and I want to go back. Tonight, preferably! We got a gift certificate from restaurant.com for $50 of $100 and with appetizers, wine, dinner, and dessert, the bill was about $200 after the $50 off. For sure get the coupon, next time, I'll get the $75 off of $150, because this place isn't cheap..."}
{"text":"This classic french restaurant is a jewel in the desert.  An unexpected pleasure located in Cave Creek, amongst the eclectic mix of country and rock n' roll bars.  

The Oysters Rockefeller were delicious, the Chateaubriand with Hollandaise sauce was lean, tender and flavorful, and the Grand Marnier Souffle is always decadent and cooked to perfection.

The decor is very dated, but this is to me what gives the place so much charm.  It's a little bit of France, in the desert.  There is nothing pretencious about this place.  

Love it!  It was a great place to enjoy my last meal of 2010."}
{"text":"Not a very busy or attractive restaurant but don't let that fool you.  The dinner experience didn't start off so well, but it got really good later on. My wife and I ordered a glass of pinot grigio and it was very cloudy and tasted watered down. So I asked the waiter to bring out the bottle and it was a bottle of House Pinot Grigio that I've had before,but the wine in the bottle was much clearer than what was in our glasses. Not really sure what  was all about.

I started off with a wilted spinach salad. It was delicious. The preparation for the salad takes place table side where they saute the bacon in a pan then cover the spinach with the hot pan so that the spinach becomes wilted.

My main course was Eastern scallops. The scallops look to be flashed in a little bit of flower and they were delicious. The homemade au gratin potatoes came along with it as a side and the steamed vegetables were perfect. My wife had the petite filet that was cooked to perfection. Surprisingly , the petite filet was much larger than any of the other steak houses in the Phoenix area . Hands down it's one of the best filets that I've ever had

To close the night out we went with banana fosters made tableside for all four of us. I haven't had it in a long time and man was it good!

I give this restaurant 4 stars not because of the drink situation earlier, but I'm not a real big fan of live keyboard singer music during dinner. You have to be really really really good to pull that off."}
{"text":"Dinner with friends on valentines day - food pricing absurd - service lousy. Many better choices."}
{"text":"The food was good, but do not expect a fine French experience. It is Cave Creek after all. A French speaking server would be a nice touch, and a better wine selection would really be appreciated. Still, it's a unique menu for the area and a very quaint ambience."}
{"text":"Old school French not at its best from a culinary standpoint but pretty darn good when all other things are considered. Be greeted by the 85+ year old proprietor and step back in time when you enter this eclectic restaurant surrounded by cowboy saloons and saguaros. The prices can't be beat... a prix fixe meal with soup, salad, entree, coffee, and dessert can be had for close to $20. I had the coq au vin and can say it was good but keep in mind this place is not Zinc Bistro style, but more Paris-esque circa 1945. If you like old style French it's worth a trip up to Cave Creek to check this diamond in the rough out."}
{"text":"I read some of the other reviews and I don't we think ate at the same restaurant.  5 stars?  Are you kidding me?

Some friends took us to this dump.  On a Saturday evening the place was jumping!  I ordered onion soup to start.  When it arrived it was luke-warm instead of pipping hot.  The taste was nonexistent.  

Then a server, who turned to to be a busboy, said to me, \"chez\".  It was loud, I couldn't really hear him and I didn't know what he said.  \"Chez\", like, Chev?

\"Chez?\"  He was saying \"cheese\" and in his hand he had a bowl of Kraft pre-grated, cheap-ass imitation parmesan cheese.  Not freshly-grated, canned cheese on an onion soup that was weaker than consume'.

I refused to order an entrée.

1 star is one too many for this place.  I don't know who Louis is or why he left but 

DO NOT GO TO THIS DUMP!"}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this restaurant for awhile and went yesterday for a special occasion celebration.  There was no one to greet us when we went in, so we sat down at a table in the empty bar and waited for several minutes before a server came into the bar to prepare a bill for one of her tables.  She came back a few minutes later to seat us and apologized for the delay but said they were understaffed for the night.  The service was marginal the entire time we were there, in spite of the restaurant not being full.  The food was good, especially the Dover sole and the chocolate soufflé so the evening wasn't a total disappointment.  When we were leaving, we asked the server to cork our bottle of wine so we could take it with us - to our surprise, they wrapped it in aluminum foil!  Definitely not legal!  The restaurant, both inside and out, is in desperate need of a good cleaning and a renovation.  The prices are high and the service was just ok.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Lovely country French decor.  A menu to die for and cooked to perfection.  The only restaurant in Cave Creek/Carefree that I would return to again... and again... and again.
The only warning... do not go if you are looking for big obnoxious sports screens or loud rock in the background.  Soft piano music and a conversationally quiet atmosphere was perfect"}
{"text":"I got a restaurant.com certificate and tried this restaurant.  Based on the reviews, I fully expected to have an expensive, but worth it meal.  That didn't happen.  I'm a little biased because I got to spend some time in France last summer and had wonderful food! 

Three people were in my party.  We arrived and there were two other parties there.  We waited while the waiter acknowledged us and directed us to our table.  He brought us butter for the crackers on the table.  The butter was freezer burnt.  We looked at the wine menu and noticed that the Chardonnay said 2001 (I learned that Chardonnay doesn't keep well - no more than three years at best.)  The waiter checked and it was a 2007 - still older than we wanted.  We asked, if the wine has started to turn, can we get a different bottle.  He told us once the bottle was opened, there were no returns.  (Wow!  I've been in restaurants who have given me a different glass of wine just because I didn't like what I ordered.  Not that I do that regularly, but it's happened!)

We chose a different bottle of wine and ordered the Caesar salad (made table-side) to share as well as our entrees.  Since the waiter was the host, he would stop in the middle of preparing our salad to go seat people who had just walked in.  The Caesar was ok - too much Worcestershire for my liking.  I would eat it again, but wouldn't go there just for the Caesar.  

I ordered the filet medallions and my friends both ordered seafood.  The sauces for our food were fantastic.  The seafood was good.  My filet - not so much.  If I had to guess, I would say it was USDA Choice (like you would get at Fry's or Basha's) instead of restaurant-quality or USDA Prime Aged beef.  And instead of three beautiful medallions, it looks like they took a regular filet, and butterflied it twice.  So, it was not cooked to temperature.  The potatoes were horrible - very disappointing.  

Our bill came to $216, including wine and tip.  For a really fabulous meal, I would have been fine with that.  This meal wasn't even close to that good.   

I see so many people who have had positive experiences - maybe it's the time of year (summer is very slow in this area)?  Also, I have very high food standards - just moved here from a city that was filled with exceptional restaurants with stellar service.  This just didn't cut the mustard for me."}
{"text":"FABULOUS food! If you're looking for \"snob appeal,\" you won't find it here - what you WILL find is freshly baked bread (heavenly) and medallions of beef, rare, so tender you can cut it with a fork... i love food, and this was hands-down, the best meal i've ever eaten in my life! A bit pricey, but the 3 course \"Happy Hour\" is affordable. Bon appetite, and ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"It is a true favorite of ours! Nightly specials are always a great choice. I would recommend the soufflé but make sure you order it when you order the entrees because it take 30 minutes to prepare. 
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"MY GOD.....the escargot is phenomenal.

I first found out about this place through the Taste of Cave Creek food festival.  They've had a booth consistently there for the last few years at least and they typically serve fresh French pastries which are ridiculously delicious.

I went here with a friend to celebrate a promotion at work a few months ago and now that I'm actively contributing to yelp I wanted to share my experience.  She had a seafood dish and I had a steak.  Both were prepared tableside and were excellent.  I'd never been to a traditional French restaurant but I was not let down by the experience at all.

Prior to moving to Phoenix I'd always been a picky eater and ever since deciding to try other foods I never would have I've really branched out.  I had to try the escargot.  it was freaking amazing.  You have to get it if you come here.

All in all it was a great experience.  I expected it to be pricey and they certainly were but once again, quality."}
{"text":"Great French food at this little gem way up north in Cave Creek near Care Free. Kudos to the Chief!! However the wait staff needs to learn the menu better and get familiar with the wine list. Simple questions I asked could not be answered. This surprised me for a French restaurant of this caliber. If the service was better I would have given 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"Bad experience!  Had checked out this restaurant online and after a day of fun w/ friends at the Hideaway ( right down the street ) I took my girl in to try their French Onion Soup.  I've been dying to see how great their soup is at $14 a bowl.  When we came in the person in front was busy seating a couple so we grabbed a seat at the bar.  After several minutes of not seeing a bartender, nor being advised there actually WAS NO BARTENDER,...we asked someone if we could get a menu and a cocktail.  We were told the bar wasn't open on Sundays.  No problem,...can we be seated?  The guy who we later found to be the manager smugly asked if we had a reservation?  We said no but we only stopped in to try the soup.    We were advised that without a reservation we could not be seated.  This was very early... maybe 4-5 and the place couldn't have been more than 10% full yet we were refused service.  Plan B we had a $200 dinner at Cartwright's down the street.... was EXCELLENT btw.

Shame on you Le Sans Souci for being arrogant, rude and unaccommodating.  Did you forget you're in the \"Service\" industry?"}
{"text":"While it was my first visit, this is known as a local classic.   Starting with the owner.  The food, while pricey, was quite delicious.   The ambiance, sadly, is very outdated, and the average diner age was well into their 70's.  If you know this and are ready for it, its fine.  I wasn't."}
{"text":"Been here before, but tonight was very disappointing. Food was just ok, service was horrible   Ceasar salad was not good (hard to mess that up).  After our food was served, the waitress disappear and never returned. The bus boy asked us about coffee and dessert. She was still around, but spent more time at the bar than serving the tables."}
{"text":"I picked this restaurant as it was for a birthday celebration. What a fantastic meal. As stated before, the Décor leaves a bit to be desired but the service  the food and the atmosphere was C'est Magnifique!"}
{"text":"This Is a strange but ultimately a good place. Wife got the steak Diane which was excellent. I had the duck which was good but wasn't as tender as I'd like. Soufflé was divine and Oysters Rock were simple but amazing. 

Not much French stuff here other than the menu. The French wine list is weak. Burgundy is misspelled (Burgandy). American wine list was better. Bread wasn't anything to speak of. Erica our server was a sweetheart but service was a tad slow. It's also very expensive for the area. 

All that said, we had a very good meal with a nice American Cabernet and an amazing soufflé. We'll go back."}
{"text":"We went for my Father in Law's birthday. What a treat! It was fine dining all the way but with a casual atmosphere. The service was impeccable! Our waitress knew the menu and the wine pairings perfectly and was a very sweet girl. The Food! It was delicious! We started with the oysters and ordered everything, Salmon, Duck, Lamb and Chicken and each had only good things to say. Finish it off with Chocolate souffle! We each left wondering why we don't come more often. They are back in our regular rotation of local restaurants for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent service - visiting the area and while we do not frequent French restaurants in the states, we thought we would try an adventure- wine list was ample and found a lovely Bordeaux- chef/owner pays attention to detail - escargot was excellent- French onion soup - excellent -- vichyssoise was my favorite-- lamp chops were superb-- cheese plate not on the menu so be sure to ask -- all desserts made on site ---- give it a try!!"}
{"text":"We haven't commented on these kinds of sites in the past, but the time has come.  Le Sans Souci is one of a kind.  We were introduced to Louis and his team 15 years ago when we first moved to the Valley.  Of course over the years there have been a few changes, but our enjoyment and the quality of our meals has not changed.  

Living in Fountain HIlls makes a visit to Le Sans Souci in Cave Creek a journey, but one we gladly make as often as possible, usually at least  once a month.  Often we take guests with us as we know they will be as pleased as we have been--and they are never disappointed.

While excellent meals are prevelent throught the Valley, Le Sans Souci is a cut above.  The extra \"ingredient\" is the staff that takes them one step above the rest.  Yes, because of the years we may received \"special\" treatment.  But from our experience  Augustine, Jose, Aricella, and the others who make the visit special, always provide  professional attention and service to all.

So what explains some folks' reviews that are less than satisfactory?  We don't know having not been there when they were disappointed.  Our praise of Le Sans Souci is based on 15 years, not a single moment in time.

{"text":"Happy New Years!  I had probably the worst meal I have had at a restaurant in 10 years.  Filet Wellington was a huge lump of bad pastry
covered with some kind of brown glop.  The filet was over cooked and 
I am guessing it was not a filet as it did not have the consistency of filet.
As a French restaurant we tried to order a Bordeaux from the wine list.
No Bordeaux for us as they had none in house.  When I got home I ate a pastry to get the Wellington taste out.
The service is odd as only one person in the whole place could take orders or bring a check, even though the place was over flowing with employees. By the way, these employees banged our chairs all night.
The only reason for a star at all was the piano player/singer.  She was 
great. At $200+ we should have stayed home."}
{"text":"My birthday surprise dinner was fabulous 
Veal picatta & orange roughy. Oysters Rockefeller 
& desserts to die for. Experienced courteous friendly service   Had exceptional soufflé previously 
Can't wait to return   A few steps from our home a real French restaurant."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant last night, and what a treat. Delicious French cuisine. We were early, and enjoyed the early bird three course meal.  Soup or salad, a main and dessert for under $20.00.  My wife and I started with the house salad. I had the Sole Meunière. It was lightly breaded and cooked to perfection. My wife enjoyed the Salmon. We both had a light and tasty puff pastry for dessert. Fabulous French food in Cave Creek. Believe it! And by the way, best to make a reservation; the restaurant was packed."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars I would! Prices are a little pricey although that's the cost of high quality! Service is beyond great and the food is extremely of the highest quality. If you have ever been overseas and stepping into a European café, this is the epitome of just that, alethic in everyway. You just don't have one sever to your table, they all work together as a team and continually make sure all your requests and needs are promptly taken care of. Don't miss out on this gem, you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food all around! Appetizers, entrees, and dessert! A must eat! Best restaurant in town! Outstanding service! Family owned and ran. Fantastic food that you can't forget! Lobster, steak, bananas fosters, scallops, and snails will blow you away!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! I just had a fabulous meal. The flavors and cooking was perfect! It was prepared better than I could do. If you are looking for a good, out of the way, intimate restaurant with unbelievably prepared food, awesome service and quiet, private ambience; this is the place. Try it, you won't forget, and want to come back."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and wasn't disapponted.  The place is small and quaint, but with old-school waiter service rarely seen anymore.  We started with the escargot for me and watercress soup for my hubs.  Both were phenominal.  I then had the seafood trio (lobster, scallop and shrimp) flambe tableside which was also very good and a generous portion.  Hubs got the veal marsala which was ok, and a small portion (good thing I had seafood to spare).  We finished with a strawberry tart for him and cheesecake for me, both were great and I'm not a huge cheesecake fan, but I finished all of this one!  Cons for us was that for a french restaurant the wine list was small and uninspired, the vegetable was preactically nonexistant, and the bread was pretty blah.  Yes, it is pricy, but good for a special occasion and something different."}
{"text":"Love love this place. My family and I have been going here for years and just love it! The caesar salad is phenomenal as well as the escargot and the soufflé. Highly recommend it if you are in the area and can afford an expensive yet delicious French meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful old-style country French. Dinner combined with restaurant.com a real bargin, allowing a better bottle of wine. Very attentive service, even from the elderly owner. Perfect for that special occaison."}
{"text":"Delicious and a lovely atmosphere. Yes, it's very French, offers escargot & la grenouille! The champagne by the glass is decent too. We had seafood flambé and the servers couldn't be lovelier.
I will return, whenever I visit Az. It's an overall pleasant surprise to find this caliber of fine dining restaurant amid all the steak places."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Sans Souci for about 5 years since we moved here. It is in the quirky town of Cave Creek, and has views of the mountains. The place feels like you are in someone's home getting a delicious home cooked meal. The place is charming and is not your typical sanitized chain restaurant. I hope they never redecorate. 
They actually make a table-side ceasar salad. The Escargot is perfectly done. The service is always friendly and efficient. We always enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"What a great find hidden in Cave Creek.  Quiet and intimate. Caesar salad made tableside.  Entrees are wonderful.  Service is attentive.  This is really fine dining where you least expect it!!!  They also have early bird specials."}
{"text":"THIS IS BEST FRENCH RESTAURANT IN ALL ARIZONA!
   My wife and I had a super dinner there last evening.
We started with wine.  I had an Italian Pinot Grigio and my wife had a great Louis Latour Chardonnay.  Both were excellent.
  We started with bowl of vichyssois.  It came with small breads for dipping.  It was very good.
  My main course was Steak au poivre and my wife had Beef medalions.
Both came with potatoes and asparagas.  The steak was one of the best with sauces they provided.
  We had red wine to go with dinner.  I had French Cab. ; and my wife had a Pinot noir.
  Our waiter was Erica Rivera who was extra sharp, quick on suggestions,and, helpful in taking photos, bringing extra ice, etc.  I would ask for her table again.
  Go there.  You will not be disappointed.

Sincerely,

Ed Altman  Jr."}
