{"text":"Fantastic service from mom and daughter. Love the spicy wings and the generous pad Thai."}
{"text":"I decided to actually order anyway. Food is great. Best Thai place in Pickering!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have found in Pickering, get the spicy basil chicken it's legit. Get extra spicy if you love spicy food like I do!"}
{"text":"There is a reason your friends keep telling you to go here. This is incredible flavour, reasonable prices, and friendly service; whether dining in or taking out.  \"But there's a thai restaurant in the food court at the mall, why don't I just go there? It's all the same, right?\" I hear you ask.  You've got some attitude, mister.  The menu here is simplified to about 15-20 dishes, all of which are incredible. Like spicy things? They've got spicy things. Like non-spicy things? They've got non spicy things. Like spaghetti?  They don't have that. But they have other dishes with noodles that are well worth trying.  A word of advice for first timers, get the Pad Mama. It's a spin on a pad thai dish (which they also have) that I order pretty much every dang time I go there.   If I had to ding it for something; the interior of the restaurant is not the nicest looking place (you can tell that they deal mostly in takeout), but it's comfy, quiet , and as said before service is prompt.   Stop reading this review and go eat here.  You have to stop reading because I'm done now."}
{"text":"NOT mama noi's!! I was shocked at the takeout they served me. The red curry has gone bad it smelled sour and the coconut milk had separated. It concerns me that their cook deemed that safe to eat. We had to drive all the way back to the restaurant for a refund. We also ordered the chicken pad Thai which was flavourless and barely had any chicken pieces in it. I will certainly never return."}
{"text":"Def some of the best Thai food I have ever had!! Been back many times highly recommend trying!"}
{"text":"I tried Hot Mama Noi's for the first time yesterday, and thoroughly enjoyed my green curry dish.  As others have said, Mama does come out to speak to you personally.  My only suggestion would be that they offer yogurt based drinks to tame the curry a bit.  It was delicious, but water isn't as good a dinner companion as a yogurt based drink..."}
{"text":"I must say this place is a hidden gem tucked away in the business area.  probably why they close earlier than their real closing time.  yes, call to confirm they are open if you are within they're 2 hour of closing.  I had the green curry beef and everything was given proportionally correct.  at first i thought it was not enough, but i ended up being very full and satisfied. mind you i had one fried spring roll, which was very, very good.  must go back."}
{"text":"Very small restaurant with sketchy hours, we got there just before 7pm and they were already closing, but very good food.  It is next to the Pickering Go station and I think they gear the hours toward the commuters, so not a huge amount of seating.  I got the pad thai and it was some of the best I have ever had, and more authentic than most thai restaurants.  The owner/chef actually studied in Thailand and has her diploma on display.  If you are there, give it a try and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Overall great food! I recommend the sweet and sour chicken and mommas pad Thai. Portions were on the small side but quite fresh and the customer service was great! Will 100% be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go to Hot Mama's based on a recommendation from a friend. While we enjoyed the meals, which we felt were good portions for the price despite other people's comments, we felt that the food was average. We had Pad Thai, Beef Spicy Basil and spring rolls. The spring rolls were very good, as was the Beef Spicy Basil. However, the Pad Thai noodles were overcooked and not as favourable as we had expected. We'll certainly try it one more time, but our favourite place in Durham is still iThai in Whitby."}
{"text":"After a killer exercise class, my fellow workout friends were hungry and insisted we go to Mama Noi's. They are from the Pickering area and said it's one of their favourites. I can't say no to Thai food, so I tagged along.  Located close to the Pickering GO Station, we entered a small restaurant with glass tables. My first thought was that they would all see how messy I am when I'm eating. Damn. They offered Ginger Tea, Green Tea and the usual assortment of pop and water. Some loved the ginger tea, others not so much. I love that they give you a full size pot instead of those leaky, single serving tea pots.  The menu is 1 page, double sided and full of irresistible choices. Almost everyone ordered something different, so I really got to see a variety of dishes they offer. My friends were disappointed that Mama Noi herself was not there. They said that she will greet her guests to make sure everything tastes to their liking. They said she is very friendly and pleasant; I was sad I didn't get to meet her!   My friends ordered the Sweet & Sour Chicken, Pineapple Fried Rice, Pad Thai & Pad See Eew. I had the Masaman Chicken. The couple that frequent this place had the Pad Thai and Pad See Eew. The Tom Yum Soup is highly recommended by them. They've tried many things on the menu and had no complaints about any of them. The couple that shared the Sweet & Sour Chicken and Pineapple Fried Rice enjoyed it. They expected the Sweet & Sour to be more like the Chinese style, but still liked it. My Masaman Chicken(I say it wrong every time) was fantastic. Lots of sauce to eat with the rice and the smell was divine; it was making everyone else hungrier! The veggies were tender and cooked in the sauce with a good amount of chicken.   The prices are very reasonable and the service was great. I can't wait to go back. I want to try something else and meet Mama!"}
{"text":"Small menu, but they do each item very well.  Friendly service.  Reasonable prices.  Good portions.  I wish they had a lunch special.  Masaman chicken curry is my favourite!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Definitely recommend giving this place a try. Very casual dining with awesome food"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my \"to-do\" list for a while now and I finally got the chance to go.   Our first attempt was a failure as their debit/credit machine was down and were only accepting something called \"cash\". Huh. Oh well, off to our favourite Indian place instead.   Our next attempt was a hit! The restaurant was empty and we were told to sit wherever we wanted. We selected a table and my husband went to use the restroom before settling in to peruse the menu. He quickly returned to the counter asking for the key...?  I looked at him and mouthed \"the key?\" to which, he shrugged and returned to the restroom with said key in hand.   Meanwhile a mother and her young child had entered the restaurant. The mother immediately went to the counter to either place or pickup their order and the young girl, who appeared to be busting at the seams, went off to the restroom.   As my husband was just exiting, he handed the key to the girl and as he retuned to our table, advised the lady who had given the key to him.   Mistake.   My husband was reprimanded for doing this and was instructed that, in future, the key MUST be retuned to her.   Our order placing was rushed and almost seemed to be an inconvenience. The restaurant had started to fill up so that's fair, I guess.   The food came and I was satisfied with the portion size but admittedly, I expected more for the price.  I ordered Mussaman Curry with chicken and it was really quite good. I don't know of any other Thai place in Pickering that offered Mussaman Curry and it's definitely one of my favourite dishes so I was happy to see it and simply had to order it! My husband ordered the Cashew Chicken. We also ordered some spring rolls just to live on the edge.   Everything we ordered tasted great and I left with a happy belly... I'm just not convinced with the experience. I have often thought of my curry dish since that night and I will likely go back to get it again... but I think next time, I'll opt for a takeaway instead."}
{"text":"Cashew chicken and red curry chicken very good.  Portions a bit small.  4 spring rolls for 8 bucks is a lot to charge.  I liked it but it was pricey."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Love their chicken pad thai! The food is always consistently delicious! The only problem with this place is service is usually pretty slow."}
{"text":"This is right up there with some of my favourite Thai restaurants and is my favourite restaurant in the Pickering area.  I love pad Thai so that is definitely a go to choice for me but the spicy basil is also delicious as are the curries.    Just a heads up that this is restaurant is focused on the food and not the decor.  The owner is very passionate about the food and is proud to use quality ingredients cooking from scratch.  The menu is simple but good."}
{"text":"Wow.  Went to Horn Dawg's yesterday not realizing it was closed on Mondays so my colleague and I decided to go next door to Hot Mama Noi's instead. And am I ever glad I did.  The food is incredible. Fast, fresh, delicious, huge portions... I actually barely had dinner last night because I was so full from lunch. Between incredible spring rolls and delicious green curry I was totall happy with the experience, and want more already."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant has excellent service and the dishes are good.   We like the red curry, green curry, pad thai & spring rolls."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  Went there with fairly high expectations after reading other reviews and I must say, I was a little disappointed.  Walked in to order takeout and the smell of food wafting from an open kitchen and the actual Thai staff definitely seemed promising.    I ordered Pad Woon Sen (shrimp) and Massaman Curry (chicken).  Granted that both dishes were consumed after a few hours, they help up pretty well.  My disappointment was from the flavours themselves.  Both dishes were fairly well executed with complex enough flavours but just too sweet for my liking.  They were both much better after adding a heaping spoonfuls of Nguoc Nam and another sauce they provide.  The hot pepper sauce was right up my alley and not vinegary at all.    I would probably go back to try different dishes but my vote for best Thai still stands with Siamese Gecko in Collingwood.  Alas, I can't possibly drive 1.5 hrs every time I get a Thai craving."}
{"text":"I think one word will describe this place: Simple  The place is small and simply decorated. Looks like a family run business. The menu is one page and double sided.   Ordered the Masaman with shrimp $11.99 - very simple ingridents which consisted of onions, cashew nuts, potatoes and carrots. The sauce had its coconut milk flavour and had a nice sweet taste to it. The shrimps were fresh and large and there were 6 of them. Yes, I counted how many shrimps there were and I do it for all you guys and gals out there reading reviews.   For $11.99 you can't go wrong. The only thing I can complain about is the limited selection on the menu. They could use an appetizer section. I usually order satay chicken in Thai restaurants but sadly they do not have them here."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  This place is truly a hole in the wall.   Arriving at the GO station, I had a choice between going to the Pickering Town Centre for lunch, but brought up the Yelp app and found this place right beside it. Needless to say I decided to try it out given the excellent reviews.  Now as I was saying about hole in the wall...there's literally no decorations in here. It's basically a unit with some tables, kitchen, and then you pay at the cashier. Very simple, and with that the prices are lower than most other Thai places. I had the chicken pad thai, which tasted very good. I've had better in some other places, but for $10 I definitely think this is excellent value.  Service was excellent and I was happy to give them more tips than usual since it's a family run local business. The A/C wasn't working when I was eating, so it was a little hot...but honestly, you're in and out in 30 minutes for the most part.  Hope this place survives in the long run, definitely a place I'll consider the few times I'll be in Pickering!"}
{"text":"Yum ! Street food style Thai. Small menu but very tasty and actually run by Thai's. Yum Pad Thai and fried rice. Four stars because I wish they had more on the menu."}
{"text":"Great authentic food but I had a terrible customer service experience with Hot Mamma Noi herself. When our table asked for the serving cutlery for our plates, she got angry with us because we should have told her this at the same time we asked for water. Apparently she doesn't like waiting on tables even for the necessary stuff. I used to bring tons of friends there but I stopped. She certainly likes chatting up her male patrons, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Patrons are treated as part of the family as  \"Mama\" likes to come out from behind the counter to engage people in conversation. Returning customers are greeted as if they have been coming there for years.food is cooked to order and served piping hot, with a smile. I always get the chicken pad Thai and fresh large spring rolls."}
{"text":"Food was decent for takeout but I felt like this place was overhyped. It's good for Pickering residents where there's little to no options but this is definitely not authentic or unique Thai food."}
{"text":"3-3.5*  I thought this place was pretty good!  I can't say authentic as I haven't been to Thailand, but at least the owner wasn't Viet/Chinese.  That's good enough for me!  ;)    Hot Mama seemed really friendly to a regular who came in for takeout, but also a bit stressed.  I didn't interact with her, but the younger lady - her daughter?  Definitely a family-run business, that's for sure!  As another reviewer mentioned, the menu is very SIMPLE, 1-page.  Lunch/Dinner hours are stated, but I think these are merely their hours of operation as opposed to \"Specials\".  Prices were the same for both meal times.  Also, no apps/drinks, re:  Thai Ice Tea or anything like that, just pop.  I ordered the Masaman Chicken Curry ($9.99) and it was good, definitely had fish sauce and ground up nuts inside, and on the sweeter side.  I'd say that it was fairly mild.  Chunks of potato were too big and there was a lot of them.  They were also undercooked, so slightly crunchy.  Flavours were there, but I would've enjoyed it more if the potatoes were smaller and cooked more.  Could've used another veg like green/red bell pepper slices, bamboo shoots, or basil leaves to brighten it up.  Not a bad choice, if you felt like Thai and were in the area!"}
{"text":"Really great Thai food in Pickering!  In the middle of an industrial area so hard to find it if you're not looking for it, but definitely recommend for take out!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. The food is inconsistent because there are different chefs that work on different days I believe. There have been times I have come and the food has been awesome and other times where it isn't so I am giving it a 3. If it was consistently good it would get a 4."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I've been thoroughly satisfied. The portions are generous, the service is friendly and the food is prepared fast and comes out nice and hot. If you like your food spicy they'll gladly kick up a notch or two for you."}
{"text":"The best thai restaurant in Durham. I living in chatuchak for 1 year and it is as good as bkk thai food. Have to visit."}
{"text":"I ordered last night for take out/pick up. I got the chicken pad thai, spring rolls and beef panang. Everything was so delicious and fresh, that I'd freaking drive all the way here from where ever I'm coming from.. trust me the food is that good. When I ordered over the phone, the lady forgot to tell me the total (no big deal..).. I call back and some lady gave me attitude when I kindly asked her the total.. she said I should of known before or asked before.. I said.. nooo.. This is Your job, Your business.. and as a restaurant, you should be prepared to give the cost.. the lady told me to hold on.. starts yelling at some lady in the back, about not giving me the total and told me $34 dollars and something cents.. I said .. Okay, thank you. And then I went to go grab my food. Her attitude caught me off guard, but frig it.. the food was freaking delicious. I Adore the spring rolls and sauce.. the spring rolls had glass noodles in it and tasted soooooo good and the sauce was light and not over powering. The beef panang was a bit to sweet.. my guy didn't like it at all (spit out in tissue).. lolol, but I enjoyed it, I just wouldn't order it again. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Really good thai food.  My husband and I have been trying all the places in pickering and ajax looking for a good thai place.  This is the best once yet.  We got their spring rolls which were amazing!  They make everything in-house.  I had the pad thai. To have a pad thai that isn't bland or dry was a nice surprise.  It was full of flavor.  My husband had the red curry chicken,  also really good.  Big portions and friendly waiter/owner.  They even give free ice cream during dinner hours.  This is our new favorite thai place.  Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"3.5 star  Eating at Hot Mama Noi's Thai on the Fly does reminds me of my experience of eating Street food in Thailand.  Fresh simple ingredients made with attention and care just like how home cooking suppose to be.   My Pad See Ew requested extra spicy was A-OK. Portion definitely on a smaller size but does have the great complexity of taste of fish sauce, soy sauce and of course chili!  Deco is really simple, just like those restaurants in Thailand that local people visit.  I disappointed Mama a little when I told her version is close but not as good as what I had in Thailand... but definitely more than good enough for a Toronto Thai restaurant in Pickering!"}
