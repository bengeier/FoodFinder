{"text":"Que rico! The food, the staff, the atmosphere are all amazing!   I relished in the guacamole with fresh Tostitos followed by zucchini fritters dipped in adobo mayo. Then I devoured 3 tacos; whole lobster tail, spicy shrimp and beer battered cod. Even though I was full I couldn't resist trying the dessert \"el churro\" and I'm so glad I did. Thank you chefs!  The server was awesome! He made sure to go over the menu as well as events that were coming up at el local loco. Although it was very busy, he was very present and made for a pleasant experience. Thank you Lamar!  The space was beautiful. From the decor, to the lighting, the ambiance was warm and cozy!  I will be going back! Soon!"}
{"text":"Given the great Mexican options in Toronto, this place was just fine.  We started with the Guac and the corn Salad. The Guac was great, but the corn salad was lackluster.  I'm pretty sure they used canned corn, so we probably should have tried the whole corn option.  The Tacos were ok as well. None really blew me away. The ingredients were all fresh, but everything was just missing a little extra kick. We did ask for hot sauce, but still...Meh.  Maybe we have been spoiled by La Carnita, Playa Cabana, El Cabalito and El Catrin over the years. I think next time we feel like Mexican, we will go to one of the other options.   Nice venue, not overcrowded, plenty of space. The service was friendly."}
{"text":"This place has good food, great vibe and awesome staff! I came here with my husband on a Wednesday night and the music was great and everyone seemed like they were having a great time. I came again with my girlfriends and we had a great time again"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!!  Best tacos in Toronto.  Georgio is amazing and runs a great restaurant.  Fun atmosphere, well crafted menu and friendly service.  Quality food and drinks!  Excellent job Georgio and team!!"}
{"text":"good things: the servers were super nice. the food was promising. nice drinks. not so good things: the vibe was kind of straddling that line between passably cool/contemporary and forgettable. and the portion sizes seemed to be inspired by the financial district or distillery district (el local loco is halfway between both) -- i.e., bit too small for the higher price point. if cost is an issue for you (you want to feel full for under $25), their burritos are a much better deal than their tacos."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the carnitas burrito bowl. Flavor of pork was excellent and quantity was sufficient. Service was fine for a table of one."}
{"text":"After 4 visit at Loco, 3 lunches, 1 late night drinks. I will not be returning. I ordered the same meal  each visit and it was never served the same. I ordered the signature drink \"The Smoking Skull\", 3 times that also was never served or tasted the same. The last time was the worst and the bartender was just rude!"}
{"text":"Went to El Local Loco for a dinner with a group of friends on a Saturday night. From start to end had great service from the wait staff and general manager Georgio who made sure we were satisfied with the food and service. Because we had a bigger group we made a reservation ahead of time and had a set menu. We started with pico de Gallo and guac and chips then had a few starters that included corn salad, nachos and fried avocado. For the mains we had a mixture of tacos and ended with the jalapeno brownie. Not only was the food good but portions wise it was definitely enough food to keep everyone satisfied and full. Will come back again and recommend this place for Mexican food in the city if you don't want to spend an arm and a leg at other spots in the city."}
{"text":"Went here for an early dinner tonight before seeing a show.   Service: awesome. Our server, Dane, was accommodating and real. Great dude!  Atmosphere: really nice place. Loved the the decor and music and lighting.   Food: Meh. Not that great.  Chips, guacamole, Pico and queso were ok. Pico could use some spice. Ceviche was pretty decent.  Tacos were pretty bad. Meat was dry and tasted like it was cooked the day before. Had the lobster, pork , and beef cheek tacos. All super super dry and tasteless. Hot sauce saved the day. Literally all three types of meat were sub par."}
{"text":"It's our first time for eating here, I was looking for some restaurants with nice atmosphere around eaton centre and I find it in yelp. It's great for them to offer a free redeem treat, the tomato salsa is literally stunning, which makes us order more later! The tacos are quite awesome as well that they are soft in shell ,diversifying in ingredients and satisfying in scale, it's messy to eat but soooo good! The corn is perfect in texture but a little bit lack of sourness in general. Overall, it is a very satisfying"}
{"text":"So we had such a great experience previously on valentine's day, we thought it was proper to give it another go but this time with the 13 year old.    We started with the full nacho appetizer and the zucchini fritters..both a big hit. Even  the young one commented how fresh the guacamole was!  Mains were 4 tacos ..lobster, beef cheek, lamb and chicken. Excellent again.   13 yr old had a burrito and he loved it.   Desert was the churros sundae. That didn't disappoint! Again easy to tell it was made from scratch. We all left overly full and the bill under 100 ( including 2 beers).   Service was excellent  (Lemar?)  Super helpful and always had an eye on us.   Gotta say this place is really good on all fronts. Well done again!"}
{"text":"Good food, good ambiance, good service. Too loud though. Feels like you are eating at a dance club. Found it challenging to talk with my friend over dinner."}
{"text":"Was offered to sit at the bar and then be transferred to a table when available. I think they forgot about us but our bar tender was friendly and we still had a good time. Tried the cod, lobster and pork tacos and corn; the cod was my favorite, the corn was ok."}
{"text":"I've been to Local Logo twice.  The first time I was there, I loved it - easy 4 stars!  The server was really great and knowledgable.  He suggested the zucchini fritters and they did not disappoint.  The restaurant made me feel in part like I was back in Mexico.  It was a great time.   The second time we went, we ordered the same fritters and they just weren't the same - smaller and overdone.  Everything just seemed to fall a bit flat.    I'll surely be going again as I'm a sucker for Mexican food, but the 3rd time will be the decider on whether I continue to go."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday. Took 1 hour 15 mins to make 3 tacos. Tacos were mediocre and over priced compared to my normal watering holes at Chacho's and Playa Cabana. Won't be returning. Much better options in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great spot, though a bit hard to find. Service and food were great, really tasty. My girlfriend and I both had burritos... Good portions and good flavors. Finished our meal with a gluten free brownie with tequila and line whipped cream, it was delicious. Only downside is the layout; it's a really large space and yet it feels awkward... where we were sitting we constantly had traffic running on either side of us."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times for brunch, and thoroughly enjoyed each visit. The Huevo Ranchero is more of a fusion style and very enjoyable.  The tacos are ok. I ordered the octopus one and it was quite bland. The servers are very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great place for trying different tacos and dishes. Portions are small but delicious. I lvoe their different hot sauces. Cocktails are good as well. In the summer the windows open so it has a patio feel to it."}
{"text":"I went in for dinner on a Wednesday night. I got the pulpo (octopus) and cola de langosta (lobster) tacos, the ceviche de bacalao (cod) and the cherry-licious cocktail (at the price of my manhood).   The food was a mixed bag. I found the tacos tasted fresh, but bland. The seafood was well cooked but under-seasoned, as were the sauces used. The corn tacos they were served on were thick and, again, largely tasteless. The ceviche on the other hand was a revelation. I was already blown away when it was set in front of me - gorgeous plating (picture below).  The flavour exceeded it's visual appeal. The fresh, light cod was immaculately counterbalanced by a thick, rich guacamole with perfect measures of acidity from the lemon juice, heat from the jalape√±os and sweetness from the honey. The tostada it comes on was very crunchy and perfectly salted. Relating the dish is making my mouth water, 10/10. It made the tacos all the more disappointing, however.   The cherry-licious cocktail (recommended by the bartender, I had hoped I looked manly enough to merit a more maturely titled drink, but alas) was very-licious. Sweet, but not overpoweringly so, with light notes of cherry to accent the tequila.  The ambiance was stellar. The Latin music along with the perfect lighting gave the place a unique vibe. It felt like I'd been transported to a mysterious bar somewhere in South America. The service was stellar as well. The host was friendly, and food was served promptly and respectfully with a smile.   On the pricier side, but I felt overall the experience had reasonable value. I would give a full 5 stars, but unfortunately the food was not consistently perfect. I wish I hadn't ordered the tacos, and instead got 2 ceviche! I recommend trying this place at least once if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Totally blown away.  In our party of four, we had a vegan and two vegetarians so not easy to walk away with everyone satisfied but we all (including our foody) was smoked by how great everything was. Food was awesome!!! Had a smoking (it actually smokes) tequila drink in a skull (can't remember the name) worth a trip just for that. Best Churros I've EVER had!!! Decor is great, lots to look at but not overdone. It has a very warm and romantic atmosphere. Music was great and at that perfect volume where you can enjoy it and still have a conversation without feeling like you're in a nightclub screaming over speakers. Very refreshing."}
{"text":"This place was not our favorite Toronto eatery. It was way over priced for very little food. The only thing we liked was the ceviche. Everything else was sub par! Also, this could be because everyone in my party is Mexican..... the \"queso\" was possibly the worst thing we've had in Toronto. Sorry, Loco. We were not fans."}
{"text":"Great food, good ambiance and service. They could consider toning down the festive music though.... we are trying to digest food! Spicy shrimp tacos are amazing! Margueritas, yum!"}
{"text":"First impression, the staff are inviting. My waiter has a Spanish accent so it must be good right?. I decided to listen to the waiters recommendations. The Loco, margarita made with Trombo tequila is amazing despite the fact I hate tequila.  One moment please, waiting for my taco, tortilla chips and fried avocado dish..... Verdict ....Taco, made with soft corn tortilla. The kind of tortilla where you can taste the corn and not just a bland floury thing. Tasty zucchini fritters with small amount of veggies placed inside. Add the hot sauce and beautiful.  The cheese soup is a medley of fresh veggies and chunks of Mexican cheese. Mild flavours but wonderful. Seems healthy despite the chunks of cheese. Fried avocado halves. Breaded perfectly. Served warm. Loved them Pico de gallo, can't go wrong. It was great as well This place is situated in the location of the old Jamie Kennedy Wine Bar. You can't beat JK's but this is close For those of you who have complained about the portion size, maybe you should get the hint."}
{"text":"We went in after a cold night at the distillery,  and stopped by for some snacks.  Service was pretty fast and the guy in charge of us was very prompt and always got our nachos refilled!   we had guacamole and their wild corn salad which was really interesting as it had cheese bits in it with other tender things. I don't like salad but I'll get this anytime!  The guacamole was specially yummy as our table agreed,  it has a good avocado to tomato ratio and had a kick to it, not boring at all. A friend got the burrito - massive burrito, and very worth the price he paid.  And got the dynamite hot sauce with it- we tried it too, it was mild then suddenly spicy and got even more spicy! Decor wise the place was filled with whimsical paintings on the wall,  and the same theme was on the table cards. The bar is something else, pretty satisfying to see all the drinks so neatly lined, will definitely try here for drinks next time!"}
{"text":"Has potential. Nice space. Decent tacos. Menu seems a bit overpriced. The fish portions in the Ceviche was laughable, basically about 8 small pieces of fish sprinkled over a tortilla & guac platter. I recommend renaming that dish, cause there might be a few bits of ceviche on it but it ain't ceviche. If Loco tweaks pricing and portions it will get my reco."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food outside Mexico!  This stuff is fresh, delicious, gourmet and presentation is masterchef-like.  awesome - have been dying for something like this to open up in TO... love love love the food, tacos and cocktails were 5 star, as was everything else.  Lamar, our server, was very kind and fun to chat with!"}
{"text":"A brand new restaurant that was open one and half month ago. I came in on a Sunday for lunch.   Pros: tasty brunches with Mexican touch, affordable pricing (around 12-17), spacious and each to accommodate bigger groups; they do take reservations even on weekends; relatively quiet so easy to talk Cons: not yet noticed   Food quality: I do like the Mexican touch on traditional egg Benedict  (I ordered the lobster one and it tastes good! )"}
{"text":"It was good, 3.5 stars. I got the pico and chips thanks to the yelp check-in. Chips were good, pico was just okay. I also got two different margaritas, both very good. I ordered the carnitas burrito for dinner and it was delicious. Very flavorful and filling--I couldn't finish the whole thing so took the leftovers home. I will say it needed to be hotter (stove wise) as it was just lukewarm. My wife got the beef cheek burrito bowl and it was good, but could've been more flavorful. Again generous portion as she had leftovers too. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and had moderate hopes for this place. They really delivered on the service and friendliness. We felt really well take care of. From the moment we stepped in we were greeted by the owner, and then attentively taken care of by our waiter. This was wonderful and appreciated. And the vibe of the place was fantastic, and the beer and appetizers were very reasonably priced. The chips and guac were quite good and I appreciated that they brought the chips out in small quantities (refillable) to minimize waste. The food however, was disappointing. We ordered the beef cheek and pork tacos and they were unreasonably bland. There was no depth of flavor to the meat. And corn salad wasn't grilled corn and again lacked a depth of flavor. We barely finished our food and left unsatisfied. Now if they could only elevate the food the same level as the service, vibe and value, this place would be amazing."}
{"text":"YUM!! This will be a place I bring people for sure.   My friends and I celebrated our annual Christmas dinner here and it was quite impressive! We had a large group (about 25 people) and booked about 2 weeks in advance. The restaurant did such an amazing job of organizing our dinner and made sure we had a server that was able to handle such a large group. When we arrived, the manager even came to introduce himself and made sure that we were settled in ok. They were very friendly!   They offered us a prefixed menu for $37 that included chips and guac/salsa to share, an appetizer of choice, a main of choice and dessert of choice. The food surprisingly arrived at a reasonable amount of time considering the number of people we had and it was soooo good!! Again, they did an amazing job of catering to our large group.   Their guacamole was really good! The avocados were perfectly ripe and had the right amount of seasoning - could not stop eating it!   My husband and I made sure to order different things so that we could try it all! We had the fried avocado and shrimp ceviche as the appetizer. You can tell right away how fresh the ingredients were and all the flavours combined so well together!   Next we ordered the lamb and lobster tacos ...the lobster tacos were my fave! They were not shy with the lobster at all! I had so much in each bite, it was amazing!   For dessert we ordered the jalape√±o brownie and churros. The brownie didn't have much of a kick as I expected but it was still very soft, moist and chocolatey! My fave were the churros...SO.GOOD.  The hot churros with the ice cream.....to die for!"}
{"text":"It was our first time going so we can't make a fair assessment just yet. Good news is that we are definitely going back! The service was a little lacking but the poor was very good. Despite it being a Friday night and the restaurant being packed, we got our food fairly quickly. Simple food options... but yummy!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place because the service was so good, but the tacos just didn't cut it for me. We had the spicy shrimp ($7), chicken ($6) and the beer battered fish ($6). The best was the fish in my opinion, but even that was OK. The star of the show was the Mexican corn with the delicious crema and all the fixings.   On the plus side, the servers were VERY friendly. I think they could tell we were a bit disappointed with our meal and they offered us a free dessert on the house. We didn't take it but it was a nice gesture.   Price: 3/5 Food: 3/5 Service: 6/5"}
{"text":"Been here twice now, loved the guac, the burritos, the tostada, tried both the reg and the pricier margaritas, they were ok. I've had better but overall really nice cool place to enjoy some nice Mexican food."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! It exceeded our expectations. Everything we ordered was incredible. We started off with guac, delicious. Then we ordered this big nacho which we split in half (I forget name of) SO GOOD. Now on to the best part: the tacos. My boyfriend ordered 3 and I ordered 2. He had octopus as one of his! I had chicken and lamb and a bite of his octopus one. OH MY GOSH! The flavour was amazing. You can tell that whoever came up with the menu put a lot of time and thought into what ingredients each taco had. Then we finished off with sharing the churro dessert. My boyfriend has a nut allergy so we asked for no nuts on it and it was no problem! DELICIOUS! Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"I am surprised they are not busier on Valentine's Day! They had this amazing combo for 2 for $89 which included two margarita, a trio tortilla dip with queso, guacamole and salsa, a shrimp ceviche, corn salad, two pollo taco and two carnitas taco, a deconstructed burrito and a churro ice cream for dessert. It was absolutely delicious and way too much food for two (lunch for tomorrow anyone?)  Everything was very well flavoured and delicious so really no complaints on that or the service. Only thing, the place is WAY TOO DARK to take pictures. Even too dark to even see what I was eating clearly. Hopefully they lighten things up. Will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican spot. 3.5 stars. Ample seating, tasty food and super-friendly service. Really like that the tacos are √† la carte so you can mix & match & share with a friend.   We started with the CHORIZO CON QUESO which was smaller than expected (about the size of my hubby's palm).  Served with fresh, crunchy tortilla chips. The chorizo comes in chunks not ground, as in other restaurants, and needed a bit of salt. Was ok but prob wouldn't order again.  For mains we shared 1 of each of the following tacos (cut each in half): CARNITAS (pork shoulder) was DELICIOUS with little mini chichorones which gave a satisfying crunch in the middle of the tender pulled meat; CACHETE (beef cheek) again, well seasoned and perfectly tender with crispy onion straws for contrasting texture; CAMAR√ìN PICANTE (spicy shrimp) was light and citrusy with a squeeze of lime, a nice break from the heavier meat tacos though the shrimp was unsurprisingly overcooked; and the BARBACOA (lamb) which had a rich, gamey, fatty flavour, exactly as you would expect; finally the PESCADO BORRACHO (beer battered cod) which came out hot and crispy but nothing special (it was my first fish taco ever so not sure if it was mediocre or if fish tacos just aren't my thing).  Wish we had room for dessert. The CHURRO SUNDAY with candied peanuts & dulche de leche sounds amazing. Ah well, good reason to come back a 2nd time."}
{"text":"We ordered the guac & chips and the crispy avocado for our appetizer and both were delicious. I had the zucchini tacos (I'm vegetarian) and all my meat loving friends agreed it is their favorite too! The waiter was really nice and the whole place is super trendy and cute!"}
{"text":"Yummm yum yum yum yum. Visited Toronto from southern california, 20 miles from the border, and I can confirm that this place has some delicious, filling, authentic Mexican food. Super fun atmosphere, too!"}
{"text":"Food was great but the service was abysmal. We wait 2-3 minutes and no one acknowledged us. We finally sat down ourselves and were ignored for a long time. This seems unbelievable but it may have been a half hour before we were able to order. They were severely understaffed the the wait staff was even cleaning tables instead of serving us. Finally either a manager or the owner took our order and he was great. We got free guacamole and queso because of our wait. Great food but a frustrating experience."}
{"text":"Randomly chose this place to eat on a Saturday night as my friend and I were wandering around this neighbourhood.  We started off with guacamole while I had the braised beef rib plate for my main while my friend had a pork burrito bowl.  The chips were servicebale (they weren't stale but they were actually kind of cold to the touch which was strange) but the guacamole was flavoured nicely with garlic, lime, cilantro.  My friend said his burrito bowl was very mediocre and uninteresting but my braised beef rib plate was fantastic.  It was beautifully meaty and tender to the point where the meat was falling off the bone.  I left feeling full and satisfied.  Our server was great but since the music was so loud and blaring, I found it difficult to hear anything that she said to us.  And my friend and I couldn't hold a conversation since we couldn't hear each other.  Still, that braised beef rib plate was so good that I'm willing to give this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, great music and ambiance. The food was average.. pretty pricey for what you get. My bf and I paid $80 for 4 tacos, calamari and 2 drinks. The tacos were good (beef cheek and shrimp), very small; we were still hungry after. Calamari sauce was great; spicy mayo and a honey garlic type sauce, but the calamari was cut a little too thin. Our server, I think his name was Allan, wasn't the greatest. I ordered a gin and tonic; their tonic water was so flat it changed the taste of the drink, so instead I ordered a beer and gave back my gin and tonic. He said that the beer would be on the house, which was great service recovery, but on the bill he still charged me for the gin and tonic which was the same price. Lol. So in the end that cancelled out the service recovery. I had 1/3 of my taco left on my plate, he asked if he could take it away.. I said I'd finish the last bite, and he stood there waiting for me to finish. Nothing too crazy, but it's one of my pet peeves! And to top it off, despite the not so great service, when we paid for the bill he didn't even say a simple \"thank you\". Over all, if you get this type of service and are craving tacos, I'd recommend burrito boys or a walk in joint in Kensington market. Won't be returning unfortunately unless if I'm just grabbing a drink!"}
{"text":"Great place for a big group, lots of space. The margaritas were good, they had happy hour from 4-6pm (or maybe it was 3-6pm) which made margaritas $7, definitely good value there.  I had the chicken, carnitas and chorizo tacos. They were decent, but not memorable. I would go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"There are so many restaurants to choose from in Toronto and we chose this one randomly. We are so glad we did! I had the chicken burrito bowl and he had the burrito. Both were incredible. Fresh ingredients, good flavor and the hot sauces were amazing. I really wish they sold them separately.  We paid more for drinks than we did for food which is fine. Drinks were good as well. Service was great and we had no wait to sit or eat. Some of the best Mexican food we've ever had!"}
{"text":"The dearth of even a half decent mexican food spot continues in Toronto.  The space is large and has a certain character which might and might not appeal to you. We were a larger group so had made reservations beforehand. We were seated promptly. The service is spot on so kudos for that. Now for the main attraction the food. I had the guacamole and chips as a starter followed by the beef rib as the main. Others in the party ordered a variety of items including tacos and burrito/buritto bowls. The starter was decent as the guacamole giving a fresh feel. Now the things started to falter the burrito was just bad. I am talking chipotle is better level bad. I can't justify paying twice as much for a product half as good.  The beef rib had a pungent finish which was off putting not to mention the lingering salt. The meat was tender which is great. Now when one factors in the price I would say 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"First time here. Was expecting some good food and a great time. Found the great time because I was with great friends. Had a variety of foods. Zucchini fritters were awesome. Definitely have those. Tacos were good. The shrimp tacos were the best between the chicken and beef. Nothing is really too spicy. The most unfortunate thing was the service. Our server was chatty and informative but with his fellow staff mates and not us. Perhaps if we had posted something on Facebook or Instagram he would payed more attention to us."}
{"text":"eating the burrito right now and I feel absolutely no need to soil my pants!  great service and wonderful music make this spot one of the best brown-free Mexican spots around toronto"}
{"text":"It was a GREAT experience here.  I had so much fun with my friends. LOCO LOCO lol Do you know what it means? It means CRAZYYYYYY!   AMBIANCE (4.5 stars) The ambiance was great and beautiful.  I love the colorful Mexican style decor.  However, the place was quite LOUD.  There was Spanish or Latin music played on almost the entire time.  I was ok with it though. The best shot was there was a Live Latin Music playing by two guitarists at the same time. It was incredible.  I really enjoyed it.   The place was also DARK inside at night which made it difficult to read their menus and take clear pictures of their food!  At least, we got a good spot just next to the big window at the front of the restaurant. It was kind of like our own section. We often walked around the table and talked as loud as we could!     This place was SPACIOUS.  There was enough space in the middle of the dining room which was good for dancing.  It's perfect for groups and corporate events.  The evening we were there, there was also a small corporate event. They were busy with the event when we got there.  However, the staff was very attentive and helpful.  There was 3-4 staff that came to the door to greet us and try to get us a table.  It was good that we already made a reservation.  It's good if you always think of making a reservation right!?   SERVICE (5 stars) I could say that the biggest reason that will get me come back here again is the SERVICE.  Because our server was beyond NICE and ATTENTIVE.  He was very patient with us.  He came to greet us and asked us many times if we were ready to order. We spent a lot of time chitchating and taking pictures around the restaurant. He was clam and tried to drop by regularly to check if we needed anything else.  He totally was a good seller.  We had to order something every time he came by...The best shot was that he suggested my husband have a drink when he came to pick me up. He spent only 5 minutes, and he sold two shots of tequila which was $30!  I don't think you guys want to know how much my friend spent on his drinks. Right!? @Edmund.   I need to say that we were lucky, I was fortunate to experience excellent service here.  Not only from our waiter but all staff I met that night they were helpful and friendly.  I even got a picture taken with a bartender.  He just showed up with a big smile when my friend was taking a picture for me.  Haha! I know it was hilarious!   FOOD (3 stars) The downfall of this place for me would be the food. The portions ran small.  It was a bit pricey if you compare to many Mexican restaurants in downtown.  However, they might want to represent how authentic they are which I have no idea but I do love the atmosphere and service here.     We were a group of 6 people (my husband was the 6th, he didn't eat though).  We ordered few appetizers and some main dishes for sharing such as Shrimp Ceviche \"Ceviche De Cameron\" zucchini fritters \"Fritura De Calabac√≠n\" Octopus tacos \"Pulpo Taco.\" Chicken Burrito Bowl \"Pollo Burrito.\" We had churros Sundae \"Churros Helado\" as a dessert. My friend loves it but it was too sweet in my opinion.  My FAVE dish tonight was \"ZUCCHINI FRITTERS!\".  It's a MUST!   DRINKS (4 stars) We all had our own drink.  I got Loco Margarita (Tequila Tromba Blanco mixed with Lime juice and Agave syrup).  It was too bitter for me, but someone might like it.   My friend @Edmund ordered a very interesting, \"SMOKING SKULL\" (aged tequila infused with hickory & mesquite).  He couldn't resist our server's charm lol.  If you like TEQUILA, this place is really for you!  They have many brands of tequila for you to choose.     PRICE $$-$$$   OVERALL (4 stars) The great thing here was service and ambiance.  Thumb up for the waiter named \"PRINCE.\""}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan - I would give this place a 2.5. I just expect more from a taco spot.   Drinks: they have a selection of margaritas ranging from $10-$15 but no pitcher. However they do offer sangria pitchers and something called a smoking skull which is a Mezcal sharing drink.   Food: mediocre for the price in my opinion. They have about a dozen taco selections of which I tried the lamb ($8) - too much topping, you couldn't taste the lamb flavours, octopus - bland, small pieces of octopus ($8), beef cheek ($7) - this was actually my fav, lots of flavour. We also ordered the beef cheek burrito bowl which was also really nice and topped with a healthy portion of guac.   For apps we ordered the shrimp ceviche which was quite nice, the guac and chips and the pico de gallo (this was free with Yelp check in), some good flavours in all three dishes but nothing that sticks with me.   I find this to be more of a touristy spot, and a spot for larger groups to swing by after games and concerts. It fits right in with the Esplanade restaurants."}
{"text":"Quality has gone way, way down in the past couple months. The service: first they got the reservation wrong and sat us, three people, way in the back on a 6-person table where we had a wonderful view of the back end of the kitchen. The waitress took 20 minutes just to get our drink order. And then the appetiser came, the 3-dip chips, and THEN came our drink. The chicken tacos, once delicious, are now just awful. The meat tastes like and has the consistency of canned flaked chicken. Everything was over-spiced, the shrimp tacos smothered by hot sauce.  A real pity."}
{"text":"Worst meal I ate in Toronto.  The city has great food but this place is not worth going to... The waitress messed up  my husbands order, forget our chips and salsa until after the main course arrived at our table.  Additionally the drinks were so weak I doubt they had an alcohol in them.  Pass on this place if you are in Toronto."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place to eat so we decided to try this Mexican place out. So glad we picked this place! Hands down, the best burrito bowl I've ever had. I ordered the Chorizo Burrito Bowl ($15) and the flavours were amazing! Their hot sauce is seriously the best hot sauce I have ever had, it's a combination of a sweet/spicy mix. Added on top of my bowl, and the flavours were 10/10. If you check-in on Yelp as well, you get free chips with pico de gallo on the side (free chips refills). The servers were really nice and attentive, always refilling our waters. Definitely recommend this place, and I'm sure to come back for their burrito bowls and hot sauce."}
{"text":"Best tacos and guacamole I have ever had! Was hard to find this place but the service is super and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I used to drive relatively far to the west part of the town for good tacos, but not any more. Yay."}
{"text":"The portions are a bit small for the price so you would have to order an app and two tacos to be full.  The tacos were okay. The meat was a little dry and didn't taste anything special. No burst of flavor, no juicy-ness from the meat or vegetables or sauces.   The corn salad was tasty and really made up for the lack of flavour in the tacos. Tasted like corn, feta crema, with some salsa.   The service was a little slow but I think they were lacking some servers that night - so it's forgivable."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, very fresh and delicious! The server was great and very attentive. Atmosphere was a little dark, but very funky and fun. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this restaurant four stars one day - right now it's at a 3.5. Hubby and I dined here on Valentine's Day and it seemed busier than usual (a good thing!).. We live in the neighbourhood and are always excited to try out new restaurants - this location has been through a few \"new\" openings and closures so I wish El Local Loco luck! I hope management reads the constructive reviews here to better those chances.  Space - great Latin music, made me want to keep dancing in my seat, nice layout, artwork, tables, plates etc. We were thinking getting a live band/mariachi band on some nights would be awesome for the space.   Drinks - margarita was awesome, hubby had one of the cervezas and it was great  Food - prices - more expensive than the best taco joints in the city (not impressive), portions are about the same, I echo the need for more fish in the ceviche!  Food - the good: the fish ceviche was awesome, the guac was good, the beef cheek taco was yumo and the churro dessert is every donut-lovers dream.   Food - the bad: the crema they put on some of their tacos was turning bad and they were still serving it (had a definite smell and taste...). I'm hoping this changes as the restaurant becomes more popular as my guess is that it's a vat of crema in their fridge that just needs to be used up faster.  The chorizo in the chorizo taco is giant cold chunks of sausage and not ground up and warm like at other taco joints in the city. In general, it seemed like everything we ordered was a mix of tortilla (fried/soft), meat/fish, guac - so that it wasn't as complex and multidimensional as Latin food can be, which other taco joints in the city have gotten right. The menu/ingredients are thus worth considering as, while the guac is good, lathering it on everything is playing it too safe.    Customer service - good - management took the tacos with the crema away and apologized.  Overall, I definitely want to return in the near future and hope that some changes will have been implemented by then - lots of potential here so don't waste it!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and starters they all had a little kick to them which I loved. Server was attentive and it was a good atmosphere. Will definitely go back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"We waited for 40 minutes to get the appetisers and then another 25 minutes to get our tacos, we had to change our drink order 3 times because they were out of beers. When we complained to the manager, he offered us 15% discount. When the bill came, he changed it to 10%. When we reminded him of the 15%, he said he'll give it to us so that we \"stop bitching\". He thought we didn't hear him and when we confronted him, he walked away and didnt return until we left. .... overall a very bad experience. Will not visit again and would not recommend."}
{"text":"I had seen El Local Loco pop up on my Yelp feed, and I was curious. So when my friend suggested it for dinner, I couldn't say no! Just like I couldn't say no to the second Margarita!  It's great! Someone else here said, it's hard to pick \"a favourite Mexican joint\" in the city, since there are so many - I totally agree. However, it's not common of a \"refined\" Mexican restaurant to be balance in all aspects (service, food, price). Although I typically prefer my \"hole-in-the-wall\" Mexican meals, El Local Loco was a good change. I had their short rib special, which was so tender, and delicious! My friends had burritos/bowls and they were really good (I snuck in a couple bites!)   They have some house made hot sauce - definitely give them a try. Not insanely spicy, but adds a nice kick to the meal if you are up for it.   So overall: good food, good service, fair priced (given the location) - definitely not just another Mexican cocktail bar."}
{"text":"My husband and I walked into this place on a Monday night because of their margarita special. The service was excellent - out server was incredibly polite, attentive, and was able to explain the menu very well.  The ambience is romantic, with dim lighting and a few candles. The music is all spanish, which is a nice reprieve from the usual top 40.  We shared the corn, then each had one taco and a burrito. The portions are appropriate and presentation is quite nice. At the end of the night, we split a churro sundae. Overall, this is a great authentic Mexican restaurant in the St. Lawrence area that will give nearby El Catrin a run for their money."}
{"text":"One star for the venue, nice and clean.  Service was extremely slow, food was cold and bland, and the prices are ridiculously high.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. I've enjoyed the ambiance and octopus taco. The fried Avocado was interesting. I've also ordered the cod ceviche and find it a bit sour. Overall, a good new restaurant for Mexican tapas!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner and catch up with old friends. We live down the street and had been hoping to check it out since it opened just a few weeks back, and since our friends love Mexican food we thought it'd be a good option. Turns out it was a great choice!!   It's got a really cool vibe, without being too trendy or hip. It was busy on a Saturday night, but not so much so that you couldn't enjoy yourself or have a conversation.  As for the food? It was delicious. Tacos are single serving, so we all tried a bunch of different options. There were definitely some stand outs (chicken was a hit all around and I was a big fan of the fish). I also tried one of there margaritas. It was delicious, though I would have liked it to have been a little bit larger (and unfortunately it doesn't look like they do pitchers). They also had a really fancy cocktail involving smoke and dry ice that was super expensive (so we didn't try it) but a nearby table had ordered it and it looked mighty impressive.   We also ordered chips and guacamole, which we're all big fans of. At first they only brought out a very small amount of chips and I was worried how 4 people would share so few, but they kept bringing out more as we ate, so that didn't  end up being a problem.  We also tried both the desserts. I found the brownie underwhelming but the churro was delicious!  The price wasn't too unreasonable for a downtown Toronto restaurant. There are probably other Mexican places that are a bit cheaper for the same quality food, but the price was on-par with the area.  I'd definitely come back for a fun night out with friends."}
{"text":"Lovely place, delicious food, fun ambiance, good Latin music, and nice decor. The service was good, nice server as well. Pricing is fair. The food was very fresh. They have a good guacamole and ceviche. We will visit again."}
{"text":"My first visit to El Local Loco was a pleasant experience. I was walking around downtown around St. Lawrence Market looking for a place to eat and just happened to stumble upon this restaurant! I naturally love tacos, so I thought why not?   Upon entering, you'll see that El Local Loco is very spacious. It's got some hipster decor on the walls and a casual atmosphere to it. Everyone I interacted with inside (hostess, servers) were all helpful, friendly, and customer-oriented. The menu has a wide variety of unique mexican appetizers, taco flavours, burritos/burrito bowls, and dessert! They've also got several different types of cocktails and tequila on their drink menu, because what better to mix your tacos with... Amirite? Some drinks can get pretty pricey though. Anyway, I've tried the chips with guacamole, pico de gallo (this is free if you check-in on Yelp!), carnitas taco, and pollo taco - and they're all pretty good. I would definitely recommend any of these choices if you're having trouble choosing.  Since I had a great first time here, I actually decided to come again for my birthday party! The employees were really accomodating for my group of ~18 people that kept changing in numbers every few days. El Local Loco is a terrific place for large groups because of the casual atmosphere, wide selection of food and drinks, and great service. It's also probably one of the very few Mexican restaurants in downtown Toronto that accomodate for events like this, so I appreciated that very much.   All in all, had a wonderful time during both my visits and I certainly wouldn't be against coming back again for a third time. I'll be trying a burrito bowl for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Good food and service but way too expensive for the size of their portions. Also no wifi. It's 2017 come on."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Friday night with my boyfriend and the restaurant was pretty empty. Waiter came and took our order right away - after that he never came back. It was unfortunate since the food was great and we were anxious to order more. But the waiter was hopeless and very unattentive - lost and absent minded. I hope the management realizes that their business is single handedly being degraded by the service, not the quality of the food."}
{"text":"First time in Toronto, and let me tell you...this place was a total hit. Adam our server/bartender was the most personable, friendly and attentive waiter I've had in a very long time. We were nervous about choosing a random location, since we were relying heavily on yelp and trip advisor for recommendations, but el local Loco did not disappoint. In fact it exceeded our expectations. The tacos were phenomenal. Try the chorizo and carnitas, they were amazing. The pico de Gallo was fresh and hit the spot. As a margarita connoisseur I was pleasantly surprised and extremely satisfied with Adam's  PERFECT and classic margarita. This man knows what he is doing!!! Every single employee was kind friendly and had great recommendations. Shout out to Mike who was attentive and friendly and shout out to Levi who recommended places in the area for us this weekend. I WILL be returning to el Loco. I would give this place six stars if I could!!!"}
{"text":"Came on an early Sunday afternoon for late breakfast lol. Ended up ordering from their regular menu because the brunch menu is not very vegetarian or vegan friendly.  Food- 4/5. All the ingredients taste and look super fresh! Especially the guac! The seafood is also very fresh. Main complaint is portion size - definitely tapas style here. The tacos are super small (a dude probably needs at least 4-5 tacos to sort of fill up). Even the guac + chips came as a super small portion size. I recommend the whole corn - sadly not vegan due to the cheese and sauce, which are indispensable for the taste. Tbh Mexican food in general doesn't seem very accommodating for vegans and ELL is no exception. I ordered the cod ceviche app ($11?) as my main and it was bigger than a taco, but resembled one in presentation and ingredients. The cod was quite fresh and I recommend ordering this over getting a bunch of meat or seafood tacos from an economical standpoint.  Value- 3/5. More expensive than cheaper, hole-in-the-wall taco places like Seven Lives or Wilbur Mexicana, but ok given the convenient location downtown and nice venue. Also it might be one of the only nicer Mexican restaurants in the downtown east area. The cheapest taco (vegetarian) = $4. Expect to drop $15-20 here per person if eating frugally but still ordering apps in addition to entree.  Venue- 5/5. Dark for the most part, but seats by the big windows in the front get a lot of natural lighting, so good for brunch. Booth and table seats are available in this 1-storey large space and there is plenty of space between tables. The decorations are also very dazzling and flavorful. Spanish music was playing in background the entire time, but wasn't deafening like at La Carnita. I love the massive U shaped bar in the middle of restaurant - I see a lot of promise for ELL to become a nighttime destination. I vow to come back again on an evening just for the bar experience :P  Service- 4/5. Fast, friendly, and constant. Our waters were refilled promptly and server came to check on us a few times. But to be fair there weren't a lot of customers here this afternoon at all, so easy crowd to manage. Lost a star for an experience I learned from a friend - in the evenings apparently ELL gets a little more snobby/exclusive by delaying entry, perhaps to try to establish a more nightlife kind of vibe. As a result, friend and his group had a hard time getting seats despite a relatively empty venue.  Advice: make an online reservation if you plan to come in the evenings."}
{"text":"Visited this place recently and got carnitas and pollo tacos! They were really good and the beer was great as well! I really loved the deco of this place, really cozy!!"}
{"text":"I like this place, its lots of fun and a guaranteed good time. The mixed drinks are phenomenal (albeit a bit light on the alcohol side).  Price/quantity wise, El Local Loco is on leaning towards pricier, with an order of 6 tacos, 2 types of dips and 2 drinks coming close to $100, exactly enough to feed 2.   Dips and guac are yummy but portions quite small (think heaping 3 tbsp) and tacos were on the saltier side. What really disappointed us was that both our taco orders (carnitas and lamb) tasted nearly identical, which according to my bf who's a huge latino food fanatic, should not have been the case.   Overall, I wouldn't mad to come back but its just like the star rating says: A-OK"}
{"text":"Great food but terribly slow service. It took us 45mins and a couple of reminders to the waiter to get our bill.   In terms of food, my favourite item on the menu was the zucchini tacos. I would have liked to try the guacamole but the server forgot to bring it out.   Overall, I would definitely try the restaurant again for the food. The service needs improvement."}
{"text":"Great tacos, weird service, very high prices for the quantity of food but the lamb tacos are SO WORTH IT. You probably need to order 2 or 3 in order to feel full though."}
{"text":"Staff was extremely pleasant, food was great and the Grande Margarita was fantastic. Burritos are huge and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food and great ambiance!  Came here to eat after the Raptor's game today as it was a quick walk from ACC.  Was our first time visiting this restaurant and we were very impressed.  Decor is really nice and the venue is very spacious.  I had the Grande Margarita which was quite flavourful.  To start we had the three salsa combo (guacamole, pico de gallo and chorizo queso).  The pico de gallo was so fresh, as was the guacamole.  The chorizo queso was ok.  For dinner I had the beef cheek, carnita and chorizo tacos.  The carnita was dry, which was disappointing but the beef cheek more than made up for it.  It was so tender and juicy.  The chorizo was different but good.  It was actual chunks of sausage with fried potato.  My husband had the fish and lamb tacos, both of which were also good.  My kids had the burrito bowls which were fairly big in size.  To cap off the night we had the churro sundae.  Wow!  The combination of the warm churro and cold vanilla ice cream was to die for. Overall, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"In the heart of the St Lawrence Market, El Local Loco is a relatively new Mexican restaurant that's serving up some good Mexican food.  Ambiance is spacious and busy, with colorful murals exhibiting Mexican culture all over the restaurant.  Fridays and Saturdays are the busy days and it can get quite loud here.  Coming here with a group of 4 that later turned into 6, we were seated right by their window which fully opens up as a door.   Our servers was courteous however overall service was a bit slow.  They've got a great list of drinks especially for margaritas and tequilas.  For food they're known for their tacos and burritos.  I've been to a lot of Mexican restaurants, this place is on the pricier side, however they've got good options. Service is friendly, however not the most efficient.  Here's the breakdown of what was ordered: Zucchini fritters  Fried Calamari- Lovely presentation, great sauce on the side that helped enhance the dish. Grande Margarita - Not Bad, I've seen bigger glasses... Pork burrito - this was HUGE! i mean it looked intimidating :)  Overall Food: 3.5/5 Service: 2.5/5 Ambiance: 4/5"}
{"text":"It's more of a 3.5 for me, but I will round up in this case.  A group of my friends (plus 2 kids) came here for brunch after hearing a lot about it from various people and seeing their yummy food on IG.  It's a pretty big space inside that can definitely hold large parties. The bar is in the middle with plenty of seating and the back has booths while the front are tables (short and high).  The vibe here is relaxed fun, but I can imagine in the evening when the bar gets busy that it is a whole lot of fun. Can't wait to come back for the late night experience.    For food we ordered a whole bunch of items to share (note - while the menu says the dishes are shareable ask the server about portion sizes for some - some are more share than others).  We had: -  the corn salad (a big enough portion to share with 3/4 people).  It had tortilla strips on top so provided a nice crunch to the sweetness of the corn and the acidity of the citrus in the dish. - fish tacos (the order only comes as 1 taco, so clearly you need to order more to share - this is where you need to ask).  The fish was nice and crunchy but I would definitely recommend putting their hot sauce on it to give it a kick - they have 3 - a mild, a hot and one that's more on the sweet/hot side.   - grilled lobster tail benny - grilled lobster on a english muffin with hollandaise sauce and a poached egg.  I thought the lobster was a tad bit overcooked and the sauce a bit bland, but the dish perked up nicely when I added the hot sauce.  It comes with hash which were nice and crispy and had lovely seasoning on them.  I did enjoy the potatoes more than the lobster I think...lol - huevos rancheros  - my friend ordered this and loved it.  I didn't try it myself so I can't say but she did clean up her plate if that's any indication. - zucchini fritters - deep fried in all sorts of goodness - definitely order a few of these for the table - deep fried avocado - literally an avocado cut in half and fried up - up!  But add some lime juice or hot sauce   - lamb burrito - all sorts of yummy and the perfect size for one person.  But again I think it needed some hot sauce to kick it up.  Overall a great meal, maybe I just like my food spicier but that's my preference and the great thing is that there are a variety of hot sauces so you can play with flavour.  Oh and the Tequila Caesar....yeah get it.  It's a nice subtle hint of tequila without punching you in the face kinda tequila.  Great way to start brunch.  The service was great - we never felt rushed even though we took our time after the meal to sit and talk and drink coffee/tea.  They also have a few highchairs available so brunch is definitely a kid friendly place.  This is why I upped to 4 stars overall, I felt the food was more 3.5, but I'm good with 4 stars for the overall experience."}
{"text":"We came here on Cinco De Mayo, boy was that a mistake. I had booked a reservation and as soon as we arrived they told us that they \"didn't do reservations\" (I had been here before, yes they do take reservations). We were seated and ordered our drinks, which took forever to come out, and the server told us to hold on that we cannot order our food yet. After about 45 mins we wanted to order and were still unable to. The server brought us 1 tamale to share among 6 girls, but still didn't let us order. It turns out \"the kitchen had walked out\" so they were really backed up and weren't taking food orders for that reason. Did I mention it was Cinco De Mayo at a Mexican restaurant? Safe to say I'm never going back there again, and I do not recommend anyone to go here. The fact that the kitchen walked out makes you question what goes on back there. Worst dining experience of my life, if I could give this 0.01 stars I would (and the 0.01 would only be for the free tamale). El Catrin and El Caballito are the best Mexican restaurants in Toronto, I also hear Wilbur Mexicana is good too but I have yet to try it."}
{"text":"The ambience of this restaurant was great, with the gorgeous bar and decor. The music was playing pretty loud, so I felt as if I had to shout to be heard even though there were not that many people there. There was a lot of different types of mexican food to choose from, from tacos to burrito bowls. We got the guacamole and chips, and the guacamole was addicting! They kept bringing out the chips when we finished with our bowl which was nice. I ordered the chicken burrito bowl, and it was good, but it was pretty bland overall and smaller than expected. If I came again, I would try something different like the tacos just to give it another chance!"}
{"text":"just tried this new Mexican restaurant. it's brand new so the staff is not fully knowledgeable of the menu, but overall the staff is friendly. food tasted great! we started with guacamole and ceviche, both excellent. then had a variety of Tacos. the price is a little high but the food was good. be sure to try the Margarita for two, it was excellent!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends on a whim. There's a great modern Mexican atmosphere though the same background music playing became stale. The service was subpar, we waited a good 45 minutes before we even gave our order. The food itself though was amazing. There was a separate brunch menu we could order from since we went for lunch. I ordered the huevos rancheros and tried all three hot sauces they offered (all of which were fantastic). Definitely recommend going here at a less busy time though."}
{"text":"Good spot, tasty little tacos (but I do mean little), great service, relatively short wait times.  We were there on a weekday afternoon so the place wasn't overly busy, probably a good thing as we didn't wait long for our food.  Tried an order of chips and guac (good, but not nearly enough chips?  what the hell?) and several varieties of tacos.  My absolute favorite taco of the day, which is puzzling considering I'm a meat eater, was the crispy zucchini.  Panko crusted with just the right amount of seasoning, I would definitely order these ones again.  Others were good as well, not amazing, but good.    The \"roasted corn\" appetizer, while pretty, was an obscenely poor value, something like $5.99 for an out of season single piece of corn on the cob drizzled with sour cream and seasoning?  Ridiculous..  My advice, is while the food tastes good, don't come here if you're overly hungry or your bill is gonna be huge.  Portion sizes are pretty whack for the dollar"}
{"text":"Location is kind of hidden so we stumbled upon it by luck. This place has great Mexican music and the vibe is great. Server was a little slow even though it was at 20-30% capacity. Front manager was great - made the experience special.   Tried the corn - it was great. Would do it again. Tried the shrimp taco and fish taco. Would try burrito bowl for next time.   4/5*  Wilbur is still king of the taco in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best red sangria everrr!! I would come back for this.   Friendly service, great atmosphere - the largest taco restaurant I've been to, with a bit more formal vibe.   For tacos, I liked the Beef Cheek more than the Fish. Not a big fan of the tortillas though. Guac was good to share. Free pico de gallo with yelp check in."}
{"text":"Great staff. II am picky about Mexican food because of living in California for a long time. This was really good"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing drinks, good food and superb service! The space is dim, intimate, and open. So be prepared for it to be a little noisy and to yell, but it does add to the festive atmosphere. The drinks are strong and delicious. I had a sip of the margarita and it was lovely. For food, I shared 6 of the tacos and they were a hit and miss. My favorites were the lamb and chorizo, while the rest blended into the background. The braised beef ribs looked great and was reported to be delicious also.  The service was amazing and fully deserves the full extra star. Our server let us know that a party of 35 was about to order, so she took our orders first. We forgot the birthday candles, so she checked the back and found some for us. They let us bring a cake and provided extra plates/forks/a sharp knife for us to use. No complaints and we were well taken care of!"}
{"text":"Went here for a team lunch.  On a side note: I feel like my work has turned into sampling local restaurants, not that I'm complaining.  It was spacious and offered multiple seating options.  The food was terrific!  I had the tortilla with guacamole to start, I LOVE guacamole.  Then had the crispy zucchini and chicken tacos, both were delicious.  The chicken taco was especially juicy!  The rest of my team enjoyed the food as well.  Would likely return for another team lunch.  The only thing that prevented a five star was their service wasn't quite up to standard with their food.  No one even acknowledged us for a few minutes when we first entered, we were left looking around and wondering if we could seat ourselves.  Our server definitely did not want to be there that day."}
{"text":"I'm so upset with the server here. It was 11:30am and I brought my Starbucks. I realize it can be rude to drink coffee but I wanted to finish it. The server with an English/Australian accent was super rude. Avoid the server."}
{"text":"Just had a farmhouse cider, nacho appetizer, pimento burrito bowl, and a churro sundae. I can die happy now. Visiting from Washington, D.C. and definitely picked the right place for dinner! Michael was awesome!!"}
{"text":"I loved the decor in the restaurant.  It's very dim in the restaurant, perfect for a relaxing dinner with friends or loved ones. The service was on the slow side (took 45 min to get food), but we were warned by the server before ordering.  We got the Beer Battered Cod tacos, Sausage tacos and the Lobster tacos.  We also go the complimentary tortilla chips when you order a drink.  Overall the food was okay, but I was not impressed by it.  The flavour was good, but not to the point where I would want to drive 30 minutes for it.  As for the value, it's a bit expensive since it would take about 3-4 tacos to get full so it's about $21-$30 before taxes for one person.  The last thing that really turned me off was seeing the waitress use a towel to wipe the floor then using it again to wipe down the table. Overall the food and service was mediocre."}
{"text":"Service: we ordered a pitcher of drink for the group, but the drink did not come until mid way through the meal, and the place wasn't busy at all. I had to remind the staff, and even then there was a long delay.   Sanitation: the moment you walk in you can notice that the ground is super sticky and completely covered in dirt.   Food: all my friends who touched the beef taco had stomach issues the next day.   Food value: you get three small tacos that are very very plain in taste for a hefty $25. Stay away from the tacos, the burritos are better."}
{"text":"$5 pint for happy hour. Chicken burrito bowl was excellent and great quick service. Great menu selections"}
{"text":"Nothing really stood out to me about this place. There were some decent dishes but most were just okay.  Staff: Seated us quickly and took our orders in a reasonable amount of time. Unfortunately, our food all came out at different times, and there was one really delayed order. In addition, apparently they didn't have enough beef cheek for all the dishes we ordered, so we had to change some of our items.  Ambience: It is a large space with bright murals all over the restaurant. I wasn't fond of the seating of hard metal stools. It seemed very quiet for a Friday, but that worked well for me, as I have found some places to be overtly loud.  Food: I enjoyed the beer battered cod taco a lot. The flavours were there and the fish was perfectly fried. The chorizo burrito was mighty delicious, and it was much larger than anticipated (it could probably be shared by two people). Loved the fact that they were generous with the chorizo. The pork shoulder taco and the chicken taco were uneventful. The beef cheek burrito bowl was quite bad, with too much salt (maybe it was due the fact that it was the last of the beef cheek they had?). And finally, I love churros and was looking forward to the churro sundae, but it was not worth the price. In my opinion it was very small for the price ($9).  With the increasing amount of taco/Mexican places downtown, this one didn't stand out to me (for the right reasons)."}
{"text":"Given this place two chances now. Really wanted to like it however after a second disappointing visit I feel inclined to comment.  Came for the Cinco de Mayo menu on a Friday when it was relatively empty. Everything was priced way up. The chips and guac (regularly $5) was $8 today.  Took a good 20 minutes in an empty restaurant to get beer and 45 for our food to come. Tacos and burrito bowls.   When the burrito bowls finally came out they were delicious but how it took 45 minutes to put some meat on rice, I'm not sure....   The tacos were tiny and very disappointing especially at the inflated price."}
{"text":"I've perplexed that this place isn't drawing more of a crowd. Not that I'm really complaining, it was nice to arrive and be seated right away.   I've been here a few times and the food, service & value are very consistent. It's a great place to come for brunch / lunch if you live / work in the area. It's hard to find a place that will give you the portions like this nowadays. You won't leave there hungry...  The following dishes are definitely worth a try:  COSTILLA DE CARNE COCIDA HUEVOS RANCHEROS CARNITA BENEDICTOS"}
{"text":"I won't be coming back here. We waited 1 hour and a half to get our tacos on a Friday night when the place wasn't even half full (which perhaps I now understand why). Very cold and unapologetic server and manager. The manager gave us 10% off our bill but only after muttering an insult to us under his breath (which we of course heard). Mediocre tacos and cocktails are overpriced. Great ambiance but it doesn't make up for the incredibly poor and rude staff that work here."}
{"text":"Small portions, lacks flavour, you have to beg for chips, just an extremely horrible experience."}
{"text":"Their huevos rancheros was probably the best I've had in a while. The presentation was instagram-worthy. Service was also lovely.   My experience was less than spectacular thanks to attitude from a man who appeared to be their owner. I have to admit I was annoyed from the start with him sitting at the bar in a red shirt (possibly celebrating Canada Day) for a long time, therefore he appeared in the background of most of my pictures. Later when his kids came to visit, he seated them at the table next to ours and gave me the most unwelcoming, blank stare when I attempted to say hello.  There are so many Mexican eateries in Toronto, I definitely am not eager to go back to this one."}
{"text":"My bf & I were craving tacos and decided to try this place out.   The inside of this place is pretty big, it has a nice vibe, tons of seats and a bar area as well.   We decided to order 7 tacos in total (for takeout).  Cola De Langosta  (whole lobster tail, avocado, cucumber, radish, pico de gallo and tequila lime dressing.   Carnitas (x2) (pork shoulder, chichorone, salsa, beans & pickled carrots)  Chicken  (habanero, pineapple, salsa, pico degallo, cabbage &cucumber)  Chorizo  (sausage, potato & corn)  Prescaso Borracho  (Beer battered cod, avocado, crema, coleslaw & lime)  BARBACOA   (lamb, red onion, cherry tomato, cotija green cabbage)  These tacos are pretty small, the lobster taco didn't have much lobster inside, but the carnitas and beer battered cod had a lot of meat. They weren't as flavourful as I thought they would be.   For only 7 tacos, we paid a total of $68... that's a lot of money for these little tacos. We were still hungry afterwards. For that much money, you'd think the food would at least fill you up.   Overall, in my opinion this place deserves a 3.5/5. The restaurant itself is really nice but the tacos weren't the greatest, we've had better, and the taco prices are too expensive. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday evening with a friend, it was relatively empty so we're immediately seated. I was surprised to find Mexican fare this upscale, server was great, very romantic for tacos. The food flavours are great and food combinations are compliments each other. I particularly enjoyed the zucchini taco, has a crunch, juicy zucchini, a nice kick - it was a very exciting taco for a vegetarian offering. My complaint with the tacos is that the tortilla is way too small for the amount of toppings, made them feel tiny and extremely messy to eat. Prices were on high end and portions run small. I think for a girl, you'd need at least 1 shared app and 3-4 tacos to properly fill yourself."}
{"text":"This was more like a 3-3.5 for me. I've been wanting to try this place in what feels like forever since they opened. I came on a weekday night and the hostess asked if we had a reservation. I said no, and he asked how long we think we'd be here for because all the other tables were reserved. Uh... if you want business, don't ask people how long they'll take before they even sit down. Anyway, we said we'd be out of there in 1-1.5 hrs since we weren't planning to stick around.   We ordered a bunch of different tacos to try but the one that stuck out to me was how tasty the lobster one was. It's pricey but it was worth a try. I also enjoyed their fried avocado dish (I think that is what  it's called). Overall I thought it was decent. The bill was pretty expensive at the end (more than expected for tacos) and the waiter charged me for the check in chips even though it was free. He end up having to run back to recalculate our bill. If I'm feeling for tacos I may come back, but other than that my experience was okay."}
{"text":"Came back here more recently and I had to come back and tweak my review This time, the service was really slow - the restaurant was clearly understaffed and weren't expecting the amount of people they had for thursday at lunch. Our server was also the bartender and barely checked on us. And it took really long for him to take our order and for our food to come out. I also have to caution about their pricing - they are quite expensive for some really small portions. Their tacos are really small (no more than 2-3 bites) but they charge in the same range as other taco places that office a much bigger taco. $8 for a beef or lamb taco that I finish in 2 bites ... it's sort of expensive (I find that El Catrin or Grand Electric or a few other taco places are in line for pricing but offer a much larger taco). After sharing guac with 2 others and having 3 tacos, I can safely say I could've eaten more ... and with an over $25 cost for just that for lunch, I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"amazing margaritas!! go for happy hour and it is worth it  tacos are overpriced...but they are good"}
{"text":"Went here for a coworkers birthday lunch. Tacos were great! I had the lamb and carnitas tacos. Would definitely recommend! The only drawback was the service. It did take us quite a long time to get the bill."}
{"text":"I had dinner with a friend on a Thursday night .... when we arrived the noise level was acceptable for a conversation, by the time we left more than 2 hours later we had to scream to hear each other. I know that music gives the restaurant a nice vibe but we were really screaming at each other.  The menu has good options. The nachos were OK (guacamole very good), the short rib very tasty but the rice/corn side tasteless. My friend said the lamb burrito was quite good with it was huge. The tacos served at the next table looked nice - I think you'd need 2 for a meal (3 if you are really hungry).  Attention to service declined as the restaurant filled up, not enough staff . They have happy hour deals on beverages (drinks & beer) until 6:00. I may try it for lunch as I assume it won't be so noisy."}
{"text":"Amazing little drinking spot after work. Or even a date spot. I didn't have an entree but I didn't have a bunch of snacks. And the smokey tequila skull was cool. Per the decor and music. I'm very surprised they didn't have a dance floor. Because the tunes made me really get my dancing shoes out."}
{"text":"As a taco fan in Toronto, I wasn't impressed with the quality of what was served. We had the chorizo and beef cheek tacos and felt they were under seasoned and overpriced. With the same size tacos as grand electric, there's no reason for me to be paying triple the price. For me to come back, I think things need to be priced more competitively OR need to be more extravagantly served. Nothing special food wise.   Service wise, Manny is freakin awesome at the bar and would definitely come back to give him a hug!  Ambience and space wise - decent and think it would be an awesome private party venue."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this place after my friends and I saw it walking back to our hotel. Was a little disappointed with the food. The margarita tasted like straight tequila, no other flavor at all! The ceviche was good. My chicken bowl was a good portion and tasty. The queso was a big thumbs down!! Maybe it's because I'm from Texas but it was not I was expecting. Tasted like stinky socks. Gross! The service however was great. Very nice girl, and I did like the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, wasn't great. Service was really good.  Hard to say anything bad about this place, it's just that there are so many Mexican taco places in Toronto right now that I'm not sure this is the best one I've ever been to."}
{"text":"If Mexican food could be sexy, this would be it. We've tried a variety of tacos, the grilled corn, guacamole, and the fried zucchini appetizer. We also had the churro/ice cream dessert to seal the deal. All dishes were fresh, tasty, and presented nicely. Their cocktails were also strong and satisfying."}
{"text":"I debated rating this one... 3.5 or 4.  It definitely is a step up above El Catrin which I gave a 3 but is it as good as my most recent 4 star, Maple Leaf Tavern?  No so it stays a 3.5 star with a potential to be a 4 star.  Atmosphere: 3.5 to 4 star Food: 3.5 star Value: 3 star Service 3.5 star  This restaurant has a great vibe but only if you're not here with 2 people.  The restaurant has large windows out front and lets in a lot of light.  At night, each table has candlelight and the dimmed lighting with music makes it more hip and a great option for a date night.  The problem is the seating... for any couple, you're stuck at this awkward tables.  In the middle of the walkway with booths closely by or right up against a corner and wall.  It might be better to get seating at the bar where it looked like you had more space around you and likely less to be constantly hit by people walking by you.    The menu is easily laid out and the service is quick here... food came out near immediately and kept coming out quickly.  The waiter was nice and thoughtful though he seemed a bit unsure of himself at times on the menu.  But overall, better than average and everything cleared out quickly after each dish.  It just missed that personal touch that solidifies it as 4 star ... best way to describe El Local Loco is efficient service.  It's not a bad thing.   We did the check in to get the free tortilla chips and pico di gallo.  The sauce is TINY ... smaller than the sauce cup from Swiss Chalet. The good thing is they refill the tortilla chips for free.  I would hate to pay $4 for it but I didn't so that's ok.  We were recommended 2 to 3 tacos if we were hungry.  I can honestly say, they must feed the children if 2 would feed a hungry person haha.  I'm petite and 2 just barely filled me up with the chips AND a salad app.  I would say normal person should get at least 3.  The prices are PER taco so it can add up quickly if you're eating the better items on the menu.  The bean salad is quite a solid option... flavourful and a nice size to share.  I would recommend getting it.  I ordered the crispy zucchini and beer battered cod. We also got the carnita and chorizo.  The tacos are small.  More like their shell is really small ... but to their credit, they do overfill them but this is the reason why their tacos are small.  It makes for an awkward and messy eating.  The beer battered cod was cooked well but it was mostly flavourless... I would say they need to salt the cod or at least the batter.  Thankfully the coleslaw had some acidity to give it a lift.  The zucchini was much better.  The pico de gallo gave it the flavour and was pretty good.  The carnita and chorizo were mentioned to be good as well.  The bean salad was a good option to help fill us up and was a good size to split between 2 people.  Though the prices was somewhat reasonable, I left slightly hungry considering I ate what was considered a full dinner.  Comparing this to 7 Lives, 7 Lives rules for flavour & value but El Local definitely tops for atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican restaurant!! The tacos are just so awesome!! Really enjoy the food there!!! The service is great and the price is reasonable as well. Would definitely go again next time!"}
{"text":"The most important reason this is getting a five star is because of the bartender. Originally from Canada's capital of Ottawa, he was a new resident of Toronto. He was very friendly to us American visitors and helped us figure out our plans for the rest of the day. Also, i should mention he did make a great margarita!   We stopped in to el local loco for a drink before an appointment we had and it was great! We got two margaritas and a Canadian beer. We are not very familiar with Canadian prices so it always feels expensive but the margaritas were around 12 to 14. My boyfriend got the cocktail with jalape√±os which was the perfect amount of spicy (maybe a little heavy on the basil and cilantro). I got the grande margarita, which had a little shot of what I think was the orange simple syrup in a lime so for presentation! They also weren't stingy with their alcohol, I was feeling great after one drink!   I plan to come back here in my short visit to Toronto !"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Came here for a corporate lunch. It was 24 of us and the kitchen was understaffed. The servers took over an hour to bring out our food and brought out the wrong orders. Such a disappointing place. Terrible customer service and extremely average food."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican food which is very tasty. The place is very chill and they play Spanish music, feels like I'm in Mexico enjoying tacos and tasty chips. If your down  by the ACC and feel for Mexican, this is the place to go eat to and satisfy your Mexican craving!"}
{"text":"Food is okay, server was not used to handling larger groups (12), the wait time for each drink was ridiculous, our food orders got mixed up several times and although there were ads that if u check in on yelp you get free nachos, both my friend and I were charged it on our bills.   Also, I got stuck with a mysterious $40 bill, which after seeing how the server handled our tabs and orders, i wouldn't be surprised if he fudged it and that belonged to no one."}
{"text":"Came here after work on a Thursday long weekend and the place was packed!  The music was blasting, a game was on and the large crowd made it very loud.  It was hard to have a conversation without yelling.  However, the food tasted great!    We made reservations just in case (thankfully so) and we were seated pretty quickly.    We started with the crispy avocado.  Mostly tasted like a warm avocado but the tomato salsa like topping added great flavor.    Between the three of us we ordered a variety of tacos (3 each at approx 3\" in diameter per taco).  My favorite was the lobster tail, followed by the beer battered cod and lastly the beef cheeks.  The seafood tacos had a lighter meat taste so you could taste the toppings a lot better.  If you like a strong saucey meat than go with the beef cheeks which was recommended by our waiter.  My friend ordered the octopus taco and said it tasted alright except that it was a bit chewy.  Lastly we got the churro dessert which has a peanut butter flavour to it which I loved with vanilla ice cream on top.    The staff was great!  The waiter followed up shortly after each time food was served but gave enough time inbetween to not constantly interrupt conversations.    I'd definitely come back again and maybe next time try out their weekend brunch which also sounds pretty delicious."}
{"text":"4.5/5.   I have been seeing this place on Yelp for a while and decided to come here with a friend. I made a reservation through OpenTable with no issues. The check in process was easy and was sat down at a nice high table in the back. The atmosphere is lively (on a Thursday) and well decorated.   My friend ran late but the server did not pressure me to order quickly and kindly went over the drinks menu with me. Then he did it again with my friend.  When my friend arrived, we decided to each get a Margarita ($11). The Margarita was well made with a decent amount of alcohol. I thought the size of the drink was quite reasonable for the price actually. Also with the Yelp Deal, we got some tortilla chips and Pico de Gallo. The chips were crunchy and probably deep fried so it was wonderful. The Pico de Gallo was fresh and a great starter to have for free.   I already ate a snack before my meal so I decided to split the \"MAIZ MEXICANO ENTERO\" - which was Mexican Whole Corn. It was so good, well seasoned, well roasted and just very delicious. I would recommend that to anyone who is a fan of corn!  I decided to only get one taco and asked the server to choose between the Octopus vs. The Lobster Tail taco. He recommended the Octopus (the cheaper option!). When it came, it was pretty small to be honest even for Tacos. The flavours were a lot more powerful and well composed compared to how it looked. So overall, discounting the price ($8) for how much food it was, it was delicious as well.   My friend and I decided to satisfy our sweet tooth by getting the Churros Sundae. The warm cinnamonny Churro was a perfect compliment to the ice cream as well as the nuts. The first bite was heavenly. However, toward the end, this was a little bit too much for me. But I'm not the biggest fan of sweets regardless!   Overall, great food and solid drinks in a nice ambient atmosphere. I feel like a place like this was needed down in the St. Lawrence Area so I'm glad that it was opened up here :)"}
{"text":"Ended up booking a Birthday here for 11 people.  Staff was fantastic, food was excellent and the restaurant was very accommodating.   Would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I am just going to put it out there that I currently work at a Mexican tacos and tequila restaurant. It's in a different city, so no competitiveness here, but I do feel like I compare every Mexican restaurant I go to now to the one that I work. That might be why my rating for El Local Loco is so low compared to others.   Place: For what it is, the restaurant is big and spacious with very nice ambiance in terms of lighting, music, and decor. I also really appreciated how they have online reservations as an option via OpenTable. They also had a pico de gallo offer going on where it was free if you checked in on Yelp. I love it when restaurants utilize their social media presence! It is such a big avenue for potential customers. The hostess and server we had were very nice. However, this is where the raving ends for me with El Local... it was a short-lived, shallow romance.   Drinks and Apps: I ordered the Mexicana as my drink of choice. It was very good, just tart enough to prevent it from tasting like juice. However, for $12 it was an incredibly small cocktail. This is not a huge problem for me, as I am extremely \"light-weight\", but I can see how this could upset many people. I had the pico de gallo and the Mexican corn next. The pico de gallo was good...but it was also free. If I had had to pay for it, I would not have been satisfied; it lacked flavour. The corn was good, no complaints.   Food: Tacos were next, and with them came a slew of problems. I got the crispy zucchini and the chicken. They were okay, no complaints but very basic. There was nothing interesting about these tacos I could have made them at home, to be honest. I did really enjoy the hot sauce they have that comes in a glass skull though. It really made the tacos better. I also preferred the zucchini tacos to the chicken which was a pleasant surprise. The friend I came to eat with got the lobster taco sans avocado due to an allergy. When he bit into his taco he realized there was guac in it... He told me to leave it and that he had brought allergy medication with him but I was too upset, I did not want him to go through discomfort for hours just because there had been a mistake. I told the waiter we had asked for no avocado and he said that's guac... guac was not listed on the menu for this taco. The lobster taco said avocado and we said no avocado, I had assumed avocado = guac. I let the server know about the allergy and he quickly apologized and took it back to the kitchen. He brought back another lobster taco... this taco was full of corn! My friend was allergic to corn too but had not bothered to tell the waiter since corn was not listed in the lobster taco AND was not in the original. It was like the chef substituted the avocado with whatever he pleased, which was extremely unprofessional. My friend and I are not very outspoken people. My friend insisted that he could flick off the corn and I was too annoyed to speak up again. We just paid for our food and left after that.   Main complaint here would be that the menu and food are not consistent. I would recommend the servers asking about allergies so our avocado - guac fiasco doesn't happen again. Cute place but probably not worth the trip back for me.   Recommend: Mexican corn, crispy zucchini taco (use the skull sauce)  [BIG APPOLOGIES FOR NO PICTURES]"}
{"text":"Came here last night with a party of 30. This place let us make reservations which was awesome. The two servers at our table did an excellent job and everyones orders came out at a good pace. The guac and chips were tasty not to mention that they refilled the chips which you barely see any restaurants do. We tried 4 of the tacos and they were flavourful. A lot of us had the burrito bowl which I heard no complaints about. And I heard the bean salad was also yummy! Good place."}
{"text":"A great Mexican restaurant with delicious food and just a really fun vibe. It was really busy but service was fast and waiters were great!  Fish, zucchini, and pork tacos were great but more than anything else the lamb tacos were absolutely incredible!   Churro sundae was a great twist on a classic desert!    P.s. Gotta love the free picco de gallo with the yelp check in!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night for a group dinner. We all started off with margaritas while waiting. I was surprised that a Mexican restaurant didn't have more flavours of margaritas. The only option was lime. It was still good and complimented the food. For food I had their veggie bowl but asked for it to be prepared vegan (no cheese or sour cream). It was honestly so flavourful but the portions were kind of small. I ended up stuffing my face with the freebie offer we got for checking in.  The staff here (especially our server) was so nice and accommodating and kept checking in with us.  It was good but I wouldn't go or out of my way to come back"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 12 for cinco de mayo, due to the expected rush we had reserved tables in advance. Im not generally a complainer, having worked in the restaurant industry. But I don't think I would return.   The food was absolutely delicious. Me and my friend shared the shrimp ceviche then tried various tacos. We checked in through yelp and got the free app. Next, I had the chorizo, shrimp and carnitas. The menu is a little misleading in that it doesn't say how many tacos are provided - the answer is one. None the less the food was good. I had a margarita which was heavy in tequila, just the way I like it. Yum.   The downfall of this place for me would be the service. Our server started as a nice gentlemen but as people arrived and the night progressed his attitude got progressively worse. First he advised that under no circumstances was any one allowed to switch seats because that would make separate bills confusing. Once we all got drinks he took one food order and left, another person had to call him bad and advise that yes, all of us did want to eat. As people left over the course of the evening he would show us less and less attention or only stop buy to \"slam\" a beer on the table. Finally when we were cashing out i paid my bill and waited for the other three remaining to pay theirs, in this time I noticed that not only did he charge me for the free app, he also did not split the ceviche. We pointed this out for the others that had not paid, to which he removed it. I asked if he could deduct the cost from my friends bill since a refund seemed silly to which he said \" no it's gone you already paid but I can give you your $4 back\". I declined as this seemed petty considering the $10 tip I gave him. as someone who has worked in the industry i thought his attitude was highly rude and his customer service skills were definitely lacking.   In my opinion, as long as guests are in the restaurant they deserve respect. Especially since we were actively ordering drinks after we ate."}
{"text":"Why not celebrate pre-hump day with a taste of Mexico!!!  I was welcomed by two guys playing latino music on their guitars.  It was a fantastic first impression!!!   Also exiting was the creativeness put into designing the space for the restaurant - so many interesting art and decor scattered throughout.  The restaurant would have an intimate ambience if the music wasn't so loud that people had to shout at each other to be heard. Now for the food.  My friends and i decided to order a couple of appertizers to share.  When the dishes came out, we realized we had to order more because the quantity of the appertizers were insufficient to satisfy our hunger.  So each one of us ordered a taco.  When they got to our table, i have to say that they were the smallest tacos i have ever seen! So we then proceeded to order two more entr√©es to share.  To summarize,  we kept ordering food because we were still hungry.  The quantity of each dish was small.   BUT the presentation of each dish was pretty.  The tastes overall were just ok.  I really liked the zucchini fritters because the flavour stood out.    My favourite was dessert - churro and ice cream.  The churro was so tasty.  It's a little crisp on the outside and meltingly soft inside.  I will definitely go back again for churro.   Last but not least, the service.  The server who looked after us was friendly and really good at his job.  I mean REALLY.  He kept suggesting additional food.  And when he realized that we were done with eating, he started suggesting and showing us interesting looking bottles of tequila etc.  My friends were persuaded to order a few drinks.  The server tried his salesmanship on me.  He was subtle, but i stayed resolute to my one very expensive glass of cocktail.  REALLY!  He was sooo good at upselling with his charm and ease of comfort that i can see him successfully sell sand to a thirsty man in a desert."}
{"text":"Visited this place with coworkers during weekday lunch.  The restaurant was relatively empty except for three or four tables of diners.    We placed our orders as soon as we sat down.  Then the wait game began.  20mins passed by...25mins passed by... and finally around the 30mins mark, food was served.   I could understand the wait if the restaurant was busy but no, it's largely unoccupied.    As for food, I ordered the chicken burrito bowl.  The portion of meat is ample and well seasoned.  Mix it with the guacamole on top and it becomes a fantastic dish.  Only setback is tortilla chips provided was not enough to finish the bowl.  So make sure to check-in on Yelp to get a complimentary order of tortilla chips.    Overall, food is decent but service is lacking.  I would give this another try for other food offerings."}
{"text":"LOVED this place. Really hip little place.  Yet another place I never knew existed until a friend told me about it. Came after a Jays game for dinner and what a feast we had!  The appetizer nachos with salsa and guac were absolutely delicious. So fresh and the nachos are made in house. DELICIOUS.   For my mains, which were kind of small, but ridiculously delicious, I had the lamb and beef tacos. Again, they were small, but consuming 3 of them, plus the nachos, filled me right up and kept me full for the evening. I dont know what exactly they put in their lamb taco, but I would return solely for this. Absolutely delicious!  Our server was great and full of information. He answered all the questions we had and even made some recommendations as it was our first time there. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for some home made style mexican food !!  Price: $$ / $$$$ Quality: **** / ***** Would I return?: ABSOLUTELY"}
{"text":"Margaritas taste good but were tiny. The food was great, hands down! The place has a cool vibe im general.   Service was bad though. The host said all tables were reserved and made us sit in the bar. No problem at all, but after 2 hours sitting in the bar we noticed half tables were still empty. Other people seem to be in the same situation and were not happy either, especially considering the servers in bar are not enough and do not seem to have experience serving food. My food came before I had utensils, they took my friends drink half full by mistake, server couldn't hear us well, etc.   The place is new so I will still give it other try."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night hoping to get our taco fix. El Local Loco is located along the Esplanade and is known for their large selection of tacos ranging from your regular el pastor tacos to more fancier items like Lobster Tail Tacos. Their menu also includes burritos as well.   Right off the bat our waitress told us that the tacos were quite small so we ended up ordering three each. While they are on the small side, it comes with a good amount of filling. The first one I tried was the Beef Cheek. It wasn't as tender as I thought it could be or that flavorful. Next was the lamb. This one was definitely a lot more juicy and flavorful but man, did they overdo it with the salt! I was gulping down water after that. I decided to be fancy and tried the lobster tailas well. It was good, but wasn't great.   All in all, I was a bit disappointed with the tacos I got. My friend got the fish tacos which were really delicious so I guess it depends on what you end up getting."}
{"text":"Lovely vibe inside, good music, great lights inside, perfect volume. Smoke tequila skull was fantastic. Service was great. Guac and chips was a little too garlicy. Fairly pricey though."}
{"text":"I had a lovely relaxed dinner here on a work trip. I sat alone at the bar and the bartender was the right mix of friendly and remote, so I could mostly read my book but also ask questions.  I ordered the fried avocado for an appetizer and it was really interesting. I think I prefer guacamole if I'm going to get an avocado-based dish, but I'm glad I tried this. My dinner was a burrito bowl that looked small but ended up being a little too much to finish! The chicken in it was especially flavorful.   I asked for hot sauces and was given their trio to use. All three sauces were tasty, but I was disappointed that none of them really brought the heat. I was comfortable dousing my food in the scotch bonnet sauce in the skull shaped bottle, and I am NOT someone with a high heat tolerance. It would be nice to see an option that's a little closer to scorching."}
