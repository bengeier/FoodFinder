{"text":"Super delicious and super fast. I think I waited for less than a minute for my food which could of been a bad thing but when I opened the box all worries were gone. I got the ropa vieja which was shredded pork with a tomato base and it was unbelievably juicy and delicious. It also came with  rice and beans and a side salad which were also perfect. This order was about $7 which isn't bad at all considering the quality. However, if you're looking for quantity, this isn't the right place. Definitely try it out if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Concept: Brilliant. Execution: Well Done.

Is your nation at odds with the US? Conflict Kitchen will probably serve your ethnic food soon. I have had Cuban and Venezuelan. I have missed Afghan, Syrian, and much more. The food preparation is excellently researched. The result is delicious and priced for the college student. Since they moved to Schenley Plaza, there is always a line, but it moves rather swiftly. Conflict Kitchen is take-out only with plenty of seating options nearby. 

If you find yourself near Pitt/CMU and you're hungry and curious..."}
{"text":"I love Conflict Kitchen. Interesting and innovative idea, and food I've tried has been so delicious. I was out of town for 10 days and have been craving their pumpkin-yogurt side dish and basil lemon drink from the Afghanistan menu. I see now it has changed to Venezuela, and look forward to trying the cuisine. Also very convenient location in Oakland if you work or study at the universities."}
{"text":"I came here when they were serving Cuban food. It was everything!!! I spent many years living in Miami, where there is Cuban food on every corner.  This was just as good as anything I had there.  Where do I began:  ropa vieja (shredded beef), congris (black beans and rice), tostones (fried green plaintains).  All were excellent!"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to make it to Conflict Kitchen before they move at the end of the month to the Strip District. I loved it. We had the broiled yuca and the slow cooked pork. Both platters come with rice and beans and a cabbage salad. The food was delicious and it was very interesting to read about Cuba on the food packaging."}
{"text":"Every single thing about this place is fantastic from its greater goals of educating people about countries in conflict with the US, to what I go for - the food. It's always good. Always. 

The roast pork they had when Cuba was the featured country is something I still annoyingly mention when I pass Schenley Plaza. The kebab and halva I enjoyed today off their Iranian menu infused my day with happiness. The people are friendly and they're always doing interesting events. A+ Pittsburgh find."}
{"text":"Yo probé su intento de \"ropa vieja\", pero no me gusto mucho...carece de sabor. Por otro lado, el agua fresca esta buenísima."}
{"text":"Premise: they have food from countries the US is in conflict with. Delicious, creative, quick, and cheap! No complaints. There are a lot of nice places to sit outside (with dogs, extra bonus). People are nice. There's a really tasty drink on the menu currently (Afghan cuisine right now). They'll switch to Venezuelan in a week, though."}
{"text":"Expectations were blown out of the water.  Small portions, but truly excellent flavors and attention to detail.  Little blueberries in my salad and beautiful greens with the perfectly grilled quail. Venison was excellent.  Far less expensive than same food you'd expect at a nu-yuppie farm to table joint, all with compelling politics.  Root veggies were seasoned too sweetly for our palates, but average folks probably won't mind."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love it. Great concept, convenient (to me) location and tasty sounding food. Unfortunately, the food was just not good. I had the chicken and avocado arepa from the current Venezuelan menu, and it was all cornmeal patty and barely a smear of filling - and little bit of filling that I did get had no flavor. Very disappointed that this place was so overrated. Maybe the previous menus were better, or maybe Yelpers are rating this place more on concept than food."}
{"text":"Great concept.  This takeout place supports conflict awareness and tries to catalyze conversation about these hostilities.   Conflict Kitchen only serves food (and it's delicious) from countries the US is in conflict with.  

Some of the employees try to visit the country or nearby country prior to serving the food, and learn from locals or refugees about the food.  They also interview and have conversations with the people, and they put this information into pamphlets about entertainment, art, customs, etc...

Conflict Kitchen has served food from Cuba and now North Korea.  For North Korea, they visited South Korea and had conversations with refugees.  

The line does get a bit long during lunch when school is in session.  
The pamphlets are challenging to read as it is many quotes, with no paragraphs, summary or transition.  Some pictures, maps, or images would also be nice.

All in all--great idea and tasty food."}
{"text":"Food: Conflict Kitchen rotates what they serve approximately every 6 months.  They offer 3-4 choices from the cuisine of a country the Unite States is or was in military conflict with.  Past countries have been Afghanistan and Iran, and the current cuisine is Venezuela.  They currently offer three arepas, which are like sandwiches where the \"bread\" is made of corncake and it is stuffed with goodis.  The choices are chicken with avocado, a black bean mixture (vegan), and queso (vegetarian).  We got the black bean and queso versions.  Both were stuffed full making the arepa about the size of a small hamburger.  We split 3 between the two of us, and it was enough to fill us up for lunch.  One may not be quite enough.  The queso version was bland, its just cheese on bread.  It could definitely use something else (I put hot sauce on it at home).  The black bean arepa was much better.  It had more ingredients and much more flavor.

Price: The arepas are $5 each.  We also got 2 bottled sodas which were $3 each.  Our total came to $21, which wasn't bad, but considering how much food you get, the price is a little steep for lunch.

Drinks: They offer bottled water and other drinks like unique sodas.  We got \"Jamaica's Finest\" ginger beers, and they were the most potent and delicious ginger beers we had ever tried.  I'm guessing you can get these at other places too, but we hadn't seen them before.

Atmosphere: It is located on Baum Blvd. near its intersection with Highland Ave. next to the Waffle Shop.  Its just a window.  You order the food, wait about 10 minutes for them to prepare it (dress warm if its winter), and then take it somewhere to eat.  

Service: The girl at the window was very friendly.  She explained the food options, she asked us how we found out about them and if we had been there before, she explained the concept and motive of the restaurant, and went into detail about how they decide which cuisine to represent and how they develop the recipes.  They also provide you with a small pamphlet that comes with your food that has interviews with citizens from the featured country.  It is informative and interesting.

(+): very unique and interesting concept, nice people working there

(-): the food is average to slightly above-average for the price

Would I go back again? I will likely try each cuisine at least once.  I probably will not go back for Venezuelan food, but Cuba is supposedly on deck, and if there is a vegetarian option, I will try it.  I think it is worth going once to try something new, learn something, and support a creative idea."}
{"text":"Their cuban menu options are plentiful! And I love the concept of the place a lot. Great service and it's very scenic sitting on Schenley lawn. 

However, the actual food quality was lacking. I went at 5pm and I got the empanada picadillo and the meat was cold inside.  I was really let down. And it says there was raisins and olives in the mix, but I did not taste either. 

I must say though, I have been here before and the food was amazing. So maybe it was just this one time."}
{"text":"I live on the other side of town from Conflict Kitchen and have been very eager to try the current Cuban cuisine.  Finally had the opportunity and I'm sorry to report that I was disappointed.  

My mother came from Cuba to the U.S. at age 15, and I grew up eating her delicious meals along with some amazing Cuban food in Miami and Atlanta.  Needless to say, the bar has been set very high.  Over the weekend, I went with friends to C.K. and we ordered a huge variety; Picadillo, Ropa Vieja, Shredded Pork, Yuca, Tostones, Maduros, black beans and rice and some guava and cream cheese pastries. 

One word of advice Conflict Kitchen...never, ever, ever add cinnamon to Picadillo!  It doesn't belong there and it is too overpowering.  Good Picadillo is easy to make ... I can make it!  The raisins, green olives, cumin, garlic, onion and green peppers are all that is needed to season the beef. The shredded beef and pork were decent.  The yuca (kinda like a potato) was perfect, except for the portion size of about 3 tablespoons served over a filler of black beans and rice.  Honestly, we had more meat in our order than yuca!  Someone in a previous post mentioned that the Tostones had the texture of cardboard, but that is kind of typical for tostones.  I thought they were very good - as well as the sweet plantains (Maduros).  Loved the lime/garlic sauce served with the tostones.  The pastries were okay, but kinda dry.  Come to think of it, a lot of the food seemed \"dry\".  Maybe C.K. should try to use a little more oil.

Still searching for Cuban food, as I know it, in Pittsburgh.  Can't seem to be found:(  

I give Conflict Kitchen props for the concept and very much enjoyed reading the literature that was handed out."}
{"text":"Update: This year's Persian food is actually much better and closer to the real one. The Ash is very delicious and although Kabob torsh is a bit raw and hard to chew on, it is really really delicious! Big improvement!"}
{"text":"awesome concept.  have had their iranian and palestinian food.  both were very good and a great cultural experience/education.    i hope the north korean and venezuelan food come back at some point."}
{"text":"Conflict Kitchen is impressive and not only for the politics! They make honestly good, authentic food that somehow translates well with a summer day out with friends on the adjacent lawn or the park. Where else in Pittsburgh can you grab a spicy Afghan stew on a summer afternoon right before a free concert? Or a couple orders of Venezuelan arepas and peach juice for a road trip? Great concept and food."}
{"text":"We LOVED Conflict Kitchen. The concept is great and with each order we received a leaflet full of information and interviews from Iranian people. The food was excellent (We ordered lamb and split pea fritters and Trout stuffed with caramelised onions), it was also very reasonably priced. I wish there was one in every city."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the concept and the food here. Recently went to try their Palestinian food--the fattoush was excellent. Always have plenty of vegetarian options. People who work here are knowledgeable and love to talk when it's less crowded. Favorite place to eat in Oakland"}
{"text":"With so much variety and a constantly changing menu, I am so impressed by how consistently delicious Conflict Kitchen's food is. I love getting to chow down on an affordable, delicious, and filling meal while also reading about a new culture I usually have very little exposure to. One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is closed and I never had the chance to try it, but I'm still giving it 5 stars for the unique concept and effort. I heard about the backlash. So much for freedom of speech and expression. Keep it classy America."}
{"text":"Loved the concept.  Sadly, the East Liberty location is closed now.  BUT they will re-open in Schenley Plaza as of April 2013!"}
{"text":"The food and the concept are both good, but not amazing, hence the 4 star rating. It's a fun thing to do for the novelty, but that wears off."}
{"text":"Past reviews discuss the concept, so no need for me to.

The country I experienced was Afghanistan. I tried the Lamb Tikka Kabab.

At first glance it didn't look like there was much food for the price attached to the dish (only 3 lamb cubes, over rice, with a green sauce on the side for $7.50). But, looks can be deceiving.

The food tasted great! a good blend between spicy, and flavorful. I finished the meal satisfied.

I recommend this place, and am personally excited to try other Afghan dishes, as well as dishes from around the world."}
{"text":"The concept behind Conflict Kitchen is great, and I love knowing that the food I'm eating is made as authentically as possible. I've stopped by several times for Venezuela and Palestine, and I enjoyed everything I tried. There are tables and chairs near the stand; it's a good place to enjoy the food when the weather's nice. This place isn't the cheapest around campus, though."}
{"text":"I recently visited Pittsburgh for the first time, and Conflict Kitchen was one of the biggest reasons for the visit. That's a lot of pressure for a storefront stand that's a six hour drive from New York, but it was definitely worth it. I was intrigued by the concept of a kitchen that only serves food from nations that the United States is currently in conflict with. Each menu item is served in wrapping that contains information about the situation and interviews with people from that country.

The kitchen is currently serving Afghan bolanis, which look a lot like calzones in this instance (not sure if they always look like this). We asked the server for her recommendations and tried the red lentil and the spinach, both of which were delicious. The spinach also come with a very tasty yogurt sauce. 

The menu changes every few months to serve food from countries the United States is in conflict with - follow them on Twitter @conflictkitchen for updates. Venezuela is up next. I hope to be able to return to this place in the near future and try the Waffle Shop next door, which is run by the same owner."}
{"text":"Amazing stop in Pittsburgh. The park its in is beautiful.  The food was the perfect portion size, fresh, and delicious. The material was informative and authentic first hand stuff you just don't get access to in mass media. Apparently they have differrnt flavored sherbat drink and today was lime. I'm only disappointed I won't be back for more... at least for awhile... unless they come to Nashville? :-)"}
{"text":"There is a fair amount of buzz surrounding this place and I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of food quality, especially since their menu changes drastically every month. I'm happy to say that conflict kitchen lives up to the hype that surrounds it. The concept is great and everything we ate was delicious."}
{"text":"Great concept and awful hours. I like the bolanis being served right now, they're savory and one of the best ways to warm yourself up in the winter."}
{"text":"Such a great idea for an on the go restaurant. Its a great way to introduce ethnic food to the park. WIth the change in menus there is always something offered that anyone could find enjoyable. I was originally turned off by the idea of a restaurant in the park, but I have never had an issue with any of my meals here. For a reasonable price its a great substitute to going downtown- with the atmosphere of the park!"}
{"text":"Had some great Persian food, though it was more of the cheap, filling, and street food kind rather than 100% authentic or fancy - but that's ok. 

For $23, we got 2 boxes of Jujeh (chicken) kebab and Koresht Bademjan (beef and eggplant stew) both with plenty of rice and veggies, as well as two sharbat drinks (orange and mint - the orange one was better if you like sweet, the mint if you like tangy).

Food came out fast - the rice could have been cooked just a bit longer, but other than that, we were very satisfied. 

The restaurant certainly fills its unique mission as there were flyers available for us the read about Iranian views on various topics - American military intervention, sanctions, the Revolution, the nuclear program, Israel, and women's rights (to name just a few).

Come here for good food and to learn a few things you won't pick up on national news."}
{"text":"I'm late to the party, but this might be my new favorite lunch place!  Too bad I discovered it 2 weeks before I'm outta here.

I'm taking an intensive language program at Pitt and get a fairly short lunch break.  Conflict Kitchen caught my eye when I wandered across the street to Schenley Plaza, so I decided to give it a go since it seemed like a quick, relatively inexpensive, and interesting pick since I'd never eaten Iranian food before.  My program director had told us about Conflict Kitchen's aim of only serving food from \"Axis of Evil\"/\"Outpost of Tyranny\"/*insert other Bush-era terminology here* nations, so I wanted to give it a try anyway, the child of the '00s that I am.

Resisting the urge to try everything on the menu, I went with the pomegranate-walnut chicken and sharbat.  The pomegranate chicken itself was tasty -- slowly cooked and tender with a pleasant, not-too-sweet flavor.  Unfortunately, there was not a whole lot of it.  The majority of the box's content was rice and, in the corner, a very tiny helping (maybe a tablespoon) of pickled vegetables.  Bummer.  The sharbat (sweetened, herb-infused water) had a really interesting and refreshing taste, though.  Additionally, the pamphlet they gave me containing interviews with Iranians on a myriad of cultural and political topics made for an interesting lunchtime read.  

Despite my overall meal being slightly disappointing, Conflict Kitchen's concept, mission, chicken, and sharbat were enough to entice me back for another try.  Definitely a good call.

When I stopped by today, I pledged to try something different...ideally something with way less rice.  To my surprise, the facade of the stand had changed, as had the menu -- to Cuban food.  Perplexed, being the Pittsburgh n00b I am, I asked the lady taking my order whether this is something they do often.  For fellow non-locals: Conflict Kitchen switches things up every 4-6 months and serves Afghani and Venezuelan cuisines in addition to Iranian and Cuban.  Excellent!  I feel fortunate to have discovered 2 of the 4 in my short time here.

This time, I left a happy camper with a box full of tender roasted pork, flavorful rice & beans (a good ratio this time), and a fresh cabbage salad.  A balanced, healthy, delicious, and filling array of food for ~$7, combined with a mission of exploring and better understanding the world through food, education, and conversation?  I'm on board."}
{"text":"The first time I went it was like how mom used I make. I have a Cuban family and I was really incredibly impressed since it was the closest thing I had since home cooking in a long while. I loved it so much I HAD to go again. The next week in fact. In that week it was like night and day. The portions and the containers had changed and the food was just salty instead of complex. It was from five stars to two so I'm splitting the difference on the lower end because there is nothing worse then looking so forward to something and then being disappointed by a complete lack of consistency. I will probably go back but with a heart ready to be broken."}
{"text":"Currently serving Cuban dishes. We sampled from the Yuca con Mojo, the Congri (black beans & rice), the yuca chips with mojo sauce and the Cuban salad. Love the concept of featuring countries the US is in conflict with; food can always bring us closer,no? The Yuca main dish was so tasty. The chips with the hot sauce were yummy. A definite not to be missed. The next installation will feature Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"I tried out the Conflict Cafe aka Kubideh Kitchen today after reading about it recently and it was great, art never tasted so good. The 2 girls working there were really friendly and explained the idea behind it which you can read about at their site. Since this is a food review I'll talk about the food.

Currently they only serve one item, called kubideh, with seasoned ground meat in freshly baked seeded flat bread with onion, mint, and basil and it is delicious. They don't beat you over the head with political discussions but leave you with a little food for thought while you eat...no pun intended.

I would highly recommend checking it out if you haven't been there and will return myself. If you're heading over make sure that you go during hours they'll be there since they have a pretty small window which they're open (from 11am-2pm daily.)"}
{"text":"We had Persian food (I had the pomegranate and walnut chicken with rice and pickled veggies) and it was excellent. I loved the flavor and consistency of the chicken , the pickled veggies with bread was very flavorful and tasty, and I loved the vinegar and mint drink very unique and tasty. The staff were very friendly and down to earth and you could tell they made a diligent effort to learn about the food and the culture. I also had the saffron ice cream which was also very good. The setting is also very beautiful as it is right in Schenley Park with views of the Cathedral of Learning. In summary, quick service, excellent food, friendly, knowledgeable and diligent staff, interesting concept, and beautiful setting equals 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Food is great, and it's always interesting to see what nations food they will be serving next.

Quality can vary from time to time."}
{"text":"This is such a unique establishment on the large mall of the campus of UPitt. From what I heard, this restaurant or food shack was established by a professor as an interactive statement piece of art to raise awareness of countries that are in conflict with the U.S. The cuisine changes often and when I went, the country was Cuba. I had a tray of Tostones - twice fried plantains with mojo sauce and I got some hot sauce. My friend ordered the stewed okra on top of rice with mojo sauce. I loved my Tostones and was so surprised at the 8 pieces I got for 3.75$. My friend also loved her dish! The mojo sauce was delicious! It was vinegary with a kick of garlic and chili peppers. I also really enjoyed the hot sauce - whatever it was made of, it cleared out my sinuses! What an awesome place to eat and try plantains for the first time!"}
{"text":"I ordered a main dish with okra and it's much more tasty than I expected! No wonder there is always a line in front of this small food stand. Strongly recommend to try this out! The okra (come with flatbread)'!"}
{"text":"After hearing about Conflict Kitchen from family, it was about time I made it there this weekend.  Clearly I timed it just right because they have switched to Cuban food, which I don't know all that much about it except that I like it and the food at Conflict Kitchen was no exception.  We treated it as more of a snack and bought one of each of the veggie items along with some not too sweet lemonade like drinks.   All very good. 

Even better, the new location allows you to make the drive into town, if you are not already there, and pair your visit with a lot of other cool options.  How about the Tower of Learning international rooms like we visited on this trip?  Perhaps you are in the mood for one of the museums or the library all within walking distance or just take a stroll on Pitt's or CMU's campus. 

I look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"This month it was Iranian food. Everything was delicious. The fish was my favorite. They also made a nice yogurt cucumber soup. I am very impressed with how much variety is offered. Also the prices are very reasonable and makes a very nice picnic lunch on a summer day. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Such a great idea. I always believe that food brings people together and a great way to learn about a culture is to learn about their cuisine. Plus it's in a great location."}
{"text":"I give this place two stars. One star per piece of hair I found in my gross goat coconut dish."}
{"text":"Passionate people being passionate about their food.  I asked a question related to \"the conflict\" and knowledgeable person on the other side of the counter kept talking and explaining the situation to me that the long line started forming behind me, making me smile how much they care.  I did not hear anybody saying anything bad about the food - it goes from very good to excellent, pending on the region and food. See you next time Conflict Kitchen."}
{"text":"Finally went here for lunch after what seemed like one thousand years of 'meaning to'. Currently they're offering Iranian food.

We ordered two different courses, mine was vegetarian (pan fried potato and onion patties)  and Mack got the chicken kebabs. Mine was excellent, though not the most filling lunch I've ever had. Mack's chicken was a bit tough and it was hard to taste the marinade, which was a bit disappointing. Not sure if all of their main courses are hit or miss, but I was in love with my lunch and he wished he got what I did.

A+ for the complimentary black tea, and the sweetened water beverage Mack ordered was delicious. I'll probably be back to either try the other Iranian stuff I didn't get this time, or whatever fun adventures they come up with next! On a nice day, it would be great to be eat in the Plaza, too!"}
{"text":"This version is for the Iran iteration of Conflict Kitchen.

Conflict Ktichen is a neat art project located in Schenley Plaza.  This place has a mission to raise awareness of countries the United States is in conflict with (loosely defined).  They do this mainly through food-based outreach, but they also have a strong educational component that features interviews with citizens, handing over the reigns of their Instagram, film festivals, lectures, etc.

As is the case with every iteration of Conflict Kitchen, the food is delicious and unique in the Oakland neighborhood.  The kababs are solid options, even if they are a bit heavy on the herbs.  The Jujeh Kabab is my favorite of their current offerings.  I can also highly recommend the two Koresht-e dishes with a preference for the Khoresht-e Bademjan over the Khoresht-e Fesenjan.

The drink for the Persian iteration, Sharbat, is also good and much better than just a bottle of water.  The lime-flavored is the best of the bunch that I've had so far, but I doubt you could go wrong with any of the other flavors.  The halva's good but not something to get every time you go.  

This is one of my favorite places to get lunch in the city of Pittsburgh, or at least near where I work at Carnegie Mellon University.  Now that the weather is getting nicer and summer is here, I'll be coming more often.  One of my favorite things to do is grab lunch and then hang out with my friends and eat under the pavilion at Schenley Plaza.  It's a great break from the university life."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The place featured Afghan food and as someone that had no idea how to pronounce anything, the woman running the counter was super nice and helpful. The food was insanely good. Will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what an AMAZING concept! I am a huge fan and I wish we have a Conflict Kitchen in California! 

I forgot the exact names of the dishes but we order the lamb shank, lavash bread, and sharbat (strawberry rose water drink). Total was about $14. Most of the options were temporarily unavailable. 

The spices and sauce that came with the lamb shank was phenomenal. It tasted great with the rice. I just wished we were given more rice tbh. The bread was crispy and the drink was unique tasting. Still very good. 

The take out restaurant was across from a nice park with other food options. 

Yes and yes to coming back for more here!!"}
{"text":"Well well well, what do we have here... - Its Conflict Kitchen! Its such a shame that it took me such a long time time to try this hidden gem in the heart of Pitt campus. This hipster little stand is blessed with the graces of food from countries that the United States is currently in conflict with. Currently, Conflict Kitchen has Palestinian food--and I urge you to go get in on some of the action and have yourself a full blown food-gasm. Not only are you in for an educational experience about food from other countries, but you're also in for some pretty great falafel (deep fried chick pea goodness), Shawarma (tbh idk what it is but its **off the hook baby**) baba ghanoush with tahini (my personal favorite-- roasted eggplant dip), and mezzo, a delicious cheese plate. My falafel came in a thick, large pita with arugula, tahini, pickled beets, arugula, and tomatoes. Going back later today to get my daily fix of baba ghanoush because Idk if I've ever had such dank eggplant dip in my entire life. Thats how good this place is - I think I've gotten it five times in the past two weeks. They also carry authentic, top-notch olive oil imported from Palestine. Would love for them to offer samples of it and maybe some samples of that nutty delicious cheese plate they got back there. I'm just wondering when there going to start selling imported wine ;) Oh and the people that work there are so nice. This is the type of place I would bring on a hot date to show them how cultured/daring you are. Looking forward to the summer when they debut the Irani menu so I can get my daily dosage of noon-o paneer-o sabzi, kookoo sibzamini (the most bangin potatos you ever had in ur life), etc.. Iranian food is about to be pretty good-- kind of shame there closing the place down. I will never forget the amazing culinary experiences I have had at this place-- thank you owners of Conflict Kitchen for giving me such a groundbreaking experience! Btw-- just a food stand. Bring a blanket to sit down in schenley park to enjoy it, or sit at one of the little tables. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Love the conflict kitchen concept and its ability to actually spark conversations and rotating menu
Friendly and quick service
Now conveniently located 
Reasonable prices

Very delicious and flavorful \"fast food\" - and quite healthy too. Love the current Cuban menu

A memorable concept (one that works!) backed by delicious food! Thanks for moving to Oakland! :D"}
{"text":"The concept is great, the price is right (roughly similar to what you would paid in the other take out places on the plaza), and the food is often tasty (I may have had one or two bland dishes there) and usually quite good - at least for a take-out: Don't go there expecting fine dining. Tip: the seafood pancakes for the North Korean edition (on-going) are quite nice, although they are not light."}
{"text":"The food and service was great thanks a lot for the smile. Can't wait to come back and try it the next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"the theme here is that they rotate the menu to reflect cuisines of different countries the US has conflicts with . for now it is Iranian food.. kookoo e-sabzi is WONDERFUL!!! love Iranian food. sharbat drink is quite good also. prices are reasonable. sitting outside in the park is quite nice on those days when Pittsburgh has good weather (LOL). so yeah, it would be a lot better if they were in San Diego..."}
{"text":"This place is great! You have to go back each time  theychange the country and menu. My favorite thing about this restaurant is that they provide education in addition to food. The person taking my order challenged me to say one of items on the menu before it was correctly pronounced for me. Furthermore, there is typically a pamphlet explaining the conflict between the featured country and U.S. I've gone when the restaurant was serving cuisine from Cuba, Palestine, and Afghanistan. They offer entrees, desserts and drinks."}
{"text":"This place is located in downtown Pittsburgh, I had heard about it on the news and decided to try it while in town visiting family.

It is close to the Carnegie musemus and the Phipps conservator and the Chathedral of Learning. 

While i was there, they were searving the cusine of First Nations People. I had quail with salad with white corn bread. The quail was lovely as was the salad, the corn bread was a little too dense for my taste.

They give you a fold out with information about the wrongs that have been committed against the poeple of the first nations by the united states gov't, its interesting. 

There is seating next to the public green space or people take there meals back to their offices."}
{"text":"Delicious! This place is inventive and unique and they have so many vegan and vegetarian options! I could eat here almost every day!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time while they were serving Palestinian food, I got the Musakhan (I'm a vegetarian 95% of the time, but figured that I've heard so many rave reviews about the CK, it was one exception I could make). It was a toasted flat bread topped with roasted chicken, caramelized onions, sumac and toasted pine nuts. I also got the baklava. Both were divine, and I'll be returning shortly."}
{"text":"Wow, this was yummy, interesting and a great idea. We had venison and squab. The tiny bird was as tasty as it gets. Just delicious. The venison was also great; very gamey but that's the idea I think. Very, um, \"primal\". A massive haunch of *meat*, but tender and delicious. The salad with the squab was very tasty too, as were the potatoes.

Just a wonderful, fun, terrific find.

When we visited the featured culture was Seneca Iroquois. We were told Palestine is likely next up.

Seating is all outdoors so during the wintertime takeout into indoors is desirable!"}
{"text":"I think the previous reviewers did a great job with explaining the overall concept of the place, so I'll skip that part. 

The food was just okay and portions kind of small, but the unique concept compensated for all that. I had the pleasure of trying Venezuelan options offered at the time, which I was not very impressed with. However, the purpose of Conflict Kitchen is to educate and raise awareness, and I think they did a wonderful job with that. Service is incredible with super friendly staff. I highly recommend for the overall experience, not necessarily for the quality of food."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to go here when it was in East Liberty but finally made it down to the new Oakland location for lunch yesterday. They were doing Iranian food when I went and as far as I know will be doing this until at least June 2013. 

I had the Khoresht-e fesenjan, which was very good. The meat was moist and the pomegranate flavor was not overwhelming but added a good flavor. For the price, the portions are decently sized and I split my food into two meals. I also had the saffron ice cream sandwich and really liked the flaky wafers that were used. 

It was busy around lunch time and the staff seemed very nice and we got our food quickly. I'm definitely going to make an effort to get back to try more things on this menu before they change."}
{"text":"[WARNING: Visitor from St. Pete, Florida in for a short visit]
GREAT IDEA BUT A BIT HYPED = Essentially, this is an order-at-the-counter restaurant where the menu completely changes every week or so.  The dedication of the staff to be creative and learn new styles that often is pretty impressive.

CASUAL ENVIRONMENT AND FOOD = Remember--this is ordered and picked up from a window aka food in to-go containers... so don't expect the best plating nor anything too elaborate. Casual food. With that in mind, it was difficult for me to be WOW-ed by my dishes (Native American during my visit). My Venison Stew was simple and comforting in flavor BUT what my restaurant-spoiled mind saw was a watery stew with not enough chunks inside. The sweet Bread was tasty addition with great texture and subtle sweet flavor. I can't deduct much points for the food though because I'm no Native American food expert--a watery Venison Stew may have actually been authentic?

AS A WHOLE = Great idea and judging from other reviews and photos, it seems they do justice to the countries they represent. There's no tables, but feel free to join the throngs of students picnicking and studying in the neighboring park. 

Note: As someone with many allergies, a mention of common triggering ingredients would be much appreciated to the menu board. And perhaps a phonetic showing of how to pronounce the dishes?"}
{"text":"Last time I went they had Afghani food and it was very good. This time they had Venezuelan food. Had the cocoanut  goat with a sweet plantain mash and meat. It was very good. My friend had the pulled beef with plantains, beans and rice also very good. I like this place since they change it up and it's a perfect lunch portion for a descent price. Always good place to go after a nice walk or run in the park."}
{"text":"I love the restaurant, and the Native American-themed menu was really interesting, innovative and socially televant. However, I ordered the venison and the meat was rock-hard. At least I could save the marrow, the rest was nearly unedible. The gravy, berries and herbs were good. The sweet dumplings on berry sauce were simply AMAZING."}
{"text":"The concept alone behind this place is great: enjoy a meal from a place the nation is in conflict with, and at the same time learn a little about that place, i.e. its culture and why we're in conflict with it. But concepts alone don't make a place wonderful. Good food is a must, and fortunately Conflict Kitchen always meets that standard, too.

Personally, I've been a fan of the Conflict Kitchen for years, both for its concept and for its great food. I admit, though, I am glad they moved from their original location. Once upon a time when I wanted to eat here, I had to catch a bus towards East Liberty, stand as I ate, and wait even longer for the bus that would take me home - often in the cold. I didn't mind this as an adventurous student, but realistically that's not the dining experience most of us want.

Fortunately for me and all of Pittsburgh, the new location in Oakland is bigger and better - as is the menu; now you can order full meals, not just single items as I once did at their old location. Plus, their hours are less sporadic, the location is easier to access, you can usually find parking somewhere during most of the day (there are exceptions because of class and people working here, admittedly), and best of all, the Conflict Kitchen is no longer cash only, something I admittedly hated about their old stand since I never, ever carry cash.

Currently (though this may change soon) the Kitchen's delightful menu items come from Cuba. I have to say, a takeout box of shredded beef, rice and beans, and a salad was about as perfect a meal as I could have asked for. Everything tasted better than I can describe! Plus the weather was gorgeous: I just took my food, sat in the plaza, and enjoyed. 

Definitely loved finally vising their new location. I hope to be back soon and I cannot wait to see what they do next!"}
{"text":"Great food, location and concept although portion was a bit small. There's no question I'll be back."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Good prices. Encourages me to try new things. Worth the wait in line. Minus one star just because the menu is always changing so I'm not sure that I'll like it as much the next time."}
{"text":"Conflict kitchen, yes, I have eaten there quite a few times.  I used to work in Schenely Plaza their home.  The rotating theme is really awesome and they seem to float well from genre to genre.  I liked the Afghan food and the Cuban.  I don't even get to try these kind of foods very often, so it was a treat.  It makes sense that they do this for the countries we are at war with, but I wish they could stop all of the fights that break out randomly in the restaurant.  Just kidding!!!"}
{"text":"Food-wise, Conflict Kitchen is a solid 4/5.  However, add in the concept that the restaurant periodically completely reinvents itself to a new nationality under \"conflict\" and you have hit that garners national attention for good reason.

Most recently, Conflict has ventured from Cuba to Afghanistan to Venezuela, each menu comprised of small bites, entrees, sides and local drinks.  On this most recent occasion, my wife and I visited the Venezuelan setup to satisfy my craving for arepas and her obsession with empanadas...  needless to say, we were pleased.

My arepa was a welcome change from the typical hot cheesy deliciousness I usually crave.  Served cold with a chicken and avocado salad, this thing was a spot on bite for the blistering summer heat.

My wife's empanada, while divergent from all those we've have before, was delicious as well.  A much thicker dough and different consistency gave it a chewy kind of consistency that almost reminded me of a cross between an empanada and a tamale.

Overall, I can't think of a better addition to the cultural, age and political infusion that is Oakland.  It brings great awareness to the countries it represents (they conduct interviews and provide free pamphlets that highlight that region's stories, views of America, etc.) and it breaks that madhouse of Mexican, Asian and Indian establishments that litter the area.

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Food is great, location is great, price is reasonable.  And it's quirky as well.

One thing I will say is that you are at the mercy of whatever conflict cuisine is chosen at the time.  I ate there twice during Iranian, and it was great.  The Cuban I was not so fond of (nothing wrong with the preparation, just not a fan of Cuban cuisine).  And people still rave to me about Palestinian, but I wasn't around in that era."}
{"text":"Most people are already aware of the Conflict Kitchen concept (of serving food from places the United States are in conflict with).  It has received lots of praise and I understand why.  The menu rotates and great care is taken to understand the country represented and its people and politics.  Equal care is taken to reach out to said community in order to make sure the food offered is authentic.  

I stopped by with a friend on a cold winter's day when the country represented was Iran.  The menu wasn't as intimdating as I thought it would be, though we ordered food by the description because we didn't want to butcher the language.  We ordered a bit of everything to share: Kookoo Sibzamini (pan-fried potato and onion patties served with rice, herbs tomato and onion), Kabab-E Kubideh (ground beef and lamb kabob served with rice), Salad-E Adas (lentil salad).  I also noticed that they offered hot black tea with purchase.  It was freezing and we had to wait for our food but they would only give us one hot tea because we ordered all our food together.  And we had to ask for it, they didn't just offer it to everyone.  I was rather annoyed by this at the time.  And even more so once we got home with our food.

The food was not as flavorful as I expected it to be.  Even when the rice was eaten together with the herbs, tomatoes and onions it was still bland.  The kabobs weren't chunks of meat like I expected.  I also felt the portions were small when considering the price.  My favorite thing, surprisingly, was the lentil salad.

Conflict Kitchen has a great location in Schenley Plaza.  Maybe I'll go back when the menu and weather has changed and I can enjoy my meal outside.  This first time around, though, I just wasn't impressed based on all the hype.  

The concept definitely gets 5 stars.  The menu itself gets 4 stars.  The execution brings it down to 3 stars.  But not offering that extra hot tea on a cold winter's day?  I'll give it another try when there is a new menu available but I won't update my review unless the next experience is an improvement."}
{"text":"You've gotta love an original concept. And a tasty eat too. 

I would have preferred not to wear that sauce on my pants, but I guess that's what I get for trying to save that pretty paper it was wrapped in."}
{"text":"The concept is inventive, and the sandwich is great.  The Conflict Kitchen features a simple lunch from the cuisine of a country with which the US is in conflict.  The project started with Iran, and the seasoned beef sandwich served with onion, mint, and basil is worth a return visit.  I can't imagine a better $5 lunch.  You have about a month to enjoy it...!

The sandwich comes wrapped in an interesting paper printed with comments of Iranian-Americans.  I found a few of the comments dubious, especially about nuclear capability.  The comments appear without attribution, and I wish the authors were identified, since they are personal opinions.

I'm looking forward to the Afghanistan offering due at the end of September.  In the meantime, I'm going back for more kubideh before it's gone."}
{"text":"Unique food every time we visit. The staff is always very friendly and helpful....and very forgiving if you butcher the pronunciation on any of the items... Food is always interesting and worth a try if you're looking for something different."}
{"text":"It's been a couple years since I last ate at Conflict Kitchen, but given that I always end up recommending it to people when we talk about Pittsburgh, I figured I should leave it a review. Even after eating my way through San Francisco and New York, Conflict Kitchen is still one of the most unique places I've eaten at. I love the way that it brings forth the strong connection between food and culture, and that chefs don't misappropriate the cuisine of foreign countries through their own interpretation but rather take the time to travel and learn from the home countries. Their menu is usually pretty limited, but that ensures the quality of each item. In the past
I've enjoyed the tajada and empanadas during the time the covered Venezuela. They also give you a sheet of interviews from people from the country of conflict and immigrants in America that you can read while you eat in Schenley Plaza. 

Conflict Kitchen is about more than great food (which really is delicious); it embraces the deep relationship between food and culture and exposes people to food that they might never get a chance to eat. Because of this, Conflict Kitchen remains one of my favorite eateries in America."}
{"text":"Love love love Conflict Kitchen.  Low-key, affordable, DELICIOUS, thoughtful.  Sitting right in Schenley Plaza is Conflict Kitchen--now in stand form.  Right now they're featuring Iranian food, and everything I ate and tasted was knock-your-socks-off yummy.  Nice flavor combos, and nothing too overdone.  Simple, great food.

You can get food and eat it at a table nearby, or you can get food and stroll."}
{"text":"The newest menu at Conflict Kitchen features Native American cuisine from the Haudenosaunee Confederacy (also known as the Iroquois Confederacy), a league of six Indigenous nations primarily located in upstate New York with historic ties to Western Pennsylvania. 

We tried almost all of the vegetarian options and they were all delicious.  I particularly enjoyed the dumplings for dessert.  

This is a great idea to draw attention to the foods of the Iroquois, our modern diets owe so much to their recipes, for example cornbread and succotash are 2 of my favorites."}
{"text":"BEST Lunch EVER! Ensalada de Palmitos, Ceviche, Arepas, Tostones, jugos de Guanabana y fresa! Yum!"}
{"text":"A lot of  yelpers already discussed the concept of conflict kitchen so I will keep mine brief- the idea is that they only serve food from countries in which the us is in conflict with. Each time they change their featured country they have educational sessions and performances as well. 

The country I experienced was Venezuela. I ordered the tequenos with their house made fresh avocado salsa- oh my godd. Incredible. The order came with three and it cost me $3.50. They were basically cheese sticks wrapped in a crisp pastry - they are fluffy and filled with delicious melted cheese. The fresh avocado salsa went so well with the tequenos- they complimented each other wonderfully. I can't wait to return while they still feature the Venezuelan cuisine and try their other amazing meals- the twice fried plantains with their avocado salsa sounded epic, as did their featured deserts. The only downfall to conflict kitchen is it's take out only- although, it is located in scheleny plaza, so there are plenty of small tables as well as a grassy area to picnic :)"}
{"text":"Delightful little place to get some food outside of your comfort zone. Came here on a beautiful Saturday morning for an early lunch and got some great Palestinian food. They hand out some interesting reading material while you wait: interviews of people that live in conflict zones (conflict with the U.S.)"}
{"text":"Great food and concept.  I went when they had Cuban food and I was impressed with the taste and portion sizes.  I really liked the free Natilla dessert that came with it."}
{"text":"Conflict Kitchen is definitely one of the most unique restaurants in PGH.  For those unfamiliar with it, the concept is to serve food from countries with which the US is currently in political conflict.  It's run by students from CMU, who are happy to educate customers about the culture in addition to the food.

When a friend asked me a few months ago if I'd like to try it out, I jumped at the opportunity to do so, since I'd heard so many interesting things about it.  Never having sampled Iranian cuisine before, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Since I don't eat lamb (it's too close in flavor and texture to beef for me, which I also don't eat), I went with the qorma-e lubia, the one vegetarian option on the menu.  As a non-vegetarian, I'm often inherently skeptical of vegetarian dishes (I'm not a fan of tofu, generally), but it was surprisingly good!  I found it to be well-seasoned and savory, with a nice mixture of textures.  I also ordered the sharbat-e rayhan (lemon rosewater drink with basil seeds), and it was also surprisingly good.  If you like your drinks on the sweeter side, I'd definitely recommend giving it a try!  My friend ordered the kabuli palow (lamb w/ rice), and told me that she greatly enjoyed it, as well.

Since it was a nice day, we ate at one of the tables right across from the stand, which provided a great view of Cathedral of Learning and students tanning in Schenley Plaza.  I look forward to returning to sample interesting food from other cuisines with which I'm unfamiliar.  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I heard about this booth and wanted to try something different. 
It was Cuban food month. They have a video playing of an Obama impersonater talking about the Cuban conflict.  They also had a free poster pamphlet about the conflict. 
I already ate somewhere else so I decided to get a side dish. I ordered the plantains with a lemon garlic sauce and the Majarete which is corn pudding with cinnamon and nutmeg.
The food is fresh and made well with authentic flavors.
I personally didn't like the plain tasting plantains or the combo of lemon and garlic.
I would like to come back and try some of there flavorful entrees instead of just a side dish."}
{"text":"\"Just when I thought you couldn't possibly be any dumber, you go and do something like this... and totally redeem yourself!\"

Look, I don't think Pittsburgh is dumb at all, but outsiders may think that we're nothing more than a bunch of steelers-jersey-wearing, meat and potato eating city.

I love that places like Conflict Kitchen serve up a completely unique concept and breathe some edgy life into the city. 

While the concept is great on an informative level alone, it's also a great chance to try some food you otherwise may never encounter.

I recently stopped by for some Afghani Bolani's, and thought they were pretty tasty. That said, these things are expensive for what you get - but at a place like this I guess you're paying more for the idea than the actual food.

Regardless of how weird the food may seem, or the prices, I will continue to happily support this place due to the great idea behind it."}
{"text":"Tasty lunch for less than $10 close to the universities.  I read the political propaganda they passed out with an open mind and will reserve judgement.  However, just as I don't like Hilton to try to sell me a time share at the end of my stay I don't want political pamphlets with my meals.  In the spirit of free speech,  for which the US has always been the beacon, I don't mind establishments having literature freely available.  But as I buy my lunch on a site heavily subsidized by my tax dollars,  I don't wish to further subsidize any political cause even if it's my own.  I gave at the office."}
{"text":"I knew going in that this would be more art project than eatery. I'd read about it in the P-G, and NPR had picked up the story nationally. Conflict Kitchen's menu item changes every four months as it highlights cuisine from countries the U.S. is in conflict with. Right now, it's \"Kubideh Kitchen\" serving Iranian sandwiches. This fall, it will be food from Afghanistan. After that, who knows. (For what it's worth, there is no shortage of edible possibilities.) The project is intended to provoke thought. My kubideh came wrapped in a sheet containing information about Iran's culture and geopolitical situation. As the NPR story put it, \"everybody speaks sandwich\".

But here's the best part. What the news stories didn't let on enough is that my Persian sandwich would be *delicious*. The kubideh is ground beef topped with sumac, parsley, mint, basil, and onion, wrapped in barbari, a seeded flatbread. So tasty, and at $5, a bargain. (No, the ingredients weren't shipped from Iran. The bread is made from Latrobe flour, and the beef is from Ligonier.)

I'll go out on a limb and say that both Primanti's and the Carnegie could learn a thing or two from this place. And how many places could you say that about?"}
{"text":"The food is not as good as I was hoping that it would be, but it was still very good and the message makes it 4-stars. There is a lot of effort into making it a full cultural experience, which is very cool. The aqua fresca was also amazing, and only $2 for a small cup. The staff was also very friendly and knowledgeable about the food items. The concept of the restaurant is so cool, and I can't wait to see what kind of cuisine they serve nexxt."}
{"text":"Not only is the food outstanding, but the message is even better! No matter what we disagree about, we can reach each other as human beings on some level. To introduce cultures that we are in conflict wit through their food.. Brilliant!
Ending this week is the middle eastern flavor of Palestine.
Outstanding! Next week Cuba!!!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of Conflict Kitchen. It's a great place to grab a quick meal for a reasonable price, but I didn't love the food. The rotating menu is a nice change. I don't live in Pittsburgh but if I did I would probably have to try the new menu each time it changed. They were serving Iranian food when I stopped by. I ordered a beef kabab dish and walnut-pomegranate marinated olives. The olives were amazing. I found the beef kabab to be completely overcooked and charred. I could only eat half of it. The rice was also bland and overall it was kind of a small dish for the money.  Even though I wasnt pleased with what I ordered that day, I would still come back and try something else. I think it is quality food and an awesome idea all around."}
{"text":"Great idea for a restaurant, learn something while eating some amazing food.  We had the Cuban food and loved it!  Reading the stories gives an alternate perspective than I've had before.  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I came here after he did extensive research about where to eat while planning my surprise trip to Pittsburgh. We came upon the stand without any line, which was extremely lucky because right after we stepped up to the counter about 10 people were lined up behind us. They currently have a Palestinian menu (although we were told they would be switching to Cuban sometime next week) which was perfect because Boyfriend loves Middle Eastern food and I just love good food in general. After ordering we were given a poster with interviews the CK staff conducted with Palestinians both here and over seas - very cool!   

He ordered the Schwarma sandwich and hibiscus drink, I ordered the Kofta and potato platter and the lemonade, and we got the hummus to split. We sat down at one of the nearby tables in the sunshine with a view of the park and people-watched for about 10 minutes until they called our names. Soon, we had delicious, fresh food in front of us. The hummus was cool and delicious - topped with chick peas and olive oil and served with a warm, flat bread. I pried open my plastic container and saw big squares of kofta swimming with potatoes in tahini sauce. Absolutely delectable. No gristle at all. Just flavorful, juicy meat.  Boyfriend opened his sandwich and saw that he got falafel instead of the ordered Schwarma. Did he love it? Yes. The wrap was stuffed with perfectly crispy falafel, pickles and tahini. But it wasn't what he ordered. A little disappointing. This combined with the fact that the drinks were just okay gives what I would consider otherwise a perfect place to eat 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"I love the food here!! The menu changes every month depending on the country that they are representing.  So far I've only had two types: Cuban and I can't remember the other one but it was something with a lot of flat bread. 

For their Cuban food, I love the whole menu!! My favorite side is the sweet fried plantains and the empanadas. The staff is very friendly and prices are pretty reasonable. When it's nice, I like sitting on the tables under the trees. Absolutely love this place!!"}
{"text":"One of the best food shacks I've ever had. We came during the Native American menu and the food was amazing. The venison was served in a super savory acorn puree with a sprinkling of blueberries that didn't detract from the tone of the dish. The puree was a little congealed but the venison itself was moist, tender and not too gamey. We also got the quail which was lightly seasoned and roasted to perfection with light caramelization and moist pull-off-the-bone meat. Our biggest complaint was the portion size as there was maybe only 5-6 bites of venison and quail each, a little light for a $12-13 meal.

Overall Conflict Kitchen is a great place to eat and I love their message of cultural awareness and exploration of unique flavors. I plan on coming back and supporting them but will make sure to pre-game a snack if I'm starving."}
{"text":"I just attended an event catered by Conflict Kitchen - the current iteration is Iranian food. I love the concept, and I'm so glad I finally got a chance to try some. I've never had Iranian food outside of a friend's house...there don't really seem to be many Persian places around, now that I think about it :/

They really do their homework about the cuisine - this spread was on point, right down to the mysterious bowl of chopped herbs that has a place at every Persian meal. I had the Kookoo-e sabzi, a frittata with herbs and walnuts. I think the herb/egg ratio was a little high, and it wound up feeling kind of soggy (although that could be related to the fact that it was delivered and not served fresh). The walnuts are a delightful added bit of texture.  The rice was delicious (I love middle eastern rice), and the zeytoon parvardeh (think marinated antipasti olives but with a middle eastern twist) is amazing! Major props for pitting the olives.

This review is a little incomplete since I have no way of assessing price/portion size, but I was very happy with this meal! Given the chance, I'd stop by the actual place in person."}
{"text":"Lovely. Went here while on vacation back in 2011 when they had just started, to try their Cocina venezolana. I had an arepa de reina pepiada which is one of the most delicious and difficult to get right flavors of Venezuelan arepas. They nailed it. The arepas were cooked perfectly, abundant tasty reina pepiada (chicken and avocado and creamy sauce) filling and a spicy ginger beer. Great service and overall a fabulous concept. My brother will be moving close to Pittsburgh and I hope to make it back to the other iterations of the Conflict Kitchen when I visit. Lots of love from a Venezuelan in Iowa."}
{"text":"I love Conflict Kitchen.  The food is fantastic, but the downside is that the rotating menu means that you will find something you love and when the menu rotates you'll miss it for the rest of your life..... sad sad.  Then to make matters worse the cycle repeats its delicious self. 

Staff is friendly and apparently they're all dedicated lifelong learners.  If there's no line behind me its fun to talk about the places represented in their menu.  My favorites have been North Korean and Venezuelan.  I will never get over their shredded beef from the Venezuelan menu.  Its is like a lost love, I am forlorn.  Alas.  

Seating is outdoors in good weather, otherwise plan on take-away."}
{"text":"I knew after hearing about this place and its concept that I needed to go when visiting Pittsburgh. It is set in a beautiful park with plenty of seating in the shade or picnic on the lawn. Parking was easy (noticed plenty of street parking) but we walked from Phipps Conservatory. Food was absolutely on point and we were surprised by the large portions."}
{"text":"I was interested in the idea of eating foods from countries with which we are in conflict. On the day that I visited, they were serving foods from Iran. For my main entrees, I ordered the kookoo-e sabzi, which I give 3 stars, and the kabab-e torsh, which I give 5 stars. I also ordered the halva dessert, which I give 4 stars although it almost tasted like nothing, and the sharbat beverage, which I give 3 stars for tasting sour/bitter. I waited a long time to receive my food from the counter, because many customers were ahead of me in line, and the cooks cooked the food fresh."}
{"text":"Just tried their sweet guava and cream cheese empanada today. It was great, they were still making them when I ordered, so I got a nice hot one after waiting a few minutes. It was very sweet - the entire outside was coated in granulated sugar, the inside had a gooey filling. I'll definitely get it again and I still need to try out their real meals instead of just their desserts."}
{"text":"I am so sad to hear they been labeled as hateful and were forced to close. It's a very sad day when we can't agree to disagree, but still engage, share ideas and food and find peace among us."}
{"text":"I'd give Conflict Kitchen 5 stars, but as part of their creative concept for a restaurant they are serious about the authenticity of the dishes they make from various countries with which the United States has been been in conflict, and that sometimes entails serving not-so-tasty foods. But it's hard to fault them for that, really.  All I'm saying is you may love it one day but when you come back in a few months you might be disappointed because the menu will have changed to something you don't like as much, or can't eat. The food is great, authentic, and their associated pamphlets and research are enlightening and intriguing."}
{"text":"Like others have said, the concept of rotating food every few months for cuisines fitting a common theme seems to be a cool novelty. Not only do you get to try different food at the same location, they also make an effort to educate the public about these important global issues. That said, I think many would prioritize the food first, and that did not disappoint when we went to try the Venezuelan selection. It's impressive that they are able to keep up the quality of the food with so many different rotations. I wish I had come by earlier to try the other rotations. The only disappointing thing if you actually like the current iteration--it will not last for longer than a few months!"}
{"text":"What a cool idea!

As one might expect, the cuisines of countries with which we are in conflict are frequently under-represented in the United States, and Conflict Kitchen helps try to fill in that gap.  They do different iterations every few months, and the current country being represented is Afghanistan.  They've done Iran before, and it looks like Venezuela will be next.  

I gather there's more to this organization than just the food, but for hung-over lunch on a Sunday, I was unfortunately a little bit too ignorant-through-fatigue to pay attention to much else.  

The takeout window is an interesting layout that immediately gets you asking questions when you see it, and the menu is small in a wonderful way.  Having too many choices stresses people out, and Conflict Kitchen is therefore not a stressful place from which to order.  

The turnovers we had were damn tasty, too.  It may not be 100% about the food, but they definitely do the food right.  Options are potato and leek, spinach, and lentil.  All three were great, though there was a slight blandness to the potato and leek and the lentil. The spinach was really where it's at, though.  I'd pick that one if/when I do it again.

In the complaint department, well it's cash only, but they're such a small organization that I have trouble faulting them, especially because they're SO INCREDIBLY NICE.  Also, the hours are highly inconvenient for me, but they're there to do takeout for lunch, not serve at all hours of the day, and it may not be economically sound for them to be open much longer than that.

If you can make it while they're open, though, try it out and get a taste of something different.  I can't wait until the Venezuela iteration is set up."}
{"text":"The food is great and the concept is better. The restaurant features food from different countries the US has conflict with. Currently, the country focus is Iran. It's a great way to bridge the gap of understanding through food. 

I always am able to find food I like and it allows me to try something new and at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Right now, Conflict Kitchen is offering Cuban food. If you are wondering about their menu, it's all listed on the website. Once you order the food, you can grab one of their pamphlets that explain the history of Cuba and its relationship with the US. 

I got the Tostones- smashed green plaintains that are fried. They come with a side of Mojo sauce, which tasted like oil, vinegar, lemon and tons of garlic! I also got a side of hot sauce that was available on the counter. I also ordered the Ropa Vieja- stewed shredded beef vegetable stew. It came with a side of their Cuban Salad with Mojo sauce and Congri: the salad base was cabbage which I like, and Congri is their rice and beans, except in this Cuban version, the rice, beans, and veggies are cooked together.  All components were equally flavorful."}
{"text":"Six stars.  I am always on the lookout for restaurants serving food from different countries.  It has now become a challenge for me to find a place that serves food from a nation that I have not had the opportunity to sample.  But Conflict Kitchen has one of the most unique ideas I have ever seen for international foodies.  As the name implies, they serve food from countries that are in conflict with the U.S.A.  Clearly as time passes, they will only have more and more new options to serve up!  If that is not enough, there is a feel of a limited time only as the restaurant does not serve food from all of these countries at once.  They choose one and provide it to its customers only to then replace the menu with food from another conflict nation at another time.  While I was there they were serving food from Afghanistan.  Past offerings have been from Cuba and North Korea.  They plan to serve food from Venezuela and Palestine in the future.

When I approached for my first time I was not aware of the concept and all I saw was a sign for Afghanistan.  I was surprised when I looked inside the kitchen and did not see a single person that even resembled an Afghani.  However, when I talked to one of the girls inside she explained that their director actually travels to these conflict regions.  Talk about commitment.  Then he brings back authentic recipes to serve up in the kitchen.  Brilliant.  Furthermore, whenever a new cuisine is served up, they provide a taste test to Pittsburgh locals that were originally from that nation to receive their feedback.

The staff are students at the University of Pittsburgh and all are quite friendly.  They are happy to explain the concept of the restaurant.  Upon receiving your food, you can sit on the grass lawn or tables under the pavilion to enjoy the view of the Cathedral of Learning.

I wish that I had a restaurant like this where I lived which provides a revolving door of variety with international, authentic cuisine.  In the meantime, in my quest to try food from different countries, I can now say that I have sampled food from Afghanistan."}
{"text":"The concept behind Conflict Kitchen is really interesting. Other reviews go into it, so I won't. The week I went, they were serving Palestinian food; I got the musakhan (toasted flatbread topped with roasted chicken, caramelized onion, sumac and toasted pine nuts), and my friend got the chicken shawarma. 

+ Huge fan of the kitchen concept, rotating menu, and design of the stand. We each got these large wrapper papers that taught us about the culture of Palestine, and they were very thoughtfully done!
+ Both dishes were delicious and came out quickly! Very rich flavors.
- Portions were smaller than I expected, and I definitely wasn't filled up by the musakhan I got for $7.50. My friend's shawarma was more substantial, but also smaller than I've seen.
- Service was nice enough, but my friend ordered a bottle of water and they forgot to give it to him (even after he paid).
+/- It is a takeout restaurant, so outside seating is lovely on a warm day... unfortunately, it was cold when we went, so we ducked into the student union to actually eat. 

There were a lot of dishes that I would have loved to try on the menu. I would only go once in a while though, since the prices were a little high for me. I look forward to the menus coming up though!"}
{"text":"Bad Conflict Kitchen! I thought they had worked out their kinks with the persian food but they recently just switched to cuban food... and here we are again. The tostones were cardboard quality, the taro chips were super burnt, the three stews we tried were somewhat under-seasoned. I liked the green cabbage salad so they get two stars for that.  

I welcome the diversity, I am first in line for places that try to sell me food AND send a culturally poignant message. Seriously though it is a food place so serving very very oily burnt taro chips gives a bad reputation to cuban food."}
{"text":"I like the concept of this place. Despite America constantly being in conflict with other countries (when is it not...?), it helps to remind ourselves that people with their own identities and delicious cuisine live there too. That being said, I don't know if they represented the current country (Iran, as of the date of this review) well. 

I've been to quite a bit of middle eastern kebab places and they really do a good job with their portion sizes and the rice (which I think was tahdig). For the price, they were a bit skimpy on the portion sizes. Two of us got the Kabab-e Kubideh and one Kookoo-e Sabzi and it seemed like we were getting small appetizers instead of dinner portions. The kababs itself were good, and the Kookoo-e Sabzi ok. It says on the website that the rice is just steamed rice so I'm not sure if it was supposed to be tahdig. If it was just steamed rice, it definitely was underdone. It hurt my teeth to continue eat it. If it was tahdig, then it might've been a bit ill-prepared. I might want to try this place again when they have a different country, but it was a pretty average first impression they had on me. In summary, the concept is great but the execution (food) could be better."}
{"text":"I read a review from 2013 when Iran was the featured country.  I am writing now to tell you that it is March 2016 and the featured country is again, Iran.  Lucky me, I love Middle Eastern food! I ordered the Kabab-e Kubideh, which was a Ground beef and lamb kebab served with Basmati rice,  torshi makhloot (mixed pickled vegetables), lots of parsley and dill,tomato and onion.  Please make sure you include everything in your bite to get a massive flavor explosion.  You will be transported to Iran =)  for $8.50, I thought it was a steal. You get a free small cup of hot black tea which wasn't anything spectacular, but it's free so you can't complain.  Indulged in some Shir Birenj- a Creamy rice pudding with cardamom and pistachios. I appreciated the attempt, but I feel that the cardamom overpowered the dessert and the scattering of pistachios was underwhelming. What a great concept though.  I look forward to trying other conflict dishes in the future!"}
{"text":"Conflict Kitchen is such an interesting concept! Though I've lived in Pittsburgh for several years, I just heard of this restaurant for the first time this summer. The icing on the cake? They are currently \"Cocina del Conflicto\" and serving Cuban food. My grandmother was from Cuba, and since the Cuban cuisine options are very limited here in Pittsburgh, I was very anxious to try this restaurant before they took on their next conflict country.

The hubby and I tried the Picadillo, Ropa Vieja, Platanos Maduros, Marquitas de Yuca, and both the Passion Fruit and Hibiscus flavored Aguas Frescas. The Picadillo was tasty but not quite as rich and flavorful as how my family or I make it. However, it was a good representation of what the dish is, even if I believe that I can make it a lot better. My husband's Ropa Vieja was really good, and he quickly ate the small portion. The Platanos Maduros were a bit plain and lacking in sweetness; however, this may have been due to the seasonality or ripeness of the plantains used in the dish. I enjoyed the Yuca chips quite a bit, and they were very light and crispy. Finally, the Aguas Frescas were flavorful and worth the $2 price tag.

Overall, though I was a bit underwhelmed by the picadillo and plantanos (my two favorite Cuban dishes), I had a great experience and would come back. The website says that they will be cooking up food based on conflicts in North/South Korea and Palestine/Israel in the future. I'm already looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Love the concept, prices, and actual food!  It's a one-of-a-kind place that serves only foods from countries that the US is in conflict with.  Right now, they are specializing in Iranian cuisine, which features a delicious range of stews, meats, flatbreads, and sides.  I loved the kishik stew, which is filled with lamb, chickpeas, and rice, all in a creamy yogurt stew served with a pita flatbread which is great for soaking up the stew remnants.  Finish off with the orange and milk pudding, which is accented with rosewater, cardamon, and pistachios, for dessert.  Plus, you get free black tea!  It came to about $11 for everything, which made my wallet quite happy.  The portions are also quite reasonable, but simultaneously filling and satisfying.  Definitely a must-try in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Definitely have great prices and the food was rather tasty. The only thing I wish is that they had a few more items on the menu. Overall I enjoyed the food. The cuisine was Cuban"}
{"text":"The ever changing menu at Conflict Kitchen is one the reason I wish I was closer to PGH.. or at least visited more often. The concept absolutely fascinates me. A pop up that has a revolving menu, but always from a country we are in conflict with.

I was in the area last fall while Kubideh Kitchen (Iranian cuisine) was going strong, and well, this was on my list of must visit places. While I was partially concerned that I had built it up too much in my head that it wouldn't be as good as I had hoped, these fears quickly disappeared. 

It's not fast food, but I appreciate that. My friends and I all ordered our sandwiches and beverages. My beverage was a ginger beer that heeded a spicy hot warning. It hailed from Jamaica (not quite Iran).

That food was good. Let me tell you. We sat there beside it, unable to wait until we drove elsewhere to eat. I loved the research they did into the authenticity and the prices were very reasonable. The wrappers for the sandwiches have facts about the country as well as their relationship with the United States. They are so well designed I took a spare and still have it as a keepsake.

Bonus was that you could technically order vegetarian, though you won't get the full experience. Someone ordered a sandwich with no meat shortly after us, which meant bread and mint pretty much. They looked like they still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Underwhelming experience here. Great idea, I showed yesterday and the place closed early. No mention on their website, just a note on their window. Today we tried it again before heading back to Baltimore and like 30% of the menu was unavailable and there was no ice. No one thought to ask neighboring establishments for ice, nor did anyone make a trip to 7-11 for ice. The lack of initiative in the workers showed and is not a good look for this brand's image."}
{"text":"Just had the potato and leek turnovers and the sweet pumpkin with yogurt mint sauce. Wow. They were fabulous. The spicy sauce for the turnovers was in a separate container; it was also very tasty. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Perfect outdoor atmosphere for families or like us, with our dogs. The khoresht-e Hulu was so different and delicious!"}
{"text":"They've changed to Afghanistan!  At long last!

Now they serve bolani - which is like a pocket of flatbread filled with vegetarian deliciousness, and cooked to crispy perfection.  Last week when I stopped by, they had two flavors: spinach/leek, and red lentil - both delicious.  Especially the lentil.  They're going to have two more flavors soon (or maybe they already do) - pumpkin, and something else.  All vegetarian.  All made to order, hot and fantastic.  Rock on.  You can get one for $3, or two for $5.  One is enough if you are just a little hungry, or if you have other things to snack on during the day - two is a filling lunch, you won't need anything else.  And I haven't tried this, but a coworker said they don't reheat well in the microwave, so only order what you want to eat right then.

Go enjoy the inexpensive, authentic tastiness!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! My favorite so far was the Iranian food, though the Cuban stuff was great too. The Palestinian food is good. But more importantly, it brings to light the people who live in these areas and maybe what their lives are about."}
{"text":"Love this place for its mission and its food. We came during a week featuring Cuban food and had some pulled beef, yucca, and aqua frescas. Food came out quickly, customer service was top notch, and got some interesting reading done on the side reading up on the two-currency system in Cuba."}
{"text":"Love the idea of having rotating cuisines from various countries the US is in conflict with.  I was skeptical at first thinking it must be very challenging for a single staff to perfect so many myriad cuisines but they seem to do an excellent job. I've had both the North Korean and Afghan food so far multiple times and everything was excellent, nicely flavored, well prepared, and inexpensive.  The staff are all very friendly and excited about their cuisine and happy to answer questions.  There is some outdoor seating overlooking Schenley park.  They also include a pamphlet of education material about the country where the food originates.  I don't know much about North Korean or Afghan food personally so I can't say for sure how authentic it is but it seemed like they were making an effort to be as close as possible."}
{"text":"I knew we were going to love this place from the moment we bellied up to the ordering window - there are so many delicious aromas greeting their customers, it's no wonder this place was turning a good business, even on a drab and rainy day! We dropped by this afternoon after going to the Carnegie Museums because of all the great reviews we've read here. I must admit that the reviews were spot on. Fast and delicious, it definitely was. The Kubideh was delicious, and the khoresht-e fesenjan was a very tasty and filling dish. We really enjoyed the lime and mint Sharbat drinks as well.

Staff were extremely friendly, even letting us know that the carousel token vending machine was not working well and would likely just take our quarters without giving us tokens.

Overall, the concept is great - a sort of \"look what you are missing out on\" restaurant. Ah, if only the world would listen to Lennon, and have us imagine what life would be like if we could all get along. Hmmm. Until that time, I'm glad there's Conflict Kitchen - looking forward to this and other iterations of the concept. We are fans!

Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"You have to go here. It's not just food but an experience as well. Their mission is using food and art to facilitate conversations around the cultures whose food they're serving at that particular time. 

In all honesty, I give the Iranian food 4 stars, some of which was a little inauthentic, but I know they try very very hard to make it so. They change menus, so we can't expect them to hire staff from the same ethnic backgrounds as the food either. The food really was good tho, promise. 

In any case, we need more places like this in the world."}
{"text":"Such an awesome concept! I visited Carnegie Mellon for the weekend and was told that this place was a must try. At the time I went, Iranian good was being served.
I got the Jujeh kebab (chicken). The kebab came with steamed rice, mixed pickled vegetables, fresh herbs, tomato and onion. It was very flavorful and the portion was perfect for what I wanted at the time. Loved that they have complimentary black tea. It helped me stay warm while I waited for my food. 
Wished that this place had an indoor dining area, would have made it that much better. 
Overall great experience and if I'm ever back in Pittsburg, I will be making a stop here."}
{"text":"In addition to the wonderful concept and educational endeavor that is Conflict Kitchen, I have eaten here many times and never had a bad experience. Amazing food, amazing project."}
{"text":"Overpriced for how much is offered.
The food can be good or s and so, depending on the cuisine.
I definitely recommend the Cuban Cuisine, which is the latest trend. So far the best cooking."}
{"text":"Great place for trying foods from countries the U.S. is in conflict with. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"First of all, food should never be mixed with politics. Second, hummus served here is horrible. In addition, the food from the \"conflict\" places is not original. Falafel balls should not be small and dry and eggplant should not be so smooth."}
{"text":"I still like your bolani, Conflict Kitchen, but why do you never seem to have the pumpkin one? Of your other three flavors, I still love the red lentil one the best. But show me some pumpkin love, please!

The service can be a bit slow, since one person takes the orders, makes change, and comes back out with the food."}
{"text":"Amazing concept and quality of food. Not good or picky eaters who may not like the cuisine.  bibimbop was great although they skimped on sauce and toppings and added a lot of rice.  Great for small bites"}
{"text":"Passing through town and one of our planned destinations was Conflict Kitchen. Had heard good things.
First of all, love the concept! The food was good (chicken kabobs, and potato pancakes). Portions were a fair size, and the woman working there was just awesome. We'll stop there again!"}
{"text":"This is more an art work than a restaurant. Featuring foods by countries that US is in conflict with. The food is worth it and the price is nice. Its not always %100 same as the taste in those countries but going there once is not enough. They always have some drinks specific to tje country they are featuring at the time which is nice. They are infact friendly people but more importantly they always have some thing for you to read about that country."}
{"text":"Hello Conflict Kitchen how nice to meet you.... I had no idea you were located in Schenley plaza. 
 
I am just in the area for a little music and after the 8$ Gyro I wasted my money on at the arts fest I am looking for a date with a new sandwich. 

Kubideh? you say hmm ground beef, with herbs sauce and lettuce on a tastey fluffy flatbread? I am not a beef eater and I loved it for 6$ it hit the spot and I could still feel the weight of my wallet in my purse. 

Yummt Iranian inspired at this time but I hear the cuisine affair rotates, veggie and non veggie options to please the book bag toting masses. 

I will definitely be back this was just the pleasant surprise I needed. Oakland is full of surprises like that."}
{"text":"Yum! I've always wanted to try Conflict Kitchen, but it was impossible for me to go because of the hours they previously had. Now they're open for much longer hours (I THINK 11-6), and they're located in Schenley Plaza! Win!
I've gone to the Iranian one twice already since they opened in Schenley plaza....last week. Yes, I like it so much I've gone twice in one week! I tried a number of things within in my two visits. I got the vegetarian sandwich...I do not remember what it was called. It was delicious, though a bit messy. I also tried the yogurt dipping sauce. The yogurt sauce was delicious, but the bread was the real winner here. It is kind of like pita...but salty and sweet kind of. I saved half of my yogurt sauce and plan to go back and buy more bread for it today!
I also tried the bread with cheese and walnuts. The bread here was a little dry--not sure if it's different bread or what. It was kind of hard and flakey...not at all what I was expecting. It was not bad, but I highly doubt I'll get it again even though it was the item I was most looking forward to trying.
The fruit drink was good, but a bit small. It was only a dollar, I think, but I'd have been willing to pay more for a larger option.
For dessert, I tried the rice pudding. For those of you who know arroz con leche...it is not at all like that. It's not sweet, but it comes with I think some kind of cherry sauce on top of it. Mixed with the cherries, it was a pleasant dessert, but I still love me some arroz con leche with cinnamon a bit more!
The staff was incredibly friendly and patient with those of us who had questions about the menu. While they were not accepting cards when I went, they promise that they will be accepting cards soon. I was told they would be accepting cards by this week, but when I went yesterday they still were not. Make sure you bring cash, just in case. It is a little pricey if you want to try a bunch of different stuff, but the sandwich itself would have filled me up for lunch just fine. The problem was that I wanted to try everything!!!
Finally, the CONCEPT. It is the coolest concept, and I really liked the informative paper that came with my sandwich. I saved it so I can read it later! I really believe if we all understood each other just a little better, there would be so much less war and conflict. And really, what's the best way to get to know a culture other than to understand their eating habits and traditions. I cannot wait to try other versions of this restaurant. I am hoping they bring back the Cuban version, and I'd also like to see some more Latin American versions. Aren't we pretty much always in \"conflict\" with that region?"}
{"text":"The Cuban food this time around is ok, not amazing, but ok. I was expecting something different due to the hype. I could not order the beef dish since it was sold out. That should have told me to maybe wait for another day to try my luck. I purchased the pork dish and it was underwhelming. I do not know if it was just me but there was little flavor. The dish had pork and then rice and beans then a side salad. Since everything was thrown into a box together when I got to my seat it was all jumbled. The pork was mixed with the salad and the juice from both went everywhere. 

I went back to the stand and asked for some hot sauce. That really helped the dish. Overall I was not thrilled with what I got for the price."}
{"text":"Holy moly! I'm addicted!

I first heard of Conflict Kitchen back when it was in East Liberty, but I never got there. I think it's new location is brilliant. It's perfect for take-out food.

It's currently (July 2013) Cochina de Conflict, a.k.a. Cuban food. I freakin' love Cuban food. In fact, Pittsburgh should have a place for Cuban food, but I digress.

I got the congri, which is black beans and rice. You actually need a bit more black beans because the rice is supposed to be really black from the beans. Still it was good.

I also got the tostones, or fried plantains. These were excellent. If you've only had sweet plantains, you're in for a wonderful treat. I actually prefer them this way. They're salted like potato chips and served with a dip, and their dip is the perfect accompaniment. It was green and contained lots of garlic and black pepper. It was a bit sweet and citris-y--lemons or maybe limes? I actually poured a bunch of it on my congri because it was so good.

I sat down with my meal, and the woman at the table next to me said, \"What the heck are you eating?!?\" I told her. \"WOW! That smells so good. I wish I had known about that because I just ate. That looks and smells 1,000 times better than what I had.\" So there you go. A review within a review."}
{"text":"I had the Afghanistan food. a bit of a line but it was super nice weather. they handed out a cool pamphlet with information on the culture of the cuisine to read while you wait!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken kebab and had high expectations after constantly smelling the food when walking by. Overall, the chicken had flavor but was a little dry. The dish could have used a dipping or yogurt sauce. It was very filling though and I did not feel heavy or unhealthy afterwords. Looking forward to when the country changes."}
{"text":"The minute I realized that Conflict was a block away during my visit - no way was I leaving without trying something off their menu. By now - all foodie's have heard of Conflict Kitchen - it's like \"a thing\" that's been mentioned in almost all of the food-related subscriptions I receive. 

Decent portions, cheap prices, backed with an amazing concept. You just can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Interested in good food?  Check.
Interested in learning about another culture? Check.
Interested in something different? Check.

The arepas are pretty good but I've only tried the vegetarian (queso fresco) and vegan (black beans).  There's a chicken and avocado one that scares me for some reason.  I don't know if it's because they're served cold or what.  Each arepa is $5 (cash only).

Why no five stars?  Because you have to stand and wait outside while they make it.  This would be fine during the spring and summer but as the temperatures are starting to drop it scares me to think of standing outside for close to 10 minutes while waiting for some food that I'm going to have to eat either outside, in my car, or wait until I get home.  

Oh, and they're only open 11:30am-2pm. I will be coming back every time they change their menu (I think every season it's a new country) but I may skip it in the winter."}
{"text":"Went here while they were serving Cuban food and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, given the lack of good food around the university and it being rather inexpensive. On a nice day, you can take your food and sit at the tables in the park. The food is always changing and a really great deal for the money. I highly recommend giving them a shot for lunch and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Unique spot to grab a quick meal. They change their menu periodically to highlight the food of a particular culture, and they have videos playing to teach you a little about the peoples while you wait for your order.

It is not a restaurant but just a take-out counter out in the park, so you order, wait about 5 minutes, and find a place to picnic or grab a table under the large canopy nearby. When we visited, they were offering Cuban food and going by cocina conflicta. They had 4 entrees, two drinks, two desserts, and a few sides to choose from. I went with the pork, which came with rice, beans, and a side salad. The food is not spectacular but definitely solid for fast food, and reasonably priced. We enjoyed our meals and would love to come back when they change up the menu.

Bonus points for $1 bottled water."}
{"text":"It's a great concept. So much of culture is expressed with food and it is a great cultural experience. The food is really fresh and interesting. The staff is do polite and friendly. The outdoor seating is very relaxed. Over all a really pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the lamb shank. And the drink was interesting and authentic. Very filling for a low price!"}
{"text":"This is the best concept for a restaurant I've seen in Pittsburgh (or a lot of cities) in awhile. First, you should read all about it on their website and then follow it up with a visit. They showcase a different country who is in conflict with the US and represent peoples of that culture to explain what is going on within the country itself. Currently they are featuring Iran and boy, the Iranian food tonight was slammin. I had the KooKoo Sibzamini and I wish there was just ooooone more patty of onion and potato. It was awesome! My friend had the Mast-o Laboo and mixed it with her kebab and loved it. They also hand out a little pamphlet of information on Iran so you can learn more about it. Keep it up, y'all."}
{"text":"I love the concept for this place and the food is generally very good.

Currently the theme is Native American cuisine. I tried the venison entree, wild greens salad, cornbread, baked beans, and dessert dumplings in berry compote/sauce. Everything was delicious - especially the venison which just fell off the bone. I loved the baked beans, too, with the meaty chunks of bacon. The salad was just okay, but everything else was a little more unique and very tasty. Definitely check out Conflict Kitchen for this food right now!"}
{"text":"Oh my! I haven't been here in awhile. I came here today for Iranian food, it was amazing! I got one of their main dish that's chicken with pomegranate marinade. I love it! And I got their almond Persian cookies for dessert! My stomach was happy after that :) I definitely want to come back and check out other cuisine they have."}
{"text":"What an amazing concept. I've had foods from so many countries and nations because of this endeavor. Another place that helps make Pittsburgh great by bringing understanding through the one thing that connects all humans; food."}
{"text":"Had their Persian food, a fairly sweet chicken dish with some herbs adorning it. I'm not well-versed in Persian cuisine but I did enjoy the dish; it's a bit pricey at nine bucks but enjoyable."}
{"text":"I love the original concept of this take-out stand!

My husband read about Conflict Kitchen and insisted we try it during our Pittsburgh visit. I was extremely intrigued, especially when he told me the menu is constantly changing and we may have the chance to try a crazy new ethnic dish. 

My one disappointment: after nine years living in FL, Cuban food had become a standard dining option in my life. Man! I was hoping for a dish from Syria or Iran - something I would more than likely have no opportunity to try elsewhere. It was bad timing on our part.

However, I DO appreciate a quality meal and there was no way we were leaving without trying Conflict Kitchen. I was not disappointed! I ordered the Yuca con Mojo, a Cuban dish I had never tried (score!) and it was GOOD! The dish was very fresh and flavorful. My husband ordered the Picadillo (ground beef with olives, peppers, raisins and tomatoes) and ate every last bite. Good stuff!

I can't wait until our next visit to Pittsburgh and (hopefully) a new menu to try at Conflict Kitchen!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went for lunch here one day after church. We were very excited because we love cuban food and the fact my wife is part cuban adds to our love for the food. I feel that Conflict Kitchen did a fairly good rendition of many of the Cuban dishes we tried . 

They have a few entrees and sides choices which we ordered a few of each. Two meals and two side cost us about $23 which isn't bad and was plenty of food. Even though my wife's picadillo is better than that of Conflict Kitchen I give the restaurant two thumbs up. 

Also the fact that they change the food based on countries under conflict is pretty unique. If they stay true to the foods of other ethnic groups as they have Cuba it will be worth it to visit here whenever they switch countries and then some."}
{"text":"this place closed!!! it is now mesa mexican cuisine. very disappointing!!! I came all the way from Chicago to try this place out. Still shows up on maps, still has a website, and still on here. I hear that its because of threats and bad publicity that they closed. People need to calm down!!! I hope they decide to open this concept in Chicago!?!?!"}
{"text":"Where is the sixth star.
No joke.
This place is doing everything right - they're doing it because they give a flip, they're using mad skills and ACTUALLY TRAVELING to perfect their recipes and delivering the best product possible. And boy, is it yummy. I've had the Persian and Cuban iterations, as well as taking part in a live SKype meal with Tehran over a full-course, home-cooked Persian meal that blew everyone's mind (the talk? the food? THE GRAMMAR? Let's just say all of it!).
Please live forever."}
