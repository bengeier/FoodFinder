{"text":"Absolutely best place to get Sushi! They are busy when they have special events but we always get great service. Everyone there works so hard to make sure the customer is happy. Every roll is amazing and the food is always fresh. I've been going there for years and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"My significant other and I love sushi- specifically sashimi. We travel around the Phoenix area searching for the BEST Sashimi. I'm going to say, after many experiences with other sushi restaurants, Sushiya has the best Sashimi in town. Check out my pictures if you don't believe me- great cuts, so fresh, great marinade, and super presentation. We don't need wasabi or soy sauce when we go to Sushiya.  Don't forget the rolls! The rolls are fantastic as well, from the ones we've experienced- the Saemon Roll, Jackie Rolls, Las Vegas Rolls. They all have great complex flavors and just enough sauce.   The only things I've noticed in regards to improving service fluidity: Their combos are a bit confusing. We're still not really sure what is going on with the menus- what is more cost effective- or what comes with what. I'd love to see a revamp of their menu to make it more coherent (but that costs money, so it's not a big deal ;))  This place has fantastic sushi and deserves more praise for it's sushi. They obviously know that they're doing. The service is not bad; however, the shop is so tiny, mom-and-pop, that they sometimes look overwhelmed so service sometimes falls short. If every patron could be patient with the servers and the food- that would be ideal; they do the best they can, consistently, with the small space they have.  So overall: This place is going to make me go broke because I want to go every week to consume massive amounts of delicious sashimi. YAY!! :)"}
{"text":"The sushi was good but the service wasn't that great. There was only one waitress and it wasn't even busy but he still managed to suck."}
{"text":"Had sushi here last night after we found out our previous sushi place closed down.  There's a nice atmosphere and ambiance in the restaurant.  The rolls were delicious and they have a couple happy hour specials that are very good. Spicy actually means spicy over here.  I think we found our new -regular- sushi place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened and I will go no other place for sushi! Sung, the owner, runs a great business and is very personable with all his customers.  Staff is awesome and of course the sushi is amazing!!  Prices are great as well! Support your small, local, family owned businesses!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a great sushi restaurant for a long time, and this is it! They have the best happy hour specials and prices. The sushi is always fresh and the employees are nice. I am giving it  4 stars because most times it takes a while to get all of our sushi rolls. Otherwise, I love this place and will continue to dine frequently."}
{"text":"I've been here twice this week and I plan on returning often. The sushi is the best value I've ever seen. Not only is it presented beautifully, it is really good and very reasonably priced. The miso soup is thick and the edamame is boiled to perfection. This place is relatively close to my work, so I'm planning on going in for lunch often.  It hasn't been very busy at all either time I went in. I'm happy with the quick seating and service, but I hope they get enough customers to stay open. The owner is incredibly nice and has thrown in a free fruit plate dessert both times I went in. I highly recommend this place. Maybe I'll see you there!"}
{"text":"Sushi was great! Tried 4 different rolls  Phoenix roll-8  Arizona roll- 8 pile of crab on top was great Spicy Tuna roll- tons of tuna on top Jalape√±o roll-9 delicious and first to be finished We would most def come again!  Service wasn't super friendly but attentive so for that I took away a star"}
{"text":"Very family oriented atmosphere and had neighborhood vibe because 90% of the guests warmly knew owner by name.  Salmon sushi was delicious because nice portion size and was buttery and fat. Decent happy hour prices and food items on special. Do not order the chicken katsu !!!  It was pounded so thin that it tasted like pork jerky. And I think oil they deep fry in needs to be changed out cause it tastes old. I gave three stars because of chicken katsu but otherwise sushi rolls and sake were good. They do monthly discount specials so call in to ask or check online."}
{"text":"Great little Sushi place - I enjoy the atmosphere as much as the fresh, delicious fish. Courteous and caring service."}
{"text":"I come here 3 times a week at least. It's fantastic!!!! Arizona roll is amazing and their sashimi is always so fresh and large cuts. They have an awesome happy hour. I can never get enough of this place. Come early, they get busy!"}
{"text":"We are sushi lovers. And we are definitely not fans of the sushi place. Doesn't seem like they put any heart into their food it just seems likeThe same thing is you would get anywhere. If that is what you're looking for in this place will be fine. But we always like to find unique places that serve unique food that parties in your mouth."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in the area, nice staff, good service"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying our Geisha roll and Albacore roll were INCREDIBLE! I will definitely come back just for those. Our dumplings were also yummy but the California and crunch roll were both small. We also waited a while for our food but overall it was a great dinner and the happy hour deals are great."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi place! Large portions, good prices and friendly service. The quality of the fish is outstanding."}
{"text":"Great food! New staff horrible!! They can't speak English and they clearly have never worked in a restaurant before. You are lucky if you get the one white server that works there."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house. I was one of their first customers years ago when they opened. But I can surely say, I won't be coming there again nor would I recommend this place to others. They would not take my reservation when I called, but when I got there, the table of 7 I needed was reserved. They made me wait for another table for 20 minutes eventhough they had a table available as the reserved party was late. So, even though I was there first, they wouldn't give me the reserved table, but Sushiya supposedly do not take reservations. Be consistent!  The horrible and discriminatory service are not worth the happy hour, folks. Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving them one star is because I have to. The service was awful and it took so long to get our sushi. We kept having to walk up and grab our server to get her attention as she was behind the counter not doing anything. And they forgot our wasabi and ginger. They didn't fill up our until the very end, and we kept having to ask for things we shouldn't have had to ask for. And when we were ready for a check, she never came. So we had to ask the sushi chef to grab her and give us our check. Then when we were ready to pay, we had to walk up and give it to her as she was behind the counter not doing anything again. And mind you we were the only people there. We will never come back again."}
{"text":"Our car club usually dines here at least one Thursday every month.  We love it! There is cooked food options for the younger kids, great sushi options for us older kids, and a pretty good happy hour menu.   (I also love that they have vegan options for the two veggies in the group.)  The service is kinda crappy, but we are a pretty laid back crowd."}
{"text":"I am feeling a little bit protective of this place after reading some of the more negative reviews. My husband and I have lived in Chandler for over a year, and this is THE ONLY sushi place we will go to.   I have never had a bad experience. In fact - I have always felt very welcomed and well taken care of - even with my one year old... which doesn't happen often when we dine out.  Sung - the manager saw me feeding my daughter some of the avocado from my roll. Without hesitation, he grabbed her a side dish of a healthy portion of avocado!! I was so shocked he did that without my even needing to ask.  I was even MORE surprised that I was not even charged for it! When restaurants nickel and dime for every morsel of avocado, this was a delightful surprise.  I have never had my cup go more than half full before a sweet server will ask if i'd like a refill.  I love Sushiya - I will continue to be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I tried lunch specials combo rolls. So delicious. The price is also reasonable. Great!!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazingly fresh sushi!! The smoked salmon and jalapeno roll is our favorite! This place has the best portions for the money and the atmosphere is quaint. We've been here frequently in the past year and have seen a few changes. Some good, some not. Our favorite server appears to no longer work there. She was the one we always went to see on Sunday evenings.  :("}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant! I eat here at least once a week & it is always fantastic. The tuna tower & sunrise roll are the best. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I have been here many times now, and never had a bad experience! My boyfriend and I are becoming regulars, I suggest this to anyone who likes sushi!  Must try the Arizona Roll and their Las Vegas Roll :p"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for 5 yrs! LOVE the sushi and best happy hour choices ever!!! Amazing gyoza's, my favorite there! Family friendly place, check them out. Happy hour prices end at 7pm! Bonus!!! :) Owner is very friendly and hard worker, sushi chefs have been there for 4 yrs or so, that's great to see it's the same chef everytime! :)"}
{"text":"This place was our Friday night hang out for two years. It's always awesome service, and one of the best sushi places in the valley. A year ago we moved to San Diego. We just moved back to the valley and came here for dinner tonight.  A year later, the hostest still remembered us. It does get busy here, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is my daughter's favorite restaurant.   The owner is very nice and always visits our table and takes a personal interest in our lives.  The Sushi is always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I am very glad to see that a lot of people like this place. We have been going there almost since it opened and we love it. The service is great, very friendly and fast. The Sushi is fantastic. It is quite reasonable in price also. Compared to Blue Wasabi. We love the spicy calamari also. If you make it to happy hour, you get really good deals.  We have been going there regularly for years now."}
{"text":"Food is exceptional. Fish is fresh. Drinks are cheap. A little slow sometimes, so have a drink and chill."}
{"text":"For Off the Beaten Path, it is amazing! Great service! Sushi chefs will cater to what you like...owner is always happy and up beat  Remarkable Happy Hours"}
{"text":"Great sushi. I am a fan of the happy hour and the amount of sushi that gets brought to the table. My favorite roll has to be the atomic roll and the phoenix roll. Very tasty. I would give this place more stars if they had a better idea of proper service. Most of the staff doesn't seem to know the product- beside the amazing sushi chefs. Every waitress I have encountered looks like a deer in headlights when I have asked questions about the products. Not to mention, they do no buss their tables. I sat with six dirty plates on my table while eating my dessert. Usually when I walk in there are dirty tables left untouched for quite some time. I even commented to my friend that if given the opportunity I would train the staff myself about proper service and etiquette. I have faith that this place could be a five star joint, if only they would improve on the simpler things. Good luck Sushiya."}
{"text":"Sushiya is a great little place. The sushi is always fresh and tasty. I really enjoy the ladybug roll and the caterpillar roll. Their sashimi is great as well. The owners are so nice and always stop by my table for a chat. Perfect neighborhood sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing food even better company with Nick at the bar!!  Never ever disappoints!!  I went there for my birthday lunch and probably had the best roll I've ever had. Can't remember exactly the name I think it was the D & T roll. Massive and worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after it was suggested from a coffee barista.  We happened to go during happy hour.  They have a great happy hour menu.  We tried 3 different rolls and they were really good. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Just dined here tonight for Mothers Day.  I'm from NJ and accustomed to having good to very good food at almost any establishment.  Having been in AZ for 2 years, I can literally count on one hand the number of quality restaurants I've found. Once again I was fooled by the ratings; the sushi was supermarket -quality at best and although the server was nice, she came once and only once the entire time.  Same drink beginning to end. Dishes came out one by one.  The bottled Asahi was the highlight and I could have saved myself 70 bucks and picked one up at Bashas. One and done."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for SUPERIOR sushi in the East Valley! My wife and I went to Sushiya on a Thursday evening last week. They say you know a place is great when their are lots of regulars and this is that kind of place. The running joke was that this place is like \"Cheers...where everybody knows your name\" (we were the newbies). The guy next to us at the sushi bar has a history of frequently this establishment 3 times a week!!! The prices are very good and the quality is OUTSTANDING. We had shashimi and some rolls. The shashimi was the largest  portion cuts of fish I have ever received. The chef was Nicholas and he was a wonderful host and a talented sushi chef. We tried a chef special with Smoked Mackerel and it had an excellent balanced combination of flavors. We finally found our new favorite sushi place. Our old favorite is Mido Sushi in Chandler, but Sushiya blows them out of the water!!!"}
{"text":"I tend to be somewhat of a \"sushi snob\" so I was completely surprised when I found the best sushi in town in a strip mall (no worries, the interior of Sushiya is sleek and modern).  I highly recommend the sashimi...very fresh; large portions.  I also LOVE the Tigereye roll...tuna, crab with jalapeno - fabulous!  The squid salad is delish too.  The owners are very friendly and truly appreciate the patronage.  The prices are very good as well (especially at happy hour, i.e. $1.00 edamame, $3.50 california roll)."}
{"text":"Came in town for work and craving for some sushi. Found Sushiya Sushi on yelp. Went during a week night and it wasn't crowded. The waitress seated me immediately. Ordered a hot tea and some sushi. The food came out quickly. The fish was fresh and descent size but it also had a lot of rice. That's not the issue. The main issue was the rice didn't have enough vinegar and was not sticky enough. So the combination of the fish and the rice was not that satisfying unfortunately.  Overall, it's ok. Not excellent but not horrible either."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi with fresh ingredients, lunch combos with a reasonable price, excellent presentation and quick service for lunch break. The tuna tower was wonderful, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great sushi, with a nice roll selection and pictures of all the food on the menu, a definite plus. I lived in Japan for 4 years, and this place holds pretty true to the japanese way of doing things as far as a restaurant goes. The service was a bit slow, but I could see they only had one sushi chef, and I appreciated his taking his time to do each piece right. I would give it 5 stars, but the sake selection wasn't too good, which to me is an important piece to the sushi experience. If I am in the neighborhood, I'll have no issue going there again."}
{"text":"food was great. I had the crunch roll, dragon roll, and salmon roll. It was amazing and happy hour was decent too. Overall great atmosphere. I have been to many sushi places in the valley and this one is near the top of the list."}
{"text":"THE BEST, Coming from San Francisco we are spoiled with fresh Sushi, this the best place for Sushi I have had here in the Gilbert and Phoenix area. When we have guest we are off to Sushiya. never disappointed! Go at least 3 to 4 times a month, the chef is so good to watch . very fast and everything is plated and served perfectly. Never have had a bad experience there! Since I wrote this original revue we have been back 25 times, last time day before Thanksgiving, busy but had a table, was there with 5 friends from the bay area. They could not believe the quality of the food, in San Francisco would have $155.00, here was only $92.00 less the $7.00 coupon from the web! Great bargain, good food reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great happy hour prices and the sushi is awesome. Staff is always super friendly. We visit at least a few times a month."}
{"text":"We dined here for the first time on Saturday. It was ok. Not great, not awful, ok. The prices were decent, I thought, but they also have coupons on their website so check that out.   We had the Gyoza to start which had a nice texture and subtle, but good flavors. It was a little oily but, hey, they are fried so it's to be expected. We ordered a bunch of different rolls and some were good, some were ok, some were disappointing.  My favourite was the ladybug and the sriracha/sweet sauce on the plate. I loved that spiciness with the tuna! Yum!! We also had the caterpillar and dragon which were just meh. The spicy salmon was disappointing because it had zero spice to it. We should have asked them to make it more spicy.   The sushi rice was inconsistent. On some rolls there was way too much, on some it wasn't wrapped tightly enough so it fell apart and on some the texture was way too gummy and gooey.   I would like to try Sushiya again and try some different rolls, specify spicy and maybe try some other things on their menu because it's awfully close to my house and the prices were decent. Not a bad place, but not really that great, either. Just meh."}
{"text":"I guess I am one of the few that doesn't care for this place. It's busy, small, and a loud kid is very noticeable.  The hubbiend I had made our quarterly get together w an old friend at Sekai a few weeks previously, so we went non sushi. Got king crab soup. The base of the soup reminded me of the evil jungle princess at Thai Rama, so yum.  But for $6 I would have liked more crab. The chicken and shrimp fried rice, not so good. (I was wanting a comfort dish).  Hubbie's chicken teriyaki kind bland w a nice helping of vegetables. The rest of our group got sushi. Portions looked large, but it just did not look appetizing to me. This was our second visit to Sushiya and I don't believe I will go back. Sekai is first choice and I wouldn't mind another visit to Masa."}
{"text":"Great place. Picked 5 different plates with a friend. First time there and they rocked it perfect. Wide selection as well. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Sushiya exclusively since 2012.   Every time I come in I'm promptly greeted (sometimes personally, depending on how recently I had been in) and seated almost immediately. I've tried nearly every item on the menu and have never been disappointed by the choice of cut or composition of a specific role.   I've recommended this restaurant to every individual who's ever asked me to recommend a sushi joint - even to people asking in another city (IT'S THAT GOOD).   I'm a loyal customer for life, as long as I can be."}
{"text":"I went there the other day and must I say, their rolls are delicious! I'm a sushi lover and this one is currently in my top 5. Their rice is the right consistency were it won't break apart and isn't too soggy or too dry. The roll i got was the Rainbow roll and the fish on top was delicious. The roll was well balanced. I also got sashimi. The sashimi was fresh even though it was already late into the night. It didn't have the fishy smell. I would've given a 4.5 star but the dessert Strawberry mochi didn't taste right to me! (You also can't do that) Other than that, i would give the sushi a 4.5 out of five!"}
{"text":"The owner and staff is are super attentive and we love going here for date night.  Sushi is always fresh and so packed full of flavor.  Nice smaller restaurant and great location close to home.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Seriously best sushi intown!! I am obsessed with the double spicy roll with fresh jalapenos on top!! Always a great meal here!"}
{"text":"Being from Seattle I am pretty picky about sushi. The rolls were good, nothing super exciting. But as weird as it may sound they do have a really good chicken teriyaki (which I have struggled finding since moving to Arizona). However this review is based on the sushi and service experience. Little expensive for what it is..."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place since we live down the road.  We are used to sushi on Maui, having lived there for 12 years, so we are pretty picky.    The service was fast and friendly.  LOVED the spicy garlic edamame.  Now the sushi....eh.  It was just ok.  Price was high and not much taste."}
{"text":"Good soft shell crab, I thought the sashimi was good and fresh. Wish they could have done more with the squid or ika. Unagi was good but not great."}
{"text":"One of our favorite neighborhood sushi restaurants. The food is really fresh and the sushi chefs are always friendly and chatty! We go at least once a month. And choose Sushiya over the other two sushi restaurants that are much closer. Get the geisha! It's our favorite!"}
{"text":"Sushiya has excellent sushi made with fresh ingredients. I love going to Sushiya  with my family the sushi is delicious and the owner and his staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sushi fan but this place was great! I went with a couple of people and they really enjoyed it. (They are sushi fanatics) The sushi was awesome and we ordered alot of rolls. The staff was awesome too. Our sushi chef was great. The desserts weren't bad either : )"}
{"text":"Miso, edamame, tempura, California roll were great. The spicy tuna and spicy hamachi were so poorly presented that we couldn't finish it. It tasted great but looked like someone dumped a can of cat food over a California roll. Yuck! Maybe rethink that spicy tuna or hamachi on the outside - seems like a shortcut that just doesn't work."}
{"text":"I love the sushi I just hate the poor customer service I receive when picking up my to go order. The sushi is worth it so I go back lol"}
{"text":"This place is the best sushi place I've found in the Gilbert area so far... Prices are fair, and the food was good.  Great happy hour and reverse happy hour menus, and friendly staff.  Its a bit small inside, but I like sushi places like that.  For a more accurate rating, I'd give it a 4.5/5 if yelp would allow me to do so... because its not the most amazing sushi on the planet, but definitely solid and worth the a visit.   I can see this place turning into MY local sushi stomping ground... I just wish it was closer to my house!  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Yanagi Sushi is much better. They have great tasting sushi and service is very fast. Happy Hour is great at 4.00 Sushi Rolls and very very quick service and right on top of customers. Try them instead of Sushiya."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good sushi option. The asu roll is a household favorite. We've been here about a dozen times.  Super consistent. Service is good too."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Definitely loved the popcorn shrimp roll!  Everything was AMAZING!  Crunch roll,  rainbow roll and Chicken Yaki Udon - great flavors and EXCELLENT service. We will be driving down here for sushi again!"}
{"text":"We eat sushi once a week, came out here on vacation, and glad we found Sushiya! Food was very good and had great Happy Hour deals! I have never seen a Sushi restaurant serve as fast as they did! literally got apps 2 min. after ordering,and Rolls came out before our apps were finished! Many times we find ourselves sitting waiting for the main course,not here! Miso soup was a little salty."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I always get the Arizona roll. I refuse to order anything else because I love it so much! There is a server there named Lexi who is just the nicest and most attentive person! She always checks on us multiple times and greets us with a smile. I always love to go when Lexi is working."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the service. We waited by the door for at least 5 minutes before someone attended us and gave us a table. There was no sign to indicate whether or not we seat ourselves. Once we got seated, it took forever for someone to take our order, only to take over 30 minutes to get our food. This was on a Tuesday night too. The food was not too bad for the price as we went during happy hours, but it definitely wasn't the best. The cups that contained our waters looked dirty."}
{"text":"Great price and even better sushi. Thick cuts and delicious sauces! Try the double spicy!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly, and the place is an amazing place to eat or take a date. Our waiter, sierra was really helpful in helping me pick out my sushi, and was really sweet and efficient. I recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Service is good and food is okay. When we order the sushi platter, 25% of it are pieces we don't particularly like."}
{"text":"Loved the Arizona roll but the spicy tuna roll left something to be desired. My first time at the restaurant was a bit weird and the wait staff could've been a little more helpful. There was a dead jellyfish in the tank that looks like it could've been dead a few days or more as it was turning brown and had slime or spit-like residue surrounding it. The tank is not well kept and the fish seemes like they were starving...Overall it was a decent experience but I will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in the east valley. Friendly service, super comfortable - and the food is incredible. The green mussels are some of the best I've ever had. My only suggestion is a better sign - because you guys deserve to be way busier than you are on a Friday night. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"#1 best sushi!!! Great atmosphere, great service and great food! Mr. Yoon the owner is awesome and  adds an incredible personal touch to your dining experience!!!! Highly recommend the Geisha Roll!!!"}
{"text":"Having moved to the state a year ago, we were saddened and missing our favorite neighborhood sushi restaurant we left behind. After trying a few around the East Valley, we stumbled upon Sushiya -- and have been regulars since. The sushi is wonderful and fresh. The prices are very modest. And the staff are always very friendly -- greeting you as you come in and again as you leave. We've experimented with most of the menu, and have to recommend the spicy tuna roll and the sunshine roll (topped with paper thin lemon slice). But honestly, we haven't been disappointed in anything."}
{"text":"The food is good however it takes forever for them to get it out to you. Any takeout orders, regardless of how small they are, take over 45 minutes. Also, I saw a small portion of their kitchen and it looked filthy."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night around 7pm and the place was pretty packed. Ordered 4 rolls and it took around 35 minutes to get the first roll. While we were waiting we noticed how almost every table around us had at least one dish delivered that was the wrong thing and had to be sent back. We ended up having an extra roll brought to our table by mistake as well. The food was really good, but the service was bad enough to not make us want to come back. Super slow, all what appeared to be high schoolers with no direction. It appeared that they were incredibly overstaffed as well, but no one seemed to know what tables ordered what and there was really no organization. If you happen to go at a time that isn't busy it might be worth it, but going when there's a crowd is not worth the time."}
{"text":"I've been here once, and I plan on going back. My favorite sushi is plain tuna, and Sushiya had the best I've had in a while. As far as I'm concerned, it was perfect. The other stuff was quite good, also.  The dining room is small and not exactly romantic, but the food and service are great."}
{"text":"Sushiya is always amazing. We keep coming back because the sashimi platters are enormous, for the price and quality, and the Sushi Chefs take pride in the presentation of each dish. The Owners are over-the-top friendly and remember their patrons. I can't say enough about this establishment---we Love Sushiya!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I almost always go here when the craving for sushi and sashimi hits. Yesterday, we brought my parents for dinner. As always, we ordered a sashimi platter which had crab legs and whole shrimp along with the usual fish and garnishes. We also ordered 3 rolls on the happy hour menu. The rolls came out at different times because they come out as they are prepared. Someone had commented on a previous Yelp review that their rolls came out at different times. Of course they do, they can't sit and wait on the counter while the others are being made! Anyway, everything was excellent as usual. We will come back when the craving hits again."}
{"text":"If we could give a 4.5, we would. Great sushi and atmosphere.  When we walked up, we thought it was closed because the windows are so tinted and the lights low. Luckily, they were open and not too busy on a Sunday night at 6:30-ish. It is a pretty small place with 3 1/2 booths, probably 6 tables and then the sushi bar.   We were seated and handed the sushi order form but no other menu. We noticed black books on other tables and grabbed them. It was the full drink and food menu and then a photo album with pictures of the sushi rolls and descriptions of what is inside them. Helpful for sushi novices or for anyone regarding their specials.   We were there during happy hour (daily until 7:30!) and ordered many items on the inexpensive list (Cali roll under $3!). Veggie tempura to start and the sauce was so good. (Our wimpy roll ;-) )Crunch, Cali and AZ rolls were all on the list and were extremely fresh and tasty. The Las Vegas roll has rave reviews on here but was probably the roll we liked least of our bunch. The AZ was unique and crazy good! It tastes like a fried Cali roll with a seafood salad and yummy sauce on top.   We also appreciated that the presumed owner went around checking on tables. I know many complained about the timing of the sushi being too spaced but we actually appreciated it. We had a few minutes after tempura before our two non-fancy rolls arrived and then 10-15 min after, as we were finishing up, they brought our last two. Especially with fried rolls, we liked being able to focus on those while fresh and hot.   The only slight negatives would be not being given menus and we had no set server for our table. There were about three different waitresses checking on our table throughout the meal and they would ask the same questions as the server prior to them. We did get a correct order, refills on our drinks, and our bill in a timely manner. Thus, not unforgivable. :-) Definitely found our new local sushi spot."}
{"text":"The sushi is good, we had the king crab roll and the baked scallop roll. We also tried the king crab soup. It was different but was worth a try. The udon noodles were not anything to brag about. Kabuki is much better.  Service is nothing to write about. 3 different people asking us the same questions. We had to get our own sauce, and they never came and checked on us. In addition, people who came in after us were served before and the party was 3x our size. I will probably look elsewhere for local sushi."}
{"text":"Hard to rate this one.  The atmosphere is great.  Service is great.  Food is fresh and the place is clean.  I've eaten here twice, and each time I got very sick within a few hours.  The first time I thought it was a fluke or something else.  But after the second time, nope it's related to Sushiya.  I'm bummed, but I'll be going to the other places where I don't get sick"}
{"text":"The service is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars. The food is always amazing, however the service is on and off. We always have to get the attention of the waiter for more water or more drinks. They are always happy and friendly just usually understaffed. But a for sure for the sushi!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My boyfriend and I went on a late Sunday night and were the last ones there. We asked if it was okay to sit down at 8:30 (they closed at 9:30) and the staff was very welcoming and nice. We hurriedly placed our order for 3 rolls and some nigiri. The Jalapeno roll was their special that night so we ordered that and it was delicious! All of the sushi we had was really good and fresh. I order Unagi at every sushi restaurant I go to and theirs was by far the best I have ever had. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive and the sushi chef even asked how everything was.   All in all everything was perfect. The sushi was fresh, prices were good and you can't beat that at a locally owned place. Unfortunately, I'm not in Gilbert too often, but when I am, I'll be sure to stop in."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place! The owners treat you like family, rolls always fresh & amazing! And they have ALOT of spicy rolls which I covet! My go to place when I want amazing food & service! And the prices are reasonable! Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The sashimi is the best. I ordered yellowtail sashimi and they delivered belly parts with out even asking. The Giesha is a great roll. I love how they torch it to make it even more tasty. They smoke their own salmon in house and it is absolutely fabulous. Not too much smoke so you can still taste the fish. I will be back. So far the best in the east valley."}
{"text":"Poor service. Untrained staff. I was with a group and was informed by the waitress that it was reverse happy hour. We were shocked when the bill was twice as much, and the manager pretty much told us tough luck...even though it was their mistake. Many better sushi options out there in the valley, will not be taking my money back here."}
{"text":"Love this place! The sushi is always fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of their hours. They close between 2:00-4:30 and we've tried to go there about 10 times now around 3:00, after school and usually happy hour but they are closed, so we go other places. Please open back up by at least 3:00!!"}
{"text":"This little gem has deliciously fresh fish, innovative rolls, and friendly faces. I look forward to sitting at the sushi bar and trying the chef's recommendations, soon."}
{"text":"Have always ordered to go from here. Always busy on weekends, but pretty quick when ordering to go, even when they are busy. Love the baked green mussels. Have not been disappointed with anything we have ordered. Reasonable prices for good food. Not overly fancy, not paying for decor. Good sushi at a fair price."}
{"text":"I wanting to come here so bad and finally did. The place was unique and different looking. They had a great selection of sushi and the sushi was very fresh and the hot sushi was  well cooked. I really enjoyed the premium sushi with the avocado in the middle it was very good. Our waitress was very helpful and introduced us to all the varieties they offered. After our meal we ordered dessert that was excellent it was fried Icecream with a fried bun, whipped cream and strawberry sauce! All the selections they offer you don't know what to choose and the dessert makes it difficult to decide."}
{"text":"I've probably ordered more spicy tuna from Sushiya than any 3 people combined. I'd put them in the top 3 sushi spots in the entire metro. The taste is spot on.   Caveat for anyone using delivery services: They put the fish on top of the roll instead of inside as a way to save time. It's more similar to nigiri than a sushi roll at that point. Honestly, it weirds me out."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been looking for a good sushi restaurant.  Sushiya ratings seemed OK but maybe a problem with service.  We went for lunch and the service was good.  My wife ordered Sashimi with a spicy tuna roll.  I ordered the spicy tuna roll and spicy salmon roll.   The Sashimi came to her as Nigiri, not Sashimi.  She didn't want all that rice.   The spicy tuna and salmon rolls were nothing but a California Roll with some spicy tuna and salmon slapped on the top.  What we both noticed was the rice was not cooked all the way and was chewy.   I doubt we would go back based on the chewy rice alone.  The rolls were nothing special!"}
{"text":"Ordered food for pick up over the phone. Was given a quote to pick up at 6:30 they called me just after 6 telling me my food was ready early... I live 20 minutes away but I scrambled to get my toddler ready and in the car. We head over and as soon as I walk in someone asks me if I have a pick up order, I say yes and we walk over to one of the registers. When I get there I see one of their servers signing something in their guest checks on top of a bunch of To go boxes. They tell me that it's my order and try to check me out. Basically my raw fish sushi has been sitting out for a half an hour, and obviously has turned into a writing desk!! Gross. Now I'm surrounded by 6-7 servers and the owner, waiting for an explanation or solution and they don't even know why that would bother me! They told me they usually put to go orders in the fridge but apparently not mine. While this is happening the owner just walks away. Super unprofessional and unsanitary!!! They Offered to give it to me for free--- ummm no thanks!! Don't go here! There are so many other places that won't leave your orders out for half an hour or let their servers use your to go orders as a writing desk."}
{"text":"This place is great! Our waitress was wonderful. Edamame & Squid Salad was perfect. The Phoenix roll was incredible. Volcano roll.... Not so much. I hated it. It was sooo mushy! It has some kind of spicy mayo in it. It seriously tasted like nothing but mayonnaise. The consistency was just mayo also. I definitely recommend this place, just watch out for the Volcano Roll."}
{"text":"We went here recently & had terrible service. Although we got seated right away, after 20 minutes we had to go grab a waitress to take our drink order. The service in general was not good. However, the food was pretty good. We won't be going back though."}
{"text":"This place is top notch every time we come! Great happy hour (5-7) and a very friendly staff and owner! Definitely will be back! I've eaten here about 10 times and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"As several others noted, the service here was lacking.  A vague \"sit anywhere that's clean\" came from somewhere in the back of the restaurant as we walked in.  The two waitresses managed to create a mild feeling of chaos every time they passes by despite the fact that the place was not that busy.  The green tea was made from instant tea powder, not brewed.  The miso soup was good, but salty.  The salads were fine.  The sushi itself was mediocre.  Most of the menu consisted of cucumber or CA rolls with other fish on top...what a cheap way to save on the amount of fish served.  We ordered a shrimp tempura roll, a specialty eel roll, and a specialty tuna roll.  The shrimp tempura was cooked well, good flavor and crispy.  But the roll itself was poorly made, and each piece managed to fall apart after being dipped in soy sauce.  The specialty eel roll was good, and for $12 it should be.  The specialty tuna roll was definitely lacking...in tuna.  Again, the roll was poorly made and fell apart as I went to pick it up.  That's when I noticed that they had wrapped a thin piece of tuna around a big piece of crab stick.  Definitely not what was described in the menu.  And definitely not worth the price of a specialty roll.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! My husband and I go here almost once a week. I love getting the Phoenix roll or the popcorn shrimp roll. They have good deals during happy hour. They even have a reverse happy hour. If your looking for good food is recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place has great sushi. It's walking distance to my house so we've been there a bunch of times and always have a great experience. It's common for the chef to make you a cool little dessert for free especially if you sit at the bar. The owners are very friendly. I dig the Saki bomber Thursday special but it can be dangerous crossing Gilbert road after a couple of those bad boys."}
{"text":"Great Sushi!   One of my favorite places to eat out!   Fabulous customer service,  they are always friendly."}
{"text":"My son and his family drove in from LA for the holidays and he and my GD wanted some sushi and Japanese food.  The last time they were here in AZ we went to Taiko and they enjoyed that, and wanted to go there again.  But like I said in my last review, Taiko has taken beef off their menu and now have no beef dishes at all.  So I decided to give this place a try again, even after a crappy experience the last time I was here.  We had to wait for a table, but it wasn't long.  So I have no complaint about that.  We ordered a whole assortment of appetizers/entrees/sushi/and misc items.  All of our food came out in a nice steady stream without one thing being overly delayed.  And, the food was all OK, with nothing really being outstanding.  But I have two somewhat negative comments.  The fish used for their sushi is not fresh fish, but flash frozen fish.  I can tell you this for a fact, since I used to be a commercial deepsea fisherman and absolutely know the difference between fresh fish, no-so-fresh fish, and frozen fish.  While the sushi was OK, it would have been a whole lot better if the fish was fresh.  I also ordered the beef teriyaki and it was terrible!  No taste.  Over cooked and hard and dry.  I complained about Taiko having taken beef off their menu, but this beef teriyaki we had last night should have been taken off the menu too.  Frankly, it seemed liked they had an old piece of beef teriyaki on the grill, that had sat there for a while and dried out, but they dumped it on our plate and served it to us.  So I guess the bottom line here is that I was not satisfied and will not be going back here again."}
{"text":"Since I can't give a 3.5, I'll round up. The restaurant was clean, the price was good and the service prompt with follow-ups and drink refills. The sushi was good. Nothing unique or amazing but good. I was a little surprised that the tuna on top of my roll was chopped/minced but the taste was good. Iced tea was big (which I appreciated!) but tasted a little old."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi!  I come here often to eat great sushi, unlike some sushi restaurant feels like you've been ripped off.  Good service and the staff sincerely make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place in Gilbert for the quality and price. We love the Sashimi Combo and AZ Roll!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My boyfriend and I have been going here for years, and the quality has remained on point throughout. Despite having many sushi places near our house, we travel a bit to come here at least once a month.  The service is always very friendly, and the food is fresh! Our favourite rolls aside from the traditional stuff are the albacore roll, geisha, and the Arizona roll - however their fish is perfect on their own and over rice as well."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood sushi bar!    The staff is super-friendly, and the rolls are original and fresh."}
{"text":"Reverse happy hour begins at 7:30 pm Thursday through Saturday. True Japanese Sushi from one of the most philanthropic families in the East Valley.    Try the Arizona Roll and enjoy some of the finest Sushi might around."}
{"text":"So I'm house-sitting in Chandler and running some errands and I read there's a new sushi restaurant opening that's close by.  Being bored and wanting a drink I decide to stop in and check out their menu to see what they have to offer.  Great service and clean restaurant with a nice menu with good prices.  Had a beer and salad ($12 w/tip) and discovered although they opened in the summer and in the east valley that this place is a hidden gem.  The owner is a nice man who is eager to please and his staff is just as well.  They have a great menu and some good signature rolls (check out the Butterfly roll).  If you live nearby and don't want the same old cut of the mill Japanese restaurant, definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Just had four rolls and the Sushi Combo Jr. along with a large Saporo beer and it was teriffic!! and all the waitresses was very attentative and took care of us right away. The sushi was very good and flavorful. definitely worth it and I strongly recommend this place.  I will be coming here more often!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour rolls!   We love this neighborhood sushi bar!  With its beautiful contemporary decor,  tt is by far our favorite place to endulge in sashimi.  My favorite is the Poke Bowl!  It is full of sashimi and seaweed salad.  We've also had the salmon, shrimp, ahi and crab rolls.  Hubby had his $1 beer and $4 Melontini for me!  Little cutie pie didn't care too much for the udon veggies, so we'll stick to salmon roll for him."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Arizona. Seriously... Also a huuuuge selection, with all very fresh foods. Happy hour is super cheap!"}
{"text":"A nice and cozy restaurant that serves tasty sushi. Happy hour offered every day of the week. Pleasant staff although service a bit slow."}
{"text":"Like a predator who watches and circles their prey from a distance, I watched the ebb and flow of cars in the parking lot and chose this night to pounce.  And boy did kitty enjoy.  I was particularly fond of the soft shell crab and the Arizona rolls.  I sit here satisfied and ready to slip into a wasabi induced coma.  Kind of surprising inside - compact but cozy, trendy sushi house decor, very clean.  Give it a whirl - I love that it's in a neighborhood and not a busy shopping center!  I will be going back.  (Oh yeah, appetizer, 3 special rolls, 2 drinks, tax, tip = $35 - didn't see the ticket so I'm not sure if some of that was happy hour specials)"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE EVERY FRIDAY FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS! I order Blue fin tuna & my Trav orders Baked green mussels, Yellow fin Kama & Tuna tataki. ALWAYS AMAZING! Sushi Master Chefs Sung, Jason, Nick, D.J are so talented, the quality is better than anywhere you will go and by far the best prices! The key is to get here before 6pm or after 8pm on Fridays...but it's worth the wait regardless!"}
{"text":"Not overly impressed with the sushi here. It wasn't bad, but it just lacked somewhat in overall taste and freshness.  I did enjoy the happy hour menu and prices. The service was good and we enjoyed the atmosphere. This place is worth the happy hour prices if you're In the area, but there's far better sushi in the valley if not!"}
{"text":"First time here after having driven by a million times! (Doh!) love the portion size, price, and Chef Jason did a great job and is super friendly. Will definitely be back again! Whoop!!!"}
{"text":"Well, based on the reviews, I would have to say that the sushi was disappointing. The flavor and quality of the sushi was decent, but the portions of the fish on the rolls was very skimpy. I have eaten a lot of sushi in my life and this was by far the smallest servings of fish that I have ever seen. Even my out of town guests commented.  The customer service was pretty good, that's about the best I can say, unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is a great little sushi place.  Food is good, the owners and other workers always remember us and greet us by name, and they have great happy hour and reverse happy hour specials.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and bento plates. Sushiya is a family favorite. Awesome and attentive service. Crazy good food. Their Deluxe Surf & Turf roll is seriously the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great sushi!  We come here a couple times per month.  Fast friendly service. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Interesting experience. Food was mediocre at best.  Tempura was doughy and the dipping sauce was bland and flat. Sushi rolls were average. Instead of making 50+ types of average tasting sushi rolls, one wonders why they don't pare the selections down and make them well, instead. Didn't care for the hard rock music blaring away. Will not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I don't exactly have an expert palette when it comes to sushi.  I stick to the basics and seek out cheap happy hours.  Sushiya definitely impressed me, and I think even sushi snobs would agree.  The restaurant setting was clean, but mostly unremarkable.  One chef worked away behind the sushi bar.  We got there for happy hour which was fantastic.  Salmon nigiri was a steal for only $2.50.  The fish cuts were long and thin, and the fish was moist and seemed fresh.  Ditto for the yellowtail nigiri ($4, not on happy hour).  Even the rice had a good flavor/texture.  I really enjoyed the killer roll (eel roll w/ salmon on top), which was good value at $6.50 on happy hour.  There was a thick menu of very unique combination rolls that were artistically prepared.  For instance, the caterpillar roll has carrot eyes and sprout antennae.  Like I said, I usually keep it basic, but I'm looking forward to branching out my sushi experiences at Sushiya.  Full disclosure:  The $1 edamame  was good (I liked the sea salt), but the California roll was only OK.  They have specials which run during football games.  I'll keep that in mind for 2011."}
{"text":"Great prices during happy hour. Spicy tuna roll was average. Sashimi was excellent."}
{"text":"Honestly the rice for the sushi is not that great and the fish on some of the rolls seemed old, this was my second time going there resulting in the same flaws. Good prices, disappointing sushi"}
{"text":"Place is pretty dirty, the maroon wall is in need of badly being painted! The worst part of seeing the red light fixtures over the prep table full of dust!!! Full of dust. Calamari is pretty chewy, good taste, but really chewy. The jalapeno took less really good with the exception of the sweet stuff on top. The spicy shrimp roll is really good. Miso soup tested like dishwater. Ehhh overall not bad but not my first choice."}
{"text":"WTF, my favorite sushi place is in Gilbert?!?!?!    It's true, I saw a coupon so I checked out the reviews and decided to give it a try with a couple of friends.  It was fairly quiet when we got there around 6:30pm on a Saturday but that didn't last long, it was packed just after 7.  We got a large variety of rolls and sushi and we enjoyed it all.  They have the usuals there and a few signature rolls that we really liked.  The fish was fresh tasting and we thought the rolls were nicely sized, well prepared and had a nice presentation.  I can't resist unagi and it was very tasty there.  We all agreed the green mussels are awesome, luv the tangy sauce!  Our last visit included non-sushi eaters and they enjoyed their entrees, it looked like they had plenty of fresh veggies and weren't sauced to death.  We even got them to try a couple of the less scary rolls and a little taste of sushi and other than the scaredy cat look on their faces they said it was pretty good.  I'm not a sushi samurai, I didn't train at the SCI or anything, but its the tastiest of the handful of places I've tried - in the valley.  I don't think they're trying to be another place that rhymes with ma, just a nice local joint with good food & fair prices."}
{"text":"I think this is the freshest, most innovative sushi around.  The chef's are awesome and will give excellent suggestions.  Last time we were there, they let us sample their smoked meats (smoked in house!!!).  Can you imagine???  Smoked Salmon, smoked in house at a sushi restaurant?  It is delicious as was all the other smoked selections they offered us!  Wow.  I HIGHLY recommend Sushiya Sushi even if you are not in the area!"}
{"text":"Quality was pretty good and so were the prices due to the happy hour specials... which are decent but would be better if they expanded it a bit.  It will not replace my regular sushi joints but if I'm in the area and cannot get to my regular places, I will go here."}
{"text":"Chicken Teriyaki for our 4 yr. old.  He loved it.  We had Las Vegas Roll, Rainbow Roll and a Tootsy Roll plus Miso Soup and Edamame.  Salmon Nigiri and Green Tea...Sake Bomber.  Full house, some had to wait in line....get in and get in early.  Great Place.  Great Food.  Great Experience."}
{"text":"Sushiya has a great happy hour, everyday 430-730 and reverse happy hour Thurs, Fri, and Sat 730- close. Sushi is very good and the rolls are always on point. So glad I found this gem around the corner from my house."}
{"text":"Love this place- we've never had a bad experience at Sushiya. All of the food is fresh and delicious. Some people complain about the wait, but that's because this place is busy! I wouldn't want to go to a sushi restaurant that didn't have many customers, just so I could get my food faster. The seafood ambrosia is my new favorite roll: crab and cucumber inside, topped with a mix of fresh tuna, salmon & yellowtail. The best drink on the menu is the Vodka Passion! Yum, but strong! Happy Hour is excellent and is offered every day 4:30-7:30."}
{"text":"Sushi... Tastes...so...good!!! I love the variety they have. Sushi always tastes fresh and flavorful! I love the popcorn lobster roll, I think that's what it's called. They give you a lot and it just tastes so amazing. You can tell they don't give you old fish with your sushi.   One thing I'd have to complain a little about though is their service. Not because they aren't nice, but because they have a problem communicating with each other and mess up orders. I live about 25 mins away and had to run back a second time to pick up almost half my order because it was wrong or they didn't give it to me at all. But! They do fix their mistakes and they give you extra goodies when they mess something up. I like that. It's fair for your inconvenience.   All in all, great restaurant and great food!"}
{"text":"Sushiya has great sushi and definitely some awesome happy hour options. Unfortunately, the hours for happy hour and general hours of the restaurant were never quite convenient for me. They were closed on two or more occasions that I visited. However, on visits that were successful, I always left with a full belly and satisfied my sushi craving."}
{"text":"Horrible service.. servers were taking amongst themselves while we wait for them to notice. Food was not great quality. There had to be just 9 people here tonight on a Thursday at 8pm.   Please pay attention to your customers."}
{"text":"This place gets some stars for being close to home.   However, I'd rather order take out rather than eat in the restaurant. It has no charisma and the waiters are not very well trained.   The sushi rolls and nigiri we ordered were all fresh and well plated, so I would definitely order again."}
{"text":"I'm a sushi nut ! I've had it for lunch and dinner before while living in the NY&NJ area. I don't normally stray from my regular sushi haunts but decided to give this place a try this evening. It is only bout 1/4 mile from my home and I've passed it by probably 100 times.  I got there at 5.40pm and the place was busy. The sushi bar was quick and the wait staff were on their toes as far as service. The portions of fish were incredibly large. I'm not sure I've seen portions and a selection of rolls etc like this before.  Forget the Ra Sushi's and even Kona Grill where service isn't really what it used to be. Go with the Mom&Pop local places.  Very well done!  This coming from a sushi nut and someone who's been in the restaurant business for over 20 years."}
{"text":"I am new to sushi but have to say I LOVE it and Sushiya is one of the BEST places to get good quality and delicious sushi! You won't be disappointed! Excellent value for the price too!"}
{"text":"Eh it was ok. I got grossed out by the sushi chefs not wearing gloves. It could of been the way their hands looked? I dunno! I am not sure if they should be wearing gloves?  I wasn't impressed by the sushi. The ambience was nice though!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour!!  Food is amazing....  The deluxe role is the one with the onion rings"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!  I think this place is best place of the town. I like to eat their sashimi and special rolls and sakebomb!!!! Thanks sushiya!  I love it!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was nearly non existent. Our drinks never got refilled. Worst of all, the sushi chef was preparing food with no gloves!! Yuck!!!!"}
{"text":"Four stars? Really? I'm convinced that the folks in Arizona wouldn't know good sushi if it fell on top of them. This place was okay, very average. Unless you're a local who frequents the place, don't expect the service to be great. (There was a large group at the sushi bar and they new the chef by name.) I didn't feel like my money mattered as much as theirs. Service was a little on the slow side and they weren't particularly friendly. The sushi itself was \"eh.\" Let me just say that there are many more sushi places out there that blow this place out of the water. It's good if you're just looking to satisfy your sushi fix, but if you want REALLY delicious sushi, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great sushi place! The staff is very friendly. Sushi is very fresh and cut very clean. Rolls are fantastic as well. The spicy tuna and Arizona roll are the best. The happy hour prices are very nice as well. Give this place a shot. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight.....awesome happy hour prices and friendly service. Sushi was also very good!! Coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had since living in Phoenix for past 12 years . Would definitely make he trip again from ahwatukee . Great prices too."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the state of Arizona (and I have ate a lot of sushi).  Amazing happy hour 7 days a week, my kids love their sushi almost as much as my husband and I.  We eat here for birthdays, anniversaries and instead of pizza night.  The owners re very friendly and I love all the servers constantly helping us.  Drinks are always full and I love the secluded location.  Craving it o bad after I am writing this review that I think we are going for dinner.  Arizona rolls and White Mountain (life changing)"}
{"text":"Tried this place the other night.  Ordered 4 different rolls, two of which we liked, two we didn't.  They brought our rolls out one by one which was cool but seemed to take forever to get the last one.  I might try this place again for happy hour specials because they have some pretty good deals."}
{"text":"Great sushi and excellent service (especially if the owner is in the house). We've tried others but always end up back at Sushiya."}
{"text":"The sushi was okay, prices were a bit high for the lack of taste. Took an hour to get 4 items to go. Probably won't be back for a while"}
{"text":"We are in from Chicago, and I am Japanese. The sushi was not very good. The rice was not  cooked correctly nor IMHO were the ingredients prepared correctly. The staff was friendly and efficient. It seemed like the food was prepared for the tastes of non-Japanese clientele."}
{"text":"We went there for the first time last night and it was great!! It is very casual. We have never found a sushi place in Gilbert that we have liked and this was great!!  We ordered several different types of rolls and were pleased with each of them! We ordered two specialty rolls that were outstanding. The Crazy Shrimp Roll and Arizona Roll left us wanting more!   The service was also great! We are now going to be regulars there are reccomend it to others!"}
{"text":"You can find us here every Friday night for the best and most reasonably priced Sushi in Gilbert! John the owner is so friendly and the Sushi Chef's, Jason & John make the most beautiful dinners for us and the quality is excellent. We LOVE this place for Sushi and highly recommend Sushiya!"}
{"text":"The sushi was alright. Nothing mindblowing, and nothing stood out. The flavors didn't jump at all."}
{"text":"Close to my house, fresh tasting rolls/sushi, chill atmosphere and cheap saki bombers on Thursdays! I love this place!   Also, they have pictures of most everything on the menu which is REALLY helpful when choosing from their selection!"}
{"text":"Great flavor, decent price but what keeps me coming back is the real wasabi, I can't find it anywhere but here and it is so damn yummy.  The service here is also great."}
{"text":"Date Night with my sweetheart took me through the doors of Sushiya Sushi. We were greated by smiles as we made our way over to  the sushi bar. The atmosphere was welcoming, cozy and friendly. We had menus and our drink order without a wait. After we placed our order my sweetheart and I had a bit of conversation, and in a short time, our first plate of sushi arrived. Our sushi chef did an amazing job in the timing of our orders. The chef was friendly and gave us some freshly made wasabi that was incredible! The sushi was fresh and so delicious. The staff was friendly,  and inviting. This was an early Saturday dinner, as we were leaving, the restaurant was full and everyone looked happy. This restaurant is a gem, it reminds me of one of those special places that you return to often because the food and staff are great, and it feels like a great neighborhood spot you can't help but love"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Fresh fish and Nick can make some killer rolls. Best place we've found since moving to the area from the Bay Area."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. Nice ambiance and a great happy hour. The kids menu was nice and the honey chicken was a huge portion and delicious. (I almost don't want to divulge this secret but... next time you want honey chicken from Pei Wei, just come here and get the $4.99 kids meal.)  We liked everything we got; Arizona roll, Crazy shrimp roll, Jalapeno roll, and crunch roll. My favorite was Arizona roll. The wife enjoyed the sea weed salad as well.  Everything was very tasty and fresh! I'm usually not a huge sushi person but this place may have changed me and I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Being from CA, I can find great sushi just about anywhere, whether it's traditional or AYCE.  Was vising friends in E. Arizona and wanted to get some sushi on our way back to LA.  Having to go through Phoenix, we Yelp-ed for Sushi and found this joint.  I'm normally hesitant to try anything related to sushi or seafood in Az (it's landlocked), but because of the high reviews, decided to check it out.  Definitely worth the gamble.  Fish was amazingly fresh and the portions were larger than most anything you'd find in CA.  Their rendition of spicy rolls were interesting (spicy meat on top of the laid out rolls) and were delish.  The udon was interesting (no broth) but well prepared.  They have a lot to choose from, so the combo plates help make things easier and are well priced.  I definitely recommend this place, and even tell my friends who plan to visit Az about this place."}
{"text":"Hands down best Sushi I have ever had. The owner is nice and always remembers your name. The service could get a little better, I have had a wait a few minutes before getting a glass of water or something, but I still go to this place atleast once every two weeks. For a while I was going twice a week.   Crazy shrimp roll is really good!"}
{"text":"Tasty and fresh sushi right on the Chandler-Gilbert border.   The rolls I suggest that are bomb.com include:  Las Vegas Roll: Cream cheese, eel, avocado, crab and shrimp... Deep fried. Need I say more? A few dunks of soy sauce and this baby is delish.  Dragon Roll: Crab, cucumber, eel, and avocado. Just the right amount of freshness.  You also can't go wrong with the ASU roll, Crazy Shrimp roll, or the Ladybug. The sashimi I've had here has been great, too.   Don't forget to pull up their e-coupon on your smartphone! $3 off your order of $20 or more, or $7 off an order of $45 or more. :)"}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi in the valley by far. Awesome family run business. Staff is really friendly. They have a tremendous selection and very unique rolls. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Gilbert, AZ and it has been difficult finding good sushi. I've been to Sushiya Sushi several times now and the experience has been great every time. The fish is fresh and the portions are good. Sit at the bar and if you're lucky you will have Nicholas be your sushi chef. Nicholas enjoys his job and if you tell him of something you had elsewhere he will do his best to duplicate it.  Try the Phoenix Roll : Spicy Salmon, Cream Cheese, Avocado, crab, Masago, Deep fried, it's delicious! $8.50 Another good one is Geisha Roll : Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Tuna, Crab Mix Inside. Tuna, Salmon, Yellow tail, White Fish on Top. Spicy Wasabi Mayo Sauce, and Sliced Onion on Top. Torched. $12.00 You can't go wrong with anything you order.   They offer cooked food, kids menu, beer, wine and sake. The prices are fair and the staff & owners are friendly. A good dining experience. They are open on Sundays which in California you could never find a sushi restaurant open on Sundays."}
{"text":"13 people descended on this place to celebrate a birthday and they rose to the challenge.  Everyone ordered differently of course and the food and beverages were delivered promptly.  While they accommodated us beautifully I would call ahead next time to give them a heads up about the group size.  Every bit was eaten except for 4 stray pieces of sushi.  Thanks to the owner and staff of Susiyas for a great job!"}
{"text":"Went here with some guys from work.  Very good food, great atmosphere.  We sat at the bar and got to watch our food being made.  Will definitely go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Just moved from North Phoenix and was looking for a new sushi place especially one with good lunch specials and happy hour. Sushiya is close to where we moved - thought I'd give them a try since they had decent recent reviews  I order one of their lunch specials - 7 pieces of sushi plus spicy tuna roll ($12.50) -the Spicy Tuna roll was different then anywhere I've had - the tuna was actually on top of a cucumber roll (but it tasted good) -7 pieces of sushi included: tuna, yellowtail, shrimp, crab, eel, salmon and 1  other...decent as well  Overall my experience was good and I'd recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"The service was amazing! Super fast and very friendly - and it was a busy night. They must have heard the complaints and definitely fixed it. We got 5 different rolls and they were all delicious. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Happy Hour ROCKS at this place!!! the staff is awesome, and the sushi is delish!!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh! This place is our new \"place\". We get the smoked salmon when we visit. The fish is always very fresh, the presentation is beautiful and the people there are so friendly and make sure that your visit is a nice experience. The wait staff is very friendly and always eager to help. If you start to frequent this place, they will know you after the third visit. The owner is very nice and makes sure to be present around the restaurant in case you need anything additional. This time when we went in, we also ordered the honey chicken...highly recommended, very good! This place is usually pretty busy on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, so we usually go on a Sunday or if we need our sushi fix, we go to their happy hour. They have amazing Japanese beer and different wines to choose from as well as sake. YUM! I would encourage you to try this establishment at least three times to write a review...maybe on a busy happy hour night and then on a Sunday and maybe for lunch. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Literally just left this place. Needless to say it was a major disappointment. The reviews were fairly good so we decided to try it out. The food came out piece by piece. Overall the food was okay, but the service was terrible. There were 6 people in our group so we ordered a lot both from the happy hour and regular menu. They did not check on us once after our food came. Not once. It's is Monday afternoon with only about 5 tables full and they couldn't manage to check on us once. Same drink from beginning to end.   Good luck with this place. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I like this place... Good sushi for a good price and if you sign up you get great coupons!"}
{"text":"I'm trying out as many sushi place while I'm in Arizona. Sushiya would be my second spot I've try after RA sushi. I think the price is great not very expensive. Fish are cut a bit thick. Sashimi are usually cut 1/4 in thickness. The platting isn't eye catching just simple. (see pictures I uploaded) I wouldn't say ill never come back, but its not my top choice."}
{"text":"Wow. We try to have sushi once a month and we just found our new spot! 8pm on Friday night and they have a reverse happy hour so we dove in with a Tootsy, Shrimp Tempura, gyoza, a couple of sake bombers, all on special, plus a Las Vegas and Phoenix rolls. Quadruple Wow. Everything was fast, fresh, and delicious. Plus, they do take out, I guess it may be once a week from now on."}
{"text":"Might be my fav sushi place here so far. I've been on the search for a solid sushi place and the review lead us here.   I got the popcorn shrimp and hubby got the California. The popcorn shrimp was yummy!!! And just enough to satisfy.   First impression : can't wait to try more.   Price 4/5 average but great for happy hour  Food 5/5 good  Overall 4/5 I'll be able to see if it dwarves five stars after a few more visits"}
{"text":"My go to sushi restaurant when it comes to service and food quality.  I only go there during happy hour but that is just because of the deals.  Also, back to back happy hour 4-7 then again from 7-10.  Both with different specials.  Small Asahi, salmon kama, and the salmon nigiri (sake) is my default.  The ASU roll, Arizona roll, SoftShell crab roll....I can go on and on.  Kids love the Jacky and Las Vegas rolls.  Mouth watering all ready.  Let's do this!!!"}
{"text":"I can't find another sushi restaurant that's as fresh and yummy as this one. Not only do they have a picture book of each sushi roll they offer (which usually is rare for sushi restaurants) they have the best tasting sushi in Arizona. Calm environment with friendly staff. Favorite place that I recommend to any sushi lover!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place because of the stellar reviews. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The service was great, however, the food left much to be desired. We ordered the Las Vegas roll, a Philly roll, and a dinner combo with a Crunch roll and teriyaki chicken. Everything was so bland, and so disappointing. The food all lacked flavor, and depth. I'm not really even sure how it was possible for everything to be so blah. I'd love to give them another shot though, because the service was so awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm picky about sushi and I love this place.  We have been here several times.  It's worth the drive out from Tempe.  Better than most sushi places about accommodating gluten-free diners.  I seem to recall that sometimes they have gluten-free soy on hand and other times they don't...so you'll still want to bring your own, just in case.  Best to avoid during peak dining hours as the dining room gets very loud and crowded."}
{"text":"This is a review for a year ago. Horrible experience and needed to make sure I change my review. Watered down soy sauce? Enough said.   This little Japanese restaurant has only one bad thing...and that is their slow service (hence, minus 1 star). Other than that, the food is delish and the price isn't too bad either. PS. They always have coupons available online so that's really nice! ;)"}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a Tuesday night. We got seated right away and the service was fine. The problem was the sushi itself--it really tasted off to us. It was room temperature, and made us wonder how fresh it was (or wasn't). One of the rolls tasted so bad I nearly gagged. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Good sushi place tucked back into the Fry's shopping Center. Prices were good from four dollars to nine for what we ordered. Sushi tasted good and fresh A couple of unique rolls. The miso soup was OK a little bland.Service was wonderful staff was warm and polite. Checked on us frequently."}
{"text":"For a Friday night, wasn't a crazy long wait, maybe 20-25 minutes. We sat at the sushi bar to get seated faster. The guys behind the bar made me laugh but you could tell they were crazy busy. We got our app out fast and then all of our rolls to follow. Everything was tasty and fresh. If we lived closer we would come here more, but if we are in the area again plan to stop by for sure!"}
{"text":"Shame on you Sushiya. You lose a star for false advertising.   I met a friend here for lunch on a Monday. The restaurant sign says it's open seven days a week, but it was closed."}
{"text":"Tried this place last week, because of the Yelp reviews and I have to say, SO GLAD WE DID! This place is different than other sushi places, as in they have a very large amount of different and unique rolls. There are so many to chose from I cant wait to go back and try new ones. I honestly think you wont be disappointed in coming here. The place is a bit small, like most sushi places, great friendly staff, nice atmosphere. If you are looking for traditional rolls, sashimi, soups, they do have them, but I suggest you step out of your box and order their popcorn shrimp roll!  Sushiya, thanks for the delicious food, we will see you soon!"}
{"text":"Another awesome dining experience here. Jason the Sushi Chef is great. We recommend the Korean style Ramen soup if you like seafood and jalape√±os"}
{"text":"I'm almost afraid to write a review for Sushiya Sushi because it may become too popular. My wife and I recently hosted an event at our home and after some research we thought to have in catered by Sushiya. They performed exceptionally well. We selected off their catering menu (which is the same as their table menu) and the food was just as you would receive at the restaurant.  They personally delivered the food and made the event very high touch. The restaurant is owned by a married couple so there is NO chain restaurant feel. They can get busy at times but its worth the wait. Plus they have one of the best Happy Hours I've seen, including a reverse Happy Hour. They have both sushi bar and tables to choose from. Sushi is fresh and creative. They also have other cooked Japanese staples.  They value of their product is also very good. So with that I give a strong positive recommendation for Sushiya Sushi. Only request I have is please don't go on the days I plan to visit!"}
{"text":"First off, I have NEVER written a bad review, I am very laid back when it comes to customer service because I have been a server for 3 years.   I am a regular here but after my last trip , I will not be back- or atleast not on a MONDAY night because the server told us that's the only night she works there.  I understand it is a small - extremely UNDERSTAFFED restaurant but our last order was forgotten TWICE and our server did not acknowledge us at all and acted like every customer in the restaurant was a complete burden. She did not smile one time. Being a server myself, I can not imagine acting that way towards a customer! - Like everyone has said - the service is HORRIFIC, would be a great place if they hired some people who were fit to serve a table with a even remotely decent attitude.  Its sad that  they aren't able to get a decent staff and I am sure they have lost a TON of business because of it.  Positives:  very clean establishment, great sushi, AWESOME prices and the owners are friendly and nice people.   Advice for the owners- PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE ATTITUDE OF YOUR STAFF, its make a HUGE difference."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here since they opened.  Great sushi at great prices. The staff are very friendly. Highly recommend even if dislike sushi but love sake. Christal"}
{"text":"Great sushi. Service needs a little work. Overall an enjoyable experience and good value. Tried this place because of the Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed!  Upon arrival the hostess server greeted us quickly and seated us. Oddly enough, with the number of people who helped us it was hard to tell who was our dedicated server. The drink refills came quickly enough, however small details were neglected (had to ask for wasabi, extra napkins weren't brought). The server wasn't particularly personable by it's okay, the sushi more than made up for it!   We had the Calamari, Tootsy Roll, Arizona Roll, Popcorn Shrimp Roll, and Jalape√±o Roll. The rolls were fantastic but the Calamari left something to be desired. Stick to the sushi and you'll love this place!"}
{"text":"Great little hole-in-the-wall sushi joint. Place was packed on a Friday night...always a good sign.   I loved the menu. It had full color pictures and descriptions of each sushi roll. Very helpful.   Ordered about 5 rolls, but the Arizona Roll (california roll deep fried with spicy crab and tuna on top) was my favorite. Salmon Lover (salmon and avocado) was also very good. We got the mushroom balls as an appetizer and they were delicious. Basically a fried mushroom with some spicy sauce on top, what could possibly be better?   Rolls took an unusually long time to come out. Maybe because they were busy? Other than that, everything was great!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to report, I'm dropping 2 stars off of this restaurants review. I wanted to only drop 1 off, but my wife insisted I drop 2. And here's why:  This place has always had decent sushi. Like many places it can be hit or miss, and here they're mostly hits, so I'm not writing to complain about that. The quality of sushi is about the same as it's always been, and that is to say hard to beat for the happy hour price, and prepared consistently. Except for one thing, the portions seem to have shrunk as of about 1 month ago. It used to be that you couldn't fit a single slice of an arizona roll in your mouth in one bite, but now they seem to be making the base slice as large as a typical crunch roll and subsequently there's less topping as well. It tastes the same, but it's not the same value/slice seeing as how the price is the same.   The size of sushi changing doesn't bother me that much to be honest, I get it, it's a business and cutting down on costs is important, whatever, that's fine. Our real problem has become the service. On our latest trip there we took two friends with us. We showed up at 7:15 and ordered our food. It took a while to arrive, but not unreasonably long considering the amount of food we ordered, and drink service was decent for about the first 45 minutes. After we were done eating however, we didn't see a waiter for probably 20 minutes at all. At this point all of the plates were clean and we were wanting our check so we could book it home. There was a problem though, there literally wasn't a single employee out on the floor, we couldn't have waved one down if we wanted to. Once they finally made their appearance we managed to wave them down and get our check. Here's the part that annoyed us the most: We were gladly given the check, and we immediately put our credit cards in the checks and put the checks at the end of the table. From that point, it was easily another 25 minutes before they actually ran the tickets and brought back the receipts. During this time not a single dish was cleared from our table, it was a mess. All in all, by the time we got out of there it had been and hour and a half. And the restaurant wasn't even busy. Maybe 15 people total.   I've been eating here probably once every week or two for the last 2 years and the service has never really been stellar. Sometimes the service was quick, and the waitresses were attentive, however, more often than not, that isn't the case. It's very inconsistent.  Like another reviewer said, they keep changing staff, and after a brief discussion with one of the waitresses, my wife and I learned why. During one of our visits my wife sat down and mentioned to the waitress \"I'm glad you're here because that other gave us slow service last time and we didn't tip her well.\" The waitress replied with \"Oh, well she gave you slow service because we don't get to keep tips so she probably just doesn't care.\" We asked her who gets to keep the tips and she said \"the lady in the yellow shirt\", who I can only guess is the owners wife. Yeah, you heard that right, they pay their wait staff around minimum wage and all the tips go to, you guessed it, the pockets of the owners. Normally, I wouldn't have a problem with this if you are paying your wait staff a decent enough wage to give a crap about their job, but apparently that's not the case here. It's clear to me now that the reason the wait staff don't care about the service is because they have no incentive too.   I'm assuming this is what's going through the mind of the wait staff \"You need a refill and it's been ten minutes since you went dry? Your plates are piling up and starting to glaze over after you've been done eating for half an hour and we haven't cleared them yet? You ask for your check and I don't pick it up for another 20 minutes to ring it through? I don't care, I don't get tips anyway so don't leave one\"  It's my understanding that in the japenese culture wait staff are not tipped, and are not expected to be tipped. Which is fine, when, you're, in, japan. But the culture here is such that if the wait staff aren't getting their tips, it will show in the service they provide, and it's my humble suggestion that this restaraunt figures out a way to make it worth your wait staffs while to actually try harder. If the wait staff are incentivized properly and actually have a stake in customers returning to eat there again, the business will profit from it. If the wait staff stays like they currently are, customers will continue to be driven away and business will be lost. I hate saying it, but my two friends that I came with said \"Kyle, I don't know why you took us here, but we're not coming here again\", which makes me very sad. I live close, so I will still return, but two potential customers were last that night, just think about how many more you'll keep losing if things don't change?"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Read the reviews and decided to check this place out. The menu was intense. Lots of great rolls to choose from. We didn't venture far from our usual favorites but guarantee the next time we return we will try all different rolls. The Volcano, Yellowtail Sashimi, and Soft Shell Crab were worthy of the 5 stars. Let's see we had about 3 rolls each and sake and the bill was under $50. Had we brought the coupon we printed out and of course left on our kitchen table, we could have saved $7. By the end of the night our belly's were full and our wallets didn't have to take a beating. Overall it was a great night."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restraunt I've been to.  Jason and Nick are the sushi chefs and they are incredible. Not your average sushi chefs. These guys take sushi to a whole new level. All of the rolls are great and sashimi is super fresh! Cute lil restraunt I .will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and even more mediocre service. I went here with a friend last night and I was extremely disappointed to say the least. The service, first and foremost, was extremely lackluster. We may have been seated quickly but our waitress and \"service\" was almost non-existent. We never got refills for our drinks, food took forever to come out, and our waitress never checked on our table after our original order was taken. I was really underwhelmed by the gyoza and I felt like the noodles I had were somewhat slimy and somewhat overcooked. My friend's roll orders looked to be far better than mine, but I'm also not a sushi person. I'm sorely disappointed by the fact that our waitress could check on every table but ours it seemed and that I had to flag down two other waitresses to get the check and send my very dry chicken order back. The first waitress I politely asked if she could get our waitress for us. She never did. The second waitress I just politely asked to get the check, send back the dry chicken, and get to go boxes. I've ordered to go here before and I thought they were slow just getting a to go order out. Now I realize they're just slow in general. I think this will be my first and last physical outing at Sushiya."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a co worker. We were promptly greeted and sat at the bar. We choose the two rolls for 9.00 lunch special. Sushi was out fast and tasted good. Great deal for lunch prices. Atmosphere was fine except sound seems to carry and there was table with squealing toddlers that was annoying."}
{"text":"We go to Sushiya atleast 2 to 3 times a month....    we love the selection of rolls wenhav3 to chose from and the price is very reasonable....."}
{"text":"Checked out this place for dinner last night with my daughters and their friends after reading great reviews on yelp. I called ahead and the wait time was 20-25 mins and asked to be put on waiting list for 5 people and we would be there in 10 minutes. They said they would call out my name once a table is open. Came there and waited out side in their waiting area since their waiting area inside had only 2 seats and was already occupied. After waiting 40+ minutes and seeing people leave and people that arrived after us being seated, I came in to ask when our table would be ready. They apologized and got a table ready for us within 5 minutes. Since we waited so long I already checked out their menu and started putting in orders. Our order came out fast, and mostly everything was good. We were thrown off by their calamari since it was the size of onion rings and not the little ones we're used to getting. Other then that and the waiting confusion it was great. Prices were decent for all their menu items."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE AND MEDIOCRE FOOD. We waited 10 minutes at our table before the server even took our order. Then, we waited an additional 45 minutes for our food, at which point we had to ask 3 times on the status of our order. The server had clearly forgotten to put in the other half of our order, but refused to admit to it. Instead of listening to us when we told her to just cancel our order, they proceeded to put the food on our table and charge us! We could not get out of that place faster ...  Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"The good: Good food!  The bad: Waiter handled the drinking cups by the top edge where guests put their mouths to drink.     Found a hair on one of the dining plates.   Tops of the drinking glasses were super rough because they were used to gather ice from the ice bucket.   Waiter didn't know what was in a lot of the dishes.   Waitress wasn't sure what she brought when she served the food.   Would I go again? No."}
{"text":"Regrettably, we got some really old fish for lunch last week. Left most of it on the plates. We were regulars until this unfortunate event. Time to find another sushi place!"}
{"text":"So this spot was really hard for me to find idk why haha, when I got in I didn't really have any expectations, the place is small and cute, the waitress was very nice, I ordered the sushi rolls with my friends which all were in very reasonable prices despite the time of the day it wasn't happy hour or anything, and when I started eating I was very impressed with the sushi! It was so good! I defiantly recommend this spot if you want to try super good sushi that isn't so expensive. Seriously wow!"}
{"text":"When we arrived on a Sunday evening, an older man \"greeted\" us at the door.  I say \"greeted\" because I don't even think he made eye contact with us - instead he just grunted and said \"two?\" Then he dropped two menus off at the sushi bar and walked away... okaaaaayyyyy.....  Luckily, the young waitresses who helped us were very pleasant and generally attentive. The guys at the sushi bar weren't very friendly, but I assume they were focused on sushi rolling!   Average sushi - nothing spectacular, but good enough that I might return every once in a while.  We tried three different rolls, but to be honest, they all started tasting the same!  The jalapeno roll was our favorite, the ASU roll was okay but a little heavy on the crab.  Since Happy hour is EVERY DAY!! (woo) we started with the veggie tempura.  For the price, you get a rather large portion, but it was very very bland.  I don't think the tempura batter had any salt."}
{"text":"So far the food is good. As far as Jafar behind the counter I was apprehensive at first. It turns out he really knows what he is doing, from marinating flavors and using an ice smoker for smoked lobster and crab. I want to come back and try that and give a different review. Which means the makeral was decent, the octopus and roe were hefty portions and the not chewy. They also have the elusive asahi black. Best beer to have with sushi.  My complaints are the edamame. If you like it melted then try it. However I like mine very raw or aldente. It was terrible although the taste of the garlic was still great.   Lastly the bathroom was dusty. Dust that fake plant."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for sushi. Nice little place and mostly packed every time we visit. Very fresh sashimi. The sashimi salad is flavorful and tasty."}
{"text":"Got the spicy salmon roll and the 2-pc squid roll. Amazing flavor and healthy! Full after just this. Chef was really nice and actually conversational. The butane torch burning of the top of the squid roll was pretty legit too. Quiet atmosphere; went during lunch hour."}
{"text":"This place always has coupons for lunch, 15% off dinner, and great deals in your local coupon booklet so make sure to grab one before you go. In case you forget, don't sweat it. They have this great special for $20 where you can choose 3 rolls and it comes with edamame and miso soup. I am not sure how they can deliver taste and freshness with their low prices, but somehow they get it done. Everything tastes very fresh. They get pretty busy so make sure that you are patient. Their service is great though and I always leave happily full."}
{"text":"We just tried Sushiya for the first time, to say we are impressed is an understatement. We LOVE it. Very fresh, tasty rolls, fast, friendly service. This is officially our favorite sushi place. We plan to be 'regulars'."}
{"text":"We have been to Sushiya a couple of times and have left happy each time.  My wife an I enjoy the good sleaction of rolls and our kids are always treated well by the staff.  The unique kids desserts they come up with have them asking to go back often.  The happy hour prices are great with pretty good options for rolls.  The only negative and or request I have is that Sushiya really needs to incorporate a water filter as the water they serve is absolutly undrinkable..."}
{"text":"Good sushi and good happy hour selection. My wife really enjoyed the red bean ice cream.  A ton of spicy selections, too. The beef sushi was smoky and so tender it was almost buttery.  The lobster and crab was pretty good too. Service was hit and miss; very attentive at times, but noticeable absences.  Really wanted to give them 5 stars, but didn't quite make it tonight."}
{"text":"They changed the wait staff. From the little blonde white girls to little Asian girls that are MUCH WORSE.   By far the worst service at any Restaurant you will find in Gilbert. Especially if you go at anytime where more than 4 tables are taken up.  No more special desserts, no more hellos from the owner, no more great sushi, they apparently lost their good Sushi Chef and the two guys working back there now are just too inconsistent. Sometimes you will get a decent roll but this last time, the Sushi was just falling apart all over the place.  Fried Vegas rolls, COLD. miso Soup flavorless, Bathroom and Hallways Disgusting.  BAD BAD BAD.   After coming here for 2yrs and probably 12x, we are done."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars on the quality of the sushi,  I came here for lunch when on business and saw all the good ratings here so decided to give it a try.  First off is don't come on Monday for lunch they are closed.  Second, be prepared to wait a bit for your order and items to come.  I'm ok with that to a point  because I think they really spend the time to prepare everything so it comes out nice.  But the woman working there seems not  to know many answers to the questions I had. She really could not answer which fish are in which selection.  She kept leaving and coming back to give me answers but between that and handling all the other tables it got to be a long wait to get everything.  So on to my sushi order. When I first got my order I was a little surprised of the selection I got, it was mostly different types of tuna.  I had red tuna, white tuna, albacore (a tuna), yellowtail, spicy tuna rolls, and 1 salmon sushi and a california fake crab like sushi, and a shrimp sushi (Ebi).  All the fish tasted really good though, the white tuna melted in my mouth. The spicy tuna is made a little different than at most places.  They chop it in pieces and and kind of float it over rice rolls. Very good but would have liked a little more spice. The sushi chef was very nice but seemed a little serious at the same time.  He would keep asking if everything was ok, and I just kept saying everything was fine as I tried to sneak in a picture of my dish. I don't know why but somehow It felt like I was committing an illegal act..  Anyway, 5 stars for the great food and 4 stars for the the little things that I think that could improve."}
{"text":"Our fav sushi bar!  Awesome rolls. Great prices for the quality and the service is PHENOMINAL!  We'd eat here everday if we could!"}
{"text":"Thanks for all the previous reviews! Just ate here for Happy Hour and the food was great! All the rolls were delicious! Especially the Arizona Roll! Fast friendly service! I recommend this to anyone wanting great sushi at affordable prices!  Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I wish were able to rate places on service separately. The sushi is great but service was just horrible tonight and no excuse for it. I would understand if they were busy and running around like crazy people but it was pretty dead tonight. Two young teens were trying to be our servers. I didn't see the woman I usually see, whom I assume is the owner?  The girls never verified our order and never once checked on us. My friends order wasn't correct and they were surprised when she said she wanted what she originally ordered. She didn't touch the food she didn't order. Then we never got refills. I only got a refill when the girl brought us our check. It literally took them an hour to finally come and take our cards. Again. Not busy at all. Anytime I would see one of the girls walking towards us, we would try to get their attention. Instead they would look to the ground and go to another table. I was very disappointed. I've been here often and even on busy weekends and never ever had this bad of an experience. It sucks because the sushi is delicious and prices are fair. But the service is most definitely slacking."}
{"text":"This place sucks now. I think they are under new management, because the sushi just isn't the same. My friend got really bad food poisoning here too."}
{"text":"Close to Chandler-Gilbert Community College. Nice atmosphere. Good sushi.  I like their smoked salmon nigiri, and my fiance said their squid is very good.  Service can be a little off sometimes.  On two different occasions, the waitress brought me someone else's food.  Weird."}
{"text":"Quintessential AZ sushi... Not very fresh or particularly flavorful, but will do if not feeling picky... Happy hour prices are good"}
{"text":"Went here last night with family and the food was great!  rolls were very good, we had the Arizona, dragon, soft shell crab, and cal roll with baked scallops.  All were very good, and you cant beat the prices here.  My wife had the yaki udon noodle dinner, that was ok.  Thats the only reason why we gave 4 stars.  But hey, this is a sushi bar.  Will def. be back and soon!"}
{"text":"This food was fantastic, service very timely and friendly, seating comfortable not on top of one another. The sushi is fresh and portions generous. We will be frequenting this place."}
{"text":"The BF and I went to a movie last night down at the Hollywood theatres and figured we'd get there a couple hours early and walk around..... wrong. There's not much around there. So we started driving south and stopped in the parking lot of Sushiya to figure out what to do. Well, we hadn't eaten yet, but only wanted something really light and decided to give Sushiya a try. I'm glad we did! The place was really busy, especially for 9 o clock at night. We ended up eating at the sushi bar, which was cool because we got to watch all the sushi be made. We just ordered a house salad, the inari and cucumber rolls. The salad was nothing special, just the typical salad. The real special thing was the inari.... it was the best I have ever tasted! They make what our Sushi chef called 'special rice' which has green onion and ginger in it. It made it have this perfect sweet and savory taste. I would come back just for that. The service was good and the sushi chef was friendly. Overall, it was a nice place..... I would go back just for the inari.... yum."}
{"text":"Walked in...walked out...  We walked in and the hostess was talking to her friend. He mumbled something to us..not sure if it meant i'll be there..or take a seat...either way...after her friend left, she looked at us from across the room and she yelled across the room \"I said any seat\" with some nasty manor isms.    We just left...  They lost our business, i'm sure their sushi is awesome, but I enjoy a good experience as well.  Overall: If you like being treated like scum, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I love this place! Such a great find with a fantastic variety of high quality sushi. Family owned and wonderful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Can't count how many times I've been there over the years - Always enjoyed going with my family. *Kid friendly - there will be kids. *Best prices in town, really!  *D√©cor: Average, nothing fancy. *Good quality sushi. *Can be crowded at the dinner hour, go early and there is no wait. *I  generally order only sushi -  since the tempura tasted like it was microwaved frozen food (have ordered only twice) I just stay with the sushi. *The seaweed salad is one of my favorites. *Incredible happy hour deals on sake, beer, etc.                           One of the best kept secrets in Gilbert!!!"}
{"text":"Tried four different rolls, all four were good and fairly cheap.   The arizona roll is by far my favorite, the phoenix roll was my least favorite.   Its a small place, they try to move you through the place as fast as possible, but then they bring out one roll at a time every 5-10 min. I would rather have all four rolls brought to me at the same time. Ill make that clear next time.   I recommend this place if you want good/cheap sushi."}
{"text":"Don't let the look of this small hole in the wall sushi place scare you away! This place is amazing. Not only does everything always taste ridiculously fresh but the are so many options to choose from. They are always adding new specialty rolls onto their menus so if you are an adventurous eater there is always something new to try. The place is very small and can get pretty busy on a night but during lunch it is a small quiet space to come grab a quick bite. I have been here multiple times and always try something new and am never disappointed. The wait staff are always friendly and knowledgeable about the items on the menus as well. This is one of my favorite sushi places."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, each time really enjoyed the food. The sushi always was very flavorful and fresh. The only thing that I felt needed work was the service. The wait staff is friendly, but there has been more than one occasion where it too took an incredibly long time for our sushi to come. Its frustrating when customers come in 15 minutes after you and they get their food first (I was at a table of 4 and they had 4)."}
{"text":"A few friends of ours kept mentioning this place so we decided to check it out one day. We walked in and there were 2 women standing by a computer in the back, we stood awkwardly just inside for a bit before deciding to walk back there and ask to be seated. The decor is a bit tacky for my taste and the place is pretty small.   I have to say that their specials are awesome. The 3 rolls for $20 is a steal! However, it only comes with 1 miso, which would have been nice to know when we ordered it. We weren't impressed with their miso. We ordered a Las Vegas roll, 2 Rainbow rolls, salmon and yellowtail sashimi. The rainbow roll was good, the Vegas roll had shrimp in it, which is really odd. My husband's allergic to shellfish so we're usually pretty good about subbing in different things. Thankfully I tried the Vegas Roll first. It wasn't something I'd order again. The salmon sashimi was decent, their rice was a bit overcooked and had too much vinegar in it. The yellowtail was exceptional, some of the best we've had actually.   All in all we'd come here again during happy hour, but I wouldn't pay full price for anything but the yellowtail."}
{"text":"The code blue roll and spicy salmon are my favorites. Can't beat the happy hour! This is one of our all time favorite sushi places to go."}
{"text":"This our go to place near home. We're here every other Friday or so. To start, they have a late happy hour. 7:30. That alone is a perfect reason to go. Especially after work on a Friday. The service. If you go when I do, Friday at 6:30, there may be a wait to be seated but they keep it moving and communicate well. The sushi bar sometimes gets backed up but, again, the servers communicate well and check on you often. I say \"servers\" because they do this odd thing where they share tables. It confused me at first, but I got used to it and now I even like it. It's super easy to get someone's attention. The owner/manager walks around and asks you how everything is and is super friendly.  The food is pretty good.  The fish is fresh and well cut. The kitchen items are really nice. The salmon belly sushi is awesome (I normally do not like salmon) and a steal at 4 bucks. The salmon skin roll is also really well done, and under 4 on happy hour. The bluefin is a fair price but pure loin meat with no fat. If you like red meat tuna it's certainly worth 6. The grilled tilapia belly is a hit with my daughter and wife, but not me. Just personal taste. If you like the eel, this appetizer would be squarely in your wheelhouse. The value can't be beat. Happy hour is basically all the way through dinner (and reverse happy hour starts right after) the prices are actually lower than most sushi bars. My bill here is normally less than most sit-down chain restaurants.  Even though I'm positive on most aspects, Sushiya somehow has that magic quality of being greater than the sum of its parts. My whole family loves going here and will be regulars forever. It's a real gem."}
{"text":"I love sushi, when I read the reviews about this place most of them were accuret. We had gotten poor service and took them forever to get our rolls of sushi out. I do recommend getting the tiger eye roll everything else I ordered was just okay."}
{"text":"I used to go there once a week for lunch then now only once in a while. I tried their rolls and they are good, just a bit thin for my taste so now I just get a couple of hand rolls which are a better value for me ($3.50) and a California roll ($2.50) to make sure I won't be starved in the next hour or so.  The place is small but the owner is always nice. The staff can be hit or miss, sometimes slow sometimes ok. They have coupons online that you can get but cannot use them for Happy Hour.  Prices are pretty fair for what you get however you might have better options in the neighborhood.  All in all, I don't mind to stop by once in a while and get a sushi fix."}
