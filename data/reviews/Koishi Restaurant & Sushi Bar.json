{"text":"LOVE this place! The ingredients are always fresh and  all dishes have great balance in flavor. Sashimi salad is delicious and fried calamari app is airy and crispy. All of the sushi rolls I've had are yet to disappoint.  Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times after finding the place through a friend's recommendation. 
Food has been consistently good, not great. Service a little slow when busy."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Great sushi, friendly service. Definitely making this a regular sushi spot."}
{"text":"Seriously, the BEST sushi my husband, son and I have ever had.  We are from Atlanta and have a lot of great sushi there as well, but this outranked everything.  I do think that if you have someone who is not a fan of sushi or has never tried it, you need to bring them here and they'll instantly be converted!  We had the cherry blossom, pink floyd and firecracker rolls.  Could not even beging to tell you our favorite because they were all outstanding!  I also had the wonton soup and house special friend rice...both were full of flavor.  So many times I've had wonton soup that has basically been brown water/broth with a dumpling thrown in.  The wonton I had last nigh at Koishi was rich with flavor....excellent!  Highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it, I really did.  Reasonably priced sushi, convenient location, menu with all the flavors of the rainbow (roll)?  I didn't even mind the former Pizza Hut layout.  What I DID mind was the 50 minute wait for a to-go order to be completed; when I called to place the order, I was told it would take 25 minutes.  We probably showed up after 30, and then proceeded to sit on a bench for another 20 minutes until the order was complete.  By the time we got our three (yes, only three) rolls home, the spider roll was cold and mushy.  The other two were fine (spicy salmon and rainbow), but after the long wait I think I was maybe just glad to be eating anything.  Provided you don't mind waiting for them to catch, debone and descale, and then finally make your dinner, Koishi is a decent option... but there's many other choices around town."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch many times as they have great lunch deals! Can't recall the exact details but I think I got 2 regular rolls, salad, miso soup and egg roll for $9.99. There's always 20% off check total coupons in local clipper magazine. The sushi here is decent but you can't beat all that food for just $9.99! You definitely don't go hungry and I usually can't finish all the food."}
{"text":"Plenty of parking. Hostess on cell phone most of the time. Water, attentive. Not the fanciest of decors but authentic sushi and Asian cuisine. Can't beat price point."}
{"text":"Eat sushi a lot but this was first time at Koishi. wasted a lot of money..... worst sushi ever... over cooked, and the seaweed was so chewy and old that I almost choked on it. 
Dont go near the seafood hot & sour soup....one sip and I gagged. Disgusting. Like dishwater.
Very disappointing so unable to recommend and will not order from there again."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!!! The place to go for sushi.   Waiter is attentive, but  door staff is less that attentive and usually distracted, but after seating, VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE."}
{"text":"Affordable and tasty sushI! The ambience isn't great and still looks like a Pizza Hut, but who cares because the food is delicious and cheap. My friend and I went there twice within a two week period and the waitress remembered how my friend likes her sushi (with avocado on the outside), which I found quite impressive. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend a few times and was pleasantly surprised.  The ambiance was really nice.  Service was friendly and quick.  The food was really nice.  Haven't been in a while, but this definitely needs to change sometime soon."}
{"text":"We decided to order out and wanted to try a new place. This was a good choice! We had sushi and a few Chinese dinners. Everything was cooked just right and had really good taste. The rolls I thought were a little small but really good. The food was delivered fast and hot! I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a good meal!"}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant often. After we relocated from Hong Kong, we missed the Japanese food a lot. We found this restaurant generally meets our expectation and the price is reasonable. We usually had good experience here except tonight we brought our neighbors over. Food was good but service was awful. We didn't finish our food yet, the waiter had already put the check on the table. We told him that we had coupon but he didn't accept it for split bills, even I pointed out the coupon was indicated per group or table. We were very disappointed by the service."}
{"text":"This place is great! Quick service, friendly waiters, great fresh sushi with decent portion size and really affordable. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"The freshest sushi in Charlotte! I have been to Cowfish all the way to Sushi 101 and this place has such great flavors."}
{"text":"My third or fourth visit here (I keep coming back!). This place is top notch for sushi, sashimi and nagiri. Wait staff is very friendly and attentive. For those that don't enjoy sushi, they have a wide variety of stir fry and other dinners. If you haven't been there yet give them a try. Yeah, you'll be going back too :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome! Have never had anything that I didn't like!!! A hidden local gem! Service is always great and the food quick and served hot. All foods taste super fresh. Visit it at least twice monthly! Yum"}
{"text":"I enjoyed Koishi.  I actually worked across the street for quite some time before I tried it out this year. Yes, it is an old Pizza Hut, but the ambiance is nicely low-key Asian.  I was with a group and I found the sushi was good and the price point excellent,  My group enjoyed their selections.

Not the biggest sushi rolls, but tasty and the service was friendly as well as timely. I would definitely return for future visits."}
{"text":"Sushi is average at best. The building is dumpy, the manager is rude. Walked in to pick up dinner tonight, nobody in the restaurant. The hostess was kind, but that is about as positive as I can be on this place."}
{"text":"Great service, fresh and amazing food all for a great price.  What a gem"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fairly close to my home. So, we have frequented the place for its convenience. Last Sunday was our last visit to this place! Went for my son's birthday and ordered our usual array of his favorite sushi. Then we sat for 50 minutes watching table after table of later arrivals get their orders of sushi. I stood to inquire and nothing had been started on our order. No reason and no courtesy. Despicable and apathetic people. Never again! Would urge you to avoid it at all cost!"}
{"text":"My family and friends love going to Koishi.  I didn't like Sushi until a co-worker took me there.  Had the Pink Floyd and Cherry Blossom and am now hooked!  Can't decide which is better so we always get both.  

There are other restaurants that make.thd cherry blossom and their version of the pink floyd, but it is not anywhere near as good as Koshi.  Presentation is better also."}
{"text":"At two stars I am obviously not a fan of Koisha, and I feel that is being generous. I ordered takeout thru Grubhub last night for 1 each of Spicy tuna hand roll, Spicy yellowtail hand roll, and a Firecracker maki roll. What I received were 2 unspicy tuna hand rolls and a dull. muddled tasting  and chewy Firecracker roll. The nori on the hand rolls was tough as saran wrap. The pickled ginger, gari, is restaurant made from regular ginger and is also tough and extra vinegar-ed. At least they don't use green horse radish for wasabi. I think the restaurant is on a slow descent to closing and cutting corners, although from the first review here quality issues reappear. Apparently Grubhub is aware of slow service because ordering takeout at 6:30pm orders are predicted to arrive in the 8:20 to 8:45 window. So when mine arrived after an hour and half, that was a little early. What I should've done is hop in the car, drive to Carolina Place mall area and stopped in at Mr Tokyo for outstanding, buttery fresh seafoods in my sushi. It's that much better with the plus of being all you can eat for less than my total at Koisha. That's the future for me."}
{"text":"Been eating here since they opened the doors, they have always had great food. I've argued with folks saying its some of the best sushi in town. I had horrible service today and turns out the manager was my server. I said something as I left about my experience, she became argumentative and rude"}
{"text":"Great quality sushi and noodle dishes, I also like the fact that you can give them your phone number for a togo order and repeat the last order that you've placed with them. That to me is quite a time saver when a restaurant has multiple take out orders, I have dined in here as well but prefer to just order take out since the service inside can be slow and unattentive."}
{"text":"I came here once last year for bad sushi. After being convinced to give it another try, I returned for even worse sushi.

Their best rolls were exceptionally mediocre. I was unable to finish the sashimi, which tasted old, dry, and of poor quality. I think this place has higher ratings for their Chinese food, because their sushi is straight terrible."}
{"text":"By no means is this place bad. The restaurant was clean. I did not check the bathroom though. I've had the sushi there on a slow night and it was good. It was prepared correctly and the fish didn't have a smell of( I have been sitting for a week). I have tried regular menu item like the lo main and the fried rice , with the same result, really good. Simple easy menu. 
                                     The service is a little bit slow, but I think sometimes they might be understaffed. The only problem that really gets me is $8 for a large hot sake!!! ???
You have got to be kidding me!!
                                      All in all this is a good restaurant and I will continue to go there."}
{"text":"This was my first visit -- sampled 1 sushi roll and 2 Chinese entrees. The Kung Pao was very bland.  The sushi was good, so next time I'll just explore their sushi. Service was slow despite few patrons, so I can't suggest it for a group or at lunchtime."}
{"text":"My favorite entree is the orange chicken. But everything I have had here is delicious. It's right down the road from my place so it's a regular takeout place I stop by. And they are always very friendly there."}
{"text":"Probably of my top 3 suahi places PERIOD. I love it because they know you well for all of us regulars, great local neighborhood place. Authentic sushi is served here with a lot of great selecrtions from the chef."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's a hidden jewel. Food is fresh and delish. Great for sit down or take out.."}
{"text":"I've given a fair shake to Koishi and been three times just in case I had a bad experience. I had heard that they had authentic sushi and so when the Adventurous Palates group decided to go there, I was in. We got a very wide variety of rolls, soup, apps and entrees. Some of it was good, most of it was OK.  I went back another two times with my husband and I wasn't blown away by the quality of the fish any of the times i went and found it very very average. 

The service was not too bad with the big group but when it was two of us it was slower, oddly. And unfortunately it feels like you're in a renovated Pizza Hut. 

Bottom line: The service, food and environment all left a bit to be desired. Will you hate your experience there? No. Will you love it? No. For me, not worth the drive unfortunately."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place isn't packed all the time; it's SO good. The sushi and Asian dishes are equally YUM and all at great prices. Definitely recommend.

Someone else said it, too, don't let the throwback Pizza Hut exterior dissuade you; the food is delicious. NOMs!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. If you want hibachi, prepare for more of just fried rice. Very small but good atmosphere. Speedy service and reasonably priced. UNFORTUNATELY they don't have shrimp/white sauce which to me is essential for fried rice and shrimp haha. But for sushi, I will definitely be returning. 

PS they do take out, which I'll also be doing."}
{"text":"Best Sushi Restaurant in Charlotte. Hands down.  ....    

This place is fire ...

Elite food...


Fish is always fresh

There is no better place for sushi in Charlotte.... this might be one of the better places in the entirety of the US"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I order off of Eat24. I just had some bland rolls as I haven't been feeling well but they were pretty good. It was exactly what I needed. Delivered quicker then the estimated delivery time. Not too shabby at all."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the years. Sushi is always fresh and delicious, service is great. Pricing is good although I never see any advertised specials or discounts. Wait is not bad as long as you beat the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"The food was good but service was sub par. The sushi had great flavor and was fresh no fishy smell. I have heard good things about their food and I wasn't disappointed with that. Our waiter just wasn't the friendliest person. I'm not sure if he was new, if it was a language barrier, if he is always like that or just an off day. It seemed annoyed that we were there.   There are a lot of restaurants in Charlotte to chose from and the lack of quality service make me have second thoughts of coming here again."}
{"text":"The service is consistently good, with attentive staff taking orders, bringing out warm dishes, and refilling drinks attentively. The fried rice is the best we've found in Charlotte, though we are still looking for local equivalents to Phoenix (Greensboro) or Qin's (Houston)!"}
{"text":"I totally agree w/Nicole about finding a good balance for affordable but not cheap sushi!! I have eaten here several times and have always been pleased with the quality of the food which happens to also be at a really good price.  I typically prefer Nigiri or Sashimi  over rolls - but their signature roll is really delish!

I like the sushi combo lunch selections - it's nice to be able to start with the salad ( they have a pretty good peanut dressing) and then to enjoy  a selection of sushi."}
{"text":"Love Koishi! Perfect neighborhood sushi joint with INCREDIBLE service, which you don't get much in Charlotte. The waitress was super nice and welcoming and went above and beyond on offering opinions and getting the sushi to how we wanted."}
{"text":"Sushi is always a tough one for me in Charlotte - I have found places I like but none that I love...and Koi to me is just ok.

Koi is in the neighborhood so I do frequent the place with the neighbors - the food is tasty nothing great but nothing bad, however it seems like the sushi takes forever to be made. I haven't once been there where the entire parties food has come out at the same time.

I also think the sushi pieces are very small compared to some other places I've been to in town.

On a postive note the staff is friendly they do take-out and have an extensive menu for sushi and chinese food."}
{"text":"One of the best Asian food I ever had.. Great food and great service.. If you like Asian food then its highly recommend to visit this place.. Prices are decent for two people it costed 45 but that including sushi as side dish"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here often as it is less than 5 minutes from our home.  Everything is delicious but I especially love the Mango Shrimp. The prices are excellent and the service is usually good."}
{"text":"Not great, but fairly good. Certainly worth the money. I had some different basic nigiri (tuna, yellowtail, salmon) a few rolls and a few hand rolls. Pieces are correctly sized (most sushi is made too big) and 2 to an order. Fish was lovely and fresh. Rice was good. Price is appropriate. Nothing nearby like it, so I'll go again - it was worth it.

If you seek ambiance go elsewhere - place is ugly as a bowery bar.  I don't seek ambiance, so the Pizza Hut origins don't bother me.  

Somehow I think they could be better - given the paucity of good sushi in Charlotte, I hope they do."}
{"text":"Another great reminder that you cannot judge a book by its cover. From the outside, Koishi is easy to discount due to it's Pizza Hut frame and dull colored exterior. However, once you get inside it's lovely! They must have decorated since some of the last reviews because it is well decorated in a modern theme. 

After being intrigued by it's $8.95 sushi lunch special, I had to check it out for myself. I have to agree, it's good and affordable! Hubs ordered the Veggie Feast and it was a nice-sized portion of a flavorful dish. When you are ready to leave, they give you Andes mints! Oh, they think of everything to make a good impression!

The service was very attentive. When they weren't serving, they were cleaning off tables or sweeping the floors. Big plus in my book!

I'm pleasantly surprised and happy to have found a new sushi and Asian cuisine stop! I will return!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved here from LA and were a bit skeptical at first but we ended up very satisfied. We sat up at the bar and were able to watch the sushi magic in action. The food was spectacular and the service was quick and attentive which is something I greatly appreciate being a former server. We had the orange chicken and the Philadelphia roll. All very good."}
{"text":"Love their sushi! Cherry Blossom, Grasshopper, ACAC, Spicy Tuna are just a few of my favorites! The place is usually busy when we go with a minimal wait. You are also able to order take out which saves the wait!"}
{"text":"Koishi is located in an old Pizza Hut, but they have done a great job with making the best of the space. Being open until 10-11pm every night is also an added bonus for the neighborhood. I highly recommend the Ichiban Roll (tempura shrimp, eel, avocado, unagi sauce) - it's a great spin on the Caterpillar Roll, but the added texture & flavor of the tempura shrimp make even the most novice sushi people happy. The Hot Lover Roll is also a personal favorite (scallop, masago, tobiko, sriracha, and spicy mayo sauce), though I am a scallop sushi aficionado, so am fairly biased. I tend to stick to sushi when I order from Koishi, so am not sure how their Chinese/Pan-Asian dishes are."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I'm a sushi snob from New York and this place is great. Get the Cherry Blossom roll and the Pink Floyd. Everything was fresh and delicious!! Thanks Pete for introducing us to Koishi!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this since it has decent enough reviews. DID NOT LIKE. Very bland sushi and missing waiter! Not sure what waiter everyone else had, but the waiter I got was beyond serious and practically scared my mom. 
When we first arrived there was no one there. The place was nicely decorated on the inside though. We waited and were about to leave when he finally came out and sat us at a table. His attitude just seemed like he didn't even want us there. After he took our order, he literally only came back once to check on us. Then disappeared to the back and we had to wait forever for him to come out so I could get the check. (I could have just walked out without paying! Though not my style I'm not that mean) when he finally came out and I ordered the check, he went back there again... By then my mom was kinda upset so we just walked to the register, I guess he forgot I had just asked for the check??? 
The food... Maybe I'm spoiled or just used to better tasting sushi if I'm paying more then $10. Whatever. I ordered the cherry blossom roll, my mom got rainbow roll. I've had rainbow roll before at various places and is usually tasty, but this was just plain and the fish tasted old. My cherry blossom roll, although very pretty and nice to look at was equally as bland as the rainbow. Forgive me if I like to taste the shrimp or tuna that I'm eating. I would give this place 1 star, but we also ordered shrimp fried rice which was by far the best thing we ate there. Thank you shrimp fried rice! For that I give it 2 stars. Will I be returning to give it another shot? Nope! Not even worth it. 
Did I mention that it was my mom's birthday?! Thank you koishi for ruining it. I should have just driven the extra miles in traffic and taken her to sushiya or oneu."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here on a whim one day and came back the very next day! The sushi was very fresh. If you're looking for good sushi place that's not overpriced, give it a try."}
{"text":"3 times with mediocre results - 4th time really bad!  The sushi here is pretty expensive for what you get but this place is close to where we live and my family loves sushi so we wanted to give the place more than a fair shot in the hopes that it would improve.  It didn't - the last time we went we found a piece of metal on one of the rolls.  It was curly and a few mm in length.  We brought it to the attention of our waiter and he didn't say a word.  He simply picked it up and took it to the kitchen to apparently discuss it with the manager or the cook.  A bit later when he brought the check he said that the manager thought it came from the Brillo pad that they use on the cookware.  That was it. No apology, no offer to take that item of the bill, no visit from the manager, nothing.  Perhaps I look like I need to increase my iron intake but it won't be from Koishi.  There are far better sushi restaurants a little farther out."}
{"text":"Cherry blossom, pink Floyd roll, volcano salad. Best kept secret. You don't go for the ambiance or service, but the sushi is great and easy to get in and out."}
{"text":"Yummy sushi and crab rangoon!! The service is good and the food comes out fast. I recommend bringing a sweater though because it can be chilly."}
{"text":"The mister and I came here for some celebratory dinner. I relied on Yelp for a some good sushi and Koishi came up.

Place -  You have to be careful when trying to find the entrance to the restaurant.  I knew the vicinity of the place, but almost missed the entrance when I finally saw the sign to the restaurant.

Food - I was somewhat overwhelmed with the choices of sushi, appetizers, entrees, and etc.. But with a little help from the waitress, I started with the volcano salad - crab, masago, cucumber, medium spicy.. OH MY GOODNESS, was deeelicious.  I am craving it now, while I am typing this. Then I ordered the traditional shrimp tempura roll, which was not bad, and my husband loved the cherry blossom roll (since we were told i was the most popular one).  

Service - We had a kind waitress who was attentive and took care of us.  So I cannot complain. 

Price - It was manageable.  As any sushi place, they will be a bit pricey, but we chose this place because it was not as pricey as other sushi restaurants.  

Koishi! My husband and I will be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through Postmates. I ordered the General Tso lunch combination and it was very tasty and the portion size was perfect!!"}
{"text":"There is a $9.99 sushi lunch special. Comes with your choice: soup or salad (clearly, I said yes to the delightful ginger saucey salad), egg roll, AND choice of 2 maki rolls. Unreal. 
Fast and friendly service- was in and out in about 30 mins. Highly recommend! 
Hard to get to with the construction in the area, but the U-turns are worth it. I promise!"}
{"text":"Came in here late on a Friday night and got the firecracker and cherry blossom rolls with a Sapporro. Pretty good quality and great service from the staff. Very comfortable environment inside as well."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious sushi-- Super Crunch and Super Boost-- spring rolls and miso soup! Compliments on the miso soup for having sea weed and tofu unlike most restaurants. Perfect for sushi lovers on a budget."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here and was not all that impressed, but food was just fine.  

We got sesame chicken and a couple of sushi rolls.  Both the chicken and sushi rolls were fine, but quite overpriced for the quality, so I do not plan to return. 

The woman at the entry stand was quite unfriendly to top it off."}
{"text":"This place has two things going for it.  One, it is the closest place to our house and two, they serve sushi, my wife's favorite food.  The quality of the fish and originality of the sushi rolls are somewhat lacking.  Most every roll on the menu is deep fried or  includes a fried portion of fish within the roll.  I know this is a popular preparation right now but it is not really what I would call sushi.  So the creativity is not there but this is still an average sushi place that you can frequent on occasion.  Their is usually a Groupon or coupon out there somewhere so make sure you get one of those, do your best not to pay full price here.  One our most recent trip we got the grasshopper roll, the cherry blossom and some orange chicken Chinese food dish.  The Chinese food was surprisingly good, crispy, flavorful and well cooked.  The sushi is what it is, average.  People think average is bad, it is not, it is middle of the road.  This place is middle of the road."}
{"text":"Wow!  You would never know by the look of this place that this Sushi is so great.  I'm glad I came here to try the sushi.   If you are in the area this is the best sushi around."}
{"text":"YUUM

Ordered delivery last night through EAT24 and was not sure what to expect. I'm pretty picky about sushi and know good from bad. The rolls we got were EXCELLENT. 

I'm not sure about any of their entrees or service but our order came in time and tasted amazing.

We will definitely be back for more sushi."}
{"text":"Good place for take out.  Food sometimes great and sometimes good.  Dining in has not been a good experience due to service, but the staff are nice.  Highly recommend their noodles:)"}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh, service was solid and the price was right. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner at Koishi last night night and it was great. We both had sushi so I cannot comment on how the cooked dishes are but the sushi was excellent. The portion sizes were about average for a sushi restaurant and the prices were pretty good for the quality. The atmosphere is not the greatest but not all that bad either. The good food for a fair price more than made up for a less than stellar atmosphere. If you are near Cotswold this place is definitely worth a try.

Quick tip: Try the Cherry Blossom Roll."}
{"text":"This is the hidden gem of Cotswold/Myers Park area!  I live in a neighborhood where the Cotswold shopping village is my closet shopping area.  This place looks super cool inside - very well decorated with a modern feel.  I've only eaten at the restaurant (not takeout) - but this place is buzzing every night of the week with takeout orders! I think this place shines in the sushi category - all the rolls I have ordered were delicious.  My absolute favorite is the Cherry Blossom.  I know a few other places that have this roll - but it's my favorite and a must order.  My husband prefers the entrees (noodle dishes) and likes those as well.  The prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Bit disappointed. The sushi was bland. I ordered the nagiri ( tuna / salmon / yellowfish), none of them seemed fresh or tasted anything like they are supposed to.
The decor was nice and the servers were kind and helpful with recommendations but the food was disappointing.
They also have chinese/asian menu options. Had the Singaporean noodles. Again, bland & no heat. Very much lacking in flavor.
This place is so close to my place, i wish it turned out better. Will give it another try and will update the review then."}
{"text":"If you want the best sushi in Charlotte, then you have to come to Koishi.  I have been coming here for years, after taking a chance on a Sushi place that is a converted old Pizza hut.  

I have tried so many rolls on the menu that I can't give a review of just one.    They are all so good.  I will say this is the place you take someone to convert them to loving sushi if they don't already.  The rolls are not cheap, but they are not over priced as well.  You definitely get what you pay for.  I will pinpoint my favorite roll as the Grasshopper roll.  

The entrees are good as well.  I would rank them up there with any other higher end\"ish\" Chinese cuisines (i.e. P.F Changs).

The dining room is not the largest and the ambiance sometimes is lacking.
The service is definitely not going above and beyond, but at the end of the day, the food comes out in a decent amount of time and the water glass gets refilled.
For me, its all about the rolls and that's why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Okay, so the outside makes you wonder if the place is even open (old Pizza Hut building that could use a fresh paint job).  But the inside is really cool.  The walls are so neatly lit and there's a cute small bar.  We tried it for the first time two weeks ago and we will return.  Good selection of sushi, some unique options I've not seen before.  Really nice presentation, the hostess was so kind and welcoming and our waiter was great!"}
{"text":"This is the closest sushi spot to our house and they offer a good, affordable selection of specialty rolls, nigiri, sashimi, etc. There's also almost always a 20% or BOGO coupon floating around somewhere. 

We usually do take out and enjoy it! The few times I've eaten in the restaurant, service has been a little inattentive and slow. 

My favorites include the chef's choice sashimi, cherry blossom roll and grasshopper roll. I'd suggest staying away from their Chinese section of the menu. It's all pretty blah and flavorless. I mean, who goes to a sushi restaurant for Chinese food anyhow?!"}
{"text":"Best little sushi secret in Charlotte.  Hidden away in an old Pizza Hut building they have some of the best quality sushi selections around.  I only live 5-7 minutes from Koishi but can honestly say it is as good as some of the top Sushi restaurants in LA, NY, and Chicago.  I had the spicy Salmon roll and some tuna nigiri and the quality of fish is consistently good.  Moderately priced and the service is always good. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why, but all of a sudden I am OBSESSED with sushi. I can't lie and say it's real sushi though....at least not the raw stuff! But I am more than willing to try any other kind. So needless to say, I was definitely impressed with Koishi. 

We just recently moved right around the corner and am so happy that we found a close by Chinese/sushi spot to fill those cravings. The menu is HUGE! And everything looks delicious, it literally took my boyfriend and I about 25 minutes to figure out what we wanted. But so worth the contemplating :) 

We got the steamed dumplings as an app, delish. I got the house goner salad, which was amazing and a really big portion which I was really happy with because I always find myself wishing it was bigger at other restaurants. For our entrees, we got the shrimp noodles, ACAC roll, and the shrimp roll. Omg where to begin! All of it was sooooo good. The noodles were perfectly seasoned and had the right amount of soy sauce where it wasn't overpowering at all. The rolls were big and delicious! I added cream cheese to the ACAC (vegetarian) which was awesome. And I mean you can never go wrong with a tempura shrimp roll! Everything tasted super fresh and they were great portion sizes. 

The interior was really nice. Very modern, quaint and comfy. The staff was really nice and really knew their stuff about the menu, we had a ton of questions. The menu is very affordable and has a wide variety of things for everybody's pallet. Cannot wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"Being the only sushi bar in Cotswald, I stepped into the gutted out former pizza hut building.    Apparently, no amount of interior re-decorated could take away the spirit of Pizza Hut.    I felt like I was in a pizza hut that could have been located in downtown Beijing.

I had read that Koi was owned by a family known for their restaurants, especially in the Charlotte area.   I ordered a Gen. Tsao chicken and it was utterly bland.   Prices for the Chinese dishes range from 8-13 bucks.

I decided to try what makes this particular restaurant unique in Cotswald and that is Sushi.   The Maki was good, with decently sized shrimp, but rather bland.  

I am still unsure as to how to really rate this place.   It was good but felt tentative.  Definately ok if you don't feel like going far and you live in the Cotswald area - but there are better places if you don't mind driving just a few miles."}
{"text":"I'm ao happy we found this place.  We ordered the just pete (smoked salmon and cream cheese) sushi roll, and the crab ragoon, we usually add fried rice, the one with the pineapple, sooo good! But the rolls are just amazing good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving sushi and wanted to try someplace new. The reviews were good and it's near where we live so we gave it a shot.

It's nice inside. The outside was a bit deceiving, but the interior is simple, but there's a nice vibe in there. 

The menu was cool. I'm a fan of a lot of choices and it had many. 

Volcano salad was epic! Could have ordered two. So delicious.definitely recommend it.

Shared a shrimp tempura roll and their signature cherry blossom roll. Both were delicious. Check out the pics.

Service and Price were good. I would recommend and look forward to our next visit where I can try more from their menu!"}
{"text":"Don't let the Pizza Hut exterior fool you; this is a decent place to grab a quick, fresh and cheap sushi combo lunch. 

Have been a few times with friends and mostly order the Sushi A combo for $8.95, which gets you two maki rolls (generally go with the California and Spicy Tuna), a ginger salad, and an egg roll. The ginger dressing here is quite good, but be sure to ask for it on the side unless you want your lettuce literally drowning in ginger goodness. The veggie egg roll isn't too greasy and the sushi is average but fresh. All this for $8.95 makes it a great lunch deal if you're in the Cotswold area. 

A must have if you aren't ordering off of the combo menu is the Cherry Blossom roll. It's the best roll I've had at Koishi and comes out looking like a flower, which gives it a little extra something, in my humble opinion. 

Service is a bit on the slow side but generally friendly. And there is plenty of parking on the side and behind the building. Only gripe is that it's tough to get in/leave with the barrier in center of Sharon Amity and the no U-turn signs, but no worries; it's worth the bit of extra maneuvering."}
{"text":"Went for the cherry blossom and it did not disappoint. Other than that there wasn't much variety to choose from on the sushi rolls. Ended up with two very similar. I think there was only one server when we went Sunday for lunch but he was not very welcoming at all and acted like we were idiots for ordering the sushi special that they had not erased from the board from Valentine's Day 4 days before. Everything tasted good and was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Though I'm not an expert in sushi - or much of anything else, really  - I can say that I dig the sushi vibe put off by Koishi, from the nice job in the renovated Pizza Hut to the friendly service.

Is it the best there is? Perhaps not. But it's definitely worth a stop if you're in the area. I cannot count how many times I have driven by this place, trying to figure out if it's a shop for Koi or if it's worth stopping in to see if they sell something else.

Once I figured out they were a restaurant, I had to decide if they were worth trying, being in an old building and all. But you know, if they don't spend the money on the building, there is a chance that they might have done so on the menu, and whatever the case, it's working.

Like Hibachi Grill on Independence (not the buffet, the other one) and Krazy Fish in PM, the renovated Pizza Hut scene is smoking!"}
{"text":"I ordered Togo  my first time and I tested and dumped it in the trash! I ordered the same thing I always get from Chinese restaurant but this was made with zero effort. Chicken was not cooked sauce was watered down (looked much like a soup the what I ordered). I was one of the last customer so they might have just put something together to get me out  but no thank you. I will. Or be visiting you ever again!"}
{"text":"Good food! Need to hire more servers. One server during lunchtime on Saturday? He even argue about a mistake on ticket that I've pointed out, not willing to reason. He even avoids the table for a little while. But with my patience and I won. Still will return, of course. Just THAT waiter - he's stoic in face and a bit rude. No hint of friendliness,  yet he done his \"work\", serving everyone on time."}
{"text":"The search for good, affordable sushi is always a challenge for me. You don't want to pay too much, but you also don't want to pay too little - as that's a little frightening when you're thinking about super cheap raw fish entering your stomach. So, imagine my delight when Cotswold centered Koishi offers a sweet lunch special for $8.95.

A few girlfriends and I dropped by this affordable sushi heaven for a quick weekday lunch. Inside (and outside), Koishi isn't much to look at - it's in an old Pizza Hut. No joke. Don't expect to be dancing in any strobe lights or bumping to the hot beats in this joint. But, it's clean and the employees are friendly enough to make you feel welcome. 

For lunch I chose \"Sushi A\", which, for $8.95 is a pretty sweet deal. This special includes two maki rolls (you choose from a list of ten or so), soup or salad and an egg roll. For my maki, I went with the spicy yellowtail roll and the California roll. The rolls weren't anything spectacular, but they were fresh and cheap. Perfect for lunch in my opinion!

As for my other \"Sushi A\" components, the salad was fresh and had a great ginger dressing. And last but not least, their eggroll wasn't too greasy and didn't burn off my fingers when I picked it up. That's a good eggroll in my book. 

So, is Koishi the best sushi in Charlotte? Nah. But this place offers a convenient, cheap and fresh lunch that will satisfy many."}
{"text":"Prefer it for lunch when i'm not in a big hurry. Consistent quality for a decent price. $10 sushi lunch is nice. Tea is always fresh too. Not always so everywhere!"}
{"text":"This would be a one star review were it not for our attentive server. In a word the food was absolutely terrible. The salmon sushi smelled awful, the firecracker shrimp or whatever it was called was cooked in friggin ketchup and the chicken dishes we had were cooked in watery, flavorless goop. We just arrived in Charlotte and tried this restaurant based on the reviews on Yelp. It is unimaginable to me that this place is capable of four stars. I can't remember having a meal so badly prepared that it actually angered me! Shrimp cooked in ketchup. Really? It has been a week since I have had the displeasure and I am still angry.  Terrible dining experience! Avoid."}
{"text":"Have never eaten in but get take-out almost every week. Food is prepared fresh when you order it. Fast and convenient. Food is great. You can watch it being made if you get there fast enough. Always seems to be people eating in when I go to pick up my order. Definitely recommend for sushi take-out!"}
{"text":"House fried rice is great! Perfect for when you are dressed for the drive thru but just not in the mood for fast food."}
{"text":"Decent place.  Came here with a friend to grab lunch and catch up.  It's a bit aways from Uptown, but I hadn't see her in awhile.

The place was fairly empty around 12:30, which was nice.  I ordered the Sushi B lunch special that is a roll and 4 nigiri - I tried a bit of everything.  Nothing really special stuck out from the lunch menu, other than the appetizer salad is pretty big.  You get a solid amount of fish on the lunch specials, but it's nothing that blows your mind.

Service was good.  The dude was nice and not overbearing - he let us talk and eat freely without much interruptions.  He was attentive as well - good job, tall dude with glasses.

Ambiance was questionable at lunch.  It's not wholly the restaurant's problem but for the first part of lunch, there was a little baby that would just scream randomly - that got annoying pretty quick.  Luckily, they left.  I wonder how this place does at night - it looks like it could be pretty cool.  

Plenty of parking.

{"text":"Not a fan of Koishi sushi. I knew immediately when I saw the platter and the first thing that caught my eye was the grey spotted avocado that this was not going to turn out well.  When the avocado is grey with dark spots it makes me wonder two things. One, why would anyone serve a bad avocado not to mention wrap a roll in it for all to see. Second it makes me wonder if anything else there is fresh.      
Along with the sushi I had the seafood bird nest something that was 50% Surumi (fake stringy crab sticks). Not appealing at all.  And the scallop Pad Thai. One scallop sliced, no way there was two. 
I'm surprised at the 4 and 5 star reviews. There has to be much better sushi in Charlotte than this."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the exceptional service, atmosphere, and food. Ordered the spring rolls, miso soup, super crunch roll, and super boost roll. Overall, phenomenal dining experience!"}
{"text":"Just finished eating lunch at Koishi. Ordered the lunch specials. The tuna nigiri was not fresh and the salmon roll was small and tasteless. Service was blah."}
{"text":"Review update!! I just had the worst lunchtime service ever.  It was awful. The waiter was so rude. He told me I couldn't add tofu to any dish (I wanted Hawaiian fried rice with tofu not chicken). So when he said no, I picked plain lo mein and he said \"well you can add tofu to that for a dollar\". What? Ok...whatever.  So I got a huge bowl of $9 lo mein with added tofu for lunch.  He said they are no veggie egg rolls when I've gotten them there before.  So I got a spring roll that was not good.

He never checked on us. Gave me only a tiny serving of hot sauce, didn't refill my water, didn't say thank you when we paid...just a bad experience.   A very rude waiter. 

Sad because this is near work and I would've liked to enjoy it once in awhile. Nope. Not gonna happen now."}
{"text":"Koishi is a classic choice that my parents enjoy regularly - and I always like visiting when I'm in town.  The menu is expansive with sushi, stir fry, Chinese and Japanese entree choices.

I usually go for the sushi - and in this case, ordered the Just Pete roll and a yellowtail scallion roll, both with brown rice.

The sushi is always a great mix of textures and flavors - and I like that there's creative use of smoked salmon in several of the rolls.

There are a ton of signature maki to choose from - you could order a new roll every time you visit and not run out of options until the 7th or 8th visit.

The only downside is that the interior lacks some personality, but when the food is so tasty, you don't really notice.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a few times, but finally decided to pop in to this Pizza Hut building turned sushi spot, and I'm glad I did. It's very unassuming from the outside, but the inside has a more intimate feel to it. Sure it's not decorated, or laid out the same as other sushi spots in CLT, but I was impressed by the food. 

I started with a veggie spring roll, which was mostly comprised of cabbage (there were other veggies in there too), but it was delicately fried and you could actually taste the vegetables rather than oil and mush. Then, being that it was my first time here, I went with two staple rolls that I always try at any spot - spicy tuna and California (granted I also didn't have a huge appetite and some other rolls were massive!). Both were on the smaller side, but the tuna was fresh and delicate, and I appreciated that the roll was just spicy tuna, no other fillers. Overall, the sushi was tasty, and I honestly loved the price points....much more reasonable for the same rolls than other spots closer to uptown. I definitely will be back to try some different rolls!"}
{"text":"Yelp let me down on this one.  There is nothing special about this place.  The menu is small and predictable.  The food was average.  We went for lunch.  There were 5-6 other tables already seated.  There were 2 servers running tables so it was not busy enough to cause the poor service.  We were not greeted when we entered, even though they were standing by the door, they never introduced themselves, they never came back to the table to top off drinks, check how we were doing, see if we needed anything, nothing.  Bad service, poor menu, and average food is not what expected."}
{"text":"I really like this place for sushi. It's not the trendiest, but also, not sooo expensive and THE FISH IS ALWAYS FRESH. I always get sushi (raw fish) and have eaten there for years and never been disappointed.

Personally, I think it's underrated b/c it's in a pizza hut building and not downtown."}
{"text":"Met my daughter here for dinner tonight. We've been here a few times. I like this place. We've only had the sushi. It's fantastic! Tonight was spicy tuna, the Rainbow & the Super Crunchy role. All fresh, all tasty. I loved the Super Crunchy role with 2 large fried shrimp at the ends. The meal was delivered quickly and eaten even faster! Reasonably priced. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We have become Friday night regulars (with a few other days of the week thrown in for fun, on occasion).  Service is always excellent and the food is consistently good.  Great flavor and beautiful presentation.  Don't be fooled by the exterior, this place is well worth the visit!  Your review helps others learn about great local businesses."}
{"text":"Cherry blossom roll is a must, probably my favorite sushi roll ever.  Place is very unassuming-used to be a pizza hut-but I've never had a bad meal.  Service and food is consistently good & they frequently put out coupons so it's even better! :)"}
{"text":"I didn't even get to eat there, as they only accept parties of 6 or more. I've never heard of such a thing, but the place is small (although it was a Pizza Hut at one time). We will not bother again."}
{"text":"Not accommodating at all. Poor service. 

The first time I went, I ordered sushi and asked for a side of brown rice...they told me they couldn't do that. The second time I went, I asked for a sushi roll with a side of steamed broccoli...they said they couldn't do that either (meanwhile they are bringing out broccoli sides for other customers with their full meals). They told me the only way I could get broccoli is if I ordered the full steamed broccoli meal. 

Needless to say I left without even placing my order. It's sad that they lost a potential frequent customer over something as simple as a side dish."}
{"text":"Good sushi, nice intimate enviornment. You can tell that it used to be a pizza hut with the shape of their building, but the inside definitely doesn't remind you of pizza hut at all! They recently rennovated it to be a more modern and young feel with colored-lights, which I find appealing. 

The sushi is yummolicious! I love their volcano roll! If you love baked scallops and imitation crab meat with lots of spicy mayo, this is your roll! I also love the grasshopper roll with shrimp tempura and seaweed salad on top.What an interesting combination right? It's delicious. If you want something visually appealing, I would go with the cherry blossom roll. You'll see why when you get it! 

As for the Chinese dishes, I don't care too much for them. I don't know if this restaurant loves to use sugar, but their sauces are all a bit sweet. If you go here, I would stick to the sushi and stay away from the Chinese."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time Monday, nice cozy lil spot , nice decor the good was good  I have to go a few more times to give an in depth review so far so good though .."}
{"text":"After a few months, decided to try Koishi again and had to note some changes. Still no egg roll substitutions, still fairly small sushi portions, still kind of cold on the service - but they definitely decreased the wait time, and from what I can tell completely nixed the bento box.

(For the lunch sushi combos) A nice portion of salad came out first, with the same really good dressing. Before I could even finish my salad, a small plate with my 2 rolls of small 4-5 pieces each arrive, along with an eggroll and dipping sauce on another plate. A mildly less than fresh smell from the fish and the tempura shrimp smelled like they either needed to change their oil or had switched to a more pungent type - kept getting hints of concession stand fryer-ness, a little odd. 

I don't think I can up the stars because really, it still is just \"a-ok\" in my book. Water sat empty for a little bit, some rolls are below par for lunch sushi - but it's still a decent meal for a decent price.  If I go back I think I'll branch away from sushi and look into their entrees."}
{"text":"Overall, everything was okay. I arrived at 12 on Sunday afternoon and there was only one other customer in the restaurant. I decided to order a few things to get a good taste. I started with the miso soup, just okay, and the spring roll, which was very disappointing. The vegetables inside tasted stale, or very bland. Would pass on that next time. On to the sushi. I ordered a salmon hand roll & it was awesome. The salmon was fresh & the rice steamed to perfection. I definitely enjoyed. I chose the Cherry Blossom roll and really enjoyed it. The only disappointing thing was the fried shrimp was almost non-existent. A little more shrimp would have made it perfect. Overall, as I said, ok."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times. The first time, our server didn't know what toro was. Umm... For realzies? Outside of that, service was acceptable. Sushi was okay.
The second time, the service was slower than a geriatric slug. It was stupid ridiculous. Sushi was okay.
Third time, service was acceptable and sushi was okay. Why did I keep going back? The second time, the wait at New Zealand was too long. The third, my friend convinced me to give it one more try. Hmm. That was and will be my last visit."}
{"text":"What a great quiet little spot! We eat here quite a bit and they are always friendly and the food is great. The sushi is fresh and their selection is vast. I recommend the Super Crunch Roll and the Hawaiian fried rice."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  It's super close to where I live, it's on the way home from places I go.  I'm posting this because I want them to be better.

I went in the first time to a packed restaurant, sat around a lively bar, chatted with a regular about the tempura, left having thought I found my new favorite spot.

The next two times I went in, things were just weird.  The restaurant was eerily quiet.  There were three iPods laying out by a sound system, but there was no music playing.  It took a really long time to be seated, though there were plenty of seats.  The last time I was seated, I watched SEVEN employees outnumbering the customers) stand around looking at their phones, chatting with each other, and blankly staring off into space while I waited for service.  I started making eye contact with servers, trying to signal.  No one in this tiny restaurant even acknowledged me for over 10 minutes.  

Finally, I got my glass of wine to sip while I ordered takeout.  A server sat down right next to me (in an almost empty restaurant, with plenty of tables to choose to work from) and started rolling silverware.  In fact, she was pushing her flatware pyramid against my notebooks and papers I was working on.  There were so many other open tables, why was this happening?  The dead silence didn't help.  

The portions are small, and I always leave feeling like I didn't get my money's worth.  I would almost be ok with that if the place was at all cool to hang out in.  I've tried to like this place.  It's a shame."}
{"text":"I'm always on a sushi hunt in Charlotte. There's cheaper places like Ru San's and then there is Pieces and Cowfish, I wanted something in the middle. Middle being not too fancy, not too pricey, and I also wanted it to be fresh and taste good. 
Koishi, you did it ! I'm glad we decided to try this place. I've never heard much about this little place across the street from Cotswold shopping center, so I almost didn't give it a chance. 
We were greeted and sat down right away. The decor is a lot nicer than Ru Sans  and Akahana ( In Plaza). Our waiter was kind and recommended a few rolls.
We split the Pink Floyd, Giant Saporo Roll and a Philly Roll. Basically inhaling out rolls we were stuffed, happy and will definitely try this place again. 

They also have other Asian/ Chinese food options."}
{"text":"For an old pizza hut building, they really did a nice job inside to convert the space into a classy asian restaurant.

There's a sushi bar just inside the door facing the kitchen, booths on either sides and a few tables in the middle.

The dinner group met here last night (and for once everyone showed up).  This was my 2nd attempt at sushi.  I started with the seafood hot and sour soup.  The soup was good but i didn't really care for the seafood addition.

I also ordered the King Tuna roll which was tasty.  The rolls weren't as big as my first experience with sushi at Cowfish but they it was still good.  Next time I come back here, Ill know to order more.

Others around my table seemed to be satisfied with their meals. The person next to me went for the General Tso's chicken which was beautifully presented and another person went for a noodle dish that came in a very cute bowl.  

Service was excellent here and I can definitely see myself returning here."}
{"text":"Well this is such a nice restaurant the food is so good and fresh. I love the Chinese food"}
