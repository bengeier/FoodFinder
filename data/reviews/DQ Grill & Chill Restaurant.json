{"text":"I love this DQ! I come here with my daughter at least once a week and have tried the chicken fingers and bacon cheeseburgers and everything is hot, fresh and delicious. I'd come here for a burger any day over a burger joint. Always cheap and the staff have been very friendly and accommodating. My daughter enjoys the blizzards here and the arctic rush slushies r my fave! Highly recommend this place for fast food eats and treats."}

{"text":"Disgusting place! Owner cheaps out on a regular basis.
I cannot believe they took no responsibility for a lighter in a cake!
Guests got sick?!
This place should be shut down, he is wrecking DQs name..."}
{"text":"I do not even want to give one star to the place as it is serving burnt out food to customers and on complaint their response is the other one will be the same. This they told me after calling me back from home. The staff was super rude, impolite and actually insulted me in front of all customers. Shame on you guys. No wonder we don't see customers visiting DQ. It was my 2nd unfortunate visit and will never visit the place again."}
{"text":"If you like waiting forever this is the place for you. Been multiple times the only reason it gets 2 stars is because it's still a DQ cheeseburger other than that. Randy and his cheeseburger eating ass from trailer park boys would avoid this place"}

{"text":"Look, your kids are nice and polite and quick and all but ...

Stir my damn Blizzard long enough that all the good bits go to the bottom, too, OK? 

It sucks to spend five bucks on a single friggin' ice cream when you get halfway to the bottom and all you have left is plain, old, sucky soft serve.

Argh.

{"text":"This particular Dairy Queen location is tucked away on the corner of 26 Ave Ne and 36 St NE, right beside Pizza 73 and across from Sunridge Mall.

I wanted to try their new Artisan Philly Sandwich that DQ have been promoting all over the social media and today I finally had my chance to try one. Typically when I visit DQ I'm geared towards their ice cream cake but for this particular visit it's for another reason. 

I finally get to see what all the hype is about and took my first bite, the sandwich is decent. Prepared warm but didn't stimulate my tastebuds as I thought it would. With the sandwich featuring thinly sliced steak pieces, Monterey Jack cheese, roasted green and red peppers, and onions served on an oven baked artisan style bun this is way off on what a real Philly Cheese Steak would taste like but then again it is DQ's own spin.

I wouldn't recommend the sandwich to anyone since it's not worth the hype but the location on the other hand is a must visit since the staff is friendly and efficient"}
{"text":"This is an old-time Dairy Queen, like it was spared from the last three or four decades and kept in its original form. It still says Dairy Queen out front, not the trendy and hip \"DQ\", plus they still attract old 50s car enthusiasts who meet in the parking lot on hot summer nights like they did in the 60s....

This particular location has a pretty decent selection of cakes and although their burgers are okay, the cakes are Dairy Queen's real strength. The cookie crumble and fudge in the middle is the secret I think and the vanilla ice cream on top makes the whole thing. If you need to take a cake somewhere you'd be wise to get an ice cream cake. It avoids any awkward moments with diabetics and everybody loves ice cream cake. Except maybe the lactose intolerant. But Dairy Queen has treats for them too....

Anyway, the cake is the thing and at $22 for a large one, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Bad service. People behind the counter behave like robots. Frowns everywhere. It's almost they hate being there."}

We shared a small and let's just say...I will be working out more so I can have some more of this amazing blizzard. IF YOU ARE A PEANUT BUTTER and CHOCOLATE LOVER, YOU WILL FREAKING LOOOOVVVEEEE THIS!!!! 

The service was fast and friendly. Best part of this experience is that they actually do the signature DQ blizzard test of tipping your blizzard upside down and showing that it won't plop out. =)"}
{"text":"Haven't been to a DQ in years, I had a McFlurry (or whatever Dairy Queen calls it) and my husband had a fudge sundae. Service at drive thru was polite and quick, the ice cream wasn't that good- too watery, not creamy enough."}

{"text":"We live just down the street from this location and have been through both the drive thru and dining room for ordering. The service is slow and mostly unfriendly staff. I would say out of a dozen visits they have gotten our orders right 50% of the time. We have experienced receiving hamburgers without the actual hamburger patty, blizzards with hardly anything in them but ice cream, boxed dilly bars with only 5 in the box. I also ordered chilli cheese fries one time through the drive thru only to get half way home to see the grease seeping through the bag onto my leather seats because they did not put the fries with chilli and melted cheese in a container with a lid. If it wasn't for my kids loving the sundaes we would never return."}

{"text":"I know, you're thinking that a 5 star review for a fast food joint doesn't seem quite right. But as far as fast food chain restaurants go, this place offers a little something extra that even some of the best restaurants in town could learn from. 

I took an out of town visitor to Dairy Queen tonight with the hopes of finding an \"Oh Henry\" flavoured Blizzard. Unfortunately, this isn't one of their stock flavours, but never fear, the extremely kind older gentleman behind the counter is extremely accommodating and suggested that if we were to go out and purchase an Oh Henry chocolate bar, he would custom make the desired Oh Henry Blizzard for us!

When we returned with our coveted chocolate bar, the same gentleman flashed us a huge grin and made the best damn Oh Henry Blizzard this town has ever seen. The Blizzards were packed with flavour and were made without crazy wait period. And true to the DQ way, they even flipped it upside down when they served it to us! Now that's what I call going a little above and beyond to make the customer happy. 

This helpful gentleman appears to run the place, and he was extremely kind, had a great sense of humour and as has a beautiful smile. I was absolutely impressed with my visit to this particular Dairy Queen and even though it is not the closest location to my house, the smile we got makes it worth the extra drive!

{"text":"After a bad experience with the Markham Rd. and Hwy 7 experience (find my yelp review for that), I went to this location.

I needed to order a custom cake for my daughter's 1st birthday. The store was clean and looked relatively new and the staff was helpful in answering inquiries.
They had a book of designs right on their counter which made it easier for me to glance through and choose a cake. The ordering process took about 5 minutes, which I appreciated.  

I called the store a few days later to ask if they had eggs in the strawberry cheesecake ice cream we had ordered, since selective attendees coming to the party were allergic to eggs. The staff was able to answer my question quickly. They said there were eggs in the cheesecake and that they would remove the cheesecake portion while still giving me fresh strawberries in the cake. That was very accommodating! 

The owner proactively told me that I could order cakes online and pay at the store. The customer service was exceptional. 

Thanks to this DQ for helping to make my baby's 1st day memorable! Th e cake turned out exactly like the picture, they did an excellent job.

I will definitely return to this Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to write but Dairy Queen is very popular. I haven't tried everything but their ice cream cakes aside from the sundaes are the best. Expensive but worth it. 

Ps. Best part is the drive thru in this location."}
{"text":"Not sure how the chain is still alive.
I went in placed my order no smile
They where to busy being kids .
Order was ice cream it was $5.25
I over paid because it was that bad.......
They once where the giant but have gone down hill
Will never go back to that chain.."}
{"text":"We came late on a Sunday night, as they were about the close. Fun fact: I am a huge fan of blizzards. However, I was not very impressed by what they served us. We ordered a strawberry cheese cake blizzard and a salted caramel blizzard. Not sure if they used soft serve, but when we got our blizzards, the ice cream was runnier than expected. The strawberry cheesecake had little to no cheesecake pieces in it, and they just used strawberry jam. They should've named it strawberry jam disappointment instead of strawberry cheesecake blizzard.  The salted caramel blizzard was very chocolaty; I didn't taste any salted caramel pieces. Overall, the blizzards were a big disappointment. I have had blizzards at other diary queens, and they were definitely better than the ones served at this location."}
{"text":"If you care about customer service, don't even look at this place. I'd like to actually say whomever is managing this place needs to be schooled!
Also, the people that work here have no personality. Hellen Keller has more of a personality than the employees at this place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service!! Great Food!!! Excellent Staff!!!

The store is warm friendly and inviting."}
{"text":"Average Dairy Queen

MY service and food were average for Dairy Queen, which is a bit slower than other fast food places, but since the burgers are a bit better than other fast food places, I accept it. I observed unreasonably slow service and inaccuracy of service for other customers, and their annoyance with this."}

|| My Experience:  

I'm a fan of Dairy Queen, but this location makes the experience that much better. If I'm near another Dairy Queen, I will literally drive out of my way to come to this specific location. 

The service here is always top notch. Even when I arrived just as they were about to close one time (got there at 10:59 pm), they not only let me in, but still gave some great service and quality. They could easily have given me attitude or shown frustration that they're work day was pushed longer, but they stayed friendly and professional. They are also very helpful with creating custom items that you may want to make. 

This is also the cleanest location I've ever been to, rarely a mess found around the shop."}
{"text":"The worst DQ in Calgary hands down. Everything is watered down , the portions are tiny, slow service ran by cheap Asians."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this new location.  Had a Reese's royal blizzard that was awesome but the 2 stars is for service.  When did it become the norm not to say \"hello\" and \"thank you\" to customers?  The girl at the window greeted me with saying $4 something (for my blizzard) and not even a hello.  Zero personality whatsoever. When she handed me my card back I said thank you and not a word from her. Then when she gave me my icecream,  I said thank you a little bit louder and all she said was \"have a nice day\" and shut the window.  What is with kids nowadays?!?!"}
{"text":"Let me say first that I like Dairy Queen in general.  However, this location is the pits.  Wrong orders, and slow service abounds.  I'm currently writing this review while sitting in the drive through line.  7:30pm on a nice Saturday evening, and its taken them almost 25 minutes to serve 7 cars.  It's burgers and ice cream - how long can this take?  This kind of pokey service seems to be a running theme at this location."}
{"text":"The staff is always grumpy. Hard to get your drinks refilled and you rarely get the order how you wanted it. Save yourself a bad time and take a trip to a different DQ, you'll appreciate it. My boss would kill me if we were this dismissive about our customers."}
{"text":"This is the review that you never want to write. When you've found the most wonderful gem of a restaurant surrounded in a sea of Chinese restaurants, hidden just slightly out of the way, where the service is exceptional and the food without fail. Interestingly, it is a Dairy Queen, which offers mostly burgers and fries. 

You walk in and are greeted with a smile. Return customers are remembered from past visits; but they never presume to know what you are about to order. They very patiently waited to take your order and didn't rush, make suggestions or present themselves as  anything but nice and courteous. 

As you wait for your order, you will notice that the restaurant is clean and presentable. The only issue thus far was getting a parking space out front because there are not many of them. This can't be blamed on the restaurant. 

Your order comes out hot! Although, some orders come with ice cream, they will ask you whether you want to wait on it, so, you can enjoy your hot food first, and then they will make your cold dessert. This is appreciated, so that the ice cream doesn't melt. When, you arrive back up to the counter to collect your dessert, THEY REMEMBER YOU AND WHAT YOU WANTED FOR DESSERT!!!! KUDOS!

Sadly, your meal must end. People who live in the real world will bus their own trays; however, prince and princesses or Royals, as I like to call them will just leave. Those trays are quickly cleaned up and the table is prepared for the next guest. No matter what your social status, everyone is thanked for their patronage."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews for fast food, but this particular branch really needs one just to let everyone know that this place isn't just a \"Dairy Queen\", it's a \"Dairy Queen Restaurant\". 

It really stands out because they have burgers, fries, hotdogs, and all that junk we all love. Is it just me who's impressed coz I don't see this kinda thing often.  So if anyone out there is saving money and wants to fill their daily calorie intake in one meal, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Hot Eats?  Skip them. 
Cool Treats? YES, PLEASE!

For those of you not versed in Diary Queen lingo, 'Hot Eats' refers to their burgers, fries, etc. You know, normal fast food junk. Skip it, it's pretty gross and definitely not what keeps them in business.

Their \"Cool Treats\" on the other hand, definitely worth your time. The cookie dough blizzards are absolutely delicious. This location has a drive-thru so you don't even have to get out of your car (score one for the lazy!)

Things to watch for - before they hand you your blizzard they ALWAYS turn the cup upside down to show you that the ice cream won't fall out of the cup...I'm not really sure WHY that's a good thing, but it's trade mark dairy queen move, and I like it."}
{"text":"i bought an ice cream cake from this DQ location last night.  this DQ has that awesome smell when you walk inside.

{"text":"Eat here if you want to die from nasty old food.

The ice cream rocks, but their food sucks as much as their commercials do."}
{"text":"This place is kind of like a run down place with insufficient lighting, making atmosphere really gloomy.  The server was quite nice.  The burger was not that good even for fastfood standard.  The icecream sundae was really smooth and velvety.  The freezers make such loud noise it was a little annoying, maybe maintenance is needed for the freezer.  Overall, I think they should focus on what they are good at which is ice cream related products and forget about making mediocre hot food."}
{"text":"I just had the most remarkable drive thru experience at this location. I regret not getting our drive thru host's name because he was very friendly and was clearly happy to be at work (which is something I'm not sure I've seen in a drive thru yet since I started driving through them). He asked all the right questions about lids, ketchup, and was incredibly efficient all with a smile on his face and great jokes. 10/10 and made great blizzards to boot."}
{"text":"Convenient location close to our house. Product is the same everywhere so will have to rate on service.

Think the girl we had was a little new so took a little bit to ring everything in as I had a coupon. Appreciated that she took the time to make sure she had everything correct though before putting the order through. Took a little longer than normal to get the order but watching her I could see how careful she was being to get everything just so and correct. Noticed the other guy on the counter watching what she was doing and was on hand to help if she asked. Nice team work you dont always see in fast food.

Love the ice-cream from DQ and the shakes are really good. Consistent quality every time we come and service has always been friendly."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru ever.  I went thru about a month ago. Ordered a combo and two burgers during my half hour lunch break. After over a 10 minute wait and waving my arms around trying to get they're attention (I'm sure they saw me) a girl finally popped open the window, blurted 'they're being made' and closed the window without giving me a chance to respond. One of the reasons I was trying to get they're attention was to let them know I didn't want pickles. Another girl cones back and hands me the bag...I told her I was unhappy about the very long wait and would she compensate for it...? She rudely responds with a \"WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT?\" As I turn to my daughter to ask what she'd like...she interrupts and says \"I can't give you anything anyway sorry\" without even going to speak to a manager. Arrived back at work and opened the bag and one of the burgers was missing. Lots of back and forth between DQ  head office and the location. George the manager finally leaves a message a few days later. I call him back and not only did I not get an apology...he defends his staffs bad service and insists that the girl went to find out if she could compensate us. UGH!  He says he'll mail  a gift certificate for a combo. A month later I receive a gift certificate in the amount of $8.00. The exact price of the burger. Going to give the gift card to a kid who can use it at SOME OTHER DAIRY QUEEN. What an insult!"}
{"text":"I had given this Dairy Queen a 1 star review for receiving a mouldy hamburger bun, but it has been suspiciously deleted. Either way, I have been disappointed with the service and food from this particular location."}
{"text":"I have a slight obsession with Reese's Peanut Butter cups and asked that my Blizzard be filled with \"an unreasonable nonsensical amount of Reese's...\" and they delivered!! I laughed way too hard at my receipt and shared with scores of friends. 

Thank you @DQ for not judging me!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite place for ice cream growing up was DQ but they ended up closing down the one back home so haven't been to one in a while. It had a different feel then the typical old school diner DQ I remember, having a little more stylish update look. the chicken strip basket was pretty good not better then raising canes or chickenbonz but did the spot and was plenty filling.  As for the ice cream treats like the dilly bars, DQ sandwiches a bit smaller then I remember and now premade and boxed up. Where was the big white DQ bag with each individually wrapped frozen treats? I guess its good, customers don't have to wait for them to be made but that's what separated them from store bought ice cream

Anyways they still have the blizzards, sundaes, dipped cones, and banana splits.  Don't forget the waffle bowls. The workers at this location was pretty friendly and let's us stay until we finished even though they were closed. 

If you go online and sign up for the blizzard fan club they always offer buy one get one free for blizzards.  Never tried an Orange Julius before so i'll try it next time"}
{"text":"Received a gift card for Dairy Queen and voila!  I attended this location to enjoy their lunch special with the family.  Quick service, clean establishment and a sunny outdoor eating area.  Love it!  Their ice cream cake selection is large and in plain view.  This makes it easier to decide or choose your next party cake.  I am sure to come back and get a cake...just because!"}
{"text":"Dairy Queen is one of my favorite \"fast food\" places because the food is pure, tastes great and makes a great to go meal or dine in meal. Only one problem why I rate it 4/5 is because the food comes in and goes out...if you know what I mean...Anyway it's a great restaurant and the customer service is always nice there!"}
{"text":"I came here to pick up some food for my kids today. The food here is pretty good and the service is great. The owner is super friendly and we always have a nice chat. I always get my son's birthday cake from here and he loves it. I would like to come here more often but I find the parking situation not too good and I hate having to do a left turn back onto Kennedy Rd, to go north back home. Sometimes I'm stuck there for more than 10 minutes, waiting to turn left. Otherwise, I would come here more often because the food and service are really good at this location."}
{"text":"We do come where often, especially when they have the 99cent blizzard. This instance I was in charge of dessert for Easter and was lazy, besides who doesn't love a DQ ice cream cake. 

We went with a blizzard cake instead of the regular to try something different. It now explains the allergens in each layer of cake...still being unsure of the terminology, we asked the owner, who i super sweet and always there. In the cake we got the only part I couldn't eat was the cookie filling, which is fine by me. She was super helpful and able to answer any questions we had. 

I'm glad to see fast food places are becoming more aware of food allergies, other than peanuts."}
{"text":"This DQ is in my hood and my usual time to visit this location is late at nite.  For years - not matter what time I was there, the owner was there.  Ownder is super nice, friendly, treated her staff well 

Not sure if the store has changed hands or not, but the manager that I encounter now on the late nite shift shows no resemblance to the owner.  She is cold as ice, little respect for her staff - so totally understandable that the staff don't seem happy to be there.

I started this review on June 29th because I was so unhappy with the service and quality of my food.  However, after eating at this location for 25+ years, I felt that one bad experience did not warrant a negative review.  

Tonite I returned, again late in the evening and had the same negative experience.  Quality of food matches the cold as ice attitude.  

I sincerely hope YOU have a better experience at this location than me.   For myself, I will from now on, take the extra minutes and drive to the Dalhousie location."}
{"text":"Second and definitely LAST time we will ever go to this Dairy Queen. First time was nervous about the neighborhood, next door to a pub where the drunks hang out and are scary to say the least. We decided to try again, this time a bit sooner in the  evening. Was quite pleased to see that they had a promo on for blizzards, Buy one at regular price, receive a second one of equal or lesser value for .99\"  Okay, great! We ordered 2 XL blizzards and were told \" just to let you know, the XL size is not included\"  Fine, we still wanted them. While waiting several minutes for our blizzards, I looked everywhere to see where it said XL was excluded. NO WHERE TO BE FOUND! I walked up to the cashier and very politely asked her where is was stated that XL was not included. She stated it was what her boss told her. I still kept my cool and told her it was false advertising Andy wanted a price adjustment. She got scared and kept telling me she wasn't allowed to. Her boss would be in at 9pm and if we gave our name and phone, he would call us. I don't think so! I did not want to make a scene and told her I would be contacting the BBB and DQ head office. She quickly opened the till and gave us back some money. As there were other people waiting in line, I quietly stated to her, it wasn't her fault, but if the company is having a promotion, and the \"boss\" decided to change the promo, he had better advertise it. Turned me off DQ all together."}
{"text":"I'm convinced that this is the best Dairy Queen in the city. I have visited the one in the Beltline a few times, and I'm certain they go out of their way to express just how inconveniencing I am for coming in and ordering. Not so at this one.

This DQ still operates with primarily teens in what is likely their first job on the front lines. Unlike other businesses that have this, though, the restaurant management has what seems to be great training and oversight. Everyone I've encountered there in the occasional quest to quell a Blizzard craving seems to actually give a crap about their job. It's a nice experience.

Feeling like you need an ice cream or a banana split on the way home from a summer day in the mountains? Forget the usual over-crowded stop in Cochrane. This is your huckleberry."}
{"text":"How is Dairy Queen even serving food? I came here for lunch on my break and I regretted it instantly. I ordered a chicken marinara sandwich and it was gross. Not only did it take forever to make but I literally took three bites and threw it away. It was that bad! Not only is the food bad, the service was atrocious and food was way over priced for what you get. Dairy Queen needs to stick to ice cream. Sadly, even that was awful for me. I ordered a cookie dough blizzard, it was so melted and milky, it was nothing like a blizzard and more like a cookie dough juice. 

Never ever again! You can catch me somewhere else, even for dessert"}
{"text":"I love Dairy Queen but there is certainly a variation in quality from location to location due almost entirely to customer service. This location is not high on my list. I have only been here a few times but I have not been very satisfied with the customer service. Just today I ordered a mini blizzard and asked for peanut butter sauce in it. I was informed they didn't have any at that location. I asked if they didn't need it for their Reese ice cream pizza? I was then told that they do have it but they were currently out. Whether or not this was true I felt it was a lie. Also my blizzard was not filled to the top when I got it which feels like a bit of a ripoff especially when it was a mini size to begin with. I will try this location again with hopes the experience will improve.

Well I returned and was unimpressed yet again. When I entered the restaurant it was practically abandoned. I stood at the counter for about 2 minutes and there was no one around to serve me. I finally shouted \"Hello?\" and banged on the counter. A woman emerged from the back and immediately got defensive, insisting she had only been away from the counter for \"1 second\". Perhaps she doesn't know how long a second is? Anyway I got my mini blizzard and once again it was under filled. I am lowering my rating from 3 stars to 2, this place just gets worse and worse. Sad."}
{"text":"Not much variety, slow service, but i love DQ.  that's the only reason they got three stars, but location deserves no star"}
{"text":"Family Traditions: DQ Ice Cream Cake for birthdays! Customer services was not bad , wasn't very good either. Best part is the smiles on my daughter's face when she sees her Dora the Explorer cake with butterflies! 

Under $40 for a 8\" round Blizzard birthday cake. 

Not too sweet-grandparents approved!"}
{"text":"Yum! Grew up eating dairy Queen since I was a kid!! Still same great flavour, and there's just more and more choices for blizzard flavours! 

I still love the simple strawberry sundae. During the summer this location is quite busy with lots of kids, soccer teams that come.  

I decided to try their funnel cake today since I saw it on TV, and it looked really good.  Unfortunately it was very disappointing.  It was a little over 6 bucks, but not big at all, it was stale, and it seems like it was premade and just put into a microwave! 

I don't want to rate this place just on this product, but stick with their basics that has made dairy Queen who they are and you will leave with happy tummies!!"}
{"text":"got chocolate dipped cone in medium and my friend got large 
THE LARGE IS GIANT 
looks like a mountain
pretty standard chocolate dipped cone 
my other friend got a combo and it had a burger drink and ice cream and only $5 so a good deal
however interior design is a little sketch 
but the cashier was patient even though we took a long time to order and my friend farted and it was very stinky. he was still nice so props to him"}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary about this place, although i must say the management are very kind and the food is always served hot. The only con i must say is if you go early the food takes a while to be prepaired (for fast food expectations)"}
{"text":"Good local Dairy Queen.  Has been here forever and delivers good comfort items like blizzards and 99 cent flame broiled hamburgers."}
{"text":"Your usual DQ, service is quite slow and the staff don't seem to communicate very well. I have only come here for ice cream, I doubt I will try their savoury menu...They do ice cream well. My favourite is their ice cream with the crunchy chocolate shell sauce ontop. Very nice to sit on the patio during hotter temperatures."}
{"text":"Okay first I go here every Friday and I have never seen this lady but she is so rude. My puppy and I go and order a pup cup for him and I get a buzzard. I told them I have a free one because they messed up last time and they say no your name was crossed out. I was like no I NEVER got it! She does not care at all and probably does not even believe me but whatever I decide to pay for it because I want it and I'm already in line. Then I get it and she or someone makes it wrong so I turn around and go back through. She was like \"I'm the one who took your order I know what you got\" I was like \"yes and I get this every week so I know what it tastes like\" she's like \"I will remake it but it will taste the same\" like seriously lady how in the world did you become a manager here! Oh wait that's probably the only job you will ever get!"}
{"text":"A pretty good place to come for a tasty treat.  There are always new items coming out, and monthly special Blizzard flavours.

Their service is fast, although they have limited hours (not open past 9pm)."}
{"text":"Fairly standard DQ location. It's definitely an older location that had an exterior facelift when the plaza was renovated years ago. You can tell when you step inside.

I wouldn't go to DQ for their \"hot eats\" as they like to call it, but I'd come for the occasional \"cold treat\" in the summertime. Their Blizzards are still on point as always. 

On a nice day, there can be substantial lineups at this location, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Loves this location;) There are typically 15 year olds working the drive thru (never been inside) and each and everyone of those kids is pretty much the most pleasant, polite and helpful kid I've ever met. The manager must be an amazing judge of character because I've never had a negative experience here. The lines are sometimes long (i.e. Sun afternoons) and when I get up to the window, there is an apology and a blizzard awaiting me. But I'll always brave the line up knowing there is a smile waiting at the end. Unfortunately I have moved from this part of town and I'm cutting back (have you ever looked up the amount of calories in a blizzard?) but whenever I come this way I do check them out and I urge you to too!"}
{"text":"Great cake selection! There was so many options and I had no problem with their customer service."}
{"text":"We always have to tell the person at the window to please make sure to mix the blizzard all the way through. Even after we do so, it is only mixed halfway through the cup of ice cream. It is disappointing because nobody buys a blizzard only expecting half of it to be mixed properly and the bottom half to contain only vanilla ice cream. After several visits and several experiences that seem to be lazy employee habits, I had to write a review. It's mixing a blizzard people. It's not very difficult."}
{"text":"Apparently it is too difficult to get soft serve without a cone and into a cup. On top of that, to be difficult about it? Been to other DQs and not a problem, just this location has an issue...."}
{"text":"I'm loving the 'queen.  A classic like the peanut buster parfait just can't be beat.  We also tried some of their new Blizzards - the cotton candy is actually quite good (and I'm not a cotton candy guy).  Kudos for having the mini sizes - they're just right and make it so we don't have to stuff ourselves with ice cream (especially good for kids, and those of us adults who don't want to consume a boatload of dairy/sugar calories in a single sitting)

It was a busy Sunday afternoon - probably the first hot one of the year, and our order was taken quickly and filled accurately.  Lots of parking out behind the pub that lives behind the DQ, and some nice outdoor seating.  Can't complain - except that I wish I had something from DQ in front of me again as I type this.."}
{"text":"The $7 meal deal is completely worth it! For 7 bucks you get 3 chicken strips, fries, a drink  and a sundae! 

All the food is always amazing and including ice cream in a combo is just genius! 

Ice cream cakes are also delicious! Watch out for the sales! A couple times a year they have 50% off cakes! This usually falls around December and a few other times! 

Definitely recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been here countless times due to close proximity to the house. 
The venue is clean, the staff are attentive and you can always find a seat at this location and extra parking spots behind the pub.
The last time I came here I ended up ordering their traditional chocolate dip cone and before that, their mini blizzards.
However I cannot comment on their food, but have heard it's something to try."}
{"text":"Congratulations DQ.  You managed to prove to me that you have not changed for the better.  I should have known but I foolishly bought into your TV ads.  This place is run-down and the front windows are dirty.  In spite of my initial reaction, I went ahead and order the chicken strips with fries and gravy.  After a 15 minute wait, I was handed a tray with the food in a paper basket. 

The breading was rock hard which means that the chicken was overcooked in the deep fryer. The fries were nothing special and the gravy was also mediocre.  The chicken strips were so hot, I had to gingerly break them apart and allow them to cool so I did not burn my mouth. Needless to say, I will never return to this location nor to any other DQ location.  I truly wonder why this company has not gone out of business. Presumably....it is because they have no real competition for their prime product which is iced milk.  Thankfully there is plenty of alternatives in the burger/fries/coke business."}
{"text":"I think this DQ has the fastest service in the city. They are locationg along a very busy street, so these guys have figured out how to move people along. 

On the inside this DQ looks exactly the same as every other DQ I've ever been to; it's clean, large enough, has easy access, even has a drive thru."}
{"text":"Every once in awhile I end up at DK...not sure why.  The fries are meh...the cheeseburgers are ok.  This time they had some new slushie drinks - I tried the Pina Colada one.  It was ok.  The combo deal cost me $8.  So many better things to buy with $8...that's a goldmine in the Dollar Store!  I wish I could have picked up some of their ice cream bars but I was in a rush from lunch and I think unless they are having a sale the prices are now ridiculous for those dilly bars...or whatever they are called now"}
{"text":"This review is for the location at DAIRY QUEEN BRAZIER
325 Central Pkwy W #52, Mississauga, ON.

The store is dirty and old, homeless people sleep on the bench in front of the store, and the Blizzards always taste terrible. I will never be back!"}
{"text":"They sucked! They didnt cut our treatsa pizza and I ordered a fudge royal brownie blizzard and got a peanut butter blizard. Do they train anyone at the place!"}
{"text":"Very clean new store and the staff was friendly.  Very busy on Saturday night with a lot of parents bringing their kids here for an ice cream dessert.  I got a smoothie which was very good and my wife got a hot fudge sundae.  The sundae is a little Cup of ice cream with a small drizzle of chocolate fudge on top of it.  I emphasize small.  But it looks just like the picture of a hot fudge sundae when you are ordering it, so that was my fault.  The deserts are just too much money for what you get."}
{"text":"Definitely the best dairy Queen location I've been to :) and I love the cotton candy flavor!

The staff are pretty nice here but what sets then apart really is how clean they are. :) I have a much better experience here.

Not much else to say other than great awesome ice cream!!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"This place is a dive. But they have ice cream so they get a star."}
{"text":"Best DQ ever! They have customer appreciation day with almost everything half price! Will recommend!"}
{"text":"Great sunny day for a blizzard but way too many WW points so we won't visit again for a whilel."}
{"text":"Occasionally my wife and I develop a sweet tooth and end up driving to the Dairy Queen located on the corner of Arizona Ave & Chandler Heights for a Blizzard. Last night at 9pm we headed there and were waited on by a young lady name Silvia. She was undoubtedly one of the most professional employees we've had the pleasure of doing business with. When I went to pay she noticed that we were both seniors and immediately recalculated the total and charged us less. I can't remember this ever happening to us with anyone. Besides being very honest and helpful both my wife and I thought that she had the greatest personality. We also think she has a great future head of her. Good job Silvia!!! Thanks again.  PS: Of course the Blizzards there are outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Today as of 10-9-17 I asked a lady what else goes on the Mushroom Swiss Burger. And I also asked her if the beef was fresh or frozen and she didn't know that either."}
{"text":"I usually go to the one in brampton but was close to this one so I'd try it. I ordered a chocolate extreme blizzard. Asked for extra pieces well because I wanted to. I get the blizzard doesn't look nothing like the blizzard I asked for. I was very annoyed. It was vanilla ice cream with chocolate brownies and chucks they didn't even add extra which is what I paid for. I complaint but they told me this was it. I will not be going back to this one. They were in a rush to take your order didn't even give me a receipt and they don't even care about customer service. Such a pain in the ass. Don't go to this place."}
{"text":"Your average DQ, although the staff is a bit slow and sometimes has an attitude towards customers. Other than that the ice cream and the ice cream cakes (my fav) are amazing. If you're a fan of ice cream cakes you'll love Dairy Queens cakes."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest DQ in the world ... The ladies room was a complete wreck and the floors and dining area really needed a cleaning. The to-go Blizzards were tasty, though all of the mix-ins were at the bottom and the top was plain ice cream, and the staff friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I'm guilty of going here constantly as DQ is one of our family favourites. The problem here is the owners are absolutely atrocious. We were in another DQ a week before one of my visits here and were handed all of our blizzards upside down. When I asked she told me that that's how we are supposed to hand them to you or you get it free. They handed me my blizzards right side up here and I was like ... Sweet that means it's free... The owner manager came out and yelled at me and told me (paraphrase here) I was basically an idiot. 

Seems like the treats are all a little bit smaller here as well. 

Unfortunately with no DQ alternatives around we will go back but not because of service."}
{"text":"After buying a $40 ice cream cake they flat out refused to give any spoons or small sundae paper cups. Remarkable, and good to know for next time."}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream cakes!! Must try. You can get a nice 9 inch cake for about $25. one layer of vanilla ice cream, one layer of chocolate ice cream and a nice cookie crust. Tasty! They also have great blizzards, sugar free chocolate popsicles, and just as awesome vanilla cones with the signature tip. 

Bonus: great service, drive thru option

Opens 11 am - 11 pm daily."}
{"text":"This location opened last weekend. 
We ordered ice cream cones to eat while watching fireworks. We asked a coworker what the different cone sizes meant. So...No one knew a large ice cream cone literally means I get a large cone. I was under the impression I was getting a third ice cream layer. Who new? So for $2.99...nope!"}
{"text":"I grew up in a small town in Northern BC and Dairy Queen was there long before McDonald's showed for the party.  In fact I remember when Blizzards first came out...hmmm does that age me?!

And so DQ holds a special place in my heart and we venture to the nearest DQ when we feel the urge for soft ice cream or a blizzard.

On this day that we visited DQ my son wanted a hot dog.  We maybe eat hot dogs twice a year and he decided he wanted one for supper as it was just the 2 of us.  After a long day of not listening battles I gave in easily as the \"choose your battles\" song rang through my head.  And off to DQ we went for a hot dog.  

While we were there the smell of deep fried onion rings also sang to me and I gave in to the rings for the first time in years.   We grabbed our grub and headed for home to indulge.

While those rings tasted good going in...an hour later the bloating affects of deep fried onion rings set in.

In the end my son was happy with his hot dog (although would have been happier if they would not have put mustard on it) and I remembered why I rarely eat deep fried foods like this.  You can take the girl out of the small town but ya can't take the small town out of the girl ;)."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen is my usual go to for a quick cheap full meal. I have to admit... I love the sundaes here! The Q was perfect on my chocolate sundae and the ice cream was good and firm :)

Hot food is a no go for me at this location though. The chicken strip basket was skimpy at best. Their chicken strips were tiny and half the size from what I get from other locations. The fries were under portioned as well in the box. 

Burgers... Don't get their burgers here unless you want a sloppy mess or a microwaved burger. The mushroom swiss burger was COVERED in mayonnaise; that along with the mushroom sauce just made eating the burger a messy ordeal, it was dripping wet (and not in a good way)!
The single cheese burger I ordered was... Not fresh at all. As I unwrapped it, the bread was sticking to the wrapper and the cheese looked like it was premelted. It was not a solid piece of cheese... But rather looked like it was melded with the burger..."}
{"text":"Fast friendly and great. I love DQ and this one has figured out what service means. I believe the guys name is Jacob I could be wrong but older than high schools talk guy who welcomes everyone with a smile is friendly and always walks around to thank people. Food is hot and fresh ice cream is done well. Love having this place close to the house it's a nice break from the typical of the area."}
{"text":"This place is great. It's clean and the workers are very friendly/helpful. 

I've gotten alot of cakes from here with stupid messages and they've just laughed along. 

They also have half price cakes around December, so its perfect for those random christmas parties. Everybody loves ice cream cakes..."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple times for their blizzards.  

Has a drive-thru window! Bonus!

& now they even have mini blizzards on their menu. yayyy!"}
{"text":"What can you say that hasn't been said about DQ! This is our favourite place to bring the kids for a cool treat. 

The staff at this location is top notch. The restaurant is always clean and they always have smiles on their faces. 

I usually either get a Smarties (thank for bringing that back) Blizzard or the Peanut Buster Parfait.  They always load up on the smarties which is nice. The peanut buster has just the right amount of peanuts to fudge to ice cream ratio. 

I also like getting some of their hot food. Their burgers are great and I love their onion rings. Here's a weird but delicious tip. I like to eat onion rings with my ice cream. It sounds weird but tastes amazing!

With warm weather returning we will be regulars at this DQ"}
{"text":"DOUGLAS SQUARE DQ:

I wish I could give a zero! These people are CHEAP! They are SLOW! and service is rude!

They make the treats smaller and with less toppings then any other DQ I've ever been to! This isn't just a one time occurrence either, it's every time I've gone! We try to boycott this DQ but on occasion the in-laws buy us ice cream and it is ALWAYS disappointing from the Douglasdale location.

Peanut Buster Parfaits are made by barely getting ice cream above lip of the cup, hot fudge is dribbled on plastic so it looks like lots but really not very much. Blizzards are a game of hide and seek to even try and find mixings!

Once I took back my blizzard to the DQ by my house (not Douglasdale) and they couldn't even tell what it was because there was so little toppings mixed in. It just looked like swirled around vanilla ice cream (tasted like it too). 

Just feel so completely ripped off by them! If you do make the mistake of going here, here is the DQ customer relations line so that you can call in to complain about your bad product/service: 1-866-793-7582

Other Reviews on Google:

Do not eat here - we found a melted lighter in our cake! We purchased a birthday ice cream cake. After serving it to a party of people, we started to notice small pieces of melted blue plastic and metal fragments (the metal pieces from a lighter) throughout the ice cream portion of the cake!  My friends/family got very sick off of it; it was likely that plastic, metal, and even lighter fluid was ingested. When we confronted the owners/managers about the cake, the couple that run the place were extremely rude and took absolutely no responsibility. Their exact words were, \"No one smokes here so it's not our fault.\" No apology was offered even though they risked the health of about 20 people. I'm assuming that their ice cream machines have not been cleaned out, so be VERY cautious when eating here - I don't want anyone else to get sick!

Blizzards were waiting when I pulled up after having 3 other cars in front of me. When I opened them at home they were like soup. Management may want to think about timing of frozed desserts as they were basically garbage! Not going back!

I have stopped going to this location as the chocolate milkshakes are *always* essentially chocolate milk."}
{"text":"This location is horrible.  Just a bunch of kids who don't know what they're doing and haven't been trained.  Management or franchisee owner needs to step up to get this place on track.  Milkshake and blizzards were half melted, making them an awful mess, as they were dripping down the sides of our cups.  Blizzards were barely mixed, all the toppings were on top, with nothing but plain ice cream most of the way down.  Very disappointed with this location, as I've been here several times now, and it's not getting better."}
{"text":"I love the burgers here they're not greasy and the fries and gravy are great the price is right and it beats Mickey D's

They added New things to the menu like honey barbeque glaze chicken strips and they have artesian style sandwiches

The ice cream and the desserts are mostly the same but now they've added funnel cake triple chocolate brownie and a fudge stuffed cookie"}
{"text":"I swore to myself I'd do everything in my power to avoid writing a second 1-star review, but I honestly can't restrain myself. It's 2:00 in the morning and I still feel compelled to log in to yelp and share the travesty that occurred.

Now, let's not pretend, dear reader, that fast food places are known for their high quality offerings. No matter where you go - whether the Golden Arches or Arby's (God have mercy on your soul), you should expect the kind of delivery that can only come when apathetic high school kids and people who can't read the knobs on the machinery prepare food for you. 

But that said, you sort of expect them to be subtle about the fact that what they're about to serve you was cranked out of the food equivalent of a puppy mill.

Not so at this DQ.

I arrived in a hurry and ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. Now, do not be deceived by the name. The chicken is not grilled - and I have serious doubts as to how much of it is actually chicken. It IS, for the record, a sandwich.

I watched in horror as, behind the counter, my sandwich was assembled without gloves. I then watched in further horror as the chicken \"patty\" was pulled sloppily out of a little yellow bin and placed on my sandwich. Okay, not too horrific just yet, right?

But then the employee picked up my sandwich, condiments, lettuce, tomato and all - and MICROWAVED IT before sliding it down the adorable little metal chute.

Are. You. SERIOUS!?

I need not dispense with how utterly disgusted the thought of microwaved lettuce/tomato makes me, but I will anyways. 

When you see a beautiful woman, you know what often strikes your eye? Contrast. The same goes for a beautiful burger - the coolness of the lettuce and tomato are supposed to offer a refreshing counterweight to the savory heat of the patty. Instead I got something that looked like it was sat on by the Dairy Queen herself.

Would you serve someone a beer that had been sitting out in the sun for hours by BLOWING on it, hoping to mask the fact that it is in fact a warm, heinous beer?! I certainly hope not. 

I'm actually appalled that my ENTIRE BURGER was just nonchalantly microwaved before my eyes. I don't know if the grilled chicken is a less than popular option. I don't know if they don't move many - but what I DO know is that at peak time (dinner) you should not have to be microwaving your sandwich meats.

If I wanted to pay $5.00+ for an microwaved hamburger I would have walked across the street to the gas station and picked up one of the miserable soggy messes they leave sitting in their coolers for days on end, waiting for someone who has reached their personal all-time-low to come along, pick it up, microwave it and eat it while thinking about all the ways their life went horribly wrong.

The saddest part about this story is that I swallowed my pride and ate the damn thing because I had just come from the gym and desperately needed to have SOME sort of food in my stomach.

Just awful."}
{"text":"ehh, it's a so-so place.
seems the management and overall organization is on the poorer side, they had some trouble getting the order and then they gave the wrong pop (dr pepper instead of Pepsi) 

the blizzards are interesting to try."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this DQ does not live up to the standards of other locations.  Historically, it has not been very clean (particularly behind the counter), service has been slow and the restroom and surrounding area has had a foul odor.  If you absolutely cannot or are too lazy to get yourself to another one nearby, obviously this will have to do."}
{"text":"I rarely end up at this DQ because it's a bit hidden in a residential neighborhood.  My spouse and I took advantage of our most recent Blizzard Club BOGO coupon by stopping by this location for a change.  It's very clean and I like the atrium.  Unfortunately, the service was noticeably slow and the staff appeared to be running around behind the counter like chickens with no heads.  I'm not sure why, as it I wouldn't have considered it to be very busy.  We also noticed that the prices are a bit higher here than other locations we frequent. 

I must add that I tried the French Silk Pie blizzard for the first time last night and nearly died and went to heaven!

{"text":"Just got the $7 meal. Wendys'  next door and I'm glad I came here.. burger and fries tasted like theirs.. and I got a free sundae.. 
this location ice cream cones and parfait cheaper compared to Bathurst location.. has drive they and diner seating..
No issue with customer service"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews for fast food restaurants either but I am so fed up with this location that I feel compelled to put my frustrations in writing.  

I went through the drive-through yesterday with the my kids and the teenager serving us with downright rude and disrespectful.  She couldn't hear my order despite the fact that I had to practically yell it through the drive through speaker and repeat it numerous times and when I finally got to the window to pay, she was not only unapologetic but she continued to be disrespectful and rude.  

I wouldn't normally bother complaining about a disrespectful teenager but this is consistent problem at this location.  All of the staff must be very unhappy to be working there since I have never had prompt, friendly service in all of the years I have been going to this DQ.  I am now so fed up that I promised myself that I will not be coming back and giving them my money (this ice cream is pricey!).  If I ever have a craving for DQ in Richmond Hill, I will give the the newer location at Carville and Bathurst a try.  Hopefully it is run by a different franchisee that actually cares about customer service."}
{"text":"People are crazy for not going here more.  I go pretty regularly during lunch and smash their chicken fingers.  They are awesome.  

DQ is so much more than just ice cream.  The burgers are good too.

I've been to other DQ's but this one is the cleanest place ever.  The employees are super nice, fast and half the time have me sit down and then they bring me my food.

Underated in the fast food world for sure."}
{"text":"Dairy Queen has pretty standardized food so it's hard to complain about the food itself.  But the service.... oh dear.  It was like they were having a good day until you walked in, and now they're forced to listen to your order and actually work.  I have never been treated like I was welcome at this location.  Worse, I went there once to get the $6 meal deal burger.  I went through the drive-through.  When I got home, the burger seemed a bit thin-- there was nothing inside but ketchup and a piece of lettuce.  Mistakes get made-- no problem, luckily I live not far from the restaurant.  When I took it back, I went inside and showed the staff and explained the issue (not rudely at all) and explained that I drove home and it was not properly prepared. She took it back to the food preparers right behind her and showed them, they all had a brief chuckle, made a new one, and handed it to me without saying a word.  Now, that's exactly what I was hoping for, but as a business, it's also good form that if something is your fault, then proper manners says that you should apologize and then make it right.  There was no apology, they just took the burger, had a communal laugh, and then said nothing.  In total I had gone there about 3-4 times and the only time I had good customer service is when I had a new trainee.  In short, I don't think customer service is their top priority, and for that reason I now only go to the DQ in Deerfoot Meadows, they just seem nicer there."}
{"text":"Really glad to have DQ in the neighborhood! We have been here twice so far, and service and food have been great."}
{"text":"Honestly if I could give this place 6 stars I would. The boys (Cam, Chase and I) roll to this DQ for lunch everyday from Monday - Friday. We would each give this lovely establishment 5 stars which would bring our grand total to 15/5 stars if my math is correct. 

The friendly staff consistently greets us with warm smiles and glistening eyes the moment we enter this little taste of heaven. There staff consists of 3 females (names unknown but they're all angels) and a man who is nicer than my Grandma Smith. 

As we approach the register to express our respective orders they say things like, \"just the usual for you?\" Upon delivering our food to the table we now call home, they softly say to us, \"see you tomorrow.\" 

When the mouth watering Chicken Scrips and warm comforting Canadian gravy hits the lips, it clones the feelings of fornicating for the first time. Do yourself a favour and never stray away from purchasing anything but the $7 meal deal. You won't be disappointed. 

If I'm Warren Buffett (part owner of DQ?) I would give all of these employees a fat ass raise and put them all in the Canadian Hall of Fame yesterday. Despite the sketchy individuals (we call them Walkers) that linger the premise during our meal, nothing can stop us from devouring this perfect balance of heated meats and sweet treats. 

Love,

{"text":"Summer + Ice cream = a happy person. I live for this frozen treat throughout most of the year, but it only intensifies in the hotter months. A Blizzard is a soft serve with the consistency of concrete. With a flavor for everybody, not finding one to meet your taste would be more difficult.

Two of my classic favorites are the mint Oreo and the Reese's peanut buttercup. Look no further with these two items on the menu. 

The only complaint is how slow the drive thru is."}
{"text":"okay i go to DQ every single day and I was there with a few of my girlfriends after my movie night, we had a simple order and I was in the passenger seat and trying to give my order through the window. Although it might have been hard to hear I was trying to repeat my order.. As the lady said she knew what size, I was trying to tell her what blizzard I wanted. Then she asks me, what size I wanted again which I already told her. I was not upset that she asked me again, I was upset that she told me to be serious. I was the one who was trying to do what she asked. She was very rude and refused to serve my girlfriends and I. We then had to leave and drive 30 minutes out of our way to get ice cream, because I love Dq and I am a regular costumer. I hope you take this into consideration, my fellow other dq costumers. Do not ever get served my DIANA .. she is the worst server of all time and so disrespectful. Dq I will no longer be a regular costumer because of her. Everyone watch out for DIANA"}
{"text":"After a filling meal at Hopper Hut we still found room for a sweet treat. This location is definitely showing it's age, but the restaurant was pretty clean. The staff were friendly and efficient. Our Blizzards were made quickly. The only thing I can complain about is the fact that the girl didn't turn my Blizzard upside down before handing it to me."}
{"text":"This store lacks in customer service. No smiles, no friendly welcome just bland customer service.  Four words are spoken by the girl at the counter. \"Can I help you\". Placed an order for a sundae.  I did get my order very quickly, so speed is not an issue.  Sat down on the bench took two spoon bites noticed a very long hair embedded in the ice cream.  Noted that the girls at the counter tie up their hair very loosely.  I think hair nets would be very appropriate.  Took the ice cream back.  I could understand if I ate half of the ice cream and took it back with a \"hair in it\" and demanded another one.  However, after only two spoons I could honestly say that there was a hair in it.  When I showed it to the girl who made my sundae she looked at me and said \"yeah but\" and looked at my long hair.  I noted that it was embedded in my sundae and that there is no way I could have put it in the ice cream.  Noting no finger or spoon marks.  Geez I had to prove that it wasn't me.  Seriously after two spoons! She replaced it very quickly but barely any hot fudge and peanuts.  Okay I didn't want to make a scene but they lost a loyal customer. Manger/owner really need to speak to the staff who was on the afternoon of Sunday July 24th.  Attitude all over the place!!!!"}
{"text":"Recently renovated, this location now has more seating for those who want to eat-in at the restaurant. 

Unlike some of the other locations, this one not only serves ice cream and shakes - it has the full food menu - burgers, hot dogs and everything in between as well.

I've come here several times for ice cream, and it never disappoints. The watermelon-strawberry shake is a decent alternative if you want something more refreshing."}

{"text":"I've been a patron of this DQ for several years, whether it's for hockey gatherings, a quick cone or custom birthday cakes, they always deliver with a smile.

As far as DQ goes it's pretty much the same food and icecream novelties you grew up on which is great, the nostalgia gets me every time :) 

The only downside is that service can be a little slow and a renovation needs to happen as the place is looking a little dingy.  

Other than that, do get your kids birthday cakes here, the artist is amazing. I've gotten images done over the years ranging from super Mario, spongebob, angry birds, teenage mutant ninja turtles and more! If the artist can't free hand the image they will do an edible sugar paper one for a nominal charge.

Keep at it Huntington hills DQ! See you soon!"}
{"text":"How much do I love BLIZZARDS?? (rhetorical question.)

...but a lot is definitely the right response. Today six of us went to this location after a beautiful, hot day of intense Mini Golf (yes, it can totally be intense when its your only sport) for some coooool down treats. It's very similar to most DQ's and was at least very clean with speedy service. The order was received well without issue, prepared fast and everyone smiled. Perfect when you just want a quick ice cream (or a Caramel Toffee Nut blizzard to be exact). I was pleased with this location and would return again for sure (I do have one location I would never return to - so it's not always a sure thing.)

{"text":"I've only been to this DQ and the one at Sheppard and Victoria Park. This DQ is a thousand times better than the one at Sheppard.

I never tried the drive thru. There is always plenty of parking space at the back.

Service is the best I've seen for a fast food restaurant. Every single time I've been there I was never disappointed. Burgers take longer to make so they tell you to sit down and they bring the food to you when it's ready. The burgers are always juicy and tasty. The dairy snacks are made with perfection. 

The place is spotless clean. 

I tried the Buster bars, fudge bars and a cake and they were all excellent quality.

There is not a single thing I don't like about this DQ. Go see for yourself!"}
{"text":"After 5 or 6 visits to this location, I am positive this Dairy Queen's employees need to go back to dq college. I agree with several of the previous reviews.
1. Every employee I have dealt with at the drive through have been downright rude.
2. They also need to check the sizes they are dispensing regarding ice cream cones. There is no difference between small, medium and large here. They each come out identical to one another. When I questioned the employee tonight. She took my cone back went around the corner out of sight and then brought the same cone back to me she then told me \"here's your large, have a good night and closed the glass window.....

There are way to many good DQ's around. I will not use this location again."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this location to open up. As soon as I heard about the opening, I was here within 10 minutes. The drive thru service was relatively quick and staffs were friendly. 

I ordered a mint and Oreo blizzard. It was delicious. The pretzels were still hot when I got home. The hot dog is a bit smell, but it definitely hits the spot. 

I will most definitely come back here again."}
