{"text":"Excellent pizza at a decent price. There's a reason why there's usually a line all the way to the door. The best."}
{"text":"If u are looking for a great pizza place with fresh ingredients, great hospitality, very positive atmosphere, then this is the place for you.  I had the meateaters pizza that's comes with pepperoni and meatballs but I substituted for bacon, sausage and pepperoni with roasted garlic, and it was delicious.  Depending on bomber of customers, the pizza prep may take a little time but cooks very fast, less than 3mins.  Also try the blood orange lemonade was really good, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I love every thing about blaze!! The staff is great and the pizza is wonderful. Can't wait to try another pizza"}
{"text":"Y'all this place is 10/10!!! LIIIIIT the staff is da bomb, the pizza was scrumdidliumpsious, and the atmosphere is fiiiiiire."}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is amazing! I find it to be better than Pieology based on their toppings and crust. The toppings are outstanding and the price is very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Will not come back again. Waiting in line for 15 min. Slowest place ever. I don't see this place making it if they don't get faster. Wouldn't be here if not for the BOGO coupon."}
{"text":"So the service was bad. Second in line and waited 10 min for them to start. While about 8 employees were standing around maybe 3 doing something with a line to the door. Food was good. Great price for a personal pizza. Just needs some management changes or someone to take initiative. I'll try it again and hope this was just an off night for them."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I like the build your own. This way I get all of the toppings I can never get and my kids can still get their classic pepperoni"}
{"text":"My family & I always come here to eat pizza. This is the only pizza my daughter will eat. There is this one guy(staff) that greets us,the customers, every time we come here, always asks how we're doing and always offer to take our tray away when done eating. Very friendly guy. His super friendly service is the reason why we come here all the time. Keep it up."}
{"text":"The pizzas are so good. The sevice was really good. The people are really nice. The pizzas are so flavorful. I promise you seven slices of pizza will make you full."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on Saturday afternoon, It wasn't busy at all, with my 3 teenage kids. Bekah was the first person to help us. We had never been here before and didn't understand how to order, she mumbled under her breath the entire time and acted as though it was a pain to explain the process. Even turned to one of her coworkers and said \"please take over for me\". Everyone else  was pleasant. Food was good."}
{"text":"It was really good. I love their gluten free pizza crust.  I will go there and order again."}
{"text":"My daughter's high school graduation was held on the ASU campus, and she wanted to do something casual afterward, so we headed to Blaze ... so glad we did. I love all of the fast casual pizza places like this (Mod, Fired Pie, etc.) but I think Blaze probably outdoes them all, especially on the variety of toppings (I'm already looking forward to going back and trying some different combinations). Everybody got to order their own pizza the way they wanted it, and everybody raved about how good it tasted. But what really set Blaze apart was the customer service ... seriously one of the best experiences I've ever had anywhere. From top to bottom, the staff was incredibly friendly, and especially accommodating with our large group and helping set things up so it was all ready when we arrived after the ceremony. Kyra and Nicole (and everyone else on staff, for that matter) went WAY above and beyond to make it a really cool celebration. Can't say enough good things about them!"}
{"text":"Fresh, made to order pizza. Unlimited toppings for one low price. Worth checking out if you're in the mood for something quick, casual and delicious :)"}
{"text":"3.5/5

Went here on a sunday evening just before the place filled up. It's an awkward sized restaurant since its on a corner so not great seating for large groups. There are a couple of tables for 6 though. When ordering its like a conveyor belt, similar to that of Chipotle, ending with a help-yourself drink station.

We ordered 2 personal sized pizzas, 1 entree salad, 1 pop, and 1 milk. The total came up to about $40. The food was good especially with unlimited toppings but I feel the price is a bit much for a family. If I were to come here with friends and each were paying for themselves then its a decent price for the quality. Otherwise, you'd get more bang for your buck with the typical pizza delivery joint."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza at a great price! Friendly service and fresh ingredients all around. Don't forget to add fresh basil! ;) The blood orange lemonade is something you oughta try as well!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing customer service. Food comes out very quickly and staff is on top of their game. Can't wait until cools down to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. After a long drive and battling traffic in downtown Toronto I was famished and all that I craved was a decent slice of pie. Blaze Fast did not disappoint. Truly I wasn't expecting this much, but the reviews were all great and apparently well deserved. It was not only that I was so hungry, but the fact that the pizza was just... Yum. The best way to describe the place is that it's like Subway, but with pizza. Pizza that tastes 100 times better than those terrible sandwiches. 

The crust, sauce, and toppings were perfection and the fact that it was done so quickly makes no sense, especially when it takes three times as long when you order delivery from a local place - and they NEVER taste this good! The atmosphere was fun, especially watching to see how people ordering in front of and behind you crafted their perfect pizza pies. The place isn't expensive at all, and the staff was great. I like that.
.
There's really not too much to say other than this: Blaze did not disappoint. Not one bit. And I'm hooked. Now will they please open a location closer to me?! I'd be there at least once a week. Okay twice. Promise."}
{"text":"It's a great place to get a nice filling meal. You get your own personal pizza that has 6slices. It's thin crust and wide variety of unlimited toppings is great too. They are fast and friendly when making your pizza and the prices are really good"}
{"text":"Good pizza, quick. A little awkward walking in to an empty restaurant with 15 employees lined up all echoing \"welcome to Blaze Pizza!\" But the room filled up a few minutes later so it wasn't so weird. 

Salad is expensive for the size it is."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out today for the first time today. Pizza is amazing, i got the red vine which was sooo yummy. They also offer a variety of unique beverages which is a plus. This will definitely be my new go-to pizza place!"}
{"text":"I love Blaze - the decoration and stuff is great. 
And the pizza is always bomb to me.

But the guest service isnt always good. It's a hit or miss. I always get barbecue for my sauce and every time I tell them that, I always sense a bad attitude. I'm not sure what the big deal is. Do you have to pre-prep your sauce or is it because you have to walk \"so far\" to the other end of the counter to get the bottle of bbq sauce? Regardless, it isn't a huge deal for a worker to get upset. 

At this location, I love going in and seeing this amazing guy named CHASE. He is always up beat, enthusiastic, smiling, and giving such a positive experience every single time I go in. I don't see him as much but when I do, it's nothing but much respect and positive vibes exchanged."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. This place is like the chipotle of pizza. The staff is so awesome and they call you by name, and there's a lot of them. The pizza tastes like GOD. Also, for what it is, its super cheap! Go. Eat it."}
{"text":"Cross contamination is real and scary in this place. They don't care that their hands (even with gloves on) are touching everything. They wipe the board and sweep with the same gloves. Then after talking with their friends, they make your pizza with the same gloves. One girl was even rubbing her arms and still prepared a ladies pizza. This was the worst experience I've had at Blaze."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite new pizza. Anytime you can make something specific to your liking it's always better. I do it like this. Regular sauce, mozzarella, gorgonzola cheese, pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms, pineapple, and red onion. If it sounds good try it you will not be disappointed. The gorgonzola is what makes it great in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wow I really love this place. I like the simplicity of the menu options. Just one blanket price for unlimited toppings, or a lower price for 1 topping or plain cheese. It comes out fast, crispy, and delicious. The portion is perfect for lunch & leftovers. And the staff is wonderful! They remember your name and they're all just super friendly. Definitely a nice (cheap) lunch spot downtown."}
{"text":"This is like the chipotle of pizza places. Build your pizza any way you like it, and it's fast, inexpensive, and delicious. The staff is so super friendly, which is always a plus. I will frequent this place often; like once or twice a week...its that good"}
{"text":"It's like subway, but for pizza. The toppings are reasonably high quality and there is a good variety. The crust is thin-ish and good. It is ready quickly and is delicious."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great pizza!
I really like the feeling of this place. it's hip and fun and it's set up very California style. not to mention its so inexpensive! 
the vegan / gluten free options are awesome. 
I definitely recommend coming here. 
& Brittney so sweet and funny and always makes it a great experience."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday for lunch. I have to say I'm a fan of build your own pizza as a vegetarian who wants more that the basic cheese and tomatoes offered by most places. They have a good variety of veggie topping. I say skip the pre-defined pizzas and make your own as you can then dictate the quantity and choice of toppings. If you stick with their choices, you will eat the whole pizza as the amount they put on is lacking, but if you make your own, you will have two meals. This seems pretty family friendly and my toddler was happy with the plain cheese. Please note this isn't a place where everyone in your party will receive their pizza at the same time, bubbling hot. Instead the are cooked individually and come out as they finish. For us it worked out well to order our child's pizza first and then the adults. This allowed the child's to cool before we served it to her. We will be back as this is a nice option where everyone gets what they want and it's pretty fast. I know others said they waited 5 min for their pizza as a negative, but come on, tell me where else can you get one so fast?"}
{"text":"Best pizza place! Crust is super thin, and I love that you can customize with unlimited toppings! Only took a few mins for it to be ready. Definitely worth the 12$
At the end of it I wanted to order another one haha and I'm not even a pizza fan."}
{"text":"I don't know how you could structure building your own pizzas any better than this. It's a shame major pizza places still haven't came close to an idea as this. Blaze is awesome you can't beat the prices and timing, I've been here now 3 times and loved it everytime with not one mistake problem or hassle . Last visit Sammie greeted us and she was very nice and did everything perfect when assisting with making the pizza. Great worker . Try them"}
{"text":"Pretty good I like that you can add as many toppings as you like for no extra charge. Customer service is good pizza taste great. The only thing is you have to add more than 2 toppings or else it will be a pretty dry pizza but I highly recommend this place you won't be disappointed. Pizza cost around 8 bucks."}
{"text":"This new place is in a good location in South End where you can find parking on the street. It is lower priced than similar create-your-own-pizzas where a just cheese pizza is $5 and 1 topping pizza is $6.50. I got the gluten free which was just ok, not great. The crust was simply too thin and like a cracker and there wasn't enough cheese on the pizza. 

I also got the little s'more's dessert. They put 1 assembled s'more in a little bag and warm it at the edge of the pizza oven. That was good in theory, but like the pizza it was 'just ok'. 

The staff were super nice. As I walked down the pizza assembly line, they all greeted me and were happy. 

I will go back and try Blaze again, but order the regular dough and not gluten free."}
{"text":"I called to order pick up, but they don't take phone orders, but told me I could order online with credit card which I did. I got two pizzas, red vine and link in. They assemble the pizza but don't actually put it in the oven until you give them your name once inside the establishment. I drove across town with the pizzas so heated them up on my pizza stone in my oven. The crust was amazing, cracker-thin just like I like it. I only ate the red vine one, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great pizza made just how I want it! No longer have to compromise on toppings to appease my kids finicky taste. Attentive and courteous staff who know their jobs and do them well. Kinda small and seating is always limited, but worth the roll of the dice if you want a fairly quick pizza fix without having to go to a chain pizza joint. If you have time and a few more dollars, I'd say go to Metro Pizza on Stephanie and Horizon Ridge, but I find myself stopping by Blaze more often and am completely satisfied everytime."}
{"text":"Tasty but I got a stomachache both times.  First time I had the regular pizza and got a stomachache.  Second time I tried the gluten-free pizza and got really bad stomach cramps for a long time after.  Must be some ingredient in the dough or sauce that I'm sensitive to. Too bad.

I can see why this concept would be popular on the west coast (Blaze is a chain from California)!  I love the build-your-own personal-size pizza with unlimited toppings idea.  It's excellent value for the price, and you can make the pizza as healthy or as weird as you like, because well, it's your own pizza and you don't have to share with anyone!

Ingredients are mostly fresh, and the sauces are tasty enough.  Like any pizza, if you get a lot of \"wet\" ingredients like mushrooms, tomato, etc., your pizza will probably be a little soggy.  That is to be expected.  So load up a good mix of ingredients and enjoy a nice cheap meal that may be delivered to you faster than ordering at McDonald's!"}
{"text":"I`ve wanted to try this for so long. Love how thin the crust is and the unlimited toppings. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Subway style pizza? Not really fan of the sauce always so I always ask for light sauce but somehow someway they always put more sauce than I'd like even when I explicitly say use less than half of what they tell you to use for \"light sauce\"
I was disappointed after the third time of this an decided not to go back, I only went there because it is fast but it remind me of the pizza they make at subway. Laughable......"}
{"text":"My family loves Blaze. It's a great addition to the neighborhood. It's fast and really good plus everyone can get their own specialty pizza made to their order. Very clean and the staff is well trained and friendly. The side salads are also very tasty and a nice addition."}
{"text":"Tasty. Fast.  Reasonable prices.  Love the toppings.  Lots of variety.  Drinks are pretty decent too."}
{"text":"Yet again, I'm back at Blaze. And as always, I have great food. The cheese is melted, its Sooo good! Build your own pizza or get a simple pie. You van get creative!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh pizza, had the veg out and added some pesto sauce! It is a great place to go for pizza specially since you can customize your pizza!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Blaze!! They are always fast and very nice when ordering. I am a out of town visitor but come to Las Vegas often, and when I come I try to go at least once. For only $8 you can get unlimited toppings it is really reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Love this place. Although the line was almost literally all the way around the restaurant, the line moved pretty quickly. For a very decent price (about $8), you can create your own pizza with a great variety of quality toppings and you get a 10-12\" pizza! Since the crust isn't super thick and bready, you don't fill up on dough and crust and get to enjoy your creation.
I think future locations need to seriously think larger seating capacity(!); and turn down the music a little. It was pretty loud tonight, I had to speak pretty loudly just to talk to the employees making my pizza.
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in today for lunch and we're pleasantly surprised. The decor is modern and fun and you have the option  of creating your own pizza.You can also select from menu choices of pizzas they have if you are not feeling  creative.Everything was fresh and you could taste the quality  in the ingredients  they use.Cant wait to go back! Prices are good and they also have a variety of salads too."}
{"text":"Gluten free option oh my!! And vegan cheese option!!! I was in heaven. Good pizza, good prices, fast service. My kids love the pizza and now I can too. Only thing missing is gluten free beer. We've gone twice in 4 days. Finally another good family option in town."}
{"text":"We had free coupons from their opening day and were out for an evening drive and decided to try it.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I tried the gluten free crust and hubby tried the regular crust.  He ordered a preset topping from their overhead menu board  called was the red vine with red sauce tomatoes basil special fresh mozzarella in balls pinched onto pizza and dribbled with olive oil. Was very good.  I had the gluten free crust for a change in my diet the classic red sauce which was really delicious!! I could eat a bowl of that sauce. .no kidding!  It's made Fresh everyday. .mozzarella and the special ball of mozzarella. . Fresh spinach chicken cubes mushrooms green pepper strips roasted garlic double pineapple. .i think that was it lol ..mine was delicious too. .the bottom was a little damp but they were very open to suggestions as the gluten free is such a different dough and if there's a lot of veggies like mine and pineapple that's a lot of moisture. . I suggested the pan with the small holes in it to keep baked pizza crust crispy and they were extremely pleasant about it all. Overall loved the fresh toppings and how healthy it all was. .yes we'll be going back for sure!  The only thing we had room for All tonight was the pizza.

  Five stars for the staff's genuine care that we enjoyed our meal :) and the quality of the ingredients!

p.s. i read someone had tummy troubles after but I am pretty sensitive and both of us are still fine. . Sorry the commenter had that issue. .could be from the coffee earlier in her day?  . .but I hope she tries it again at blaze. . A lot of lemonade could have that factor too if she had that as it's acidic ..cheers"}
{"text":"We had a cheese pizza for the kids - tasted great and was inexpensive! My friend and I shared the Artichoke pizza. It was good! We each had a small salad as well. They were a very good size and appropriately priced!  I am really looking forward to the white pizza next time.  
All staff and managers were VERY FRIENDLY. 
I was very happy to see a real lemonade option, since my son doesn't drink soda! 
I'm happy to live near and will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my second time in this restaurant. It feel like a pizza fast food to me. I ordered online so I didn't have to wait in line but it's always busy here. You have to wait in line to order what you want on your pizza and they'd put it on in front of you. Takes about 3-4 minutes to cook it. You then pick up your food and pick you table, inside or outside. It cost me about $18 for 2, 11 inches pizza. They taste awesome. Too bad there's no delivery."}
{"text":"Amazing food! It's fast & easy! Definitely my favorite pizza place to go to  they have such an incredibly nice staff. Thank you, Dan for an amazing hospitality!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. The pizza is delicious! Whenever I am craving pizza, it's the only place I go now. Everyone that works here is really nice. It doesn't take very long to get your food. The drinks are great too! I just really love everything about Blaze. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had 2 pizzas, both were excellent. The experience today was a bit intense because there were 13 employees. Almost all of which were behind the counter. 

The pizzas were ready in a matter of minutes.  Price of the pizzas were cheap, but the quality was outstanding.

We will be back to this place.  Just awesome!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Love that I get to choose toppings.  Served fast and hot.  Friendly staff and clean eating areas."}
{"text":"I had the green stripe pizza with white sauce. It was very yummy. But note, when they ask if u want sea salt, probably a better idea to decline - pizza was pretty salty as is. Very light crust so not over filling. Their value prop is being made over fire...I'm not sure I taste the difference between fire and oven or wood oven...but very good nonetheless."}
{"text":"What an amazing establishment. Great service and I couldn't believe the quality of the toppings. Great authentic pizza. Gluten free options. I have eaten there almost every two weeks since it opened. Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and varied responses from staff on celiac/gluten free. I definitely did not get toppings from underneath the counter as described by someone else. 

They do prepare your crust separately and the staff seem to have some level of education on being careful. You will get cross contamination from the toppings though. They are using the gloved hands in and out etc. Some of the sauces have a brush that would touch the pizza crust - so I purposely got the tomato with no brush. 

I think if you are not gluten free/not getting the gluten free crust this a great place. 

For gluten free - it's questionable for me. First the price - $4!! That's the most I've seen for a gluten free crust - and I've tried many GF pizza places (this isn't a service restaurant either - so it seems excessive). It's a small pizza too. I can't finish one, but suspect it's personal for many people. 

Secondly, the cross contamination is dependent on who you get. Some people are more careful than others. 

Last - the crust is too thin. Usually that would be a good thing, but the crust does not hold the toppings because it's just too thin. I have tried this with extra toppings (make your own) to a simple margherita pizza. The toppings just fall right off - even the sauce and cheese. They need to either add more dough to thicken it or add something to hold the pizza together. Again, have tried many GF pizza crusts and this was a disaster. You would need a knife and fork to eat or let it get cold (where it finally does hold). 

The toppings are fresh and the crust is good - just together you can't eat it like a pizza. 

For almost $18 for a small pizza - not worth it. Again, this is a self service place. 

I hope they build on their crust and potentially decrease the price. Even Pizza Nova does a better crust. 

This rating is based on gluten free only - I know many people who do enjoy the regular pizza. I think they need to fix the crust, price of GF and training on cross contamination if they are going to offer the GF crust."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, unlimited topping, quality toppings, finally you can get a sort of Italian pizza instead of the usual American, pepperoni should be banned in this place IMO they are for people who doesn't know a real pizza taste like, only thing complain the middle of the pizza is too soft, you can't pick it up and eat needs knife and fork until you hit near the crust."}
{"text":"Is there a such thing as healthy good tasting pizza??? And under $10!?!! 

Heck yes!!

Think of Blaze as Pizza meets Chipotle...pick from original or gluten-free dough...then the sky's the limit from there!! Pick white, red or spicy red sauce, choice of cheeses, choice of meats (or all the meats!!) excellent choice of veggies ( I recommend the roasted garlic and artichokes) then it gets quick fired in an oven in no time! 

Love that this con pet has finally come to fruition and that it's available here on the northwest side of Vegas. Stay tuned for updates because I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Since the first time we tried Blaze we love coming here. This location has been awesome as well. Beware the weekend lines get pretty long especially for dinner. 

One particular time they had 2 people call out and the staff was still doing an amazing job. I couldn't believe the teamwork I was seeing even under the tremendous pressure of hangry guests. I have been in the service industry for a long time and it was nice to see people like Eileen who kept there cool and still maintained a smile with every guest.

Megan has done a great job as well. I believe she is a manager. If not,  she should be. She definitely has things under control!

Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Spent 20 minutes looking for a parking Space during a festival nearby that had roads blocked off. Walked a few blocks in the heat and the they were out of gluten free dough. Cant eat regular. Maybe Next time...."}
{"text":"Absolutely, hands down best pizza I've had in a long time and even better service!!! You won't be disappointed! Prices are also great!!!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to this pizza place, all i can say is.. YUMMMMM!! the concept of building your own pizza is great. 
From the sauces to the fresh toppings, you cant beat it for a low price, and its unlimited toppings. And its baked in less than 3 minutes.. amazin'
The employees are great, they greet everyone as they walk in. 
Plenty of seating and good atmosphere. If they had TV's this would be a great place to eat pizza, have a beer, and watch some sports."}
{"text":"It's like a Pizza chipotle where you order a full pizza with whatever you want on it. They have gluten free dough and I saw vegan cheese. The salad said \"made fresh daily\" which I believe..but walking in at 6:30pm it looked like they had made it that morning and it was sitting there all day. The gluten free pizza was good..however, all made in same oven as regular crusts and is definitely contaminated with gluten so if you have a severe allergy, not a good place to go. We ordered a \"two portion\" salad and it was really small. Price wise it was decent considering it was a GF crust. About $15 for pizza + salad. Not quite the environment you'd want to dine out in unless you're a child or teenager..totally great place for kids!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good... BUT


Have to take a stab at the management. Jared. Seemed as though he was in charge. There seemed to me some miscommunication on customers and together/separate orders. Seemed like the manager Jared was a bit flustered. 
He yelled out in front of a line of guests \" Hey (name) you need to be more clear on these orders who's together and not because it's getting a bit ridiculous\" which when I say yelling out, I was in front of the register and it was LOUD. Unprofessional, and not very good management skills. You bring your employee in private to address issues  not blast them in front of everyone.(employees and customers) when I said \"thank u\" he replies \"Yep\". totally unprofessional And I'm completely turned off to come back because of him. The other employees were Great and friendly."}
{"text":"My new lunch place for sure. You get to make your own pizza with unlimited toppings for only $10.45. 

I have returned multiple times but I do have a warning for some customers. If you want something on your pizza and the staff tells you no, ask for the manager to confirm if it's for unsafe reason or is it only a recommendation. I asked to have pesto sauce in replacement of traditional tomato sauce and the staff said it's not recommended as it burns the dough when it's being cooked. I told them I am aware of it and insist to have pesto sauce like I have done for all my past visit to Blaze. The staff told me no it's can't do it. I was utterly confused and upset as I return to Blaze due to the option of putting anything I want on the pizza.. including what sauce base I want for my pizza. 

I spoke with the Manager after at the cashier and was told I am certainly allowed to use pesto sauce as a base sauce if I am okay with the burnt dough. Manager asked me for the staff that gave me the wrong information and spoke with her immediately. 

I appreciated the gesture and still enjoyed my non-pesto sauce pizza!"}
{"text":"WARNING VEGETARIANS:

The food is good and the employees mean well, I'm sure. But as a veg I don't know that I would feel comfortable going back. The first time I went I noticed that the guy who touched my cheese had just handled someone else's meat, so that was a little off putting. After giving them the benefit of the doubt I decided to go back. But this time the women not only touched the meat before touching my cheese but also dropped several pieces of bacon onto my pizza as she scattered it on another pizza. I had to ask someone to remove it because no one noticed or seemed aware of why that would be upsetting. Just feels like their isn't much consideration taken for people who don't want meat/meat residue on their food."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place.. Quite possibility the best pizza in Toronto......... And I would know.. I live in nyc ;)"}
{"text":"Sooo AWESOME. I loved my combination pizza (half white with pineapples, whitesauce, grilled oninons, red onions and bazil and half red sauce meatballs basil tomotoes grilled onions and red onions yummmmmyyy!!!!"}
{"text":"I think I found my new fave pizza it was so good.. I had a build your own.. they even have so many variety of sauces to put on the pizza.. love ittt"}
{"text":"Vegan Daiya cheese pizza, loaded with veggies.  Standard cooking time wasn't enough to melt the Daiya, so I had them put it back in the oven until the cheese was actually melted.  Just OK since it would have been better if any of the protein choices were vegan.  As well as whole wheat crust option.  Liked how they changed to fresh gloves after handling the animal based choices."}
{"text":"\"Blaze Pizza - Fast Fire'd\" I can tell you one thing, Blaze does live up to their slogan. If you haven't tried Blaze then you are missing out!

Blaze is located right besides Sunridge Mall with other eateries such as Samosa Grill, Buffalo Wild Wings, Five Guys, and Chuck E. Cheese in arms reach. There is plenty of parking and plenty of space to sit and eat. 

Blaze Pizza offers 3 types of pizzas, single topping for $7.45, specialty pizza for $10.45, and BYO (build your own) also for $10.45. For the speciality and BYO pizzas they included unlimited toppings and of course one choice of sauce. Each pizza comes as your standard thin crust size but you can have have a thicker crust for an extra $2 or gluten free crust for an extra $3. What I find different is that unlike your typical pizzeria which each individual pizzas are hand tossed, Blaze's pizzas are pressed. But the toppings though! With 7 choices of meats, 16 veggies, and 7 choices of cheese there are endless possibilities on what to get. I challenge you to go all out and have all the toppings in your thin crust pizza, double everything if you can handle it

Blaze not only offers pizzas but they do sell desserts and salads as well. 

Of course I would recommend Blaze to anyone who is in the search for the best pizza in Calgary and of course I will be back on a later date for another BYO edition."}
{"text":"Great food, Great service, Great Smiles. Wish there was more than 5 stars becuase they have eaned everyone and more. I love how friendly and helpfull all the staff is. Even checking on us throughout our meal. Food is also delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is so fab. The three ladies running the first half of the line, on the evening of 06/28, were outstandingly helpful with explaining how I can create something vegan and they were patient through all of my questions. Terrific service, and delicious food deserve a shout out."}
{"text":"Amazing price for the size of the pizza and amount of toppings. The dough is crisp and thin."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious!!! Our server was ok, I asked about their veggie offerings & he said a lot. I asked how much extra were the additional toppings. He didn't really answer me & said what else you want.  Then when I asked about their drizzles, he just said olive oil instead of providing all my options to put on my pizza.  I know olive oil was the one for my pizza but I had never been here before & like it when my server can take the time out & explain how things work. I mean most pizza places here don't have a pizza bar. Outside of that, my little veggie pizza was the most flavorful I've ever have & the blood orange lemonade was a treat!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Blaze Pizza!  We had only been to the one in Cambridge, MA, so we were excited to try a different location.  The pizza was definitely good, but I feel like the employees were pretty stingy with the ingredients.  From the sauce, to the cheese, to the toppings, we could have used a lot more of everything.  Still, everyone was nice and we had a good experience overall."}
{"text":"I did an online order for carry out.  The service was great.  A little strange going to the cashier in front of others in line.  I ordered an antipasto salad and a make your own pizza.   The salad was unremarkable.   It was very similar to a prepackaged one you get at the store.  The pizza was good.  Toppings were tasty.   The only problem is it was no longer hot when I got home.  I live 2 miles away and went right home. I chose to put the salad in the fridge and opened the pizza right away  The thin crust that makes it great to cook fast makes it bad to retain that heat.  Eat in, and eat fast.  Don't get the salad."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza here and the price is obviously unbeatable, but the service was just complete shit. I wanted everything on my pizza, and they were visibly not too happy about that (which was odd to me). At one point, I overheard the black dude with the patchy facial hair trying to quietly make an offhand joke (about messing with my food) with one of the other employees, in regards to me ordering everything. He didn't seem too pleased to work there, but I don't blame him. There's also the cashier kid who kept using \"bro\" after every sentence, like some meathead freshmen frat kid. Food is great, price is great, but you gotta be WAY MORE SELECTIVE on the kids you hire here"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Henderson!! Great food and excellent service!!! Thanks you Messiah for your great customer service!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a thin crust person but I had no problem killing my whole pie the spicy sauce is amazing and the toppings are fabulous especially the roasted garlic and all for a great price.Loved the blood orange lemonade you gotta try it. I went two days in a row it was so good!!!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza and service I have ever experienced. The employees are rude, yell to each other, slam things on purpose, and one of them told me to get off my phone. The same person also asked another person when he is moving back to his own country."}
{"text":"LOVE the BYOB option and that they have vegan cheese without any extra charges! I like the natural soda and water options as well. Great for kids!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza...perfect cookfed and a lot of flavor....nice guys...keep pounding !!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying blaze and it was beyond my expectations, thanks to Logan for his recommendation on trying the art lover pizza it was amazing!  He was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"This place was so exciting. It is subway for your pizza!!!!! The food as amazing and delightful. Every taste made me want to eat more. 5 stars to this place for sure! Staff were nice too."}
{"text":"This place is BOM dot com!! Probably the best pizza I've ever had !! It's like subway but for pizza !! I can't wait to go back & I hope they don't disappoint me because I'm easily disappointed!!"}
{"text":"my husband and I have been there twice now and have been happy both times. their gluten free pizza is delicious and reasonably priced. it would be nicer if it was a little bigger and seating was a little more comfortable. Other than that the food and service is great!"}
{"text":"With all my friends recommending this place to me I have to say it was a great experience. They work to get your food going fast, but the quality is really good.

They have a pretty friendly staff and the prices compared to other pizzerias are good. Will be back here again in the near future."}
{"text":"My wife received a gift card as a part of her tip from one of the owners. So this was our first time eating here. We loved it!  Had a simple veggie half and meat pizza. We also got the large chicken salad and it was perfect for two people.  Thanks and we'll be back soon!"}

{"text":"It's the Moe's of pizza places. Build you own pizza from 38 toppings.  They have several crusts to choose from including gluten free($3 more). A build your own pizza is $7.85 for unlimited toppings.  There is only one size pizza.  Big enough to split of your not really hungry.  They have outside seating too.  The pizza is fantastic, and they have s'more cookies for dessert."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the BEST pizza places I've eating at...I loved the build your pizza and it was ready in 10 minutes and the Customer Service was awesome she explained everything to me and was super nice ... I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Build your own pizza is the best idea, especially when the pizza is a fixed price for as many toppings as you want . The pizza has a thin crust and a touch of sauce . It is absolutely delicious !"}
{"text":"I don't give out a ton of 5-star reviews, but I LOVE Blaze Pizza!  Huge variety of tasty toppings, really nice thin crust, quick friendly service, comfortable and clean seating area -- and all for a VERY reasonable price.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Even the font on the menu boards looks like Chipotle.  

Quick, choose your own, whatever toppings you want, and for pretty cheap, just under 8$.  They make it in front of you, and bake it in under 5 minutes.  It's a super thin crust because of this, but it's a good crust.

Can't beat the price, though it's just a bit big for one person, and too small for two. 

Nice to have a cheaper pizza option in town vs the 30$ pies that most places seem to have."}
{"text":"If you have not been here - you must go!  It's the Chipotle of pizza, only better than you've imagined.  For a set amount, you can add as many different as toppings you want. I highly recommend the high-rise crust, even though it's an add on - totally worth it.  I am on the smaller side, but one of these pizzas is certainly 2 meals.  The staff is full of fun personality, if you talk to them.  Great addition to South End."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. Everyone gets their own pizza. The gluten free dough is really good. The toppings are awesome. I typically don't like pizza but I love the customs pizzas from here."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience and will never return. I ordered online and received my pizzas after people walking in after I arrived. The pizzas came out over about 30 minutes so the first was cold before I even left. Total chaos. I will never return. The pizza isn't good when old. Good luck if you ever go."}
{"text":"I'm kicking myself for not trying this place sooner.  I've been twice, the first time just getting a cheese pizza and the second time getting several toppings.  I was pleased both times.  The crust, sauce and cheese are flavorful.  The toppings are fresh and generous portions.  It's kind of like Chipotle for pizza.  They've got an insane amount of variety in the toppings.  And it's cooked after they make it for you and it only takes about 5 minutes.

The cheese pizza was only $5.25 for an 11\" pie.  That's pretty good.  I got that and a soda for less than $8.00.  That's a great deal for the quality of the food.  I expect to make this place a regular stop in my dining-out routine."}
{"text":"Pretty quick and good.  Staff was friendly and courteous.  Store just opened so time will tell as far as customer service and quality of pizzas go.  Nice thin crust with just the right amount of toppings.  Not overloaded with just a bunch of stuff just to make it bigger.  Time from pizza creation to table was about 15 min.  We got 2 pizzas and 2 reg drinks and paid ~$21.  Not too bad for getting something pretty good quickly and not feeling bloated and stuffed when you are done.  I will definitely recommend to others and will return."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service, great toppings. Finally ordered a pizza with all the toppings. So good! Need a location close to my work or home..."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Blaze because I knew my husband had been wanting to try it. In the Air Force, well on the flight line in any case, they are always talking about food, lol. I was not in the mood for pizza at all but I didn't let him know that. 

Well, I was pleasantly surprised!! The line went fast, there were plenty of FaNtAsTiC topping choices. Not just your typical toppings but a wide variety, several sauces, multiple cheeses to choose from, plenty of veggies, even a salad pizza! 

They have specialty pizzas you can order as well but to me for the price of build your own, I'd build my own every time I go! It's very affordable, we got a pizza each but if we could agree on the sauce, lol, we could get one pizza and it would have only been about $12 for 2 adults. But it was $22 for 2 pizzas and 2 drinks and we ended up bringing a whole pizza home, half of each of our own pizzas, so we had lunch for Sunday!  To me, that's a pretty good deal. 

The atmosphere was nice and despite being there near closing I never felt rushed or hassled by the employees. Props! I can't tell you how many times that has happened at other places and it's so rude. EVERY employee I dealt with this Saturday night was kind and courteous at Blaze! ? 

Overall it was a GrEaT experience, FaNtAsTiC food,  and over the top customer service? 

We've definitely found our new pizza place, no more delivery here!"}
{"text":"Not only is this the best pizza in charlotte, but the service is great. Super fast. KB is the best - she remembers us and makes sure that we're taken care of."}
{"text":"Updated from my last review: the owner saw that I was unhappy with my experience and sent me a coupon to try the pizza again on the house. So I went and grabbed the pizzas with high hopes. I was not disappointed. The pizza was seriously delicious and way way way different than the first time I had it. I will likely return again this week. Maybe the first time I went was just an off day or something. But this time the pizza was seriously amazing. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times enjoyed my meal. The pizzas are made to order individual ones. You choose your sauce and toppings,  which is nice. Both times my pizza was well made and delicious. My family also enjoyed their pizzas. It is a good value too."}
{"text":"This is by far the best thin crust pizza I've ever had! Ordered one with spicy marinara, pepperoni, mozzarella, mushrooms and black olives (delish!). The other was regular marinara with mozzarella, mushrooms, black olives and green peppers (yum!) Easily the best pizza for the best price. The service was awesome, the staff was friendly, and there was more seating than expected. Blaze's entrance is just a bit past the #10 Dundas building entrance (if coming from Yonge)."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here after receiving the BOGO coupon in the mail. I was hesitant based off of some of the reviews, but Blaze definitely met or went above or expectations! Both our pizzas were cooked perfectly, staff was informative and helpful, and service was quick! We eat a lot of pizza at multiple places, and we will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"For the price, it's hard to beat Blaze's unlimited toppings and thin fired pizzas. Although it's a chain, it's new to Calgary so I wasn't sure quite what to expect. The toppings were definitely a cut or two above your typical unlimited toppings joints, with very tasty meatballs, fresh ricotta, artichoke hearts and more amongst the many options (all of which have calorie counts, but let's not kid ourselves).  I also liked that I could mix the cream and tomato base sauces to get the best of both worlds.  Putting the toppings together took about 3 minutes, then the pie was diligently fired (gas not wood, it's the only knock against it) by the staff.  As I loaded mine quite heavily it took about 6-7 minutes to cook, including a bit of blackening of the edges done meticulously by the oven's wall. One thing to note is that when it comes out of the oven they call your number and try to hand it to you, but don't forget that you can put finishers on it...I opted for the arugula and basil pesto. All in all, a really tasty pizza with quality toppings that's good for 1.5 people for about $13 all in makes this a 5 star option."}
{"text":"Have recommend this place to several friends as the toppings are fresh and the staff is very friendly and more than willing to help you creat your perfect pizza.  This is a great place for a quick bite to eat and has become a regular lunch spot for me on the weekends"}
{"text":"The service was slow. The sauce was too acidic and the food did not sit well. I would definitely prefer to take my business across the street."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Blaze Pizza! It's conveniently located right at Yonge and Dundas and will definitely satisfy your pizza craving.

I first discovered this place during their grand opening special. Their promotion was a FREE full-sized pizza with UNLIMITED toppings. How could you possibly resist?!

A full-sized,, custom pizza is $10.45 which is an absolute steal. 

My pizza: mozzarella, parmesan, grilled chicken, Italian sausage, pepperoni, black olives, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, oregano, spinach, and arugula.

Will definitely be coming back for more :)

Atmosphere: 5/5 | Service: 4/5 | Price: 5/5"}
{"text":"KB, the manager, was fabulous! Personable and genuinely cared that we were having a good time. My family and I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I just bought 4 pizzas for guests that were over and gluten free. We were super excited but was a big disappointment. While waiting for out pizza it was put on the counter for 5 mins while they called out some girls name...only to find out it was mistaken and one of my pizzas while all these people lined up hovered over it...then the boxed it. Overlooked it and brought it home. Pizza tasted great. 2 of my 3 guests had hair in their pizza...like bit into and stringy like cheese from mouth to pie. So so gross. I'm so disappointed and embarrassed. We couldn't even finish them."}
{"text":"Great service and food, a chipotle style pizza chain but all of the many ingredients are fresh! Now I see why Labron James invested into this company! It's a hit! Try the customize pizzas and enjoy the tasty food!"}
{"text":"I went to Blaze on Wednesday night. The food was great and especially the service. One of the workers John came to my table and picked up my trash. He was super kind to me and my friends!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Tons of ingredients, better than Fired Pie! Clean restaurant and friendly staff. GLUTEN FREE crust available and it's yummy!!! A+++"}
{"text":"GLUTEN FREE dough!! Amazing fresh ingredients!! Yummy teas! If you've never been here, it's like a subway for pizza! You must come try it and they have an awesome app where you can order ahead of time and earn rewards"}
{"text":"What a treat! Nice fresh veggies, you build your own or get one of theirs. Either way great value,crispy crust and a nice size. Much better than the bigger chains. Nice decor and outside seating when weather gets cooler."}
{"text":"Tried this place on Sunday. Love the Build Your Own pizza feature. The thin crust pizza is baked in front of you for about 3 minutes. It is a good experience. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty quick on my meat eaters with bacon, friendly too!  And there's plenty of seating. I'll definitely be coming here before or after going to the range to shoot"}
{"text":"What an experience eating pizza.... I was going to walk out as the line to just order was very long.  Oh to my surprise this has to be the best pizza I have ever had and the experience of how fast and pleasant all 25 workers are.  Thank you Jesus. Build one of these in Reno right now"}
{"text":"Excellent service!  I was quite impressed with the young men working so fast but also seeming to enjoy their job!  The restaurant itself reminded me of Chipotle.  Go down the line and choose your toppings, wait a few, and get out.  If you dine in, take out boxes are available by the drink station for left overs.  Gluten free crust available, and they offer to change their gloves :).  I love this place."}
{"text":"My new favourite pizza place in TO.  Visited the Yonge and Dundas store which I think is their first location in Canada.  Simply awesome pizzas with a super thin crispy crust that are totally delish!!  The menu has a variety of signature pizzas, a simple cheese and sauce pizza, or you can build your own.  We built our own with all the toppings.  It was a bit wet near the middle but I loved it.  The ingredients are fresh and the price reasonable.  They also have an app for ordering and can track your purchases for rewards ie. free pizzas!  Have already gone back several times.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Perfect! I have been here two times and will be back again. Customer service was a 10 staff is active and keeps busy inside and out place is perfect for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm not rating 5 stars is because they aren't fully halal yet, only meatballs which taste ok if you want those on a pizza. Everything else is absolutely fantastic. If you're around Ryerson make sure you try this place, only 10$ for all the topics you want makes this joint an affordable option for us indebted students :P"}
{"text":"It's one of the slowest blaze pizza we've been to.....it took us over 25 minutes just to order our pizzas even though there are only 5 parties ahead of us.  Workers here super slow. We will never return back to this location again.  If you want a quick service go to the blaze pizza on Bell Rd and 12st.  They are really quick and friendly there."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The service is fast and friendly, and the pizzas are awesome!  There are so many choices, so there's something for everyone.  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Schnelles und sehr gute frische Pizza. Für $8.95 kann man so viel Belag wie man möchte ordern. Einfach Klasse!! Wir waren bereits 3 mal dort und werden wieder hingehen
Fehlt definitiv in Deutschland."}
{"text":"It was Sunday evening when my family and friends decided to try this place out. It was our very first time experiencing the fast, custom, chipotle - style pizzeria. I must say that my family and I were very impressed. 

We arranged the tables in the patio to accomodate our large party. We were not able to fit inside because seating was limited for larger parties. The inside was not as large as I hoped. However, the patio was able to accommodate us easily. We had 15 people with us. Thankfully it was a beautiful evening. 

Although the line was long, we undestood that patience was required for custom deliciousness. We are a family of five,one is a baby, so we ordered four pizzas. 

First you pick your crust: you can get the thin crust, a double crust (which is two crusts made into one), or a gluten free crust. Then you pick the sauce, I opted for the classic red with garlic pesto. Next is the cheeses, I added mozzarella and fresh olavine mozzarella. Finally the toppings. They have almost any topping you can imagine. The best part is that it is all included in the price, which means that you can add as little or as many topping as you like. Want to double up on meat? No problem, just let them know you want more! I also added fresh arugula on top of my finshed, fast-fired pizza. By the time I paid and got my beverage from the self serve beverage station, the pizzas were ready to pick up. 

My husband, the kids, and myself devoured our pizzas! I loved the thin crust and the fresh ingredients. The crust surpisingly can hold up to the toppings. What is even better is that it was completely tailored to each of our tastes because we designed our own pizzas. There was nothing left to take home, not even the crust!

I'm even thinking about going back again this week. For our family to have dinner for under $40 and be completely satisfied is a rare occasion. We will definitely be coming back again, again and again.

I'd also like to note the BLOOD ORANGE LEMONADE was a family favorite! Yum."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place...but 3/3 times I've eaten here, I had terrible diarrah within 2-8 hours afterwards. Perhaps its my stomach but better watch that ovalinin cheese. 

Other than that great concept. Price is on the higher end for a pizza that doesn't fill me up. After making your pizza you will have to stand around for 3 minutes twiddling your thumbs until its ready. Seatig space is limited but for the most part goes well with the brand."}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is amazing.  They have wonderful options for both vegetarians and meat eaters.  I have visited Blaze many times and like to think of myself as a usual.  Tink who works there is a phenomenal staff member there.  She always has a smile on her face, remembers what I like, and makes a mean pizza.  The ingredients they put on the pizza are always fresh.  They have an app where you can earn \"flames\" for going on a regular basis and earn a free pizza."}
{"text":"Went to blaze in the States and loved it. I got so excited when I heard you came to Calgary. Went in with high expectations and you guys didn't disappoint from the friendly staff who address you by name to the incredible pizza I will be back. The only thing is I was hoping to put spinach on my pizza but you guys didn't have any. Overall excellent experience see you guys soon"}
{"text":"I've always preferred thin crust pizza over medium/thick crusts.  The thinner the better - where possible when made in-house, I request \"cracker thin\" for my pizza crust.  So clearly Blaze's crust is right up my alley.

I love the concept of choosing your own UNLIMITED toppings.  But my recent visit coincided with calories being listed on menus / signs, so it's hard to go all out!   But I still created a delish pizza - with applewood bacon, ground beef, mushrooms, pineapple, caramelized onions.  Service is super friendly...and patient too!  

With its location at Yonge/Dundas, it's a perfect place to visit before a movie.  I'd rather fill up on Blaze pizza than movie popcorn!"}
{"text":"Went in with my grandson, with a received coupon.  Could not believe the line and crowd for the lunch hour.  This Pizza shop is a highly mechanized production line offering whatever topping you wish. After eating our bbq chicken topped pie, I now know why there was such a crowd.  The pizza featured is a thin crust for you calorie counters with delicious toppings.  My grandson, 7, who is an extremely picky eater, was ecstatic and devoured most of the pie.  I will return to this business, as I believe it has the best tasting pizza in town."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Asked for my pizza a little well done and got it burnt. Guess ill just put it in my own oven to dry it out a bit next time... thats if I go back."}
{"text":"This place is a chain? Well gimmie some more chain food!

Place is a bit pricey (about $10.50 for a pizza) but given the location its a welcome addition to the food options at Yonge and Dundas.

Build your own pizza is great! But beware you risk adding too many toppings and soggying the delicious crust that they make.

I tried the BBQ chicken pizza and my yelpmate had a build your own. I did not love the bbq chicken toppings so I enjoyed my yelpmates bespoke pizza more than mine. 

That may just be a matter of personal preference for taste but the crust was amazing on both.

Give it a shot! especially great before catching a movie upstairs."}
{"text":"Love this place! The only place that has all the ingredients I need to make the perfect pizza!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that U can order your pizza with whatever you want. I always tend to go Veggie style and get the Balsamic glaze on it afterwards. It's very good and I haven't had a bad experience at this Blaze. They need to add the tipping function to their POS system though, not everyone carries cold cash."}
{"text":"awesome quality for such a reasonable price. veggies are fresh and you can add unlimited amount of toppings. bonus: they can make half and half pizzas which is great for sharing or trying two different things. 

a family favorite - we will be back."}
{"text":"I am here to comment on customer service. 
We (Dad and two daughters (one just started RU and one graduated from same last year)) were at Blaze on April 4/16 around 5:30pm.
I was there early and  had my cell charging at the only available outlet near the washrooms. 
I noticed one male service person (Mr. X) was having a friendly chat to a customer because Blaze wasn't that busy yet. After I also asked him a menu related question and he handled it very well. 
When my girls showed up, Mr. X dashed out from his ordering station and told me better not leaving the phone there out of concern that it maybe stolen. 
I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza because it is a signature dish and not customized. But when I got my pizza it had real problem because the coverage was not even and with very little ingredients like chicken and Gorgonzola cheese. I stood up and went to Mr. X and showed him the pizza. Without any hesitation he offered to make me a new one as it was very difficult to correct the mistake. Later, when the new pizza was ready Mr. X even offered me a free drink. 
I am veteran of the hospitality industry and recently sold my pizza restaurant to my ex chef who later reopened it as Via Merchanti Pizza. 
At the end, we all walked out very happy customers. Usually Quick Service restaurants don't behave like this and Mr. X came to the rescue and saved the day. Five stars to him and Blaze of hiring the right people."}
{"text":"The service was great. The pizza was average if you are looking for thin crust this is your kind of restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. I saw an Instagram post from blogto and was so happy to know it was close by my work. Fun fact Blaze has been endorsed by LeBron James. 

I got the art lover pizza for $11 after tax and I throughly enjoyed my pizza. Its mozzarella cheese, artichoke, ricotta and sauce on top. Their selling point is that they have rapid fire oven nd cooks the thin crust pizza in 180 seconds. I didn't time it but I'm sure it was.
 
The Art Lover pizza was saucy and creamy, I would definitely go back. If I do, I want to try a custom made pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza that's fast! Cool that you can choose so many ways to make your own pizza. Only complaint would be that with football season coming up there's no tv's there. Would be a great place to have pizza, beer and watch the game! Hopefully that'll change!"}
{"text":"the sweetest crew!! They are all so happy and kind, making sure we had everything we needed! LOVE THIS LOCATION!!!"}
{"text":"My meat eater pizza was delicious.  Fast service. Manager Andrew was extremely friendly and helpful.  Would definitely visit again. A+"}
{"text":"I got a make your own for 7.95. I piled it high with all the veggies and choose the spicy red sauce. I didn't have to add the red flakes afterwards because the sauce was enough plus the banana peppers I added. They have vegan cheese for an additional $3. The crust is thin, so you don't feel overly full if you eat the entire personal pizza. It could have use an extra minute in the fire, since a very small part was doughy but overall good tasting. Sat on the patio which is nice to escape the crowds inside. An employee came by later and picked up our trays and trash. Very good service from ordering until we left."}
{"text":"Its okay, service was good but cashier was kinda dumb.  She kept trying to charge me extra for a customized pizza because i asked for a signature pizza but with one topping LEFT OUT.  Then she had no idea why i handed her 20.25 (to get a $5 back) and i explained it to her 4 times and she kept shaking her head and handing me back the quarter. I guess Lebron dont like change. Pizza was okay but somewhat bland.  Guys at the oven station were great.  Very efficient and polite."}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza I've had in the 3 years of being gf! The crust actually tasted normal and I had no stomach troubles afterwards at all! Also great customer service, I had dropped my pizza from holding too much when walking down the stairs. They helped me clean it up and made me a new pizza for free. It was busy on Sunday at lunch, but very worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing....that's all have to say about Blaze. There is nothing better than fast, delicious, and customized pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped in one night before walking over to Sycamore along the rail trail. They had handed out free coupons a few weeks prior to promote their opening, so I had to try it out. 

I understood the concept of the \"mod\" pizza after frequenting Zablong which is close to my office in uptown. I built my own pizza with no trouble, then waited less than 5 minutes. I noticed immediately that the prices for a standard, no-frills pizza are lower than Zablong. I had a coupon for a free pizza, but I believe it would've only been $6.99. 

The pizza was definitely smaller, but the thin crust was kind of charred. Definitely a serving size for only one person. I think you can pay more for a thicker crust. It was nothing special, only a place to fix a quick pizza craving. I choose Zablong over Blaze."}
{"text":"I've been to several of these new Fast Casual Pizza places, and several Blaze as well. This particular Blaze is a really cool restaurant, the pizza is great as expected and the staff very friendly. I'd definitely recommend. I had the build your own pizza with pepperoni, sausage, onion and roasted red pepper. Yum yum."}
{"text":"I actually wanted to like this place. Let's start with what I didn't like....
I didn't like how incredibly thin the pizza was. I didn't like the already made salads that were very overpriced and quite small and flavorless.  I didn't like how when trying to ask for toppings to be placed on my veggie pizza the girl kept asking after each and every topping, \"are you done?\" And that question began after topping #2! I didn't like how they offer only ONE size pizza and NO option for even a smaller size for kids. That means share a one topping pizza with my picky 9 year old or get more pizza then we really need. I chose to go for more pizza thinking leftover pizza would be welcome later. Well, to my surprise, that thin pizza doesn't really fill you at all so my 9 year old ate her entire pizza in one sitting. My husband and I shared a pizza and I had two very small slices and the above mentioned flavorless salad. Total cost of meal....just shy of $30.
The one thing I liked....
My pizza didn't come out burnt to a crisp! Trust me, I saw two other pizzas that didn't fair so well!"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza at a great price. The ingredients are simple and for a few buck more you can have a gluten free crust or a thick crust pizza aka normal pizza. Their standard pizzas are thin crust.  Online ordering is easy to work but make sure you read the part that says they won't put your pizza in the oven until you get there, which is a plus imo. There's unlimited toppings without raising the price so if you feel their pizzas won't fill you up then pour on the toppings. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The crust is perfect and the staff work hard to make your pizza just the way you like it.  The toppings always look fresh.  The staff are welcoming and friendly. I am addicted to this place.  It's my new \"go to\" lunch place."}
{"text":"Super rude customer service!  First of all I asked the guy prepping my pizza to put a pesto sauce and he heard balsamic and when I saw him using that I was like oh no!I asked for pesto, he was gracious enough to change it, all of a sudden the manager took over my pizza from that point and she literally snapped at me when I was getting a vegan pizza and asked her to not put her hands on the counter while prepping my pizza as I have allergies and there was meat all over the counter. She continued to snap at me  and was super rude while I was talking to the cashier about the incidence. 
If you're someone with allergies not the place for you! Clearly they need better management!!!"}
{"text":"This is my usual dinner place on a Friday night! Its unusal that I come here on a weekday: its my weekend snack. I actually really like the concept, I think it's a great idea to build your own pizza. I always get a high rise but this time, I decided to get their signature thin crust. The service is very fast and pleasing. The people that helped me out today were Emily who is always so nice! She always asks me how my day is and makes my pizzas perfectly. Nadia also helped me! She was so friendly! The other staff members Angel and Naffissa were so engaged and seemed happy about helping me and my friends out! Jake was eager to help me with the menu when I couldnt decide by giving me tips on his favorite and the most popular pizzas! The staff is great, the restaurant is clean, and overall the service is fast! The manager that was on duty tonight deserves a raise! I thanked Naffissa for her hospitality and tipped generously! The only complaint that I have is that it was a tad bit hot in the restaurant but nothing I couldnt handle. See you next Friday Blaze!"}
{"text":"Chipotle of pizza places. Extremely good, fast, and cheap. My family loves it here! Con: dinner time can be extremely packed with long wait times. Overall worth it."}
{"text":"The pizza is great- we keep coming back! The service is fantastic and KB is so helpful and sweet. Best pizza we've found in Charlotte. :)"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner at 8:30pm, staff was already closing the entire restaurant putting away food items, cleaning, stools flipped upside down on tables, etc. mind you the hours of operation state the establishment is open until 10pm. 

When I went to pick up one of the finished pizzas the girl asked if I would be taking this to go or dining in. When I replied dining in, she very rudely rolled her eyes. When my husband picked up the other pizza a few minutes later, the majority of the staff were mocking his name. Both of these staff actions made us feel extremely uncomfortable and uninvited.

Also, thought it was funny since 10 other customers came in between the time of 8:30pm-9:00pm and some even walked out without pizza because of the unprofessional staff. Sad and disappointed because we frequent this restaurant quite often."}
{"text":"This has to be my new favorite Pizza Restaurant!  Subway and Porta Subs for Sandwiches, Chipotle and Zabbas for Mexican food and BLAZE for Pizza.  You can have any topping you want for only $7.65. They only have one size which is 11 inches, perfect size for one person AND IT TASTES GREAT!!!!  They put the toppings on right in front of you all you want and their fire oven cooks it in less then 3 minutes AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"They have really good pizza. However the staff is mostly teenagers who lack professionalism. They were laughing at a lady that was behind me in line while I was waiting for my pizza. I'll be back for the pizza but the service definitely needs some work."}
{"text":"So.. There are a few different places like this around now... Food is good at both.. What sets this spot above all? Ethan.. Yea.. Ethan... This guys passion and customer service is beyond what I've gotten at 4 and 5 star dining establishments.. It shows every time a guest hits the door.. To the time a pizza comes out.. To the time I left.. I just witnessed him help a little girl, who was probably 5 years Old, to her table with the pizza.. The little girl just said thank you and his entire face lit up. Just by a thank you! He keeps busy... His attention to detail is great as well! I've come here once before and the service was OK at best.. Today's visit, however, will be the reason I come back on a weekly basis.. 

Blaze you gotta good young man working for you! An asset to your company for sure!"}
{"text":"I came here for the vegan pizza...it is so amazing!!! The service was also great. We came at a busy time but the wait wasn't  long. They are quick and efficient."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza spot!! The white top pizza is amazing!  I add chicken to mine to make it even tastier! The blood orange lemonade really hits the spot on a hot Vegas summer day. Can't wait to try a new creation of my own from the build your own menu!!"}
{"text":"The staff is extremely friendly , upbeat environment gets the place going with good vibes, told them it was my first time here and very detailed and willingly explained to me and my boyfriend how it works. The food tasted very fresh and was very fast , their blood orange lemonade is AMAZEBALLS!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, good prices, nice staff, fast service, the pizza is very thin crust they have every option available as far as toppings all for the same price and it is typically served in less than 5 minutes. Well not the best pizza I've had it is certainly a fast and a decent option."}
{"text":"I tried ordering online and it keeps saying email not valid. I tried calling and the lady who answered the phone said they don't take phone orders. I guess we won't be trying this pizza. I would have gone but my special needs client can't handle being out too long."}
{"text":"Love this place! Went here for the first time today, and was so happy with how quickly I was able to decide what I wanted on my pizza. I just love the idea of making your own pizza and the drink selection with agua frescas was a nice addition!"}
{"text":"If you offer lactose intolerant friendly food, your employees should be conscious about changing gloves and cross comination. Plain and simple. At this Blaze on Eastern, employees looked at me as if I was making their work shift harder because I asked them to change gloves and was specific about not letting cow's milk cheese on my pizza. I shouldn't have to feel awkward while eating out. Also, what looked like the manager was just standing around and gossiping with other employees.(female with glasses)  Not paying attention to customers and orders. 
Personally, I am an assistant manager of a high traffic fast food restaurant in a mall and from the line staff to the cashier to the pizza slicer to the manager, I feel like this place needs some serious help. 
The best part of the experience was the kid that was cleaning tables. Very courteous and professional."}
{"text":"This place is beyond a treat. I can't stop thanking my friend who introduced me to this place. The food is absolutely amazing yet , more importantly to me , the customer service is A+++++. There are many restaurants that I don't visit because of the employees attitudes even though the food is good. But this place has it all. Just go there once and you'll end up becoming a regular"}
{"text":"Their pizza sauce is delicious. Their drinks are all natural made with real cane sugar. We got a rising crust spinach mushroom roasted garlic pineapples and chicken cherry tomatoes. The employees were very attentive and all seem very happy."}
{"text":"Pizza was soggy. Service was horrible. There were no utensils. When I asked for some, they refused to provide any. I asked to speak to the manager and he was a total jerk. Very dissappointed."}
{"text":"Although 3 stars, we actually enjoy this restaurant.  They do a really good job with what is essentially fast food pizza.  But, it is truly prepared to order.  

As for the stars, I can't give 5 stars for this style pizza restaurant any more than I could give 5 stars for a \"go down the line\" sandwich shop.  So, for me, 4 stars is the starting point.  From there I deducted 1 star because some of their staff are very sloppy, dripping one sauce into the container for another, dropping one cheese into the container for another, same thing with other ingredients.  So, a person could get a bit of something they didn't want.

We have also eaten at Pizza Rev, very similar.  We like both, but prefer the pizza at Blaze (though we do prefer the soft drink dispenser at Pizza Rev, with its many varieties)."}
{"text":"I came here with some buddies and I swear we will never come here again due to the shitty service. 
There was a kid with blond hair that was especially rude. He had such a bad attitude and his customer service was shitty. 
I ordered vegan cheese pizzas and the blond dude seemed super irritated that he had to change his gloves. He had an irritated facial expression that made him look unapproachable. While another guy asked what I wanted as toppings on one of the pizzas that I orders & while I'm telling him what I wanted- this kid with the blond hair kept interrupting me with the same questions that I had already answered several times. He seemed like those children who interrupt two grown ups while talking because they don't understand what manners are yet. I must have told him about 4 times that I wanted vegan cheese on my pizzas. 
That kid with the blond hair needs to get fired and he needs to go back to the first grade to learn about respect and manners. 
I'll never come here again nor will I ever refer anyone here."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The only reason I give it a 1 star is food handling, please make sure to watch the employees who handle your food hands. The reason I state this is you'll want make sure they aren't touching their faces, hair etc then touching your food. I witnessed someone stretching their head then touching the tray which the pizza was placed on."}
{"text":"Good pizza , fast and good service. It can get very busy sometimes. The pizza is thin crust and very good. You can customize it to ur liking and add different toppings. Cost about 10$ for a pizza that will up about 1 or 2 max."}
{"text":"Pizza is good  but they have the worst frequent award program.  Bought eight build your own pizzas but you only get rewarded for one Flame....that is lame!  Might as well not have the program at all.  All the workers agree how lame it is."}
{"text":"Blaze  Was very good , very quick service, And outstanding pizza.  Only fault I would give it .... plastic silverware"}
{"text":"Came here on Pi Day (3/14/16) and it was SUPER busy.  Despite this, the staff was super nice and efficient.  I thought it was amazing how you can make the pizza of your dreams for a pretty cheap price and have it made super quick (like 180 seconds quick).  Will be back here again when I'm jonesin' for a good slice!"}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place a while back, and I finally got around to visiting. A cute atmosphere in a central location just at Yonge and Dundas. I appreciate the gluten free & vegan cheese options for no extra charge for those of us who can't have dairy products. I ordered the \"green stripe\" pizza with the vegan cheese. It was as delicious as it sounded and being a pesto lover, it made the pizza just perfect. 

I will definitely be back to try the build your own pizza, as I see it's a well-loved option. All in all, a great experience and a great place. Great location, too."}
{"text":"Been here several times and always had great pizza. Yesterday's pizza was the best!! Dippy and Tink (alias pizza-maker names) prepared and fired my pie and it was perfect!
Lots of toppings to choose from (listed nicely with new signage) and don't forget to select a finishing sauce/glaze after the firing process."}
{"text":"Been here about 10 times, really enjoyed the food and staff every time, always get greeted with a genuine smile and they make my pizza exactly how I like it. I felt the need to make this account to give my first review because today I accidentally left about 1800$ in cash on the table and the manager and staff were all very honest and kept every dollar of it safe for me! Clearly some very professional employees and management at this place. Thank you! Blaze it up!"}
{"text":"Parking in Charlotte is always a task during rush hour so my sister and I walked to Blaze, ordered tasty pizzas and were back home in less than 30 minutes.  The staff were very nice and the place was spotless.  Nice job Blazers keep up the great service."}
{"text":"A fantastic place for quick and delicious pizza! If you love to chose your own toppings and customize your personal pizza, then this is the spot! So good at a really reasonable price!"}
{"text":"After the experience I had this evening, I needed to write a review. My sister and I decided on this place because it was close to home and had gluten free crust. My sister ordered her regular pizza and I ordered a regular to-go pizza for my husband, both of which only took about 10 minutes to order and cook (very fast considering how long the line was). I was told it would only be a few extra minutes for the gluten free, since they had to make the crust. I waited 28 minutes and still nothing. I decided I was done waiting and asked for a refund because I didn't want the pizza anymore. To my surprise, I was told the crust was ready but they couldn't find me. I was standing in the exact same spot hungrily staring at the counter for 28 minutes. I went through the line for toppings and everyone was sincerely nice and apologetic. The manager was extremely apologetic as well and refunded the money I spent on the gf pizza. Also, one of the other employees, who I don't believe was a manager, handed me a coupon for a free pizza next visit. I understand mistakes happen and I really appreciate how it was handled. Thank you. 

The pizza was AMAZING!! Best gf pizza I've had in awhile."}
{"text":"We have been to this Blaze Pizza location (about10 times) since they opened.  WE LOVE IT!!!

The employees are always so nice and interested in making the BEST PIE for us.  We have had the opportunity to meet Blaze Pizza team members Aurora, Jordan, Malak, Jasmine, Tori, Winston, Daniella and Summer and they have all been so very kind to us.  

Occasionally, we ask for a little more of this or a little more of that topping and they are always happy to add it to our pie!  The topping variety is insane -- IN A GOOD WAY!  Are you kidding me?  All those toppings for under 10 bucks?  Seriously, probably the best pizza we have had in PHX.  We like The Parlor, but this is closer to home and is more casual, fast and terrific especially when you don't have the time to wait for DELICIOUS quality pizza.

So, a big thanks to all of the peeps at Blaze Pizza that make it a great experience for us every time we come in.  That's why we keep coming back!!!!  See you soon. :)

P.S. - They have great fruit lemonades.  Our favorite is the Blood Orange.  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Had my first taste at this pizza joint on the east coast and was sad that there wasn't going to be any on the west coast or here in Vegas. Last week, I found out this opened not too long ago and my mind was blown! This is by far my favorite pizza joint! I've had my fare share of pizzas, but this beats them all! Super affordable for a personal pizza!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried it you should.  A Subway concept for pizza.  Pick your crust, pick your sauce, pick your toppings and in less than 2 minutes your hot delicious pizza is ready.  They also have wonderful fresh salads.  I had the seasonal with quinoa, roasted red peppers, feta and mixed greens with a delicious lime vinaigrette.  Only downside....i wanted a glass of wine and it is not available yet....guess they are waiting on their liquor license.  I was concerned that if they had a crowd it would be a wait but as I sat and watched they have the process figured out and the line moved smoothly...no back up at all.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Simple, casual, good food, plenty of choices. I went with the build your own pizza option. They have a nice variety of topping choices and the price can't be beat. Their special touch would have to be their house lemonade and Agua Fresca selections. As someone who almost always only orders water when I dine, I must say the prickly pear water and blood orange lemonade were worth the add on. 
The staff is colorful, present, thoughtful, and they seem happy to be there. I enjoyed my pizza (which was large enough to make two meals) and plan to return in the future. 
Decore is simple, nothing unique or ambient. And when it's busy the mixture of orders being called, patrons, and music can make things noisy. There is fairly open street parking with meters right by the restaurant as well as a free two hour parking option in a nearby deck. 
Why not 5 stars? It's certainly good, just don't know if it's the best pizza joint in town."}
{"text":"was a great choice.  everybody got their own pizza and loved it.  the variety of crusts.. including gluten free... made this the perfect combo for all.  do eat here.  you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I used to love Blaze. It's cheap, quick, and around the corner from my house. I went there yesterday and ordered a Hawaiian pizza. It was quite tasty, and I was very much looking forward to finishing my leftovers this evening. That is, until I opened my box and found mold on my pizza. Mold!!! On day old pizza! I'm pretty sure I survived on pizza for days during my college years and I've never seen anything like it. Needless to say, I don't think I'll be returning to Blaze. I recommend avoiding this location."}
{"text":"This place is great if you have small kids. For $5 you get a very good and cooked fast pizza. Perfect when your kids are hungry, tired and you just want a quick, good meal for a fair price.

One of the best things about this place is that you can order ahead online, set the time you'll be there and when you arrive to lay they'll fire your pizza. In less time than it took you to order and pay you'll be served a fresh, hot, good pizza. Your kids won't have to wait long. You won't have to hear them scream. And the folks eating around you will complement you on how well behaved your little monkeys are.

You'll be parent of the year. You'll write books. Jimmy Fallon will write songs about you. And you may even get asked to host Saturday Night Live because of how awesome you are."}
{"text":"The pizza here is great, and the idea of the restaurant is (I think almost) original. The only downside to it is the placement of the lids, and the amount of bugs inside. The placement of the lids is behind the shelf thing that holds the straws and stuff, and inbetween the soda machine and the tea machine. Because of this, it's really hard to find it."}
{"text":"Delicious thin crust pizza. This place had great customer service. First time eating at this particular pizza place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So glad this place opened down the street. So fast and so yum! If you're looking for good pizza that's fast and easy, Blaze is the place. Impressed!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great! and employees are all nice and professional i usually go in at lunch time and i always enjoy my pizza because its fired into perfection."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and I like the options. The problem is when you order online for pick up. We've done this four times and two of those were messed up. Today my step daughter picked up the pizza and when we got home one of the boxes was empty. When they do try to compensate you for your trouble they give you a coupon for a free pizza which can only be redeemed if you wait in line and eat there. They either need to step up their game or just stop the pick up orders if they can't handle it."}
{"text":"It was our first trying this place. My family is so picky, but we all liked it. Simple pizza is only $5.99. Kids like only cheese pizza. This works for them. My husband likes spicy red sauce pizza with pepaloni. The sauce is quite spicy. I like pesto with lot of veggies. With drinks, it was less than $30. It was very good. We tried Pieology, but my husband didnot like it. This place is cheaper, tastier, closer, and give bigger portion than Pieology. We will go back."}
{"text":"Basically a hyped up store frozen pizza prepared cafateria style."}
{"text":"Apparently today is their grand opening. Everyone was excited to be there and excited to help customers. While there are \"signature\" pizza options, this looks like it's more of a build your own pizza spot- you start at one end to get your crust/dough, and move down a long line of toppings and let 4-6 people know what things to go ahead and add before they throw it in a wood fired oven for a few minutes. What floored me was that the build your own pizza was under $8- with all the toppings your want! Most places start with plain cheese and charge you per topping. I think the plain cheese Simple Pie is $5 and a 1-topping is $6 and some change. The place is clean and well organized. 

My pizza had red sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, turkey meatballs, spinach, roasted garlic cloves, artichoke hearts, and olives- and it was amazing!! Filling, too - I only managed to finish about half of it (which means you can share... unless you and your friend can't agree on toppings).

I also grabbed the Tomato, Basil, Ovalini side salad $4- like a caprese with lots of greens! The favors were on point, and again I couldn't finish the whole thing."}
{"text":"I really like this place. We tried it out over the weekend and within 2 days, my wife and kid were asking to go again. 

The pizza is a great value. 8 bucks for as many toppings as you like on an 11 inch pizza is a great deal anywhere, but here its a steal. The toppings are quality and fresh. Combined with the wood fire cooking, it really makes for a tasty pizza. On top of it all, you'll be eating within minutes of ordering. 

The staff is always friendly and appear to be genuine, which goes a long way for a pleasant experience. The place jumps and I've been here during lunch and dinner rushes and the staff manages to handle things well while maintaining positive, warm attitudes. It truly is nice to see a well-staffed restaurant, while so many others try to handle the same amount of customers with half the staff.

All in all, big thumbs up to this place and I'm happy to welcome them to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This may be my favorite pizza in Toronto.

Mostly, I love the pizza. The crust is thin, but fresh. The gluten free option is also great. There are lots of toppings to choose from, or you can go for one of the pre-decided options on the menu. I like a custom pie with lots of mozzarella and pepperoni, spicy sauce, lots of cut cherry tomatoes, crushed garlic, mushrooms, basil, and fresh arugula once it's out of the oven. Mmm.

There are also a few salads and desserts which do not tempt me. There is a soda fountain (and iced tea, I believe) for drinks.

The price is very reasonable at about $15 for a custom (quite large) personal pizza and a soda.

The restaurant can be very busy but the service is fast. The line can get long, even out the door, at times, particularly on weekend evenings, but it usually moves quickly. Ordering is done along an \"assembly line\" style buffet. There are usually plenty of staff to build your pizza in front of you as you move down the line, and they have always been friendly. Cooking is also very fast (all pizzas are thin crust). Once you order, it is usually ready about a minute after you find a seat and fill your drink cup.

The ambiance is friendly fast-food. All staff have been friendly to me. Although there are self-serve garbage and tray depots, often the staff will take my \"mess\" for me at the table. The uniform is a T shirt. The tables are not fancy, but there are enough, and they are clean. I have always found a table seat, even when the place is busy, except for one time when I sat at the window counter.

Visited February 2016"}
{"text":"Fresh, made right as YOU pick your crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings! Fast casual dining, similar to chipotle or subway. Fresh daily made salads, and extremely friendly staff. I asked the lady to make me her favorite pizza and she did not disappoint. Chicken, bacon, basil, with Alfredo sauce! Love meat? They got every meat you can ask for. Hate meat? Re-evaluate yourself, but there is every vegetable you can think of! 10\" pizza for $8 can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza joint that just opened. Build your own pizza with unlimited toppings. I was helped by Priscilla and I can say she made our experience perfect! Definitely would recommend them especially with the price being about 7 bucks a pizza."}
{"text":"I loved Blaze Pizza back home, so I was SO excited to find Blaze in AZ! Everyone was so polite and the manager, Raul stopped by to check on us & chat. I'm happy to know they're opening more in AZ, but this location will definitely be my go-to!"}
{"text":"Every pizza is individual sized and definitely something you can devour on your own. They have a lot of toppings. You can get whatever you want with the build your own pizza for $10.45. Pizza was ready in less than 5 minutes. Wish it was cooked a little longer but it tasted great nonetheless. There's a lot of space to sit down and eat too. 

Oh and absolutely amazing service. Shout out to Alca! She was so nice and funny :)"}
{"text":"Overpriced pizza, very thin on toppings, not worthy of a second visit. There are plenty of other places around."}
{"text":"What a treat! Fresh, made to order pizza straight from the wood burning oven... umm yes please! They have some great toppings to choose from if you want to make your own pizza, or if you go with the other recipes on the menu , you're in good hands! I even received a coupon for buy one get one free :)"}
{"text":"The only complaint was it was loud with everything going on in there.  The pizza was good love that you can pick how much of everything you want for the price.  The mozz salad though was so so, dressing wasn't the best but my opinion only.   The blood orange lemonade was a great addition to the meal."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and I must say, I enjoyed every bite of my pizza... build my own with extra cheeses..so yummy .. I will surely visit again"}
{"text":"I really love the atmospheric vibe of Blaze Pizza as I walked in. I also love how they offer several choices and give you the choice of making your own pizza. The wait isn't short at all, and the employees are very kind and patient.

Even though I ordered a simple mozarella cheese pizza with a classic sauce and spinach on top, it was still a spectacular experience. Not greasy at all like most of the pizza places in Vegas, which is definitely rare. The crust also complemented the the toppings. I really appreciated everything about this place and will definitely be back to hang out with some friends and family."}
{"text":"Super happy Blaze is near me!  Great pizza - great service.  Manager Steve I awesome!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Pizza tasted great and you can't beat the price! Whole roasted garlic cloves-yum! Basil, feta, mozzarella, Italian sausage, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, and onions in a mix of white and red sauce. So good. Pizza was so big that I could only eat 2 slices. Took the rest home. But what great leftovers I have for tomorrow. Unless of course my kids eat everything. Who am I kidding? They will. Anyway, definitely will return. Worth the 10 minute drive from my house. Service is UNBEATABLE! Best service I have had in years. The guy that was sweeping the floor asked us if we were doing ok as he walked by us. Who does that at a fast food restaurant? Everyone who worked there was attentive and friendly, and it was a very busy night. Not sure if it would be as good if I didn't eat it there. 180 seconds in the oven really doesn't get the toppings hot enough to last a drive home. All in all, great pizza!"}
{"text":"Ate here 3x in one week. Don't judge. ;) So....yes, it's that good. Pizzas are delicious, customer service is awesome, it's not gonna hurt your wallet (unless you eat there 3x in a week), and it's fast and convenient...but not fast food-esque. You can build-your-own or choose a signature pizza...the Red Vine (pretty much a margherita pizza) is a amazing."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here, and is now my new favorite pizza place. I choose to build my own pizza. There are a large variety of cheeses and toppings and it's all included in the price of the \" build your own\" . They also have signature pizzas as well. The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Fast, easy and delicious! Great selection of toppings, different sauces, gluten free crust and vegan cheese. This place has a lot to offer and is ridiculously tasty!"}
{"text":"It was never so easy to built your own pizza with multiple options on almost every step. Their pesto and garlic sauce is delicious. Also the lemonade is one of the best in the time of hot summers. Walking distance for the eaton centre mall hard to miss. If you are not a pizza person...then try their thin crust pizza base it will sure kick your tastebuds ! Best part of this place it they don't over charge for the multiple toppings  ! Worth every penny $"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Awesome customer service and the pizza was cooked fast. Overall I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I like the custom built pizza trend. Blaze offers quality ingredients at a fair price. On my visit there was plenty of staff, but they seemed to be stepping on each others toes. It was a lengthy wait for our pizza to be fired, but the finished product was tasty and the crust remained crisp. Which is no easy task when piling on the toppings. It's still new, so in time I think they'll find their groove."}
{"text":"Blaze is on fiyaaaaah, and I'm very sorry to have to be the 2102301310th person to make that joke.  But trust me, it's true.

When a good friend recommended this place to me and insisted on treating me to a Blaze Pizza, I was immediately skeptical.  I have a pretty strong theory that you can only have 2 out of 3 things from any dining establishment located in close proximity to Dundas Square: 1) Quality  2) Affordability  3) Great customer service.  

Well, colour me impressed - Blaze meets and exceeds all 3 criteria. Yes, you really *can* have your cake (or rather, pie) here and eat it too!  On my first visit, I was greeted by the friendliest staff that took the time to efficiently explain to me how Blaze works. A basic rundown: You can get a personal pie that is thin-crust, load it up with unlimited toppings (yes, unlimited! I basically had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming) at a set price, and watch it get fast-fired in a large fire oven in 180-ish seconds.

The Good: HUGE shout outs to Alca, who deserves a promotion and unlimited pizzas forever and more!  For me, Alca is the face of Blaze Pizza - she's been there every time I've visited (so, a lot), and every time, she greets each customer with patience, enthusiasm and a smile.  She gave me a great impression of the place from the start - it's so refreshing to see someone who genuinely enjoys their job, and Alca brings such warmth to Blaze with her welcoming, upbeat attitude and contagious laughter. She even remembers regulars' names, which, considering the amount of customers Blaze gets, must not be an easy feat!  Big thanks to Alca for being a role model for what every server in Toronto should be like.  When I say Blaze has great customer service, I have Alca in mind. :)  Definitely greet her with a smile the next time you see her - she's awesome!

-They don't skimp on their topics. The unlimited toppings here are really high quality, and would usually add up to a lot in any other pizza joint.  From an assortment of fresh veggies and basic ingredients to things like pesto, artichokes, arugala (!), chopped garlic, and cloves of roasted garlic (my favourite), this place has almost everything and something for every palette. 
 
-Blaze is really, really fast.  I sometimes stare in wonder and amazement at the guy blazin' up those pizzas. It's an art, and the man does it with such diligence - I've always had my pizzas from here come out fast, crisp, and perfectly toasted, never burnt or overdone or underdone. They've got it down to a science here!

-Unlimited drink refills (which Alca was kind enough to tell me!)  I never thought lemonade could pair well with pizza, but I was wrong. It's a genius pairing.

-*TIP*: You can get the best of both worlds if you can't decide between pesto or red sauce!  I like to go half-and-half. You can customize the pie any way you want, so you get to try (and enjoy) a bit of everything.

-They have to-go boxes, and unlimited parmesan, hot pepper flakes, and oregano/basil (I can't remember which) on the side for you to grab and load up your pizza with when you sit down.

-They also have take-out boxes on the side that you can grab if you choose to have your pizza indoors, and don't finish it! (In that case, though, what's wrong with you...just kidding. I think the whole accessible just-in-case take-out box concept is great and pretty innovative.)

The Bad: Sometimes, it can get a little busy and seating can be limited (I've never experienced it personally, but my dad goes regularly during lunch rush hour and tells me this is the case.) My trick is, if you really want a seat and it's too packed at Blaze during lunchtime, take your pie up to the foodcourt in the adjacent building, the floor right below the movie theatres. Grab a drink or something from there, and enjoy. There's usually plenty of seating in the food court and it's just a one minute walk/elevator ride away.

The Ugly: Nada."}
{"text":"Let's be fair here, the frozen dough is below average, sauces are above average, ingredients are above average, cheeses are high above average, the technique is above average, and the price point is high above average. Still yet to try made in-house dough, that may improve things. 

This is the best cheap pizza you will find in the NE. The amount of awful pizza places up here with no quality control and the cheapest of ingredients is staggering. I don't think I have returned to a single place I have tried besides blaze. Still much room for improvement as far as good pizza is concerned, but until someone opens that venture close by I will be returning."}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza was very attentive to my Gluten allergy and each employee went out of their way to assist me.  They changed their gloves at each station, placed my gluten free pizza onto a separate cooking sheet, so that the pizza would not touch the oven's surface (Avoiding cross contamination).  A different cutter was used to slice my pizza and the end result was very good.  I chose the build you own option, loaded my pizza with toppings, which tasted superb.  I'll definitely be going back for more pizza in the future.  Great service, friendly employees made for a fantastic experience.  Two Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great with extremely good pricing. My only complaint would be the customer service sometimes. I work right across the street so i can see when it isn't a busy time to come in and get my meal. When anyone walks in the first thing you should get is a greeting and fast service, especially in a place like this. On occasion ill walk in when nobody is in line and see a bunch of the young employees touching each other and messing around in front of everyone or get several deer in the headlights looks and nobody jumping to take my order for what seems like minutes because they all suddenly have something else they got to do. Other then that its a nice, fast paced dine in."}
{"text":"I've been here now 5 times and each time I have not been disappointed. If you wish to eat a pizza that's easy on your wallet, as well as your waistline, come here! Love the fact you \"build\" your own and you can put as many toppings on for $7.65. This is a personal sized pizza in which there are 6 slices. All pizzas are wood fired and usually take about 3-4 minutes to complete. I usually bring my son and he really enjoys the pizza here too. Service is really good, and the employees are super sweet, helpful, and are always smiling. We are customers for life!"}
{"text":"First time here, very noisy, the staff is friendly but a little unorganized. Its Friday night at 8pm. I like the crust better at the competition.  The pie was good. They also serve beer or wine. Great topping select and 3 choices of crust. Lots of parking. From start to finish 10-15 min. Great soda choices and iced teas. Alfredo sauce  needs more taste. Sausage a bit over salty.  I would come back."}
{"text":"I hope the pizza is better than the service! Ordered online and got there a bit early, but let them know I was there. They told me the pizza hadn't gone in the oven yet. I waited and saw when my pizzas were finished. For some reason, the person behind the counter decided to serve everyone else's pizza before ours, but we were standing right there. Then, once ours were finally boxed, my name was never called and I had to get them myself...Two stars are because they were at least done by my call time."}
{"text":"Even though this place is big the decor makes it feel warm and welcoming. The pizza is amazing, customizable to every individual's taste and dietary restrictions and is made with care.  I'm so glad they opened in Summerlin! A must try!"}
{"text":"I visited Blaze this evening after reading the reviews on Yelp and was somewhat disappointed. The staff is super, friendly, accommodating and conversant with the clients. I ordered the pizza with the chicken and arugula and added peppers. The truth is that the best part of the pizza was the crust, the chicken was bland and the entire pizzas got cold fast and was just nothing really special.I don't have to go back again and know of a few other eateries where the pizzas are superb and very memorable."}
{"text":"If your looking for a fast easy pizza, this is your place. I had a good pizza unlimited toppings is good, but i like a less messy pizza, for me its all about the crust.  

The crust is very lacking, my pizza was very chewy even for a thin crust. My wifes pizza on the other hand was burnt so bad on the bottom it was horrible, the line was crazy so we just went for desert.

Oh and the decor should have been revised inside, there is nothing to soak up the noise, and music so it sounds like an empty warehouse. Normal conversation is ok as long as your only 3 feet away."}
{"text":"Love this place! Blaze is right by my house and is a convenient place to grab a quick lunch or dinner. The place is almost like a Subway for pizza. You walk into the restaurant and you can either pick one of their specialty pizzas or creat your own. The best part about this place is that you can create your own pizza with as many toppings as you want with no extra charge! The pizzas here are on a thin crust so not everyone I take here enjoys it. For dessert, you can order a Smore Pie that is delicious and melts in your mouth. Their employees are pretty friendly and the place looks cool. I warn you though, if you come during the lunch rush, the line goes out the door and there is no room to sit. This place is just that good!

What exactly do I order? Create your own pizza with white sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, bacon, extra bacon, extra extra bacon, garlic, sautéed onions, basil, pineapple, mushroom, roasted red peppers, oregano, spinach, extra spinach, and arugula to top it off:)"}
{"text":"Good pizza, very good service. You know the deal: pick the dough, pick sauce, pick toppings, wait 2 minutes, receive pizza, eat pizza, write review. The chocolate chip cookie is pretty good, too. Good overall experience. Will certainly go back again."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Blaze!  So reasonably priced. Love that I could put any toppings on at no additional cost. Great selection of toppings. Will definitely be back!  Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Made my own pizza. I called it \"tZe michelle\". Unlimited toppings is the best feature of this place. Don't forget to drizzle the olive oil on top as a last step. We enjoyed every bite of this pizza. Definitely going back again. Sorry pizza pizza. We are ditching you."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great concept, one terrible experience. Brought my girlfriend in for her first time because I had found a BOGO offer, couldn't find the offer and but showed them a screenshot of the SAME offer they had run in January that was expired. I asked if there was anything they could do, and they told me no. While disappointed I understood and paid my bill in full. It was after my pie came out of the oven I asked for \"a little bit\" of the balsamic sauce, the guy then proceeds to completely drown my pie with the black sauce after which he looks back to the lady whom I assume was the manager at that time as if to ask for guidance at his obvious mistake. I understand new employees mess up, I've been there, but the fact that she did not damage control whatsoever is unacceptable. I walked in expecting to get an awesome deal on some great food, and instead paid double what I wanted getting one great pizza for my girlfriend and one pizza that was almost inedible. Was gonna let go then by complete accident the BOGO popped on my feed and its code was the SAME as the BOGO offered in January. So disapointing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend stumbled upon this place and noticed how busy it akways is so we had to try it ourselves, oh boy!... It did not disappoint.

Into simple words Blaze is : Fresh pizzas - made right in front of you - affordable and DE-LI-CIOUS. 

I've been to Italy and Blaze beats most pizzas I've had there.

As a first customer; they add a \"smiley face\" to your pizza and tell you step by step what they're doing and add their recommendations. I went for the \"Art Lover\" artichokes,  ricotta, garlic.. I even added arugula after it came out of the fire oven. It turned out AMAZING. 

Also have a look at the sauces and juice bar. The blood orange limonade put a smile on my face :)"}
{"text":"We went and used our free pizza coupon we got in the mail. My husband ordered an extra pepperoni and extra cheese pizza. We really loved it and will definitely be back! Not too greasy and very flavorful!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza I had in Toronto, especially if you like thin crust.
Very friendly staff. The place was not too busy when I was there on Saturday for lunch.
Pricing is competitive, considering the location on Dundas Square."}
{"text":"So the pizza isn't bad but the employees need a bit of training. When asked about any additional salads the answer was \"nope, sorry.\" How about they stay on top of their inventory or maybe make the requested salad. That's lost revenue!

Then the dining area is filthy and there is literally a sign on the trash can that says it is full and to use a different one. How about you empty the overflowing trash instead of making a sign? 

One and done I think."}
{"text":"Good simple concept with quality ingredients, only fault is the wine selection is not good, and the beer selection didn't do much for me.  Easy to make a good pizza, if you order something that is on the menu, you can easily change the ingredients around.  Good price too.  Felt a little weird to be eating in the old Zia Records that I spent so many years at shopping for music!"}
{"text":"First of all, the pizza from Blaze was delicious! The restaurant is tucked away in the parking lot in between Sunridge Mall and Chuck E Cheese. 

When you walk in there are a good amount of places to sit if you want to eat in. They have booths and high top tables. It seemed to be family friendly:)

You walk up to order and it's kind of a pizza assembly line. You pick which crust you want and go down the line and add the toppings. I was impressed with the selection of toppings to choose from, including a few different kinds of cheeses and drizzles to go on top of your pizza creation. You can put as much or as little as you'd like:) After you are happy with your toppings you pay for your pizza and then wait with anticipation for 180 seconds while it comes together in the big blazing pizza oven. Note..It seems longer when you're hungry.

The crust turned out perfect for me! It was golden and a bit crunchy, not thick and not paper thin. 

The staff at Blaze were friendly and helpful. I definitely recommend giving Blaze a try if you're in the area. It's a great addition to the NE Calgary dining scene!"}
{"text":"Decent food for a good price, as long as you understand you are buying fast food.  Ordered a build your own pizza, original (thin) crust, red sauce, mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, sausage, olives, bacon, and onions.  After baking for 3 minutes, I get my pizza.   Crust is good, bottom is cooked well, dark brown but not burnt.  Due to the fast food aspect, the top of the crust was still raw (chewy texture, not cooked), and the toppings were cold.  Again, you need to way your options here...if you are looking for fast food pizza that is edible, this is your place.   If your are looking for a delicious, hot, true pizza experience, you're not going to get it here."}
{"text":"Came to this location on a whim one night to try it out, and it just so happened to be the Durango location's opening weekend. (We initially tried to go there first unknowing how crazy the line would be.) The line wrapped the inside of the building and at times edged outside, but my girlfriend and I were hungry and the people in front of us in line had adorable kids who were entertaining. If the line was out the door, it had to be worth the wait right? Definitely. 

We waited about 30-45 minutes in line and we're finally greeted with extraordinarily nice employees who explained the process. Got our pizzas all picked out and sent to the oven, paid, picked a seat, and in just a matter of minutes our names were called. Crazy good! Even with all the craziness of that night, the employees were all working very hard and the restaurant remained clean the entire time. 

I used to work at a pizza place similar to Blaze, and you guys blow it out of the water, mainly because I appreciate how everyone behind the sneeze guard works in unison, without confusion, and with tidy efficiency. Thanks Blaze!"}
{"text":"I got 2 build-your-own pizzas. One had pesto sauce and the other had the spicy red sauce. Both were good for a 8 dollar pizza. The crust is thin and foldable. The cheese is in spots and not all over. I saw other pictures and expected this so I ordered it with three types of cheese to cover it and it still didn't. I asked for bbq drizzle on one and either it was so little I couldn't tell it was there or they forgot to put it on. All-in-all I did still liked it. I added my own bbq pulled pork topping at home to give it more substance. I didn't like the order online feature because you have to pay online with a card. There is no option to pay cash in the store."}
{"text":"I am not completely sure how I feel about writing a review of free pizza day, but here goes nothing.

I arrived around 1:15 on free pizza day, expecting a line. I believe I waited about 25 minutes or so, which I thought was incredibly fast given that there was a line out the door and around the corner. 

The Staff at Blaze is incredibly nice. They speak to you by name, which just goes a long way for me. While your pizza passes down the line, you are greeted by friendly and courteous staff. 

The pizza line has so many different toppings that are unlimited....the word unlimited is such a problem in my life because that then means that I just want everything! On this occasion, I harnessed in my inner glutton and went with the Art Lovers pizza and added chicken and bacon. I loved that ricotta and the red sauce was added in chunks. At first I was apprehensive about not having the red sauce spread like a typical pizza. However, I think having the chunks throughout made the pizza! The pizza was delish and I loved the crunchiness of the crust (plus, it cooked in 3 minutes!!). 

I love the concept behind this place and think it is an excellent addition to the South End area!"}
{"text":"Wow I'm here right now having a pizza meant to come here when they opened never had a change  so happy I came in  $10.00 wow wow wow....fantiscfic they don't call  it gourmet at least they are honest about it but it is get pizza and cheap .......keep it up Blaze keep it up"}
{"text":"Omgeee I'm in love Blaze pizza all over again! I usually go to the South End location but I'm closer to the Concord location when I'm working...I stopped in today and Steve greeted me with a big smile and welcomed me in. I have a dairy allergy so when I disclosed that they immediately changed their gloves and used all clean utensils without me asking. My pizza took no time to cook and taste like heaven! I will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"For all the pizza lovers in Toronto, a new pizza joint has just opened up shop, and it's awesome! Blaze Pizza describes itself as a custom built artisanal pizza shop. In other words, it's the Chipotle or Subway of pizza. Customers can order a signature pizza dish or build their own with a wide variety of toppings to choose from, and let me tell you, there's a lot! I would highly recommend building your own pizza as this is where you get your money's worth. 

For only $10.45, customers can choose from the whole menu of toppings with an unlimited amount. Blaze pizza offers a wide variety of pizza sauces such as the classic tomato sauce or white cream sauce (think alfredo). 

For veggie lovers, there's a wide variety of vegetable toppings to choose from such as arugula, banana peppers, zucchini, and banana peppers just to name a few. 

For the meat lovers, there's also a wide variety of meat toppings such as applewood bacon, pepperoni, or Italian sausage. 

All of the toppings are made fresh and well prepared with nicely cut portions unlike other pizza joints who have the tendency to just lazily cut up huge chunks and throw it on the pizza. All of the pizzas are made fresh on the spot and are \"fast fired\" with customers being able to chow down on their pizza concoction within 5 minutes or so of ordering. 

As for my pizza concoction, I had mines made with classic red sauce, goat cheese, mozzarella, pineapple, bell peppers, mushrooms, applewood bacon, italian sausage, and smoked ham. Feel free to try out my signature pizza dish!"}
{"text":"So our pizzas were at a perfect temperature so we could dive right in after tugging apart some of the slices. No burned edges and the toppings were evenly placed. My niece wants me to note that her fingers taste like pizza! I think this almost 6 year old will be eating her whole cheese pizza because of the fresh mozzarella and reg mozzarella plus spinach made it sooo darn tasty! The blueberry hibiscus drink was worth it to get a drink on this free pizza day! And the ceasar salad is fresh and crisp! 
Super friendly service and we didn't feel rushed at all! And the s'more cookie will be a welcome treat later!"}
{"text":"The staff is nice and the toppings are fresh.  But each pizza crust was not very good and a bit raw and not that great."}
{"text":"Not good. The pre-formed pizza dough was burned around the edges and turned the texture and flavour of cardboard as soon as it came out of the gas fueled ovens (wood gives things a nice flavour, gas does nothing). You are better off getting pizza at the kids restaurant across the parking lot."}
{"text":"First time to Blaze Pizza, can't beat it, $7.95 for any top pizza. Great deal and very fresh. Good for lunch or dinner. I'll definitely be back. At this price, you can afford to experiment with all the toppings you've ever wanted. The varieties of toppings and cheese is amazing."}
{"text":"My friends and I love coming to Blaze. Not only is the food amazing, but the employees are strikingly personable and genuine. 
**Whoever decided to put Nate to work as the host was very wise. Every experience at Blaze when he is on the clock has been phenomenal. He always has a smile on his face and never misses an opportunity to lend a hand. 
Nate comes in clutch every time. We hope you get the recognition you deserve!"}
{"text":"AMAZING, I loved every bite ...every slice
Great texture crust with an awesome crunch."}
{"text":"i love blaze. it does take awhile to get through the mid day rush but its a cheap lunch and you can build your own pizza! awesome place and ill be back soon."}
{"text":"I don't need to many words to recommend this place Our best pizza place in Vegas , sister had tried  pizza at. $$$ restaurants and she felt in love with blaze , so did I and all our family !!!!! Everything fresh and the flavors  , the staff  so nice , just love blaze pizza  100 percent I recommend this  place above all pizza places 
Try it !!!! We always get garlic pesto sauce and marinara on top and oh my goodness !!! Heaven !!!! Add your toppings and don't forget the roasted garlic and minced garlic ( if you love garlic ) and you will want to eat pizza everyday !!!!"}
{"text":"Took over 30 minutes to get my 3 pizzas. Got first one at about 15 minutes, the second at about 28 minutes and the third about 35 minutes. Which I ordered online so they should have been ready when I got there 15 minutes later. They forgot toppings on my first pizza which was cold by the time all my other pizzas were ready and they didn't remake it. BTW, It was the 2 cheese pizzas that I ordered that took the longest, yes.... 35 minutes for a cheese pizza. The manager offered me coupons to buy more pizzas and said \"I'll check on what happened.\" Only offering \"I'm sorry\" before she walked off not to be seen again."}
{"text":"I've seen Blaze Pizza in California when I lived there, but never had the chance to try it until now. I do love how quick they are... and how i can custom design my own flavors and have it ready in less than 5 minutes Their pizzas are delicious and most importantly convenient when you want to satisfy your pizza crave. The location is perfect, even though there is a line, the customer service is excellent. Love how you can easily see your ingredients and you can even watch your pizza cook. Going to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite pizza joint ever. I am sick to death of paying a buck for each extra topping because I love my pizza loaded. Talk about fast and friendly service. If you have not tried this you gotta go."}
{"text":"This place is great!! They were super helpful to explain everything since I hadn't been better! The possibilities of pizza combinations are endless and I cannot wait to go back!! Quality ingredients, quality staff and a fast, delicious pizza it doesn't get much better than that!! 

Parking was easy a free in a parking deck right at Blaze. It's also right along the light rail for easy access! Definitely go check it out!!"}
{"text":"They were super nice. It was clean and the pizza was good. My twins loved making their own pizza!! Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"First time and really enjoyed it. I had my doubts - I walked in to a line of about 20 people. I thought 'this is going to take forever' but I was wrong. The employees were super nice and quickly get you thru. I had my pizza and salad within 10 mins! Loved the make your own pizza. Crust was crusty, the sauce spicy and as much toppings as you'd like. Overall a great first time-will come back."}
{"text":"Great pizza, love these places because you can add whatever you want and you get restaurant quality without the price, wait, or having to leave a tip. It's basically the Chipotle for pizza with a ton of options."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want the best pizza in town! Angelo made my pizza just how I like it and Tj cooked it perfectly as well. Paris was so polite checking up on my friend and I. She made sure we didn't need anything and our pizza was to our liking. Also to the GM of this place keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Fantastic thin crust pizza !! Great fresh toppings!!! And awesome friendly staff !! 
Will return again and again and again !!"}
{"text":"I went there on about 5 or 6 times. Each time I had to deal with the same problem, which is...
Messy pizza makers. They are so messy, the red sauce has droppings of the white sauce. My last visit the red sauce had white sauce in it. Everything is all mixed up. I.E. bacon in the veggies. They have no regards for keeping things in its own container. Very dissatisfied and disappointed that they take no care in keeping things neat and orderly. Because their pizza's were good, but I just can not go back because it is sickening to watch them make customers pizza. The staff is very friendly but messy."}
{"text":"Wow - Pizza at its best.  Fresh ingredients and lovely service.  People in this place look so happy to be at work and nice team work.  Pizza in 3 minutes and build your own pizza, can have as much and as many toppings you want.  Love this place, love the Pizza, love the suggestions & love the service ..... BIG THUMBS UP.  You will see me more often"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Similar to some other pizza chains I have tried in the States. A little skimpy on the toppings."}
{"text":"Great pizza! The quality of food is excellent and very filling. Wonderful customer service, too! I accidentally left my wallet in the store after our meal. I gave them a call after I realized I lost it, and they found it and had already put it in the back to keep it safe. Definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"This place is great! For $11.65 you get unlimited toppings on your pizza. You can order online ahead of time and then go pick if up, although keep in mind that they won't fire your pizza until you arrive and pay. It cooks very quickly though, so there isn't much wait time. The crust is very thin, but I like thin crust pizzas so it suit me fine, but if you like thicker crusts, you can add $2 for a thicker one, although i should note that it's still not 'thick'.. it'd be more like a regular crust at another place. 
The flavour of the pizza is surprisingly great, especially for a fast-food type pizza place. the flavour definitely beats the regular pizza pizza, pizzaiolo..etc, especially since you can get any toppings you want. I especially love the spicy tomato base! It's no gourmet pizza that you can find at a nice italian restaurant, but honestly for a quick lunch or dinner, it doesn't get better than this! The pizza is a really decent size. I'd say one may be enough for two to share if you aren't very hungry or don't eat much, but when hungry, I can easily eat the entire thing by myself.
The location is really nice too, it's right off of dundas square and if you grab a seat by the window, it's great for people watching. I've been here a couple of time already and the people who work there have always been super friendly too. Love this place!"}
{"text":"For Neapolitan pizza that isn't ridiculously overpriced you can't beat Blaze. The dough is great ingredients are fresh, tasteful, and it's super quick."}
{"text":"Always very busy during peak hours, so brace yourself for the crowd and noise.
The crust is thin crust and you can choose from all kinds of toppings.. at no extra cost! I always make my basil-garlic pesto-bacon-onion-olives combo, but you can throw on anything you like.
BTW, they will ask if you want your crust covered with the pesto/sauce whatever. This creates a reaaaally greasy pizza.
We had leftovers and tried it reheated the next day. It was even better!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place but after waiting in line for 5 minutes I found out they don't have anchovies and there's no list of toppings on the menu. So now I'm annoyed and just walked out. What kind of \"real\" pizza place doesn't have anchovies. Please step your game up Blaze. I'm disappointed in you guys."}
{"text":"This is a new blaze location in Phoenix. The space used to be a jewelry store and now it serves fast casual pizza. What they've done to the space is pretty cool: there's and indoor seating area and a covered outdoor area. 
The pizza is good and fast and the topping selection is decent."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here yesterday for Pi Day and it didn't disappoint. We waited in line for about 2 hours and we thought about giving up and leaving a few times but I'm sure glad that we didn't. The pizza is the best I've had in the city, there is so many options to pick from. Something for everyone. They have veg options and even gluten free. If you haven't tried this place yet you are missing out. You gotta eat here !"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and wine! Good value you can have your pizza anyway you want. I ordered salad Caesar wasn't impress would definitely come back for pizza!"}
{"text":"We love this place everyone was great especially Ryan, when we explained that my Auntie/Mom is allergic to wheat / gluten they took extra care that everyone was aware and didn't cross contaminate. The pizza and the prices are phenomenal we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch for the first time at Blaze Pizza.

First impression: I came in and didn't know the premise of how to order the pizza. The worker noticed how puzzled we looked and offered to explain how to order. We ended up going with the one topping pizza and one of their signature pizzas. The great thing about it is with their pizza it's limited toppings! 

The pizza was cooked in this oven and took about a minute. Fast!

Food: the pizza was thin crust which I personally liked and it was quite pleasant. Not too greasy and they were generous with the toppings. 

Overall: I would definitely return during lunch as this was a quick and easy lunch. The seating area is really nice too."}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza is AMAZING! It was fast, delicious and the atmosphere was fantastic; laid back, energetic and extremely comfortable. The pizzas are the perfect size for two and they leave you satisfied and not feeling like you've swallowed a tub of lard. They have a huge selection of toppings and the build-your-own pizzas give you an opportunity to venture out and experiment with delicious combinations. I can't believe I've been in Charlotte for two years and just now discovered this place. Blaze is officially my go-to pizza joint."}
{"text":"Great concept.  Quality ingredients.  Very friendly service. But......
Ordered at 11:45 am for a 12:10 pickup. 
Instructions were to go to the cash. Pay. And they would have order ready for quick fire cooking. 
At the restaurant there were over 25 people in line waiting to order. I asked about bypassing the line to cash.  The greeter said absolutely.  I paid.  And waited. And waited.  All 25 people + more came through the line and got their pizzas. I finally asked if my order was coming soon and they found it off to the side. Staff were apologetic but my order was not complete (missing items) and it was cold.  
A free pop was offered.  Great gesture. I have to say many local companies might not have even offered that. 
The cold pizza was good.  I hope process improvements are done soon.  They were very busy.  
Final comments.  Many people had free pizza coupons.  Had I had that I would not be writing."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Shout out to Raeshawn who made my Pizza. Was able to choose unlimited amount of toppings for my pizza. Pesto with chopped garlic is boombb!"}
{"text":"I was bummed that I missed their big event last week as I was out of town. We were in the area and very excited to try this place especially based on the rave reviews. We ordered ahead as it is better than waiting 20 to 30 minutes upon arrival for your order.

They had several tasty choices. We ordered the Green Stripe - Classic dough, shredded mozzarella, grilled chicken, garlic, roasted red peppers, arugula and pesto drizzle. I provide all the ingredients to establish a visual. Based on the name alone, one would expect to see some green on the pizza. More details in a bit. We ordered with a pickup time at 5:50 pm. 

Upon arrival just past the pickup time, we were expecting to take and go. So unlike all other online ordering eateries, this one creates your pizza and waits for you to arrive to \"Fire it up\". This was mentioned on the email but we missed it. Ok, so we waited 15 minutes, when the male prepping the cooked pizzas called out \"Chuck\". No one appeared to pick up the order. And we waited, five minutes later, the same male, looked at the receipt again and then called \"Brad\". Yay, this was us, unfortunately it sat there and we still had a drive home. So much for a hot pizza. Ok, so I get maybe the reasoning behind not cooking the pizza until the customer arrives in order for the pizza to be hot upon pickup. Good concept, except in this instance it failed. The best system, in my opinion, is providing the customer a pickup time and it's up to the customer to arrive at this time for their food to be hot.  

We got home, opened the box and I said, \"Where's the green?\" We ended up with all ingredients except the arugula and pest drizzle. So ironically, the term \"green\" refers to someone, or in this case restaurant, who is not yet experienced in a particular field or activity. Blaze has some kinks to work out for sure. If we are in the area again and we feel like a pizza, we may stop back in to give them another chance. For now, I prefer to wait a bit."}
{"text":"Great concept: Chipotle for pizza. For around $8 get a pizza with lots of fresh toppings and great sauces the ends up being around 6 slices. Enough for one or two people. The crust is thin, fresh and chewy. I got the simple pie and shared with my mother for mother's day. My sister and her husband shared the BBQ chicken. We sat outside on a gorgeous sunny day and enjoyed our made to order pizza. Thin crust, lots of toppings, authentic, fast, good prices."}
{"text":"So glad to have tried this place out. This is now my go to pizza joint near my house! It is definitely the best around here if you like thin pizza. The prices are reasonable and I honestly have no complaints. I read the reviews before ordering but a friend had actually tried it and loved it so I decided to take my chances! After the first bite I was in love. I couldn't believe this place was near my house and I hadn't tried it yet. I will for sure be ordering here on the regular. I kept it simple just to be safe and ordered pepperoni pizza. The flavor of the sauce was perfect and the cheese was just right. It is a thin pizza and the crust was perfect to me. Delivery time didn't take long at all. I've tried so many pizza places in Vegas and I have my favorites and this will go on the list as one of them. This place also reminds me of Pizza Rev which I love as well!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this location. My first visit was OK. There's a Pieology not far from here so it was a decent comparison.  Overall I thought it was similar in quality and product. However today was a serious let down. The employees at this location just don't care.  Very disappointed.  Today I watched an employee spend 10 minutes cutting all the crust off my pizza because it was burned so badly while I watched.  I was stunned. When I commented that the pizza was burnt she commented, \"no it's not\" as she continued cutting the black charcoal crust off my pizza with the pizza cutter, which by the way, did not work very well. She then lifted the pizza to show me the charred bottom and said, \"If you want me to remake it, it will come out the same way, that's just the way it is.\"  

OK, mistakes happen right?

She should have noticed I was not happy and instead of continuing to cut the crust off my pizza she SHOULD HAVE STOPPED and said, \"I'm sorry, you're right it's burnt, let me make you a new one.\"  BUT SHE DIDN'T.

I would have been fine to wait, mistakes happen, but to act like it's normal to spend 10 minutes cutting the crust off a burnt pizza when you could have remade it faster was inexcusable.
 
Thankfully there are many lunch options for my team and I and we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Updated review: chaotic and very sad that blaze continues to hire people that are clueless on what \"Blaze\" means. They are slower than molasses here and literally had one person making pizzas on a Friday night!!! Why?!??

We are huge Blaze fans! We have been going to the Blaze in university for about four months now. When the one opened in Concord, we were thrilled. We went on a Monday afternoon and it was not super busy. They did not skimp on the cheese and they even had a new product \"the dough knots\". They weren't the best but they were good. I will definitely be back based on the quality food and pizza."}
{"text":"For thin crust pizza , OMG!!!!Staff is extremely friendly, beverage selection solid
  It is a winner!!!  Been there 3 times in 2 weeks"}
{"text":"Usually I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza but ohmygod, Blaze does it so so so well. And unlimited toppings! The world is definitely my oyster. Service was great as well, from the moment my boyfriend and I stepped into the store. The server welcomed us graciously and offered to explain the menu to us. 

TLDR; Fast, fresh and delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Easy, quick, and convenient for a quick meal!
Love how you can choose your own toppings so I don't have to fight with my husband on the toppings ;) 
The place is clean and the staff are friendly!"}
{"text":"It is located in the same lot of the North Las Vegas LVAC. Blazed was really spacious and clean. The staff was very attentive and friendly. I couldn't decide between the Red Vine or White Top specialty pizzas, so a worker mentioned how you can do half-half... One pizza on one side, and the other. One specialty pizza has 6 slices. It was so good I finished it in one setting.  The ingredients were fresh. They have a variety of vegetables and meats. They prepare it in front of you and place it in the fire oven. I requested they put pesto all over the top of pizza after it was baked. You can also request for them to make your own pizza if you don't want the speciality kind. They utilize the production line teamwork like Subway. I was also impressed at how affordable it was too for the satisfying taste quality. I will definitely come here again.  I have already recommended it to my friends. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Super friendly and helpful staff, I am glutten free and vegan, I have tried another place with similiar concept, Blaze really did a much better job, the staff is excellent and all very attentive. A much better value than the other spot, I litterally paid half the cost at Blaze for and recieved more more toppings, and a much better dinning and service experience.  Cheaper and better food and service.  They use Daiya for their dairy free plant based cheese. Good spicy red sauce. and soooo many toppings."}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly outgoing staff - Kayla. Friendly and upbeat on a Saturday night (Halloween) at 11pm!"}
{"text":"This place is brilliant! Blaze is set up like subway or chipotle which is fun. The ingredients are fresh the prices are amazing (a cheese pizza is only $5) and the pizza is delicious. The service is friendly and quick; and as a true pizza lover I couldn't be more excited about this place. For $2 more than a \"hot and ready\" pizza you can get a fresh fired pizza of your own design with unlimited toppings!"}
{"text":"Found this place via yelp and it was pretty good. If you \"create your own pizza,\" you can choose your crust, type of sauce and all of your toppings but there are also several specialty pizzas on the menu that may suit your taste (and you can also alter those for no extra cost). Pizzas are 11 inches each. I got the \"white top\" pizza which comes with white cream sauce, garlic, arugula and mozzarella but I added basil, goat cheese, tomatoes and mushrooms. It was pretty good. I got a side Caesar salad as well which was delicious though a little pricey for the size of it. I'd definitely go back to try another pizza.

They have online ordering which is a huge plus. When I got to the restaurant, I only waited one minute which is how long it takes to cook the pizza (they waited until I got there to put the pizza in the oven so it would be fresh and hot for me to take home). They use a 2000 degree oven so it only takes about a minute-90 seconds to cook."}
{"text":"I love Blaze's gluten-free pizzas and have been frequenting their restaurants for many years. However, I recently had two experiences with the restaurant manager at this N. Scottsdale location. 

The first was while quietly enjoying my pizza with my service animal at my side. Unfortunately, their employees harassed me and threatened to contact security to have me removed. They did not understand that a service animal did not need to wear a vest or be with a blind person. Their COO apologized that their employees did not know ADA law and gave me several free coupons to make up for their poor behavior.

I mistakenly returned to their restaurant to use one of these free coupons and this same manager was present. 

Once I left the restaurant, I was met with a security guard who told me that this manager (falsely) stated that I had been yelling, threatening, and using profanity towards one of their minor employees. This is an extremely disturbing and a very serious accusation.

Unfortunately, their corporate office sees it as a \"coaching\" opportunity.

I'd say stay away until they relocate or fire this restaurant's very angry and aggressive manager, Heather."}
{"text":"Unlimited toppings at a flat price? Uh yes please! This place is AMAZING. I went with my partner and we ordered one \"build your own\" pizza with all the toppings we enjoy on a pizza. They also let us do half half and half. You can also do substitutions on the menu pizzas. The pizza itself is pretty good. Thin crust, not too greasy and definitely filling enough for two people. They even have also gluten free option! Love this place. Highly recommended. Get the blood orange lemonade to accompany your delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time and I really enjoyed it. The pizza was a solid 8/10 but it was truly the kindness and smiles on the employees faces that made it so awesome. The staff was so nice and accommodating. Not to mention I love how they don't charge for ranch to dip the pizza in haha."}
{"text":"Love blaze to death but there is nothing blaze about it. These workers are beyond slow. The rating is purely on the service not the pizza. Dedicate at least half an hour to get your pizza.....this is not a \"blazing fast place\"!"}
{"text":"This visit to a Blaze'd was much better than my first one to the location in Centennial. This time the crust was perfect. I'm never gonna lose weight, haha! As far as local scene goes, Blaze'd really puts the competition on 800 Degrees. I wish the company would build a location in Summerlin. They would put Pieology out of business"}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I have eaten.  Being plant based, I look for vegan cheese and fresh vegetables and seasonings.  The crust was thin and they had an option for spicy red sauce.  The staff are courteous and even ask if the portion they put on your build to own pizza is ok.  Pizza was ready within minutes and the whole family enjoyed it.  Consider it in the weekly rotation!"}
{"text":"Fantastically fast, speedy, friendly and fresh.  Couldn't ask for a better lunch hang out atmosphere."}
{"text":"Greeted with a friendly \"hello\" when I walked through the door. The woman who started my order was very patient and explained how the whole Blaze process works as I had never been there before. The pizza was hot and delicious! Everything was so fresh and the crust was thin and had a nice crisp. The manager, Greg, stopped by to see how our meal was and was also very friendly! Great experience! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Gluten free crust was good. A lot of variety to make your custom pizza perfect. 
Extremely great customer service. They train their team right!"}
{"text":"My Husbandman and I eat here often. Great service, vegan options. The boxer/cutter Mike always gets my order right... he's awesome... app is the girl with the dreads...they always make my order perfect. The whole team is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"The service is good. The staff is friendly. I get the Red Vine with spinach and a balsamic glaze so I have to say all in all the pizza is a 9/10.  Honestly, what makes this better is the service.  We went there last night with a BOGO and my BOGO was a to-go for my work lunch and he made me a brand new one because he thought the original one was too burned!  Service goes a long way and this place kills it!"}
{"text":"Was super excited to find out Arizona had Blaze Pizza. Rushed over as they were closing in half hour. Ordered Veg Out with vegan cheese, zucchini, mushrooms, red onion, mozzarella, gorgonzola, red sauce dollops and I added artichokes & garlic, drizzled with olive oil. So good. Loved their customer service too. The guys were super friendly & professional. And don't forget to try their strawberry lemonade or mango lemonade, both very refreshing."}
{"text":"Am not a fan - pizza had a chemical taste like bleach! The rest of my party did eat all of their pizzas with no complaints . The staff is very kind and friendly. My pizza pan was wet on the bottom and the pie pans were just brought out from back so perhaps mine still has some cleaning residue. Not sure if I'll try it again!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place for family members who all want something different on their pizza. The price is competitive to fast food places, so this is definitely a better choice. 

Last night I built my own pizza with white sauce, turkey meatballs, basil, artichokes, tomatoes, goat cheese, Gorgonzola and a ton of other veggies. If you want something different than a traditional mozzarella & pepperoni pizza, I recommend this combo .

Once you choose your toppings they fire it up and your pizza is fresh from the oven. Yum!"}
{"text":"Uuuughh where do I begin with this place?!.. The employees.., pizza..., the S'MORES PIES!?.. All SO AWESOME, the food is delicious, and the prices taste even better! Was bummed about scholtszkis being taken out until I had this place. Now I wish Blaze would have been there the whole time! It's like the chipotle, Ghangas Grill, or capriottis of Pizza. Definitely try this place out if you're in the area. Even if you don't like pizza try it out , this place just may change your perception."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in town! My husband and I love Blaze. They have great gluten free crust and we always get the spicy red sauce. We load on chicken and veggies and have never been disappointed. We've tried a lot of pizza restaurants and have never been satisfied. The service is friendly and fast and the price is very reasonable for what you get. Highly recommend Blaze."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night. Pizza was good, I do wish they cooked it before you got there if you order online but service was friendly and food was good. Will be back."}
{"text":"update to my review.  we went back to blaze and had a great meal.  the guys making the pizzas were very friendly and fast.  i will come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, even though it was a log line I got my food so fast and it tasted amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Kids enjoyed their cheese and pepperoni pizza. Hubby and I had bacon, ham, pineapple, roasted garlic, artichokes and red onions. We both liked the crispy thin crust. Make sure to try the Blood Orange Lemonade. It's perfect blend of sweet and  tart."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza place that is fast on service, and food delivery  while retaining the same quality. 

The best part about this establishment is that I always get build your own pizza as you can put as many toppings as the dough can hold. You can experiment with ingredients of your choice which can make people come back for more to try new things. It may be heavy for being able to finish a whole serving, so a lightweight eater can easily pack some of it and save it for a snack. I've been here more than 4 visits and I will keep coming back for more. 

The lineup for peak hours (lunch hours) can be a downer for some, but there is an app you can download to order ahead and pick it up."}
{"text":"I had the build your own pizza and it was delicious! There was not too much burnt part on it. I like it when there is less char on the crust. The service for putting the toppings on the pizza was a bit strange because somehow we skipped putting the meats on there until the end. The pineapple and zucchini was juicy and the meats (ham, pepperoni, and chicken) were tasty.

One of a number of custom-built pizza places in the area.  I also had one with spicy red-sauce, mozzarella cheese and a few meat toppings.  All in all I'd say it was delicious, but I'm not sure it's better or worse than the competition."}
{"text":"First time going, have always heard good things about it. It was a little tough to understand the first employee but eventually we worked thru it. Think Chipotle style. After we picked our ingredients and paid, our name was called within 5 minutes. Pizza was delicious, great size for me. She had some left over but ate the rest later on. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I called to order the Green Stripe with Gluten-free crust.  I was told I needed to order online or in person,  no ordering over the phone.  Ok fine,  so I hung up and joined the new generation and in 2 minutes placed my online order.  I paid online,  this place doesn't deliver and I came over to pick up my order at the time on my receipt. My pizza wasn't ready and I was told to wait,  and wait 20 minutes later, finally they called my number and i went home with my box. 

My Green Stripe was anything but green it was missing the pesto and arugula!!! And it wasn't gluten free.  I paid extra for gluten free.  As in no gluten. 

I was home,  with pizza that was less than what I payed for or called to order.  And I can't eat gluten! 

This is what happens when you remove the human element,  and \"streamline\"  your business with computer ordering.  I called back to complain and the person on the phone said nothing can be done, unless I  return to the store. I explained that the pizza I was sold was inedible and I needed a refund. Nope,  no can do I was told. 

But I was home,  not wanting to go pick up another pizza, I was in the comfort of my own home."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place. I love the Chipotle like concept of building your pizza and the staff was friendly. The gluten free pizza was delicious and my family had the original crust that they loved too. We unfortunately didn't have any left overs because it was that good."}
{"text":"Tried to online order and it wasn't working. Tried to call and place an order over phone and they said that I couldn't do that. So I guess they don't want any business. Oh well."}
{"text":"We loved their location in Encinitas, Ca and were so thrilled they were coming to the Mesa/Phoenix area.  Love the crust, love the customization and love love love the interaction with the pizza makers."}
{"text":"I love getting pizza from here ! I like white sauce pizza and my girlfriend likes red sauce pizza so we both get what we want for an affordable price. The goat cheese and berry salad is super yummy as well ! I love this place !!!"}
{"text":"Well just tried the competitor (Pizza Rev) and OMG, that was horrible.  I have had better pizza from Chuck E. Cheese.  The crust was the same as CEC, you can have a heart-attack just from the amount of cheese they smother it with, Blaze has more topping choices, and the pizza crust (most were deformed, not completely round). 

Blaze, you have no competition !"}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is one of my favorite places! If you haven't tried their fruit salad, it's a must! Their customer service, tasty fast fired pizza and lemonade is what keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"the pizza is really good but the service is subpar. on a 1-10 scale id give pizza a 10 and service a 3. we placed an order for pick up for five pizzas, a smores cookie, and asked for red pepper flakes and parm. everything was ok besides the fact that they forgot to cut my friends pizza chicago style, forgot our red pepper flakes and parm and forgot the cookie smore. we even used caps lock. step your service game up"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a Blaze Pizza location. It is the same build your own pizza concept as Pizza Rev and Pieology where you go down a assembly line of employees to tell them the toppings you want on your pizza or you can opt in for one of their specialty pizzas. Then you wait 5-10 minutes for your pizza to be ready.

What sets them apart from their competitors is that you get a slightly larger pizza along with a thicker crust which makes for a better tasting pizza. Also, they offer different types of lemonades along with soda which is great for people who don't drink sodas."}
{"text":"Fresh toppings, and fast and friendly service is pretty much is why I suggest this place and also the fact that there is not good pizza places around. Just Wish the have more of a beer variation."}
{"text":"Pizza was good service was bad, they flipped my pizza in the oven and said they would make another. I waited 20 mins and no pizza. When I went to ask they said they forgot. The manager came by and apologized so that's reason why I'm giving them 3 stars. Pizza was amazing service was bad"}
{"text":"Fire blaze pizza..

Great food.
Great customer service.
Great atmosphere!
Reasonably price individual pizzas.

I will be back!

Was there Tuesday  evening.  About 9:30pm.
The young employees provide us with Excellent service."}
{"text":"Ate here from the first time last night. The food is fantastic and the service is too. Of particular note, the guy cleaning the dining room area was incredibly polite and on the spot picking up after people, I think his name was Jamand, he deserves a raise for being so conscientious."}
{"text":"I stopped by a day after they opened. It looks like the other location in town. I was greeted and asked what would I like. I ordered. I can tell the staff were cautious with making the pizza as not to mess up. I went to pay. The app wouldn't scan for me to get a flame reward. They promptly gave me a code so I could get it. I spoke with one manager and he told me the 1st day went well.  I think they will do well at this location."}
{"text":"I went as a new customer on Pi Day....

Had a minimum wait. My 3 stars are not for the food, it's for the customer service I received.

4.5 stars for the pizza! I made it!!! (In my Shirley Ceasar voice)

I already had the app on my phone, so I was prepared to obtain my free drink and record my entry of purchase.

Somehow, it didn't scan but I didn't notice until after I left. I called and talked to the manager Jimmy, and I felt almost scolded that I didn't ask for a receipt because that's how it works to get it fixed. I didn't know that. I'm a new customer remember??? He told me to come by tomorrow to see the GM.

 I did go back to the restaurant the next day to see the GM and I told him (GM WILKINSON) about what happened and he told me to contact customer service. He was very standoffish and didn't really want to help me, even rushed me to tell him why I was there and assumed I just wanted free food. He just referred me to contact customer service to fix any issues that I had.

That didn't make me feel good as being a new customer, and I'm not aware of how things happen at the restaurant. I did not scan my free drink and my purchase at the same time. I did that separately, and the cashier did say that it took when I asked her. I also could not put the pie code I was given in on the app because it would not allow me to (to use on a future visit). I mentioned that to the general manager as well, and he still directed me to let customer service handle it.

 I was not impressed with his customer service skills even though I know it was a busy time, but that's when the manager Jimmy told me to come and speak with the GM because he would be available.

I'm still waiting to hear back from customer service. 

I may go back again because the food was good."}
{"text":"Went to this location for the free pizza promotion. The line was surprisingly not too long and moved quickly. This location actually included a decent amount of each topping, unlike a few of the other locations I've visited. All the employees were friendly, but you could tell a few of them were flustered by the number of people coming through. This is definitely the best of the locations I've visited in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"I choose a BYO. I have been to other Blaze Pizza's so I knew it would be good. You basically either build your own for 11.95 or order one of their creations. I usually order their meat lovers exclude the onions easier when it comes choosing from their great selection of ingredients. The pizza is in point thin, crispy dough. 
Salad:I tried the quinoa salad for the first time. I wasn't to find of it. The ingredients are great but the dressing has a spice that his a bit too strong foe my palate like cumin or something...not for me only reason I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Blaze on Central after grabbing a spot across the street to watch the APS Light Parade. It was the first time I'd been to a Blaze shop. The place was just starting to get hopping and only got busier as the night went on. When we got there our wait wasn't too long to order but the kids did seem just a tad unorganized, but given that it was setting up to be a ridiculously busy night for them it's pretty understandable. Once ordered, our pizzas took a little under 10 minutes overall, if that to be done. I decided on the Green Stripe pie, which consists of a pesto drizzle over grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, chopped garlic, mozzarella, arugula. It's a thin crust affair that's really pretty tasty and fit the bill perfectly. While I did enjoy the food, I'll reserve more judgment on Blaze until I make further visits. There are other similar pizza options in town that, so far, I find produce a better pie. So, overall, there was nothing glaringly disappointing about Blaze and you could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always fresh and tasty. Workers are all nice and sweet. Best pizza in town"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Blaze and it was awesome!! The food was delicious and our dining room attendant Brooks was amazing!!! He was so helpful and genuinely nice. I'll definitely be coming back because of him."}
{"text":"This place is just slow. If you want to wait 30 minutes in line go here.  While your in line you can also watch all their online orders go first before they start on your order. The staff try their best but they don't even understand the ingredients they are working with. I ordered artichokes with my pizza only to watched in amazement as the guy was picking the leaves to put on the pizza and throwing away the base of the artichoke. I gave one star for a tasty pizza. Will not be coming back. Too many good restaurants close by."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant a week ago and we had company in town and decided to try it out.  I am glad we did.  Service was fast and the girls that made my pizza were helpful and really nice.   Our pizza was ready for us in about 3 minutes.  I was very impressed with their pizza.  I thought it was delicious.  I had the art lovers with the sauce on first and then they added a little sea salt which took it over the top.  I am so happy that this restaurant has opened up on this side of town.  We will definitely be dining here again."}
{"text":"The assistant manager Luke was great in helping with our fundraiser Thanks to all the staff at Blaze"}
{"text":"What can possibly go wrong? If you order the build your own, you can get anything on it without an additional price and you can ask for extras of each topping . Customization to the max. The quality of food is also bomb with a great thin crust. I always add pesto to the crust too to give it an extra boost in taste. They accept card so that's a plus and depending on the time of day you go, it's not that busy!"}
{"text":"Ok talking about quick blazing pizza!!! This is the spot great pizza with all the toppings. You also have some other things to choose from but MAN this pizza is AMAZING!!! Definitely need to check it out!"}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is so yummy yummy!!! It's my new favorite pizza joint.  They have signature pizza but my favorite is the BYO pizza !!!!! It's like Burger King and subway you can have it your way they have so many toppings and sauce.  My favorite sauces to get is the white sauce. So definitely check it out if you have one near you or not make the trip it's worth it."}
{"text":"This pizza place is AMAZING! Been here twice already. There are \"preset\" pizzas you get from the menu which already have all the toppings chosen for you put I prefer the build your own. The build your own pizzas are the same price as the pizzas on their menu but you can customize it however you wish with unlimited toppings. 

I usually get mine half classic read and half white cream sauce since you can't really get that anywhere else. From there, you're free to put as many or as little meat/veggies on there as you want. After they cook the pizza, you can put on herbs/spices or arugula for flavour. 

Another thing to note in that their crust is super thin so you actually can enjoy the flavour of the pizza and not eating pure dough. LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Super fast, make it how you want it.  What more could you ask for in a pizza place.  

Great concept & great food. My only complaint is that I wish I would've thought of it!"}
{"text":"The pizza in this place is better than PIZZA PIZZA. One pizza is big enough for two girls. It's crispy and fresh. I got a Deluxe Hawaii pizza:)  I chose double mozzarella ham bacon chicken pineapple olive onions. This combination matches each other so nice! Will be back again."}
{"text":"I discovered this place in january and love it. The food is all natural (not organic though) they have great tasting gluten free crust and vegan cheese. Its set up like subway or chipotle where they prepare it in front of you. If you have allergies they will change their gloves to prepare your food. The only issue i have is that they dip their hands into meat, dairy and veggies, creating a cross contamination and they cut all the pizzas with the same cutters so ive had a stomach ache a few times most likely due to this. The staff is usually really friendly. You can order online and you can sign up for their rewards program too. The food is super cheap! $8-10 for a pizza. I can usually eat one by myself but ive been to other places where a gluten free pizza with vegan cheese (same size) was $25 and didnt taste even close to this good! They also have an unlimited topping option which is awesome because they have great toppings! They have unique flavored drinks available too. Highly recommend it esp if youre looking for gluten free and/or vegan pizza!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Price is the same no matter how many toppings you chose. You can chose from their signature menu or make your own."}
{"text":"Ok, here we go...

Good pizza.  Seriously good pizza, fresh ingredients, freshly-made dough.  It's all good.

I like all the options available here.  The pies are already cheap as it is, but Blaze has lower prices for a one topping pizza or a simple pie (cheese and sauce).  They also have one-, two- or three-portion salads so that everyone can get exactly how much they want.

I got the Link In pizza with bacon, basil, roasted garlic and mushrooms added.  Delicious.  I that garlic gave the pizza some roasty, toasty sweet richness.  What I live for is the basil!  So good.  Nicely roasted red peppers and sausage bring the flavor.

Friendly staff, even when it's on & poppin like today.  I'd definitely come back for another pie."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service! Quality control is a must for them. My pizza came out with a small hole in the center. They asked me if that was okay. I said of course & the manager gave me a coupon for a bogo. The pizza that came off after mine had too much charring & he required it be remade. I had the build your own with white sauce, mozzarella & goat cheese, chicken, fresh basil, spinach, roasted garlic & roasted red peppers, topped off with pesto drizzle. Delicious!"}
{"text":"chipotle for pizza.
came on saturday for lunch, everything moved very efficiently and quickly. All of the employees were very friendly and my pizza was really good. The crust is awesome and its a very quick wait despite the pizzas being made fresh to order. Also, the prices were very good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Pizza is good, and customer service is good too. Prices are reasonable for what you get. The only downside, which probably doesn't seem like a downside to everyone, the pizzas are all one size. I have a big appetite, so a larger portion would be great, but overall great experience."}
{"text":"Pizza was very tasty. Three stars off are for the employees who apparently don't care about their customers and communicate horribly. 
I called in a order for pickup and they had not even started on it until I arrived. This is pitiful considering it took me 20 min to arrive to the place. I had to ask for an employees attention at least 3 times. 

Blaze manager: please get it together with your employees or I won't be back."}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza is easily one of my favorite places to eat. I love the white sauce they offer instead of the usual tomato sauce on pizzas. I also love that I can load up as many veggies I want for no additional charge. In addition to their yummy pizzas they have fresh salads which are super good. They also have little smores and cookies which are delicious. For under $10 you can't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"The final product was perfect. Their pizza is amazing. I love their white sauce option since marinara gives me heartburn. However, for a place that wasn't busy when we arrived, the service was extremely slow and the counter with all the topping options was incredibly messy. There was food everywhere. I would perhaps just trying looking for an alternate location maybe?"}
{"text":"I live near this place so I've come here quite a few times already and had mostly good experience. The idea of having an ingredient buffet and letting the customers customize their own pizzas is brilliant. The pizzas prices range from $5.95 to $7.65 from the most classic pizza to the most deluxe with all toppings you can think of. The ingredients are fresh and the service is good. The only negative thing about this place is that the line is usually pretty long so if you're coming here to get pizza, be prepared to wait in line for some time."}
{"text":"This is my new pizza place. I love adding all of the ingredients for one price. It takes about 3-5 minutes to cook your pizza. It's just like going to Chipotle, you order what sauce you want and move along and you tell them what meats/vegetables/cheese you want on your pizza. The pizza is original crust and it taste good.The service is great and the atmosphere is great as well. It's spacious in there, lots of room to sit if you have 2-10 people. You can dine in or take out."}
{"text":"The fact that you can put unlimited toppings on your pizza and customize it to your liking for the same price is the best! Each pizza is about $8 bucks and about the size of a small pizza. They do however only serve one size, but that's fine with me. I always get full and end up leaving half the pizza for later or the next day. It taste great! At least the ones I create to my liking taste good! Lol And you can't beat the price for what you get! They also sell warm s'mores for dessert. So good! And their lemonade selection is pretty good as well if your not trying to drink soda. They once accidentally burnt my crust and offered to make me a new one at no extra cost which is great customer service. I honesty like this place better than their competitors. Try it out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time there and I thought the pizza was great. It was just the right portion and I love the variety. I had the Red Wine pizza and blood orange drink. The only issue was the screaming when your order is ready. Opportunity for improvement"}
{"text":"Such a great deal! You get to fully customize a personal pizza for yourself. Essentially a Subway but for pizza. The staff was really helpful and friendly. They explained the process/concept to me and made the experience easy. I can't event remember what topping I put on but it was a lot. There is a great selection of toppings and it pops out of the oven in no time. I would highly recommend this place to anyone really."}
{"text":"Friendly, clean, and great food! The price and quality of food is awesome! You can put unlimited toppings at no additional charge. The atmosphere is very laid back, this place would be great for groups!"}
{"text":"Ok.....I've been here several times now and I wrote that they have too many employees on staff.  Well, I found out why one night.  I walked in and (thank god I called ahead) the place was packed.  I mean \"people out the door\" packed.  The only thing that irritated me about when you order on the internet is that they make the pizza but they don't cook it till you get there.  On a night so busy I had to get someone's attention to cook the pizza as the cashier wasn't paying attention to me at all and there was only one of them for some reason.  Now I get that they don't want the pizza cold when you pick it up....but it takes them 3 min to cook the pizza and I live 2 min away.  It took me 10 min to pick up my order.  Not cool."}
{"text":"Love this place! For a few dollars more than a delivery pizza, you can get a wood fire pizza with as many topping as you like! I love how customizable it is and the whole process is pretty fast too (only 10 ish mins to order and cook the pizza). Taste is also great and it's thin crust without being crunchy and dry. Definitely will come here again"}
{"text":"Been to several Blazes around the valley, all good.....really like this chain. However this one was a disappointment. Mostly just cause the staff.  Not very friendly and not well managed. I ordered a one topping pizza and they tried to charge an extra $1 cause I asked for some Parmesan along with the usual mozzarella. I mentioned this at the register and they reluctantly took it back off. Seriously guys? I mean, I hate to be picky, but it's literally just a sprinkle. What's next? You gonna charge me for a napkin and then a straw? Or maybe oregano? Oh I got a good idea, \"let's charge separately for the boxes!\""}
{"text":"Wow.. you guys nailed it.
basic pepperoni could not have been better
thank you"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food great atmosphere and the right price. I would love to own a franchise."}
{"text":"I got a 1 top pizza with grilled chicken. The pizza was ok, but overpriced for what I got. Mine came burnt. Also they didn't put much chicken on my pizza (approx 2 small pieces per slice). Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Line assembly thin crust pizza.  The crust was good. You decided the toppings, so if you don't like the flavors that is your fault.  Good quality toppings.

The crust it crispy and flakey, I found it to be very delicious.  

The price is steep for the amount of food you get, but within a range where I would possibly try it again.

Fun atmosphere.

Overall impression:  Fun for a date or a night out with the family, as long as you only have one kid."}
{"text":"I absolutely love BLAZE!

You can literally make any pizza you can think of for only $12!  The toppings are fresh and high quality I personally love the turkey meatballs, so flavourful and healthier than the other meat options there. They offer some more unique options that really elevate your pizza (think blue cheese, pesto sauce, roasted garlic, sauteed mushrooms etc.) the value is outstanding here in my opinion.

Must try, a lot better than any of the other options in the eaton centre area."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the visit, the pizza as well as the service was spectacular. I encourage you to check this place out and trust me you won't regret it. Everything was great. Let's face it, Chipotle ran away with this concept and if I had it in me I would call Mr. Blaze to franchise it to me. We don't have anyone doing pizza this way in my area(Northern Va/DC). 

Not only that the business model was genius but the pizza was really good, good job guys/girls and I recommend this place to anyone. By the way the prices will have your jaw drop as well. Go there!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally, a pizza you can make yourself without having to break the bank to have all the toppings you want.  Add any toppings - all one price $7.65.

Your 11\" personal pizza dough moves along (assembly line style) with staff adding your choice of various toppings along the way. They offer a variety of sauces, including a spicy red sauce. Most toppings you could want on a pizza are here at Blaze's. At the end, the pizza is put in a open gas fired oven that turns out pizza's in 3-4 minutes flat due to the blazing 180° temperature! You might need a little extra time if you have a lot of toppings on your pizza. Your finished product is a crispy thin personal pizza made your way.

For dessert, we had their S'more Pie. It is a s'more that is heated up near the hot oven when you are ready for dessert. The price is right at $2.00 per s'more.

Your also not robbed on fountain drinks here. Seems were ever I go these days, it is $3-$4 for your non alcoholic beverage. At Blaze they offer a great selection of fountain drinks including cherry-coke and two varieties of fresh lemonade options for $1.85.

The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly and pleasant - they greet you coming in and say good-bye on the way out. The owner passes by to do his satisfaction check as well.

I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious and the price is spot on. You can purchase beer or wine here for $5. The only downside I see is that these kids are busting their a** back there and when you get ready to pay Blaze does not have the system set up to allow you to tip on your credit card. Blaze owners you need to do something about this. These kids deserve more for all of the work they are putting in, especially on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"4 of us went there for the first time ever today. Two of the guys just split a pizza, they got half how one wanted and half as the other wanted. This is the way to go.
What you do is walk up to the counter, tell them what kind of crust (I got the regular and it was just right). Then tell them what kind of sauce or sauces (you can do half and half or mixed together or one kind) I got the spicy red. Pretty spicy. If you get it, make sure that you like spicy. Then you tell them which meats and which veggies. They then cook them in the oven for 3 minutes. Yes, only 3!! Short wait, and you eat. $8 before tax and this is for all the toppings you want on it. I also got a cookie for $2 and a brownie for $2. I'd say yes again to the brownie but not to the cookie. All in all, with such great happy faces, I'll definitely be back. By the way, each pizza is 6 slices. And 3 is enough for one adult so it was 2 meals worth."}
{"text":"Blaze customer service is as great as their pizzas!  We love them both.  After I ordered via their web app and realized I chose the wrong location John--(manager?)on duty at the time--recognized my frustration and really stepped up!  Instead of making me drive across town to pick up the (cold) pizza at the other location, John duplicated my order at no charge when the other location didn't answer when I called to straighten things out.  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Loved it! 

Simple concept. One price with no extra cost. Fresh ingredient great service. Loved it and will be back."}
{"text":"This place has still kept the standard high since the time I visited last. In fact they are a bit more efficient and fast at getting orders out. I noticed one of the veggie topping container had a meat piece. The employee was  more than happy to get me a fresh new veggie topping container to make up for that. Overall happy and will continue visiting this amazing pizza joint."}
{"text":"Just as good as pie-ology and project pie! It's the chipotle of pizza! U can choose from a group of pre-determined pies or completely build your own. For my order, I ordered the white top (huge fan of white sauce pizzas) and added pepperoni, ricotta, and Gorgonzola! Overall delicious; atmosphere is very casual, and there's outdoor seating for when the weather is beautiful."}
{"text":"Pizza is always a favorite.  This place was very busy with a bit of a line. Once in the queue, you move rapidly, either picking a special pizza off the menu or creating one of your own.  Your pizza is assembled right in front of you while it moves down the line.  The ingredients looked fresh.  At the end, the pizza is placed into the oven with the flames and baked very quickly.   I admit I had my doubts but the meat lovers pizza we ordered was very good.   I don't think this pizza place will become my favorite,  but it was a nice change and I would come back here."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza. Build your own or get a pre-selected pizza. Quick and cheap and yummy. Taste great. Local and cheaper than the pizza chains"}
{"text":"I have been to Blaze one time and probably only one time. The crust was not light and fresh like that of Mod pizza. The toppings were ok. If you are in a pinch and wanting quick pizza I guess this works, but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"What can I say other than Blaze Pizza N. Decatur is top shelf!  From the delicious pizza, salads, dessert, and Frescas to the OUTSTANDING customer service.  It took me a while to check Blaze out because the parking lot is a bit of a nightmare, but one afternoon I decided to take a chance and see if they lived up to the hype my good friend was giving me.  As soon as I walked in I heard a chorus of happy \"Hello and welcome to Blaze!!\", I immediately smiled.  When I approached the counter I was asked if I had been there before, to which I answered no and was then guided through the ordering and customization process.  I couldn't believe that I was being offered so much flavorful variety at such a low cost!  I was full of expectation as I waited (not very long) for my pizza to cook.  I was not disappointed, the first bite all the way through to the last bite was heaven!  Now that I have become a frequent customer (as much as 4 times a week at times) I know to slather my pie in garlic pesto before anything else, and I know that at any given time, someone on shift knows me (which makes me feel pretty special). Now it's time for shout outs to my Blaze family: Jon, my first friend, who remembered when I came in for lunch for my first visit and returned for dinner that same night with my mother in tow by saying \"Weren't you here earlier?\", Kenya who always greets me enthusiastically, along with Britney who greets me with a \"Hey girl!\", Cortland, Ricky, Elizabeth, Michael, Angela, Ana, Leshay, and Ms. Megan who says \"Hey Mama!\", there are others too (Sorry guys if I didn't name you!!) this staff is awesome and make the experience of coming in a double joy with their genuine good spirits and delicious food!  If you haven't tried it go immediately!!!!!  You can't beat the price for real food!  Thank you my Blaze family you have a devoted customer in me!!!!!"}
{"text":"Build your own pizza with unlimited toppings for $12.95 - it doesn't get better than this for pizza! 

The process to build your own pizza is pretty simple: 1. pick your dough, 2. pick the sauce (you can do half-half), 3. pick your cheeses, 4. pick your meats, and 5. pick your veggies. Then, you pay and wait for your pizza to be ready! Once it's ready, you can pick finishes like drizzles or sauces on top. 

For sauces, I highly recommend half classic red sauce and half pesto sauce. I recommend the goat, ricotta, and mozzarella cheeses. For veggies, anything really goes, but definitely recommend basil. As for meats, the meatballs and grilled chicken are yummy! I like finishing my pizza with pesto drizzle and balsamic glaze. 

The service here is EXTREMELY friendly and definitely makes the whole experience super fun/friendly! 

Note: If you can't finish your pizza, just ask for a pizza box! 

Tip: The more toppings you add, the harder it will be for the crust to fully cook through. But do it up!"}
{"text":"Tried this fun new fast fired pizza place... so cool! Very lively decor, peppy music with efficient and friendly customer service. 
You can build your own pizza with unlimited toppings for $8.25 or do a simple cheese pie for $5.50. One topping is $6.25 and 2 topping is $7.65.
They even serve beer $3  and wine $5.
The pizza is delicious, just tried the simple cheese pie. Fast fired and ready in less than 5 mins!
They have a thicker dough for an extra charge.
Fun dessert choices like s'mores pie and cookie brownie for just $2!"}
{"text":"Same basic concept as Fired Pie and Mod Pizza. Build your own pie with as many toppings as you like. The staff was very friendly and accommodating as my 4 yr old was deciding what she wanted. Pie takes maybe 5-8 minutes to get to you. The crust is thin and crispy but with good chew. Nice pizza for the cost but what sets them apart a little is the availability of their juice mixes. Things like mango-orange are available so that was nice. Would stop again if I needed a quick pizza fix!"}
{"text":"I just have to say... I am Impressed!
Blaze Pizza is an Awesome addition to Yonge & Dundas. I was here when it was an overpriced burger/diner joint and never came back. My bf and I ate here on a whim and we are definitely coming back. It's a simple franchise pizza joint and I wouldn't change a thing... well, except for my order so I can try other flavours.
Large clean space with lots of seating. Service was friendly, they explained the ordering process well and they actually come around to clean tables and check on customers.
Ordered make our own pizza:
- light on pizza sauce, bacon, pepperoni, mozzarella, spinach, basil, mushrooms and kalamata olives
- white sauce, artichokes, mushroom, meatball, spinach and goat cheese
Both excellent. Crust was crispy and ingredients were fresh. One would've been enough to share but we just had to have 2 :)
2 pizzas and 2 drinks came up to under $30. A very filling meal and very yummy!
Tip - although very tempting, don't overload the pizza if you want to keep it nice and crispy."}
{"text":"This place never lets me down. The pizza is amazing, fresh ingredients. Now the staff could take a few classes on customer service but nevertheless I love the selection, from the salads to the toppings to the pizza itself, all amazing ! The beverage selection is great also, not sure what they have to offer as far as alcohol since everyone there seems to appear pretty young. If you're attempting to go during lunch, get in there early."}
{"text":"So THIS is the place everyone has been calling the \"Chipotle of Pizza!\" 

Upon entering Blaze Fast Fire'd Pizza, I was hit with the most lovely pizza smell and I knew that I was in for a treat. The decore and atmosphere is quick casual, similar to that of Chipotle. We dined in and I wish it hadn't been so windy so that we could have dined out on the patio. 

If you're on a time crunch, be sure to snag a menu at the start of the line to get an idea of what toppings you may or may not want. There are a few standard pizza options for you to choose from or use as a base to your own creation. You have about 3 crust types to choose from and from there, no topping is off limits. 

I used their Red Vine as a base for mine and added pepperoni, turkey meatball and artichoke... it was SO GOOD! I loved that their crust was a little more crisp than what I was expecting (800 degrees type crust, a little dough-y). I want to clarify that the crust was perfect as I enjoy a little crunch. The toppings were all fresh and you can see that from the line. The cook time was no longer than 10 minutes, I want to say. 

Great place to check out if you're a pizza person like me. :)"}
{"text":"This place is the Chipotle of Pizza. For $13ish, you can get a pretty decent sized pizza with whatever toppings you want. You can load up on all the proteins, veggies, cheeses and etc. Theoretically your pizza could be a foot tall. From a service standpoint, all of the staff were very polite. The ingredients were fresh and the pizza was baked in a mere 180 seconds. All in all, a great experience and will be back again."}
{"text":"I've come to this location multiple times and never did I have such a horrible experience. When you can see huge spaces of sauce and the person in front of you has a pie full of cheese not to mention a decent amount of toppings and yours is slim to none and YOU are just saying for it then there's a clear difference being made. I don't appreciate how my pie turned out nor was cooked it was burnt. I regret even paying for it. Never again Blaze. Give customers what they pay for not what
You want to give them. I won't return it's not worth the hype."}
{"text":"Service was really fast and the pizza was delicious. The water cups are extremely small so they definitely need to go up a few sizes. The weather was great so u could without a doubt sit outside. Blaze gets 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Grand Opening! Quick, inexpensive, and delicious! Enormous amount of toppings to choose from. The setting feels open and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"It's literally the chipotle of pizza. Super fast, super tasty and super cheap. You basically order the same way you would at a subway or chiptole. You pick your sauce and toppings or the specialty pizzas and by the time you sit down it's already in front of you."}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza is delicious!  We purchased the BYO (build your own) option and it was delicious!  We should have shared 1 instead of purchasing 2.    

The only drawback is Blaze does have an upcharge for gluten-free crusts, the basil pesto, & a few other items.  It didn't make a huge difference for us, but I noted it.  A HUGE PLUS is Blaze offers VEGAN CHEESE!  

This location offered lemonade as well as blood orange lemonade - both flavors are delicious.  There was also an assortment of sodas.  All beverages are replenishable.  

Due to its location, tables were used and left sided frequently.  Staff wasn't cleaning and prepping the tables for new customers fast enough.  The staff is extremely pleasant and extended great customer service with a smile."}
{"text":"Blaze is a new modern and hip build your own pizza place. I loved the atmosphere and fresh style. When you first walk in you're greeted by friendly employees! I asked for the Vine speciality style pizza with added spinach and olives. It was really neat to see them put everything together. They offer delicious variations of tea and lemonade which were all very tasty. What I loved about blaze is their crust is crispy and the sausage on my pizza was so amazing! 

The entire time I sat there employees would check in to ask how everything was. What great customer service! They also have four peaks on tap and great craft bottled beer. This too was a pleasant surprise. I'd chose Blaze over MOD or Pieology anytime! Excited to see them branch out to other locations."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza at a reasonable price. I like the limitless customization and thin crust. The spicy red sauce is SO good! Adds a nice kick."}
{"text":"Really good for a not quite sit down not quite fast food pizza place !! It's pretty decently priced and fast when the line is short. Lemonade is pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"Great food. Red vine pizza was delicious. Ingredients all seemed very fresh and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"A must try pizza... Way Better than oven cook pizza! Pizza its really good!!! A lot of toppings to choose from also affordable price.... Staff is so friendly I hope they will keep it up!!!! Even it was so busy cause it grand opening people doing our pizza has the time to ask how we are doing which is great.. Service is also fast which is good!!!!!!!! I'm definitely gonna come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"So the pizza was good !! I still think Pizza Rev has a leg up !! Why I really want to share is that the service was slow and mediocre!! Everyone one was on the rude side except for the young lady that calls your name when your pizza is done !! 

I must also tell you that the place was on the dirty side !! I popped some photos of the vents and the sad part is this place is fairly new !! 

Two of the most important things are cleanliness and good service !! Now a days I settle for good service but would sill prefer great service !! But times have changed ...."}
{"text":"This place is great, I just have One complaint that has kept me from returning as often.
THE JALAPEÑOS AREN'T FRESH! 
Seems kind of odd to me when 90% of everything else offered seems to be fresh.  Please switch from pickled to fresh jalapeños!"}
{"text":"Got the red vine pizza. Only a short wait, people were friendly, pizza was very tasty. I will definitely come back for quick pizza."}
{"text":"Toppings are just good. But the pizzas are really really thick. So, for the price that I paid, I wouldn't know if I recommend this place. 
The employees seems zombies. They use same spoon for different uses. It's the 3 rd time I eat in Blaze's, first was in Chicago. Please take seriously customer service and cleansing. Restroom was awful. The salads that you offer, are beside the employee that take your order. Fully contaminated. Ovens can be cleaner as 

Updated 
I wanted to give another chance. 
Today  an employee called EZY explained me a few things I've asked. Got best pizza white top and more toppings. It was a great experience and the pizza delicious. The employees were better today. Will come back soon"}
{"text":"Came in over the weekend for a quick dinner.  Had a buy one get one free coupon. 

Pizza was ok but nothing great. The vibe of the place was a little off like staff wasn't really sure they wanted to be there. 

Good for a quick lunch at a decent price point."}
{"text":"Fave pizza place. Let them know it's your first time so the workers can explain how ordering works. It's essentially build your own pizza for one price! The ingredients are delicious! Always get a smore pie and ask for it to be warmed up. It's a yummy dessert. Great way to end the meal."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving this place 2 stars and not one is because the pizza here is really good and the ingredients are fresh. However, when we were on line watching the staff make our pizzas, one of their workers did NOT pull their long hair back.. and so her braids were dragging all over the pizzas (yes it was touching the food she was preparing). We talked to the manager immediately, to which he had her pull her hair back and work on other tasks. They offered to remake our pizzas so that was good, but HOW in the world did they not notice this?!? And how long was her hair touching people's food?? No idea, but that's a big health code violation. Gross."}
{"text":"I have been to plenty of pizza places but this one is indeed my Favorite!! I love the taste and how clean this place is . You get to create your own pizza . And the flavor is just beyond delicious .You must try this place out . You will not regret it !!"}
{"text":"Amazing fast great price never seems to fail. Customer service amazing. I've never left here dissatisfied always on point. Come her close to 2 times a week."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious. Staff is very friendly, would highly recommend! Bathrooms were also very clean and fresh, the facility is maintained well!"}
{"text":"5 stars for Blaze is a no-brainer!

The pizza is a thin crust and baked in an oven right in front of you. There are a lot of toppings to choose from (I need my cheese variety!!) so needless to say I was satisfied. You can also add different sauces after its baked like BBQ or Balsamic Glaze. It is usually busy so don't be surprised to wait in line but all in all totally worth it."}
{"text":"Every time I get a pizza here it is fresh, well prepared and very tasty.  Blaze offers a great value for the money and is our number one place for take out pizza."}
{"text":"They have my pizza to the wrong person and tried to give it to me after it had been touched by the other customer. 
Had to tell the lady that they have to make me a new pizza since that's gross, I don't know what this person has on her hands. 
Never coming back. 

And on top of it the guy cutting the pizza is unhappy that he has that job to do."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had since living in NC, I first had Blaze at a Yelp event where the restaurant closed for our private event and we enjoyed pizza, salad, dessert and beverages. 
I returned with my family shortly thereafter to enjoy this new found awesomeness. The restaurant is nestled on the corner of Camden across the tracks. There is nice outdoor seating and a intimate indoor seating section with sorta like communal tables.
The staff here is so nice they are very welcoming upon entering they greet you with a smile and someone is ready immediately to assist you in placing your order. The fact that you can get unlimited items on your pizza for one price is so AWESOME and the fact that the ingredients are so fresh and flavorful are icing on the PIE :-)

My last stop on the pizza train to completion is the SMORE, you must ask them to warm your smore which is done by placing it on the ledge in front of the brick oven Mmm Mmmm Good.

Overall as I said The Best Pizza I've had since living in NC.. My only caveat is the cleanliness of the dining area. It's NEVER clean EVER I always have to grab napkins and clean the seats and the table before we sit. 

Go Get Blazed & if dining in be ready to wipe your seat and table."}
{"text":"First off, if you have never been to Blaze stop reading this review and JUST GO!! Eat the pizza and then read more reviews. All you need to know is that this pizza is fresh, delicious, and you have to have it!!

I love pizza so it is rare for me to find a pizza place I don't like. Here are the pro's of this store: 

1. It is fast and fresh
2. You can choose AS MANY TOPPINGS AS YOU WANT!! All for the same low price I might add. 
3. Pizza's cooked in a fire pizza oven (I'm sure there is a more technical name for it) and are always delicious. 

I personally love white sauce pizza and it is delicious here. I usually just go for mozzarella and some feta, but the gorgonzola it tasty too. You can never go wrong with extra meet and veggies. I have friends that get the BBQ chicken pizza and say it's worth it! Now I know having the option to put as many toppings as you would like on your pizza is tempting, but you have to fight the urge the first (or second or third) time you go. Just go multiple times and try new creations and combos! Too many toppings = messy falling apart pizza. Also, the blood orange lemonade is great. I usually get water everywhere I go (to be cheap) but it is worth it to splurge and get the lemonade. I have even combined some of the lemonades!

The place can get busy! We went the other day and the line was wrapped all the way down to the drink machine. Still, the wait was maybe 10 minutes, so still faster than a sit down restaurant. The workers are always friendly! Just do yourself a favor and go here for lunch or dinner today. You will be satisfied for sure!"}
{"text":"New location in the northwest! The pizza is outstanding! You can build your own or u can choose one of their pizzas off the menu. We stuck with the menu for our first trip. He ingredients were fresh and he crust was great! The pizzas were done quickly. We got a bare pizza for the kiddos, a white top and a BBQ chicken pizza. I didn't sample he bare pizza, but the kids loved it. The white top and the BBQ chicken were great! I can't wait to go back & try some other flavors!


The staff was very friendly and polite. I know it's opening weekend so everyone was excited and trying hard, but I can't imagine their customer service will go down. The music was a little loud inside, but I enjoyed the environment. Can't wait to go back. If you are in the north west give it a try!"}
{"text":"Blaze is fast food, without feeling or tasting like fast food. At the time of writing, one of their thin crust pizzas with unlimited toppings  runs for $11. It's a little pricey for a personal sized pizza that you have to order and bring from a counter, but it's fired up in a matter of minutes, has unlimited toppings, and nice crispy crust.

 I've had some disappointing experiences at Via Vai and Mercato recently, with overly charred pizzas and spotty sauce, so I appreciate Blaze's consistency even though the raw dough looks like it came out of a machine. 

I only have two complaints really : the roasted garlic was undercooked, and the guy at the counter will not save you from yourself. Every time he said \"anything else?\" my greedy belly only thought \"I can have more!?\" Just know that too many wet toppings and cheese will cause a soggy pizza and the toppings in the middle will pool together in an oily mess.

{"text":"I work right down the street and tried Blaze out for lunch the other day. It's good thin crust pizza cooked quick with quality ingredients. Friendly staff, you can customize the pie exactly how you want it, and the prices are great. I can see why there are more and more of these opening up around the country. I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Marvelous pizza! I had a make your own pizza with goat cheese basil and meatballs pepperoni and olives and it was D Lish us! For around $8.50 this is a steal of a bargain and the food is oh so piping hot and good. They also have an order online option which I plan on using in the future. I did not see beer or wine yet but it said coming soon so I will return!"}
{"text":"Pizza is one of my favorite food groups and the pizza served here did not disappoint!!! 

The sauce, the cheese, the crust and the toppings were perfect!  I love that you can choose your sauce, either white, spicy tomato, or original tomato sauce.  I chose pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, ricotta, mozzarella and original sauce.   The only thing I would suggest is perhaps brushing olive oil or a healthier option than the canned spray they were using. 

Once your creation goes in the open oven, your wait is short which I was happy about because I could not wait to dig in.   

It was as delicious as it smelled right up to the last bite.  I will say the only thing I will request on my next visit is for the pizza to be left in the oven for about 3 minutes longer only because I would like the veggies on top to be browned a little bit more, but other than that it was perfect!  

The topping selections are awesome and I love that they are not at an extra cost, which allows you to try different pizza creations without indecision. 

For dessert I ordered their s'mores.  The cookie they use for their s'mores is not your typical graham cracker, but was better along with the gooey marshmallow and chocolate center Mmmm perfect.  They placed it in the oven and this ended the perfect dining experience.  

The place itself is very nice, clean and welcoming with both indoor and outdoor dining options.   The service was a bit spotty so I look forward to checking out some of their other locations to compare.    Great pizza and good looking salads which I will try next time!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Blaze pizza after seeing reviews on Yelp and passing by it a few times on my way to the Eaton Centre. I love the BYOP for one set price idea and it definitely works. I ordered my pizza online and went to pick it up which was much easier during the lunch rush. I did notice that the line moves pretty efficiently though. Everyone working there was super nice even though they were so busy. I walked up to the cash upon arrival as instructed to for online orders. I told her my name, they put my pizza in the queue for the oven, I paid for my order, and waited for my name to be called. Pretty neat to watch all the different personalized pizzas flying out of the oven as you wait.

As for the pizza, I went with..

Sauce -  Spicy Red Sauce
Cheese - Ovallini Mozzarella, Goat Cheese
Meat - Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Applewood Bacon and Turkey Meatballs
Veggies - Red Onions, Cherry Tomatoes and Roasted Red Peppers
Finishes - Arugula and Pesto Drizzle

I thought it turned out great except the crust was a bit soggy in the middle. I think this could be a toppings issue, but they did a good job of dispersing everything proportionately. My friend thought the spicy red sauce was spicy, but as a lover of spice I have to disagree so I added red pepper flakes to mine. This pizza is more than enough for one person and I could easily split it with one other person. I will definitely return and try another combination of toppings because the possibilities are endless. 

I am so glad they expanded into Canada and hope they continue to do so and we will see more locations in the future!"}
{"text":"This is my second experience at a pizza restaurant like Blaze with the whole \"three minute pizza\" shtick. My first experience was in DC and I loved it, but I gotta say, this was even better. 

I was able to try a bunch of things my first time at Blaze! Going through the line to select your ingredients for your pizza, they've got everything laid out nice and neat and labeled so you're not holding up the line while you're going through. Big help!

I got a side Caesar and the meat lovers pizza with spinach. They have like four different types of salads and they actually all looked really good. The Caesar was delicious! The dressing was perfect and the lettuce was crisp AF. Don't sleep on the side Caesar. 

The meat lovers pizza after coming out of the oven looked GREAT. Very pretty and taster just as good as it looked! The crust was crunchy on the outside and the meatball and pepperoni were spot on. You'd never know it was cooked in three minutes.

A couple other things to note: the service was top notch and the lemonades were DELICIOUS. Very happy people working as far as I could tell and there were four different lemonades - the blood orange was my favorite. 

If you're looking for a quick pizza and want something a little different from traditional places, I'd say this is a great place to try!"}
{"text":"First off haven't been to blaze in over a year. I took my dad and my nephews today for the first time and they loved it. Mind you I have a 80 yr old dad and 2 year old twins with me. The pizza was awesome my dad loved he could pick whatever he wanted and even stated it taste fresh and looks great. My nephews fed themselves and I was shocked they loved it. The staff was great and I will be back."}
{"text":"This pizza is great! Fast and delicious. The employees were all so nice and inviting. Loved the pizza so much came back the next day! 
I love that they have vegan cheese as an option. I've never seen that at other pizza places."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times I've had amazing service. Everyone is extremely friendly and nice. There are people walking around asking if you need anything. Plus you can make your own pizza with as many toppings aw you want for under $8."}
{"text":"Food is ok. The shenanigans and horse play is what happens when you let kids run a business. Been there a few times, seen a manager being pushed around while in an empty cardboard box. Tonight, tall skinny kid slapping the arms of a girl coworker who was making our pizza. We asked for a larger cup because we bought a bai drink and wanted to drink it to go. Was told they have to charge me $2.50. After i just spent $30 they want to charge me for an empty cup. So, there are a lot of these places opening in the area. Will stay with Midici and Fired Pie from now on. Same type of food, with adults running it."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of pizza, and when I was driving down the road on my way home and noticed a brand new pizza place, I knew I had to go. I told my wife, and a few days later on Saturday we stopped here for lunch while we were out running errands.

I had the White Top, and my wife had a standard pepperoni.

The White Top was really good! I would definitely order again. The sauce was good, and the toppings were good. I really liked the texture and doneness of the crust. I typically order my pizzas well done to get a bit more crispiness on the crust, but that wasn't necessary with these pizzas. The crust is also right between what a chain pizza place would consider thin and \"regular\" or \"hand tossed\". I really liked the crust all around.

My wife had a similar opinion of her pizza. The toppings were good, the standard pizza sauce was good, the crust was good. 

The one problem we both had was that there isn't enough cheese. I like extra cheese typically, but my wife absolutely does not. Even for her, when she just prefers regular amounts of cheese, there was not nearly enough cheese on these pizzas.

I will absolutely be back to this place. It was clear that they had just opened and were training their staff (either they were training, or they were hugely over-staffed), and even though they were training the staff was great and I had no issues."}
{"text":"Me my son and husband were so excited to try this place the wait was kind of annoying but they were busy so it was okay food was great when we were sitting down we didn't see any high chairs for my son so we sat him in the seat which he is a little to small but we had to do what we had to do? until this wonderful employee named POOH approached us immediately asked if we wanted a high chair , or any condiments. She brought us a high chair and asked if we needed anything we didn't have napkins Etc her customer service was amazing!!! I WILL RETURN HERE!!! Thanks Blaze and Pooh!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. The pizza options are so great especially when you have people who prefer very different types of pizza. The crust is super thin and chewy and the spicy sauce had tons of flavor. I will be going back. 

Only one suggestion. The staff was friendly but a little unprofessional."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever I would recommend this place to anyone the pizza is always fresh and the lemonade is amazing they make your pizza right in front of you! I hate the parking but everything is heaven in a box!"}
{"text":"Still like the concept and the pizzas are good tasting, however call ahead since they do tend to run out of toppings.   I don't get this though, you are a pizza place and you ran out of pepperoni?  Another location ran out of tomatoes and basil.  So just call ahead if you are looking for a particular topping.

Another turn off is some of the staff, and this is an ongoing concern at both locations I have visited, so it is not an isolated issue.  Most of the staff I feel needs more training in service and cleanliness.  The lady prepping our pizza had an apron that I believe was white at one point, but due to her constant whipping her hands on it to grab the next ingredient, her apron was disgusting.  I mean grab a towel or something.   They grab all the ingredients with just a wipe on the apron and it is a problem if you don't like blue cheese or didn't order crushed garlic.  The way they currently grab the ingredients, someone is going to get a mixture they didn't order.  

Again I still like the concept here and the quality, just wish the staff were a little more attentive and more knowledgeable at what they are doing. I don't think that just because a pizza can cost you under $10 bucks here this should hinder the service."}
{"text":"$7.95 for a build your own pizza unlimited toppings awesome deal. The white sauce is amazing so creamy doesn't take away from the flavor of the toppings. Great variety of topping choices. Friendly staff and the blood orange lemonade is to die for."}
{"text":"A chipotle-style build your own pizza place.  It's fun to do and great getting to pick all the moving parts of your own pizza.  Having it made in front of you is a bonus and it only take about 4 minutes to fire up and get sliced for consumption.
The pizza itself is pretty good and the service was excellent.  I hope to go back soon.
Recommendations: the spicy sauce adds a zest to the pizza I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Worse customer service. Walked out w/o ordering.  The pizza looked  atrocious & looked like frozen pizzas!! Awful looking atmosphere also."}
{"text":"The manager sent me two free coupons. I used them at a different location because there was no way that I was going to step foot in the Central Ave location again. Overall the experience was okay. They messed up both of our pizzas when they put regular cheese on mine even though I asked for vegan and they put gorgonzola on my fiancé's even though her pizza didn't call for it. The agua frescas were good and the pizza was tasty once made correctly. I'll never go back but I knew that going into it. My initial experience with the manager and crew at the Central location cemented my opinion of this place. I did appreciate the free coupons from the manager."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Great pizza! I got the build your own for $8.95, unlimited toppings! 
$5.00 Monday's! Any Pizza, Any Toppings! Valid until 5PM. *with purchase of any drink."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, salad was great. Ask for a receipt IF you need one because they wont email it to you later!  #expensereportproblems"}
{"text":"Very good pizza! 8.25 for unlimited topics on a small-medium pizza (probably more medium then small). They burnt my date's BBQ chicken pizza and immediately asked if we wanted them to make a second one, we said yes, the obliged and gave us free drinks as well. Fun and considerate staff! She couldn't wait to eat before I got pictures of both pizzas!"}
{"text":"I got the white top pizza and it was delicious!!! My kids all loved their pizzas. I love the way you can add ingredients to your personal pizza. Such a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Awesome value for what you pay for.  About $8 buys you a decent sized pizza with unlimited toppings.  They make your pizza in front of you.  I enjoy the personal touch of creating my own pizza.  Food is great and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza is fresh and always superb!! They use a wood fired oven that makes the crust amazing!! Please whatever you do make sure you get the blood orange drink.  Customer service is always great!"}
{"text":"I came during the opening and was given some buy one get one free coupons. The pizzas are around $8 and you get unlimited toppings. The toppings all looked fresh and they have a hell of a lot to choose from. I got the spicy sauce on my first visit and it wasn't very spicy but I liked it. The crust is super thin but crisp and the amount of toppings I had didn't weigh the pizza down or make it soggy after cooking. When I came back the last time I had the regular sauce and a couple different cheeses than the last time and it was very good. Workers were friendly and upbeat though they could turn the music down it was too loud. They have tables also outside where you can eat."}
{"text":"The food is always great, no doubt about that! Unfortunately the staff is not so great. The person who began our order ( I think her name is brandy) looked like she hated her life and had no want or desire to be there. Then we moved onto Eli and he was pretty nice until he learned there were no backups of the bacon and spinach. I understand being upset that someone hasn't done what was expected but he became visibly frustrated with Sam in front of other costumers. Having food industry expirence, I know how frustrating and embarrassing it is to be called out on the spot in front of all the other customers standing there. I think it was very unprofessional and unnecessary. You're a team, you should work as one."}
{"text":"This place is a real mess. I tried it twice and both times it's been a disaster.  The first time, they burned the pizza. Tonight, they ran out of half the ingredients. There will not be a third."}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly staff. They make good recommendations and even let you know when certain mixes might not be the best idea."}
{"text":"Staff are all very friendly, enthusiastic and helpful! And pizza was even better than I imagined! So quick and very generous with the toppings."}
{"text":"Right on Yonge Dundas Square! it was a saturday night and the line never stopped but it went by really fast. They need more seats and tables for sure.A waiter came buy to offer us water too.
 
We ordered two build your own pizzas. Mine had half spicy red and half classic red sauce, mozzarella, the chewy oval kind yum, smooth and creamy risotto, turkey meatball, chicken, bacon with sweet savoury hints, mushrooms, zucchini, spinach, and BBQ sauce! Fast build and very fast bake. Super delicious but mine was a little soggy near the centre.  I thought the cream sauce and pesto sauce didnt have enough flavour though. Each one was 11.95 I thought it was a good price for the portion given!!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place. I enjoy being able to have unlimited toppings. You definitely can get a lot for your money. The 3 stars is because the staff up front are usually stepping over each other and will go back and forth to taking your initial order to making your pizza all with the same glove. As you go down the line some of them actually like they're scared they are going to put too many toppings on it or something. They move so slow putting each piece of item on one by one. I don't know something about it irritates the crap out of me. Just put the toppings on already...geeesh! But other than that, great concept and decent quality of food too. Been there about 4 times already since I heard about them."}
{"text":"Ate here once, similar concept to Pieology. Can't really choose between the two just yet since it was my first time but we ordered the \"white top\" pizza with white sauce, bacon, arugula & mozzarella.  My only complaint was there was too much bacon bits on the pizza. I will have to alter my future orders if i plan on going with a signature pizza but it was delicious for the most part. I am also a big fan of the blood orange lemonade!"}
{"text":"This the BEST gluten-free pizza I have ever found!!!!   I had stopped eating pizza because the gluten-free options I had tried elsewhere seemed to be poor knock-offs for pizza.  I was skeptical that Blaze could be any different, but I was amazed at the taste!  They go the extra mile to make sure that those of us with a gluten allergy or gluten intolerance do not have cross-contamination issues.  The manager Steve explained to me that the gluten free dough is made before the regular pizza dough every morning iin order to prevent cross contamination.  They also change their gloves, wipe down any equipment and use special mats when baking in order to avoid cross contamination.  I have tried several of their specialty pizzas already and have enjoyed them all.  Try Blaze pizza- you will want to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times before, and all the experiences have been pleasant; Sunday was a different story. The woman working behind the counter took my order and proceeded to talk about how terrible her job is/ how tired she was/ how really nobody likes to work and just does it for the paycheck etc, all while moving at a snail's  pace. Before my pizza, she had been scraping handfulls of the excess toppings from earlier orders off of the prep area and into a trash can. She did not change gloves or sanitize before touching my food. It was nasty. Remainder of the service from other employees was mediocre. Lots more talk about what a drag work was, really a bad atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super fast and easy overpriced pizza! It's tasty and the way pizza should be. The allergen free options are unrivaled and supreme, really delightful for someone that has to avoid things like wheat or dairy. The online order system is very simple and so far very much on time. The standards like pepperoni pizza are run of the meal, id recommend exploring some of their more niche choices for toppings and sauces. They're really good!"}
{"text":"I was amazed with Blaze! It's a fast food pizza chain that's \"chipoltle-ized!\" Custom build your own pizza is what you can get here.
 
Build Your Own: 11 inch size.  Any amount of toppings. One price. $7.65 there is additional charge for gluten free and vegan cheese though 

What's Cool:
The sauces they offer. White cream, pesto drizzle to name a few.

The crust is super thin and crispy, which is less carbs to digest. It held the many toppings I had on there pretty well!
 
The choices of traditional &  artisanal cheeses they offer like goat cheese, ovalini mozzarella and Gorgonzola. 

Fresh veggies and herbs and sea salt for seasoning 

and the meats.. well Mr. B likes all the meats and the amount you can add on your pizza 

The assembly line starts with choosing what sauce you want on your dough,next cheese, then protein. Then pizza is fire'd and baked in blazing speeds. In about 180 minutes to be exact! 

For fast food type pizza, I was impressed with all the fresh ingredients and I was surprised I really liked the finished product. 

The menu board offers a bunch of their signature pizzas and salads too.  S'mores are their only choice for dessert. 

They won me over when I read they had BEET & Goat cheese salad! Yes Nate M. I am that crazy person that goes into a pizza place and orders something else on the menu because Im not into 'ZA :) 

Service was pretty quick and easy. Staff was really friendly and helpful.  If staff were out on the dining area they were nice enough to clear and bus tables and refill our drinks. There's also small pizza boxes readily available to pack up your leftovers. 

The place is kind of small and since there is only one line it could get cramped when it's busy. Fast casual,  order and pay and pick up your order at counter. They'll call your name when pizza is done. Seating in the dining area is also small for a fast food joint. If it fills up, there is more tables out on their patio facing Eastern Ave.

Perfect place to have lunch or a light dinner especially during the hot summer months."}
{"text":"Still quite a nooby business. I went there new years eve with my boyfriend and we used the app to order so it would be ready when we arrived. When we go there it wasnt ready yet and when we got them they flipped our order. The good thing was they offered to make 2 new pizzas for free... but they kind of messed that up too. The pizza leaves a bunch of charcoal dust on your fingers as well and im already a messy eater to begin with. Maybe give it some time for them to develop the business."}
{"text":"Yum.. really good pizza!

Kind and helpful staff.

This company also supports our locals schools - so let's support them and buy lots of their pizzas!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and I definitely see why this restaurant has such high reviews. Price is extremely fair- $12 for a customized pizza with unlimited toppings! The crust is just how I like it: thin! You can also opt in for a thicker crust for an extra $2 if that's what you prefer. 
I literally just went there yesterday and I'm already dying to go back. I wish they had more locations across the GTA. Also, their lemonade is delicious and you can get unlimited refills."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pizza in general but every once in a while, I will get a slight craving for it.  While I was in Toronto the other weekend, I got one of those cravings so I tried this place and it was a good choice.  The crust is nice and thin, there is a fantastic variety of toppings available, both meat and vegetarian, as well as multiple types of sauces and cheeses.  I found the ordering system a little confusing at first but watching others go through the process, it became clear as to how it's all organized.  I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"Dear Blaze,

I love your pizza and your concept (and your prices!!). And dayumm do you know your sauces. Your pizzas have made my night on multiple occasions, and for that I have to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

So why not 5 stars? Because I can remember when you first opened, the crust was PERFECT - crispy with exactly the right chewiness. And you were everything I ever wanted to have in my life. But somewhere in the past year or two, the consistency of the crust has started to dip - which I find slightly alarming. My past few tries, it has been a bit doughy, as if perhaps it could use an extra minute of love in the oven. 

You remain my favorite, and I will stay loyal. But please please please watch your crust!!

All my love."}
{"text":"Really good food and super friendly staff! It was my first time going and I know i will be coming back really soon"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at this place. Amazing selection of toppings that you can choose and mix and match without paying extra. Love this concept! 

The dough had a nice texture - Not too soft, not too hard, had some nice bite. And the person who was working explained everything to me since it was my first time there.

I would go back for sure. For 11.99$ and no limit on toppings, it's a reasonable personal size pizza that you can feel good about eating all around!"}
{"text":"Whoever thought of this idea about fast food pizza is a genius! 

Located in a prime location of Toronto, I always wanted to try this place out. I even heard that basketball star LeBron James invested into this place.

Upon entering, it had that Chipotle kind of feel with the decor. I heard that the Build your Own was worth it and you could put unlimited toppings on your pizza. The staff were pretty helpful with explaining how things worked and I started building my very own pizza.

They have tons of sauce and topping selections. So this is the fraction of what they had has I put these toppings on my pizza: classic sauce, 4 types of cheese, ham, pepperoni, mushroom, green peppers, zucchini, and to finish it off with presto drippings. 

The total came out to be $14.25 with a fountain drink which is pretty decent for a medium sized pizza. I was also impressed how fast the whole process goes and you get to watch your pizza bake in the oven too.

I will definitely recommend this place to my family and friends and I will be back for more blazing pizzas!"}
{"text":"Ate here a day or two after they opened and it was great.  Looked forward to going back.  Unfortunately the 2nd time was a disaster.  Everyone that was working seemed to be in slow motion.  The pizza toppings were minimal even after asking for additional - my pizza went from 4 half grape tomatoes to 6.  Really??   On top of that, the pizza just wasn't good.  There are way too many great pizza places in Charlotte to go to...we won't be going back to Blaze."}
{"text":"This is the Subway of pizzas! It's great, pay a fixed price for whatever toppings you want without additional charges, and the pizza here is delicious. I've been to Pieology and Pizza Rev which are a similar concept, but Blaze is the best. It is out my way to go in terms of travel, but never in terms of getting a good pizza. I look forward to going very soon again."}
{"text":"First time for me at this place. I really liked it. The pizza was really great. The employees were super nice. And the service was outstanding. Great atmosphere also. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great service! Emma made my pizza to my exact request and it came out really quick. Blaze is the best \"build your own\" pizza spots. Def way better than that place down the street! Pro tip: order the s'more pie but have them heat it up when you finish your pizza."}
{"text":"Great concept - very clean and quick with great options. I would recommend the spicy sauce."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place and planning on going back asap.  It's located in the new strip mall across from boardwalk billys.  You can order a pre-made option like meat lovers or BBQ chicken or you can build your own.  At the counter it's like a sandwich shop, you go down the line and tell them what toppings you want. From sauce to cheese to meats to veggies, and there is no up charge,  you can get as many toppings as you want.  They throw in the fire oven and a few minutes later it's ready. The crust is so crisp from the oven my it's delicious. It's  $8.50 for a pizza with unlimited toppings.
Also, they get busy during lunch, may want to go a little early!"}
{"text":"Service is always super friendly! Quality of ingredients is great. Even when you find a BOGO coupon on facebook and the line is out the door, they take care of business fast. I love this Subway-style pizza option, and I'm biased because this is my first over Fired Pie or Mod, but they seriously rock it out here. I stop here because I live in the neighborhood, but they deserve props regardless of their convenience!! I definitely recommend getting a pre-created recipe because it always tastes better than what I create for myself. It's hard not to put every option on your pizza when you're hungry!!!"}
{"text":"This place is such a fun spot to get some amazing pizza! There gluten free option is sooo good as well! Will definitely be coming back with some real estate clients, family, and friends."}
{"text":"Great spot for fast food pizza. When I went during a weekday lunch, they had lots and lots of employees to accommodate the rush.  Pizza was very tasty and prepared almost fast because of the rush and tends to get cold pretty fast because its thin. The premises seemed too small for the crowd.  Can't wait when another opens soon up on N. Decatur and the 215."}
{"text":"Yum.  Yum.  Yum.  I will definitely come back!  Tried all 4 salads and LOVED them equally!  Then drank the blood orange augua drink and that was amazing too. When I got my custom pizza... I was stoked!  The pizza was amazing too!  You could taste the quality ingredients and the pizza is wood fired perfectly!  Price is super reasonable ($8) too for a custom pie. Hubby was happy with his too."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Don't get me wrong pizza hut and Papa johns is still good pizza, but if you are looking for a better alternative as well as a little healthier then this is a place to go. You get to make your own pizza and my daughter loved that. You can change your taste bud with different and wide variety of choices of sauce, cheese and toppings that you wouldn't normally get from your delivery pizza. The location has good service, friendly people, and a lot of employees that make your order go faster and smoother. I orders a pizza and got it cooked and ready to eat in five min. I highly recommend this place. I know my daughter does."}
{"text":"One of my favourite pizza places! Been there once and am sold.
If you're ever shopping at Eaton or waiting for a movie at the Cineplex, come here for a bite to eat.

The staff are extremely happy and welcoming. I built my own pizza where for $10.45 and they were generous in your portions and never got angry if you kept wanting to load it up! The menu also has their own pizzas with toppings that they recommend, also for $10.45. But why not just go crazy with the toppings you like?

The crust is very thin, so it's very crispy and doesn't leave you in a carb coma. Also it's fired up in 2 mins so you won't be kept waiting. 

They also have take-out boxes for half pizzas if you can't finish it. 

Great experience overall! Nice spacious dining area and no-fuss ordering."}
{"text":"We ate there about 2 weeks ago. 
We waited in line and ordered 1 pizza to share. Food came out fast, hot and delicious! In my opinion definitely better than Piology. Same concept. Build your own pizza.
What I liked about Pizza Blaze comparing to Piology was that it wasn't burnt. We liked the dough and freshness of their toppings. 
And it's right in our neighborhood. Will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went yesterday around 5:30. I am a big fan of the build yourself concept (subway, chipotle). The pizza had very good flavor. Just watch too many \"wet\" items. The crust is so thin and cooked so quick that it soaks up the liquid like a cracker. I had to do the Brooklyn Fold. That said, we will go back. The reason for only 3 stars is the atmosphere. It is a great warehouse for a quick lunch, but not an enjoyable dinner. The room is sooo loud you have to scream at the person making your pizza. All you hear of the background music is the base, because that is all that breaks thru. And, in creating a positive customer attitude, the greeter was smiles and bubbly and happy. The expediter was a no smile or personality big bear. He should be a club bouncer."}
{"text":"This establishment offers many options and has kind and attentive staff. Who can beat unlimited fresh toppings? It's a bit cold inside so bring a jacket if you are easily chilly!  This place is for sure a family friendly environment and is cost effective."}
{"text":"Great place incredibly friendly staff really good pizza thin crust very crispy The fact that I loved this place is amazing because I'm from Chicago"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Blaze. I promise. I really did. But it left me wanting more. 

While they do have a variety of toppings, which is fun, I just didn't feel the overall quality was the best. Also the crust and sauce are just not good. I wanted my pizza to be cooked longer. Both times I've been, I didn't feel like the cheese had been given enough time to melt! Blaze is adequate...and what's that old saying? The pizza you're eating is always better than the pizza you're not eating?"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I loved it! The price is right for the pizza size and the ingredient selections. A bit slow on the line, but the management and customer service made up for it. The $9.00 pitchers is quite great as well!"}
{"text":"What a relief! After going to PIEOLOGY and finding out that their crust is NOT vegan, I drove all the way over to this place because I seriously wanted some pizza. 

You know when you just have a craving and the day isn't complete without satisfying that craving? Well that was me today after getting shut down at PIEOLOGY. Kind of happy that happened because if it didn't I probably would have prolonged coming here. Sometimes unfortunate circumstances can lead you to tasty pizza.

Atmosphere is chill here. Laid back music, simple modern decor and dining area. Even though it was super busy when I came in, it didn't take long for me to get to the ordering counter. 

The girl who started off my pizza creating experience was very sweet and even asked if I wanted employees to change their gloves for my order upon telling her that I'm vegan! Hell yeah. I feel needy when I have to ask for the glove change but for real I don't like the thought of animal juices touching my pizza.

Speaking of toppings, they have everything I want on a vegan pizza: spinach, basil, mushrooms, roasted garlic, roasted red pepper, artichoke hearts, zucchini, red onion and of course the obligatory oregano just to name a few. 

I don't care if it's further from my house, if I want a delicious and QUALITY vegan pizza I'm coming here from now on."}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza is super good! You can build your own pizza for a great price with a bunch of options. The customer service is great and the restaurant is aways clean when I stop by with clients after looking at potential houses. If you are in the area want some good pizza, want it fast, and want it in a timely matter stoop by Blaze. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff ,bigger interior  than Henderson and fantastic pizza .  Fast cooking and great choices!. Outdoor seating available.   Located just off the 215 Northern Beltway"}
{"text":"First visit to Blaze and was very impressed with the staff especially Justine, Tay and Greg!! They were awesome. An asset to your establishment. Pizza was awesome and the Greek salad was Great! Recommend the BYO GREAT VALUE."}
{"text":"Yummy yum yum!  Delicious pizza customized to your liking for a decent price. For $7 and some change,  you get a nice size pizza with UNLIMITED TOPPINGS! My husband and I shared one, each getting our own toppings. The pizza is made in front of you (similar to Subway style) then placed in an open fire oven. Served hot and ready to eat; I definitely see what the rave was about.
Just a sidenote: the place is clean and modern with a hint of a rustic look.  I personally like it."}
{"text":"Shout out to this blaze location for looking out for vegans/ people with dairy allergies. When I said I wanted vegan cheese the guy automatically asked if I'd like him change his gloves. I don't really mind because I don't have an allergy, but i know that's really important for a lot of people. So thank you for being considerate !!!"}
{"text":"Great day casual restaurant. The standard pizzas are about 12 dollars and are delicious. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Was about it. Definitely want to try some more options but it was fast, easy and delish! There's quite a bit of space to sit but if does get busy. I tried the BBQ chicken and I liked it. One person can definitely eat an entire one on their own (6 slices) but it also is a good portion to share with someone else. Would def recommend this place for a quick bite of pizza that doesn't feel like you're gonna knock out after eating."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, thin crust, fast service, and the option to add toppings at no extra charge. A great spot to stop by for a quick bite. Reasonable prices too! Really enjoyed my lunch here today!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love the pizza here. My low review is due to the customer service I received today. I made an online order for 5 pizzas for a working lunch at the office and went to pick it up. When I got to the register I saw a sign that said \"Download the Blaze App and get a free drink.\" So I ordered 4 drinks, and while I was downloading the app I showed the Cashier gal to redeem my free drink. She almost handed me the cup then pulled it back, saying she needed to check with the manager. I said \"OK\", I can understand that, but then she turned around and asked a co-worker putting pizzas in the oven, and he confirmed her judgment and said \"yeah, we should ask the manager.\" While I do understand that they may not know if the promotion is still running, I found it a little distasteful because the sign is posted ON the cash machine, it's very visible. and it's just a drink, after all. I went to fill up the other 4 drinks and when I returned, all was forgotten. They handed me the drink holder but never followed up to give me an answer. It was clear they didn't ask the manager or cared to at least tell me \"no.\" I just bought $50 worth of pizzas and am a loyal customer, and have full intentions of using the app and will continue eating here. I know it's just a drink but I think the entire staff should a) know what promotions are going on or b) if they don't know, but it's posted and it's something trivial like a free small drink, to just support it bc that's just good customer service. Sorry for the bad review, but I was disappointed today."}
{"text":"First time I've been to this location.  Pretty much the same as all the rest.  Great pizza, served quickly with whatever toppings you like.

This spot should do great being so close to university.  This little section of the shopping center should honestly have some bus parking.  So close to the interstate and so many choices right there.

Onto the food.  I've not been liking red sauces as of recent, something to do with the acidity.  So, pesto or white sauce was my way to go.  I love the roasted red peppers, the garlic, and the spinach, have gotten that on almost every pie I've ever tried from them.  Fresh arugula on the finish as well.

Always good, always tasty.  There was a table beside us with a crowd that wasn't really very pleasant to my crowd or some others, but they looked pretty serious about wanting to fight.  This has nothing to do with the business per say, but they might want to think about a security person after 8pm, especially on the Friday and Saturday night crowds.  JMHO."}
{"text":"I returned to Blaze Pizza for the first time in several months. The restaurant itself is not changed ( see my prior review). However my opinion has changed. In my initial trip to Blaze Pizza I was turned off by the relatively flavorless thin crust. Well, the crust hasn't changed. But my approach to ordering the pizza has. Since the crust was not going to be a significant positive, I decided to load up the toppings. Now, the toppings were excessively plentiful and very tasty. The ton of toppings was able to  mask the fact that the crust was not very good.  So when you bury a mediocre crust with a ton of toppings that you really enjoy, the pizza tastes really good. Still not my favorite pizza in town, but a good place to go for a fast $10 lunch."}
{"text":"Came in on Friday the 15 with my grandson because he wanted some pizza. We decided to try this place out and the pizza was really good . One of the young ladies by the name of \"Pricilla \" gave me one of the best service ever. I would definitely recommend this place and I would go back:)"}
{"text":"Soooo, I am a picky pizza guy, as I am from Brooklyn, NY and I love my NY pizza above all, and when I alternate, I only eat Gino's East Chicago deep dish. HOWEVER, this whole concept of building your own pizza, the toppings, the flavor, the sauce (I like the spicy sauce and the regular is good too), and alas, the end result is delicious! I go for the regular thin crust, and I put the cherry on top to my experience with their blood orange lemonade! SOOOO DELICIOUS! I will say that the owners are AWESOME and make you feel at home...but last time there was a woman there (some blonde lady), and she had a bit of an unpleasant attitude, but don't be discouraged; this place is awesome! No true complaints, only compliments! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Blaze is 3min walk from my place so I had to try it on its opening day and it didn't disappoint! My friend and I ordered online for two build-your-own pizza - I like how easy the whole process was. When I get there, the pizza doughs were ready to bake to ensure the freshness (which I like). I only waited for 3-4 mins and the final products were worth the wait. Both of them were thin, crusty and perfectly seasoned. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I am pleasantly surprised by this fast casual spot. The self rising crust for the pizza is delicious and the spicy tomato sauce is a great flavour without the generic spicy taste. I also love how their ovalini mozzarella melts really stretchy.


Cons: their lines are annoying. I recommend u order online through their app."}
{"text":"Whaaaaaaaaaaat??? Wow!!!!!!!! I really enjoyed Blaze Pizza. Unlimited topping for about $8? Can't beat it. Quality pizza and ingredients. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came for the grand opening! It was busy! But moved quickly. The concept is wonderful. I love it. The pizzas are big and could be split if you're not a big eater. Prices are good too! Will be back."}
{"text":"My first time here and I'm pretty impressed. It's basically set up like Chipotle, except with pizzas. They have their preset toppings or you can choose to build your own. We opted for the red vine and the bbq chicken pizza. Service was fast and friendly. The pizzas prepared quickly and came out thin crust,  toppings were fresh and delicious. Price was reasonable too, at around $7 each. I recommend this place if you're looking for something quick, tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Loved how you can choose unlimited toppings. 
Service time is great too. 1 star docked as quality could be a bit better."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good. I had been itching to try blaze pizza since I first heard of them about 6 months ago. Not at all disappointed. My wife and I went on friday evening around 8pm. Despite being very busy we were sitting and eating our hot pizzas within about 6-8 mins from walking in the door. I ordered a BYO with pepperoni, bacon, sausage, roasted garlic, sautéed onions with a spicy red sauce. My wife ordered the green stripe add olives. Mine was awesome. For a fresh pizza made in less 10 mins, with as many toppings as I wanted for $8. Service was solid, albeit a little chaotic, but they got the job done. Space is decent size, wouldn't want to go there with more than 4 people. I have tried similar restaurants like MOD pizza. Blaze has the edge in my opinion."}
{"text":"This was a sort of planned visit as was catching a movie later on next door. As the time was limited had to choose a place nearby. I hadn't had a chance to look at their menu beforehand but after going through their already designed pizza menu one can easily find something that will be OK. If that doesn't work you build your own which would require you to go through their extensive options.  Decided to stick with some familiar topping versions Vino (like a margherita) and artisan version (artichoke and dollops of what felt like marinara). First of the assembly line looks chaotic to me as I counted three people handling my pizza (maybe their process consultant went overboard here) and each repeating my order, kind of reminded me of chipotle to tell you the truth. It wouldn't have mattered if the end product is good and one gets the pizza in a reasonable amount of time. 
Here is the verdict either their pizza oven needs to be hotter or they need to sauce a little less  or cook a bit longer as the crust was wet! ingredients are decent so can't fault them there, am not expecting a lot at this price range. Service was decent though its mostly self service. I would rate it way above the chain which makes you say the product name twice. This location will bring in crowds as well I guess. I would say almost 3 stars."}
{"text":"Affordable, great for sharing and delicious. And who doesn't love pizza? You can pick from their signature pizzas (I love the white top) or build your own, salads are good too. The line is usually long but it moves fast. The only downside is that it's just like Chipotle, where you have to talk to every single employee while ordering. Just be ready to constantly ask \"huh?' or \"what was that?' because it's pretty noisy in there, it's difficult to hear anything. On a positive note, I've become increasingly good at reading lips lol. They do get points for always being very clean and everyone is friendly. The kids love it, so we visit fairly often. Solid pizza joint."}
{"text":"They had free pizza tonight ! A huge line but well worth it !!! I would defiantly go here again - prob one of the best pizzas houses in town !"}
{"text":"Second experience was much better than the first. Gluten free crust is delicious, they have separate sauce if you have an allergy that doesn't touch the \"normal\" dough (though they're cooked in the same oven). A lot of toppings, cooks in 180 seconds, but pretty small for the price. The first time I came there were 16 staff members behind the counter  (2 weeks after they opened) and it was chaos. I was very intimidated to walk up to the counter. The second time about half the amount and much friendlier/low key. Kids in line were excited to be designing their own pizzas, great for them!"}
{"text":"What is there not to like about this place? For a little over $10 you can get a customized pizza in less than 7 minutes! Unlimited toppings! They can literally do anything you like, which I think is pretty amazing. The staff is also great in helping you out.

Drinks are $2.50. I don't recall perfectly but I do think the cashier said it was free refills. 

I would totally go back again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came for dinner 

Pros 

Well priced ($11 per pizza) 
Seating was available 
Quick service 
Great taste 
They don't hold back on the toppings 
Customize it however you like 

Cons 

None"}
{"text":"Lives up to its claims. Good pizza, good value, customizable, and the line moved quickly.  Oh, and how can you go wrong with smores for dessert? If you want to get picky, sure, the crust could be chewier, less crunchy, but it was still tasty. I'd go back for sure. Oh, and I really liked the agua frescas. Not very sweet but tasty. Great alternative to the sugary drinks and pop. Kids loved them."}
{"text":"The best deal in town for Italian-style pizza, in such a convenient location too! For less than $15 I was served a thin crust 8ish-inch pizza with unlimited toppings. The shop is fast food style, but there's plenty of seating.

The key highlight is Italian-style pizza - the thin crust is solid but not overly crisp, and there is no problem with excess oil leaking through the thin dough. Toppings are Italian style - you can find your generic pepperoni and peppers and pineapple, but do diversify into the various types of cheese, veggies, and meats. They've got it all from turkey meatballs to artichoke hearts, soft cheeses and different sauces, and you can finish it all off with olive oil or balsamic drizzle, just as an example. And remember - one price for them all! Your pizza won't be having that thick layer of mozzarella like Other chain pizza shops in town, but it will bring out all the flavours of your toppings. Note that some toppings come at a premium, but there's plenty of excellent selection that exceeds your average pizza place already included in your set price. Also, be strategic - it seems like good bang for your buck to ask for everything, but do you need it and will you taste everything? Less is more, and your crust will appreciate it by staying crispy on the bottom.

Service is a quick line style, at the end you can put in your order for drinks or dessert (a tad expensive and personally unnecessary to polish my meal). Your pizza will go in the oven and they will call out your name when it's ready, so be alert! If anything goes wrong during the pizza process, rest assured they'll be glad to remake - be patient and understand it happens."}
{"text":"The build your own pizza joint is definitely popular in the city right now and Blaze holds it's own, the pizza is definitely good. Compared to other similar joints though, Blaze is even better because they offer thin and thick crust pizzas and, for people like me, vegan cheese. Other build your owns I've been to don't have these options. And another plus, in the service department, the girl serving me made sure to ask if I wanted her to change her gloves after she'd touched regular cheese for my boyfriend's pizza. So considerate!!"}
{"text":"I've been a here a few of times and have had inconsistent experiences with the quality of pizza. During my first visit, I thought that my pizza was cooked perfectly. The other times, didn't turn out as good. Either way, it's decent pizza for the prize. I also like the idea of choosing my own toppings, specially with an unlimited toppings option."}
{"text":"Fast, easy, respectable and easy going customer service! Food was tasty too! Shout out to Ray! Thanks"}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Actually tried for first time because of special free delivery offer from Postmates.  I liked the charred crust and the toppings were good.  I also ordered a Cobb salad side and it was very good."}
{"text":"Pizza is life. 
I have walked across this place so many times and wondered if it worth a try (I try to stay away from eating in places that are in touristy areas) but I couldn't resist after reading all the amazing reviews on Yelp.
All I can say is the pizza DELICIOUSLY Satisfying. We got the BBQ chicken with the spicy sauce (you have to ask for it or they will put regular) and when it comes out of the oven, they drizzle it with olive oil, bbq sauce, and pesto (I had to ask them for pesto sauce ) and it definitely hit the spot. The pizza dough is not too thick and not too thin and just the right amount thickness to hold the ingredients without it being soggy. I've had a lot of pizza in my life but this one is tasty and fulfilling with the perfect price. Two people can easily share one but If you're like me and just as obsessed about pizza as I am...then get your own and devour it!!!!"}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza is a great new addition to the food choices at Yonge and Dundas. Spinal Cord Injury Ontario had an event there and Blaze Pizza gave us a great deal. Best of all, though, the pizza was amazing and everyone loved it. Give it a try. SCI Ontario gives Blaze Pizza the thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Pizza amazing...Employees suck...Was like 50 people in uniform..2 working others chatting...Manager should have def sent half the staff home earlier and tighten them up....Get them off their phones....I don't blame the kids working but the adult managing whoever that was."}
{"text":"Worker are very slow. When we arrive, there was about 8 pp in front of us. We wait 15 minutes and the firs 3 that we're ordering they were still ordering.
Not a fast pase restaurant like the other I been to."}
{"text":"Oh Blaze.....you make my heart HAPPY. 

After hearing the rave reviews from the grand opening, I couldn't wait to give this place a try! I arrived for lunch right after 11:30 - you have to get there early! This place fills up fast! But don't worry they move the line fast! 

So first things first...prepare to be overwhelmed...it's all the toppings you want...and the cheese you want...for the same price. 

 Shut the front door! 

The best part - service here is amazing! Everyone was so accommodating! They really made sure that my pizza was made exactly like I want and I left a happy customer.
 
I decided to try the White Top which comes with their version of the white cream sauce, mozzarella, bacon, chopped garlic, oregano and then it's sprinkled with arugula. I added ricotta cheese, mushrooms and Italian sausage I mean...why not? Its unlimited toppings!!! 

Once my masterpiece was created they popped it in the oven 180 seconds and I was out the door. But not without stopping for a quick snap of my delicious pie! 

The first bite was everything I expected and more! The best part was the crust, it was so light and crispy. I enjoyed every single bite! 

There's so much more I want to try here - they have a spicy red sauce and tons of fresh toppings calling my name!"}
{"text":"So a new knock off of My Pie & Fired Pie felt the need to move in when the other two have locations within a 5 min drive of this place (....why? ) 

anyway, despite the stupid name of the business (insert stupid college weed joke here. Yuk yuk.) the pizzas fine. I have been to all three of these fast pizza places and this has been my least favorite. 

Lighter than my pie and fired pie with the toppings & the line is three times as long. Go the extra .2 miles to fired pie. Better toppings, more of it, less wait. All win."}
{"text":"This is a nice little gem of a place. The food is made to order and served hot, any toppings you want from regular to gourmet toppings. This is a really fun place to go with friends and family, the food is good and price is good. I habe been here 3 times and all 3 times food was excellent. For sure het their fresco lemonde (free refill if dinning in) for dessert i got their smores sandwhich. The service is great and friendly!"}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza has mastered the craft of customizable fast-fired pizza. For one price, you get to build your own pizza (pick your crust, sauce, and unlimited toppings). They have two different types of crust, but I'd go with their thin crust for the more authentic fast-fired style. They have traditional red sauce, spicy red sauce, white sauce, and a pesto sauce. You can even mix sauces or do half-half on either side of the pizza if you want to try multiple! I always do the spicy red sauce, with the pesto garlic sauce on top. Then you get to the toppings. It can get overwhelming with so many options, but the staff are totally kind, helpful, and efficient. If you eat meat, you're in luck here because you can add on all the meats you want! After you pick your toppings, they fire your pizza and you can add arugala on top or pesto drizzle.  

Honestly, I haven't found a fast-fired pizza place that does it the way Blaze does. Of course, it's cheaper to order in Domino's or whatever, but when you want to treat yourself to a personal pizza -- Blaze is the place to go. Something about their pizza is so delicious, and the fact that you can customize it to your liking makes it all the more better."}
{"text":"Good thin crust pizza made to order.
Good tasting Blood Orange Lemonade.
Salads made to order, prices are cheap, two people can eat Pizza for $12"}
{"text":"Eduardo was Amazing capital A!!!! Super patient and very accommodating. First time coming here and I was very excited when I found out I could get a gluten free crust and vegan cheese. Employees were courteous and upbeat !"}
{"text":"Why haven't I tried this earlier?? This is a pretty cool pizza shop near the Eaton Centre. The menu is relatively simple - you can either build your own (with UNLIMITED toppings!) or select from the pre-designed pizzas. You can also pick the type of crust you want (thin/thick/gluten-free). There is an amazing variety of toppings you can choose from - different types of cheeses, various meats, lots of veggies, etc. Pizza is delicious and the environment is casual - good place to hang out with friends!

Fun fact: LeBron James is one of the investors!"}
{"text":"Great location and friendly staff. Best pizza hands down. Love the thin crust and fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Welcoming and great staff, pizza is very good! I enjoyed my white sauce pizza very much, ingredients are fresh and they do the pizza in front of you and on a fire furnace.... yummy! 

The only thing I have to say is that the pizza was too thin for me and because of that it was not a perfect experience for me (I like pizza a little bit thicker), but that was my fault because you can actually order a thicker base (and a gluten free one)."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times have been great! The ingredients are fresh and the pizzas are cooked to perfection. Definitely a new spot on our list of places we hit."}
{"text":"This place is lit! Mr manager Josh hooked it UP with lots of helpful info, gave us some promos,  annnnd got us all set up on their mobile app. He's the man! Food was bomb and at a really cheap price. Food was ready super quick and all of the staff were very helpful! :)"}
{"text":"This place was good. I enjoyed my pizza. My husband did not enjoy his but I think that was more him not knowing exactly what Gouda cheese was prior to adding it to his pizza rather than the service or other food. So if you aren't sure what Gouda is you may not want to try it for the first time on a pizza but otherwise I am sure you will enjoy what Blaze has to offer."}
{"text":"Blaze is a pizza place I keep returning to, finding excuses to be on that side of town to just \"drop by\" for lunch.  The pizza is not perfect in a gourmet sense, but it's so \"right\" and so fresh that I don't care.  The unique \"dough press\" gets the crust thickness right every time, no expert tossing required.  The topping choice is extensive and laid out for all to see.  I've been at least four times before writing this review and I don't see a reason to stop.  You get to make it like you want it in a great personal size, quickly baked, at a prime price.  What's not to love about that?"}
{"text":"The pizza was great. The line was long but it wasn't a long wait until one of our pizzas came out burnt, they remade it right away but we waited double the time. 7.95 byo. The artichokes here are delicious."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pizza here. I had the art lover on my first visit. It doesn't have much sauce on it, but it was delicious. It had artichokes, mozzarella, ricotta, chopped garlic, and red sauce dollops. I also had them add oregano and sea salt before they popped it into the fire oven. 180 seconds (3 minutes) later, a perfect pizza. The pizzas feed 1-2 people, depending on how hungry you are. The blood orange lemonade is my favorite. 

The staff are well trained and super friendly. I hope they keep what they got going. I enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing from Blaze. Better than Mod, Fired Pie, Pieology, etc. What makes this location really special is the service. Every member of the staff is amazing. I had a great conversation with the manager/owner that made me feel very welcome and that my regular visits were appreciated. I will definitely continue to come back and recommend anyone with a hankering for delicious pizza, quick and hospitable service come to this Blaze Pizza location."}
{"text":"The food was of poor quality. The restaurant itself the music was so loud you couldn't have a conversation. And I didn't feel like shouting at the person I was with. Nor did the people behind the counter want me to shot at them nor did they want to shout at me so we had a very difficult time communicating. Don't waste your time don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Love this place! Getting to create your own pizza with all the toppings you want is awesome! The price is reasonable and the service is pretty quick. Next time I'll have to try the s'mores. My son loves the blood lemonade. The music is a little loud but the restaurant layout is great for small or large groups."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I felt like I needed to express how delicious this place is! It is like a chipotle pizza place. The pizzas are so delicious and you get to pick one of their creations or YOU CAN CREATE YOUR OWN!! With as many toppings as you want for a set price and the pizzas are a really good size, their staff is so friendly and their vibe is incredible. I went with a group of my girlfriends and we lovedour pizzas and the service! I would definitely recommend trying it, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Nice crispy deliciousness..ant thin crispy thin..one of the best pizza but definetly the best for the value...can t beat it!!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at blaze and my pizza was amaaaaazing! The crust is light and crispy and just the right size. From the second we walked in, the staff was friendly and welcoming and seemed more than happy to be working. Overall, a great pizza place and will be recommending them to everyone I know! (:"}
{"text":"Delightful.  Hubby and I were looking for a place like Pieology so I looked up places near me and this place popped up.  Seen it and never stopped in, so read the reviews.  Most were 5 stars so we said let's do it.  Glad we did.  Good fresh food and fast friendly service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My first time here, and I do have to say that I'm impressed! $8.25 for a pizza that you customized. Unlimited toppings. I love their red sauce, add a tad of pesto and then the meats, veggies and a must have, pineapple. Although the wait for the finished product took less time than ordering, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. I do think a thicker crust is needed, in which that's an option I'll try next. My first time with salami on my pizza, what an amazing flavor!  I'll be back, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"My first time here and Asia is amazing !! Great customer service super friendly she walked around asking how everything was just superb service overall everyone was super friendly but Asia left an impression . 

We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I went and had my first Blaze pizza today and it was AMAZING! I got 1/3 meat eater and 1/2 art lover. I got extra cheese, extra artichokes,  black olives, green peppers, I cotta cheese.... all types of stuff. The staff was so cool I had to give a compliment to th entire team to the district manager. The ingredients are fresh and baked baked to perfection . I'm instantly hooked. I will be going at least a few times a month now"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place.  My 3 year old had a blast picking and choosing what will go on his side of the pizza. 

Blood orange lemonade was amazballs! Yummy. 

Next time I want to try the s'mores."}
{"text":"One of my the best pizza I've tasted - I order the meat specialty pizza and it was very good! The ingredients are fresh and the service is fast! They have a good variety of selection and they also offer a combination between half a pizza and salad!"}
{"text":"YESSSSSS. I don't know what to say besides that. This place has jumped up to the top of my 'go-to' list of lunch/dinner choices. 

Seriously, a pizza with ANY toppings you want for around $8 ---- unreal. You can load it up with 6 meats and 15 veggies and it's still just $8. 

The bad part about your Blaze experience is picking which items you're going to leave off this round. As far as your food goes, the ingredients are incredibly fresh & delicious. It's truly up to you how good or bad you pizza is based on what you pick.

if you're not sure and want to go with a 'pre-built' pizza ... the white top & the BBQ chicken are   hands down solid choices."}
{"text":"So, this was my first time here. My friends who are locals brought me here because I'm vegetarian and told me this would be a great option.

As they hyped it up, I got excited. They told me, \"if you order one of the pizzas, you get to put whatever toppings you want on it!\"

After going in, I found out that you can order a \"Make your Own\" pizza or a \"Signature\" pizza. Both were great options for me, but I went with the Veg out pizza. They ask for your name, so be ready to give it. 

I took the zucchini off, added extra mushrooms, garlic, red and green peppers, extra red sauce dollops, and oregano. I should've added some extra mozzarella.

A few moments later, my pizza was ready. At the end when they call you to pick it up, they will ask what topping sauces or pieces you would like. I got the arugula and the pesto sauce.

Overall, it was a great choice and a great atmosphere. I can't wait to go back for some amazing reasonably priced pizza."}
{"text":"This place is kind of like a Subway for pizza as far as the set up. You tell them what you want on your pizza and they make it as you tell them. They then put your personal pizza in the oven to cook. Surprisingly the pizza was really good! Fresh ingredients with good tasting sauce. The customer service was really good too. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"First time at Blaze Pizza, and I was converted.       Blaze Pizza is a personal any topping, anyway you like it for a very reasonable low price. You can choose a crust type (regular, a thicker one, and gluten free). Choice of sauces and topping make this a pizza lover's dream. You can also select finishers/sauces forwhen your pizza comes out. 

For a beverage, I'd suggest the blood orange lemonade. Tangy, but sweet enough to enjoy with you favorite pizza slice. 

Would come back again!"}
{"text":"All the DIY quick-fire pizza spots tend to blend together for me, but I've had positive experiences at this Blaze. They're located in the same plaza as Sprouts, so after double ad Wednesdays I'm too drained to actually cook the groceries I just bought so I often pop in here. I'm only half kidding.

You can get a plain cheese pizza, one topping, 2 toppings, or DIY (~$8) with everything you want. Multiple crust options and GF/vegan available, along with side salads and desserts. The original crust here is comparable to the regular one at Pizza Rev, but the toppings are applied a bit lighter here. I do like how they have add-ons like arugula or various drizzles (pesto, buffalo, ranch) after your pie gets out of the oven. Portion is more than enough for one meal and service along the line is friendly, shout out to Sukari!

TIP: Download the app for discounts and freebies. In a month, I've already gotten three offers (bogo, free drink, free dessert)."}
{"text":"This location has great customer service. Pooh did a wonderful job of giving my family and I different options as far as pizzas. She actually recommended the green stripe for me and its now one of my favorite choices! Very friendly and a welcoming environment. their black cherry soda is amazing!!! It goes perfect with my go to pizza, the BBQ chicken pizza on a high rise. The only thing I ask for is to include credit card tips. I was pretty offended to see how empty their tip jar was on Pi Day considering the line was out the door for what seemed like all day. Please include credit card tips as an option, these employees all look young and it wouldn't kill us as customers to treat them as well. 4 stars because of the credit card issue but other than that everything is great :)"}
{"text":"Here, you get to build your own pizza, the have main toppings, but lots of additional add-ons. And you can specify how much sauce, etc. as you wak down the little assembly line.  The ingredients look fresh, and the oven baking really does seem pretty fast.  

I go the chocolate chip brownie, it was kind of disappointing - I would not recommend wasting any money on their desserts."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Pretty unique place. Love the customization options for the pizzas! Friendly staff, great customer service and very affordable versus the big name chains."}
{"text":"Was a secondary choice, after the Malaysian restaurant we were going to, was closed. Great 2nd choice! Most expensive pizza is $10.45 and any of them will not disappoint. From order to box-in-hand was 8 minutes. Got the BBQ chicken and my mate got the all meat. We swapped a piece of each others' pie and loved our choices. Great choice for lunch, but I would recommend being their before 11:30 or you'll be stuck in a line-up of eager customers. Big five stars!"}
{"text":"I used to go to these build your own pizza places all the time in LA (I haven't been to Blaze... not sure if they have locations there). I'm glad this place has opened up in Toronto. 

I have to say that I actually preferred this to most of the ones I went to in LA. First of all the price is very reasonable (just under $11 for a build your own).  

You don't get a choice of base (eg gluten free, etc). But there's a few different sauces to choose from. Also, they do have goat cheese available, which I love. 

I always go pretty crazy with the toppings at these places.... It's hard to say no because they all look good. After I was done, my pizza was stuffed. Everything ended up going well together though. 

Pizza takes a couple of minutes to prepare. It's super thin crust. I guess that means its healthier... so I don't feel bad devouring the whole thing. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service, affordable prices for quality toppings&nice location.  Tasty pizza for an assembly line. Will be back."}
{"text":"So who doesn't love pizza. The concept is great like another reviewer said. But the horrible customer service from the young employees (multiple visits) cost them future business from me. Hopefully the franchisee addresses them before more customers are lost."}
{"text":"Right in the centre of Yonge and Dundas, Blaze Pizza scores big with fresh ingredients, a thin, chewy crust and fast service. All round great place to eat. 

I ordered the 10.45 unlimited toppings pizza and was given the option to choose a sauce, assorted cheeses and assorted toppings. Every topping is clearly labelled so you never have to awkwardly point at something and hope they know what you're pointing to. The meat and veggie ingredients are separated and they even took special care in cutting the veggie pizzas with a veggie only pizza cutter, I was very pleased with that :)

As for the flavour, the pizza was hot, the ingredients were fresh and the cheese was gooey and yummy. I loved it! 

P.S. the blood orange lemonade was also a great accompaniment to this pizza!"}
{"text":"Such a delicious treat to have a pizza done up how you like it. The spicy sauce will make your favorite pizza zing for sure. Love the crust, and the fired oven gives it that special kiss. Love this place."}
{"text":"Came for free pizza night last night! Its wood fired pizza and you go through the line.. chipotle style, and make your custom pizza or choose one of their recipes. I chose the white pizza that had arugula , bacon and cheese, I added basil. It's a thin crust pizza and pretty tasty, except mine was a little burnt, but ok not complaining - it was free! I would definitely come back, prices are fair! Looking for something different, give this a try! They will have a NLV location in the future. The only cons that I see.. and maybe cause it was opening night, very noisy- make sure your loud voice works! And also  their were so many people back their running around and the fire guy constantly yelling HOT!! And bringing that blazin' hot pizza out- that has accident written all over it. But that's the nurse in me  Be Careful!"}
{"text":"Opened for over a year and a half and only a mile from my home - I finally made it over to this place. Ordered my pizza online for pickup.  The staff works hard and is very friendly. I am absolutely enthralled by the pizza! Also, great pizza for a very reasonable price. Love it and am sad it took me so long to try it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the pizza very much. Went today for the free one but my son enjoyed it so much we will be continuing to go. Prices are very inexpensive and the whole idea of all the pizzas being the same price works out perfect. Fresh ingredients and the pizza was just the right amount of crusty."}
{"text":"Every employee was very friendly and accomodating and for the price and quality, I will definitely be a regular. Now, having said that, Settebello is absolutely the best in town, unfortunatel, it is double the price. Blaze is my new go to place. Very good!!!"}
{"text":"Very efficient and fast personal pizza making! I love going and trying new flavors! Such an incredible variety and fresh toppings. Has a variety of things to drink too! Perfect if you have a group who each wants different pizza toppings or likes unique/creative pizzas!"}
{"text":"So as I have stated in other pizza place reviews, I think pizza is super subjective.  I mean, all food is, but pizza is just one of those things that the crust for one person is divine, while it tastes like crackers for another.  For me, Blaze has some insanely good pizza at a super reasonable price.  

I am a basics girl...pepperoni, cheese, maybe some olives or mushrooms.  Blaze gets it spot on. Deliciousness.  Crust tastes perfect, sauce is a bit spicy and sweet,and if you order the build your own for 7.95, they will add extra of anything if you don't feel like it is enough.  Nice...

Service is great and the only reason they lost a star is because I ordered online once and was ignored when I come in to pick it up.  This resulted in a 30 minute wait and eventually a cold pizza.  However, this pizza is well worth the wait and I will even eat it cold if that is the only way I can get it!"}
{"text":"I love the build your own concept! The prices are very reasonable as well, under $10 for whatever creation you make, as well as set prices for a 1 or 2 topping. Only semi complaint is the fresh basil is kept in a pan of water and is a little, soggy. Oh! And they have a rewards program in their app so make sure to download it and get some benefits."}
{"text":"Interesting pick your own pizza toppings place. I've been here twice and will probably keep coming back. I know the pizza is a bit on the expensive side but it's great to load it up with toppings like bacon, ham, spinach, calamata, and many many more. Apparently you can also get split red or white sauce.  So many toppings, so little time! 

I know Lebron isn't the most favorite guy in Toronto right now but you cant question his pizza choices!"}
{"text":"First time there. We will DEFINITELY be back! It's laid out like a Chipotle and you have them put your pizza together and they pop it in the oven while you wait. The whole staff is fast and friendly and provide GREAT service.

Cooked to order pizzas...great price.....great service

Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"They offer vegan cheese which is awesome! Not only do they offer it, but they have one of the best vegan pizzas I have tried. I rarely eat meat, but when I have a taste for a meat lovers I can come here too. This is my new pizza place, it is worth getting out the house for instead of waiting for delivery."}
{"text":"Overall good pizza for the price. What I love about this idea is that each person can make their own pizza and add whatever items they want. The size is design for one person but if your not a big eater you can share with another person or a small child. They have coke products which is always a plus in my eyes. The restrooms and seating area is clean. The only thing I didn't like was that they put little cheese and I had to ask for more. Overall good pizza and good service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I really loved going here. I can't wait to go back some time. My husband is always raving about this place. It's decent pricing for what you get."}
{"text":"Leon and Tamaya made two pizzas for me and my friend. They had awesome personalities and made us feel very welcomed. It was my first time at this restaurant and i agreed to go after my friend raved about it. I was pleasantly surprised! I would definitely recommend this place to a friend and tell them to ask for Leon or Tamaya! They had such a positive attitude about being at work."}
{"text":"We first experienced Blaze Pizza in Orlando, FL and it was amazing! We were so excited to see one open in Concord. I placed an online order- one spicy red sauce, chicken, pepperoni, and jalapeños. This pizza had barely any of the requested toppings on it. The second pizza was a bbq chicken pizza and there was no bbq sauce on it!  When I arrived to pick up the order I went straight to the pick up line, where there were two gentleman working that section. I waited for probably 2 mins and did not get greeted although neither of them appeared to be busy. Finally, I asked if there was an order ready under my name. I was handed the pizzas and that was that. I am disappointed in both the service and the product. The Blaze in Orlando is much better!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight on an empty stomach and sure glad I did too! The customer service was excellent and the pizza even better!!! This may be by far the best pizza I've ever tasted,fresh dough baked into a light thin crust and organic toppings to seal in moisture with an array of robust flavors sent me STRAIGHT TO THE MOON. It is most certainly a GUARANTEE that I will be dining here very soon...How does tomorrow sound? Who's with me?"}
{"text":"Usually this location is very good but this last time I went my pizza was basically raw. It was on pi day and we waited for an hour and a half so I didn't take it back or call them.  But I was disappointed to say the least.  Make sure you check your dough and check that it's cooked all the way through!"}
{"text":"The thinly crust pizza has fresh ingredients. Lots of variety of toppling a to choose from including spinach and artichoke hearts if so you choose. 
I love the sauté garlic cloves and availability of ricotta cheese. Very flavorful and very reasonable for the portions. I like the fact that it is a personal pizza as I don't have to share. Hee hee"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizza joint, the staff is funny and friendly and always smiling JT was a great guy made me feel like I was at home eating, and Pooh was great she talked to us and told us the new things to come great staff well done Blaze"}
{"text":"I wish I could go 4 1/2 stars.  The staff is always super friendly and helpful.  The pizza is very good for this kind of pizza.  While they do have some variations for drink options, not having the cadillac of soda machines with 100+ combinations is weird to me when you have the 100+ pizza options.

Overall 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I love BYOP places. This was my first time trying Blaze and the pizza was delicious. I think the crust is better than PizzaRev, otherwise it's pretty much the same place. They have vegan options which adds extra points for me! The staff even made sure to change their gloves when handling my pizza once I asked for vegan cheese. They also have vegan 'chicken' and a ton of veggie options. Service was fast and friendly. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"This pizza joint is part of the fastest growing restaurant company in America, famously backed by Lebron James, and just opened in Summerlin. 

The dough is made in house daily, It's perfectly crispy and soft but very thin. Mine had a sprinkling with garlic salt which made the crust very tasty. They had a few vegetarian and gluten free options. I had the Art Lover Pizza which had moz and fresh ricotta cheese, artichokes, and garlic. 

The pizza reminds me of another well known pick your ingredients at the counter chain but with much better tasting ingredients. The manager I was chatting with mentioned the ingredients and pizzas are \"chef driven\" unlike other pizza chains and gave an example of one of their chefs even going out to visit the olive farm and taste the olives that produces the olive oil they use."}
{"text":"Awesome pizzas and assistant manager Luke very helpful with our party. Thank you Blaze Pizza"}
{"text":"The pizzas at Blaze are very good (if you know what you want on them) and very filling. The build-your-own pizza option is fun and gives you a tonne of choice, though I suggest not getting carried away with toppings. The pizzas are more filling than they look and the flavours don't work if you add too much on top.

The staff are friendly and helpful, but ordering can be slow because it takes people forever to figure out what they want on their pizza. After you order the food is ready quickly."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked since I first saw it on Yelp and have been super curious about it. When we went in we were immediately greeted and none of the workers seemed miserable to be there which is very refreshing. Although small it still felt spacious enough to not be sitting on your neighbors lap... Also nice. The concept of a \"subway\" for pizza had not going in there not expecting too much but I was extremely pleasantly surprised. I wanted to try the white and the red sauce so the greeter/order guy suggested I have them mix it for a pink sauce. Awesome choice, I got the white out(I think that was the name)with spinach...bacon,chopped garlic,pink sauce and mozzarella. There's was 4 of us, 2 adults and 2 kids. The kids shared a pepperoni, and husband got a half spicy half regular with onion olives and pepperoni. All the combos were great! 3-11\" pizzas 2 drinks for $25 and we all had leftovers. They also provide nutritional values for their menu and gluten free dough and vegan cheese which I think is awesome to cater to so many ppl. I do wonder about their gluten free dough, for the simple fact the kitchen was pretty small and I didn't see multiple mixers for their dough.  Worth double checking if u have an allergy. All in all my novel is done and I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Good pizza, great service, very fast! Their combos are good, or building your own is easy to do. I would watch the people making your pizza and make sure they're putting on the correct toppings. I had to correct the girl making mine twice, but she was very gracious about it. Overall great spot to eat!"}
{"text":"California Pizza Kitchen with Chipotle speed and freshness.  Pure awesomeness that will keep you coming back.  Cool management that loves customers.  Great employees/hipsters."}
{"text":"I love pizza so this place definitely hit the spot.
Got to make my own pizza for the first time and I enjoyed it.
The variety of lemonades they have is great.
Staff was super friendly.
I can never get enough of pizza so I will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was amazing! The service was fast and the pizza is delicious. I built my own pizza and I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of healthy toppings they had. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We sat outside on the patio and the busser was on it by making sure all the tables were cleaned right when people left. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Las Vegas.  I enjoy the gluten free dough option and the meat eater style.  
The mixed flavored drinks are tasty and the staff is very nice.  Thank you! 
(Decatur and 215)"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza that you can customize to your liking! Never had a problem with the quality of the pizza at all. You can't really get tired of it either because you can change it up every time! Also, their agua fresca drinks are refreshing with new flavors every couple of weeks.

My only gripe with his place is ONE worker - Maria. She doesn't like her job or something because she gives you side eye for no reason. I asked for jalapenos on the side and she, no joke, gave me a bad stare for two seconds.. what!? Girl, clean up ur attitude or get out of the food industry! 

9/10 (-1 for the girl) :D"}
{"text":"Blaze is one of my favorites; great food and even better service. Thanks Vanessa, Dani and Lucas...You guys are fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm already a regular at Blaze. Maybe once a week we'll get too lazy for food and I'll bring home two Build-your-own pizzas. 

Basically w/ the \"build your own\" you get unlimited toppings, cheese, sauce and you can ask for extra or half and half or whatever your heart desires. The ingredients are all fresh with wide variety of veggies to choose from. I find the meats don't have that smell of cheap lunch meats. The dough is thin and crispy but not like paper thin and flimsy. You can definitely get your money's worth.

I got regular red sauce with extra mozzarella, salami and italian sausage w/ red onion, black olives, mushroom, zucchini, green peppers. When I tried their spicy tomato sauce, even with reasonable tolerance for spicy food, I found it overwhelmed the flavor of the other toppings.

The staff are always so welcoming and helpful whether you're a regular or there for the first time. Service is attentive and speedy considering you're getting a pizza made from scratch."}
{"text":"Ordered online, and went in to pick it up, the pizza was ready when they said it was. I had heard a lot about this place and had been meaning to go for a while. I will say the pizza was good, it could have been very good if they added more toppings, as my pizza seemed very lacking, i ordered Gorgonzola on my pizza and i think one of the 4 slices had a tiny amount on it, the rest of the topping were there, but not in any abundance as you would find anywhere else. The crust was good, well done and nice and thin, the quality of toppings were good, but again lacking in their amounts.  It's a super busy place, so maybe their attention to detail suffers but, it could be really good pizza with a little more care. Overall i'm being picky, but this is what this is, we review things here and try to give our honest and detailed opinion, Did i like the pizza? of course, it was pretty tasty for a fast food pizza shop, would i go back? sure why not, but a few of my regular places would have to be my first option before i went here. this is a good back up though."}
{"text":"This was my go to place when I was back in Toronto, and it didn't disappoint on my trip back. A build your own unlimited topping pizza for $13 is great value for money. And the pizza is absolutely delicious - despite the line ups more often than not."}
{"text":"Thought I'd check this pizza place out since it's close to my house.  The $8.25 price for as many toppings as you like is a good deal. Pizza was good except they could have placed it in the oven for longer so the crust was a little more cooked."}
{"text":"This was our visit time visiting and we were not disappointed! The pizzas are delicious! The price is totally affordable! We all even took home leftovers. Unfortunately the power went out due to the high winds but the staff was very respectful and made sure all our needs were met. The even gave us a free pizza passes for the inconvenience for next visit. I'd recommend this place to anyone :)"}
{"text":"Went to Blaze tonight for the first time, but not the last. Every employee I interacted with was professional and friendly. The made to order pizzas were prepared & baked in no time at all. 
The main thing for me was that the restaurant was clean. No tables with leftover food or half wiped booths. I recommend Blaze to anyone wanting fast, good pizza in a friendly environment."}
{"text":"Here's what I love about Blaze: vegan cheese, lots of veggies to choose from and vegan popcorn chicken. 

We ordered out so I totally can't judge on the restaurant itself or how good the service was. My friends parents ordered for us so this is solely my opinion on the pizza itself. 

It wasn't the worst pizza I've ever had and I wouldn't even say I hated it but I found it overall kind of bland. I liked the vegan popcorn chicken but that was kinda the only part I was thrilled about. The crust is rather thin and everything else was kinda tasteless. 

I give you props for your vegan options though so well done!"}
{"text":"I came here on opening night and have been here four times since then. This place is amazing and the food is delicious. The staff is super friendly and inviting and leave me wanting to come in just to say hello. Heather, Emma and Xavier are able to greet me by name when I come in and it makes each visit that much more at home. This has easily become one of my favorite places to eat. I'll most likely be back within a week."}
{"text":"We happened upon the place by accident and knew nothing about .Just was expecting a regular pizza place .But to our surprise it was a build your own assembly line that was quick and very courteous. You your crust there all 12inch then build frim there with 5 different sauces and several different cheese s even goat cheese for those trying to loose weight there were calorie intake info on all the topping s and several healthy choice or you could go with the traditional toppings .Once it was together it only takes 3minutes in a fire oven .I highly recommend checking the place out"}
{"text":"Love that they had dairy-free cheese option! So many choices and reasonable price. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here and the crew was friendly they all worked well together. The service was fast friendly and affordable. The pizza was da bomb.com"}
{"text":"If you have any kind of gluten allergy, or celiac disease, you can come here without fear. My partner has a gluten allergy; not to the extent that it would require hospitalization, but enough to ruin an entire evening. Ophelia went out of her way to take care of us. She made sure everything came from underneath the line so there was not even a chance an ingredient had come in contact with gluten. Seriously awesome. She was as sweet as could be and deserves some major props for looking out for us. And of course the pizza was delicious. 

We have a Blaze at home in Chicago, but I'm not disappointed we went to this one. And that's saying something."}
{"text":"Convenience pizza at its finest. Do you want to pay an extra $5 to get your pizza in half the time compared to other pizzerias? For almost $12 you get a 11\" pizza with unlimited toppings on a thin crust pizza that cooks in 3 minutes, but they're quite stingy and will not pile on a lot of any one topping. Therefore, your best bet is to just ask for everything and the kitchen sink. Yes, your dream 30+ topping pizza can be a reality here!

Ordered one of the presets: a BBQ chicken pizza. They didn't have banana peppers in stock so I substituted onions instead. Had to request additional mozzarella cheese because they didn't put on enough initially.

Service was nice, but I think they overdid it. They call out your name and ask multiple times about how you feel and if you are satisfied with your order. I know some people love being pampered like this, but it felt a little uncomfortable especially because instead of one person making my pizza, it was done assembly-line style where the pizza was handed off to multiple people down the line. The employees were into it because it was their second day on the job, but we'll see if that enthusiasm remains a year or so later.

If you are very hungry, this won't satisfy you unless you added 10+ toppings. The pizza is quite small. Despite it being 11\", it's so thin that it eats like an 8\" pizza. If you want to fill yourself, you may as well go to the Eaton Centre. It's good if you have extra money to burn and are watching your calorie count, since everything has a calorie count listed. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my pizza and will try this place again sometime."}
{"text":"\"Make-it-yourself and we'll bake it in seconds!\" pizza spots are popping up everywhere. This is a version I actually enjoyed! Crisp, chewy crust with a variety of quality toppings (goat cheese, gorgonzola, fresh basil, minced garlic), ready super-fast with great service, for a low price (under $8/each) and sized large enough to have a couple of pieces leftover.

On opening day, they were super busy but every employee was peppy and positive. In addition to the pizzas, they also have some small salads and desserts (ask for the s'mores to be heated in the oven!).  Highly recommend adding pesto drizzle to your creation after it bakes, a vibrant and flavorful version generously applied."}
{"text":"I would give them zero stars if I could. Horrible customer service! We ordered and paid online, it said it would be ready at the same time we arrived to pick it up, had to wait for anyone to acknowledge me, then told they didn't have it, and only made 3 of the 4 items we ordered and paid for. After waiting almost 45 min, finally got the order and it was cold. No apologies, discounts or acknowledgement. When asked where the other pizza was that we ordered, was told it would be another 30 min due to the line in the store. This is the SECOND time we have had same experience when ordering online...and will never return."}
{"text":"bruh this is THE best place to get pizza i literally ate the whole pizza in 3 seconds. I got the personalized pizza (for $12??) with the hot sauce and spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, banana peppers and i forget what else. The hot sauce is BOMB. Best part is that they have vegan cheese available!!!! It tasted really amazing and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had. Period. 
I am not a big fan of pizza but I came across this pizza at work. I had the Red Vine and it was delishhhhhj. Soooo darn good! This will be my pizza joint frim now on :)"}
{"text":"We just tried blaze pizza for the first time today I wish we would've tried it sooner!!!! My whole group was thoroughly impressed with the quality of food number of toppings friendly and attentive staff we will definitely be coming here again and very often at that!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Tried it for the first time a few days ago, everyone is super nice, a lot of vegan options! Super nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Pizzas are great but the staff is even better! Taylor and Shorty were exceptionally friendly and helpful!! Amazing customer service which is hard to come by these days!! Will definitely be coming back to this place! Such a great value for what you get and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I hate thin crust pizza and every one of these fast cook pizza places features the thinnest crust possible. The only one that offers a thicker option is the High-Rise pizza dough here at Blaze for $2 more. It does make a huge difference in the taste and quality in my opinion. I think I got almost every veggie available and added a few shots of ricotta all for the price of $8.65 (plus the 2 bucks). You should be able to get two meals out of this pie if you are taking it home, so the price is right and it's a decent pie (for this category of pizza) with the thicker dough. Props for offering this option."}
{"text":"My friend suggested Blaze Pizza before our movie at Yonge-Dundas and the moment he said ' you can add as many toppings as you want for free' I was hooked. 

When I walked up to the counter I was greeted by a friendly staff member who asked me if I had ever been here before. When I said no, she proceeded to explain how I order, my options etc.  For the indecisive they have signature pizzas you  can choose from like the Meat Eater, Veg Out, BBQ Chicken, or you can go completely rogue and build your own pizza using their selection of meats, cheeses, veggies and sauces. I opted to start out with one of their signature pizzas - the Veg, with half/half sauce then I added a slew of other toppings to create my delicious masterpiece. All the build your own pizzas cost $10.45 regardless of how many toppings you add. 

I waited about 10 minutes after I ordered and paid and the pizza was ready! The pizza was quite good, with a thin crust which I really enjoy, and they also have a wall of hot sauces on the side so customers can help themselves. I have to say the staff are also very attentive and make a good effort to clean up tables as soon as possible. 

Blaze is a great concept and I can see why it's so popular. I would definitely return with friends and see where my pizza creating abilities take me."}
{"text":"I first came here for a Yelp event. The people who work here are very nice, I've been back twice since. I like the fact that they have so many options for toppings. I especially like the goat cheese. I also like that they have different meat options as well...turkey meatballs! Everything is so fresh and just Yummy!

Oh! The blood orange lemonade...GET IT!"}
{"text":"So tasty! Not too heavy! Plenty of options! Very accommodating! Fantastic customer service! Well done Blaze Crew!"}
{"text":"Fast food pizza joint. It's quick. You create your own pizza or choose from their choice. Recommend the spicy red sauce- spot on.  Lot the thin crispy crust. Fyi. They have Vegan selection as well. Love the lemonade.  Smores is perfect ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Our first time here definitely will not be our last their pizza is absolutely delicious . The place is super clean the whole experience is awesome never have ordered pizza this way before. The staff is super friendly and super reasonable prices and top-quality food."}
{"text":"This place has been open for a little over a week, and I happened to notice it while driving in the area.

The store itself is very nice.  What i loved was the fact that the seating is spaced out very well.  The easily could have crammed in more seats, but it was really open.

When you walk up there is a list of potential pizzas as well as toppings.  Similar to a Chipotle you then go down the line and build your pizza.  I tired a couple sauces.  I enjoyed the red sauce, which was slightly sweet.  They also had a spicier sauce which I honestly was not a fan of.  I liked the heat, but whatever they use to cause the heat did not work with me.

After having our pizza built about five minutes later they were ready to eat.  Decent sized pie for $6.99.  Loved it was a thiner crust, and did taste incredibly fresh.  I certainly look forward to visiting again, and trying their cheese sauces as a pizza base.

This is a wonderful concept and would be amazed if even more do not spring up."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza.  This location is pretty new, so the line was practically out the door.  The atmosphere of the venue is pretty cool, and the food was good.  Hopefully the rush will die down after they are there for a while.  Saturday afternoon at 12:30pm probably wasn't my best decision, but a guy's gotta eat!  Will def go back."}
{"text":"This is my family's first time here. We've been to other make-it-yourself places, but not Blaze. I had the White Top pizza and it was phenomenal! The only thing that was confusing is how to order. It's not clear whether you can order unlimited toppings or not. My family figured it out and all was good."}
{"text":"It's like chipotle but with pizza! I think I may have died and gone to heaven. $8 for more than enough (never thought I'd say that) pizza with unlimited build your own toppings! They have everything from pesto base, turkey meatballs to feta cheese & artichokes, plus all your basics of course! 

Pizzas (2 byo) took no more than 6 min to come out. Could've been less I wasn't counting but I was surprised at how quickly it came out! Crust is super thin and perfectly crispy. 

Every single employee we interacted with was SO friendly and patient with us (my boyfriend is one of THOSE guys who got like everything on his pizza) and super informing about every question we asked! Wish I would've gotten the guy's name who helped us at the beginning of the line, he explained everything to us thoroughly and that definitely helped us a lot! We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and very friendly service. You get to top your pizza with whatever ingredients they have. Be warned.. line up can be crazy at times!

Quality: 8.5/10. Service 8.5/10. Value: 8/10. Overall: 8.5/10 (Not an average)."}
{"text":"So I cannot say how excited I was to see Blaze out here in Charlotte! It was our favorite place to eat while in L.A. and it lived up to my memory! I love create your own pizza joints. I love the spicy marinara sauce the best but also like the cream mixed with the pesto. Go build your own or order one of their specials!

Oh, don't forget to get the blood orange lemonade! You'll be addicted!"}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest Blaze chain I have ever went! It literally took 10 minutes to receive my pizza when there was only one person in front of me. Usually they take 5 minutes or less even when it is jam packed at other places.
They really do take their time to do add toppings and what not. 
I'm usually a huge fan of Blaze, but I might reconsider coming to this location again. I usually pretty patient with my food, but it took way too long."}
{"text":"Clean environment and modern environment. Slow and uncoordinated staff. Dry and sub-par pizza - that made us feel sick

Biggest issue: should train staff to change gloves when someone mentions they are vegetarian/gluten-free/etc. 

We asked the employee to change gloves then another employee is questioning his coworker why she changed gloves and for who...."}
{"text":"Fabulous find! Split a pizza - with the thinnest crust I've ever seen! - with my wife and found it tantalizingly delicious! A definite on the places to eat downtown!"}
{"text":"Wow you guys really did it this time!! I've been here about 4 times now and every time outstanding guest service. Greeted from start to finish, asked if this is enough/is this pizza okay because it's a little burnt on the ends? Really? Thanks for for all of that. Management has put together a great team they are sincere and they run like an well oiled machine."}
{"text":"If think you're tired of eating pizza because you always go to Pizza Hut or dominoes or Little Caesars, well this place is different. Because it doesn't taste like any of them try it you'll like it! Or love it

Oh and the $2.00 Smore's cookie is really good"}
{"text":"SO YUMMY. I've been anticipating their grand opening for a couple weeks now, and they definitely did not disappoint me.  I got a couple of free pizza coupons because I work next door at Firehouse Subs, so naturally went in for pizza right away. I was amazed at how elegant and beautiful the inside was! All the staff seemed super eager and friendly, and was more than happy to walk me through their process. I ended up getting a 11' make your own pizza, with white sauce and all their cheeses (Mozz, Parm, Feta, Gorgonzola, and Goat I believe) honestly, one of the best pizzas I've ever had, crispy, chewy crust, and the cheeses all taste so fresh! Also got a cute little smores pie for dessert. Will be back!:)"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Good prices. The appeal here is that all pizza is the same price regardless of toppings...and it's quick. The salads were just okay. Blood orange lemonade and s'mores were awesome!"}
{"text":"Love blaze pizza and never get a chance to come by. I decided to place an online order for the first time and just pop in and grab it before going to the mall. I placed my order at 11AM and it confirmed my pizzas would be ready at 11:16AM. I arrived at 11:15 and waited for a big group to check out. About 11:25 I asked about my pizzas only to find out that they weren't in the oven and hadn't even been made. My mom and 10 month old were waiting in the car so I didn't have time to wait another 20 min for our pizzas. So frustrated. They said they were understaffed but I put my order in so it would pop up right when they opened and they need to learn to work in carry out orders with their regular orders. A girl behind me had the same issue with her carry out and said the other location never did that. I couldn't stay and wait around for the big group and then finally my pizza to come out so I asked for a refund. Just so bummed :("}
{"text":"The Pizza here is awesome! Service by Emma was excellent, took her time and made sure that my pizza was perfect before moving on with ingredients. Always coming back here to get Pizza from the team at Blaze!"}

{"text":"Unique concept.  Good pizza. Loudest restaurant I've ever eaten in. It's all concrete and glass no sound absorption.  You can't have a conversation or hear the staff to place an order.  No liquor license yet but a bottle or draft beer is listed at $5!!!  It's kinda like a Moes but for pizza."}

This place is amazing. At $10.45 for a custom pizza with unlimited toppings, I have nothing to complain about. That's what I got: the build-your-own. (http://www.blazepizza.com/menu/build-your-own)

You know how places with unlimited anything are often stingy and wait for you to pick what you want so they know how much you plan on ordering and how little they'll give you? This place is NOT like that. It truly is unlimited.

I picked three cheeses. They asked, \"Do you want any more cheese?\"

I picked three meats. They asked, \"Do you want any more meats?\"

I picked six veggies. They asked, \"Do you want any more toppings?\"

And all of that with a smile. 

Original red sauce, mozzarella, ovalini mozzarella, feta,  italian sausage, pepperoni, applewood bacon, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, roasted garlic, cherry tomatoes, sautéed onions, spinach. 

12 toppings (not including the sauce).

I already had a drink, so I didn't buy one, but with a drink, it comes to $14. Next time, I would consider it because it's refillable and they even have lemonade and blood orange lemonade. 

There are a few people working the assembly line, kind of like Chipotle, so it's a really quick process and after maybe five minutes in the oven, you get your hot delicious pizza.

I would definitely come back. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"Very fast and efficient ordering. Kind of reminds me of chipotle but for pizza. Everyone that works there was really friendly.  You get to pick as many toppings as you want for one price which is really nice.  Their standard pizza crust is thin but you can choose to get a thicker crust at an additional charge but the thin is really good.  I got them to put different toppings on each half of a pizza.  One one side was bacon, goat cheese and arugula, and on the other half was italian sausage, kalamata olives, mushroom, artichoke and arugula.  So tasty!!!  It only took 3 minutes to bake!  Delicious!!!  A really good choice for pizza when in Yonge/Dundas area."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good but calling the experience fast is an overstatement. I was third in line and it took 22 minutes from walking in to them actually finishing putting the toppings on my pizza. 3

The employees are young (high school age) which accounts for some of this but it was the most dysfunctional operation I have seen. One manager on site and she could not handle getting everyone in line. No body wanted to work apparently because at one point, we all stood for 5 minutes while not a single pizza was prepared. Everyone seemed to think someone else would just do the job for them. It was more so just kids joking around and not working while the manager was in the back. 

While waiting, they started one pizza for the two of us then chose to line up 7 online orders before our second pizza. So being the second pizza on the order, I had to wait 20 minutes after the first was already done before mine was completed. So my girlfriend had to sit at a table watching her pizza get cold while I waited on mine. 

They need to work on training employees so they know what to do without being guided every step of the way."}
{"text":"I've been her twice and on both occasions ordered the build your own pizza. The service is good as well as the food."}
{"text":"I would say this is pretty much like any other make our own pizza place that is hot right now (mod pizza, fired pie). 

I got the build your own with chicken, artichokes, and BBQ sauce. The taste was there but the dough was a little too soggy for me. These places either over do and burn the crust a little, or seem to not cook it quite enough. 

I do like the fact that they offer gluten free crust and non dairy cheese. 

also, be sure to check out their drinks and lemonade. they're made in house and look pretty fresh."}
{"text":"I am loving these BYO places that are popping up all over. Blaze has a simple concept; one pizza, one size, unlimited toppings. Of course you could choose one of their signature items, but I like to make my own. It's more fun that way.

I chose a regular crust pizza and got no sauce. I added mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, tomatoes, artichoke, and ricotta cheese. Then when the pizza came out of the oven, I had them drizzle some olive oil over the top. Simple yet delicious. My boyfriend heard unlimited toppings and went crazy. He got the high rise pizza dough which is thicker crust, and then added tons of cheese, and almost all the meats they had. He also got extra cheese. Don't be afraid to ask for more toppings. They only give you a handful of the toppings you ask for, but you can always ask for more. 

They say the pizzas take about 190 seconds or around 3 minutes to cook, but his took a little longer because of the mountain of toppings he had. One thing I can say is I saw some of the pizzas come out of the oven looking like shit. Some of them got stuck to the pans, and I saw one dude scrape off cheese and toppings and put it back on the pizza. I'm glad that wasn't my pie. I would make sure to keep an eye on them when they come out the oven though. 

I was just about to pay and leave when I saw their premade salads next to the register. I chose the berry arugula salad and it was bomb. It had fresh blackberries, creamy goat cheese, and peppery arugula tossed in some type of balsamic vinaigrette. I wished I had gotten more than just a single serving. It's safe to say I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Pizza is that meal I end up eating when I am lazy to cook and dont feel like Chinese. Going to be honest though Chinese normally wins over pizza. But after trying out Blaze Pizza I am starting to reconsider. 

Was lucky enough to attend an Yelp Elite event at Blaze which gave me a great opportunity to try more items than I normally would have.

Lets start with the drink selection. All the regular fountain drinks and then they have 2 types of lemonade - regular and blood orange lemonade. The blood orange is just delightful and all I felt like drinking for the next few days.

Then there are the pizza's. Thin crust (yes please!) or thick crust (about double the size of the thin) and a lovely gluten-free option that stayed nice and crisp and held up well from what I saw. You can choose on of their delicious selections or choose to create your own - both for the same price of $10.45. Choose your sauce, and cheese, and meats, and veggies, and garnishes, and drizzles once its been baked. So many combinations and so little time!

With the advise of 5-9 topping so things don't get all soggy and everything cooks, made my decision and went to work. Chose to do a white sauce with pesto sauce around the crust - this is a must as gives the crust delicious flavour so you don't waste it at the end. Topped with mozza + goat cheese + LOTS of bacon + chicken + mushrooms + sauted onions + basil + chopped garlic + oregano + salt. That was baked up in their incredibly hot fast cooking oven. Topped that with arugula. Heaven! 

Grabbed a side salad of roast veg and Gorgonzola. Yum! Great dressing that was flavorful but not too oily.

Of course we tried the smore pie for dessert - good thickness digestive biscuits on either side with chocolate and a marshmallow in between. Just warmed up on the edge of the oven until everything melted together in a delightful more-ish bite. This is the best end to a pizza dinner ever.

I will absolutely be back. I have all these ideas and combinations I would love to try. The staff are unbelievably friendly and helpful. But best of all it doesn't cost me an extra $3 if I want to add mushroom to my pizza.

They will soon open their location in Mission on 4th Street and that will have a liquor licence. Blaze you have my heart."}
{"text":"I got one of their signature pizzas, the White Top. It comes with white sauce, bacon, arugula, garlic and oregano. I found the toppings to be so sparse and overall a bit tasteless (see photo). I'm new to this place, and having read other reviews, maybe I should've gone with their 'build your own' option. For $12.85 I expected so much more. 

Don't pick this one off the menu, folks!"}
{"text":"I was looking for an inexpensive place to take my daughter for lunch and what I found was so much more! I discovered a brand new trendy casual place place that is kind of like subway in the way you tell them how to make your pizza. The atmosphere and severs were very inviting. Asiaan, Kona and Bry , the pizza makers, greeted me as I entered and were very informative about the menu. Bry was my favorite. Kona rung me up and was very helpful and patient with me. Thanks guys! Lastly, Don, another guy who's name I didn't get and Deshuan, the servers were sweethearts. The place is trendy, clean and has a spacious lower level for seating."}
{"text":"This concept is amazing! Why didn't anyone thnj of this before? Customizable unlimited toppings thin crust pizza! 

They have so many toppings, whatever you would want on a pizza! The crust is nice and thin a little crispy a little chewy, just the way I like it! The size is just perfect for me and for unlimited toppings the price is alright too. I really love this concept because the preset pizzas always has something I don't like and I always want to switch it out for something else without having to pay for extra toppings. Now I can just put whatever I want on the pizza for one set price! 

Service was great, nice and fast the staff generally were courteous. System was good they write your name on it and call you when it's done. The only thing I don't like was that they only put a little bit of the toppings on each time but I think  that's to prevent people from over ordering. But if you only want two or three toppings in total you would want more of each. I wish you can just tell them like I want 3x the normal amount of mushrooms and not having to tell them more more more. 

This is a fast food joint so you get your own food and bring to table etc. The place was nice and clean and was a quick in and out of delicious pizza."}

{"text":"Oh my god! The pizzas here are out of this world.. Other than the fact of the unlimited toppings.. The dough is delicious! 
You will love this place for sure, I can guarantee that! 
Also they have a convenient option of you ordering online.. they will prepare your order for you and then you go to the store, pay at the Cashier and that's when they will throw it in the oven..
So guaranteed delicious and hooooootttt!"}

{"text":"If you're in the mood for some quality pizza, the freedom to customize it however you want, and to experience great customer service, please come to Blaze.

The wait is never too long here although it may get a tad bit busy around noon time during lunch. The workers always greet you upon entrance and I have yet to meet a grouchy associate. 

The set-up is similar to chipotle. You order in an assembly line whilst picking and choosing all of the yummy ingredients to put on your pizza. I always get the regular dough and original red sauce to start off. Although I hear the white cream sauce is a great substitute if you're wanting to try something other than red. And then you just go down the line and customize your perfect little pizza. It's fired up at the end and it takes less than 10 mins for it to come out usually.

The drinks (specifically, different types of lemonades) and the desserts (which can be warmed up upon request) are a must!"}
{"text":"Came back after that first disappointing experience, and it seems like Blaze has finally smoothed out its rough edges. Toppings were plentiful, service was friendly, and I wasn't scolded for wanting lots of cheese. Glad Blaze exists, because their GF crust is miles better than Famoso's."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the Decatur location since they opened. What started out as a great experience has gone drastically down hill.  There seems to be no oversight at this location. Just a bunch of kids throwing pizzas together as fast as they can. The pizzas are sloppily made and and ingredients wasted. My pizza today a big chunk of the edge was missing as it came out of the press. The pizzas still taste great but the over all experience is not what I would expect it to be.  I seem to get a better experience at the Durango location."}
{"text":"When it comes to pizza, I always want to have thin crust.
I'm also a little picky when it comes to pizza toppings because I want to make sure that the place where I'm getting my food is making healthy and conscentious choices about the places where the ingredients are coming from.
In few words: I want my items coming from a free hormones, no GMO, environmentally friendly farms and cultivations.
Crunchy crust, delicious tomato sauce and thin crust: turns out that despite Blaze Pizza is a chain pizzeria, it'll definitely be one of my fav spot in town.

I've ordered a regular pizza with all the topping of my choice: fresh mozzarella, gorgonzola cheese, caramelized onions, mushrooms and basil leafs.
Result: pizza was ready to be put in the oven in less than 2 minutes and cooked in less than 3. And the flavour was simply AMAZING.

The service is good, quick and easy. The staff is very friendly and willing to guide you how to choose and \"build\" your own pizza.
Restroom are clean and the location is great since is literally downtown right next door to the theatre and the Dundas square station.

For a regular pizza with a total of 6 slices, it was $10.75.
For the quality received and the service, this is a very reasonalbe price that is hard to beat.

Can't wait to try more options!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Blaze since we had a BOGO flyer.
The start of the experience was pleasant the staff were very friendly. However, once we paid had waited 5 minutes to get our pizza after it was out is where it started to go downhill. No fault of her own the poor cashier was having to box pizza and keep up with the the growing line that came in. Once I got my pizza it was warm, but the worst part was it was completely burnt on the bottom. The one star is for remaking the pizza which still burnt but better than the 1st.  When my concerns were passed on to who appears to be the manager and all he could do is  shrug his shoulders as he could care less. This is where I decided I will not be back at Blaze."}
{"text":"Things like \"good pizza\" and \"located in Canada\" are not typically found together, at least not coming from a Western New Yorker. In fact, I gave my husband a hard time when he told me we were headed to a pizza spot mid-event in Toronto. He defended his honor of course by stating Yelp says it's the best. 

So we went...for pizza...across the border. And I have to hand it to my fellow Yelpers because this place was the bomb dot com. Great music, friendly and accomodating staff, overall, great atmosphere. There are several in house pizza's to choose from, of which my group of three shared two. Patrons are also offered the option to create their own pizza. The two we enjoyed were not at all disappointing. In fact, I typically detest thin crust but these slices had something special to them, because I ate three slices and easily could have kept going (if there was more time to do so and space between my waistline). Ricotta, fresh clumps, yes...CLUMPS of delicious cheese...wood fired...if really is something to try.

So, if our have ever had pizza in Canada and realized they just don't know how to do it right..try this place when you are scoping out the wonders of downtown Toronto. If you enjoy the pizza on a regular..Definitely try this place to find what you have been missing and your taste buds will be forever thankful!"}
{"text":"An awesome addition to the city in an already booming part of south end. While the general concept for these quick and casual custom pizza places are the same, Blaze executes the concept very well. The gist is you make your own pizza (or choose from some pre-selected starters), pick out as many toppings as you want (all included - no price changes if you pick 2 or 20), and then they cook it in front of you. The result is a custom made pie with whatever you want - no more group arguments about toppings - all for under $10. A pretty good deal if you ask me. In addition, all the toppings I've tried have been fresh and tasty. The biggest issue is deciding under the gun what topping you want on your pizza. Pro tip - don't overload it. It's an easy thing to do, but just do what I do and come back for another pizza at a later date."}
{"text":"Love the crust!! Thin crust but oddly satisfying and delicious as I'm not usually one to order a thin crust. Not \"Grimmaldi's\" type of crust either which is paper thin and like a cracker. It holds the weight of the pizza, which they fire up in their open-display ovens. Have red pepper flakes, oregano, and sriracha on the side for you to grab and they also have agua frescas!! Loved the fresh ingredients and their signature pizzas are really thought out to make for some really delicious pizzas. Tried 2 different pizzas and a heated up brownie for dessert. Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Fast Fired? More like slow and burnt.  There wasn't a large line when I walked in but it still took 10+ mins to order and pay. An additional 5 mins to cook.

I've been to many of these personal pizza places and I wasn't impressed with blaze. First, most places allow you to add unlimited topping for a standard price. Not here. Avg $8.50 per pizza for more then 2 toppings. 

I got the bbq pizza and it was okay. The bbq sauce was runny and not my favorite. Now let's talk about the crust. Mine came out black and burnt. See photo.

The only good part was the $3 draft beer. They had 3 drafts, two of them Four Peaks beers."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat excellent pizza. The employees are great and definitely make you feel welcomed and I love that each of them refer to you by your name. The pizza is very delicious and the toppings are endless. The prices are very reasonable."}

{"text":"Great pizza built to exactly as you want. Very helpful friendly team. Very quick, your pizza is cooked to perfection within a couple minutes."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome pizza, make it how you want for 8 bucks. Couldn't ask for better dinner idea fun. Can't wait to come back!! Love the s'mores cookie!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of these 'DIY' pizza places. As someone who doesn't eat cheese, this gives me an opportunity to enjoy fresh baked pizza with all of my favorite toppings. 

Was on my way home a couple weeks ago and decided to stop at Blaze. Was super impressed!

The dough is fresh and thicker than most of the competitor DIY pizza spots. The toppings were all fresh and the staff friendly. 

Luckily this is the closest one of these spots to my house. I'll definitely be back. It was the best in class from my experience. Definitely give it a shot!"}
{"text":"The pizzas are incredible when the staff has their games faces on. I find that depending on the day and time you visit your pizza will drastically differ in toppings and cleanliness. That being said, I am a frequent customer and will continue to be. It's like a subway for pizza and I really do enjoy the pizza. $8 for a fully loaded pizza.... can't be that. 

I have seen some cross contamination with spoons being used in multiple toppings though. Not alarming to me with no allergies, but to others this could be a serious problem.

{"text":"We're back on the HUNT for Toronto's BEST! Stop #7 on the pizza pie tour: Blaze Fast Fire'd Pizza

As we near the end of the hunt, we headed for the heavily touted Blaze Pizza, in the heart of Toronto at Yonge and Dundas. As you step into the restaurant, you get a sense of the casual feel, which is extended by their welcoming and helpful staff. If you're unaware of how ordering from Blaze works, they'll let you know that you can load your pie with whatever assortment of toppings that you would like, for no extra fee. If you're like me, and are exhausted by the prospect of having to devise your own pie, thankfully you can pick from their signature list. The cherry on top is that, as the name suggests, the pies are prepared in minutes in their sizeable oven.

We ordered two pies; the Link In and the Red Vine. The Link In comes with Italian sausage, roasted red peppers, sautéed onions, mozzarella, and marinara, and I added black olives, mushrooms, and bacon bits. The Red Vine comes with mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, parmesan, basil marinara, and olive oil drizzle, and my friend added roasted red peppers and mushrooms. Starting with the crusts, they were the thinnest amoung all of the restaurants that we've visited yet, which isn't good or bad; just a fact. The Link In was pretty alright, and had no features that I can necessarily complain about. The Red Vine was a little more eventful, lead by the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes, then light basil flavour.
If it's not yet clear, my enthusiasm about Blaze is low. This is not to say that I disliked Blaze in any way, but the lack of vibrant flavours relative to most of the other spots in the hunt, and its overhyped ratings didn't sway me. By the end of it, we both agreed that Blaze is more of good to great fast food pizza rather than a high quality pizzeria.

Head over to Blaze to satisfy your inner pizzaiolo, and grab a pie made on the double. Just don't expect tastegasms."}

Post baking - added pesto drizzle and arugula.
Can't wait to try other toppings next time!"}

{"text":"Tried blaze pizza for the first time.

They offer some signature pizzas, but for an extra dollar or two you can build-your-own which allows you to choose any toppings you want on your pizza. They have 4 sauces, 10 different cheeses, 8 different meats, and a dozen or so vegetables to choose from. That is correct, unlimited toppings on your pizza.

I like the overall process that they use to order a pizza, check-out and hand over to the customer. Very smooth, and each employee is focused on a specific task so no time wasted moving back and forth.

However, everything was just so salty. I don't know which ingredients specifically were salty since I had basically asked to have everything on it (minus the sea salt), but it was definitely a very salty pizza, probably even saltier than what I've had from other pizza shops. Given the location, there are so many options to choose from if your lunch budget is $10+

I think it's a great deal, but it's not somewhere that I would go for a pizza simply because of the tongue-numbing experience afterwards."}

that you will crave after tasting it once. They have A LOT of toppings to choose from that you usually don't get anywhere else. And its a reasonable price too, just $10! I usually save half for later since im so full so its definitely enough for left overs. They were handing out coupons for BOGO when they first opened and I got two pizzas for 10 dollars which was such a great deal for such a great tasting pizza. Its MUCH better than Coco Brooks.

{"text":"A Co-worker of mine had mentioned this place and I thought that I would give it a try during lunch, I'm glad I did.  

At first glance when I walked in, I felt it out to be a more upscale option for fast food pizza.  Everything was clean, organized, and stocked.  So I set out to order, and decided upon the build your own pizza option.   

Throughout ordering and deciding on what toppings to get, my pizza creator (which I forgot her name) advised me on flavours that worked well together and how much.   She seemed very knowledgeable.  I would ask for a topping, to which she would place a bunch on the pizza, and looking down at the pizza it seemed like a very small amount to me.  She made it very clear to me that if I chose more, I could certainly have more, but with specific items she would advise against it, adding that it would be overpowering and unbalanced.  This is where I can see that other users have gotten the \"stingy on the toppings\" vibe.  But in my case, it was a blessing, as I certainly would have overdone it.  I chose to trust her instincts and what I got was a perfectly balanced, delicious pizza.  I could taste all the toppings, nothing overpowered, nothing hidden in the flavour.  It was pretty much a perfect pizza.  

As I was eating I noticed just how thin the crust was, but it was not at all soggy from being paper thin.  Eating the whole individual sized pizza was just the perfect amount.  I left feeling satisfied, not overly stuffed as I usually am after a good meal. 

All in all, next time I'm in the area, I'll be checking it out again to see if they can repeat that performance."}

{"text":"#155

My first trip was a recommendation by Al C. since on 14 March, all pizzas were $3.14 for Pi day (NERD!).

I figured what the hell, it's a cheap meal.

I got there around 7pm or so; I waited literally for an hour from the tree outside to the counter to actually order pizza.

Preface:

I HATE THIN CRUST PIZZA!

Of course, when I get there, I find out that's all they have. So, it's not looking pretty but damn, the pizza sure does smell good.

While waiting in line, several of the employees were explaining about their app which you can order on, then pick up as well as how the line works and such. They even offered water if you were thirsty.

Apparently, as I found out on my 2nd trip, many of them got training in the LA office since the company requires 3-5 members have that \"special training\". The owner of Five Guys Canada owns the rights to Blaze in Canada (both are US based chains of high quality).

Now, I'm used to being told that you only get two toppings and any more is extra.

No, No, No, No, that's not how they dough it here! They told me, it's unlimited toppings at no extra charge!! That's worth the drive alone as most places charge $2 to $3 for each extra topping so my pizza would be $12 to $18 more if they did that here (that makes up for the drive though a new location is opening in April at 2020 4th St SW down the street from my house... DOUGH! Sweet DOUGH!).

So, with this knowledge of how it doughs for the toppings, I proceeded to build my own (think Subway but higher quality fixin's and for pizza and now you get how it doughs).

I got a double helping of the spicy red sauce (and people, it AIN'T white people spicy; this spice kicks it like it's hawt), green and red peppers, red onions, tomatoes, spinach leaves, mozzarella, pepperoni, and chicken (all these veggies are known to be very liver friendly so if you have liver disease or liver problems, load up on these; also spices are good for your liver like cinnamon and tomato based spices).

As was on the first trip, the service was just awesome. Fast, friendly, and with a smile (and it wasn't as busy as Pi day; how they kept such a good attitude with that kind of line is beyond me but the customers I saw that day were pretty awesome)!

By the way, I hope they get some sugar based sodas soon because the glucose-fructose Coca-Cola and other just ruin it but they have two flavours of lemonade (sugar based), regular and blood orange! Jolly bloody good, mates!

Oh, and the crust, pure DIVINITY.. perfectly toasted and light but supports the weight of 8 toppings (verified!).

Oh yeah, it's like 3 minutes for your damn pizza, can you beat that?

So, I waited until my second trip on Saturday, 20 March to see the regular price of $10.45 + shipping/handling (tax) to write my review. I wanted to see if the first time was a fluke; you never know with these \"fast food\" chains how it doughs the 2nd time around.

Summary: unlimited toppings, set price, three minutes, get pizza, get happy, get home"}
{"text":"Hands down 5 stars for the name! It was funny telling the guy starting my order that my name was Blaze... he took a bit of a double take.  It's worth noting that everyone here seemed very happy and willing to help- obviously this team was trained very well!

This place is cool, definitely a unique concept. It's similar to a subway, but with pizza. You choose your crust (regular, thick, or gluten free) and then you either choose one of their recipes or you choose your own toppings. You can get unlimited toppings on your personal pizza and it only costs about 8 dollars. Once your done selecting toppings, they \"fast fire\" the pizza in the oven for 3 minutes, very quick... while I was paying, my order was already in the oven, and after I filled my drink it was done. They also have salads and desserts, I didn't try these, but they looked very good. 

Was the pizza the best I've ever had? No... but it certainly wasn't bad. I'd like to try the thicker crust next time. The thin crust wasn't crispy like you'd usually expect... but rather kind of mushy.  Still good, just not for everybody. The topping selection was great (so much to choose from), but the taste of those toppings wasn't really anything to rave about. Again, not bad at all, just not the best. 

They have a wide variety of artisan type drinks, lemonades, sodas, etc. I liked their tea and I also tried one of their fruit beverages... both very good. 

Overall, I would certainly recommend giving this place a try... the pizza was good... and you might even love this places unique culinary style. If not, you'll certainly love the concept, atmosphere, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've had a chance to experience Blaze multiple times within the past few weeks and I'm ready to give Blaze my official stamp of approval.  Here's everything you need to know BLAZE...

Food/Pizza:  Let's start with their claim to fame - the pizza!!  As opposed to one of the Signature Pizza options, I usually go with the \"Build Your Own\".  They offer a few different crust options - a traditional/thin-crust, a high rise and gluten-free options - I prefer the thin crust.  I like the \"Build Your Own\" option because you can add unlimited toppings for no extra charge, so why not take advantage!?!  I like to go with the mozzarella (extra mozz), feta, and parmesan cheeses, that's right 3 different cheeses! I then add pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms, and whatever else I'm in the mood for on that particular day.  After they throw your pie into one of their blazing hot ovens for 90 seconds, be sure to take advantage of the finishing sauces they offer - I love a drizzle of olive oil to finish my pizza off juuust right!  The pizza tastes amazing friends.  All the toppings taste and look fresh.  Due to the flexibility and  bounty of options available, if you're unhappy with your pie, I'm sorry, but its your own fault.

Don't want to \"Build Your Own\"?  No worries, they have plenty of signature pizzas to choose from as well. My personal favorite is the \"White Top\" (add chicken).

I can't speak to the salads or deserts but I'd like to recommend this berry-lemonade they have.  As far as beverages go, its an awesome, summery, non-soda option.  

Service:  The service has always been super chill every time I've been to Blaze.  Employees are mostly younger, early 20s, friendly, and willing to strike-up a convo without hesitation.  

Parking:  Parking can sometimes be an issue at this Blaze location - depends what time you are going.  There's no parking lot exclusively for Blaze's patrons, however there is plenty of street parking available - get in where you fit in.  

Ambiance/Interior:  My first time here I was struck by how open and expansive the interior is.  There's plenty of high-top tables near the ordering area to sit at.  There's also another section down a few steps with a bunch of tables.  I will say, sometimes it feels like a heard of buffalo just ran through the joint - the tables need to be cleaned, the floors swept, etc.  Although, that could simply be a product of the high number of patrons that come thru Blaze daily.   

No complaints here.  This was an easy 5-stars for me.  

BLAZE ON!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza at a great price. Fun atmosphere and super quick.  You instruct them exactly how to make your perfect pizza. Healthy toppings!  Love the spinach!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the pizza from Blaze. Ordered online and then arrived to pick it up. Didn't have to wait in line and went directly to the cashier to pay and to get my order freshly cooked. About 6 minutes later and our 3 pizzas were done. Perfect size pizzas for an individual to eat. And the topics were good. I like that fact that you can pick the items you want and then they cool it, and they don't charge you extra for the toppings. Pizza was really good!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite pizza place in the gta. For the price and what you get, this is totally worth it. The build your own pizza with unlimited toppings for just under $12 before tax is such a steal. 

After trial and error, I now order the original which is thin crust with red sauce mixed with pesto. I top it with double italian sausage, mozzarella and ricotta cheese, red onions and mushrooms and then finish it off with bbq sauce and arugula. The more toppings you add, the soggier your pizza will be.

The pizza cooks in just 3 minutes and comes out perfectly cooked and light with a crispy crust. If this were closer to work, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Wish I would have tried this place earlier.  My first visit was a few weeks before the semester ended.  My friend and I stopped in lunch between classes.  Everything looked so good, it was hard to decide.  We decided to split a pizza so we could try a salad as well.  We got the Green Stripe Pizza and it was amazing!  We also couldn't pass up dessert.  We both got the brownie and I'm telling you that just writing about the brownie makes me want to drive the 30 minutes to get one right now!  I got my brownie heated up.  It's was all warm and gooey!

We decided to go back the last week of school.  We again decided to split a pizza because the salads are so good.  We decided to get a salami pizza because it reminded me of my favorite pizza I would get when I lived in Germany.  It was just like being back in Europe!  We wanted to try the s'more pie, but that brownie is too hard to pass!"}
{"text":"I just absolutely love this place. Basically a Subway for Pizza. 

Every time I come , everyone that works here is so nice. The ingredients always seem stocked/fresh and the pizza always comes out so fast and taste the best. This is probably one of my favorite places to eat. 

The soda is always so crisp and fresh, I swear their great plastic cups make the drinks taste better.

Oh and my pizza of choice, the build your own, thin crust, white pesto sauce with chicken and spinach, sea salt and oregano! You must try it!!"}
{"text":"The Skinny: a better quality quick fired pizza, reasonably priced (4) service: great for a quick service joint (4) value: around $10 for a quality pizza....bonus points for being good for kids (4).

Dropped by for lunch for a mommy/toddler date as mommy had PTO and the LO had no preschool. 

We ordered the Linked in which is sausage, red pepper, caramelized onions. I added some fresh basil on top. I also ordered a side of quinoa, butternut squash and mixed greens salad.

The pizza dough had a nice texture and crispiness to the crust. We love Grimaldi's too but the crust is a little too chewy for the kiddo to eat. At Blaze, the thinner pizza crust has only a very mild chew which makes it easy for little mouths to eat and little hands to hold.

Just as a side note, I wouldn't overload the pizza with too many ingredients, otherwise the pizza gets soggy.

Flavorwise, the ingredients and sauce profile are pretty tasty. The sauce takes a minimalist approach which I really love.

The salad was quite nice too. I really liked the combination of quinoa and butternut squash. The kiddo grabbed my salad and dug in. She loved it.

Servicewise, the cashier was such a nice guy. He helped me get the high chair to the table and cleaned everything up for us.

Overall, I am really happy to have a good quality fast casual pizza joint in our neighborhood. For the price you can't go wrong (4)."}
{"text":"I have tried their build-your-own pizza on two occasions. It's quite a deal, as you can get an 11-inch pizza with any toppings you want, all for $8.25. For my first pizza I opted for classic red sauce and mozzarella, mushrooms, sauteed onions, and pepperoni for toppings. On my second visit I ordered classic red sauce, goat cheese, mozzarella, parmesan, applewood bacon, mushrooms, red peppers, pepperoni, and roasted garlic as toppings. Both times the pizza came out fast and was very tasty, especially the second time because it was so much more loaded with toppings. Really good pizza, great price, fast service - this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!!! $10 any kind of pizza with any number of topping- how can you not want to go. I always go for the thin crust. The ingredients are fresh and it's literally mouthwatering. The drinks are refreshing and they have free refills."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 pizzas through Postmates with gluten free crust. 
Undercooked, slimy, and tasteless crust. Swimming in grease, even for a chicken and pineapple pizza. Odd taste to the pizza. 

Basically tossed this food in the trash and ordered from Fired Pie. I wouldn't have even given this pizza to someone starving to death. 

Gluten free options for pizza are never expected to be the same as regular crust. But this was beyond reproachable. CPK, My Pie, and Mod Pizza all have better options and that's not saying a lot about those either."}
{"text":"So good! I love the build your own and the options are endless! Never bored! They have a spicy red sauce that's incredible. The crust isn't too thin or too thick and perfectly crispy! Yummmmm! There is one lady that kinda yells at you loudly and rushes you like crazy, not sure if she's a manager or what but the other employees rule. They take their time and really do a good job on the toppings cause nothing's worse then asking for artichokes and getting only a few clumps of it in the corner lol."}
{"text":"I like the Blaze concept. All the toppings are right in front of you, you can see the freshness. They top your pizza, bake it and serve it up piping hot and fresh. 
Their staff is always friendly and the restaurant is always spotless. 
I like their basic cheese and basil pizza best. Their sauce is just the right combo of tangy and not to sweet. The cheese isn't greasy and the basil is always fresh. For $8 you have an awesome lunch with enough pizza to take a slice home."}
{"text":"Would be 5 stars if they had a location in Spring Valley/Summerlin. Excellent Lemonade, flavorful sauce,and vegan options!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this location on Friday night. I've been wanting to try this place for a while now. The line was long but we weren't too concerned. After 15 mins and the line hadn't even moved we decided to go next store to Chipotle. Best decision. They were fast and we got our food and out the door and there still didn't appear to be any movement in the line. I'm sorry but no pizza is worth an hour wait just to order."}
{"text":"This place is a pizza lovers dream. You literally get a made to order pizza like you are choosing a sub at Subway. You can choose thin crust or thick crust (def choose thick crust). Also you can create your own and the best part is, THEY DONT CHARGE FOR EXTRA ANYTHING. Get allllllll the cheese. And drench that baby in toppings and watch them do the work in the brick oven. 

One more thing I like about this place is the staff is SUPER friendly! Keep it up ladies and fellas!"}
{"text":"First time here I tried the build your own with the spicy sauce.. Loved it.. Came back the very next day and started trying the pizzas on the menu.. They have tons of toppings and you can add (or remove) whatever you want to the any pizza on the menu or just go crazy on your own.. They have cane sugar soda, wine and beer too.. Beats the competition by far.."}
{"text":"The Subway of Pizza.  Get a pizza the way you want/like it.  Don't remember what I had, but it was really good."}
{"text":"Amazing stuff right here. If you've ever wanted a pizza with unlimited toppings at a flat price, this is the only place I know of that has it. They don't skimp out on quality either, my favourites being the fresh mozzarella balls, artichokes and Italian sausage. 

The crust is very thin,  so those who like a thick crust may be turned off ( but I'm sure the trade off of as much toppings as you want will make up for it).

After picking your sauce and toppings it goes in the over for about 5 minutes. They seemed to have perfected the thickness of the crust as it comes out firm and crispy and the toppings are all nicely warmed up.

Me and the gf shared a pizza for 10.45 before taxes. Amazing value and honestly one the best pizzas we've  had in a long time. 

Highly recommended if your heading to the movies on yonge/dundas and want a quick bite before it starts."}
{"text":"Sooooo happy they opened a Blaze in my now-neighborhood. Out of all the build your own pizza places this is my fave. Goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes FTW!

Staff is super friendly and not at all stressed when they are busy. Always clean, easy to find parking, what's not to like?

Oh yeah, their double thick crust is much better now! They used to be kinda cardboardy, but now it's fantastic. Bubbly and chewy. Worth the extra $2. Def makes you more full. I used to be able to eat a regular crust whole pizza easily by myself. The double crust is so filling. Of course I can still finish it but you gotta roll me out of there."}
{"text":"The crust is way better than Pieology. Actually I think this is the BEST crust of this style of pizza place I've ever had. They load up the toppings and you still get a crispy crust on your pie, even the very first bite at the point.

The kids that work here really know what they are doing. The first time we went was on Pi day (March 14) and the line was out the door! The staff did great, no one was giving attitude or having a meltdown. They even had someone offering water to people out in the sun. Once you get up to order, no one gives you an eye roll or anything if you want a lot of toppings. And when in the oven, your pie is ready in just a few minutes.

Blaze's pies are a bit larger than Pieology's also. Usually I can finish a Pieology pie in one sitting. At Blaze we each took home 2 slices and they even have a huge pile of to go boxes ready to go. And reheated, crust still awesome!"}
{"text":"When Blaze Pizza opened, I heard about the Yonge & Dundas shoppers & Ryerson students lining up around the block but never wanted to wait in line to try. I wish I did because this place really is the Chipotle of pizza. After one visit I downloaded the app to try to collect a free pizza. I love this concept, it's fresh and delicious and you can gave unlimited toppings of your choice; you really can't dislike this place because you choose the toppings on your pizza! The hype has died down, the lines have died down, but the quality has not. This has become my favourite pizza place in the city and it's always my go-to whenever I haven't had food in that area. Highly recommend! You will not regret."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, friendly over the top service and made to order pizza in just a few minutes. What's not to like? I ordered the Link In, sausage, caramelized onions and red peppers, very thin crust. All that and under 1000 calories. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Super thin pizza made fresh and it is delicious! Kid friendly plus quick and easy."}
{"text":"Fast and easy. All the employees were very nice. We both did build your own pizzas and the came out really tasty."}
{"text":"The owner of Blaze invited me back to try it again so I figured it was time for an updated review. To summarize I tried another custom pie that I wanted to try and it definitely turned out better compared to the first time around.

I'm not sure if I prefer Blaze over the competition but I appreciate that they reached out to me so thank you for that!"}
{"text":"Really good light pizza. Dough was just right and tasted like Naan Bread. Right amount of cheese and fresh vege's. Tried the bbq chkn and green stripe pizza's. It was freshly baked within 5-10mins. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy pizza Togo Right by the neighborhood so why not stop by. When you come you have to get the Build Your Own Pizza. Unlimited topping and unlimited deliciousness"}
{"text":"Ordered online via Yelp.  Super easy to get exactly what you want. They don't fire it until you arrive.  The restaurant is clean and new.  The workers are young and nice.  They are on point, double checking with you what condiments you would like etc.  I was in and out pretty quick.  The crust is thin.  No complaints.  Was overall great.  Only thing is, I don't crave it... Might not be my first choice.  Just preference."}
{"text":"I've heard mixed reviews of this place but I must say, I had quite the enjoyable experience today.

For starters, the service was impeccable. 5/5. From the second we walked in to the moment we stepped out of the store, I felt like a valued customer. It started with one of the female staff who greeted us with a smile from behind the counter as soon as we entered. Then, the male who created our custom pizza for us was patient and nonjudgmental as we clearly fumbled with choosing from the variety of toppings. While we were eating, we had 3 instances of amazing customer service. 1) a girl came by to ask how we were enjoying the food 2) shout out to the employee, JJ, who asked if we would like cups of water and got it for us 3) JJ who, again, came by and volunteered to collect our finished tray of garbage. 

Again, the variety of toppings was amazing - there was lots to choose from and all of the vegetables and meats were fresh! The pizza itself was thin-crusted which was nice and crispy but it also wasn't overly hard. Overall, the pizza was fairly tasty but cooled down relatively fast.. so I would recommend that you eat it in-store for optimal temperature. My only complaint for this place would be the cost, which was a little pricey."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, awesome service, awesome place!!!! Ordered gluten free pizza due to allergy and they were amazing with how careful they were to make sure that everything was safe for my pizza. I totally appreciate that and their attention to detail. Definitely going back!!! Best new find!"}
{"text":"You should definitely come here if you want burnt, cold, topingless pizza! 
I ordered online, said it would be ready in 10 minutes, I don't live far so I left right away. Got there the pizza was ready! 
Then I open the box and my pizza crust was burnt and it was cold. There was about 3 little pieces of chicken on it and some cheese on the side, with a dab of Gorgonzola in the middle. Besides that, it was just burnt bread with a splash of bbq sauce.... to say the least it was terrible! I don't think I could recommend this place  to anyone. What a waste of money! 
Maybe it was just a bad night, but it was so slow, only a few people inside so I couldn't tell you why my pizza was so bad."}
{"text":"We love Blaze! Been eating at the one off Camden and so happy there is one closer now!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  Love the build your own concept. Thin crust nice and crispy every time!"}
{"text":"How was I unaware about this place?! Should have invented it myself. It is a damn chipotle concept with a pizza brand. I love blaze!

Sick in tired of going to PTs and having it built my way for 24 dollars. Came here and got it my way with a soda for less than $10! Blown away. 

Got half green stripe and half build your own. My build your own was sausage, pepperoni, red peppers, garlic and basil. Loved the crispy thin crust. As many toppings as I want and fresh drinks served on tap. 

Customer service was great and they were packed considering it was New Year's Eve. Entire restaurant has about four seats left. There was a line but the line was only about five minutes long. Boom boom boom was all I kept thinking as fast as the pizza was made was as fast as it came out of the oven. Def one of my favorite new places. Especially since I have gestational diabetes, ate three slices and it didn't do one thing to hirer my blood sugar. Win!"}
{"text":"Blaze makes some awesome pizza! I love the concept of a build-your-own pizza. I get it just how I like. It comes out hot and tasty. I've only had the regular crust and it's very nice. However, it's GREAT hot and just ok as it cools down. Warmed up at home isn't great either. I'd say if you don't have a huge appetite, go with a friend and share one. They're a little big for one person, just right for two, with a salad each. I was gonna give them three stars, but they get an extra one for being such GREAT stewards of the environment with their cups and straws made from plants, not petroleum. That's just cool."}
{"text":"First I want to say overall the food quality and concept is great and we have eaten here many times.  My issue is with how the people handle the business.  This evening the computer system was down and this is the 3rd time we have been impacted by this.  There was no communication to the customers and the team members not once apologized for the more than 20 minutes of delay.  The lines were long and you have got to figure how to better manage this issue and have a backup in cases like this.  We are a family of 5 that only got cold pizza and no drinks until the system came back up.  I suggest you show appreciation for your guests and apology when your establishment creates a less than desired circumstance."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. I ordered a plain pie for $5. When I first arrived there was a little bit of a line, but it moved fairly quickly. I walked there, and my pizza was still warm when I got home. Probably a 10min wall, and I stopped to get coffee. Pizza is delicious, especially for only being $5. They also offered to put basil and salt on my pie. The extra mozzarella I asked for was free. Next time I'm going to go with the limitless toppings. Saw other people's pies with some crazy toppings, and they looked delicious. The toppings all looked fresh and stations looked clean. Excited to explore the menu."}
{"text":"Decided to go there based on a friends FB picture of her pizza. It's what I would call \"fast-food\"pizza, but it was good tasting and good quality stuff. 

We were greeted by several \"Hellos\" as we entered. Always great to be acknowledged. You can choose from pre determined topping pizzas OR they have a choose your own (crust, sauces, cheeses, toppings) option. You move down the line as your pizza is created. There are also salads available. Into the oven your pizza goes and about 5 mins later......DONE. 

Good pizza, friendly service, decent prices. We'll go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I'm going to say this, but this is pizza in Canada doesn't suck. Don't get me wrong, it isn't the most amazing pizza that I've ever had... But it is the best pizza I've ever had in Canada. For $11 you can make your own or go with one of the pre designated flavors. The pizzas cook super fast and allow you to customized in any way you like. I really enjoyed the blood orange lemonade, was a nice refreshing change of pace. The s'more cookies were really delicious, I recommend you having them heat them up. If you are looking for something fast, convenient, reasonably priced and you're in the area its not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Blaze is a great fast casual pizza place. Personal pizzas run about $9 and can be shared for two people. It's similar to subway or chipotle where you choose your base and build on top. The staff is friendly and fast. There is free parking in the apartments it is below in their garage. It is also right off the light rail. Would definitely recommend. I also love their fountain drinks, teas, and lemonades. They have a great raspberry drink!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  My wife eats gluten free and has had great GF pizzas at Pieology and other pizza places.  We heard about Blaze being like Pieology and supposedly a good reputation.  But this pizza was the worst we have ever had.  The GF crust was so thin that after it was cooked it was like a crispy flatbread.  Very little cheese and way too salty.  She will never eat here again and that's unfortunate that one pizza could have created this conclusion but it did."}
{"text":"First experience today and it was great. Hands down the best pizza I had in town. Make your own pizza is priced around $8 and it is totally worth it. I think you can put unlimited amount of toppings on it. (I only tried like 8 toppings but it was still good!) but there were some downsides like parts of the dough was uncooked and little pieces of chicken was too. But overall damn good pizza! And yes they have sriracha ;)"}
{"text":"Can't give more than one start for a place that refuses to listen to customers and constantly have bacon in their basil. This is extremely annoying and while the staff is this particular store is very friendly and tried to get me meatless basil (took about 10 minutes), until the Blaze corporation fixes this I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"This place is SO good! The staff is always very friendly and the pizzas are amazing. I've been building my own pizza lately but they do have a menu of pizzas that you can choose from too. Their new desserts are amazing. I love living so close to this place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I actually tried this restaurant on a whim since I was in the area and boy, I was not disappointed in the slightest. 

Blaze Pizza gives you the option to \"BYO - Build Your Own\" pizzas (which I would highly recommend) and its choices of toppings and sauces are incredibly unique and fresh. You can customize everything from gluten-free crust, to base pizza sauces (i.e. pesto, tomato), to various meat and veggie toppings. What I was most impressed by was that unlike other places where you only have a set number of topping options, this place literally had any and every option you could possibly think of. There were 7 types of cheese to choose from, 8 types of meat options, and way too many delicious vegetable toppings to list. The best part? You can have as many toppings as you want!

Naturally, I went ahead and chose as many toppings as I could for my pizza (without it becoming a mountain) and it was delicious. For an 11 inch pizza with unlimited toppings being only $12.75, I'd say it was an amazing deal. The service was also top-notch and the chefs were super friendly and outgoing. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The pizza is so incredibly good - no matter what you put on it . It never comes out nasty. Sweet price for being able to add whatever you want on the pie .Somehow it tasted and made me feel healthy (idk how you do that with pizza , but they did it). Staff is nice , quick and accurate . Even when it's busy you don't have to wait around for anything . The first time I tried it , I brought one pizza home just so everyone could try it . When we finished that pie , we went right back to Blaze and got 2 more . It's a pretty place too . It's definitely something to try. Too good to pass up ."}
{"text":"First time here and it was totally worth it! I was thoroughly impressed by the service we received from the moment we stepped through the door.  I made my own pizza and topped it with ricotta, Italian sausage,  basil and fresh tomatoes. The pizza was done so quickly and I loved how crunchy the thin crust came out.  However the pizza wasn't the only reason I will return.  Finding a place where you feel like you are a priority is so hard to find nowadays and I don't take it for granted.  We will definitely be back for the pizza and the service:)"}
{"text":"Nothing like having pizza fresh and built the way you want. You get to choose from many toppings. The line was nonstop. I'm just glad I got there before the line got too bad. I will be back definitely."}
{"text":"I am sorry, but I still don't know why fast causal pizza crust can't be better.  Actually I do know the answer, it is all about quality ingredients and proper training of the pizza dough stretcher.  However, I don't think that as a company they want to introduce that variable into eat store.  I just can't like the cracker thin dough that has all the air squeezed out of it.  It is more like a sauced saltine than pizza dough. Oh, and don't get me started on the cooking skill of the pizzaiolo, if I dare use that term, at the oven. 

So many locals raves about this place, but in the end it was just another Blaze pizza joint, just like in CA.   

What did I learn today?  Like Frankie says, \"Relax\", Tony says, \"Respect the Craft.\""}
{"text":"Excellent customer service for the speed at rush hour. Even though there are so many customers, they do make you feel welcomed when using your first name. The line was medium but the service was fast. I got the veg out and it was good. The test wasn't over the top amazing but it was delicious. The crust is thin and baked to the perfect crispiness. If I were to come back, I would get the build your own. I appreciate their unlimited choices for toppings and personalized customer experience."}
{"text":"Yelp reviewers hit the nail on the head; Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza was fantastic!

I was close by and read the amazing reviews so I stopped by.  The line was long at 8pm on a Friday but it moved pretty fast.

The service was amazing as I was greeted when it was my turn to order and she took the time to explain how ordering works.  Even though the line was pretty long behind me I was happy to be given a brief but effective explanation as to how I can order my pizza.

The pizza was really good.  It didn't blow me away but I really enjoyed the thin crust and how it is ever so slightly charred.  I was pretty conservative when I ordered so I definitely want to try the different sauces and toppings that they offer.  I'm sure I'll find some great combinations that I'll fall in love with!

I also really liked the restaurant itself.  It was very clean and there are self serve drinks, parmesan cheese and red pepper shakers, and half pizza boxes for left overs!  Keeping all of these things as self serve while maintaining their cleanliness and keeping them organized is a chore in itself I'm sure.

Overall, I'm really glad I tried this place!  It's a bit out of the way for me but I definitely want to go back!"}
{"text":"I've had pizza from every pizza restaurant in the area. This one beats them all hands down!!
The crust is delicious and you can add any amount of toppings you choose. Steve is the general manager and is very nice. The staff is perfect compliment to the product."}
{"text":"In case you haven't heard, Blaze is the Chipotle of pizza! They have a ton of fresh toppings that include a wide assortment of veggies and protein. They even have different base sauces to choose from. If you customize your pizza, you can add whatever toppings you like at no extra charge. Undecisive much? Choose a pizza off of their menu and customize it. I had a half and half pizza. One half was red vine with pepperoni and the other half was BBQ chicken and I added bacon. Trust me, it took me 20 mins to make up my mind, there are soooooo many options. Both were delicious. They have an assortment of drinks and local beers. But you must try the blood orange lemonade. It's sweet, tart and tasty. If you're not in the mood for pizza (seriously? then why are you here) they have an assortment of packaged fresh made salads. The caprese salad with balsamic glaze is yummy. Don't forget dessert. That's right, they have a delicious smore pie that they warm up for you near the fire. It's warm, ooey gooey goodness!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. No one greeted us when we walked in. We had never been here before but luckily we had friends that told us kind of how it works. The only comment was asking my husband what his name was and they butchered it. His name is Michael and they called him Nick. Go figure. We get to the register and everyone was looking around like they've never done anything before. Finally someone rung us up but then we got no receipt. When we sat down to eat it's like everyone had to make up for not speaking to us. We couldn't even eat in peace. Will I come back? After this experience definitely not."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!!! I love the idea of how I can add as many toppings as I want and not pay addition to it. It's also very fast even though there was a long line up. They had a system going on that made it move fast. 

Overall my experience at blaze was superb and I would definitely go back again and again"}
{"text":"Love the fast food Pizza! If you are a fan of spicy you have to try the Spicy sauce... A perfect kick of spicy without being hot! This place is clean, spacious and they call you by name throughout the whole ordering process! I will definitely be back. Pizza took about 10 min to come out and there were 5 people in front of me! Great spot!"}
{"text":"I love Blaze Pizza. As a vegan, it's can be difficult to find places that serve good tasting vegan options but this really hits the spot. It's the best vegan pizza around. When I told them I wanted vegan cheese, a server at this Henderson location was polite enough to offer to change his gloves in order to help prevent cross contamination with dairy and meat. I've been vegan for nearly 4 years and I have never had someone ask me if I wanted them to change their gloves. It was such a sweet gesture. If I didn't visit this place while on vacation, I would come back here again and again. I'm lucky enough to live by a Blaze, but they've never offered to change their gloves like the server at this location did. A+"}
{"text":"I have to admitI was skeptical when I saw how thin the crust was. I am not a thin crust person, I like medium to thick crust. I built my own and sat down at a table. One of the workers went above and beyond delivering our pizza to us and bringing over utensils, napkins, Parmesan cheese, and crushed red pepper. I was impressed with the quality and crispness of the crust. The crust prior to cooking was as thin as a crepe! It rose a lot while cooking and was crispy. Think of this place as the Chipotle of pizzas. You order at the counter, decide your toppings or order their pre designed pizzas and if you want a salad, they have a bunch to choose from. The workers were fast but seemed to not hear what we were saying and that could have been due to the music being a tad loud?  They have limited indoor and outdoor seating. If you're going to dine there, be realistic and go during off peak dining times. Please save fellow yelpers from eye rolls because you needed seating for six people at 6pm and could not believe there was not enough space. Yes, it's limited seating!"}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza is like the Subway of Pizzas. For $12 you can come here and make your own Pizza. You can put any Sauce, meat, veggies, and whatever else your heart desires. I always come here before A Raptors game and Blaze always tastes so good and Raptors always Win when I come here first. 

They have selections of thin crust or thick crust. You can choose from mozza cheese, feta cheese, and whatever other cheeses you want on there. Sauces range from traditional to pesto and meats have every good farm animal meant for pizza. Everything from bacon, ham, sausage....\"yes Lisa some Magical animal!\" (Homer Voice) .... and veggies such as Pineapples, Shrooms, Spinnach, Etc. Etc.

Come to Blaze next time you are hungry near Yonge and Dundas. Make sure you give a donation to all the Doomsday worshippers, breakdancers, and whoever else needs your money."}
{"text":"Great service every single time! The pizza is always just right and I have become a regular here for sure. Great addition to all of the places to eat on Eastern!"}
{"text":"The pizza tastes really good! You can ask for as many toppings as you like. I love to get extra sauce (spicy tomato) and have them brush some pesto sauce in the crust. It comes out very flavorful and filling. Love their pizza."}
{"text":"Another new chain pizza spot!? Naw I'm not gonna like it. That's exactly what I thought before some of the guys said lets go. Ok I was wrong I actually didn't hate it.

Blaze Pizza was fast and efficient. Came here during a busy lunch hour rush and still it only took a few minutes from ordering to eating. It looked like a assembly line with a number of employees behind the counter, everyone knowing their part, and doing it right. Friendly service.

As for the food it's a thin crust pizza, not my preferred crust, made for one person or two depending how much pizza you can eat. Yea yea I know I probably could do more than a few on my own if I really wanted to. They have various signature pizzas you can select from like a Meat Eater, Art Lover, Green Stripe, etc. Or you can customize your pizza with the wide variety of different toppings they have available. It's like Subway start with your base stuff, side step to the left or right, either have them add what's in front of you or not, take another side step, and continue down the line or until they cut you off. Obviously I like to customize the hell out of things when I get the chance especially if you can add as many of the toppings as you want. Just dont get carried away cause it might take longer to cook. I just pointed and that and that and that and that. It came out cooked throughout nothing over or under cooked. You must add SPICY RED SAUCE. I don't really know why but I can taste it in my mouth right now. It's probably nothing special but I just love things with a little spice in it. 

In and out like that. I'd be back."}
{"text":"It was okay. I tasted too much of the burnt dough from the oven though. Nothing special, and not particularly fast. No faster than little Caesars or dominos after the line. Very thin and not filling either. Should be a $5 pizza at best in my opinion but turned our to be $11."}
{"text":"When staying with friends for the week in North LV we opted for ordering a batch of pizzas for dinner - five adults and three children.  Blaze was a recommendation from our friends as a good local pizza shop who had a variety of specialty pizzas as well as gluten free options (our friend's family has dietary restrictions). 

We ordered a variety of pies including the Art Lover and Red Vine. I enjoyed the size of the pizzas since they were small enough for each adult to have their own. I also liked that their dough was perfectly cooked and their sauce wasn't overwhelming - two things I always judge aside from the toppings and service. 

Overall, Blaze was good - but only just good. We're spoiled with Pizza Man Dan's back in Ventura so this place didn't quite satisfy that pizza craving we were hoping for. The toppings were simple on both pizzas and nothing special to note about either.

I don't doubt that dining-in customers have different experiences, but for pick-up, and the pizzas we ordered, they were just okay. 

Perhaps we'll have to try them again the next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I've been to this newly-opened restaurant about a hundred times so far - it is THAT good!  There is something about freshly prepared food that satisfies your taste buds.  Each pizza is certainly enough for a hungry individual and reheated (or cold) leftovers are also delicious (although I see to finish all of MY pizzas).  This place is great because my family of four can order what they want and how they want it and we never have to compromise on the toppings.  My favorite is the spicy-red pizza sauce with fresh ovalini cheese, topped with meats and veggies.  My wife likes the pesto-based sauce with chicken and veggies, while both of my kids like to experiment with toppings each time we come.  At $7-8 a pizza, it's definitely an affordable option to satisfy a family of four!  It takes only 2-3 minutes for each pizza to cook, so waiting is not an issue.  I've also tried the online ordering - they don't cook the pizzas until you arrive, so no issues with cold food.  The online option doesn't give you a few options that you can get ordering live, so that's what I prefer.  It's hard to justify Dominos or Pizza Hut when this place can satisfy everyone for less!"}
{"text":"Just left blaze pizza and I had the worst experience ever. This was my  time here and I was real excited until all the workers gave me attitude because I wanted high rise crust, if you give me attitude I'll give it right back. Don't treat your customers like crap because you don't like your job idiot. and my food is good, too bad I won't be coming back. The Hispanic short girl gave me attitude the whole time, she needs to be fired. And my boyfriend heard the worker say she would never put white sauce on a pizza, why would you not sell your sauces? Why would you say that in front of a customer? Get your customer service up instead of being so negative at your job"}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place after many recommendations. I now understand why the restaurant has such high reviews.  

Famous for their thin-crust, fresh toppings and fast orders, Blaze Pizza is a perfect casual option any time of the day.  The restaurant seems to be always packed with people, so order online if you can.  

As a first-timer, I went with a simple mozzarella, Italian sausage and arugula pizza - but I would love to try their unlimited topping option next time."}
{"text":"Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza on Eastern has me fired up! I really am psyched about Blaze's fresh and fast concept for my all-time favorite fast food. Their ingredients are ample with a wide range of meats like pepperoni, Italian sausage, chicken; they have fresh veggies, I love the spinach and basil; the cheese! Yummm and they don't stop there, they have just about everything you could want on a pizza. Don't forget their perfectly balanced red sauce, it's one of several. 

It's amazing to me they can offer unlimited toppings all for one low, low price. To top it off, they offer a really tasty gluten-free crust that not only tastes good, it holds up all the toppings I put on it. I love pizza but I got tired of ordering and waiting and waiting for it to get done. Not at Blaze! It's ready in just a few minutes. You can't beat them for taste, price and time. Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"The pizza is so fresh and delicious!

The crust makes everything come together perfectly! They let you put whatever you want on it. Our favorite is the red vine with extra meats!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Blaze since it's been open, and I've never had a bad experience! The pizza's quick, delicious, and portion-wise it's perfect for two, or for one if youre starved. Staffing wise, theyre all really great - Jude in particular has been taking and firing up my order since f o r e v e r and always giving amazing service. Thanks for the pie! :)"}
{"text":"I didn't even try the food because I was so put off by the 'you have to order online if you have a coupon or else come into the store.' First of all, I was prepared to order online, had everything decided on, only to find out you have to pay by credit card to actually order online. I don't have a credit card (not everyone does, just saying). Also, I feel as if they should have made this clear before I went through the whole ordering online process. This is irritated me but I decided I would call for pick-up instead, as I had no intention to eat there. I called and they said I had to come in to order. The woman that picked up was not helpful, at all when I called in for pick-up, simply refusing my request without being polite, helpful or apologetic. Not everyone likes to eat at the establishment or has a credit card. Because of the companies' inability to recognize this, I am no longer interested in trying out Blaze Pizza."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here and the Gluten-free crust is amazing!! Always get excellent service and the tunes are great too. This is my go to pizza place from now on."}
{"text":"I am sitting in the parking lot of Blaze pizza infuriated! The guy who made my pizza literally had an attitude the entire time. He kept making smart remarks! The lady prior to me literally loaded her pizza with toppings. There were also other ppl there. The guy who made my pizza kept complain about the timer. I asked for a 2 topping pizza, but after seeing the lady next to me and then the guy asking me if I wanted anything else's while moving along the line of toppings... I decided to get sausage bacon, mozzarella, red sauce, olives and mushrooms... the guy said \" you're killing me\" and rolled his eyes when I asked for the mushrooms... 





This is my 1st and LAST time ever coming here"}
{"text":"Iced tea, blood orange lemonade and a bit of the mint lime agua fresca. I nearly cried when my coworker threw it away. Trusted the awesome girl who made my pizza and ended up with pesto, chicken, whole garlic, zucchini, ricotta, basil and balsamic reduction on top. Who knew that the best quick pizza for the same price (or less) than soggy junk around Tempe could be incredible at under ten bucks?  Seriously try the mix I mentioned at the top. Can't wait to try the delicious looking salads. The staff was great and the guy managing the oven was so informative about the brand, their future plans, what makes the place unique and really sold me on it. Not big on brand loyalty outside of clothing but this gentleman made me want to look for Blaze in each city I live in. Excited to move to Southern California knowing I can find work break friendly pizza in the area. Seriously, if you have thirty minutes, you've got a delicious lunch. Love this business model plus the decor and music clearly had some great money and design behind it."}
{"text":"Today was my first day at Blaze Pizza an it was an amazing experience. The staff is all joyful and knowledgeable. They made my experience an exceptional time that I will never forget. Their cashier ¿Massiah?, (Sorry if the spelling is incorrect) he made my day. He was so funny and full of smiles. I will definitely be returning and telling all my friends and family to come here. Thank you guys for bringing a fun family atmosphere here. This is the best pizza joint in the Valley thus far."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Food is awesome.  Quick service.  Employees are very nice.  Clean."}
{"text":"I love that you can literally get every single topping for $7.95. They even have goat cheese! Fresh vegetables and even vegan options! It's literally cooked so quick and it's so so delicious! The blood orange lemonade on point. I don't know why I have never come here before! I love pizza!"}
{"text":"Still on the hunt for decent Pizza North of Uptown, did not find it at the new Blaze Pizza in Concord.  Pizza was bland, mostly due to a lackluster sauce (which BTW was applied LIBERALLY resulting in a soggy mess).  The \"grilled\" chicken was sparse and underwhelming and the pesto drizzle was on the oily side.  My son's pizza, a Hawaiian style was descent and the meat was plentiful. 

Since this is a new restaurant I knew it would be busy on Saturday so we downloaded the APP and placed our order online, they even sent me a code for BOGO pizza which I attempted to apply only to find out that the APP was having issues with promo codes so I had to pay full price. I stopped by Earth Fare to grab some brews and headed over to Blaze for my Pie (assuming that it would be ready by then, not) and found that my pie was just being assembled.  I sat back and watched the chaos that ensued as diner after diner found issues with their order accuracy and wait times, at this point the BOGO pizza at Earth Fare was sounding better each minute. My name was called and with much trepidation I approached the counter to inspect my full price purchase, the expediter reached to inspect my pie first and accidentally pushed it over the counter at which point with ninja like reflexes I grabbed for the pie saving it from premature doom (not sure if Blaze offers Pizza insurance like Domino's).   

Had the pizza been good I would not balk at paying $17 for 2 small pizzas, I don't see myself going back to Blaze anytime soon which is too bad considering its only 3 minutes down the road.

{"text":"My daughter and I love Blaze pizza. We try others similar pizzeria but we always come back to Blaze. Something about their sauce that makes it more flavorful."}
{"text":"My son could hardly wait to try this place and create his own pizza.  It was really crowded which gave us plenty of time to marinate over the toppings/sauce/crust.  He decided on a basic sausage, bacon pizza.  I had the pesto mixed with red sauce base with bacon, mushrooms, sausage and a pesto drizzle on top.  We both loved the thin crust and the pizza was flavorful and was pretty good overall.  I think this location is pretty new so it tends to be busy no matter the time, but the line moves along quickly.  The pizza is reasonably priced and they offer a few different types of salad as well and the drinks seemed to be really popular."}
{"text":"Pizza was bomb (had the meat lovers one) and the warm s'more afterwards was even more bomb."}
{"text":"I came today to use a BOGO coupon, as well as a free drink coupon, using the app. The app does not work at all, but that is another review for another time. The fine print of the coupons say nothing about using multiple coupons on one order. When I tried to use both coupons on one order, the cashier was ready to apply both coupons because, as she said, she has done so in the past and knows that the fine print said nothing against it. The manager, with the gray beard, overheard and told her not to allow it. After telling him the coupons say nothing against it, he agreed and said he knew, but was going to deny it anyways, all with a smirk. I could tell the other employees were also tired of him and honestly, I feel bad for whoever works underneath him. After this interaction, I don't think this is a fair business that I want to continue spending my money at. The pizza was slightly below average and definitely not worth $10 for the small portion, nor the attitude I got from the manager, who is supposed to set the example for his employees. Overall, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at Blaze Pizza ever, but I'm not a big fan of creating my own pizza like a Subway. I like the normal cheese pizza, and oddly enough they had that on the menu.

The pizza was made in probably like 1 minute and 30 seconds from start to finish. The pizza tasted great and I would eat at Blaze Pizza if I ever need a quick lunch, but the whole 'normal' pizza is still a little bit better because it has more cheese once you bite down."}
{"text":"Love it. Went back again. Great friendly staff. New favorite pizza spot! Like what?!?!?!! Unlimited toppings for one price. Come on now!"}
{"text":"This place has been added to my list of go-to pizza destinations in the city.

I had just gotten off the plane coming home for a visit when my siblings took me here.
Walking in I already knew what I was expecting. An awesome pizza.
The place had a busy but yet fun type of atmosphere. Not the chaotic unorganized type.

I love the fact that you can create your own pizza with thin or original crust and have unlimited toppings to your hearts desire! They had a wide variety of toppings that you can add, some of which I didn't even think you can add onto pizza. 

I played it a little safe by getting a thin crust with Alfredo sauce, two different cheeses, spinach, chicken, bacon, and a drizzle of BBQ sauce to finish it off.
It was the bomb dot com!

The pizza came out perfectly! I had asked them to over cook it a little because I like my thin crusts with extra crisp and they were happy to do it. I definitely enjoyed my creation!

The service was great. Welcoming and friendly staff. I'm for sure stopping by again the next time I'm in the city."}
{"text":"I can see myself eating here at least once a week! I'm allergic to wheat products and anything with cow's milk or eggs so knowing a pizza exists that won't make me sick is a great find.

I got a Build Your Own for $8.25 and was able to get a gluten-free pizza crust topped with vegan cheese. They offer unlimited toppings like meatballs and sauteed onions as well as traditional fare like pepperoni and pineapples. I was unsure about what I was getting into so I opted for pepperoni and red onions ... it was perfect!

What stuck out the most was the customer service. The kid taking my order asked if I had allergies (due to the gluten-free crust request) and notated it. They offered me untainted sauce (sauce that had not come into contact with any normal pizza crusts) and used a new, sterilized pizza cutter to prevent cross-contamination. On top of that, they asked if I was a first-timer (I guess it was obvious) and made me feel very welcome.

Also the dough knots looked really, superbly delicious! I would have tried them but ... wheat."}
{"text":"Delicious build your own pizza! Great value for 7.95 and all you could want for toppings. They also offer a gluten-free crust which always makes me excited. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza but the staff at this location plays around too much. Don't call me up and say my pizzas ready then play around with your co workers it's rude and not inviting to guests. I work in customer service so I know how it goes you wanna have fun too but sometimes theirs a time and place for all that. I said I was going to come back in my last review but maybe not so much anymore."}
{"text":"The toppings are unlimited if you choose to build. Thin crust, was not filling, but you can have everything on your pizza. One of the best Pizzas I tried in Toronto for sure. Friendly staff and reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is the Chipotle of pizza. Awesome ingredients. Awesome result. I've been once and have to go back. The spicy red sauce is awesome. Did I use awesome already? Well it is. 

The place was super busy but the flow is perfect as everyone was able to find a table. The staff are great, very personable. 

I'll be back. Sooner than later."}
{"text":"Our new favorite pizza join. My kids love the plain cheese and the service is always so great! Super reasonable prices for pizza. I recommend getting the white alfredo sauce! The only ingredient i didn't like was their chicken. Had a funky taste to it."}
{"text":"The slowest service. We went for a late lunch. Only a few people ahead of us and it still took 20 min just to pick out our toppings and pay. There were at least 4 employees cleaning while just 1 made pizzas. The time we spent here we could've just gone to an restaurant in the mall and had our food. What the heck?"}
{"text":"I got a free pizza coupon in the mail so I decided to check this place out. Upon placing my order, they mentioned that their crust is VEGAN, which I think is a step in the right direction! You basically go in, and can order a pizza from the menu or can go down the line and choose your sauce and toppings right in front of you. The pizza was alright, not the best, not the worst, and the crust gets a little floppy when it cools down. Overall, cool spot. They've got a salad bar with three different salad choices too!"}
{"text":"When I first walked into Blaze it was love at first sight! Create your own personal pizza with unlimited toppings for under 10 dollars!!! They have a large selection of meats, cheeses, and veggies to create your one of a kind pizza masterpiece. My favorites are the Italian meatballs, fresh ricotta, roasted garlic cloves, and their roasted red peppers. To help wash down your masterpiece try their strawberry and mango agua frescas. Blaze is an overall great place for a casual dinner or weekend pizza run. The staff are always welcoming and have your pizza to you quickly even when the place is extremely busy."}
{"text":"Love the food here and am so happy to see more of these popping up around the West Coast.  Fantastic tasting create your own pizzas served by friendly employees at affordable prices.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"wow I can't get enough of this place!

It's so customizable and always ends up delicious! Build your own pizza has unlimited toppings (and many toppings options)!

Their garlic pesto base is really yummy and I enjoy ovalini mozzarella over shredded mozza! Opt for half red sauce and half pesto base if you love different flavours. The pizza comes out fast (3minutes!), fresh and with a super crispy thin crust!

The pizza comes in a standard size that will definitely fill you up. When you dine-in, there are shakers on the side with chili flakes, parmesan, italian blend, even sriracha sauce! If you buy a drink, there is unlimited refills. Try their lemonades- it's good but some might taste more watery than others. 

It's located downtown core (close to Eatons, beside Dundas square), expect many people during peak hours. $15 including tax and drink is not a bad deal. Food comes fast, place is clean, super friendly service and food is yummy!! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Blaze four times. Three out of our four trips to this restaurant were terrible experiences. I will not go back.

The first time my fiance and I ate at Blaze, it was wonderful. We went on opening day, got free pizza, and it was delicious. The service was great. The food was great. We thought we found a new go-to eating spot. My one complaint was that I purchased a smore and asked it to be warmed up. They forgot to warm the smore up, and I had to go up and ask for it after ten minutes. It was terrible at room temperature. I decided I wouldn't order that again.

We went back to Blaze for a second time about a week later. We waited an excessive amount of time to receive our pizza, and when we did, our pizza was burnt. They took my fiance's pizza back and made him a new one for free. They tried to tell me my BURNT pizza was normal. I told them it was unacceptable. So they made me a new one as well. My new pizza didn't come out until after my fiance was done eating his new pizza. However, my fiance's new pizza was STILL BURNT. The manager, Jared, brought out his new pizza, looked at the bottom, acknowledged that it was still burnt, and served it to my fiance anyway. My fiance felt obligated to eat the pizza because Jared gave us free pizza cards to come back at a later date, and my fiance felt it just wasn't worth the trouble to get a third pizza in the hopes that this pizza would not be burnt. We were not the only ones receiving burnt pizzas. Several other people had pizzas that need to be remade because they were burnt, and Jared was handing out free pizza cards to other people.

On our third trip to Blaze, we used the free pizza cards given to us because we had burnt pizzas. My fiance's pizza was again burnt. We kept the pizza because they were free.

We decided to give Blaze one more chance and we went back for our forth and final time. Everyone in the line to pick your toppings was cheerful and friendly. The lady at the register was very kind and happy. We sat down and waited for our pizzas. My fiance's name was called. He brought his pizza over and went back up to wait for mine. To be clear, we ordered our pizzas together at the exact same time. Our pizzas went in at the same time. They came out at the same time. Over five minutes pass and my name has still not been called. My pizza was sitting under the heat lamp while it was passed over for other people who ordered after me to receive there pizzas. So my fiance's pizza was sitting on our table getting cold while my pizza was sitting under a heat lamp waiting to be cut and served to me for over five minutes. I had to explicitly ask why my pizza was just sitting there and ask to be served my pizza. If I hadn't, it would have sat there for who knows how long. They did not offer to make us fresh pizzas. They didn't say anything at all. Just handed me my pizza like it wasn't a big deal that my fiance's pizza was now cold and mine had been under a heat lamp. To top it all off, my fiance's pizza was burnt FOR THE THRID TIME. Three out of our four times at Blaze, he was knowingly given a burnt pizza. Unacceptable.

We ate our pizza and I asked to speak with the manager, Jared. I told Jared everything I wrote above from our first time at Blaze to our last time at Blaze. Jared's exact words were \"okay.\" I replied with \"okay?\" And he said \"I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry that happened. But you two are the only ones who have ever had a problem here.\" He tried to make it seem as though we should be okay with poor service and burnt pizza. And it he lied when saying we were the only ones who had a problem because many people had a problem with their burnt pizzas on our second trip to Blaze. Further, he said \"well, that's just one piece that was burnt\" because we saved one piece of my fiance's burnt pizza to show Jared that the pizza was burnt, again. The whole pizza was burnt, but he tried to make it out like only one slice was burnt. Regardless of if just one slice or the whole pizza was burnt, a customer should never be served any burnt pizza. Ever. 

Jared was completely unprofessional, rude, and dismissive of our complaints. Needless to say, we will never go back to Blaze. We are much happier going to their competitors and giving them our money instead."}
{"text":"I think it was Shakespeare who said, \"Pizza, pizza forever, there's no such thing as too much good pizza.\" A brilliant man, that Billy was.

I'm a devout VPN follower, but Blaze is going to be my go-to alternative in the downtown core, especially in the non-food-court/crappy chain deadzone of Yonge & Dundas. This is a chain that I'd welcome an outpost of in my own living room. The quality of the pizza is excellent, you can try something new every time, there are 7 types of cheese, it's a foolproof solution for group dining (vegan, dairy- or gluten-free, and picky eaters included) and there are SEVEN TYPES OF CHEESE. My loaded vegetarian pie left nothing to be desired.

They also provide fantastically convenient and eco-friendly half-size boxes for your leftovers, which I may have discovered fit perfectly into my laptop bag. A definite plus if you are a working woman like myself who wants to outwardly tell the world, \"I'm a put-together business professional and I'm leaning in\", but actually have a briefcase full of pizza."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service. Friendly environment & clean bathrooms. I'm not used to this type of pizza. I tend to prefer Sammy Wood Fired pizza instead. Maybe a little bit more cheese and a little bit more crispy on the crust wood be better. I will be going back to give them a chance to earn that 5th star. Thanks for making me & my family feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how deliciously friendly and amiable, and helpful with many pieces of advice and tips on how to make a delicious pizza at this chain restaurant were you can construct your own pizza. Unfortunately the pizza was a pile poop.

End of review."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming our go to place for pizza. It's simple, fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review: 

I got the white top pizza on a gluten-free crust, which is an extra $4. Most places charge an extra couple of dollars so this is on the pricey side, but the crust is delicious and worth the splurge. You can build your own pizza or get a preset one like I did. 

Everything is made in front of you ,except the crust, which is pre-made, and they put it on a black pan instead of the wood fibreboard the other crusts are put on. I'm not sure if this is to reduce cross contamination or because of the way the gluten-free crust has to be cooked. 

When you order and request a gluten-free crust, they ask you if the request for no gluten is an allergy or a dietary choice. I was the first one there so they had put on new gloves and new toppings, but if you order after people have been served there might be cross contamination. They use a ladel to scoop sauce onto the pizza and then use the same ladel to spread it on the crust and then put the ladel back into the pot of sauce, so if you have Celiac's disease you may need to request that they apply sauce from a new container. 

Overall the pizza was delicious and I didn't have any reactions to it. Note that I have a gluten intolerance and can manage with minor cross contamination.  

TL;DR possibility of cross contamination"}
{"text":"Blaze have opened my eyes to a lot of things. Where have they been all my life. Mind you, I'm not a pizza person. But if I have pizza. It will be a hand tosses/ thick crusted pan pizza, typical pepperoni one slice type! 
But recently I have to some lifestyle changes. More aware of my eating habits. Working out a lot and realizing it best to venture out when it comes to food, plus I can't eat the heavy carb, thick crust like I used too. 
Blaze offered fresh ingredients and they \"WILL DO AS YOU SAY!\" I literally say it out loud to my pizza guy! How often you get to say, \" hey you do as I say when it's comes to how I like my pizza!\" Real loud! 
I ordered the thin crust grilled chicken, simple classic red sauces, little cheese, grilled zucchini, spinach and pineapple! Then they cooked it a fire oven. Oh my goodness. Please see my video! 
The crust are thin yet not soggy! Everything tasted soo light! I ate the whole thing. And don't forget to try the amores cookies. I could die for them. Soooo yummy. 
Also I like how Blaze try their best to keep things local. Involve in the community and used recycle products. It's nice to know companies like this stand for something. Their mission are strong. I will be back and I don't think I will ever go back to thick crust pizzas again!"}
{"text":"All my good friends have heard me rave about Blaze, I'm pretty much there at least once a week, stacking my \"build-your-own\" with unlimited toppings for just over $13 taxes in. Pizzas can be ordered ahead online or built in a fast queue in store and once paid at cash, fast fired in 180 seconds flat. 

Perfect thin crust and delicious flavouring (my favourite BYO includes the spicy red sauce, Gorgonzola/ovalini blend, jalapeño peppers, bacon/sausage/chicken, tons of veggies and pesto drizzle). Worth repeat visits!!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with this pizza chain.  I absolutely loved the idea of getting to eat a pizza that I completely designed and customized by myself.  Not only that, but it was all for just one set price!  So awesome!

After taking numerous photos of my pizza from various angles, it was time to dig in.  Mmm, I really indulged and enjoyed my pizza.  It was savory and had all the toppings I loved to eat."}
{"text":"UPDATED: 
I came back on Wednesday, August 16 at 7:15 pm and was again very disappointed with the service! All the employees were bulsh*tting with each other while I was waiting on them and had a line of people behind me. So unprofessional and really hurt my experience here. The employees should all be spoken with because this is my SECOND bad experience here, I keep coming back because I love the food so much but really it is getting unbelievable. There were also women behind the counter without hairnets and some had long hair!! Sincerely hope that does not end up in anyones food!!!!i

ORIGINAL:
I like that this place has vegan options BUT the employees are hella rude. There was a woman who was NOT wear ing a name tag (not sure if thats allowed) who fucked up my pizza and was super rude about it. The only good employee y'all had was bob :))) he was an angel and deserves a raise. I know y'all don't pay him enough to be dealing with his rude ass coworkers. 

Overall though good quality pizza. I like the vegan cheese & that you give unlimited topping :) Will maybe be returning"}
{"text":"I feel bad already . . . so many 4 & 5 stars for what some might consider novelty pizza.  Years ago my office in Upstate New York was above an Italian restaurant and pizza shop.  I guess I became somewhat of a pizza snob munching, watching, and smelling traditional, hand-tossed, made from scratch, authentic pizza (yes I know Chicago has their thing, too).  Blaze IMO is the \"welcome to Moe's\" shtick on pizza making.  Far from NY or Chicago.

I, too, ordered the Green Stripe, but alas they were outta pesto and delivered it sans arugula.  While the pizza is tasty, I doubt I'll return.  Maybe if they were just around the corner.  Just not a fan."}
{"text":"This was a much better experience than my first time here, during which my pizza was burned.  The crust is both crispy and chewy, yum.  The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  The menu is fairly simple and reasonably priced for what you get.  Orders are out very fast for a pizza place.  I had the red vine, which could have used a little more cheese but I could have asked for that for no extra charge.  My husband had the Link In with pepperoni, he said it was \"meaty\". They do not charge you for each topping like most pizza places which is nice.  It's basically like the subway of pizza but much better than subway."}
{"text":"I have to be honest that I was not a fan at all the first time I came here.  Perhaps it was the choice of preselected pizza that I had chosen.  We came back here a second time and I opted for the build your own pizza and basically selected 60% of their toppings for my pizza. The taste was amazing!  I knew that I messed up the first time around :)

This is my go-to pizza place whenever pizza is on the menu!  It does get quite busy around the lunch hour so highly recommend going a little before noon.  We tried ordering online and picking up when we get there but found that the online ordering system can be improved on.  They don't actually have your pizza ready when you get there despite the option and ability to specifying your pickup time.  They put your oven once you arrive on location and inform the cashier that you're there.  We ended up actually waiting twice as long as regular patrons that just stood in line and ordered.  Nonetheless, highly recommend for people to customize and build your own pizza!"}
{"text":"I Enjoy this business model! Make your own pizza.  the service is quick..  food is great. nice place to go with friends!"}
{"text":"Great pizza the staff was over the top nice and so helpful.  I got the link in and added goat cheese calamari olives and caramelized onions.  Thin crust cooked to perfection I can't wait to take my kids.  Great"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Got the white top and veg out mmmmhhh. Defiantly order online to save time. Ordered online wait was ten minutes got in there went straight to counter since food was already paid ahead picked it up and enjoyed. Can't wait till the Sahara and hualapi location opens will b closer to my house. Will be my new pizza spot"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and the establishment is kept clean, the pizzas are 10 inches made with a thin crust so you get more flavor from the toppings. The BBQ Chicken pizza was great with me adding my own twist to their menu style version including jalapenos, roasted garlic, and black olives. The blood orange lemonade complimented the pizza the right way for enjoyable dinner before going to the movies."}
{"text":"Very impressed. 

I only work in the Dundas area now and then and this time I decided to try Blaze at a co workers recommendation. 

I got a build your own with turkey meatball, applewood bacon, grilled chicken, tomatoes, roasted garlic and pineapple. It was fun picking toppings and they had a ton to choose from. 

The pizza was cooked nice and crispy and only took a few minutes. I was a little worried as I only had a short time for lunch and thought waiting for a pizza would be longer. The crew was quick and friendly though even when there was a line starting to form for what looked like a lunch rush. 

I'll be back again to try a different set of toppings when I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the hype. Staff are extremly friendly and the quality of pizza is better than your usual pizza pizza/domino.

The unique thing about this pizza place is that you have an option of putting unlimited toppings on your pizza if you wish... and when I mean unlimited, I mean you can go on days asking for pepporini! The pizza is quick to serve and there are many ingredients you can choose from (besides just the standard). Bonus: if you like thin crust pizza then this is the place to be. Super crispy when it's fresh.

I went on opening day and got their free pizza day but even with the prices listed, it is quite fair for the ingredients you get to select on your pizza. (Don't you hate it when chicken breast is charged as double the ingredient?!) No worries here!

Will definitely be my local go to pizzaeria as it is super central in the downtown core as well!"}
{"text":"The GM of this location is what makes this place as great as it is. I've been here a few times and he is always helping new employees, checking on guests, cleaning up and filling in wherever needed. It's this type of leadership that makes a place successful, and many other restaurants could learn something from it."}
{"text":"Let me say WOW. This place totally blew my expectations out the water!! First of all the customer service is amazing. They call you by your name and make sure they can do everything they can to satisfy the customer. And they smile!! Next the food was amazing! As well as extremely affordable for what you receive. They have pizzas that you can personalize with as many toppings as you please all for the same price. I recommend the spicy tomato sauce and make sure to get extra cheese. And it's all 8 bucks!! I went back today and the employees remembered my name. This place is awesome. Brought a few coworkers with me too. This is definitely a new hot spot for everyone at work. I highly recommend it to everyone. There is nothing I could say bad about this place!!"}
{"text":"So I just tried this place for the first time today and then ingredients are really great taste good. The staff was great super friendly. I would've been fine with my pizza but when i ordered a meat eater's signature pizza off the menu they just gave me onion and pepperoni I was extremely disappointed. I am pregnant so when I get hungry it's serious and I was seriously disappointed with a mouth full of onions."}
{"text":"I ate here with my 3 girls and everyone loved their pizza. The flavors and prices are great. I ordered a caprese salad with my pizza and it just big enough to accompany a pizza.  We'll definitely return. The inside is a bit tight - that's the only downside because the place was packed when we went."}
{"text":"I'm a California native, so I was a bit surprised to see a Blaze pizza pop up randomly in Tempe. I consider myself a \"self proclaimed pizza snob\". Detail and the freshness of the ingredients is everything. 

With that being said, this is probably by far the best experience I've had at any pizza joint and it could not had been done without the general manager Nicole, and her staff. Nicole, if you ever read these reviews, remember this face, because you will be seeing it more often!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the fast-fired pizza concept and Blaze has just become my new favorite spot. First, it's just down the road from my house. Second, Blaze is the new \"best-in-class\" for this restaurant concept. The crust is really what makes Blaze better than Pieology.  It's just better - thicker, has a real crust, good taste.  The toppings are fresh and it's add all you want type of deal. I love the BBQ pizza with pineapple and red peppers added.  The white sauce pizza is awesome too. If you like pizza (don't we all?) then you'll absolutely love Blaze."}
{"text":"Tried Blaze today around noon. Loved it! Lots of stuff to choose from. Fresh and \"Fire'd\" up in no time! Employees were cool. Guy who cut pizza was friendly and polite as well! Loving the Blood Orange Lemonade too!! Definitely a nice change to typical beverages. I'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Long gone is the reign of Subways for DIY meals. It's pizza's turn now! 

The gimmick at Blaze is the option to customize your personal pizza with as many of their toppings as possible for a flat fee. Yes, that's right, you get unlimited toppings. It's a pretty sweet deal considering the fact that toppings usually cost over a dollar each at your standard pizza vendor. The variety is vast and diverse as well. You get the full gamut!  I mean when you can toss a salad onto your pizza, you know you're on a special gastric journey!

Also, there is nothing negative to note about the service. The service is efficient, even among the traffic of hands reaching for various ingredients.  Plus, the workers are engaging and down to earth, so they give you a good break from the commonly jaded reactions you get at older pizza parlours.  They honestly make it seem fun to work there!

Pro tip: Your personal pizza will be cut into about 6 slices, so you can definitely share it with someone else for a lighter meal. You can also customize it in halves, so your partner can personalize their own side. In-fighting is not required!

I highly recommend Blaze for everyone who isn't on a carb-free diet. Gluten-free eaters, you can rest easy here too.  Whether you're a picky eater or someone who loves making strange food combinations, you're going to enjoy adding your personal touch to a pizza here."}
{"text":"Blaze pizza for the first time & it was awesome! Great value for the price & the area. The staff is also very friendly & helpful. Just went with a 1 topping pepperoni for my 1st time, but getting the build your own next time. A chipotle style ordering system that I like. Got feta & mozzarella for my cheeses & added the sea salt (highly recommend) & oregano. Highly recommended this place & will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I love how clean this place is. The people that work here are extremely friendly and nice. Those two factors is the main reason why I'll always be a fan of this place.
Now on the the pizza --- I love the concept of build your own pizza. One of my best friends suggested the White Top pizza so that's what we ordered. Wow...such a great choice. The Applewood bacon was amazing...along with the other toppings of Mozzarella, Chopped garlic, Oregano, and Arugula in a tasty White cream sauce,

I will definitely return and build my own pizza next time. Give this place a try! Cheers***"}
{"text":"This was a great place, we got to make our own pizza and it was delicious. My son loved the fact he could choose his own toppings."}
{"text":"Awesome service. First time coming to Blaze and Manager came out and was taking our trash. I always appreciate great service. Five stars! Thank you!!! Food was delicious as well!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for good ol pi day. It was the perfect time to try this place out because everyone raves about it and the pizzas were only $3.14. I ordered the green stripe pizza but no chicken and added white sauce as the base. Once again a made to order place so I walked in happy and the pizza was good minus the sea salt. I think next time I'll order the high rise dough cause the regular dough was not enough but def worth the trip and veryyyyy good pizza!"}
{"text":"Blaze is a good name since this place is on fire.  I decide for my first visit to try something predesign signature the bbq chicken, as much meat eater was calling my name I'm a sucker for bbq on pizza it's awesome


The pizza was good, it was a thin crust which i dont usually eat thin crust but this pizza was so good and the pizza is spot on 10 dollars for a personal that is pretty filling. I was in around 3 on Wednesday and not too many people. Thou I probably missed the lunch rush from the last review (Collin S.) He noted it being packed with \"cool people\" probably college students since Ryerson is right there and it not too far from Eaton centre and right across from Dundas square.

I be back to create my own"}
{"text":"This place has become, by far, our favorite neighborhood pizza place! We end up here about one night a week having our favorite pizzas! It's super family friendly and comfortable! We love bringing our little one and even joining with friends and sharing a date! It's a great environment with tremendous customer service! We absolutely love it and will continue to return, often! :)"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, unlimited fresh toppings, and a delicious thin crust pizza served to you within 7 minutes. All for $11. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Blaze pizza. When my wife and I first walked in we were looking at the menu, and one of the workers called us up to the counter and helped us by explaining how their menu worked and gave us suggestions. He was incredibly friendly and pleasant. I built my own pizza, which is $7.85 and you can get whatever toppings you want at no extra charge. After you build your pizza, you pay while they cook it, which is not a long process at all. My pizza was very good in my opinion, but I made a mistake by ordering the spicy sauce on my pizza. I enjoy heat, and it was tasty, but after two slices it was painful to eat. Other than that, my experience was very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Wow tasty huge personal pizza and put whatever you want in it for the same price. So full of flavor and the speediness of the service is above most dine-ins. The servers were always making sure that all our needs are met. Definitely a place to come next time we visit Henderson."}
{"text":"You can not go wrong here. You pay one price. $7.65 per pizza. You can put on as many quality toppings on as you like. There are other places in town like this, but the great service you get here from Jared the general manager and all his staff really puts it over the top. This service and the great pizza justifies a easy 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Wow thats the best way to describe this eatery. Welcomed the minute you walk in, thanked multiple times for choosing to eat there,to the selection of over 30 different toppings to the immaculate condition of the restaurant,and last but not least the price. other places should be ashamed that they rip of people when this business is very fair in their prices.I will return to this location many times in the future.."}
{"text":"This will be my last visit to this place.  There seems to be a lag in enthusiasm with the staff.  My wife noticed this too.  When it first opened we were hooked with the food (which is still good) and the energetic staff.  Overtime this energy has dissipated substantially.  Also, my military discount was not honored.  I wish this was a one time issue but it's apparent things are in the downward slope for this venue.  So sad."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizzas!!! So Delicious! You can add all the toppings you want for one price. Ask for the drizzle sauce once your pizza is done! My favorite is pesto drizzle! It's So good!"}
{"text":"This place is very similar to Pieology at Downtown Summerlin. They offer just pizza and salads (and a s'more pie). Prices are reasonable as my wife and I got out with just a $23 bill for two pizzas and a small salad to share. My wife got her pizza a good 5-7 minutes before me, despite mine being made first. I thought at first it was because I got the high rise crust instead of the normal crust like my wife. But when I got it, they had made just a normal crust for me. I brought it to their attention and they quickly made the right one for me. They also gave me a free pizza card for the troubles. The place was clean but sort of loud. We would probably come back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place for anyone looking to indulge in pizza, that is customizable, lighter and thin! I also love how they show You the calories of each topping- helps me stay under control! 

The staff here are pretty friendly too!"}
{"text":"I had a pizza party here for large group (45) during Halloween and it was perhaps one of my best experiences hosting yet. Andrew and Katherine, the general and assistant manager, were extremely accommodating and professional. They took the effort to make sure our event was a success throughout the entire process. Before I even set foot into the restaurant, I already had a good feeling it was going to be amazing; I imagine it'll be hard to find better managers to bring your party plans to life.

Most people that pass by the restaurant will see it as just a normal pizza place (guilty) but this place has so much more to offer than your run-of-the-mill pizza parlor. From the moment you order your food to the moment you take your last bite, everything was flawless. Imagine a Starbucks/Subway hybrid setting: you line up to place your order, you are greeted by an exceptionally enthusiastic server that doesn't seem to rush (so friendly you might forget why you were there in the first place), you choose your toppings and to your surprise, they don't skimp on any of it! On top of all that, you notice they serve alcohol...beer and pizza, a combo sent from the heavens. Once you start eating, the word 'godsend' comes to mind. You'll forget all the other big pizza franchises in no time and come here on Yelp looking for ideas on what your next pizza will be. Many people at my party were thinking 'How can I finish an entire pizza on my own? I should share one with my buddy'... huge mistake. Blaze's pizza are healthy enough to not give you the stuffed feeling and for the first time in your life, you'll find yourself ordering a second one, 10 minutes after you finish your first. 

I could go on describing every inch of flavor and satisfaction Blaze Pizza can give but you really have to try it out for yourself. Think of it this way: how often can you find a pizza place in Toronto rated 4.5/5 with over a hundred ratings and reviews, all while being in the heart of downtown Toronto with a comfort level comparable to your home? I encourage you to go nuts with the unlimited option (same price as the preset options) and turn the world (this restaurant) into your oyster. I think I'd go as far as calling Blaze Pizza the Willy Wonka of pizza places."}
{"text":"Fast fresh pizza!. $6.25 for 11 inch one topping pizza or $7.65 for 11 inch with any toppings. You can choose your own sauce and cheese. Friendly staff, great service and I will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Great Price Great service and you can easily build your own pizza! I came here few times and never disappointed"}
{"text":"We were heading to ASU Gammage for a show and needed a quick bite to eat before heading in.  I had eaten at a Blaze in the Houston airport and was impressed, so decided to give it a try with my husband.  I ordered a build your own pizza with turkey meatballs and mushrooms and a blueberry hibiscus agua fresca - so tasty and just what I wanted that night!  To top it all off, the staff is beyond friendly and welcoming - great training and culture, for sure!"}
{"text":"I came here after hearing and reading rave reviews and quite honestly I thought it was average. I get the appeal and the concept, and think that it's definitely a good place to come to when you're in a pinch (i.e., running around campus) and needing a quick bite but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here when so many places offer a better quality selection of toppings and unique pizza's. 

For the price point, you pay for what you get and as a student this is definitely a plus. It's a good alternative to have, especially when it's just so simple to just grab a burger from one of the plethora of fast food places for the same price as well. 

The atmosphere is similar to any old fast food establishment, with the queue and then various tables scattered about. 

I'd recommend this place if you're after pizza that isn't from one of the standard chains and you'd want a bigger portion, as they're plate sized individual pizza's."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of the quality and speed but these guys nailed it.  I really like that it's one price and they don't nickel and dime you on the toppings."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some fast, hearty, economical, and scrumptious Food, look no further! Blaze is an incredible concept. Load your pizza up with whatever you're feeling up to (all 10types of meats and/or mix with loads of veggies)! Always feel welcomed when managers come by and greet customers, but sometimes less veggie friendly (with folks adding both meats and veggies without changing gloves... nonetheless, 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a \"make your own\" pizza type place, so this was a unique experience all around for me. We went one weekend day for lunch after we saw a very long line one day during their grand opening and decided we had to give it a try sometime. 

We were greeted and the staff member explained the process to us newbies. We decided to pick our own toppings. I mean...unless you only like cheese, you cannot beat the price of the pick your own toppings situation. I appreciated the great selection in sauces and cheeses which provides near endless mixing possibilities. We each picked our toppings, paid and then waited while our pizzas were baked.

My only real complaint, and this may seem not important (it is), but it was very loud inside the restaurant and all the employees (including the cashier and people working the line) were very quiet and hard to hear when they were asking me questions. I had to have them repeat themselves a lot and they seemed to be getting a little annoyed....Otherwise the service was great and everyone was friendly and helpful. 

The food was delicious! Though to be fair, if you don't like it, it is kind of your fault so how mad can you be? It was great that they had a lot of options for seasonings (including hot sauce) for after your pizza was done being cooked. I'm definitely a fan of this place and will be back, the price for what you get is pretty outstanding."}
{"text":"So good. Great topping options and crispy thin crust. How can you go wrong. Also super friendly!!"}
{"text":"Love that you can customize your pizza however you want. Prices are decent although a Gluten-free dough will set you back $11. This place never disappoints, friendly staff and quick advice."}
{"text":"Re:   I'm going to update my star rating because the owner reached out to me about my review.  I removed the original review as I revisited the store and everything had been corrected.    Thank you Blaze Pizza for the quick response."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about these type of pizzerias because I've tried pieology in California and thought it was pretty lame. I'd have to say Blaze Pizza is actually not that bad. It takes much better than Pieology. The sauce is what gets me with Blaze Pizza. You can never get a pizza as good as the ones you get in New York City. Living in the west coast for 8 years I've realized I can only tolerate thin crust pizzas here and the two best that I've experienced so far is Blaze Pizza and Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Charlotte. Gluten-free pizza is amazing and they offer to change their gloves and has the pizza on a separate pan. Workers are so nice and always make my day. This is a great modern, up beat, fast ordering and cooking, pizza place. You go through the line and tell them exactly what and how much of something you want."}
{"text":"We come to this location about once per month or so as a pre- mall walking meal.

Pros:

+Build your own pizza. Everyone is happy.
+They have entree salads now. I like the arugula & fruit and squash & quinoa salads.
+Ingredients are fresh and tasty.
+Food is reasonably priced.
+2/3 of the employees are friendly and helpful.
+Even when it's busy, they are working to keep the place clean and organized.

Cons:

+The other 1/3 of the employees. Almost every time we go, we encounter an employee who ate pissed-in Cheerios for breakfast. That type pops up in food service every now and then. I can only hope that they are having a bad day and that they don't live in that miserable state every day.

+There's no salt. It takes an act of Congress to get extra salt. It aggravates me to no end when places don't offer salt on the tables or in packets. I'm nearly 40 years old, I promise I can handle my salt.

Conclusion:

We'll be back. My family enjoys their pizzas, I like the blood orange lemonade and the salads, and the overall experience is always positive."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in town. The customer service I have experienced here is honestly great. They are always friendly and the one time I had a problem (there wasn't enough cheese), they offered me a refund and were super apologetic. Since it's so close to my work, I go there way too often and whether I'm picking up an online order or placing a new one, I always get great service. 

And then there's the pizza itself. There's just something so fun and exciting about a pizza bar like this where you can customize as you want. I always get this weird white pizza but add red sauce, Gorgonzola, and a pesto drizzle. It's somehow the tastiest thing in the world. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend love this place!!! Such fresh products and such a nice atmosphere when you walk in! They offer rewards every time you order which leads up to free pizza and sometimes treats! They have great fresh homemade drinks I can't get enough of this place! Sadly I got locked out of my blaze pizza app and can't get back in :("}
{"text":"I was going to make this review a long time ago but I didn't have the time. Went here because I was absolutely famished. I had two pizza's made for me. The first one comes out and it's great as always. The second one comes out and it's a little burnt on one end. Not that big of a deal. The man working the pan says \"oh no, i'll give you a good one, we'll remake it. The burned one is on the house\". I got to talking with the gentlemen and his co-worker and they were the nicest guys (I was having a bit of a rough day too). Their names were Pierce and Mark. I told them I would go on yelp to say they were \"absolute ballers\" and here I am. I go back just to see them. Grade A"}
{"text":"A special shoutout to Angelo for making my day! 

Blaze is my go to pizza place just because I love the fact that I can customize my own pizza. I'm not a fan of tomato sauce so having the other options are enticing to me. Choose a crust, then a sauce, meats, toppings and extras all for the affordable price of $7+

They also have a stamp card in the form of an app. After 10 purchases, you get one for free. Easily accessible! 

After they blaze your pizza, you can add last minute topping to it like pesto sauce, olive oil, etc. They usually have all their options listed on the counter. Take advantage because it's free of charge! You can also ask for ranch on the side or BBQ sauce, etc."}
{"text":"I absolutely love being able to customize my perfect pizza! 

Today was Pi Day, $3.14 per pizza/person so it was slightly packed at this location. Every so often they have some kind of discounted promotion so it always seems to be packed whenever I go. 

You start with a choice of crust, then on to the sauces, then the meats, then veggies and last but not least, add ons after they blaze your pie. 

I always get the white sauce because I'm not a fan of tomato sauce although this is the only place I know that has the spicy red sauce option for all those spicy lovers. Then I get every single sausage you can think of staying away from the pepperoni and bacon. Then mushrooms, lots and lots of pineapple, roasted garlic, spinach, basil, olives, oregano and into the fire it goes! Once it gets taken out of the fire, someone slices it for you but it doesn't end there. You can still add olive oil on top or pesto if you're being creative. 

A lot of places to sit, cleaned almost immediately after the last party leaves. Polite staff that comes around and checks up on you if you dine in and a well maintained drinks bar, and bathroom. 

Tip: Download the app to earn points for a free pizza and get updates on their current promotions. You can also order through the app and it sends it right to their register. I know this because I overheard an employee confirming if they received the online order."}
{"text":"First time to Blaze, love the pizza (BBQ Chicken)and service. Thought the kale salad was too sweet. Wish they were in Washington!"}
{"text":"Really the only non restaurant pizza in Vegas that's a 5 star. 
Flavor is good. I can tell they don't have sh*t like dominos. 
As many topping as u want (and they are not stingy on the toppings) for same price. 
I think this is the only place I'll eat pizza in Vegas. Ohh and 8$ for a personal pizza that for some people would be enough for 2. 
Really don't see a reason to eat anywhere else"}
{"text":"Review #300!

Pick a crust. Pick a sauce. Pick your choice of cheese (vegan option available). Pick your toppings (as much as you want, Subway style). Blaze it!

There are pre-sets if you don't feel creative enough to Build your own.

Pizza is prepared fresh as you order. Fast fired (hint: wifi password) so your pizza is ready in seconds. Crust is thin and crispy. Very friendly staff especially the dude at the blazing station.

Great experience overall. This is the best place in Toronto for personal pizza. I'm surely coming back next time I'm at Dundas with a case of the munchies."}
{"text":"This pizza is super tasty!!! Lots of choices (including gluten free & vegan), the service is pretty fast & the food just so delicious. Also you can add endless toppings for no additional charge. You can order online & pick up or enjoy it there as there are plenty seating choices available. Super convenient!"}
{"text":"This was some good pizza in Vegas.  You stand in line and design your own pizza which is quickly ready in less than 10 minutes.  It was pretty delicious."}
{"text":"I happened to stumble upon this new pizza joint after doing some shopping in the heart of Yonge and Dundas. Blaze is located in a convenient and busy intersection - which I always find myself ending up at every time I am downtown. My friend and I decided to give this place a go as we were craving pizza that day. 

Upon entering the restaurant, you can notice a spacious eating area with tons of seating available. Once you enter you are immediately greeted by a worker at the counter who asks whether you have visited them before. The first time we came here, the worker kindly gave us their recommendations and best sellers - which are the BBQ Chicken and Red Vine. You also have the option to build-your-own pizza and top it with as many, or as little, toppings are you please. They offer an abundant amount of ingredients, so the creations are endless! All their pizzas are $10.45+tax. What's also amazing is that their pizza only take 180 seconds to make, so your order will be done in little to no time. 

My friend and I opted for the BBQ chicken and Red Vine the first time we came here. Not even kidding when I say this, after the first bite, we literally died and went to pizza heaven. SO GOOD. All the toppings on both pizza go very well together. Not to mention, the pizza is crust, which makes it extra crispy! We just wanted to keep going back for more after the first slice. Highly recommend the Red Vine and BBQ Chicken. Usually I would never be able to finish one whole pizza on my own. But who am I kidding, to our surprises, we both were able to finish one on our own. They cut the pizza into 6 slices, so it is great for sharing if you're not super hungry when you come here. 

The second I came, I decided to build my own pizza. I topped it with their spicy red sauce, mozzarella, red onions, basil, mushrooms, red peppers, and oregano. Just as good as the first time I came here. Blaze has become one of my new favourite pizza joint in downtown Toronto. Highly recommend if you are ever in the area and are craving pizza. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 5-stars because they have an amazing pizza dough. Just the right thickness for a thin crust that is firm, not soggy, which you can actually hold with just one hand. My personal peeve is a soggy pizza requiring the use of utensils; as such, Blaze hits the mark!

A wide selection of toppings, but missing prosciutto (as I remind myself that I shouldn't be so picky). Having said that, I made my pizza to my desire, and it was absolutely amazing. 

The casual environment, ability to preorder with their app (along with points to redeem free drinks and pizza), and not pretentious as the other pizza restaurants will have me returning time after time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend dragged me to this place again. This experience was a lot better. The employees weren't crowding each other out. The tables were clean, beverage dispensers full, all in all the experience was more pleasant than last time. My pizza was cooked perfectly. The crust was so crispy. I was really pleased.  I still don't agree with the preparers having nose rings, but this experience was great."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have to resist from putting every topping on my pizza lol but if you really want to, you total can for the same price. I ordered half white top and meat eater. Then added more garlic, mushrooms and ricotta. The best part...it was cooked by the time I filled my drink and sat down.  

We had two pizzas, side Caesar, and 2 lemonade for 25 bucks! I ate the whole pizza. Don't judge me! Ok judge me. Judge all you want!"}
{"text":"Blaze makes some good pizza with Immaculate girth. Not to mention the workers we're very kind, espessialy kyle. However the tofu is gross."}
{"text":"People at the gym told me this was the place for a good healthy meal. Lo and behold they were telling the truth.  Made to order pizzas with choices of healthy toppings. Can't go wrong there Decided for ground turkey, grilled chicken breast, spinach, red onions, mushrooms, their signature lightly red sauce, and a touch of sea salt and oregano. Fired up to your perfection and there you go! A healthy pizza meal for lil ol me You have to try it!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places. It's like a chipoltle for pizza. The price is right, pizza is great, service is fat and friendly!"}
{"text":"Love to come to this place to grab a quick pizza pie hands-down the toppings everything that they put on the pizza is the best! I think of my own one of these joints!"}
{"text":"Give this place a try! I read reviews before my husband and I ate here. I was a little skeptical that we'd be waiting forever or that there would be a problem with the staff. However we were pleasantly surprised that both the wait and staff were great. Our pizzas were also delicious! I love the unlimited fresh toppings. My only suggestion would be to wipe down the topping area. It looked cluttered, but it also was wasteful. Other than that everything was great. The staff was nice, fast, and hard working. Also their regular crust is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is my next go to place downtown. What is there not to love, high quality ingredients, lovely crispy crust, and nice portion-all customizable at under $12 a pizza....a place for students and those professionals that are still living the student life. I love the ingredients that they provide...it's like AYCCE for one pizza. Gotta learn to contain myself from to oing over board but there are sooo many options and combination. The fire oven gives the pizza a nice crisp edge. Even though it is an individual pizza, we shared one to a pie and was stuffed beyond belief. I highly recommend to plan before lining up as people will begrudgingly glare at you if you are holding up the line (ahem, people who were ahead of us...I get hangry ya know). The staff was so friendly and patient. The restaurant is busy but the pace is quite good. I would recommend this to everyone and anyone that will listen to me."}
{"text":"Loving this place. The staff was friendly and attentive, and the pizza was delicious. The place was very clean and big, which was a huge plus for me. I got the Vine pizza and it tasted fresh and light. The price is reasonable and they use very fresh ingredients. I don't have anything bad to say about this place and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever?  No.  Awesome value for a pizza?  YES!

Tried this place based on Yelp reviews and were pleasantly surprised.  It's like a Chipotle for pizza and instead of your own personal burrito, you get a personal pizza (6 slices...which for me is 2 meals, but I've seen people eat it all in one sitting).  I like the art lover with some sea salt on top.  It really brings out the flavor of the ricotta and the artichokes."}
{"text":"Pretty neat place. Step up to the line build your pizza and then they cook it a few minutes. Toppings are good and the dough is average. Dough is pressed out not hand tossed. No major negatives just not OMG you must check this place out"}
{"text":"The best part about this place was the crust.  It reminded me of naan bread and I really enjoyed it more with each bite.

I didn't care for the sauce it was very sour.  The selection of toppings are good.  Because the pizza cooks fast on the bottom and slower on top with the toppings the pepperoni is very soggy.  I like my pepperoni pizzas to be crispy around the edges.  The roasted garlic is very under roasted.   It was actually still a bit hard.

It is very close to this location but out of all the make your own pizza type places that are popping up my favorite is Eklectic Pie."}
{"text":"Ive been to the one on the North side of Las Vegas and we just happened to be in Henderson and had to had to had to show my friends. 
I LOVE the concept. It is like chipotle/subway meets pizza. I mean customized pizza for about $8. Doesnt get better. They have the thin crust pizza that I love as well as my hubby. Also they had gluten free options for my friends that are gluten intolerant. 
Multiple base options to choose from: Meat lovers, Pesto, green pizza. And the best is the make your own. Sauces range from original red, to white alfredo to olive oil, to spicy sauce which my mexican friends loved. Also the cheese options are stupendous: Vegan cheese, blue cheese, mozerella, Goat cheese, ricotta and so many more. Also Meat options are one of the many options of UNLIMITED toppings! Sausage, meatballs, pepperoni, ham, salami, pretty much every topping you can think of. And then the other veggie options keep me even more happy: Whole roasted garlic is by far one of my favorites. 
The location is clean and the service is beyond my expectations. It kind of reminded me of going to Chick-afil where the people come around and asked you for drink refills, sauce refills, clean your table, etc. 
I love love love this place and is def my go to for pizza. I will be bringing more of my friends who visit here.
Also they have these cute boxes for to go. Amazing PIZZA and all to your own liking. Doesnt get better."}
{"text":"Very nice staff they had a slight hiccup but they made up for it with the s'more cookies! I would not hold that against them!"}
{"text":"My second favorite pizza joint ever! First one has to be Round Table Pizza...but sadly there are no franchises here in Canada to my knowledge. 

Anyhow! They fire these babies in an oven for I guess a few minutes or a bit more? Then bam! Your beautiful colorful pizza is ready!! I really prefer thin crust , and Blaze makes it to perfection which is why this place would be my number 2 go to pizza spot. You can choose their signature pizzas or design your own. I LOVE the Red Vine, and the Meat Eater, and I just pretty much always order my own.  It's pretty thin and not super heavy, so one pizza per person is definitely doable! (at least for Red Vine it is...) My only complaint is that I have tried the Green Stripe, and I would say it would be my least favorite pizza. Steer clear of that one, I really thought it was bland and tasteless. It's just mostly pesto, veggies, cheese...with some chicken pieces. Pretty mediocre. 

Service is friendly and prompt. Oh! And avoid lunch rush because no tables!!"}
{"text":"Did not disappoint!! Pizza, Prices on Point! Obsessed with there Blood Orange Lemonade!"}
{"text":"First time here, probably won't be back. Pizza is ok but it's exactly the same as Fired Pie. But Fired Pie has better pizza. They do have Blue Moon, which did make the pizza taste better. Too many pizza joints in this neighborhood. Spinatos will always be my favorite."}
{"text":"This is the chipotle of pizza. We don't have these on the east coast but someone needs to bring it there. I'm officially addicted. Incredible prices for fresh made pizzas. Amazingly fresh ingredients! Service is 5 star all by itself, employees kept checking up on us and they were so friendly and fast. I recommend this to anyone!!"}
{"text":"My brother and i llllllloooooovvvvveeeee pizza and I would say this place is pretty dope and delicious!! The service was quick and the food was great! I got the meat eater which is one of their special pizzas and my brother got the \"create your own\" and made it Hawaiian! Overall we loved the place and give it five stars!"}
{"text":"This is one of the new food places here in North Las Vegas. BLAZE is an assembly based build your own kind of pizza. Short and sweet. Good food and good on the price! I tried the build your own and built a ham and pineapple with olives. Try your own Blaze pizza today!"}
{"text":"The s'mores dessert is wipe it off the chin of your mouth good.  the high rise crust didn't really seem all that different from the flat.  It's made to order pizza & the variety or the variations are a bit daunting.  this is really thin crust gourmet pizza that you can do however you like.  it was clean & the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"AMAZING service, great employees. Returning customer forever! Megan & Xavier are amazing kind, hard working and the best employees that blaze can have."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie.... Blaze was pretty fire! 

This place is like chipotle for pizza! 

I got the create you own pie and loaded it up with every kind of meat they had. Food came out at timely fashion, and was eaten at one as well.

I was a little upset to see the place had no garlic powder  I need that on my life! 

I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time recently. Ordered online and went to pick up. Within the first five minutes of being there they had dropped someone's pizza and two people had brought back their orders. Also, the cashier was handling the money, holding a broom and handling the food all at once with semi gloved hands. Then he got confused about our pizza order so instead of checking the status, he just started ignoring us. Oh yeah and they don't clean the tables or chairs at all. Pizza sauce and cheese everywhere. So check before you sit down. Or better yet just go to another build your own place. My pizza was so soggy that water was dripping out of the box. Don't give in to the hype."}
{"text":"If you like thin crust pizza then this is your spot! 

Make your own, customize, add your fave toppings. Fresh ingredients, crispy pie and not soggy at all. After you go through your ingredients they throw it in the blazing fire pizza cooker and within minutes your pie is ready!

Everyone is nice and the place is pretty clean. Fairly priced as well...definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Cool new concept for an old favorite, imagine Subways build your sub idea but with pizza. they also have a few varieties to choose from or you can customize. The pizza is good for about two folks. They are thin crust pizzas and are ready very fast. Opted out for the barbecue chicken which was pretty tasty. Staff was friendly and prompt and the pizza was good."}
{"text":"1st timer at this place. The staff was friendly asking if we needed help with figuring out how they worked or any questions.  Got a create your own pizza and went down the line choosing toppings.  Also got garlic knots for myself and my daughter.  After creating they cook it in the wood fired oven.  Pizza was delicious.. and fairly quick which is great at lunch.  My favorite thing was they had several flavored waters and lemonades with the drinks.  I got a blood orange lemonade which was wonderful!! I loved that they had options besides soda or water and especially since I don't like a lot of caffeine the lemonade made a very flavorful choice.  The only negative I have (and it's not the restaurants fault) is the is very very little parking in the strip mall."}
{"text":"Amazing 3-5 min pizza! 
The set up for ordering is a like a chipotle/subway. They have a mixture of 8 pre made pizzas at $7.65 and then for the same exact price you can get an UNLIMITED topings for the same price. The crust is thin crust and it is super flakey and scrumptious! 
My friends got the green stripe last time and she said the pesto was too oily so I shy-Ed away from that. I'm all about the meat. I got a meat eater pizza with extra blue cheese, while garlic, sautéed mushrooms, red peppers. My friends got the white top. 
Total after taxes it was about 8$. Totally worth it for about 8 large pieces. 1 pizza can be shared with 2 people. 
Def would come here again!! 
Lunch time wait is about 15-20min. But one moves fast. 
The place is clean and the service was quick."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Blaze pizza and I must say it was great....Service was outstanding!!!I got the BBQ chicken pizza&my husband got the meat lovers and we added a few more toppings!!!Cant wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"For $11 you can build your own pizza with UNLIMITED toppings. My friend and I got one preset signature pizza and a build-your-own. I think I'm gonna stick to the build your own from now on.

We got the meat eaters pizza as the preset one. For the build-our-own we got mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, sauteed onions, spinach, peppers, ovalini mozzarella, roasted garlic, pineapple and original red sauce. We waited around 5 min for our pizza to cook in the stone oven and as it came out we got a bbq sauce finish and extra ranch sauce on the side to go.

I've gotta say, the crust was nice and thin. The pizza itself was so delicious. You can see the fresh, wet dough being made by someone in the corner behind the stone oven.

Overall, great location (right at dundas and yonge intersection; smack dab in the middle of central downtown basically), great service (everyone was efficient at their own station and friendly I might add), great price and great pizza! Skip the preset pizzas and BUILD YOUR OWN pizza. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Seriously, what is not to love about Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza? 

My family and I absolutely love coming here for a quick bite to eat for lunch while running errands or when ya know, we're too lazy to cook dinner at home! Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza is fast, affordable, and delicious!

For just $8, you can BYO pie with all of the toppings that your heart desires! You can't beat this deal. The combinations one could come up with are simply endless! There is a variety of sauces, cheeses, meats, and veggies to choose from. If you're not up to the Picasso challenge, you can also choose from one of their Signature Pizzas. Blaze even offers a gluten-free crust and high-rise dough! I prefer the original crust. It's crispy around the edges and the bit of charred flavor it gets from the oven is so good!

This location can get pretty busy since it's right next to Galleria. Shopping makes the people hungry! There's lots of room to sit and inhale your pie and even a patio to enjoy during the cooler Vegas days.

For those of age, Blaze offers select beer and wine too! Lots of craft favorites. And for those not of age, I highly recommend the Blood Orange Lemonade or the Blueberry Hibiscus agua fresca. Both are refreshing and complement the pizza nicely.

I love this place and it satisfies my pizza craving every single time!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of these make your own pizza spots.  I was excited when I saw Blaze was coming into my neighborhood.  I came during lunch.  There was a short line but it moved quickly.  I got a BYO Pizza, S'more Pie and Blood Orange Lemonade.  For my BYOP I picked shredded mozzarella, pepperoni, mushroom, olive and garlic on regular crust.  If you are like me and only get a few toppings you can ask them to put more on.  My pizza was a little sparse.  Still delicious but I could have used some a few more toppings.  I understand why they do it.  They don't know if I am going to add 20 more toppings to my pie.  They heated up the S'more Pie for me when they baked my pizza.  I thought that was nice.  It wasn't anything special to me though.  I would skip it next time.  All the employees I encountered were friendly and helpful.  Seems like they have a great staff."}
{"text":"We have visited Blaze Pizza so many times since they originally opened on Decatur and 215. It's seriously amazing! We love building our own pizzas and it's affordable for my whole family to enjoy. We've told friends, coworkers, and family about Blaze too- we've all been pleasantly surprised with the flavors, prices, and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love it! Though the line looks very long from the outside, the service is fast. I ordered a 2 topping pizza, grilled chicken and mushroom with the white creamy sauce, mozzarella, and finished with arugula. If you're not super hungry you can share one pizza among two people."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of the Pizza, only downside was I really wanted a beer but its totally non alcoholic. Flip side, the lemonade was on point!
For what you pay here its amazing, I would go again and recommend people to go."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time in New Jersey and loved it. I was so excited when I found out there was a new Toronto location. I highly recommend the Art Lovers or the White Meat pizza. It's in a great location too (on Dundas Square) and the servers are always friendly, helpful, and happy. Just don't go during lunch hour on a weekday."}
{"text":"Love pizza places like this.   I call it the \"subway\" of pizza places.   Great selection of toppings and food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Awesome first experience. Great service, great toppings and my pizza turned out amazing. The crust was nice and crispy too. For $10.45 and unlimited toppings, how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"This is where you go to be a Pizza Picasso. You can build a mountain of meats, a shrine of veggies or just a plain missionary pizza (pepperoni). 

Location: 5/5
Smack dab in South End and conveniently next to the light rail. Street parking isn't too bad after 5pm but no worries if you can't find a spot, Blaze validates for the parking deck.

Atmosphere / Ambiance: 4/5
Super casual. My normal dining attire here is a tank and shorts. I've never actually eaten here but they wouldn't mind if you dined-in sans sleeves. There's some tables outside also in case you want to catch some sun rays or people watch. You can steer at everybody being fit while you stuff your face with carbs. That's some good living.

Cleanliness: 5/5
Pretty clean, bright and modern.

Service: 5/5
As you make your way down the assembly line, everybody is nice, friendly and more importantly they don't skim on your toppings. 

Food: 5/5
Really good and filling. Unless you suck at picking toppings. If you fail at this life skill, your build-it-yourself pizza will be awful and there's no one to blame but yourself. I'd suggest going with one of the options on the board then."}
{"text":"This is a cool concept of quick-fire pizza. You can choose a pre-made one or DIY a pizza, which is cool. You get to choose dough, toppings, etc, and they fire it up real quick and in like 10 minutes you've got your very own delicious za! 
There was a long line up when I arrived but it moved quickly and the staff were very patient, nice, and friendly!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fast with friendly service.. Wait till you walk in and smell  the spices..  Wood fire usually puts me in a trance anyway"}
{"text":"Great food! I would give it 4 stars for the food, but the employees were very disorganized and the one employee that stands out to me was Heather. I understand frustration because of the confusion that was going on, but she was extremely rude to her fellow coworkers and was yelling at them rudely in front of all the customers. It was sad to see. I also found a black hair baked in to my crust"}
{"text":"Great pizza and an even greater staff! It was my first (and not last) time at Blaze. I built my own pizza and get this, you get unlimited cheese!!! Mozzarella, Parmesan and ricotta, what up! Ingredients were so fresh and the crust came out cooked to perfection.

Highlight of the visit was the staff. I was helped by Raye and she was lovely! Super helpful and patient with my indecisive pizza making skills. Hooked it up with sauces and made the experience one in which I'll be coming back. My barometer of a successful dining experience. Shoutout to Raye! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Quick & nice service, taste good & friendly on the wallet. 
Checked this place out yesterday for lunch. The pizzas are six slices, great to share. 
We ordered one of their signature pizzas and then a build your own. Overall tasted good. 
Personally I like the sauce to have a richer tomato taste, and I thought the pepperoni was salty. 
The fact that you can create your own, right in front of you is a great concept and its quick.. just 3 minutes in the oven. I'm sure we will be back soon. Especially when the weather cools down and can enjoy dining on their patio."}
{"text":"There is nothing I don't like about blaze pizza. 

1) fast pizza = pizza inside me sooner
2) unlimited toppings = more pizza to eat lol
3) fresh toppings = I feel like I'm eating high end pizza

My first time here was a date (he's my bf now so he can thank his good date spot choice hehe) I now go with my coworkers here sometimes because it is just so yummy!

I like how there were so many topping choices. It sounds logical but at Pi Co (Bay and bloor) I was surprised at how little choice I had (and for 3$ more!)

My favourite toppings are the zucchini and spinach. I think I've mentioned in past reviews how I don't like greens or veggies lol it basically is a sign for me that a place is doing something right when I want to have their veggies. 

I also like how they don't question what I want to put on it. I mention this bc the guy at Pi Co told me not to get more mushrooms since my pizza will be too heavy to cook. I wish I took a photo of the one from Pi Co hahah it was maybe 6 pieces of mushrooms a few really ugly looking pineapple pieces and sad sad chicken and he was worried my pizza would be heavy. Quite laughable. 

Anyway I like how blaze's oven cooks my pizza in seconds and I get more time to enjoy it.

I would suggest coming BEFORE the lunch rush because blaze just doesn't die down until lunch is super super over lol."}
{"text":"We definitely like the food. I mean like like. Very full of flavor and excited to taste every bite. 

However it was cold by the time we got to enjoy it. Word of warning, the register is a nightmare. Very confused staff charged other people food to our bill. Then proceeded to help people behind us while waiting for the situation to be corrected. At one point the lead cashier or manager told my wife that \"we will get to you when we get to you\". 

Even cold it was good but I really wanted it warm.  If they can get their stuff together they would be 5/5.  

Update:
It looks like the cashiering and checkout problems are a thing of the past. Been twice since and the service was great."}
{"text":"I like it a lot,  price is good and you choose your own toping. will go back for sure"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Blaze pizza! My family and I come here a couple times a month and I still wish I went more. The s'mores dessert is also so so sooo good! My go to is the whitetop pizza!"}
{"text":"I surprisingly really enjoyed this place since I'm not much of a fan for pizza or fast food. The service was great and pretty quick considering it was pretty busy. Staff took the time to visit us at our table (and others) to ensure everything was okay when they weren't too  That doesn't happen often at fast food joints. 
We ordered our own build-it-yourself pizzas. I like this option because I like random combinations on my pizza. (II would highly recommend the pesto sauce base.) 
We also tried the new aqua-fresca drinks.  I personally only liked the blood orange one but if you like lemonade it's pretty good. 
I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'd never heard of this place until I was recommended it by a friend. At first I thought \"meh it's just pizza, how good can it be?\" But it was hyped up so much that I decided to give it a try.... And now I am adding to that hype! You really can't go wrong with anything you get here - it's about $12 for a pizza that you can literally put any amount of any toppings you want on. And it's ready in less than 5 minutes! If you don't want to create your own pizza, they do have other fixed pizzas - some of which were a few dollars cheaper. Personally, the value of making your own pizza is too good to get anything else. Also don't forget to download the app - you get free drink when you sign up!"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant by chance and thought hmmmm, I haven't had pizza for quite a while.  How do they fare on Yelp? Really great reviews, and they have an online ordering system? Sweet. It was super easy to use. You do get an email saying that they will prepare your pizza for you by your requested time, but will not fire it up until you check in with the cashier. Once I showed up at my requested time the cashier got my order prepared in a few minutes.

I used the custom built option and chose about 15 toppings.  I like that it was spread out proportionally so you don't have a pile of meat and vegetables on the thin crust.  It maybe skimpy to some, but it was just enough for me.  The crust.  Oh my gosh, it was perfect.  It is exactly what I like - thin, crispy, flavorful, cooked just right.  Toppings - huge selection and there's pretty much everything you want - common and gourmet selections.  Just so many options! Unfortunately they forgot to add fresh arugula on mine (they added it on my friend's) and I didn't see until I got back to my destination, but that's ok - next time I will be sure to check before I leave.  Oh did I say this only cost $10.45? One price, all the toppings you want? And it tasted amazing? Check check check.

I also got the smores cookie to try and my son said it was really, really good (and then ate half).  Simply made but taste great.  

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good pizza, cooked over fire. You can order different pizzas off their menu or create your own from an array of interesting toppings. Great concept. Side note, excellent blood orange lemonade...

In my opinion, a downfall of their concept is no call in orders. You order in person or online & they won't start the pizza until you walk in. The last time I tried to order online 30 minutes before they closed & my order wasn't accepted. I went across the street to their competitor with a very similar concept. But their competitor will take an order up to their closing time. You should be open hours that you state you are open. 
The same thing happened when i walked in 20 minutes before closing. It didn't seem like a manager was present, if so I was unable to tell who it would be. Employees were standing around talking & it was too late to make pizza. They were obviously ready to get home. 

Pizza was 3 1/2 but declining business during hours you state you are open is 0 stars. I have stopped going here due to this."}
{"text":"Create your own all for $7.95! Best deal ever and the Pizzas are the bomb!!! Just right on the crunchy for the bottom leaving the crust half way between soft and crunchy! PERFECT!!! Yum! We also had side salads, which I watched evaporate by two tweets! Looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"Madison is amazing, her care in creating my pizza makes for this being the most delicious pizza I have ever eaten. Pizza made with love is from the heavens. 
I LOVE BLAZE  PIZZA?"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: this was a postmate order from pick up to consumption was about 15 minutes.

Ordered a make your own pizza with gluten free crust and vegan cheese. The pizza initially looked appealing, I love thin crust pizza. It tasted slightly artificial and the crust was a bit rubbery almost. Very poor display of toppings. I am lactose intolerant and sometimes just load up on toppings in lieu of cheese. I don't think that would be advisable here. I could barely make out where the applewood bacon was!

However it was $8. Honestly I would much rather pay more for a pizza with decent amount of toppings.

Highlight: the smores cookie was amazing. I wish I just ordered two and called it a day."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat for sure!!! If I was stranded on a desert isle with only one choice for meals to eat....it  would most definitely be pizza.  

The Blaze concept mirrors another well known burrito place based in Denver Colorado.  You start by waiting in a usually waiting in a line with at least 10-15 people.  Don't worry it will move fast and it is well worth the wait.  

1st choice- sauce traditional red, white cream, or spicy red
2nd choice- cheese- mozzarella 2 types, parm, goat, feta, goat, or gorgonzola or vegan cheese
3rd choice- meats - sausage, pepperoni, meatballs, ham, bacon, chicken, and turkey meatballs
4th  choice- veggies - artichokes, olives, kalamata olives, banana peppers, onions, cherry tomatoes, basil, spinach, garlic chopped or roasted, mushrooms, pineapple, oregano, and red peppers. and I am sure there is more.  

Your delicious masterpiece goes into the oven and if you like it can be finished with 5th choice - Arugala, bbq sauce, pesto, or olive oil.  

Any way you build your own it will be AMAZING!!. For just $7 and some change.  They offer some of their own concoctions so you don't have to do the brain thinking in a high pressure environment because it feels like you are holding up  the line while building your pizza.  Either way Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza is awesome and I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"It wouldn't be justifiable if I don't update my review and its been due for sometime.  Yes going up from 2 to 4 honest stars now (Hey shut up! its not because I got passes for free pizza from Justin, after my first not-so-good experience).
First of all, shout out to Justin from Blaze's team.  He reached out to me via Yelp messenger and offered me couple pizza passes as an apology for me not having a great first experience at Blaze's (in my initial review I would have complained of burnt pizza).  I mean, I was taken aback with the gesture.  Who would go to that extent to please a customer, especially when its already a 4star reviewed?  I am super impressed with the customer service and Justin's gesture.  Blaze is for sure in the pizza business for a long haul.
Thank you for being kind and doing what is right to please your customers.  
Our second time - now we know how it works, it was easier than the first to choose and ask what we needed and our pizza's came out with nice and crispy edge with delicious toppings and we honestly enjoyed the taste more this time.  Like I always believe its just not the food but the whole package that makes a food place a great success and heck Blaze is definitely in the right path.
Cheers Blaze team!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Blaze pizza tonight. My son was very upset that the second time in less then a month, they where out of chicken. No BBQ chicken pizza for him. He went to go grab something else and Megan came by wiping down tables and cleaning up. She was very friendly and asked how we where doing. I mentioned my concerns about no chicken. She said let me go check and I'll be right back. She returned momentarily and said we had chicken in the back and I'll bring you out a BBQ pizza in a couple of minutes and please don't worry about paying I will take care of it for you. This was an example of excellent customer service! I also work in the F&B business and really appreciate it when someone actually takes responsibility and takes care of the customer! Thank you Megan!"}
{"text":"Highly over-rated, frankly.  Good concept but tastes like chain food pizza.  Not terrible but for 10 bucks for a small pie there are so many better choices."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I went here about a week or two ago and I was very satisfied. I had the white top, and I wanted something sweet to go along, so I got the smores treat. I think there should be a kind of dessert pizza, but it was still very good! The staff works very fast, and I love how friendly they are."}
{"text":"Nice set up...Friendly clean 

Relaxing atmosphere and they serve beer too...

10.45 all the toppings you can fit...

Will be coming back..."}
{"text":"I got the BBQ Chicken Pizza. Very tasty. Root beer is good too. Quick service. I took it to go"}
{"text":"The place is still awesome. Visited during peak hours this time. No issues at all. 
Glad to see kalamata olives, and basil garlic pesto added to the choice of toppings. 
Keep it up blaze!"}
{"text":"Dope concept. Walked in, chose my crust, sauce then unlimited toppings. There are some pizzas you can choose from but take your shot at creating your own. Your pizza is a larger personal size which is crisped to perfection. I may be in denial but the flame thins out the crust which means less calories right?"}
{"text":"I love this place because the pizza is worth the value!

Blaze is a flat rate customizable pizza place that gives you control over your toppings and your meal. The concept is wonderful and currently the price is less than 8 dollars for an individual pizza. The size is decent and I usually bring leftovers home after eating.

You start off your pizza adventure by using either one of their listed concoctions or plan your own. They offer gluten free crust and all their pizzas are a nice flat crust pizza. Which means half the calories! You go through the line and you can add as many toppings as you want for the same price. I usually start with the white top and add some extra vegetables to the mix. 

They then cook the pizza in a 1000 degree oven and it is ready in minutes! Usually I don't trust pizza places where the items sit out in a line but I have never gotten sick from their pizza and they do such a great job. They have free parking at this location but it is limited. They offer add-ons such as salad, desserts and of course drinks. 

The atmosphere is relaxing and has a very sleek look to the restaurant. Overall I love Blaze and they offer amazing customer service. 

So for those of you who fight with your spouse on which pizza to get like I do, this is your new solution where everyone wins. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good. The service is excellent (friendly, helpful and fast) and the ability to customize your pizza at such a low price is amazing. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I can't believe how fast they can prepare a pizza here.  The toppings are fresh and tasty.  I opted for the thin crust pizza.  I wish I had chosen the thicker crust. The pizza was good!  I like the wood fired taste.   This is a loud restaurant and it is pretty much self serve. I liked their varied selection of teas here.  If you want a quick meal, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Nice concept, quick and reasonable pizza for one or two person.  I like the taste and the place is not complicated, simple dine in or take out."}
{"text":"Passing through dundas square today and I come across BlazePizza, I don't know how i have not been in the place before, you can get a Build Your Own Pizza for approximately $13 and get any toppings that you would like on it. and the flavour of the pizza blows my mind I have never had anything like this before with the sweetness of the roasted garlic and green peppers mixed extremely well with the spicy red sauce, So good. The staff is remarkable as well, I was half way through my meal and one of the staff introduced himself as Chris was the most helpful by grabbing me a Takeout back and he also refilled my cup for me. I was really pleased with the service today. I will be returning. :)"}
{"text":"This is not \"fast\" fired. I tried to do an order online and website was not working. They were not going to do a phone order at first until I explained the issue. I called in the order and it was JUST being put in the oven 35 mins after it was ordered and they were not busy at all and had plenty of workers. Pizza is good, but there are a LOT of good pizza places in Charlotte and we will not be back if the service is going to be like that. They are also VERY small for the price. Very disappointed because we were really looking forward to this new place."}
{"text":"So this was my first time trying out Blaze today and I wasn't at all disappointed. Great service, great flavor and pizza toppings, as well as great drinks! The line was pretty long and did take a while to get our orders in but hey, I can see why. Definitely worth the wait and will definitely be returning (:"}
{"text":"I love Blaze Pizza!!! The staff is friendly, helpful and lots of fun.  I appreciate their  fast service and high quality food."}
{"text":"Its like Subway but for Pizza. 
You can do great things with your pizza, and its a major upgrade from regular Pizza. 
A bit crowded though, so not a very nice place to eat out with friends."}
{"text":"Gave this place a 2 star bcuz of the friendly pizza maker Dude but what a crappy product they have...yuck!

One person pizza style that you can \"build-ur-own\" or order from menu board...with only one size!  I ordered the cheese and the other - the pepperoni and a salad of tomato, mozzarella and balsamic dressing....it was bad Cardboard tasting crust and the salad was small and wimpy...:(((

Good thing was that they were accommodating and helpful so nice service saved this place from being and disastrous experience but man, this is bad pizza and I cannot believe that it's a restaurant chain with other locations....:/....never again and I hope people get smart and support the \"family owned\" pizza joints....!!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot to come if you're looking for a quick pizza bite, and by bite I mean your own smaller pizza pie. The pizza cooks fast and it's ready before you know it. Before I blinked it was sitting in front of me. 

Let's just say I devoured it all in one sitting. The employees are great and very friendly. So many tables to choose from too, so you're not sitting on top of each other."}
{"text":"Being able to build my own pizza is pretty neat and I can do it online too! Everything is very intuitive as you can see all toppings right on the spot and the employees are prompt in asking what you would like. The pizza is also done very fast as it's thin crust.

If you're really hungry, the pizza might not be filling but I highly recommend it if you're just grabbing a bite before or after a movie (it's next to the theatre) or in between work. You get what you're looking for when it comes to a casual pizza."}
{"text":"If you had Pieology it's very similar! It's a great concept! Choose what you want along the way!  Cheap delish pizza! It's too bad you can't chose your dough. Pile on all your choices. So good. Thing crust and bakes quick!"}
{"text":"Great pizza here! The crust is thin and perfect and you can add unlimited toppings on your pizza for $11. Plus you only have to wait about 5 minutes and it's ready to eat. You can add toppings like they do in subway, but if you're feeling lazy or indecisive you could just pick one of their menu items too."}
{"text":"Very nice. The staff is super friendly and the pizza was very nice. I think the build you own pizza is probably the way to go. You basically can load you pizza with as many toppings as you want. I think they have nice seasoning on all their toppings and the crust is so nice and thin and crispy. I think the pizza is a good size and I usually share one with a friend. I think I'll be coming hear regularly. Tip: the riccotta and the other cheese in the water is a bit wet so it makes the pizza a bit watery and the dough a bit soggy."}
{"text":"Honestly, I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked into Blaze Pizza. There was a short line at 8 on a Wednesday so I didn't have much time to study the menu. I went with a pretty basic Build Your Own pizza and while it was a bit overwhelming the first time my pizza was fantastic. 

The pizzas are a good size (I had to take half home) and very reasonably priced.

I took off one star because while the pizza was great actually getting your pizza was frantic and not well organized. Hopefully this aspect will improve."}
{"text":"Between the two Blaze pizza stores that I've been to, I like this one better.  Things just seem cleaner, friendlier, faster... simply, better! A good value with a 1-topping coming in at $6.50 and $8 for unlimited toppings. You really can't go wrong here.

I see that Blaze has added a \"Take Two\" option to their menu as well. For $8 you can get a half pizza and either garlic knots or a side salad. Pretty reasonable so that you can get a taste of either one of their sides but I would warn you that the side salad is more like a fist-full of salad, it's really, really small! I would rather just load up a monster pizza than go this route, but to each his/her own.

The Agua Frescas are really good as well, since you pay for the cup and the fountains are on your side of the counter, you can try them all if you'd like. I found the Mango too tart, and the Coconut too Sweet, but combine them and they are awesome!

Fast & Friendly staff, good reasons to visit this place. If they had sun-dried tomatoes as an option it would be damn near perfect, but considering the dozens of unlimited toppings you can choose from, there's no complaints here."}
{"text":"Decent pizza and staff is friendly just feel they put very little on the pizza example is I feel and it looks like they only put what is the equivalent of a slice of cheese on the pizza which is extremely little this is the same with each ingredient."}
{"text":"This pizza place is amazing. It definitely does not taste like a \"fast food\" pizza. The ingredients seemed very fresh, the dough was thin and crispy. The fact that you can only pay 10.45 for an unlimited amount of toppings is amazing. 
The only problem, and the reason why I did not give the full 5 stars is because I noticed that the person making my pizza did not change her gloves after she touched the meat toppings, and mine was a vegetarian pizza. Maybe some people do not care about this, I personally do. But overall, this is a great choice for an amazing pizza at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Really good.  Love the idea of creating your own.  Size was just enough.  Great for takeout!"}
{"text":"Great ingredients. Tastes awesome. Good amount of food for the price. I like having unlimited toppings too!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this pizza. We ordered to go, the pizzas were a bit look-warm when we got home. Nevertheless, they were amazing. Great taste, great crust, lots of choices (even gluten free) and a fun friendly enviorement. Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"I've had blaze before but now that I do not eat dairy cheese, I frequent it even more. I love that they are one of few pizza joints that offer vegan cheese and ingredients. There are a ton of ways to personalize your pizza and so far the staff has been outstanding. Even after visiting once, the young lady at the register who's name I am forgetting, recognized me the next time and called me by name. My wife and I partake in a blaze pizza at least once per week and ordering online to pickup and skip the line is the best thing since sliced bread."}
{"text":"Has the potential to be great and I've had some pretty decent pizza here. Unfortunately, today's pizza was not so great. The oven might be turned up too high because my pizza came out burnt. I asked for a remake and while it looked better on top, when I came home to eat it, it was still burnt on the bottom! I would like my pizza without a side of carcinogens, please. Thank you very much!"}
{"text":"I guess you could say my first experience with Blaze was brief... which would make since given their namesake (Fast-Fire'd Pizza). The pies themselves we're great given their price-point, but the service was a bit lacking.

After giving their neighbor, City BBQ, a try a couple of days ago, the large crowd at this new pizza joint intrigued me. I decided to skip the line and order online. Their online interface, by the way, actually works well! There are many take-out places around that have ordering apps or websites that make you believe they don't even want you ordering from them, so good on you Blaze for actually making it usable.

15 minutes after placing my order, I skip the massive line (love doing that anywhere I can!) and straight to the \"Pick-Up\" register. 2 employees we're working the register and 1 appeared to be cutting pizzas specifically for pick-up orders. After repeating my name 3 times, one to each employee who each sequentially looked at the next person like they didn't belong on that register, the guy cutting pizzas said he had my order and was cutting it.

I had 4 pizzas and he pointed to 2 boxes and said he was working on the other 2. Once my stack has accumulated to 4 I thought he would call me, after a minute or so I asked if they were ready. He said Yes, and nothing else. Grabbed my pizzas and walked out.

The whole \"customer-interaction\" part of the restaurant... it needs some fine-tuning here. I think if I hadn't said anything to anyone they wouldn't have batted an eye and I might still be there waiting on those pizzas! I'll dine in next time and see if things change. Who knows, it might have been a rough night?

So on to the pizzas. Their ingredient list is extensive, I bet you could make trillions of different combinations. The pizzas are 11\", a little bit bigger than your average \"personal\" pan, and hover around the $6-7 price range. They're going to make a killing off the college kids looking for value.

When comparing them to other budget pizza offerings around, it was outstanding! Great red sauce with that had nice spicy tang at the end. Meats (I got the meatball, salami, and pepperoni on mine) were all individually distinguishable and flavorful. Cheese was generous on my pie and great as well.

If the service is better next time, I'll be the best long-term customer they have. This is now likely the closest pizza place to the house, and while I like it, I want to LOVE it! Update Pending!"}
{"text":"First time at this location.  Prep counter staff speed very slow.  The prep guy then was at the register wearing his gloves and handling money.  Not OK.  Pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Blaze Pizza. They have high standards of quality and consistency, are very friendly; and of course have delicious pizza. The Pizza Pizza's and Pizzaiolos of the city should be pretty concerned if this chain decides to expand in Canada.

The best things about Blaze:
- the pizzas are so delicious and a fair price
- very friendly and warm customer service
- fast fast fast. The pizza production line is very efficient and the pizzas only take 180 seconds to cook.
- the build your own pizzas are a fixed price with unlimited toppings and add-ons
- the half pizza boxes for take out if you want to save some for later
- a decent array of salads, desserts, premium pops and wine/beer
- they are only so happy to remake your pizza if it comes out imperfect in the end
- good customer app with ongoing discounts and promos

Give this place a try. You will usually find it busy (very popular with the Ryerson students and Yonge-Dundas foot traffic) but fortunately it fills and empties quickly. There are tables to eat at, bathrooms and free wifi. The staff are good about clearing tables so it maintains an acceptable level of cleanliness for this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Burnt first pizza, had to keep friends waiting almost 10 minutes for new pizza. Clearly, no priority was given and they did not consider my friends were waiting for me. Second pizza undercooked. Inconsistent and did not really give a legit care about it. Saw them burn two others while I waited. Disappointed.

Update: went back and it was great. Much better."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Blaze and everything was great! Right when I walked in, I was greeted and asked if I've been there before. The crew took time to explain exactly how the process works which I appreciated. I adjusted the specialty White Top pizza and added pepperoni and mushrooms. The crust is thin and delicious, but I want to try the thicker crust next time. The lemonade was tart and sweet and it definitely satisfied my pizza craving. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Yay! New location opened up in Summerlin! It's located in the same plaza as Canes and it looks soooo nice! Same great interiors and an added large outside patio area. My boyfriend and I shared a BYO pizza. We told the person who made our pizza that we wanted rose sauce and she looked totally confused. I guess people don't order that often enough yet or she's just new to pizza. But we told her it's red and white sauce mixed together. The pizza was delicious as usual and I love their lemonades! One thing that would be better is that they should change the location of the napkin dispensers. From where I was sitting/standing I could not locate it. I had to ask one of the employees for them and he pointed next to the soda machines. They were totally hidden from my site! But overall, I love the pizzas and closer location!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing pizza experience!! Everything is so delicious! So many pizza toppings to choose from, as well as sauces! The pizza comes out so hot & flavorful & FRESH! :) 

They also have VEGAN pizza options and are so accommodating with any type of special orders or possible food allergies. They even ask if you want them to change their gloves when applying your vegan cheese! Amazing!! 

But my favorite thing about this place is the incredible & extremely friendly staff. From all the hard workers on the pizza line to the cashiers to the bussers, everyone is just sooooooooo nice, considerate & helpful. I didn't get everyones names but I did happen to get BROOKS name when he came over and ask how my pizza tasted! Wonderful customer service given by such a personable staff. 

Will definitely be coming back here for more amazing pizza & friendly conversation with the staff"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! The pizza is so amazing and every single topping tastes extremely fresh! The food is most definitely worth coming back! But what stood out to me even more than the great food was the service! Everyone was so friendly & personable & seemed so happy to be a part of the Blaze family. Eddie, Natalia, Courtland & Malik are customer service superstars & they deserve to be recognized for going above & beyond for their customers! :)"}
{"text":"The best custom pizza place you could ever go to! The ingredients are fresh each day and taste so amazing. Plus it's ready in just minutes. Amazing customer service. Great atmosphere. If I could eat here every single day I would. If you haven't tried it yet, it is a must! I have yet to meet anyone who doesn't love it!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a casual quick bite. The price is very reasonable to build your own pizza ($7.95) and you can get as many toppings as you like! One \"build your own\" can be shared by two people but we usually build two and take home leftovers for later! I wish they had more locations! The staff is also friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Unfortunately if you are a GF pizza eater, this place probably just going to be ok for you. For a GF pizza, add $4.40 to your standard wheat pizza, so it can total up to $18 for pizza. 

The variety of toppings were excellent. I was really pleased with the number of toppings you can put on your pizza.

If they didn't charge so much for GF, it would've gotten an extra star from me."}
{"text":"Tried Blaze Pizza for the first time today.  Staff was very friendly, pizza was very good and the price was very reasonable.  We like our pizza crust very crispy so we always ask for the pizza to be cooked very well done.  It was cooked perfectly.  We used to frequent Pieology often but after today we have become Blaze Pizza fans.  Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"I must give props to @blazepizza so I had a free pizza I had earned, I was saving it. Then the app popped up a free blood orange lemonade for Halloween so I head over. I go out on a limb and order something I would never order, let's just say I have a new fav pizza you BBQ chicken (I added ricotta) it's so good!! Omg they let me earn a new flame, they let me use my free pie, they gave me the free drink (which again is delicious and I never would've pick it)...cost $0 happiness a million. Oh and David checked on me and smiled and everyone is so nice. Thank you Blaze in Henderson, NV #howdoyoublaze I have zero affiliation and a full, happy belly!"}
{"text":"Great pizza with awesome service. We are visiting from San Francisco,  and know our way around blaze. This location is very nice,  clean and the dough is fresh. 

Loved our pizzas,  the attention to detail as well as the staff walking by and checking in on us and if we needed any sauce or such."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, variety. I love this place. Where else can you get an individual pizza with unlimited toppings for under $8? Crispy crust with spicy sauce and quality toppings. Count me in! No fighting over pizza toppings at home!"}
{"text":"The scent of hot and fresh pizza hits you as soon as you walk in and the enchanting smell will leave you salivating for your own pizza. Seriously, if you're with other people, get your own. Service is fast and efficient. It's like the Chipotle of pizza chains. I can see why Lebron James backed this company. 

Rejoice vegans! They have daiya cheese if you're in the mood for some cheesy pizza. 

Definitely one of the best pizza places in the area and great value for what you get. Why spend $15 on a mediocre at the mall when you can get a personalized pizza from Blaze right across the street?"}
{"text":"Always great people working here. Always friendly. Good pizza that you can customize. We love it! Never have had a problem or issue that wasn't resolved."}
{"text":"Their pizza has been delightful and their staff is quite helpful. I usually order gluten free and the staff is happy to change gloves and is very willing to customize. Vegans and gluten free alternative diet peeps will love this place."}
{"text":"FIRST TIMER EXPERIENCE: 
LOVED IT! They are so friendly from the second you walk in the door. Coming to a new place that's so important. We didn't know how the process worked and they were patient and walked us through it! You pick out you dough, cheese, and you get as many toppings as you could possibly want for no additional charge! They make sure you are pleased with your pizza, you will get asked multiple times if everything is tasting okay or if you need anything. They are on top of cleaning. The pizza TASTE AMAZING! Everything about this place was great. Loved it. We will be back again! 

OH & if I had to make one personal suggestion on another topping option... I would ask them to include asparagus that would make this place even better!"}
{"text":"Awesome, delicious, fast pizza.  It's so good and what a great price!!!  I will never order delivery pizza again!"}
{"text":"Another addition to this NEW and CROWDED Pizza Segment, that is build your own Quick fired Pizza- ala Chipotle style . What's best about this concept is you get the pizza just the way you want it without paying $1.10 for each different topping.

You have probably been to one of these, 1000 degrees, My Pie, Mod, Fired Pie and/or several others that are growing locally and Nationally. Thus enter BLAZE, the newest addition to the Valley.

The Pizza and Hospitality I received today was great. It's a super nice, friendly and competent staff, and some great fresh toppings with an excellent variety.

The place was packed to the rafters and I would estimate they were cranking out about 4 pizzas a minute. They cook quick, 180 seconds, I was gleefully told.
 I did notice the slicer trimming the edge of a slightly over cooked pizza. Mine however was baked just right.

What surprised me was the excellent slightly smoky flavor, it was so good. I wasn't expecting that from a gas flamed oven. Every topping cooked well and the cheese was great quality. The cheeses were excellent and delicious!!! Don't change a thing!!!

The Unit was fresh and open with wood tables and concrete floors. The table I chose wasn't cleaned yet, but it was clear, not really a problem since I chose it and there was a dining room attendant working hard.

Beverage station was above average and I tasted most of the fresca's, lemonades, and natural sodas in the 180 plus seconds it took to bake my pizza. The beverages might be one of the things that elevates Blaze above the others. I settled on The Blood Orange lemonade that was just a tad to sweet by the time I got to the bottom of the cup. Mint lime fresca was refreshing but I didn't want to commit to a full cup.

I Really like Blaze. How can you knock a really good pizza and drink for 10 bucks. I'm a pizza snob/Pizziolo. There are so many great pizza places out there, but I for sure will be back here! Good Luck and keep up the good work.

Managers; Solid opening and you have a great crew! Congratulations... get some sleep"}
{"text":"Oh wow! Blaze is my new favorite pizza place, plus it's a 5 minute walk from my place. This could be bad. I got a little too excited when I got here so I ordered so many toppings. 

I got the build your own pizza: Spicy red sauce, shredded mozzarella, grilled chicken, turkey meatballs, artichokes, banana peppers, olives, oregano, roasted garlic, and jalapeños with a side of ranch. It was cooked to perfection. The crust was light and crispy. I also put red pepper flakes and Parmesan on top, which was on the table. Oh it was so good! They have a ton of toppings so you could come here multiple times and never order the same thing. But the real winner was the turkey meatballs. I talked about how awesome they were on the pizza for about 10 minutes till my husband shut me up. Ugh so good! 

The blood orange lemonade was also equally as awesome, plus they had small salads available. The goat cheese and beet salad sounded amazing. You can easily order a side salad and split the pizza with another person (that's what the people behind us did), but I was to greedy and got my own- plus had leftovers. They also have an outdoor area so feel free to bring the pups. 

Overall great time at Blaze and I can't wait to me go back!  5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service By Ricky and the entire staff today

Always prompt service 


fresh every time"}
{"text":"We normally love this place and have had good  experiences up until the last two times we have been in. Both times our pizza has been way undercooked, even though we specifically asked for them to be cooked longer after it happened the first time. I'm not sure who the kid is cooking the pizza 12/19/17 around 7 pm, but he should be moved to the ordering line while someone else cooks. Now I have to take my pizza home and cook it more, just like I did last time I was here. We will try PizzaRev next time."}
{"text":"So I was craving pizza, but didn't want the usual Downtown suspects: Pizza Pizza, Sbarro, Mama's Pizza, Pizzaolli(probably spelt wrong..sue me). So I came to my trustworthy Yelp for suggestions and up popped Blaze Pizza. 
First off, I loved the fact that i place my order online, and give them my order number upon arrival, pay and then they cook it fresh. Clever idea. 
Secondly, $10.45 for unlimited toppings....oh happy day!!!!
I had jalapenos, kalamata olives, feta cheese, spicy tomato sauce, bbq sauce, Italian sausage, bacon, roasted red peppers, ham, and spinach on a thin crust. This would have cost way more at any other pizza joint.
180 seconds later....voila!!!!!! Fast...right!!!!!
I took the first bite...I was like OMG!!!!!! This was an amazing pizza. I will definitely be going there again.
The staff was super helpful and very friendly.
Thank you, Blaze was for being so good!!!"}
{"text":"Blaze, why did it take me so long to find you when I only live 10 minutes away?

I'll skip all the \"I came here for dinner one night\" nonsense and get straight to it. The concept is like a Subway, but for pizza. You order your crust and sauce first, then move down the line for cheese, meat and veggies. You pay for your meal, which comes out to be under $9 for a personal pizza that lasts 2 meals for most people. 

The ingredients are always fresh. You can ask for more of whatever you want if they get skimpy with something. Like, who puts 3 basil leaves on a whole pizza? You better believe I asked for more. I've never had to wait long for our pizza to bake and have never had to fight for a table. Although I can imagine the cluster f**k during peak lunch and dinner times. 

Three small things I don't like about this place. One kid butchered my name when he wrote it on the paper lining. \"Mearie\" as he spelled it. Nice one guy even after I spelled it out for you. I don't like their ranch at all. Idk what it is, but it's absolutely disgusting. And their agua frescas taste like nothing. 

They still get 5 stars from me because their pizzas are effing delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just an update to my prior review. I mentioned that the pizza will get soggy if not consumed immediately. However,  I discovered today that when the crust is flaccid, it begins to resemble a pita wrap. The taste and texture is delightful."}
{"text":"The \"Subway\" of pizzas. You can build your own pizza and have whatever crust, base and toppings you want for one price! Its my own gourmet pizza with a unique combination each time... I loved the ricotta, artichoke, roasted garlic, seasoned zucchini on mine. Just remember, less is more. There was even an option for a drizzle of pesto, olive oil or balsamic on top. Or for those wanting something easy, they have their signature pizzas to choose from. 

And the crust... I normally don't like thin crust because it gets soggy, but this one was so crispy and chewy! A little on the greasy side, but really good. I noticed that they even put a calorie count on all individual items which is a nice touch. Great location as well, at Yonge and Dundas. I may have enjoyed this as much as Pizzeria Libretto..."}
{"text":"Love the thin crust, choice of signature pizzas and build your own pizza options. Getting fed in 5 minutes  (2 minutes to top the pizza and 3 minutes to fire it up) will always be a winner to me. It's very hard to 'top' a good quality,  simple and tasty pizza right out of the oven. See what I did there."}
{"text":"Extremely stingy with ingredients, as corporate tells their employees to be. The man in front of me asked for more cheese to be put on 3 times. You wait 15 minutes from the time you arrive until you get your pizza, assuming there's not a line. They'll suffer the same fate as Chipotle unless they stop cutting corners to make an extra few percent."}
{"text":"3.5/5

This place is what it is. Quick, make your own, individual pizza. Generally thin-crust and fairly crispy crust (if that's your thing). My date mentioned he wished it was more chewy, but to each their own.

Deducted 1.5 stars because I got it as take-out, and the crust definitely did not hold up as well as I wanted to when I got home. Pretty limp and soggy, but still edible.

For a BOGO deal that's going on til beginning of Feb, $12 for two make your own pizza, it ain't a bad deal."}
{"text":"I love this place. I don't know where I've been for the last two years but I just discovered it recently. It's the subway of pizza places. I LOVE the white sauce on the pizza, with ricotta and mozzarella, spinach OMG get the roasted garlic, they aren't too garlicy they are like caramelized garlics, you can just pick them off and eat them lol  .. add some black olives ;) Yum! They have so many cheeses, meats, veggies, fruits, and things you can choose to have on your pizza, it's great. You gotta try this place."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's like the Subway of pizza. You enter and they get your name and write it on a napkin, then you either order a traditional pizza or you create your own. I created my own :) they put a pizza crust down and you tell them what you want and YES they know what WHITE PIZZA is!! So many places I go to, don't. On a white pizza there's no red sauce it's an Alfredo sauce, it's just a good change. So they have an array of items you can choose to have on your pizza - they slide it down the table like at a sandwich shop. You can add just about anything you want, they literally have all kinds of toppings. I chose 1/2 red and 1/2 white sauce - a friend was with me and we were splitting it. Then we added roasted garlic, spinach, black olives and ricotta cheese omg! The maker hands it off to the cooker who throws it into the brick oven and within a few minutes they're yelling your name! All the crusts were the same, a nice thin, crispy crust. The pizza was great and they have beer, wine and an array of soft drinks and water."}
{"text":"They absolutely have the perfect pizza made to order on the spot. The pizzas are perfect size crust, perfect size personal portions and I have absolutely nothing but raves about this place I am a new fan. They also have online ordering which makes it really easy to pain advance and get that pizza in the oven as soon as you arrive, you should try it."}
{"text":"Unlimited toppings! And my personal favorite: one half can be left meatless for me and the other half can be loaded with meat for my carnivore boyfriend! Sometimes I feel bad when I share food with my other half and we're forced to order something meatless because I'm pescetarian, but that's not a problem at Blaze. Also, what can be wrong about a filling meal for two that only costs $10.45?"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the pizza here!  Apparently it's the same for lots of people in Charlotte!  It's always busy but the staff makes the line move super quick!  Although the original dough is amazing, I decided to try the gluten free for the first time...and let me tell you...Wow!  Doesn't taste like I'm missing out on anything!  I also love the variety of sauce options and the fact that they even have Daiya vegan cheese!  Everything is so fresh here and you can really tell that they use quality ingredients!  I also love that the manager is always on the floor.  (I think his name is Lontz?) He has been able to recommend some of my favorite pizzas & I never leave feeling like my business isn't appreciated!  This place is going to do well in the Queen City!"}
{"text":"The name is spot on; their pizzas are made fast indeed!

Hubby didn't want to park and it was the middle of the lunch rush so we didn't want to dine in, but there's no place to drop off passengers nearby. It so happened that when we stopped because the light was red, I was close to the entrance, so I hopped out.

The dining room was full but there was no line up. I told the staff taking the order that it was my first time and he explained the whole process. After you give your order you move down the line to the person who assembles your pizza. You can add on as many fresh and savoury toppings as you want, so definitely take advantage of this to get the most bang for your buck. If you don't think you can pick up the pizza slice because of the amount of toppings on it, then I would suggest eating it with a knife and fork. They kinda rush you along with your choices if they're busy but staff is friendly nevertheless. After you design your pizza you move onto the cashier to order your drinks and dessert, definitely get their sea salt (chocolate chunk) cookie and ask them to warm it up. 

Your experience will only get better as you get more comfortable with the system and the width and breadth of the many choices you have for variety. If you're overwhelmed with creating your own pizza, or you're not good at matching flavors, they have signature pizzas you can choose from.

Favorites: spicy red pizza sauce, garlic pesto sauce, applewood bacon, Italian sausage, cherry tomatoes (marinated), mushrooms, red onions, roasted (whole) garlic, sautéed onion, spinach, ovalini mozzarella, sea salt (chocolate chunk) cookie.

Coming back to try: \"high rise crust\", white cream sauce, balsamic glaze and their smores warmed up.

PS: By the time hubby drove around the block, I was already waiting out front with our scrumptious, hot, affordable pizza!"}
{"text":"Very slow service! It appears to be no order and poor leadership that causes long lines and poor production. There are a lot of young kids working there which is a good thing however many of them don't have good work ethics and or professionalism and that is causing poor customer service. They need a good manager to fix this location because it is the absolute worst BLAZE location that I've ever been to. They car NOTHING about the food they serve and that's evident with this pizza I received today. It tasted just as horrible as it looks. I would've asked for it to be made over but after looking at everyone else's pizza there was no hope for a better outcome. This was a HORRIBLE dining experience."}
{"text":"The food was great! The pizza was crispy and the topping selections are varied and fresh. The service was good and friendly.  The time between ordering and receiving your pizza was not long and we had big orders .  Love that they had turkey meats for those that don't eat pork or beef.  Pizza also heats up well too"}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and I'm still in awe by how much the pizza is done by 3 minutes and especially with the fresh ingredients! I've tried the meat eater, bbq chkn and white top. I love the meat eater and white top. For the bbq chkn uhhh I didn't like the sauce that came with it. Best part is the unlimited toppings you can add! The only drink I can suggest is the pink lemonade one. The matcha and the hibiscus didn't taste so good. Must try in chambana!:)"}
{"text":"I had come to like this place however last night after the NFL playoffs I decided to go and get me a pizza. Meat Eater with mushrooms. The guy says \"we're out of mushrooms\". Yes. That's my reason for my two star rating. When this happens at a fast growing corporate establishment it usually spells the beginning of the end. Imagine a car factory running out of air bags but deciding to produce cars with no airbags due to their Mismanagement. They need to put policy in place where somebody (usually a manager or something) orders more mushrooms when more mushrooms are needed.  I actually looked it up on the Internet and there is no shortage of mushrooms. I wouldn't be surprised if one day I went in there and they were out of cheese or dough. Smh."}
{"text":"Love love this place! It's right by the new LVAC gym on Decatur and I've always been Fascinated to try but hesitant due to my \"healthy\" lifestyle. But this place is pretty legit. You can even have yourself a gluten free pizza! not that I went that route but if one wanted to you can.

I was pretty surprised that you can have unlimited toppings for only about $8. It's a self pizza but me and the beau shared one and I left satisfied. The toppings seemed fresh. They make the pizza and than it takes about 8-10 minutes and it's done. Fresh and bomb!

We topped our pizzas half and half. I was able to put my own toppings on one half of the pizza while the beau did his thing on the other half. And it's thin crust.. My favorite. You can also get a \"rising crust\" if you wanted to.

Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Tryd the bbq chicken Pizza very delicious. People here seem nice and very friendly great place to try if new. ohhh and p.s. try the cookie its out if this world."}
{"text":"This is like the Chipotle of pizza. I love the idea of fast pizza! You can choose one of their recipes, or you can make your own with as many toppings as you like for a really good price! They have a gluten-free option as well for about $3 extra. I've been waiting for a place like this. I had a vegan pizza with everything I could think of and it was great! I've been here a few times now and will certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"This is an entirely new concept in pizza restaurants that will upset the industry in several ways.

When you walk in, you'll see an ingredients \"buffet\" similar to what some sandwich shops do.  Walk up and start your order by telling them what type of crust you want (regular unprocessed wheat or gluten-free).  I got the standard, and it tastes great.  Then you choose your sauce.  I can't remember all the options, there are many.  I went with the spicy red sauce, which isn't really all that spicy, just more flavorful than a standard sauce.  They caution you to not pair this with the more delicate ingredients like buffalo mozzarella or you may mask their flavors.  Now onward with your cheese selection(s), there are a few.  

At this point you'll be handed off to the next person for your meat selections, if any.  You'll find the standard fare, plus a few things like real smoked bacon (most so-called smoked bacon is just flavored that way), and turkey-mushroom meatballs.  From there you move to veggie selection, and again, they have the usual plus some nice extras.  Roasted garlic cloves, roasted bell peppers, and more.  At the end you can choose some optional extras like an oil drizzle, oregano, etc.  Then they take it away to bake it.

I was shocked at how fast it was done.  Since the crust is nice and thin, I guess they can cook it more quickly?  Everything tasted great.

The ingredients have a focus on quality and healthiness.  They are sourcing hormone-free organic ingredients.  The crust is simple, with little processing and no junk.  There are no fillers in anything, and the sodium content is much lower than in most other pizzas.  Their nutritional info is on their web site, and I was shocked to see how low most of their pizzas were in calories and sodium.

On top of the awesome pizza, the salads are great."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is the Joint....you can get all the toppings you want no limit love love love!!! You can choose from the thin which is original or high rise which is the thicker one both are good....I like the thin the best but I don't like a lot of bread."}
{"text":"Totally no expectations going in, so I'm glad I was pretty satisfied with the end product. 

I was downtown for a show, just around the corner from Blaze.  It was close to 11pm and I was HANGRY.  The place I was at had like minus 5 food options and they weren't even good options.  I wanted something quick and cheap or I was going to go off on someone.  In comes Blaze.

I walked in 20 minutes to closing and the place was still bumpin and kitchen in full force.  I was going to get the unlimited toppings option, but I didn't wanna get crazy wid it, so I opted for the two-topping pizza.  I went with the classic sauce and cheese with pepperoni and mushrooms.  The guy making my pizza was beyond nice and kept asking and making sure if each topping was enough for me.  So nice!  Some people are too shy to ask for more or less, so this was a nice touch.  I told him to go HAM with the cheese and to load that mother with mushrooms.

I would say it took less than 10 minutes for the pizza to cook.  I asked for some pesto drizzle at the end to green it up a little.  The pizza is a good size with very thin crust.  Even small eaters (who are starving) could probably eat the whole pizza to themselves.  You'd probably feel a little sick after, but no one told you to do that *shrug.  I particularly was satisfied with two slices.  I could have eaten another but it was late and I thought maybe not.  A heavy eater would defs be satisfied with the size of the pizza.  Heck, they may even be able to eat two if they're starving!  

I do like how the pizza crust is super thin.  Cheese, pepperoni and mushrooms were on point. Really no complaints here.

Also, at that price point ($12 something with tax), you cannot complain.  Good size pizza, fresh, made to order, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"A make your own place. You tell them they make it and bake it. Like a Subway for pizza.  This one had reasonable sized salads too. Premade but not already in the plastic containers. 
Friendly staff. Packed at 7:45. Families and teens. No loud music but family kind of loud. 

If you don't like what's on your pizza it's your own darn fault."}
{"text":"Just ordered to pizzas and my husbands came back perfectly cooked except did not have BBQ sauce on it like he asked for and my pizza came back burnt. How does that happen."}
{"text":"Man, Henderson-nites (is that the proper term?) really love this place! I've heard so many good things about Blaze pizza and have been encouraged to make it out here. This place was packed in a way I haven't seen any other custom-built pizza place packed, so I knew I was in for something good. For such a busy place, they're really efficient with their assembly line system. I opted for the white cream pizza (bacon, garlic, white cream sauce, oregano, and arugula topped at the end) and added roasted garlic (love the huge whole pieces!), pepperoni, and mushrooms. Made the long drive back to the westside before I had a bite, but once I did, I really enjoyed it. This place is still too far out for me to be a regular, so I will stick to my local The Pizza Kitchen, but next time I'm on this side of town, I'd for sure come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I just tried Blaze for the first time. It was recommended highly from my brother in law. We were greeted upon entry from Davey who was a sweetheart. He asked us if we had ever been in before and asked if we'd like to hear the process. We declined because we knew how everything worked from your competitors (i.e. Pieology). We told him we wanted a 1 topping pizza and a build your own; therefore, purchasing 2 pizzas. 

The girl who \"put\" my pizza together (which was a 1 topping - BBQ sauce, mozzarella and grilled chicken). I simply asked her if I could add another small amount of a different cheese (being feta) she rudely snapped back at me saying NO, parmesan cheese is the only free one, other wise we will have to charge you more and it'll become a build you're own pizza. No compassion at all so I just looked at her and said never mind, basically freggin sorry I asked a simple question to disrupt your night. I did not get her name, however if the general manager is reading this and needs to narrow it down, she was a shorter Hispanic female working the night of March 8th, the time was around 8:30pm. Another employee made my wife's pizza, who did a fantastic job on hers and was happy to answer any questions my wife had with a smile. She seemed to be the manager on duty. 

After my wife paid for the pizzas she noticed we were over charged. We were charged for 2 build your own pizzas, therefore, my wife let the employee know who had rung us up about the mistake. The employee who made my wife's pizza (also assumed to be the MOD) rung her up. Once again, we didn't get her name either. Once she heard about the mistake her demeanor changed completely and we once again became an inconvenience to them. My wife said she somehow reversed the mistake and wanted to re-run my wife's debit card, but the balance wouldn't be returned to her card for 1-3 business days. Therefore, she would of ran my wife's card for close to $30 on a $18 bill. We weren't planning on spending much money so we left cash at home due to my wife making most of her money in cash tips from where she is employed, and even carrying around $100 bill these days could be dangerous, which is the only dollar amount we had at home, no smaller bills, therefore we only leave a small amount of money in our account (this all may be TMI, but I'm getting somewhere) after my wife said re asked the question about it taking probably 3 days for the mistake to be added back to her card, my wife stopped her at that point and said never mind, we will just eat the $2 mistake on your part. This seemed to upset the employee even more and just said forget it, here is what I reversed and I won't charge you again in a snotty tone. 

My wife walked away to grab our pizzas that were just being finished from Cristian, who was a sweetheart and very helpful! 

Once we sat down, our pizzas were already cold! Along with my pizza being cold, it had absolutely NO TASTE. Remember, I had a BBQ chicken pizza, which should have a TON of taste. I now understand why they ask you if you want any salt on your pizza because you need it have any taste on your pizza. 

Needless to say, we will never be back to BLAZE. It was a waste of time and money. 

Hopefully others have a better experience than me and my wife did tonight. 

Thank you to Davey & Christian for being sweet & helpful, much more than I can say about the other 2 female employees."}
{"text":"I downloaded yelp just so I can leave a review!!! And to be real, I never leave yelp reviews. I was completely awed at the customer service I received tonight by Elliot and his closing staff. I really enjoyed the staffs humble vibe and they took care of me when I told them I've never been here. Elliot explained to me the menu and everyone else was working hard as they were closing up soon. I work at Zappos so customer service is my thing. It was great to see that coming in yes I am a customer, but they also treated me as a peer so ordering pizza was simple and fun. You guys have a cool staff and they deserve a raise. Because of the great customer service I am a customer forever. Thank you."}
{"text":"The customer service was awful, the whole crew was absolutely rude and insanely slow. I'll go get pizza somewhere where my business is appreciated."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend love this place because we both have different taste in pizza and she can get it with less cheese. Love the friendly staff and how fast the food is made."}
{"text":"This pizza is  Great,  you just have to keep an eye on the employees! The time that I've been  bossy about the way it's  made its been excellent. The one time I did an online order it was so so.."}
{"text":"Low priced, make your own pizza with high-quality ingredients. Only downside is, it is so good and such a good deal that the place often has lines leading to the front door."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza joint! Raye, Emma, and X were super helpful and friendly. They make the best pizzas ever. I can't wait to bring all my friends and family to Blaze!"}
{"text":"This is high quality fast food pizza, but I'm judging it against all pizza.  Were I comparing it to pie five, uncle maddios, or one of the other build your own pizza chains, it would rate above those others.
They have a pretty good crust that does have decent flavor, but they lose me with the pam spray coated dough press.  I hate the uniform fast food look of every crust and I don't like the use of the aerosol cooking spray with my crust.  Toppings seem to be high quality for the price point.  A 7$ pizza will always be a 7$ pizza.  You simply can't provide the best ingredients without charging more.  That said, the toppings are high quality for the segment.
If you're searching for exceptional pizza I would tell you to go elsewhere.  If you're looking for a nice thin crust to load on some proteins, veggies, or whatever your preference, this is a great spot.
Not a culinary destination, but a cool place to grab a bite and have the flexibility to get creative without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Great lunch with nice price... Picking all the great toppings for your own personal pizza for one great price added bonus is the quick service."}
{"text":"Crappy pizza. Really boring.the whole menu is lousy.  Not worth your time of energy unless you have a free pizza coupon (which I did), but honestly, if they sent me another one, I  would not even go for free."}
{"text":"I love Blaze, but tonight I was so disappointed. The girl behind the counter treated us like an inconvenience. The pizzas came out soggy. One was so bad we had to ask for it to go back in. When it came out, it wasn't good enough to eat and had to be totally remade. I also had a pizza that was a to go order. When I went inside to pick it up, the girl threw the box with the pizza in it on top of the counter. It was obvious that she was annoyed. It was a rough night. I hope that it gets better as Blaze is one of my favorite places to eat. I'm attaching a picture of the first mushy mess. It was awful."}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday night. It was too packed. The line moves quite quickly and there is plenty of seating within the restaurant. I redeemed a BOGO coupon and got a free drink along with another pizza. $13ish for your own personal pizza would seem a bit expense but the fact that you can put any toppings on t definitely makes it worth it. No longer are you restrained by these cookie cutter pizzas or make your own pizza with limited toppings. There were multiple toppings of tomato sauce, various cheeses (I appreciate this) and lots of meat options. Usually at these places, I go overboard on the meat toppings and it tastes overly salty, but this was pretty good. I liked the thin crust. The pizza wasn't so soggy such that it ruined the experience. It was also made quickly. In the mood for alcohol, there's beers (Steamwhistle and Mill Street and along with some wine - Chardonnay I believe). All in all, a cheap night out!   

Use code workworkwork to get the BOGO coupon when you download the app. Expires in Feb 2018 but not sure when they'll pull the plug on the code."}
{"text":"We are super impressed. We love this format we first encountered in other big cities--so cool to have one here.

Some places try to hide their weaknesses in a more-toppings-are-better philosophy. We like Blaze because they know how to balance the flavors and won't just cram it on (unless you ask, presumably)."}
{"text":"The best part of my experience... My name is Celia Huey and they put my name down as Ophilia Hewey anyways, soooooo delicious"}
{"text":"Great Pizza!!!  If you want some great Fire Brick Pizza in Central Phoenix this is the place to go.  If I were you I would pick up the Pizza and take it home.  There is nothing special about eating the Pizza at the restaurant.  It reminds me of going to Subway because you get to build your own Pie, but like Subway why would you want to eat you Sub there.  They do serve beer, but there was nothing on draft I desired.  Overall if you want some take out Pizza this is a great place go."}
{"text":"You can customize everything and add as much toppings as you'd like. Loved the meat eater- load it up when you order! I also tried the bbq chicken, wasn't a big fan of it. Overall would come back again for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Before I tried it I was nervous as I'm a cheese lover and I didn't understand how they could have unlimited toppings and still provide adequate cheese coverage at the prices they have on the menu. Turns out it wasn't really a problem at all. The crust is quite thin so it doesn't need an inch layer of cheese, and you can add multiple cheeses to create optimum coverage. I love that they let me get half red sauce and half white cream sauce. They look at me like they hate me, but they oblige every time. All of the toppings have been excellent quality. The only ones I don't really care for are the chicken which I think could be better quality and the turkey meatballs which are a little fluffy and spongy in texture. I'm pretty fussy about how I like my pizza so for the big chains I always order with the website or app for ultimate customization control. I love that  this place allows me to do that face-to-face without hassle or confusion. I'm hooked."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, well prepared,  well cooked and fast!    Eat in, pick up, your choice, but either way, your pizza has a three choice sauce option, fresh ingredients and it is fire grilled.   The staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean and well organized.   There are a lot of vegetarian options and vegan options as well.   The build your own pizza option is one I'll try next time I'm there.   

For those with your eye on your waistline, they even have the calories on their standard pizzas as well as the ingredients listed.  

Is this my new go-to pizza place?  Yup.   Under $11 for a 10 inch thin crust pizza and yes,  they have some pretty neat ingredients, like gorgonzola cheese and banana peppers as well as a couple of choices of mozzarella as well.  And they will add 'more' to your build your own pizza if you ask.

But best of all for me was the service, fast friendly and smiling, and asking how everything was ... not once but twice!

Oh yeah,  and they have pink lemonade as  a fountain drink choice!"}
{"text":"Had been anticipating their opening. Happened to stop by on opening day. Very pleased and looking forward to returning. Quality ingredients and friendly service - far better than my experience at Pieology in Summerlin a few months ago."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent visitor to the Bloomington location for over a year so I was very excited when this location was being built! Blaze is always spot on, I've never had a bad pizza from a location. Tried out the new spot in champaign in it's first week of being opened so I expected things to run a little rough but I was completely wrong. Congrats champaign location, everything was made correctly and quickly like normal and the staff seemed friendly enough without being over the top. Glad you're in town!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The staff was amazing. Cheery, happy, funny. Great environment. Pizza...delish. Fresh, good topping selections too! And the 'MADE FRESH DAILY' LEMONADE...amazing. I had the blood orange- strawberry. Not too sweet or tart! Only negative thing was it was hard to read the menu from the side where the line starts. Big enough...just awkward. And where we sat down, people kept standing so so close to our table leaning over to read the menu too. Overall, I'll definitely be back. Great job!"}
{"text":"Second time coming to this place and I am still sold!! I love the idea that you can build your own personal size pizza for a flat rate. There are so many options to choose from for your toppings, such as classic red sauce, to pesto and a smorgasbord of veggies and meats. Since this is a fire oven your personal creation is done fairly quickly."}
{"text":"We love this place! 
It's a flat fee for a personalized pizza. The crust is delicious and the service is FAST!"}
{"text":"Eddie was really friendly! Made sure the customers were satisfied and stayed on top of things! Great pizza  and I love the outdoor seating"}
{"text":"This place is a great option for a quick reasonably priced lunch or dinner.  It was a little confusing for me as a first time customer, but the staff quickly realized and helped me out.  I was able to get whatever I wanted on my pizza and it only took a few minutes to cook!  Everything seemed really fresh.  The blood orange lemonade was really good too."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I had Settebello a few days before Blaze. Maybe it's because I got the Blaze pizza to-go. Maybe I shouldn't have gotten the pesto drizzle on a to-go pizza.

However, I wasn't too impressed by Blaze's Pizza. It was greasy, the crust was thin, and there was just nothing exciting about it. This is only in regards to their gluten free pizza. On the other hand, my parents enjoyed their Red Vine pizza just fine. Not as good as Settebello, but they enjoyed it.

The salad was fine, but again, nothing to write home to Mom about.

It was definitely edible, but with so many choices around here, I wouldn't run to get to this place. We've decided to give it another try and go there instead to eat.

The price? Very good. Inexpensive even. $10 for a pizza. Maybe it's not quite fair to compare it to Settebello which is $20/pizza?

Their website was down and when I called they wouldn't take the order over the phone which is a little bit of a hassle. 

My dad said the people he dealt with when there were helpful though, so that's definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"This was a really delicious pizza, fast paced, a little loud, but superbly organized place.

Going in for the first time and not knowing what my options were, the staff person was super friendly and had me select what base pizza and toppings I would have. They did speak really fast though, and so for a loud place like this, realistically, I saw their mouth movie and heard sounds but couldn't exactly make out what they were saying.

Well anyways, this pizza store is an order and sit down kind of restaurant. It reminds me of an upgraded subway type order with a pizz upa upgraded twist to it. You can order a half or a full pizza slice, with your choice of sauce (tomato, pesto, etc.) and the cheese slash toppings you want. If you don't want cheese on your pizza, not a problem, blaze pizza will alter that option for you.

The pizzas cost a little more than $10 for a size of about a small or medium if you order from a place like pizza pizza or one of the chain restaurants, but its definitely worth it. There's gluten free options, salad choices and yes, it's fired up for you! 

They also have additional boxes on the side if you can't finish your pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizzas are good and you can build your own, agua frescas are awesome, and you can't beat $5 for any pizza on Mondays. I work nearby so every Monday is a #pizzaday!"}
{"text":"They are the best and they don't roll their eyes at me like the pizza place across the street. 

They're clean, respectful and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Great choice for a quick pizza. Friendly and helpful staff Ask for \"Ash\" the friendly high school student that rides a bus two hours each way to get to and from work. One size pizza about medium... no pizza is over $7.65. You can build your own or select from one of the many choices they offer. The crust is thin and not overly cooked. You can select from several choices of sauces white or red. The toppings are all fresh that you can select from. The restaurant is tastefully decorated, clean and has indoor & outdoor seating. They offer bottled beer and wine."}
{"text":"Yes please, as far as fast pizza like dominos, little ceasars, papa johns, Blaze is light years ahead with taste and quality ingredients. It's my kids go to pizza and I'm not mad about it. A Blaze night is always a great night"}
{"text":"Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. This place is where it's at. 
Disclosure: I'm normally NOT a pizza person. It's typically just not my thing. But after a long day of running errands and a trip to the mall, my husband and I were itching to try something new for dinner. Blaze is in the old Schlotzsky's building in the Galleria Mall parking lot (and can we have a moment of silence for Schlotsky's cause damn those sandwiches were good! ). 
Blaze is like Subway for the pizza connoisseur in you. While they have about 7 or 8 specialty pizzas to offer, the real fun is in creating your own. They have a smorgasbord selection of sauces, meats and toppings to choose from. Best part? No charge for each topping like literally every other nickel and dime you pizza joint. It's all one price. You can get more than one type of sauce, more than one type of cheese and all the toppings your hungry little heart desires. 
Once you've created your masterpiece, it goes in a wood fired oven and if you're not familiar with those, let's just say that they cook a pizza to absolute perfection in approximately the same amount of time it takes you to fill your drink cup and find a seat. It's fast-like lightning fast. So once your pizza is done, they call out your name and you pick it up and you devour it. Savor it. Fall in mad, crazy love with it. And if you're a piggy like my husband, you may even go back for another one. 
Suggestion: Your drink choice should be the root beer. It's so good. Like I'm considering going there today just for the root beer good. I can't explain it (and I'm rarely, if ever, at a loss for words) but do yourself a solid and go get a pizza and root beer. You can thank me later. 
The prices are very reasonable; we paid around $25 for 3 pizzas and 2 sodas. If you have room, consider splurging for the smores bar and ask them to warm it up. Your sweet tooth will be beyond satisfied. 
The employees were all very helpful and friendly, the restaurant itself was clean and there's plenty of seating both inside and out (although who would want to sit outside in this blasted heat is beyond me). 
They have an app for your phone where you can collect flames for every transaction you make. Once you get 10 flames, you get a free pizza. I adore restaurant apps where you can earn rewards after so many purchases. Here's my issue with this one: you get a flame for every transaction, not every pizza. So if I bring 6 people in and we all get a pizza, that's only 1 flame. Lame. I suppose you could beat the system by paying for each pizza you buy separately but that's a pain. Blaze should really rethink their reward system. 
All in all, this is an awesome concept for a pizza joint and more importantly, the food itself is delicious and the service is top notch. Build your own pizza. Who'd a thunk it?  It's genius!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for the first time and loved it!
The pizza was delicioussssss. It honestly tasted better than most downtown restaurants that specializes in pizza. I love the customization aspect, the unlimited topping selections and the sauces. They even have a selection of dipping sauces you can pick from at the very end, for free!

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and I love love love the thin crust!!! I like it to build my own because I don't like sauce on my pizza. It's fast and convenient. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS 
I love the style of this pizza place as you can build it yourself 
I got the green dragon here and it had pesto juicy tomatoes, yummy chicken stretchy cheese and you have options to put your own personalized toppings
this place reminds me of chipotle and the pizza is a reasonable price for the amazing taste 
there are so many different options to build your pizza so everyone can find something they like ! 
the service here is excellent and the people were quickly and are nice 
the seating is limited so most likely you will need to do take out 
would come again I just love the pizza and one of the best I've had !!"}
{"text":"Yay for consistency! 

It works for sandwiches, burritos, tacos, and now pizza. Blaze is another fast food chain going with the, \"build it yourself\" model. I've been to few a locations in So-Cal; L.A., San Diego, and now Henderson, like I stated before \"yay for consistency\". 

The Food. The toppings are fresh and the service is speedy. When you order your pizza can either choose one of the premade pies, which there are nine of, or build your own pizza. Which is what I did; sausage, black olives, basil, spicy marinara sauce, and shredded mozzarella. It was delicious! You have multiple sauce and cheese options, but only type of crust, thin. Remember this place is built for speed not to share an authentic NYC or Chicago style of pizza. 

After your pie cooks in a crazy hot oven, your name is called and your pizza is ready, about five minutes total cooking time. Blaze offers salad options for the non-pizza lover, which by the way sounds crazy, I mean who doesn't like pizza?! Thirsty? - Beer or wine can also be purchased if you're not in the mood for soda or water. I went with my favorite, Ballast Point - Sculpin. 

Total bill for the meal; one pizza, one salad, two beers and two bottles of water... twenty-eights dollars. Blaze Pizza is keepin' it real, real affordable."}
{"text":"I'm impressed. Build your own pizza for $7.65! Crust is thin, crunchy and tasty. You can even do the Brooklyn fold! Ready in minutes and finished off with fresh arugula, olive oil or pesto if you desire. Friendly staff. Come and support the new local pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Love the fact that I can build my own pizza for a reasonable price and get fairly pleasant service"}
{"text":"Still a huge fan of this quick-fire concept restaurant and the AYCE toppings and sauces that you can handle on the dough.

They have such a wide variety of choices that you can get a different pizza every time and not exhaust the options.

The service is fast and friendly and the pizzas just pop out of that oven.  Make sure to get the arugula at the very end to add that extra bit of green at the end.

The only thing to remember is that the pizza stays crisp for about 30min.  After that, the sauce (or extreme weight of your toppings) will make the crust soggy and unappealing.

I guess fast-fire'd isn't just meant to describe the cooking time but the pizza-into-your-mouth time as well.  :-P

Can never go wrong if you want a quick bite before some evening activity.  In this case, we were going to the Raptors game right after so it was a perfect fit."}
{"text":"What a great place on the corner of Camden Rd. They describe it like the Subway for pizza. You can add as many toppings as you like for just $8. One pie is perfectly sized for an individual. Beautiful outside seating!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great but the customer service is terrible. I came in around 4pm and the girl who took my order was hunched over the counter, didn't greet me, barely looked up at me, and seemed generally annoyed. The next girl in the line who put the toppings on my pizza was helpful and made a comment to that girl about needing to smile. After I checked out, a different girl cut my pizza. When I asked to add drizzle, she rolled her eyes at me, added the drizzle, and then shoved my pizza into a box without saying a word. I could hear an employee ask what everyone's problem was to which another employee said \"don't nobody want to be here\". Well, that was pretty evident. The whole ordering experience was awkward and incredibly off putting. I'll buy an $8 pizza somewhere else where I won't have to inconvenience workers who clearly don't want to be there. I understand that this location employees a lot of college students due to its location but there must be better motivated and polite students to hire."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW: I came back after a few months because I was looking for a large, but quick meal. I came just after 2pm and it was packed! I was lucky to grab 2 seats wedged between 2 parties. There were people next to me who weren't eating or drinking anything but just doing work (there isn't even free wifi so???). There was about 6 employees at the time but they weren't stationed efficiently. It took a while for someone to add my toppings because the assigned employee was adding toppings for someone ahead of me in the line. It took even longer for someone to cash me out.

It was also concerning that when I asked for extra of one topping, they would give me less, and when I asked for a little of another topping, they piled it on. They also raised the price of the customizable pizza by a dollar. The pizza is still quite delicious so that's why I'm still giving this place 4 stars, but I worry that it's starting to go downhill."}
{"text":"We love Blaze and come here often but the service is always so slow, there are not enough workers, and it seems like no one knows what they are doing. The \"shift lead\" lady literally was doing nothing and then the line was out the door and she grabbed a drink and went in the back. All of the tables were covered in trash like no one had cleaned all night. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! The personal pizzas are just the right size and I can put whatever I want on my pizza and not have to worry about my fiancé not liking it because he can make his own!"}
{"text":"Not getting into details, but had an awful customer service experience. There are much better pizza spots in town."}
{"text":"Blaze is one of my favorite restaurants. My girlfriend and I eat here about three times a month. She's picky so it's great because she can get what works for her and I can make a huge meat lovers pizza that she would hate. It's the best of both worlds."}
{"text":"I'm a forever pizza lover. And after eating at BFF- I am hooked. The build your own concept is not a new one: Subway and Chipotle had the market for awhile but watch out, there is a new kid in town. 
One tip- know your order before you get up the the counter. People are anxiously waiting in line and when you can't decide and take too long, it makes others (myself included) get a little hangry. 
The first time ordering can be a bit intimidating, but you will quickly get the hang of it. They will walk you through the process.
I love how quickly the pizza comes out and how crunchy, crisp, and thin the crust is. I call it a pizza cracker. There is a build your own option or a few a popular pizza combos. 
We ordered 2 BYO and one drink and it was under 20$. I took a few slices home to eat for dinner. I left feeling satisfied but not overstuffed and greasy which is a good thing. 
I liked that there was an employee working the dining room. She cleared tables, wiped them down, and asked how we enjoyed our meal and if we needed anything. A nice extra touch.
 I would warn this place is LOUD so don't come here for an intimate date. There are tables outside but eating near all the cars in the parking lot is really not my idea of enjoyable. 
Yay to a great pizza option in LV.
* I would like to see all employees wearing hair nets under their hats. Also the hair needs to be pulled back under the hat- so many ladies had pieces of hair dangling out from underneath- too close to the pizzas and ingredients. :/"}
{"text":"First went here when my mom and I were at Universal Studios back in the spring on a friend's recommendation. I was really excited to know we have them in Vegas now too. Tasty, fresh ingredients, solid customer service and the blood orange lemonade is delicious, refreshing, and unique. I like the art lover's pizza, but you can't go wrong with a 1-top with traditional sauce either."}
{"text":"This is the Chipotle of pizza. Been here 6 times every time they are consistent.  The toppings are fresh and choices are many. Only problem is the crust. Nothing special and a little bland. It's cheap and fills a void that's  out there. Always crowded but clears out fast. If they worked on the crust and had single bar seating like Chipotle i would eat there more often."}
{"text":"I think about this place everytime I go downtown. Even if I am not hungry. Even if I just had pizza. The pizza here is amazing. 

They are pretty quick, considering they are making you a pizza, fresh, in front of you. I would definitely recommend building your own - they have a tonne of options. Also the pricing for their pizzas is very competitive/similar to the generic Pizza Pizza around every corner. Except the pizza is 1000 times better! 

The people working here know what they are doing - I usually see the same guy working the oven, but he steps over if there's any issues with working the pizza assembly area. The people here try to get things moving as quickly as possible and it's great to see. 

I will continue coming to Blaze - their pizza is so damn addicting. Quality pizza and ingredients for a really good price."}
{"text":"The service is great and the workers are incredibly friendly. It's got a cool environment on the inside and a great looking outdoor patio for when the weather is warmer. My pizza could have been cooked a little more. Toppings were still a bit cold and cheese should have been more melted. I would ask them to have your pizza well done. There is one single biggest reason as to why I won't return - the music is way too loud. I literally could not hear my husband and my five-year-old in a conversation. There were only two other parties in there while we were there. I asked a worker if he was able to turn down the music or if it was a directive from corporate (chipotle does the same thing). He was incredibly friendly and stated that corporate sets the volume but he could ask his manager. I told him not to worry about it. But I will not return because it's uncomfortably loud in there and I am an avid concert goer so I'm used to loud! It was also extremely cold in there."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love pizza especially when you can make it just the way you like. Without extra costs of ingredients, you can have as many toppings available as you want. It is quick easy and delish...puts a smile on my daughter's faces every time we visit! The fact that we don't have to go to 4 different restaurants to satisfy my family of 4 is a huge plus! We all can get exactly what we want made to perfection. The dining area is always clean and has plenty of room to feel comfy without clutter. If you're cutting back on breads try a salad with the toppings of your choice...its great...We just love this place!"}
{"text":"No a fan of their gluten free crust. Only way it is edible is if you drown it in basalmic drizzle. I definitely prefer Mod Pizza's gluten free crust over theirs. Don't see myself going back here unless it's for a salad."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I literally come here at least  2 times a week (yes I know that's a lot of carbs). This is by far our FAVORITE pizza place in all of the land. The service is amazing, shout out to my girl Tori making my straight FIRE pizza. The quality of the food is so yummy and you seriously can't beat the price. We will be loyal customers forever!"}
{"text":"Go to pizza place, right next to UNCC, the boardwalk and other stores. Great prices, under 10$ always, and good service. The pizza is made in a brick oven and you can watch them do it, so you aren't just sitting there bored. Reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because fired pizza isn't my favorite because on the bottom of the pizzas there's ashes lol. Other than that this is my favorite pizza place to go to!!"}
{"text":"Today is Pi day and blaze pizza is the only build your own pizza place out of pieology and pizza rev that had a good promo, $3.14 for a pizza limit one per customer. 

I arrived at 2:25 and the line was out the door. It took me about an hour to place my order and pay. Lines were out the door the entire morning but workers were still friendly despite the chaos and some grouchy customers. I overheard a worker saying they're estimated to sell about 2500 pizzas... That's insane! Of course the pizza assembly line was also crazy, toppings were being thrown onto the pizzas and some spilled on the counters and floors but the workers did a great job. 

If you haven't been to blaze before, I believe the pizzas are $7.95. They have a few pizzas that you can choose from or you can build your own. They have gluten free pizzas as well as salads and dessert. You can add whatever you want... Meat toppings include salami, meatball, Italian sausage, pepperoni and chicken. Cheeses include mozzarella, Goat cheese, Gorgonzola, Parmesan, feta, ricotta. Veggies: artichoke hearts, mushroom, onion, bell peppers, olives, spinach, fresh basil, oregano, garlic, tomatoes... And more. They also have toppings that are put on at the very end, which include pesto sauce, bbq sauce, arugula (my favorite!!) and ranch (on the side). 

Lines here move fast... If customers know what they want! It only takes about 5 minutes for pizzas to finish cooking once in the oven. Pizzas are a good size, they're thin crust though. I finished half for lunch and saved half for dinner."}
{"text":"Vegan cheese!!! Tasty pizza and a pretty good price. I wish they had breadsticks, but that is just me. The line is usually long but moves fast."}
{"text":"The service here is always great!  Food is good & made exactly as you request.  The \"crew\" is always checking on you and keeps the dining area very clean"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy splitting a bbq chicken and each getting our own little salad. Came in to find they no longer have pre packed salad. They now have them on large plates with dressing already applied. My wife and I both commented to each other how soggy our lettuce was. If you like your salad with crisp lettuce you better pass on their new way of serving their salads."}
{"text":"Chipotle-like assembly line pizza. Pretty good, great prices. The bbq chicken was tasty but could have used more bbq sauce. Crust is very thin and crispy so if you like that style definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza! Amazing service! Amazing price! Went for the first time today and can't wait to go back again and again. Best part is the unlimited toppings! And...they have halal toppings!!!"}
{"text":"Really tasty customizable pizza done fast. Think of this restaurant like a Chipotle for pizza. Everything us customizable, and service is fast. You can make your own pizza with unlimited toppings for $10.45, or choose a pre-made combination. My first time here, I built my own. The process was well thought out, and time from ordering to eating was only a few minutes. The pizza was tasty, and the crust (thin and crispy) was a treat. It might not be the best pizza ever, but you can't argue with the speed. 

This will likely be one of my go-to lunch spots, provided they can maintain the present level of service. Keeping speed and quality up will be essential to making this concept work."}
{"text":"Really love this place. The ordering process is a little overwhelming at first, but if you have ever ordered a pizza in your life you will do fine. Food is extremely good, at a great price, and the atmosphere is very fun. Really looking forward to cooler weather so I can try the patio."}
{"text":"I know this place has not been open too long, so I'm sure they still have some kinks to work out.  But, I was disappointed.  The concept is really cool since you get to build your own pizza and watch them create it before popping it in the fire oven. I was really annoyed that they didn't offer a number to sit on your table for pizza delivery if you were dining in.  I had to stand around for almost 15 minutes while our pizzas cooked and my other guests were seated at a table.  This would have greatly improved my experience.  

The pizzas we ordered were good, but burnt on the bottom.  So much so that one of them tasted like just burnt crust over the other toppings.  Wish they had more pizza suggestions on their menu.  I like that they offer links like goat cheese - but I wasn't sure what toppings would pair well with that.  

I will try this place again, but maybe take my pizza to go."}
{"text":"Ah-mazing! This tasty little spot exceeded our expectations. Truly a delicious and fun experience."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great place, good prices and excellent food.  You can choose exactly how you like your pizza.  There's a good amount of staff working.  They all seem nice but I want to give a special shout out and accolades to Ms. Debra.  You are always super pleasant to see when we come in as you are always smiling and have such a friendly demeanor.  You are always on the floor cleaning up the tables, asking people if they are done and putting everyone's condiments away.  Tonight you had come by and asked how everything was.  You heard me out and took initiative to make things better.  I really want you to know you are a great asset to Blaze and you are appreciated.   Thank you so much for making my dining experience even better this evening.   A thanks to Johnny who when there was a problem with the order he was very accommodating.  Johnny was very prompt in resolving the problem.  Thank you guys .  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to get some delicious, fresh, how you like it pizza."}
{"text":"Cool place for hot pizza, FAST!  Choose from one of their signature pies or \"build your own\" from a slew of ingredients.  Don't be afraid to pile 'em on.  It's all one price!  Trying to keep the carbs to a minimum?  No problem.  They gave healthy salads, too.  Patio seating is available for days when Mother Nature is kind.  Ice cold A/C indoors when she's not."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first taste of a Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza -- and it probably won't be my last (even though there are no Blaze Pizza joints near where I live). 

Blaze is franchise system that has developed a unique machine for forming their crust and a super hot gas oven for cranking out their pizzas. You can order one of their signature combinations or pick and choose ingredients to suit your taste. 

Even though Blaze uses modern technology and a standardized system to throw your pizza together in a matter of minutes, the finished product is actually a pretty decent pizza. In fact, it was reminiscent of the euro-style wood fired pizzas I've enjoyed in Austria and Germany and every bit as good as the pizza I ordered at from an authentic wood fired establishment in another city on my recent trip."}
{"text":"I love their pizza!!! Angelo made my pizza and he was very nice and funny. good customer service fast and fresh !!! BYO build your own pizza . The drinks are tasty and refreshing and unique blends"}
{"text":"I love BYO style . Fast and fresh toppings and cooked to perfection in 3 mins !!! Lots of selections and the drinks our unique and refreshing. Good alternative to sodas."}
{"text":"Great pizza as always. Service was amazing. They are busy during the summer with people wanting to try their pizza where you can pick your toppings and see them place it on your custom order. I've been here a couple times and always would come back if I'm in the area for pizza.

They mostly cater to the student crowd but the summer had more families grabbing a quick bite before heading off to their final destination. It is rare for a pizza chain to allow you a wide variety of toppings on your pizza and you control the portions. If you want more, they will do it but be careful how your creation turns out after they place it in the fast & furious oven.

We order lemonade as well but found it a bit too sweet so we mixed with water. Surprisingly, you can order beer which is rare for a fast food pizza joint. There was no problems finding a table and we were not rushed. We also had a good conversation with staff about the pizza and also gave tips on when to come to avoid the crowds.

if you want to create your pizza, this is the place to try out different combinations."}
{"text":"Great service! I prefer this place over pizza rev. Simple and fast. The employees there are very friendly. Definitely a place to get your personal pizza built"}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome here and I eat a ton of pizza from many different restaurants. I had the thick crust and my gf had a regular crust build your own.  Both crust were crispy (expected with such a hot oven) and had tons of flavor.  We really liked all the topping options and the size of the pizza.  I though the pizza looked small but I was stuffed when we left."}
{"text":"Cool store, coke products plus fresh juices, cool ingredients choices, friendly staff, pizza plus soda was about $10"}
{"text":"Really delicious, high quality, customized (or not) pizza. My boyfriend and I ordered a thin crust pizza loaded with vegetables. There is a a great variety of ingredients and there is no extra charge for adding different toppings which is great. They provide all the nutritional facts and calories off each topping which is a plus."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great, except their recent price hike :( pizza was a great deal for $5, now it's $8.  Can't come as often, and we used to get 4 pizzas, now only get 2.
(Note, I've only come for take out, the noise level would prob drive me insane if I were to eat in)"}
{"text":"My wife is a pizza snob and she loved Blaze. You can customize your pie or pick a crafted one from the menu. It's really fresh with quality ingredients and super quick. I like mine a little crispier so they left it in the super hot oven a little longer. Perfecto!Customer service at this location was outstanding. Steve, the NY transplant GM, was really helpful and made the experience that much better! He's building a great team and customer experience. At just under $8 bucks for a custom pie you can't go wrong. We'll be back for more Blaze goodness."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza \") the wait in line is too long but it's worth it indeed. You put whatever topping you want. Pick and choose like subway. Great food quality"}
{"text":"All I can say is HORRIBLE! If you don't try Blaze Pizza than your a horrible person. 

I don't care what the excuse is, go with a friend, go on a date just go because you will not regret it. 

My recommendation is to do the build your own pizza with original dough.

You can choose from a fantastic selection of topping (meat and non meat lovers) and for those who are feeling brave, you can try the pesto garlic sauce.

The staff is friendly, the pizzas are prepared quickly and the cost is reasonable  (down town reasonable)."}
{"text":"Love Blaze!  So many toppings, so much to love.  

This location's service is not as on point as their Eastern location.  These guys just move way slower and look like they don't really want to be there.  This has caused some pizzas to come out pretty burnt.  If management could get these guys in gear, it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the pizza.
4.5 for the service.
This is a solid 4 star place. 
I have been twice and each time the employees have been helpful. Shout out to Ash, who was friendly and seemed excited to be working for Blaze. It is nice to visit a business where the representatives appreciate customers and I definitely felt that here.
For under $8 you can get a pizza that you can customize with as many toppings as you like. Hint:Toppings are plentiful and fresh. Don't be afraid to ask for a double serving, some employees have mushrooms on lockdown!
A half pizza is enough for me, but when I reheated my leftovers in the oven the next day, it sucked. My man ate all of his pie, but his appetite is bigger than mine. I think the size is just right for guys.
Seating is limited but it seems like many take their orders to go.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I want to live here. 

For $13.15 (tax included), you can either choose a set pizza or build your own pizza with UNLIMITED toppings. 

Staff were super friendly and addressed you by name. They write your name on their pizza paper with a smiley face. They ask if it's your first time here and can guide you through the menu if you so wish. To speed up the build your pizza, have their online menu on your phone so you can list out what you want. 

For my pizza, I had red sauce and pesto sauce as my base. Meats were Italian sausage, grilled chicken, and Applewood bacon. Veg were mushrooms, pineapples, and olives. Sprinkled salt and oregano. Cheeses were mozzarella, ovalini mozzarella, and ricotta. The ricotta was amazing. Threw it in the oven for 180 seconds and the drizzled with olive oil. 

Interior was clean and you can sprinkle extra things from the shakers provided. Want Tabasco or sriracha? They have it too. Super spacious and bright. 

Drinks were some mango juice, blood orange lemonade, original lemonade, or the major brands of pop. A drink is $2.35 and its unlimited refills! 

Everything was beautiful. I love Blaze."}
{"text":"I received a coupon in the mail and decided to give this new place a whirl. I should have known something was up when I walked in, at 6pm, and I was the only person in there. Let me just say I'm glad it was free. There are a bazillion pizza places within a 1 mile radius and I regretfully don't see this place being open in a year, if that. The staff was super friendly but unfortunately the buck stopped there."}
{"text":"Not impressed, I take my pizza very serious. This place is alright if you're in the neighborhood but I wouldn't intentionally stop there. The service is great and the environment is cool just the pizza isn't great. Both the raised and thin crust are flavorless, yes you can add to it but it's doesn't help a whole lot. And random fact the straws crack easily I went through 2 straws that both randomly split while I was drinking."}
{"text":"I am vegan, and I am extremely picky about what I eat. Blaze pizza is wonderfully accommodating, even offering nondairy cheese and about 20 different kinds of vegetables. Their red sauce is vegan. They even ask if I would like them to change gloves before they make my pizza. I really like that they put extra care into piling on those vegetables! Nice crispy crust, I think we are going to be blaze pizza fans for a long time."}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is consistently good, no matter where we visit. We know we can always get vegan options, vegan cheese, fresh vegetables, servers who offered to change their gloves, and a nice thin crust pizza made exactly to our liking, because we go through the line and pick our own toppings. It is similar to a Subway sandwich shop except you end up with a fire grilled pizza instead of a sandwich."}
{"text":"Went here today with a friend. Had Never Been. This place is awesome! I was a little overwhelmed at first but Cody was Great and gave a basic rundown to get me started. All of the gentlemen were very pleasant (oddly i only saw 1 girl who was working the oven while there were 8+ guys, just a weird observation) Very reasonably priced, super delicious pizza, all very fresh looking toppings and quick service. I wish that there was a location closer to me because i would go here quite often. I also wish i had cash on me because i would have left a tip (not something i usually do at a fast-casual establishment)"}
{"text":"Attending the grand opening of this new Pizzeria in the Charlotte area.  I must admit their marketing was excellent for grand opening with a promotional pizza for those who stopped by to welcome them to the area. I had a Pizza with the there spicy tomato sauce on it topped with mozzarella cheese , jalapeño peppers, cherry tomatoes and pepperoni. This was a deliciously spicy combination which i enjoyed, as I like it hot. I must try them again when the wait is not so long in the line. Although I must admit that while staff for their promotion and it moves quickly based on the amount of people that were waiting."}
{"text":"Amazing place. The pizza here was definitely made to perfection - they got it down to a science with fresh dough made-to-order \"artisanal\" pizza. You can pick you own toppings and best of all its unlimited. The dough is so good (crunchy and chewy), the ingredients are fresh, and the sauces have much variety. The drinks even are a pretty unique bonus, they have this coconut and passionfruit \"agua frescas\", and blood orange lemonade at a fountain. The price point is really good too. You can have a great, filling meal for around $10."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I stopped by. The pizza was amazing. I enjoyed  the option of picking my own crust and toppings. For the lovely price of 7.99 I was able to get all the toppings I wanted on my personal sized pizza. My little ones chose extra cheese for their pizzas.There were plenty of options from cheeses,sauces, meats and vegetables. After making my selections the pizza was quickly cooked in a brick oven. 

They have a patio outside as well as indoor seating.The indoor dinning space was  a little small considering that the place had a consistent and long line of customers.  The line at times cut off some of the seating options. We found a spot towards the back, which we were able to easily utilize a high chair. Blaze was very clean and orderly. The staff were very friendly and professional. The carry out boxes were conveniently located near the soda fountain. I  would suggest they offer more beverage options.  Next time I would like to try the smores which they warm in the oven( yummy).

I will definitely visit again. The setting as well as the cuisine was very family friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza customized to your preference with a fast food style twist.  Dough is crispy on outside, chewy on the inside. Although I'd say it lacks a wood fired taste of apple wood as it's fired from a natural gas oven, it still tastes pretty good.

Cheese is of good quality. Sauce is little on the salty side.

Consider Blaze if you're craving a slice."}
{"text":"Pizza was really great. We thought the staff was very friendly and an overall it was a great addition to the neighborhood"}
{"text":"If you love pizza, the act of customization and not having to wait too long for food, then this is the place for you!

Located outside Sunridge Mall is Blaze Pizza, a fast casual restaurant where you design a custom pizza on the spot before it's speedily cooked in a giant wood-fired oven.

There are several crust, sauce, and cheese options plus many meat and veggie toppings available: all included at the fixed price.

My favourite combo includes:
- spicy red sauce
- goat cheese
- turkey meatballs and applewood smoked bacon
- sauteed onions, spinach, and roasted garlic and red peppers

The staff are quick and friendly and I appreciate that the nutrition information is posted in the store on each item and a nutrition calculator is available on the website."}
{"text":"fun! I did a double take reading the menu and that all toppings, as many as you want, are included on your personal pizza for the low price of 11.49. So lots of meat, veggies, cheese, as you like. Service was fast and friendly. I had fun picking my toppings. Pizza itself tastes great! A little greasy, not sure if that was the sausage or the bacon, or the crust. But did feel a little heavier than I expected.

There is seating. We came on Friday at dinner, relatively busy and took a couple of min to find one. It does feel like a fast food place, similar to chipotle or Freshii, definitely nicer than Burger King or Wendy's

This is a great place to share a pizza and have fun meal in Toronto"}
{"text":"Great. I have been twice and it's fast friendly and reasonably priced. Had low expectations but this place delivers exceedingly well. Great crust. Nice spicy tomato sauce. Perfectly cooked. Good job Blaze."}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza is very tasty and fast. The quailty of the food was great and staff was nice. They made sure my first time they explained how the process worked. The different flavored lemonades where excellent. I like that  they have gluten free options. The line waa long but it moved very quick. Their concept of \" fast food\" pizza works well for them and they make it look simple."}
{"text":"This location is just south of Mill Ave Party district. The parking is never scarce though. The prices are very reasonable and 1 full pizza is enough to take home half for a second meal (they actually have boxes set out that are shaped for half of a pizza). The food is really good and presentable and the ingredients look to be really fresh. The employees took their time with every pizza, yet made sure to get the line going as fast as they could. Blaze also has an abundance of unique beverage choices that you can't get anywhere else. It is also pretty clean and it's nice and big so there's plenty room to sit, even when it's super busy."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza some of the best crust in the neiberhood.  Great fresh topping selection kinda like the subways of pizza.  The staff was friendly and excited about the fresh products they offer. Will diffently be a new regular spot. Overwhelm by the great service I was received."}
{"text":"I tend not to easily assign 5 stars on Yelp, but Blaze deserves every star, seriously! Had a lot of friends recommend this pizza joint in the past, some even called it \"the best pizza place\" in Toronto, but I kept putting it off because I'm not a fast food/pizza person (trying to be healthy!) and although the location is convenient, particularly for UofT and Ryerson students, I'm not a huge fan of this super touristy, constantly buzzing area.

BUT I finally made it here for lunch on Saturday and I loved it! The service was super FAST (from the beginning of the order to getting your food literally takes 5 mins) and friendly. The place was pretty clean and had a laid-back but not ratchet vibe; there were enough tables and chairs for multiple groups to be seated. Most importantly, the pizza was amazing! It's true, you can put on unlimited toppings for the same price! And they have VEGAN CHEESE, which tasted just like dairy-based cheese. The topping options were all fairly fresh and they had some pretty creative ones, like zucchini. The crust is reasonably thin, but if you put on enough toppings 1 pizza should be sufficient or just slightly too much for 1 adult. Let's not forget the price -- $10.45 per BYOP = pretty cheap for a \"gourmet\" pizza imo.

Good job, Blaze."}
{"text":"This is a pretty interesting place! I think they opened a month and a half ago. You can either choose to build ur own pizza or choose one that they made for u. If u build Ur own pizza u can put as many toppings as u like! Will definitely come back:)."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Blaze. It was a good experience. 

A group of work peeps went to lunch today. At noon on Friday the line was a bit long, which is to be expected. Because of Friday lunch outings, parking in the back was limited. We found a spot thanks to the maneuvering of our chauffeur, oops...I mean co-worker. 

We waited in line about 10 minutes. Once I ordered, the line moved quickly. The staff was friendly and accommodating. I had the arugula salad and the kale salad with quinoa. I added chicken and peppers to the salad with balsamic dressing. The salads were super fresh and delicious. What truly made my salad was the dressing. Really, really good!  My co-worker gave me a sample of her pizza and it was good too. I could have eaten much more, but I'm (once again) watching my calories.

There were plenty of tables available and I didn't feel the occasional stress I feel when dining out and table space is sparse. 

There is one confusing part here and I KNOW it's me. I packed up my trash and walked to the trash bin and saw that it was for recycling.  OK, so then I walk to the other trash can and oops...same thing.  Where in the world do I put my trash? My co-workers explained that the trash goes IN the can and the recycling goes on top.  Duh!  I guess I need better signage on my trash receptacles. It made for a lighter moment, I guess.

All in all, a good place for lunch and I'm sure dinner. I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. This place has my heart in chains. Right at Yonge and Dundas, it's the hot spot for the children of rye high, the loungers of the square and 905-ers like moi, especially if you take public transpo, you can get off at dundas and it's a 3 minute walk. 

The great thing about this place is how happy the staff are, they're all SOO nice and definitely skilled (remember when I tried to twirl my pizza 180 just like them and almost had a heart attack because of how hot the fire oven was). They do it with such ease and makes it look hella effortless, but trust me.. it's not. The prices are very cheap for a good quality pizza, especially one that you can customize. $10.45 for a DIY pizza with perfectly done thin crust and any topping you desire? Soooo down. I love how they have vegan options too! Vegan pizza is the best pizza, no lie.

I always get the DIY with pesto x vegan cheese + basil x spinach x olives x red pepper and that baby is good to go! I top it off with even more pesto at the end and it's amazing and delicious. My date said it was a pretty bomb pizza, especially because the crust was thin and crispy and everything on top was perfectly cooked. 

10/10 would return to this place to blaze."}
{"text":"Really good custom pizzas, if you order online you can skip the lines. Their lemonades are also really good."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever.

Tbh I hate pizza, because I used to work at Boston pizza and just had enough of it. I came here because I wanted to give my love for pizza another try. And boyyyyyy have I seen the light. 

One pointier I will say is because you can get unlimited toppings I find that some employees don't put as much toppings, so you might have to say 'a little more' like five times. When I ordered for my boyfriends pizza I said can I get more chicken 4-5 times and he said there wasn't enough chicken."}
{"text":"Delicious & fresh tasting pizza! We are visiting from Atlanta & was recommended this place by a friend! Lots of different tops to choose from! Friendly staff! Inexpensive... $21 for two pizzas & two sodas! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to our neighborhood.  I like creating my own pizza from type of crust  to toppings.  The crust was thin and crispy.  The price is right.  What's not to like !!!"}
{"text":"Had a vegan pizza on their gluten free crust. It was decent. Not bad pizza and great service. The place had a cool vibe, open til midnight for you late night munchers."}
{"text":"I went in with low expectations. I'm Italian and I've had a lot of lacking pizza. That said, I was pleasently surprised.

I ordered a green stripe, which has chicken finished with pesto oil, along with a couple other things. The crust was light and seasoned, while the toppings were properly portioned. I devoured it.

The speed and efficiency on display is great, but there's a sense of teamwork, fun and accomplishment that comes off the staff that is rare for \"fast food\".  It's what brings me back time and again to Burrito Boyz and I hope Blaze finds the same success."}
{"text":"Yup. This place is legit.  
Got a Meat Eaters.  Crust, though thin,  it had the right amount of bounce and chewiness in each bite. 
Free Unlimited fresh veg toppings is a plus.  Bc Who doesn't like free schtuff!? 
I'm a pizza fanatic.. What makes a good pizza?  its all about the flavour of the sauce and crust. Sauce was the right balance of tang and sweet.  They also have the option of a spicy sauce. 
Lemonade/ flavoured water fountain is refreshing.  One of the flavours is like a virgin mojito. 
Service is fast & friendly-explaining how the menu worked. Each client who walks through the door is greeted and acknowledged. I like that!  
Location -right smack in the middle of dundas square- touristy location. 
Price point at 10.95 a pie, for a personal sized pizza is fair.  
Recommendations for other nearby places (by the slice) - Pizzaiolo at Yonge & Adelaide. They have delicious pizza too!"}
{"text":"Ummm hmmm.....pizza & blood orange lemonade is such a necessary combo!!! Link In pizza is great. What I like about this spot is the fired pizza concept, make your own along the way and the dough is great. Gluten free dough is available too.

Cons: its only open until 10 weekday and 11 on weekends."}
{"text":"First the crew they have working there is amazing,

Food was great tasted fresh, hot And cooked perfectly, 

They have a wide range of lemonades that are great I love the blood orange, 

Got the food quick and easy to find seating in door and out 

Brownies, are awesome desert."}
{"text":"You could easily say that Blaze Pizza is like Chipotle meets a pizza joint. It's more than that, though. There is a very large selection of toppings, so you can make SO many different kinds of pies. Everything looked market fresh and the taste surely was on point. My pie came out lickety-split & was nicely browned. I got the Red Vine: red sauce, ovalini mozzarella, parmesan, fresh basil, cherry tomatoes and olive oil drizzle. The crust was thin with a healthy crunch to it.  The red sauce had robust flavor. I made an executive decision to add some red onions and sea salt.  Overall, my pizza was delicious, fresh, and more than enough to feed one hungry person.

I finished the meal with the S'more Pie. This thing was legit!  Milk chocolate, marshmallow sandwiched between some graham cookies. They will warm this up for you in the oven so it is nice and gooey, as a s 'more should be! 

The staff was friendly and very attentive. A couple of them checked on my meal once I started to eat it and even offered to refill my drink for me. 

I highly recommend that everyone give Blaze a try, I think you will be pleased with what you find."}
{"text":"Love the concept!  Healthy and fast. 4 min to bake my pizza. I recommend this place to everyone :)"}
{"text":"This is easily my best pizza place in Toronto downtown. Convenient location and all you can choose Options lifts up your mood. 
I had one \"build your own\" pizza...and immediately ordered one more.. pizza ingredients are tasty and they oven fire gives an amazing taste to their pizza"}
{"text":"This place is everything!! On a recent vegan trip, I have been deprived of all the tasty foods that made my life even more worth living... that is, until I found out that blaze pizza offers vegan fare! Stepping in, I instantly felt like the sun was going to shine again, okay! They had the fires raging, toppings fresh and ready to blow my tastebuds away, and not to mentioned the staff was perky given it was only 10:30!  

To the eats. We went with 2-1 topping pies featuring red sauce, vegan cheese ( yesss lawd), and spinach. Still in the vegan struggle zone I chose the vegetarian option labeled Veg Out! We also accompanied the pies with a Cesar salad and the squash/ quinoa salad!  The pies were very tasty!! Crisp crust that was chewy on the inside, the red sauce was perfected (not too acidic or sweet), and all the toppings were delightfully fresh! Not to mention that vegan cheese melted! Heaven! 

All of this food was enough to satisfy my family of 6 and only costing about $35 that wasn't shabby at all!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy!
Always Busy but always a place to sit and eat.

If you are a regular, you can call in and take out...

Use their app also!!!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! I was a Ryerson student and I've been walking past this restaurant for over a year but I've never bothered to try it out thinking that it's just a typical pizza place and there are other less fancy pizza places for cheaper price. 

What got me interested is their Build your own pizza concept with unlimited toppings FREE ($12.85). I don't know any restaurant with this kind of offer and it is a very fair price in this market. When we went on Sunday evening at 6.45pm, there was a line-up to the door and it took us 10-15mins to get to the order-taking/build your pizza station. 

I chose half classic Tomato sauce and half garlic Pesto sauce with extra mozzarella cheese. The guy putting on the cheese only added a little more when I said extra though and it was a little awkward to ask him more. I then had Smoked Ham, ground beef, red onions, roasted garlic, spinach, green pepper, mushroom and pineapple. They then cook it in an open-fire-blazing oven. Waiting for the pizza to cook took 5-10mins. It didn't seem too long as the person prepping the cooked pizzas were doing his job so fast and it was entertaining/fascinating to watch. I then added barbecue sauce drizzle. 

Another reason why I love this place is their additional cheese, Tabasco sauce, Sriracha, herb, and chilli flakes available on the side. I am a cheese lover, and I like a little spiciness in my food. 

I will definitely come back. 

Food: 5/5
Price: 4/5
Cleanliness: 4/5"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, unlimited toppings, what more can you ask for? I love this place! It's pizza done right.

You can build your own pizza just like Harvey's/ Subways/Chipotle and there's no shortage of options. They have just about everything you would want on a pizza from the sauces, cheeses, proteins and veggies. You can make a pizza with your name on it, the way you want it. Are you a carnivore? Get all the meat, vegetarian? Get your veggies. They even have gluten free. There's really a pizza for everyone.

I asked for their spicy tomato sauce (which was really nice. There was a nice kick to it and added another dimension to tomato sauce), with ovalini and regular mozzarella with applewood bacon, Italian sausage and  pepperoni as my proteins. I got just about all the veggies you could get. I personally like thin-crust pizza so blaze's pizza was perfect. Perfectly ovened and was crisp and firm enough to hold all those toppings. 

Costumer service was phenomenal. They call you by your name every single time and were nothing but smiles. You barely had to wait 10 minutes for your pizza, that's impressive!

On an unrelated note, they were playing muse and silversun pickups overhead, my two favourite bands, so that was so nice to hear. Bonus points to blaze!

I am so impressed with blaze. It's my first time coming to a pizza place like this and I wish more places offer pizza with this kind concept. It's brilliant!"}
{"text":"I like it greatly, but once my brother and I got a pizza to go and came home to find a cricket baked in it. Guess they made the pizza so fast a cricket hopped in. Just wished they were a little bit more observant as he almost ate the cricket."}
{"text":"Omg! Def coming back. Hard to find a place that has the balsamic glaze for a topping! Loved my pizza!"}
{"text":"Super fast, super yummy pizza made to order. The toppings are fresh and there's tons of interesting variety - ovalini mozzarella, ricotta, crumbled meatballs, applewood bacon, roasted squash, basil leaves, several kinds of hot peppers, finishing sauces, etc. The employees were all friendly and came around a few times to ask how the pizza was. The only downside is that it's pretty noisy and sometimes it's hard to find a table. Overall great place to go for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Based on my interaction with one of the trainers I say this place deserves 5 stars.

It seems the company is very customer-centric and they want their custom pizza makers to be the same way.

I'm looking forward to visiting during the soft opening and for their free pizza offer later this week. My review will be updated then with pics and all that good stuff."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place! We have ate here twice in the last two weeks it is THAT good. we love it even more than we love pieology. It's super close to our apartment which is a plus and the prices make it even better. It's a build your own personal pizza kind of place and trust me you're gonna eat the whole pizza in one setting!"}
{"text":"The salads at Blaze are pretty dang great! The pizzas aren't bad either. I stopped in around dinner time and there was no line at all. The employees were knowledgable about the products, full of suggests on what to eat, and eager to assisted me. I ended up trying both the Kale & Quinoa and Arugula & Seasonal Fruit salads. Both salads were dressed perfectly and ridiculous tasty. Something I was not expecting from a pizza place! As for the pizzas, you can build-your-own at a flat rate. So you can add as many toppings as you'd like. For me that tends to be way too many toppings, but the crust at Blaze did a pretty good job holding up under the weight of it all."}
{"text":"Blaze pizza has been my favourite pizza place ever since I tried it for the first time last year. I've stopped going to other pizza places, because - why waste money? 

It's like a buffet-style pizza, where you can pick any toppings they have, as much as you want, on your pizza at less than $12 of price. They have various types of base(tomato, spicy tomato, cream, pesto), cheese ( I usually only put ricotta cheese. LOTS AND LOTS of ricotta cheese!), proteins, and veggies. After you create your own pizza, they bake it in an high-temp, open-flame oven for 3 minutes or so. After your pizza comes out, you can be more creative by putting arugula, balsamic dressing, or etc. Their pizza is great both in quality and quantity. I eat a LOT (like a cow), but I'm always very satisfied after finishing one pizza. Unlike most pizza's that makes you feel pretty greasy, I don't feel bad after finishing such a huge portion, since it's made healthy according to my own taste.

Blaze pizza is worth every single penny. Actually, It offers more than you pay: The service is quick, the place itself is spacious and clean, food is fresh, customized right at your taste and it does taste great!"}
{"text":"DAYAAM!!!!  A must try when at Dundas Sq.  Personal Sized thin crusted Za.  Me and my Nikki loved every bite.  Crispy all the way thru.  Tasty sauce.  Fast service.  Clean environment except for the odd Down Town Freakazoid walking by and or stumbling in.  LOL."}
{"text":"Stumbled on to it by accident. What a treat. Not some greasy bloated pizza offerings at all. Make a choice or build your own pizza or choose one of their specialties . Quick, tasty and very satisfying."}

I hate pizza & I was craving for a slice of really good pizza which was weird, I'm really picky & blaze just opened next to me so I decided to give it a try & I absolutely loved it!! everyone in there is overly friendly & nothing but smiles. if you're looking for some good fast pizza blaze is the place to go ! great prices too."}
{"text":"my husband & I are huge blaze fans. Great company & values. This location is kind of shitty and I've never had a bad experience with the company until here. Ran out of white sauce & tomatoes. Guy on expo station that cuts the pizza- we asked twice to cut our pizza in squares. The first time, he literally cut the pizza once, in half. Boxed it up and gave it to us. I opened it up, saw it, went back over to him and again nicely asked for it to be cut in squares or at least cut in a way that we could actually eat it. He cut it in triangles. Lol 
Don't get me wrong, I'm still going to blaze for all my pizza cravings, but screw this location."}
{"text":"Went to Blaze for the first time last night after a disgusting visit with Pizza Rev across the street. First off the workers were pleasant and professional and the quality and choice of topping was so much better than Pizza Rev. My daughter loved her plain cheese pizza and my wife and I loved our pizzas as well. We have found our new \"go to\" Sunday Pizza night place. Good job Blaze Pizza Henderdon !"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious and they offer gluten free crust  Every single employee has been exceptionally friendly and efficient. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"create your own fire oven thin crust pizza with unlimited toppings for under $15 and under 15 minutes- you can't get any better

I came here on a Saturday night around 9pm, there were still tables available. Join the line and like subway move down the counter to pick what seems like endless toppings with no restrictions! You can choose from red, spicy or white sauce. Lots of variety of cheese including fresh mozzarella, shredded, parmesan and including gourmet choices like gorgonzola and goat cheese. Lots of meat options as well which you can pick them all if you really wanted to. I opted for the italian sausage. Also a huge variety of vegetables from the usual peppers and mushrooms to arugula and artichokes. Seriously for about $12 load up on everythinnnnngggg!

Also got the blood orange lemonade which is also refillable by the way! Love how they also have take out boxes ready for you to grab on the side if you cant finish the pizza there. Seriously affordable, completely customizable. My friend and I who went wasn't that hungry and we were even full just by sharing 1 pizza."}
{"text":"Blaze fast fired pizza is just that, fast pizza. It reminds me of Chipotle in a pizza format. Rock your sauce, pick your toppings grab a drink and \"Presto\", you have pizza.

The crust is ok. The toppings were good. It was just quick pizza. No wood fired oven either. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the place. However, there was nothing that stood out either.

It is not a bad stop if your in the area. It is very sufficient. I have been to many other similar concepts and have preferred their crust a little more."}
{"text":"Lovvvve it here!!! So good i always get the build ur own pizza for 7.99 I believe generous size for 1 person u could probably share! The best part UNLIMITED TOPPINGS I get double, triple of any topping I please :) all for the same price! Plus delicious flavor & unique toppings such as pesto, fresh mozzerela,etc.."}
{"text":"Wow, great pizza!  We went for the first time to take advantage of the Pi Day pizza special.  It's way better than Pizza Rev.  They are very generous with the customized toppings. The personal pizzas will definitely fill you up, with a good chance of having at least a few slices left.  The food came out fast and the customer service was very good.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"No, this was terrible pizza.  First of all, the website doesn't say the size of the pizza - it is a little larger than a dinner plate.  We ordered 3 different flavors.  All three were burnt on one side.  Toppings were okay, sauce was okay but the crust - not so much.  The crust seemed to have two layers which came apart.  If you want a pizza fast and don't mind mediocre, then by all means feel free.  If you want a good pizza - well, all good things come to those who wait.  We tried Blaze because we got the card for a free pizza so figured \"why not?\"  We ended up tossing most of them.  It is really close to our home, but we will NEVER order from them again."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp - location is super convenient when in downtown as it's right in Yonge-Dundas Square. 

In a nutshell, you can build-your-own individual pizza for $11 with unlimited toppings - they have various options in sauces, cheeses, meats, and veggies. The pizza is then cooked in front of your eyes within a few minutes. 

I ordered a pizza with spicy tomato sauce, mozzarella, goat cheese, meatballs (they're Halal! No other meat is, but this was an awesome bonus), kalamata olives, jalapenos, and mushrooms.

The spicy tomato sauce was delicious - just the right level of heat for a pizza. Pizza was thin crust and tasty. My friend loved her custom creation as well. Awesome concept and executed very well :)"}
{"text":"Love Blaze, the pizza is awesome! Second to the pizza itself, is the staff. Most locations have a great cultural vibe from the staff, this location lived up to the experience we've come to expect! I also love that they offer gluten free crust, the staff even offers to change gloves to ensure no contamination. It's quick, easy and delicious, perfect for lunch or dinner. They also have a really cute and comfortable patio for when it's not \"blazing\" hot here! ;) Definitely recommend trying this place out, you won't be disappointed and will find a new favorite!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Bumping this up a star as the owner cared enough to reach out for additional details. An invested owner can make all the difference in turning a business around, so I expect improvement and was really impressed he immediately connected on it. Thanks!


First of all, we LOVE Blaze Pizza! This location though, I am not at all surprised to see such a low rating. We have been here twice, and both times have been terrible, today's was the worst. 

Visit 1: 
I ordered the Red Vine. This pizza only has cheese, sauce tomatoes and basil on it. They failed to tell me before making it that they were out of basil. Once they realized, they just shrugged it off like it shouldn't be a big deal, and didn't offer any alternative other than to make something else if they had to. It seemed they were annoyed at me for caring. The staff in general was completely unprofessional overall, including who appeared to be the manager.

Visit 2: 
When they removed my pizza from the oven it fell apart and they had to start over entirely. My husband's pizza was already boxed up and they didn't offer to keep it warm so it wouldn't be cold when mine was ready again for takeout. No apology offered that we had to wait for mine all over again, it was just an \"oops\" and annoyance they had to redo it. I had asked for extra basil which they didn't put on the second one. When the pizza was remade and finally ready, no apology for the 40 minute wait, the only thing was on the way out they stopped us to double check that they had given us the right pizza...?!

Just really incompetent staff overall at this location, which the staff is one of our favorite parts about other locations. This is our nearest location and we were so excited when it opened, but I am sad to say with two negative experiences now we will be taking our business elsewhere. The experience here is nothing like the Vegas locations we've frequented, or the Tempe location here. I want to make that clear, don't write Blaze off overall, their product is delicious!! But definitely think twice before visiting this specific location."}
{"text":"Freshly made pizza with unlimited toppings of your choice for one price...what more can you ask for?!

You can't go wrong walking into Blaze Pizza! Pick from one of their signature pizzas OR make your own - you can choose from classic red sauce, spicy red sauce, white sauce or even pesto! The number of choices is just overwhelming!

I've been here a couple of times already and I haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"I don't think you can go wrong with buying a personal pizza with all your favourite toppings! For $11.65, I would consider it quite the deal. I ordered one with meatballs, chicken, zucchini, mushrooms, pineapple, green peppers and spinach with classic tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. Their agua frescas and lemonade are also refreshing with their unique flavours!"}
{"text":"Love Blaze pizza! My first experience was in San Diego. I sat & ate the first pizza (yes, the first), & it was love at first bite (lol, I had to). Thin or thick crust...doesn't matter, both are gooooood! Pure deliciousness."}
{"text":"I love the fact that i can build my own pizza! not only is it thin crust and i dont get charged for the extra toppings but i know every ingredient that is place on the container is freshly made, the price is fair for the amount of toppings i request.  always busy but the people working are pretty quick and friendly"}
{"text":"This place has some great things crust pizzas. I love the BBQ chicken pizza with red onions. Price is a little on the high side given that it is a personal size pizza but they do have a very unique taste and set up so I guess that's worth the extra few bucks. Parking is a little bit of a pain during lunch and the traffic make it hard to get in and out of this joint during the week. However if your in the mood for pizza on a Friday night  or have a little extra time to spend Def give this place a shot!!"}
{"text":"I'm here 1-2 times a week for a couple months now. Love all the options, the customer service, the quickness to get my food, and the seating options/space!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! Which is always important to me. It was my first time here and they explained everything great. I love that you can get as many toppings as you want for one price. I got the art lovers with pesto drizzle. There were only a few people there when I went so the whole process was quick. For fast food, you couldn't ask for a better pizza. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to many of these fast casual build your own pizza places yet but I really like Blaze.  They use top notch ingredients and fresh dough they make in house every day.  I love the concept of being able to put whatever I want on a pizza because I can never decide in the first place.  It also has a great selection of fresh salads and sides including great chocolate cookies you can add on for dessert.  I also love the fact they have Mexican Coke available in the bottle.  This alone is usually a mark of a place that knows what they are doing and really care about the small things.  Quality all around here and I must say I really like the location as it is tucked away but very open with adequate outdoor seating when the weather permits.  My one regret is that I did not try the unique lemonade combinations they had on tap.  Will return!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience for a fast food pizza place. Great price for a freshly made/cooked pizza within 30mins or less then chiseling it down (don't forget to taste the toppings that you chose) yummy! They got a great setup 
for service and ordering not to mention the staff very friendly. 
 All in all a excellent place if you crave pizza. 
 
 Wish they had a crust that's thicker for it to be stuffed..."}
{"text":"Two words: soooooooooo goood
Love this place cause it's good pizza at a decent price (2 topping pizza + drink) at 15$ and it's soooooo good. Stone oven pizza is always the best but I also loved the service and energy of the place. Very well kept and always smells amazing. Will be coming back every now and then!"}
{"text":"Great place with quick and efficient service. Tasty little pizzas that everyone will love."}
{"text":"The pizza was absulutly amazing .
Love going to all their locations.
Highly recommend this place the guys that make the pizza are great"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up. Two pizzas, margarita, and pepperoni w/bell pepper. Was unimpressive."}
{"text":"Did something change here? My Red Vine pizza tasted horrible. The ingredients tasted quite different and I did not enjoy my pizza at all. I was surprised to find that the ingredients were very skimpy and not all slices had cheese on them. To much competition around!"}
{"text":"pizza was great.  toppings were stingy.  put them all on and they dont evem cook.  you get a doughy pizza then"}
{"text":"Awesome thin crust pizza! Quick and great service. Pricing is way more reasonable compared to the others. Would def recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited this place because my boyfriend and I got a coupon in the mail. The first time we tried going the line was all the way to the door so we decided to leave. Second time we tried line was the same but we decided to stay. First of all this is a copy of what fired pie is except their ingredients quality is not the best. After going we understood why the line is so long. The system they have in place sucks there's 6 different people working on your pizza and all of them are teens who honestly seem not to have a clue of what they are doing. They are running back and forth passing the pizzas to each other.The pizza dough is horrible. We would of been better buying a frozen pizza and baking it at home. If you don't have a coupon don't waste your time and money coming here. We are definitely not coming back. Go to fired Pie which is not far away from this location or to sauce right around the corner."}
{"text":"Finally got to come in after the AMAZEBALLS Elite event a little bit ago. 

It was just as that time (except not as packed). The service was just wonderful. I got to put everything I wanted on it plus the made it extra extra well done. I even got a compliment on how yummy mine looked. The staff was even nice enough to ask me when I ordered the Gluten free crust if it was \"preference\" or \"allergy\". That to me was very important- they would have given me knowledge on what I could put on my pie as far as ingredients. All in all this place is aces! Enjoyed every bite to the end."}
{"text":"Wow I'm so impressed by the customer service I received and the quality of the food ! I personally only had 1 nite since it was for my 10 yr old son and he said it was \"Freaking Delicious\" the quality of the meat & cheese was exceptional! 

I feel like the sauce was a bit plain and needed salt but that was an easy fix.  

I need to give a big THANK YOU to the crew working that night 
Xavier, Heather, Emma and Natalia !  

All of them were just fantastic they treated me so nice they all smiled and I really appreciate the great customer service ! It was genuine and sincere

Great prices and they don't charge you additional money for toppings 

We will most definitely be back"}
{"text":"First time trying Blaze pizza today and I must say it definitely sets the bar high for fast casual pizza. I've been to MOD and Fired Pie before and I like both of them and Blaze stood out in some ways above the other two. First off, I think they have the best cheese selection out of all of them. They had fresh mozzarella and goat cheese! Really creamy and the ricotta cheese was very good as well. As far as meat and veggies go, pretty standard. Nothing that blows the other pizza places out of the water. 

I usually get the pesto at these types of places but their pesto was not appealing to the eye so I decided to pass and just do olive oil. I really liked how they had zucchini as a topping too. Ranch was okay but their balsamic glaze was tasty. They also have really cool and unique sodas and their blood orange lemonade was really good. Lastly, their cookie was dang good. They even warmed it up so it was nice and gooey. Beautiful. Service was also really awesome, super friendly staff. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I really like blaze pizza. Out of all the fast casual pizza restaurants, I definitely think blaze is up there. They have a pretty good selection of cheeses, meats, and veggies that you can top your pizza with. I always do the build your own pizza and it ends up costing a little under 10 bucks. Not a bad deal. I enjoy their pesto their dough turns out nice and crispy. I also like how you can get side sauces such as buffalo and ranch. Their balsamic glaze is really flavorful as well. Service is good but it can take a while to get your pizza depending on how busy they are. Definitely recommend for a fast casual option in the central Phoenix area."}
{"text":"If you love blood orange lemonade and s'mores dessert then this is place for you! However, if you want pizza I have tons places that are better. This is cheap pizza with cheap ingredients. 

Folks if you like it cheap, this is your heaven! If you like it good, keep driving!  Enough said."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, good price, and unlimited toppings! Tried the meat eater and BBQ chicken. Meat eater has delicious meatballs on them. The BBQ chicken only has a BBQ sauce drizzle on top,no red sauce base but still good. Planning to try the link in next time I'm back"}
{"text":"Hands down to Blaze! Family friend pizza place. Great prices, helpful and friendly employees. Love how they add new items to the menu and do seasonal drinks. I'm a regular customer, employees like Maria and Gaby know me and greet me with a smile.  Place is neat and bathrooms are clean. Great management."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because I used to go to another pizza joint with the same concept, called Novecento- but their service is just horrible and started to hate going there. So imagine my excitement when a new place just opened up and had great reviews.

1. The inside is beautiful, it has a very trendy and hipster vibe- I loved it! 

2. The customer service was EXCELLENT- every worker was moving-fast! They all had smiles on their faces even though they were slammed (went on a Saturday night)

3. Pricing is MORE than fair, seriously I was used to paying about 16 dollars over at Novecento and here it was 8! Plus they sell alcohol to go with your pizza ;) 

4. Taste- it tasted great and very fresh, plus how it works is they give you a slab of dough and you choose everything from the type of  sauce, cheese, and all the toppings you can even imagine. Its like a subway but for pizza! 

Overall, I will be coming here from now on! It was a really great experience and I'm glad I have found a replacement from the last joint I used to go to. Great job! :)"}
{"text":"I was super impressed!! My Pizza was great! We went on a Wednesday so there was no line or crowd. The pizza was ready fairly quickly. I will definitely be back soon. Didn't get any pictures (sorry) but I will next time. It's a yes from me! More to come."}
{"text":"I went to blaze pizza 4 or 5 years ago when it first opened up in Irvine, CA. I remember they used to limit the amount of toppings you could put on your pizza which was a huge drawback. In addition, I don't remember anything memorable from that experience. After that one time, I always went to pieology. 

I was looking for a pieology in the henderson area after moving out here, but they didn't seem to have any around. I opted to try Blaze again after a mediocre experience waaaay back and was pleasantly surprised at how much better it got. 

The original sauce that they use has a tangy flavor which is nice. I don't think pieology's tomato sauce was quite as good. It was also nice to find out that they don't limit the amount of toppings for a build your own pizza. All in all, the toppings were pretty fresh and the pizza turned out great. I would say the pizza turned out slightly better than pieology's. 

I will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Honestly not worth the hype. The pizza dough fell apart really easily when you picked it up. There was not much flavor at all. I was not impressed. It's just another pizza place.
To me, the red sauce was too sweet. I had pepperoni that was very bland it was actually impressive how bland it was. Would rather have Pieology over Blaze. Is was a good experience and I tried it. On the bright side their water didn't taste like tap water like some places do."}
{"text":"Fast and delicious!! Vegan options too! Kids loved the smores heated by the fire!!
Great service!!"}
{"text":"Hands down we always get fantastic service here. The lines are quick and the food is great! They have calorie counts on everything. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Awful.  Pizza was burned, not cut correctly, didn't even taste good...  We ordered a regular cheese pizza and a BBQ chicken...  How do you screw that up?"}
{"text":"Chipotle for Pizza. You can't beat the build your own. The quality is awesome especially for a quick pizza, and the price. 

Tell em what dough you want (they have gluten free dough for an up-charge), tell them what sauce you want (I like the white sauce), tell them what toppings you would like (I like the getting a ton of different meats with feta and mozzarella cheese. Don't forget the bacon and roasted garlic), they cook it and you roll out. Easy, simple, quick, and delicious. 

My Advice: Check your pizza when they hand it to you to make sure it is yours. Sounds stupid but when they pull pizza's from the oven sometimes they take the little metal number off the pizza which tells them who's pizza is who's then hand the wrong pizzas to people. Created a lot of confusion and mistaken pizzas being handed out when I was there. I will chalk that up to a one time mistake when they had just opened."}
{"text":"Come before or after lunch hour or you'll wait forever!! The pizza selection is good and their sauces are tasty. Not to mention their gluten free option!!! Very yummy!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to have a pizza with a friend of mine it was both of our first times dining in. I was pretty pleased with the variety and the fresh toppings are on display in front of us to choose from when building a custom Pizza. I will say however the crust was not as firm as I'd like. This is probably an easy fix considering an extra 20 to 30 seconds in the oven would surely get it to the point we like. I would recommend trying it out however all a cart on the spot pizzas don't seem to have the same sort of texture and flavor as those that are baked at a slower rate."}
{"text":"PI DAY: in celebration of this amazing day, next Tuesday (March 14th), allllll pizzas will be $3.14 for the whooole day. I can't believe it either, but go tell your friends! I absolutely LOVE pizza and Blaze, so maybe I'll see you there!"}
{"text":"Build you own pizza for less than $11!! And did I say UNLIMITED toppings??Three doughs available: original (thin), gluten free and rising dough. Except for the original dough, you have to pay extra ($3-$4). 

They have so many toppings to choose from that you just get overwhelmed if it is your first time ordering here. Like any other fast food, you see them build your pizza. Start with the sauce (four different sauces), cheese, meat, veggies, and you can also add fresh arugula, drizzle olive oil, pesto sauce, or hot sauce once the pizza is baked (in the fire oven). The original dough is SO GOOD and crispy. Very quick and efficient (takes less than 7min from the dough to the finished pizza). The staff is very helpful, friendly, and lively. 

Seriously, you need to try this place out if you want a quick bite. You can either make a really healthy pizza or an indulgent pizza! Also, each table has parmesan, chili flakes, and hot sauce.  This has become my go-to fast food joint in downtown."}
{"text":"So good. Love putting every topping on for one fixed price. If you're in to go here for pizza"}
{"text":"I thought I would check this place out while in the area to see what the fuss was all about.  Overall, I like the concept, staff very friendly and its clean inside.  The crust was nice - thin, crisp, nice char but soft and pillowy inside, although it lacked the nutty flavour of the old school pizzas I am used to. The toppings were fresh and I like the fact that they allow you to finish the pizza with basil or condiments at no extra charge.  

The only flaws I noticed was that the red sauce was too sweet for my liking and mozzarella cheese was a bit bland (had little flavour or stretch that i expect with pizza cheese) and they were skimpy on it.  In terms of chain pizzas, I rank them ahead of most with maybe Pizzaollo and Pizza Nova ahead of them.  The cost for a 11\" pie with 3 toppings was $13.15 tax incl.  I can get a 12\" pie from Bitondos or Pizza Gigi for roughly $14 and they taste a whole lot better."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service
For around $12 you can add as many toppings as you want on your personal pizza
Pizzas are thin crust and come in one size
Takes about 10 min for pizza to be made
Would definitely be coming back
Highly recommended 

I got the meat eaters pizza with double to triple the meat"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food! This place is great if you want pizza quick with great flavor. The pies are big enough for you to finish without feeling like a pig. The \"Build Your Own\" bar works perfectly for the amount t of people coming in the door. The service was wonderful. I'll definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Wow! This is some of the best pizza I've had. I'd say it's on par with my New York pizza that I still dream about. I had the Red Vine which was simple but delicious! Will add mushrooms next time for fun. Had two pieces left over as it was lunch and just couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"Cue the sad trombone music. 
After being an avid fan of this location for years (despite only writing a review this year-oops) I had an awful experience on April 2nd around 11:30. Nuvia was assigned to making our pizza. She mumbled the whole time so we couldn't hear her and wouldn't repeat herself when asked. We were splitting a pizza 50/50 and she didn't disperse the toppings evenly-we had to ask her to redo the meat as the \"half\" with pepperoni had about 9 pieces of pepperoni covering two or three bites right on the crust. They were out of cherry tomatoes (which I know isn't her fault), but the BLT salad had cherry tomatoes. That leads me to question when the salad was made if they didn't have any fresh tomatoes...Speaking of the salad, it's already pre-made and just needs to be boxed up when you order it. It wasn't given to use when we paid, or when our pizza was ready. I had to go ask Bob, the cashier, for our salad. He asked Julia if she had made that salad yet, to which she responded \"LOL NO\", literally laughing at him as I'm sitting here waiting for the salad 15 minutes after we ordered it. Julia finally boxed the salad up, but then I had to wait for them to find a container to give me dressing. They were totally disorganized. There were probably 8-10 people behind the counter and a grand total of 6 customers who had all ordered at separate times and they couldn't get it together. Another gem of this experience? There was a new girl training and I overheard them telling her that secret shoppers are older people and to treat them differently, cater to them, etc. Oh, ok! Good to know that those of us who aren't \"older\" get sub-par service because there's no chance we're secret shoppers. Such a joke. It will likely be a while before we head back to this location. Yesterday's visit left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Really cool, took my husband there for his birthday with the kids , it's like a subway for pizza. For a reasonable flat fee you get what you want and they cook it super fast in their pizza oven. Best part was I stayed within my weight watchers points. We all enjoyed it we all got our own pizza and ceaser salad for all. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Omg. Amazing pizza!!! You can put ANYTHING on top... taste amazing. The first pizza that made me fall in love with pizza."}
{"text":"Yassss! Chipotle meets pizza?! Is this real life? 

You can pick as many toppings on a build your own pizza for just $7 bucks and some change. That's a good price especially for people like my fiancé who load on the toppings ten miles high. 

One other cool thing I enjoyed is you can mix the sauces to make your own sauce! How cool is that? The spicy red sauce with the regular sauce is on point! 

Other than the pizza the smore pies are yummy and they warm them up for the full campfire effect. & there blood orange lemonade is a nice switch up to the oh so common strawberry lemonade. 

Also the staff was extremely welcoming and nice! We shall be back :)"}
{"text":"I placed an online order for a barbecue chicken pizza. My order was without Gorgonzola and the banana peppers but I DID include the chicken. As you can see from the photo, I literally only got four small cubes of chicken on top of my pizza! Haha It still tasted ok but obviously they really need to work on including toppings that should be included with your order."}
{"text":"Ive been to these places before, always thought they were a dcecnt deal, good food, at ok prices. This place is flat out better. Where else can you get a pizza in less than 5 minutes, with anything you want on it, for less than $8? AND HAVE IT TASTE GREAT? You're not going to find it at many places except for here. Ive been there 7 times now, and havent been disappointed once. Ive tried 6 different pies, and each one has been great. There perfect for 1 person, or if your just grbbing a snack, 2 can share, but its a meal for 1. The great thing is, even if there busy, your not going to wait long at all. If the line is at the door, and your building a pie to bring home, your in and out in 10 minutes at the most. Thats at a busy time. Walking in, ordering, and waiting for 2 pizzas, your out in 7 minutes. What more can you ask for??? Check it out, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is 2nd time in the past week I came in and the service was verrryyy slow!   What happened to this place?   It use to be the best."}
{"text":"Love this place. You gotta check it out people! Don't forget the s'mores sandwich!!! Make sure you say hi to Daniel and Isabelle when you go in."}
{"text":"Out of all the Blaze pizza locations I've been to, this is my absolute favorite! Not because of the ingredients or the location, but because of the customer service! I've never had someone who wasn't bubbly and fun make my pizza. If you've never been to Blaze and you love pizza, give this location a try! The fresh mozzarella is to die for! It's the only ingredient I get on my pizza every single time I visit. They even have a reward system so every 10 transactions you get some reward! Their teas are also very unique and tasty. Come in to Blaze to get your inexpensive custom pizza to your liking!!"}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick, easy and delicious dinner out. Nothing better than fresh, piping hot pizza with all YOUR favorite toppings and nobody else's on it. My kind of place."}
{"text":"Good pizza, not careful with allergies.  Serving employee asked if she was gluten free and wife answered \"allergic\".  Oven handlers set normal pizza on my wife's order paper, cut the pizza, realized it was the wrong order and then shifted the pizzas around.  Took wife's pizza out of the oven and cut with normal pizza cutter.  No glove changes either.  Contamination from the gloves, paper, and pizza cutter.  My wife tried to be a good sport about it, ate her gluten free pizza, but threw it up within minutes from the contamination.  Such a bummer."}
{"text":"Great idea to be able to create your own pizza and the price ($7.65) is right on for the size you get. I am a meat lovers pizza kinda guy and the #1 reason I will come back and bring my friends is because they let me put as much  toppings as I like. Keep in mind though that the crust is VERY thin, so the more toppings you put on the less firm the slice is when you go to eat it. Great variety of toppings and fast service. I will be back at least 1-2 times a week. Chipotle will be seeing me less:-) Their prices have gone up considerably and the quality of food or portions have NOT."}
{"text":"Really neat pizza place. I enjoyed picking my toppings knowing the price was already set. The employees were friendly and kept asking \"how's that look?\". They were more than happy to add more if I asked."}
{"text":"When I first walked into blaze, there was a really long line and I debated leaving, but I'm glad I didn't! The line went by faster than I expected and when I got to the front I understood why there were so many people. The employees behind the counter were very kind and took their time with each pizza and made sure it was made well. The ingredients all looked super fresh and it was clean where they were working. The pizza was reasonably priced and tasted amazing. If you come here I recommend the spicy sauce and adding salt and oregano after, it makes the pizza! The thing that I like the most about Blaze is their beverage choices! There are a bunch of unique juice like beverages and some soda ones too. I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!
If your are a pizza lover and really want to have it your way, this is definitely the place. Very clean and the staff is all about ensuring customer satisfaction. A great place to dine in"}
{"text":"Horrible. We ordered 4 pizzas and 3 of them were wrong. One wasn't even cut, a signature pizza was missing two of the main ingredients, and the other build your own was supposed to be a white pizza with veggies but was red sauce with bacon. Completely wrong...... (these were all ordered online, so each pizza clearly stated what should be on it) 

So I try to call after we left (it was a pick up order) and the phone lines won't work.... so I reached out to the phone order line and they proceed to tell me they cannot do anything for me since they also can't get in contact with the store it's manager... 

So I ask what they can do to help rectify the situation.... she says sorry can't do anything.... so I say may I speak with your supervisor as we just spent over $55 for food that isn't correct. She says \"they aren't available\" ...... isn't that convenient? Hmmmm..... awful experience and incredibly disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing build your own pizza you pay one price and get what ever toppings u want staff was super friendly a lot of toppings to pick from and they have beer and wine"}
{"text":"Great pizza, very fresh ingredients with quick service. We went shortly after they grand opened and the staff seemed well train and with good attitudes. We also went when they were doing free pizza and the line was out the door. It was almost closing time and we were given a free pizza coupon. That definately works for us and we will be back."}
{"text":"Great, simple build-your own, quick fire pizza place. They have a variety of toppings and recently added a thicker crust option. They offer GD and VEGAN items! Their product is always fresh. 

Employees are always in great moods and very friendly! Love coming here."}
{"text":"Good pizza. I only had the red vine pizza with spicy tomato sauce. It was really good, however there wasn't enough mozzarella cheese. If you like crispy pizzas reminiscent of pizza in Roma, Italy youwill like this place."}
{"text":"Well my first experience was a great one, this place is all it's hyped up to be and some! You basically have to create your own taste with this place and if you're not good with tht then it may be a bust for you! U have to be a real pizza lover to know what your looking for! Barbecue chicken pizza was all the way on point!"}
{"text":"I'm hooked. This is my absolute favorite fast fired pizza place. They have won my allegiance. The price is perfect for what you get. I'm very impressed. I love that you can make it any way you want and it's ready in minutes. Great pizza. I ordered mine online so it was mostly ready when I arrived they just had to put it in the oven and I was on my way. It wasn't that busy when I was there, but I've heard it can get crazy. I ordered the roasted garlic and they were giant pieces of delicious garlic... next time I'm going to try for crushed garlic as it was a little too much garlic at a time. :) Service is fast and friendly. They seem very efficient and organized. I can't wait for my next pizza!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and it was charred all to hell. They did offer to remake it, but that seemed like a cumbersome process and I don't have the luxury of having an infinite amount of time to eat my lunch. 

The pizza tasted about as bad as it looked. Any notes from the toppings were overshadowed by the taste of burnt crust. It is better than big chain delivery pizza, but that's about it. 

I would recommend nearby Brixx or Fuel over this establishment. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm completely in love with this pizza. I absolutely love that I can pick anything I want at no additional charge. I love the five dollar Mondays. Think of it as a subway but for pizza. You go along the line and you let them know what you want on it. Once it comes out of the oven you can top it off with a nice olive oil or pesto glaze. It's literally the only pizza I really get anymore."}
{"text":"We have been here several times now- even enjoyed it in LA outside of Universal Studios.  I love thin crust pizza and while it isn't a nicer thin crust style that I enjoy at places like Cibo, Azzuri, Scopa, etc- it does the job of a thin, tasty crust and quite delicious toppings options.  The crust is a little too crusty but easy to get over that- just don't set yourself with high expectations, it is still fast food.....I love that you can top your pizza with arugula.  Prices are also quite decent considering this is \"fast food\" pizza.   I even have the app- if my picky kid can eat a whole pizza here, I'll take it!
Hmmm, I'd liken this place to Ripe Tomato but has the appeal to my kids that Lebron James owns this (or used to)."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a great price.

Think Subway, but for pizza. You pay a flat fee of around 12 bucks and you get a personalized small pizza in front of you in about 10-15 minutes. I'm already thinking of different topping combinations I'll use for future visits as I write this review. If I were a Ryerson student, this place would be a VERY regular lunch spot for me. If you want a relatively quick, cheap bite around the Dundas Square area, look no further.

It turns out, the King does know best."}
{"text":"Stopped in here because the new Thai place had a 35 min wait for lunch after you order so we went next door. Turns out, this place was solid. Super nice people with great service, unlike he Thai Chili joint next door. Fastest pizza ever and really good. It's sort of a Chipotle style pizza shop that has fast turnover.  We will definitely go back. Thai Chili, doubtful."}
{"text":"Honestly, to me, for the price, the pizza is mediocre. I do love that you can get whatever meats, cheeses, veggies and more on your pizza for practically the same price, so if you love tons of stuff on your pizza it's worth it. The pizza is to me bland, and there is nothing special about the crust. Service is always on point though here at the Decatur location. I'll come back every now and then when I get the chance"}
{"text":"Yes the best pizzas I have ever had . Love these fired pizzas, especially the one with white sauce. Great ambience too."}
{"text":"Great value and good quality, tasty ingredients!  It's kinda like Chipotle where you go down the line and they put on whatever toppings you want then they cook it up for you.  Takes about 7 min for it to cook.  The only complaint I have is their beer and wine service.  EXTREMELY slow.  They won't give the alcohol to you until you are actually sitting down in your seat.  You're not allowed to carry it to your table yourself.  I know I've ordered beer at Chipotle and they give it to you right at the counter.  Maybe the liquor laws have changed in the last few months or something.  Anyway it's a great place with reasonable prices.  Just don't like the hassle with the beer & wine."}
{"text":"I have come to this location about 10 times during the week and have always had fast and friendly service.  However, this evening was a nightmare experience.  It took 5 minutes before we were acknowledged and then one of our pizzas was made and in the oven before the other was started.  There were 4 staff members behind the counter talking instead of providing service.  If this was my first experience at a Blaze franchise, I would not return especially when there are so many amazing fast pizza places around.  I would encourage management to take a close look at the staff on schedule on Saturday 5/12 at 7 pm. I would make sure they are supervised more closely if this store is to survive."}
{"text":"I LOVE being able to customize my own pizza. The ingredients are different, delicious, and fresh. Wish there were more meat options and that they told you about the free \"finishers\" that can be put on after it comes out of the oven. But I went over there with my last two slices and the guy hooked me up with some fresh arugula on top!! Even if you're getting red sauce try pesto on the crust... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was actually pretty good! The best of the \"create your own pizza places\".  The crust was nice and crispy and not soggy even though I got many toppings. They have lots of topping options-including ricotta which my family loves :) I like that they have a price for just a cheese pizza and it was very reasonable- 5.95 I think it was.  My kids really enjoyed it and we did too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Price is great and the pizza is awesome you can customize it to your liking and when your satisfied they toss it in the wood fired oven and within a couple minutes you've got your pizza."}
{"text":"We love Blaze Pizza, and this new location was offering BOGOs so we decided to drop in. 

The manager was very cool, offering us a coupon on our next visit as well. Our pizza builder didn't seem to have a good grasp on portions, throwing way too many greens on, and making a pretty sloppy looking pie.

The pizza tasted good as always. Aside from the friendly manager, this location just felt a little unorganized compared to the usual Avondale Blaze we visit."}
{"text":"If I could give them anything less than this 1 star I would. Worst customer service ever! Did the on-line ordering showed up right on time to pick up my order and they served 5 other customers that just walked in AFTER me  before they even made the pizza I had ordered 1 hour before showing up!! Never going back here again! I recommend going across the street to Pizza-Rev. much better service there and they get your order out right away!"}
{"text":"Okay...I can finally give  this  place 2 thumbs up ...I'm beginning to try a place at least 3 times before leaving a review.  Each time I've had the same pleasant experience.  Smiles,  friendly,  fast & appetizing.  Plus, you can't beat the price. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I went here to try it out. It looked appealing and new. I got my pizza, ate all but one slice. The last slice had someone's hair baked into it. Wearing just a hat on a food service line isn't always the most effective way to keep your nappy hair from falling into a customers food... I decided not to make a deal of it because the thought of getting a free pizza in return of my complaint just sounded like a hairy idea. So I simply threw away the rest and walked out and won't return."}
{"text":"Certainly, one of the good Pizzas in town. The place has an option to customize your Pizzas or choose one of their signature dishes.. Ordered Veg Out Pizza with Garlic Pesto  sauce and several toppings..  strongly recommended"}
{"text":"I like the concept of customization of pizzas. Really nice place to go  to get A quick good Pizza!"}
{"text":"I love BLAZE pizza they have Daiya cheese and lots of veggies! I have tried other fired pizza locations and there is something about BLAZE that pops and makes me want to keep coming back. There is a private lot which is helpful during my lunch break and usually there is not much of a wait the first 30 mins they are open. The staff is friendly and they check on you if you dine in. For the average price of $8 this is a great spot for lunch or a casual dinner. Don't forget to download their app for customer loyalty points and freebies."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service and price. The concept is cool and there's a great vibe to the restaurant. Jared met us at the door and gave us a great run down of the menu. Attentive and engaging staff. The Blood Orange Lemonade is killer! Great start to this place and I'm hopeful it's around for a long time.

Pros: Food selection, price and vibe
Cons: None

Wish they had Green Chile :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant reminds me of a Southern California chain restaurant that is trying to be too trendy .. the restaurant looks like a food court in a mall ... the only problem is the food quality seems like food court quality too.... soggy crust and sausage had a lot of gristle.  I think this is a one and done for me."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good, got the regular cheese pizza. 
Seating is limited and it's a very popular joint! 

I would make sure you get someone to save you a spot."}
{"text":"Around $11 for a pizza is on the expensive side for a pizza, but you get to choose all your toppings and have it made in a few minutes. Do feel free to put anything you want on your pizza, we got to the end of the ingredients list, and realized we should have put some more things on it at the beginning - different types of cheeses and meats. I saw a few people doing this, so I realized, but you can have half your pizza with one sauce, and one with another, which I thought was a very cool idea.

When we came around 1pm on a Friday, there was a long lineup, but it moved fairly quickly. About half their customers choose to eat-in, so spots are definitely limited during peak hours."}
{"text":"IfI could give it 12 stars I would.  First, the food is amazing.  Good quality fresh toppings. The dough is always perfect.  The causes are all excellent.  Their blood orange lemonade is amazing.  However, what truly sets Blaze apart, is the people.  I have never seen a staff member without a smile.  I witnessed one staff member being asked to perform a task in a different way, and she thanked her manager for telling her the correct way to do the task.  

On my third visit last night, I was nearly moved to tears by the kindness of the staff.  I had a friends kids after working on an art project with them at a local gallery three blocks away.  I wanted to treat them to a special build your own pizza.   So, we walked.  I had taken my computer bag into the gallery and just assumed my wallet would be in there.  When I got to the check-out, it was not there.  I know I was blazing red.  I was trying to decide if I would leave the kids there, run back and get it.  Make them walk with me before eating.  See if they would let us bring back the money after the dinner.  Before I could process it all, the manager at the cash register had taken care of it.  

Needless to say, I am spreading the word on this restaurant.  Please visit and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is revolutionary. Cheap fast delicious pizza for sure!! Staff is amazing. Megan and Madison were at the cash register and they were super friendly. Jose cut the pizzas to perfection. I can't remember the other staffs names but literally all of them were the dream team that made everything run smooth. Anytime we have friends in town we always take them here. Must try place!"}
{"text":"Everyone is always extremely nice. My pizza is always delicious and there are tons of options for everyone."}
{"text":"Love the decor! And the pizza! I loved the toppings they have and I usually ask for all of them. I had like 4 layers of cheese and it made the pizza so amazing along with all of the veggies and meats. Other places skim on their toppings but not Blaze. That's what I judged it on. And the fact that their oven makes their pizza crust really good. So the pizza came out pretty fast and looked pretty good. And it was delicious. No complaints here!!!"}
{"text":"Ever since the dawn of our beloved Angelfire websites when being html-savvy was cool and the antiquated MySpace age where changing your top 28 on the daily was stylin' -- we, as a whole, love the idea of customization. Both sites are obviously so passé now, but flash forward to 2016 where pizzas have cornered this very niche of selective assembly... and there seems to be no shortage.

If you're new to these fast-casual pizza joints, think Chipotle and Subway. You'll basically stand in line, pick your preferred sauces and toppings (unlimited), usually for around the $8 price point. Then, a few minutes later, your personal pie's ready. All of them operate fairly similarly and honestly, I'm not really a fan as they all taste the same to me... but if I HAD to choose one, I'd probably pick Blaze. 

Why? Because they're the only ones that didn't burn my pizza. And, there's an upgrade option for a high-rise dough for those that require a little more crust action (other places are usually only thin crust, susceptible to charring). I didn't get this option on my visit, but I do love me some crust handles. 

My pizza ended up with these ingredients: red sauce (the spicier kind), mozzarella, light ricotta (mmm!), chicken, light sausage, artichokes, mushroom, spinach, and tomato. For drinks, try their blood orange lemonade! Okay, that's all you \"knead\" to know. \"Piece\" out!"}
{"text":"Where has unlimited pizza toppings been all my life and why haven't I discovered this sooner????

If you don't want to create your own you could get curated toppings. I recommend build your own because it costs relatively the same and you can customize to your hearts' desire.

I was surprised at how generous the pizza makers were with the toppings. I thought they would've given increasingly less quantity as I called out more toppings but they stacked and stacked. The service was impeccably fast, pizza took no longer than 10 mins from start of the creation to stomach.

I eat with my eyes and was waaaaay too aggressive with the toppings. Everything looked so good and I'm indecisive so I decided to have it all. Here's what I put on mine:

* Half pesto and half classic red (but because of the topping, I couldn't really taste the base sauce. Both halves tasted the same to me)
* Italian meatball
* Applewood Bacon
* Grilled Chicken
* Fresh Mozzarella 
* Shredded Mozzarella
* Feta
* Mushrooms
* Sautéed onions
* Pineapple
* Spinach
* Sautéed zucchini
* Roasted peppers
* Oregano

There was zero flavour cohesiveness in my pizza but I don't care, it still tasted amazing to me with all the toppings I love.

I highly highly recommend the fresh mozzarella and the Italian meatball. Your pizza shouldn't go without those two. Everything else albeit still fresh and delicious didn't stand out like those two.

I think my pizza could've feed two people. For $10.95 that's amazing value for your buck."}

What is this magic!?

This is Blaze Pizza, friends.

It's fast, fired, fantastically economical and GOOD.

And of course you can split your pizza in half and essentially make two different pies... which I totally did.   

The possibilities are legit endless.  Chicken/bacon/peppers with a buffalo sauce drizzle.  Meatball/ricotta/roasted red peppers/and a sprinkle of oregano.  All veggies.  All meat.  Only cheese.  Gluten free.  You can do just about anything for $10.  

Add another $2 - and you can get a super delicious and refreshing Agua Fresca or lemonade!  The mango fresca is so so so good.  

Between the pizza and the fresca, we left Blaze full and happy.  You've got to give it a try..."}
{"text":"I forgot to rate my last experience... definitely 1 star service and not 4 stars. The ladies here now should be fired!!!"}
{"text":"It's been said that \"every pizza can be a personal pizza if you try hard enough and believe in yourself.\" This is fact. 

At Blaze, you can forget that sharing is caring and order your own personal size pizza for under $10. What I love about this place is that pizzas are fully customizable, or you can opt in for their signature styles. There dozens of toppings and sauces, plus three types of dough: traditional, gluten-free, and high-rise. If you want a \"lighter\" pizza, go with the traditional; it's a thin and has a crunchy crust. The high-rise will no doubt fill you up. After pizzas are made, they're slid into a fiery oven and cooked within minutes. Unlike other pizza shops in town that operate on a similar concept, my pizzas have always been baked to perfection -- never undercooked. 

The ordering process is painless. Despite the occasional long lines, the wait time is short. Hate lines? Place an order online -- too bad they don't deliver."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with my good friend! I love being welcomed every time I walk in the door! 

When going up to the counter, they always talk to you like they've known you forever and it's always nice to lay your problems for the day on a person you don't know! The staff are so friendly and I even know a few people that I went to high school with here! 

As far as the pizza goes, it's delicious! I ordered the \"meat eater\" last night and the gentleman put every meat on there and I was super happy. They ran out of the banana peppers I love though, right when I got to the veggies. Bummer.

Sitting at the high tables was pretty nice because we were away from the children climbing all over the booths. The tables are always clean and I love being able to take my pizza home if I'm not finished!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I had an amazing experience here. Kind of a pizza snob being from New York. Obviously I got to pick out everything I wanted from the style of crust along with unlimited toppings. The reason I'm giving 5 stars and not 4 is because an employee Corey was so patient with me and my daughter for our 1st time. I always give that hard 5th star to great staff. I was planning on going back but he makes wanna make this a once a week date night with my daughter. Thank you blaze and Corey for making our experience amazing."}
{"text":"We got two build your own pizzas with unlimited toppings, two drinks a brownie, and a cookie for under $30. Much better pricing than other places
Minus one star because it was a little burnt at the bottom. Also because when we ordered our desserts, we didn't receive them then and there we had to ask a staff member for them. Not sure if thats the policy but it was rather confusing"}
{"text":"Good pizza, just don't be in any kind of rush. Although, this model is supposed to remind you of Chipotle, the staff here doesn't have that \"get up and go\" that you would typically find at a Chipotle. Honestly, they don't seem to be rushed at all. I realize it's hard to find good help these days, but my experience isn't an isolated one, and maybe the training needs to be refined. I hope they can improve, because the pizza is good and my kids like it. And I'm happy they offer gluten free options for my gluten free child. Although I find it odd that they change gloves and have a separate dough smasher for gluten free, but use the same pesto brush that was used on the gluten crusts. It seems that this is more for show rather than a true concern for cross contamination."}
{"text":"Blaze has opened my eyes to a whole new way of looking at pizza. I've always been a pizza dude, but how about getting a fully customized amazing pizza in about 3 minutes for about $8?
This will be the next big thing in the restaurant industry. 
More than 500 locations will be in the US by 2020, so if you haven't heard or tried Blaze yet, do yourself a favor and get on board. 
Blaze does things the right way--the crust is perfect, there are tons of sauce and topping options, and try the blood orange lemonade!
My only suggestion would be to add basil and other fresh ingredients AFTER the pizza has been fire'd (cooked) rather than before.
LeBron James is a big investor in Blaze, if that means anything to you. I have read that Blaze is the next \"Chipotle\".
Bottom line....excellent pizza at a great price!"}
{"text":"I liked it a lot. Reasonable price pizza that you can customize. Lots of questions and interaction between you and the employees. It is pretty loud but I'm okay with a thin crust pizza joint with a lot of yelling. Someone told me it's a chipotle that serves pizza and I agree. Just hope the ingredients are like chipotle's. The Art pizza is what I ate."}
{"text":"Legit pizza , good toppings, sauces, dough and workers were nice! For sure better then Pizza Rev"}
{"text":"Went here to kill time while we needed to be out of the house.The service was great the kids loved picking thier sauses and toppings . The employees making the pizzas  spoke directly to each family member making my kids feel important . The assembly area was neat and clean all the toppings and veggies looked fresh. Drinks are either bottled or fountian  . The loud relaxed atmosphere makes for a rwlaxed and fun meal for about $10. A person. We will be back"}
{"text":"Can't complain. This is like a subway for pizza. The crust was crispy because it's cooked in a nice pizza oven until perfection. It doesn't take long either. They have a ton of toppings too! I got chicken, spinach, pesto, ricotta, bell peppers, etc. then they have drizzles to put on your pizza at the end. It's a quick lunch stop with a very casual atmosphere! 
Eat on!"}
{"text":"We've been to this place twice. Pizza is great. It's quick and it's cheap. Ingredients are great. There are just a few things I hope that are just kinks that need worked out as they are a new location. I've never been to any other Blaze's so I don't know if this is how they run all of them but here are my concerns. 
When you walk in, it is a little overwhelming, the amount of employees talking to you. There were about 5-6 people in the place and 15 employees to serve us, each eager to put one ingredient on my pizza. It's weird. 
Also I can't really hear the person helping me because of all of the other voices behind them and the music. I am 29 years old with great hearing but the music is too loud, and the speakers are already blown from it being too loud. Along with the amount of employees talking, it's a little distracting while trying to build your own pizza.  
Lastly, there is an employee that walked around three times and asked to take away my pizza or get me a box because I am slow at eating it, and they have nothing to do. Or that's their job but after the first time and the second time, I was a little bothered by the third time. A little silly. It's not their fault though, management doesn't need to have that many employees at one time. I can't imagine they'll be there for very long considering the overhead, and payroll at this rate....And it'd be nice if they did. So hopefully they figure that out."}
{"text":"Great pizzas, friendly staff, really good price. You should give it a try.
Went there first time on Monday and I'm definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their spicy sauce. I love to get a pizza to go and then reheat it at home for my family. So delicious."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! So fast clean and so fresh! I love most of their gourmet pizzaz. They even have half of a pizza with salad as a meal. The white top pizza is delicious a must try."}
{"text":"I first came across Blaze Pizza in Seattle and I must say I am excited to have one now so close to home.

Pizza done subway style!!!!  Make your own and they have same fancy ingredients!  Kalamata olives, whole roasted garlics, spicy red sauce & siracha.  Yummy!!

The lines long but moved fast....I stop at 4 stars as the pizzas are turned over so fast they needed to cook a bit more as the center was soggy and luke warm."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I am vegan and am ALWAYS looking for more places nearby. I especially love that I can preorder online to make the pickup process faster. The pizzas are the perfect size and at an unbelievable price. And, today, for the first time, I tried the mango agua Fresca and is was DELICIOUS!!  If you are vegan....this is a perfect go to pizza place. Plus they have the arugula topper!  Thanks for a quality pizza at a GREAT price!!"}
{"text":"Holy cow. I have died and gone to pizza heaven.  First time. Love it. Will be back  so hot and fresh.  Great pizza"}
{"text":"Quick, fast and hot - and I don't mean my date.  

I've heard a lot of good things about Blaze Pizza from word of mouth.  I even heard that it's NBA superstar Lebron James' favourite pizza place in the whole wide world! Ok, maybe not but I do know that he owns shares in the company so it's no surprise that he would mention it on his Twitter or Instagram.

Anyway, at Blaze for $11.45 you can heavily customize your own pizza with as many toppings as you want at no extra charge.  As the base, they have 3 kinds of sauces like regular tomato sauce to spicy tomato sauce, a few types of cheeses from mozzarella to Parmesan to goat cheeses.   For toppings, there's bacon, pepperoni, italian mild sausages and spicy italian sausages, grilled chicken, ground beef, to name a few.  On the veggies side, there's zucchini, pineapple, mushrooms, arugula, grilled and sauteed onions, etc.  The possibilities are endless.

Once you've settled on your choices of toppings, they put it into a fast firing gas oven that bakes your pizza within 5 minutes.  They don't have slices.  So if you can't or don't finish your pizza, there are small rectangular takeout boxes on the side that you can use bring your leftovers home.  I love the fact that they have a lot of condiments at your disposal to make your pizza taste even better like oregano, sea salt, more parmesan cheese, pepper flakes, etc..  I also like the fact that unlike other major pizza chains, their dough they use is not too thick and not too thin, and just right in the middle for a complete pizzeria experience.  

There is dine in seating and plenty of it. It faces southward towards Yonge/Dundas Square so you can people watch the busy intersection as you scarf down your pizza.  They are in the process of getting their alcohol license as on the menu there is an option for beers as drinks later on.  If you can't decide on what toppings you want or just want a pre-made selection, there are cheaper choices on the menu for the most basic pizza option that costs from $5.45 and up but below the $11.45 standard pizza where you customize it yourself.

I've returned since my first visit and while it's not the best pizza I've had, it currently is a favourite place to go for pizza that I have no qualms about recommending it to others.   There pizza tastes really good, the ingredients are fresh and made to order on the spot, they are generous with the toppings and sauces,  there's hardly a wait, the staff is helpful and friendly, what's there not to like? 

Definitely check this place out on your next trip downtown!"}
{"text":"It's a really nice place.  The pizza has a very good flavor but they should put some more toppings on the pizza.  They put just a few pieces of chicken and less than a 50grs of bacon...  The price is good and the service is really nice..."}
{"text":"You know that QT radio commercial about the guy being a certain percentage of pizza? Well, I think I would be about 95% that lol. I basically live off pizza. Therefor, I was lured in here by a bogo offer that hit my mailbox. how could I decline that! Anywho, wandered in here this past weekend after a late appointment and not wanting to make anything at home. It was about 830 Saturday night when we got there. Now, call me crazy (or an old lady) but to me 830 is late for dinner, even on a weekend. Maybe that's because we start our day at 5am and I am normally in bed by then! For it being 830, the place was packed. I figured this was a good sign. 

Meeh. I will say, the staff was friendly, young kids working the line. However, not efficient. The back up reminded me of my LA driving days. I don't miss that. There was no flow, and it really did take a long time to move through the line. It was clustered, they seemed overwhelmed and rushed. I bit my tongue though, not saying anything nasty. I was tired, hungry, and just ready to sit down and eat with a beer. 

For a picky person such as myself, I love the whole build it yourself idea. That way its exactly to your liking. I did original crust, white sauce, with chicken bacon spinach olives artichoke  tomato and oregano. The portion size was good, for a single person. My son got some type of meat concoction, and was able to have leftovers the next afternoon. 

Overall, it was just okay. I don't know which came first, MOD or this place (I think MOD), but I would choose them over this place, even though this central ave location is closer to me. I would only come back if they had another bogo coupon floating around."}
{"text":"I will start out that there was just a tad bit wait. The beer both on draft and in bottles are to be left desired. I would suggest one or two different draft beers and most certainly different bottled beers. But that is the beer connoisseur in me talking.

Then I will go into how awesome the food tastes.

The ingredients in finishing touches on the pizza here are amazing. Sea salt? Yes please. The pizza was just fired up right. It doesn't feel like a brick in my stomach after consuming. The atmosphere during the week (this is just assuming since this is my first time here) is quite a younger crowd. Now that maybe because high school students are no longer in school. But during the week I would suspect that during lunch hour it is more directed towards a younger crowd and possibly a business crowd. The place is pretty modern with exposed brick and open ceiling concept. I like the vibes here.

I definitely will tell all my friends about this and we'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"Had the kids with us so only got to try the simple cheese and pepperoni pizzas.  There are many things I do like about this place.  Most important is that it does not take long to get your pizzas.  I love thin crust so that was definitely my fav part. But as for the pizzas, I didn't find it to be anything special, especially for the price and the size, but look at where it is located right.   The thing I found kind of weird was that, they do not actually make the pizzas by hand like everywhere else."}
{"text":"Blaze pizza, or Blasè as we like to affectionately call it, offers a unique casual experience with particularly good service and tasty custom made to order food. 

For $7.85 they offer a whole variety of ingredients to make your own pizza with sauce, meats, vegetables, and other toppings. Within a few minutes, your custom pizza is made hot n fresh out the kitchen mama rollin that dough got hungry men in there wishin.

This is all nice and dandy to have hot n ready custom pizza with good ingredients, but what really makes this place stand out is the service. Everyone on the line was very friendly and welcoming, addressing you by your name and making your personal pizza feel exactly that, personal. Even the guy in the dining room was very helpful handing us napkins and cheese and clearing out plates before we even asked. In fact, their surprisingly excellent service brought up this good 4 star experience up to a 5. We were so pleasantly surprised that if you told me before I came that I would give Blaze a 5 star review, I wouldn't believe you. Even as I write this review it feels weird to give this style of restaurant a perfect review, but I still struggle to find fault at a price of $7.85.

This casual dining experience felt more than casual, and for the price and level of service, how can I complain?"}
{"text":"Fast quick Pizza \"subway style\".  My 5 year old son LOVES this place. it's very afforadable for a family to eat lunch or dinner.  The pizza is made to order with all the ingredients you would like for under $8/pizza.  Great franchise and good tasting pizza for the price, convenence and family fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this place waiting for it to open and it finally has! Hubby and I stopped by for dinner a few days ago during the grand opening and a nice girl at the door gave us both BOGO coupons. There were a few tables occupied, but no long line like some of my friends faced when visiting during grand opening week. They have a good amount of tables inside and they also have some tables outside. After looking over the menu and placing my order, I watched the pizza artists work their magic making my pizza and I was impressed with the variety of toppings offered. Pizzas are made in 180 seconds once in the oven and are all $7.65 each plus tax and you can choose from one of their signature pizzas or build your own choosing the cheeses and toppings you like. I ended up liking my pizza a lot and came back for dinner tonight. Service was just as friendly and I again enjoyed my pizza. 

Build Your Own - I chose classic red sauce, shredded mozzarella, ovalini mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms and pineapples. The sauce was good as the toppings. I really liked the thin crust that was chewy yet perfectly crisp.

Art Lover - This is one of their signature pizzas with artichokes, mozzarella, ricotta, chopped garlic and red sauce dollops. The crust was consistent with my previous visit and I again enjoyed my pizza. The only problem with this pizza for me was that I tasted no garlic. It's possible it was forgotten when the pizza was being made, but garlic is a flavor that stands out and it was hiding this time, boo! 

You can get your food to-go like I did and you can also place your order online. I'm a fan and will be back to try other pizza creations :)"}
{"text":"I think the thing that amazes me the most about Blaze is the price point. $10.49 unlimited toppings.  Not just flavourless peppers and woody white tomatoes - fairly premium toppings.  This would be a winner price point if it were good food and took 30 minutes but then they went and made it faster than some burger joints.  The closest thing we've had to pizza that fast is Cocobrooks and they aren't custom and Blaze is STILL faster (and CB are cooking from frozen). 

I don't live by Blaze and only get out here every so often but I've had it a couple times and it's tasty enough to start sneaking back into my mind when I'm eating other pizza (even some of my favourites).   \"That margarita pizza was pretty good but cost $16 when I could have got a Blaze with more tasty toppings for $10.49\"  See,  it's kind of ruining pizza at fancier restaurants. 

Definitely worth a trip, hopefully they are popular enough to open a Blaze by me soon?"}
{"text":"What a great value. Others have covered the basics, I'll just add that you can't go wrong with a pizza YOU created coming piping hot out of the oven. The staff is an efficient group of young people who I have found are eager to please. The place is spotless, too. Download the app, the rewards program is slow to win anything but they load really great specials onto it (buy one, get one, etc)"}
{"text":"The white pizza is the absolute best!!! Staff is mostly nice and with it...can't blame them for having youngsters making the pizzas...as long as they put what I ask for on it, your good!! Usually super busy!! But absolutely worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Blaze last night even though at almost 7pm the line was out the door. It took about 20 minutes to get our three pizzas ordered. Tony had the simple pie for just over 5 bucks. My wife and I had build your own pizzas and two drinks. Our bill was around $20. Everbody loved their pizzas. Tony ate his entire pizza. My wife and I brought home leftovers for lunch the next day. Coke products and lemonades make for a nice beverage selection."}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday and now I have the worst food poisoning I've ever experienced. Might have to go to the ER. I'm really disappointed because I love this place, but I usually go to the Eastern location. Merry Christmas, everyone! Don't eat at this location!"}
{"text":"On a Friday night at 6 pm, expect a wait.  The staff was working people efficiently through the line, but it was still a significant wait time.  
I love the build your own pizza.  The policy with the artichoke hearts are a little ridiculous, though.  I don't order artichoke \"leaves\"- but that's what ends up happening.
The lobby tables were sticky and there was garbage on the floor.  I understand it's busy, but there are some things we shouldn't compromise on.  Pizza is great, though, so we will be back."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend.  My mom and I went for lunch.  The place was cool and clean inside.  We made our own pizzas the way we wanted them.  The price was VERY reasonable and the blood orange lemonade was fantastic!  I have stomach issues and I had no issue with this pizza.  
My only issue was that the pre-made salads looked old.  The lettuce was brown on the edges.  I think this place would do well to make their salads to order.  
The staff was friendly and the food was good.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fast and delicious. I chose to build my own pizza:  thin crust, pesto sauce, spinach, mozzarella, pepperoni, basil, roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, Amazing! Took half home, and reheated it per instructions on website -- perfect! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"AMAZIN
The service is so fast, even during busy lunch times. They put a smiley on your order if you're new and take extra attention into making sure you're satisfied with it.

Built my own pizza with two toppings - Italian sausage and mushroom. Had no idea that for an extra $2 I could get unlimited toppings. They have a HUGE variety of bases, toppings, cheeses, and finishes. You can watch your pizza get cooked in front of your eyes, v fresh n delicious"}
{"text":"Of all the chain pizzerias I have to go with Blaze! Although Uncle Maddio's is one of our favorites, Blaze beats them out with a few extras! 

For starters their crust is delicious and their sauce options are excellent, especially the garlic pesto! They have a wide variety of cheeses and protein toppings and don't forget to add some sea salt to your pizza, it's an perfect finishing touch. 

The service is fast and friendly and they offer military discounts. They also have a nice outdoor seating area and parking is decent. It's also a great area to walk after you eat with some nice dessert options nearby. 

Blaze is some good pizza!"}
{"text":"I liked being able to make my own custom pizza. The staff are really friendly"}
{"text":"Blaze has been a weekly visit for me since it opened. I can order a pizza with any toppings for around $8. Perfect price point to include in my lunch rotation!

The pizza is good and I can get something different every time I go. Your choice of thin crust or a thicker crust for a small fee. 

Ask for the course salt and pepper at the end of the line. 

One of my favorites is the traditional red sauce on thin crust with mozzarella, gorgonzola, tomato, spinach, red onion, roasted garlic.

Get the blood orange lemonade; that is some good stuff! Pairs perfectly with the pizza"}
{"text":"I waited until after their free pizza day to try this place for two reasons. First, I expected better quality when they were not slammed. Second, less than $8 for all the toppings I wanted was worth it not to stand in that humongous line (I actually drove by on the way to somewhere else and at an off-peak time, the line was still waaaay down the block). Oh yeah, that's right...sub-$8 for all the topping you want!
They have a menu with a few signature pizzas. But don't let that limit your creativity. Because for the exact same price they list all of their sauces and toppings. And they have a lot of options including goat cheese, grilled chicken and a lot I wouldn't eat but you might. Basically, you'll be able to make a solid pizza no matter your preferences.

One thing that sets this place apart from another chain with a similar model is they put the pizzas in a fire oven. Now, this is good and bad. I personally like crust that is cooked this way but there is risk, especially when they have a bunch of pizzas in there, and that is the form of burnt edges. I'd say that 50% of the edges on my pizza were blackened and thus uneatable.  

I also tried their signature s'more pie since I was giving this place an honest shot. It was actually really good. Not something I'd probably order for myself again because I didn't \"need\" it, but I'd recommend giving it taste.  

Overall, worth a return visit and much better quality for a $1-2 more than the big chains."}
{"text":"We were disappointed with the flavors in the veggies and chicken bbq pizza. It is a concierge location but just not to our satisfaction of taste."}
{"text":"Tried blaze pizza for the first time. They have excellent customer service. There was a manager that greeted me and my family as we entered. He explained the menu options and how to order. The best bet is to build your own because it's one prize just under $8 for as many toppings you like. I ordered classic red sauce with mozzarella and ricotta cheese with salami, bacon, mushrooms, artichoke, and oregano. They cooked it right away and the taste and flavor exceeding my expectations. This place knows how to make pizza and it tastes flavorful. The pizzas have about six slices. I really enjoyed the blood orange lemonade they served. I will definitely be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to change my rating, but our pizza was soggy this time!  It was still good, but I don't like soggy pizza's."}
{"text":"Easy ordering and pickup if you are in the area. Pizza was good for thin crust. Specialty combinations were tasty."}
{"text":"Disappointed with service and management at this store, employees don't show any level of interest unless you're a twenty something young girl,

Had a similar experience a few weeks ago but decided to give it a second try,  unfortunately the same outcome,  ordered 2 pizzas on line one finished right on time the other took 20 minutes more, no explanation, no hey apologies, nothing....

Bad culture, no management, or quality control, don t plan on returning. It's too bad, their food can be good, missed potential"}
{"text":"This place is damn good people. I was pretty sceptical cause of the touristy area and how quickly they did em but it was so yummy. Great service.  We had a bum salad (some rotten lettuce but not a big deal) and the manager came over, apologized and gave us a free pie for next time. Now that's class. 

Partner had the herb all veggie (she loved it) and had a plain pepperoni.  Tasty sauce and crunchy thin crust. 

Will definitely return and not just for the free pie. :)"}
{"text":"Great deal for National Pi Day! Thanks Blaze! As always fresh ingredients with exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Ordered on line and picked it up at the store.  When I got home and bit into it I was hit with a clove of garlic (which I cannot eat).  I then called the restaurant and asked them if all of their pizzas come with garlic, I was told that only if you order it.  Needles to say, I did not order garlic.  I just ordered pepperoni and sausage.  The individual then told me I could bring the pizza back and he would make me a new one.  While I appreciated the offer, I was in no mood to drive back down there and pick up another pizza.  I would have much rather had a credit on my next order instead,  I guess that option was not available.

Needless to say, the pizza was not anything special.  I'll pass!"}
{"text":"For a chain, this is the best pizza I have ever had (let me preface that I like thin crust!). You can taste the freshness in the ingredients and the cheeriness and love of the staff here. Oh and they make the pizza super fast - yet with all the greatness of a brick oven.

Given the ambiance of the decor and the higher quality furniture than most fast casual places, you'll think you are in a modern neighborhood restaurant. Oh and it is right near a light rail stop - perfectly easy to get to!"}
{"text":"I must admit,im a huge fan of this place,I mean build  your own pizza is very brilliant!!The pizza I  build was so amazing and full of flavor everything tasted fresh,I most definitely will be back again..:-)"}
{"text":"Just an awesome concept with really great pizza. You get in line, choose your dough and everything you want on it. Very good value for money and high quality. Love this place."}
{"text":"Just a great and simple concept that always delivers the perfect personal pizza. Tips: don't over do the toppings, less is more, and the spicy red sauce is the ish  If you haven't tried Blaze yet you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Really great individual fast fired pizzas for under $9. 
You can pick whatever and how much toppings you would like on your pizza. Custom made from the crust to the sauce and the toppings. It's usually more than I can eat but my husband can just about eat a whole pizza by himself. It's a favorite when we want a pizza for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Build your own fantastic tasting pizza.  I agree they are Blazing fast.  They are super nice, fast and tasty.  Must try."}
{"text":"What a great concept!! Great product and cooking. Quality Ingredients. ( Artichoke hearts!?!) Ash is a great Hostess also.  Second time this week visiting.  Thanks for coming to Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Better than Fired Pie in my opinion!  More of a selection of toppings and I love that they have olive oil or balsamic glaze to drizzle on the pizza after it's cooked."}
{"text":"What a great concept! This place is inexpensive and is flexible you get what you want how you want it.  They understand gluten allergies and you love changes for every gluten-free pizza they have a standardize policy and even use a separate cutter for gluten-free pizzas.  It is super fast and is a very good pizza inexpensively.  We would definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"the pizza was delicious! The drinks were so good the lemonades were different I loved them! BUT It would be 5 star of it wasn't for the people taking the order and making my pizza.... They made me feel uncomfortable .. They would look at me whisper to each other and laugh, it seemed like they were talking about me (felt like high school)  which made me want to leave ASAP. they need to learn to be friendlier!!"}
{"text":"With the build your own pizza concept I was a unsure of this concept at first. I decided to give it a try and it wasn't to bad. I like that fact that they have several varieties of sauces, cheeses, meats and vegetables some chain pizza doesn't offer. The fresh mozzarella and the ricotta alone were a welcomed surprise along with the fresh basil, simple ingredients but a staple for my pizzas. 
Building your pizza within a few minutes and only baking in the oven for a few more makes this a quick and satisfying meal. keep that in mind because even if there is a longer line it doesn't take that long once you get to start your order."}
{"text":"Totally a fan of Blaze! What's great about this set up is that its easy to navigate the ordering process(choose one of their signature pies or create your own) Price point is very reasonable,
and portions are perfect.

I went with their signature White Top Pizza and for dessert, we tried their S'mores Pie which is basically a cookie sandwich, but a pretty damn good one! Have them set it by the oven so it gets all warm and gooey(bet you want one now, huh?) My pizza was good, but I still prefer a white pizza without using alfredo sauce...S'mores Pie was a pefect ending, and it was great that the staff continually checked on all guests and even bussed a few tables.

Quick, efficient, tasty, and doesn't break the bank at all...its also a great option if you have a bunch of kids in tow. ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Very tasty food. Friendly service. Great prices. So much variety and and great atmosphere. I thought for sure there was no way we would each finish our pizzas but they were so good we couldn't stop! #NoRegerts"}
{"text":"Ok... So on the positive side... Its real close to my house... And its pizza.   

So lets really talk... Signiture pizza...   Meaning what we do best... A tried and true recipe that they want to be known for.  I can't wait... I love trying new things... I choose a pizza from the name and description... Ready to go... Nope!

Now come questions..
Do you want cheese? Does it come with cheese?  It reads cheese in the description... Oh yea, just some people want other things.

Would you like salt?
dude is that how you make the signature pizza?
well sometimes people want different stuff...
Dude just make it how its made... Nothing more nothing less

(end if the line now) 
So do you want anything else on it?
oh man... Does anything else come on it?

you get where this is going.

So its ALL upsell... Only good to build your own... And the crust is like a saltine cracker... 

I was really hoping for something like 800 degrees but closer... Their white pizza is one of the best ever pizzas I've tried... Also their signature... Except without the upsell questions... Also better dough and fresh mozzarella... Not grated market stuff.

With so much competition in the area and in vegas... Skip it... 

I hope it closes so that nobody else gets fooled into thinking its good, just because its close.

Its the subway of pizza places

{"text":"all I knew about Blaze pizza going in was 1. Lebron was a founding investor and 2. it's like chipotle but for pizza. that's really all I needed to know to give it a try.

Went around lunchtime a little past noon, and of course, like any place downtown, there was a line. But from end to end, I think it probably took about 15 mins total, which isn't too bad considering you're getting a freshly, custom made pizza.

I opted to build my own pizza, which proves that when left to my own devices, I tend to go overboard with my food. I loaded it up with 2 types of cheeses (mozzerlla and gorgonzola), 4 meats (bacon, italian sausage, italian meatball, and chicken), and a ton of veggies.

maybe 5 mins after ordering and paying, I got my freshly made frankenstein of a pizza. verdict? It was hot, delicious, and probably because I loaded it up with so much meat, quite filling. All for $11.

Next time I might show a little more constraint, but what's great about Blaze pizza, that it gives you the option not to. it comes out fast, there are alot of choices for toppings, and it offers another option for those who want something other than a burrito or a burger. definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. chalk up another win for Lebron."}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza is amaze-balls. 

It was my first time going, and the employee was really nice. She knew it was my first time, so she helped me with the menu as well as putting a smiley face on the pizza box just to enhance my experience. I got a Build-Your-Own Pizza and it was delicious. I loved it and would definitely come back and recommend all pizza enthusiasts to come here! The place is also very convenient because it's in the heart of downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and I never had one bad experience yet, this is the best place to go if you want your own personalized pizza freshly made in front of you."}
{"text":"What a great idea, it's basically a Subway but for pizza.  The pizza itself is decently sized, thin crust and crispy but the best part is the selection of toppings, which you can get as many as you want. It only takes a few minutes to cook it so you won't have to wait around too long.  

The employees were very friendly and helpful as well, will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Decided to check out Blaze before a movie on Friday and I'm so glad we did! Service was friendly and fast, and the pizza was delicious!

For $10.45 you can build your own pizza with unlimited toppings, which is amazing because they have so many options to choose from. I opted for like seven veggie selections with a sprinkle of feta and a drizzle of pesto and it was amazing. The pizza crust was thin and crispy just the way I like it. It was also a pretty big pie. I didn't think I'd be able to eat it all in one sitting, but I did and I am not even ashamed. 

A previous yelper mentioned that there were no crust options but I'm pretty sure there was a gluten-free crust available when we there. 

You can also add fresh arugula at the end! Next time I will totally do that, and in the words of Def Leppard, there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"When I realized this location was opening I was so excited , as this is close to home. Unfortunately last night I was disappointed. 

I came in and the line was the typical Blaze line, but there were several things happening where you could tell they were really overwhelmed and underprepared for the busy Concord Mills area. 

They were pressed to get fresh dough formed, the toppings were being refilled slowly and there was only one register open. The team member managing the oven was being ignored and there were a couple people behind the counter who didn't seem to know what to do , and needed a lot of direction . 

After a long wait I was told my pizza needed to be 're-fired' because it stayed in the oven too long . I waited some more time and saw a pizza come out of the oven that looked what I had ordered and be placed on the cooking rack. 

Then I stood there and watched several other pizzas come out and get sliced and served to customers. When I mentioned I think I saw my pizza sitting there, I was told \" I have no way of knowing that's your pizza.\"

After waiting a few more minutes , and watching others get served their pizzas ( some of which were also re-fires) , they figured out that that pizza was mine, and gave it to me. A cold pizza. 

So I give this location one star because it is conveniently located near a lot other things, but I will say this shopping center does not have enough parking for all that's going on. 

I might give this location a try in a couple of months and maybe order online or come in the middle of the day, but after my experience last night, I would say to go back soon is not worth it because they are so 'new' and haven't nailed down their process."}
{"text":"When I can't make up my mind on what I eat, pizza often ends up being I finally decide to go for. You can't go wrong with pizza and you can't go wrong with Blaze . Blaze is build your own pizza place, you begin on one end where an attendee lets you select your dough and sauce , and work your way to the register as you create your own masterpiece. I recommend trying one of their recommendations so that you can discover the possibilities. I also recommend trying one of their fresh made juices( worth the extra $). Indoor and outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"I was so excited Blaze came to University City, and even more excited I was able to get a better look at the business with Yelp. I usually get a basic pepperoni pizza with red sauce , mozzarella and parmesan cheese , which is so good I don't even try anything else, yet Blaze has so much more to offer. Know that the dough is made fresh daily. The meat toppings are nitrate free, and free of other additives and preservatives. Blaze is a place where there is something for everyone , especially the health conscious . This location is conveniently located in the boardwalk area of University City and is definitely a place you should visit."}
{"text":"Rude disorganized staff. Handed food to people before me that were in line behind me. Pizza was cold"}
{"text":"UPDATE: 1/19/17

After I left my original review, I was contacted by the management of Blaze. They offer their apology for the service and invited us back to try their food again. We excepted their offer, and have since been back twice. The first time, it was much less busy and we didn't have any problems ordering, however, my pizza was extremely well done around the edges and I wasn't too pleased. That being said, the next time we went back, the pizza was absolutely perfect, but this time we had a little trouble during the ordering process similar to the kind mentioned in my original review. The more times we go here, the more I get to observe the workers and I realize a lot of what throws off the service is the number of online orders they've gotten in. The restaurant may look empty but there may be 15 online orders or vice versa. So, while the food is good, I still have to say that the service is somewhat inconsistent. They employees are very nice for the most part, but you have to keep an eye on them or they tend to get distracted and make mistakes. However, That is a small price to pay for the deliciousness of their pizza.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
We went here for dinner last night because we just recently moved nearby. We love other Blaze locations and we're excited to try this one out. Unfortunately we had a terrible experience and I think we'll stick to the Henderson location.

While we were going through the line to order, the staff was in complete chaos. They kept switching back and forth between roles and as a result the line was at a standstill. The staff kept sliding my pizza along the counter before I actually got to the point where I could see what ingredients I wanted on it. At that point the staff switched roles again and the guy that came to take over put my pizza on the rack to go in the oven with nothing but ham on it. I hadn't even gotten to the veggies yet. When I told him I wasn't done yet, he rolled his eyes and asked what else I wanted. I told him I literally couldn't see because the line was so long I was stuck back by the cheeses. Cue another eye roll.

Eventually we finally got the pizza straightened out and we moved onto the cashier. I told her I wanted to use my Blaze membership and she told me to bring it up. I scanned it but nothing seemed to happen. I asked her if it worked and she said yes, to refresh my app and it would show up. She was clearly in a hurry and didn't care so I had my doubts but I went along with it. She then tried to rushed us off before she remembered to get our drink. When we reminded her, she seemed annoyed I would dare ask for the drink I paid for.

So I go try to find a place to sit down. There are about four empty tables, three of which are dirty. I find the last clean table and sit down to refresh the app. Lo and behold, the scan didn't work (just as I'd thought) but once again I shrugged it off.

The last straw came with our pizza. When my pizza came out it was absolutely smothered in pesto. Luckily I like pesto, but more importantly, I didn't ask for it. But when I bit into it, it was barely cooked. At this point I was so mad, I just wanted to leave. I knew if I asked the staff to fix it, I would just get more attitude or annoyance from them so we just left. Date night = ruined. Like I said, we won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"We were pretty impressed. They were cheap, pretty quick, and unlike a lot of these places the pizza wasn't soggy or cold. They did seem a bit disorganized in back. We had to repeat ourselves quite a bit and clarify our order quite a few times but it all worked out in the end."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place gets so many rave reviews. Maybe I got a wrong pizza? I had \"Red vine\" from the menu and it was the saddest pizza I've ever seen. I wish I took a photo but forgot. There were only a few cherry tomatoes and probably a few mozzarella cheese on it. It wasn't worth waiting in line for over a half hour."}
{"text":"This place is always great and the food is spectacular. I will be back and do recommend them"}
{"text":"Usually a very nice and friendly place. Good pizza, reasonable price but recently they did false advertising and never honored it. Got an email about 4 pizzas for $4 after 4pm on 4th October. Called the location near my house to see if this was true or had some sort of twist.Nobody picked up the phone for half an hour. Decided to go there anyways. Turns out it was a promotion just for U.S customers. My question is why are we getting the emails in Canada if this was for U.S only? Place was packed because every loyal customer like me got the email and was pissed to know that they wouldn't even honor the deal for their local and loyal customers. I left without a pizza and so did many others.But the hungry ones or the ones with kids decided to dine anyway. I am sure you guys made good money that day but trust me that you lost a lot of Loyal Customers. Never coming back to your location. Shame on your business practices."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite! Lot of options and even though it's super fast it's actually good pizza! Helpful, sweet staff too!"}
{"text":"I love that they have gluten free pizza. Fast and easy. I just wish they put more cheese on the pizza, what you order to go you dont have much control over adding more. Over all, ill be back."}
{"text":"False advertising. They say $5 ANY PIZZA ANY TOPPINGS with purchase of drink Monday's before 5PM. So I ordered what I assumed would be considered ANY PIZZA and a drink. I get to the register and my total is $10.05. I'm sorry, Blaze Pizza, but are your 16oz fountain drinks roughly $5 or did I not order ANY PIZZA? I paid without fuss and wasn't given a receipt or even offered one so I requested one and the cashier had to perform rocket science on another register as I waited patiently for my receipt. Apparently I did not, in fact, order ANY PIZZA. There is normally a $2 upcharge for thicker crust, which was truly not that thick. But this wasn't a normal pizza, right? This was ANY PIZZA. Is crust not considered part of a pizza? Should I have requested my pizza with no crust to be eligible for the $5 ANY PIZZA with purchase of drink Monday's before 5PM deal??? I am just so perplexed. Other than being lied to, misled, and under informed, my dining experience was typical of any BYO pizza place. Would not recommend and will not be going back. There are plenty of other businesses that don't lie to their patrons that do the same thing the same way, if not better."}
{"text":"We got the meat eater and build your own pizza, which was basically the white top with a few extra ingredients. The whole process is extremely quick and it doesn't take long for the pizzas to cook. We really enjoyed the food!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this new pizzeria after reading rave reviews on Yelp.  It seems like more of these quick serve pizza places are popping up around the city, and I was anxious to see how it compared to others I've tried.

The employee who greeted us was very friendly and helpful - she went through the menu options in detail.  You can choose from 9 signature pizzas or you can build your own.  My friend and I decided to split 2 of their signature pizzas: the art lover (artichokes, mozzarella, ricotta, chopped garlic, red sauce dollops; I also added caramelized onion) and the red vine (ovalini mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, parmesan, basil, red sauce, olive oil drizzle).  As the name of this restaurant promises, our pizzas were ready really quickly.  I enjoyed the art lover pizza.  It was different to have a pizza that has sauce dollops rather than sauce on the entire pizza - it was a nice change.  The ricotta was delicious!

The red vine was just ok.  I feel like it could have been better with more cheese; it was a tad too tomato-y.

Overall, good pizza for a great price (only $10.95!).  It's a good pizza option if you're in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with throwing all the toppings on top, it's always good no matter which combination haha"}
{"text":"Did an online order and it was ready in time, exactly what I ordered, and so delicious. I didn't think the trifecta could exist in Charlotte. Just ate my leftovers for breakfast because I was already craving it again!!"}
{"text":"Everything was fresh!!! And what a bargain! Build your own pizza with unlimited toppings! They have a quick line to get your pizza to you and it cooks so fast!!! It's a good system! We all (3 of us) had our own pizzas and drinks for under $35! Couldn't finish it all! It's an awesome way to try new things on your pizza. The staff are friendly and greet you as you come in the door! Too much good things to say. And the sausage is amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"\"Build your own\" pizza is by far worth every penny for $8.25. You pick your dough, sauce type (red, spicy red, or white) and then select from AS MANY toppings as you'd like including every meat if you wanted!

Cheeses: Shredded mozzarella, fresh mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, vegan cheese, feta..etc

Sauce: red sauce, spicy red sauce, green pesto, or white cream sauce. (i recommend adding the green pesto on the crust...sooo good and don't worry it's an option on the menu). 

Meats: Turkey meatballs, pepperoni, chicken, sausage, vegan meat options, salami, ham ...etc

Veggies: Spinach, Basil, bell peppers, garlic, roasted whole garlic, tomatoes, squash (seasonal item), zucchini, black olive, kalamata olives, jalapenos, artichoke, peppercinis, mushrooms, pineapple and red onion.

FINISHES: MUST TRY! Once your pizza is done and you're called up they have finishing sauces... they're so good. I recommend the balsamic glaze and pesto sauce AND some fresh arugula to top it off.

Service: i return to the same location each time because i really like the service provided. The employee's are really nice, i've never felt like a burden ordering a million toppings and they're all genuinely kind. I also love that i can actually hear them over the glass when ordering too! I'll have to add some name later because they're awesome and at any hour of the day. This location is also really clean. I've never seen any napkins or trash on the floor and soda area is always dry. 

Dessert: The smores cookie is so good and they're even bake it for you in the brick pizza oven!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the pizza and atmosphere here.  It's much better than the North Las Vegas Piology.  The high ceilings gave us less claustrophobia.  Everyons pizza was great and not burnt as we have received elsewhere.  Only thing missing was some TVs to watch some sports on.  Will definitely be back with more of the family!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, the other day for a late lunch with a friend and it was damn good pizza. 

It's kind of like One Pizza on King St East if ya ever been. 

You make your order at the front; either one of the signature pies, or you choose your own (unlimited!) toppings. They also have the calories of each topping/signature pies just for your own reference (didn't stop me from putting everything I loved on my pizza ) . You also have the option of whole wheat or gluten free (+ $4).

I made my own and put almost everything (the amazing girl helping me was totally not judging at all, or made it seem like she wasn't anyways). Came up to still under $12. 

If you do decide to overload things WILL fall off. That being said, most of it fell into my mouth  so I was a happy duck. It was a really great pizza though, they know exactly how to cook it and for how long depending on how much/what you have. 

Definitely would come here again though for the diy food, location and service!"}
{"text":"Went there before work, fresh fast and amazing! Simply the best fast food pizza possible!"}
{"text":"As it should be straight forward service no hassle. Easy to navigate menu. Clean and simple staff ready ro add toppings to tour crust. Love the urban interior and friendly people. Had my pizza with tomato sauce, extra mozzerela cheese, spinach, chicken, and as sundried tomatoes."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the made to order build your own pizza. Lots of variety and healthy options! Atmosphere is very retro and has great energy. The staff was very friendly and attentive! I will be returning for another experience..."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised to see this joint make it all the way up here from down south (way down south -- Miami). I guess with the NBA All Star festivities being here this coming year, it is only fitting that King James should pounce on this opportunity to setup a shop here.

I can totally see the appeal here; fast, affordable, freshly made to order pizza that is quite good. For around $10+taxes and whatnot, you get a personal size pizza with as many toppings as you like. You can also pick from one of the special creations they have if you really don't want to be bothered.

The pizza is made to order and served pipping hot in less than 10 minutes from their fire oven. The crust is thin and light and slightly crispy; a pretty good crust. The toppings are fresh and they do the job. Nothing here is going to blow your mind but pizza is....well pizza.

Definitely a great place for a fresh, fast and cheap bite if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Bomb.com! 
This pizza is amazing! But the experience overall was awesome!! I looooove the customer service! They have a great staff!"}
{"text":"Out of all the pizza places kinda like blaze pizza, blaze is definitely my favorite. Everything is sooo good, and 1 pizza is the perfect size. I always get the green stripe when I come here you feel like you are eating healthy even tho you are eating pizza. The staff is always friendly. And the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"This place is fire. All pizzas are $10.45 plus tax and you can choose all the toppings you want. One pizza is just smaller than a regular medium sized pizza and a solid meal. The staff work quickly and are friendly."}
{"text":"The service and Pizza was awesome! Unlimited toppings when I created my own thin crust pizza. And.. it only took 3 mins to bake! Cute restaurant. Will definitely return. 





Best 3 minute pizza ever! We took our children here and they LOVE it! They've got a quick and very friendly staff. Johnny was extremely nice and had no problem making sure we wee enjoying our experience. He even went out of his way to help us while he was on his break."}
{"text":"who doesn't love an amazingggggggg hot outta the stove pizza thats QUICK!
Fantastic variety of selections and amazing atmosphere. It's great because it's in the heart of yonge and dundas. If you're ever downtown, this is a must check out joint. Not your average pizza pizza or pizza hut type of place. 
Price- Average
Very busy during evenings and weekends."}
{"text":"I've only had the opportunity to go once, but if I'm in Charlotte again, I'm definitely going back! The staff was super friendly (greeted me by name and genuinely seemed excited to be there) and the pizza was delicious - you could tell all of the toppings were high quality and super fresh. I ordered one of the pre-designed pizzas and wanted to get additional toppings; low and behold, the guy taking my order let me know that any extra ones are at no additional cost. This is definitely rare, so it was nice to know that having my pizza \"my way\" wasn't going to cost an arm and a leg! For anyone who loves good food, this is the new place to try (and try you will because they have so many delicious menu items)!"}
{"text":"I have never had such yummy pizza until I came here and I'm so glad I did 'cause it's going to be my new go-to place if I'm in the area or if I feel like having some pizza. 

My boyfriend showed me this place months ago and I've been wanting to come for quite some time. Finally did and couldn't be happier. Upon entering, they asked if we've ever been here before and we said no. The lady behind the counter the explained the process although she did talk quite fast lol. 

My boyfriend and I opted for the BYOP option where we chose our own base, sauxe, cheese and toppings. It's quite similar to Subways where you get to choose what toppings you want. There were so many options to choose from it for a little overwhelming lol but luckily they had the signs for what was what and I just read that instead. After everything was built, they put it into a fire oven (?) for 180 second and viola, it's ready to eat. I appreciate that they also trim off the slightly burnt parts of the crust! It was soooooo crispy. 

I also got their lemonade. There was 4 flavours available (strawberry, Mango, blood-orange, and original). To be honest it didn't quite taste like lemonade...it was more of a water-down yet refreshing type of drink. It's also refillable so that's good. 

In total it costed about $15...a tad pricey but the unlimited toppings make up for it."}
{"text":"Great pizza. reasonable prices, build your own pizza, ready in minutes. standard drinks, and some kind of smore thing they ask if you want for desert when you make it to the register. I would have one suggestion for the company. Turn up the temp. I have been to Blaze about 6-7 times and they keep this place at 60 degrees!!!"}
{"text":"Like to go to Blaze Pizza because of pizzas are great and inexpensive. Today my experience was unpleasant. A customer comes in holding her small dog walking all over the restaurant. The person making the pizzas did not ask the woman to leave with her dog, and let her continue to walk around the WHOLE restaurant carrying around her dog, passing behind me at least four times. The woman was going on and on and on about how her dog was hypoallergenic. I don't care if your dog is hypoallergenic, I don't want any dog hair near my food. I'm very disappointed at the restaurant staff to not ask this lady to take her dog outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Menu: http://www.blazepizza.com/menu/

What we had: Meat eater pizza, BBQ chicken pizza

Taste: 7/10

Meat eater pizza was delicious, thin crust, fresh toppings, and not too much sauce. The BBQ chicken pizza was a little bit dry, as it didn't come with any tomato sauce, but was otherwise pretty tasty.

As it was our first time there, we went with the presets.  However, next time, we will definitely be getting custom made pizzas (we didn't know you can get unlimited toppings for the same price)

Value: 8/10

$10 per personal sized pizza (preset and custom made)

**Average cost per diner: $12 after tax and tip 

Service/Convenience: 9/10

The location we went to was at Yonge and Dundas, it was very easy to find, right at the NE corner.  We went around 8pm during a week day, and there was practically no line-up.  The overall ordering process took less than a minute, and the pizza was ready to eat within 5 minutes.

Would go back? Definitely, next time we're in the area and craving a pizza.

Would recommend to friend? Yes, especially if you're a pizza lover.

Similar places: None that we know of.

**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza"}
{"text":"If you're looking for Poor service with poor food quality, then welcome! Overpriced too.  Fired pie is a much better experience ?"}
{"text":"I had walked past this place several times and thought I'd give it a try.  This is the chipotle style build your own pizza type place.  I had been to a similar place in the US (Called Pieology).  

Walked in and thankfully was able to walk right up and start the ordering process.  You pick your dough first, then sauces, cheeses, meats, and other toppings (in that order).  The young guy helping to make my pizza was very pleasant and helpful.  Although I got the sense that he is used to helping out a much younger crowd as there were several times he asked me if that was all I needed.  

Once the pizza is made to my specifications, I paid and I was told it would only be 3 minutes to cook.  So, I waited for my pizza to cook.  The place is very utilitarian, and metal stools for high top tables and some other regular tables.  There is nothing cozy about this place.  

Definitely more than 3 minutes passed and at about the 10 minute mark I decided to go back up to the counter.  My Pizza had just come out of the oven and was ready to be sliced.  They also have some additional garnishes once your pizza is done, (ie: Olive oil, BBQ sauce, etc)  I opted to pass on those  

I took the pizza back to my table and it was good.  Fresh ingredients, and piping hot.  I had gone for the regular sauce (not the spicy sauce) and there was a good tang and a bit of heat to it as well.  The thin crust was very good and it was cooked exactly right.  

Overall, the pizza is good (for a build your own), and the staff seemed very friendly.  The place is quite loud as there are no soft surfaces (other than the humans and the pizza).  The place could be a bit cleaner (ie: tables being wiped & trash can needing to be emptied).  It's a good place to get a relatively inexpensive custom pizza, and it's quick.  I'll go back as I like to get something quick and then keep moving."}
{"text":"It's not as good as the eastern location but very good to say the least. Very friendly staff and wait time in minimal, but I think the oven doesn't cook as well as the other 2 locations. Overall I would highly recommend this place just for the freshness of the ingredients"}
{"text":"First time here, staff wasn't friendly . They say what they have to say and just stare at you with a very annoyed look. As the young girl was making my pizza she was adding peppers and I didn't want any so I said \"oh no I don't want that I'm so sorry\" and she removed them with the most annoyed look ever. I work in customer service and when someone annoys me I smile and pretend that didn't affect me at all. Pizza was great, although friend asked for no arugula she got it anyway"}
{"text":"Love this place as long as Brittney and Megan are working they will get my business all the time. These girls are amazing"}
{"text":"Move over pizza pizza, there's a new pizza joint in town. With all the customizable subs, burrito bowls, sushi burritos, it's only makes sense for there to be customized pizzas. They have a build your own pizza option where you get unlimited toppings. If you can't decide between pesto or tomato sauce, why not have both- half tomato half pesto. They have enough cheese options to satisfy any cheese lover and of course veggies to make it a more balanced meal. They even have a gluten free crust for those with a gluten allergy. The service is quite fast. It's around $11 for a pizza and it's definitely big enough for one, might even have leftovers for the next day (next day cold pizza is the best!). They also have an app that offers redeemable coupons if you think you'll be coming back. It got pretty busy by the time we left at around 6:40 on a Friday night so be prepared to wait in line."}
{"text":"Soooo good...the customer service was awesome, definitely will be back!!!! I never eat all of anything, and I don't, but I almost ate all of my pizza. The pesto sauce, fresh garlic...yummmmmnn"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. Best gluten free crust ever. Easily reheated and taste just as good as when first made. Better than pieology"}
{"text":"So I heard so many great things about this restaurant so I had to come check it out. It was a long line and plenty of ppl seated outside(which is always a good sign). Only waited a few minutes to put in my order. so I ordered a high rise create your own. Had to wait a few more minutes for that to be made since it's more layers. I got sauce, mozzarella, chicken, feta, garlic, artichoke hearts and spinach. It looked great. 

Paid for me and my brother. He got the bbq chicken with pineapples and it also looked great. So he got his pizza after awhile. They were busy so I knew it would be a wait to make our pizzas. My brother got his pizza and I waited for while and figured I had a longer wait since I ordered a high rise. 

Anyway I go to the counter and inquire about my pizza. He looked around and said I know what happened to your pizza. He spoke with a guy who was picking things off of MY pizza. I said how did he get my pizza is his name Dee. The guy behind the counter told the other worker I said her name. I said excuse me are you saying it's my fault my pizza was given to someone else?! He didn't pay me any attention after that. 

I just asked for a refund the cashier acted as if I was wrong for asking for a refund. She said can we make you another one I'm sorry. I said no I'll just get a refund. She called her manager. We waited for him to come and he asked can we make you another one? By now I'm hungry and over it. I said ok whatever. I had to wait for him to make another high rise. By now my brother is almost done eating. 

He makes my pizza and I was so irritated I forgot to get chicken on it since I paid for that. I didn't realize it until it was too late. It was my fault  so I didn't ask for it to be added. He told the guy making the pizza to make it on the fly. I waited a few more minutes. 

By now we have to leave because we were going to the movies. I ask for it to go. I get in the car to take a bite and it was chewy and the dough wasn't all the way done. I was so pissed I threw it in the trash as soon as I got to the movies. I was so pissed off I could scream. 

I was about to call and go off but I let it go. I woke up this morning and said I need to write a review. We wasted our time and money going there. My brother said his pizza was just ok and probably won't be back. On the bright side the only reason I'm giving them a 2 is because the location is awesome and the lemonade was good. I should have got a refill before I left since I waited so long for subpar/undercooked pizza. 

Oh well...I end up having movie pizza. Talk about disappointed. Wish they gave me a refund like I asked for to begin with but I went along with the manager when he came and said lets remake it for you."}
{"text":"The lunch shift here is great. These guys are on a mission to deliver great customer service and product! I just picked up my online order. They're organized, hard working and friendly to top it all off. The pizza is always great too! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Upgraded to 5 stars, because Blaze Pizza is kickass.

Their Pi Day special $3.14 for a whole pizza (regularly $10.49). 

A very happy Pi day indeed :)"}
{"text":"Good pizza.  It is cooked in about 5 minutes and you just tell them what you want on it.  Good pricing.  Only negative is that they tend to be a little light on the toppings, especially the meat, so you have to tell them to add more."}
{"text":"Great pizza, have been there twice now. The reason it is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the noise level, but realistically it is about a 4.5. The staff was very friendly, and even though the food is fast it was cooked properly and tasted fresh, all 4 pizzas we have had there have been exceptionally tasty for a \"faster\" food restaurant. The price is right and if you want a good meal in just a couple minutes I strongly recommend. Way better than dominoes and even cheaper, so there's no excuse not to try it."}
{"text":"I loved it!! Service was very fast even though there was a lot of people. I didn't feel judged when I got like a mountain of cheese on my pizza.

The pizza was done so quickly that I didn't even feel like I waited long. It was delicious!!!

The people working there were also very nice!!"}
{"text":"Customizable pizza in 3 minutes!  I've tried a handful of the signature pizzas - all really good if you don't want to think about what to put on your pizza.  Even though they're signature pizzas, you can substitute, add/remove things from them as well.  

The staff are amazing.  Enthusiastic, friendly and really helpful.  

It's recommended that you have 7-8 toppings max for a crispy pizza.  However, if you have no problem eating your pizza with a fork and a knife, who cares!  You're paying the same price anyway.   

I've had the beet and goat cheese salad.  I ended up not eating it the day I ordered it.  It was still good for lunch the next day.  Not too much dressing and the ratio of ingredients tasted good.  

The smore cookie dessert is good cold, but you gotta have it warmed up.  I'm not a big smore fan regularly, but this is amazing!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visited Blaze for the first time yesterday . It was amazing from start to finish !!!! We walked in and were serviced immediately . The greeter explained the menu with ease and guided us through the process . I requested a soft crust on my Meat Eater pizza (which they call \"blonde\") it came out great !!!! Our pizzas were out to us so quick ! Pizzas were $7.95 with endless toppings . They only make personal pizzas , which I loved ! Makes the ordering so easy. I also ordered a brownie - It was LIFE ! What a wonderful experience , we will be back !"}
{"text":"My favourite pizza place in downtown. The stuff is very friendly and the location is central. Has great vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"What can I say other than this is a great place at a great price. We first discovered this place not too long after moving here. For some reason I keep passing it every time I try to make the turn into the lot.  I've done lots of U-turns for this place. It's worth it though.  I've seen some long lines in this place but don't let that fool you they handle it like real champs. You'll be in and out in no time. You can build your own pizza but why think when they have great specialty pizzas. Thinking makes my brain hurt. It's brick oven pizza  and has that slightly charred crust. I give it four stars for the food and efficiency and subtract a star for personality which is close to nonexistent. It's OK to smile and although you're working to be efficient it's OK to talk."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA I EVER HAD!! I always do the build your own...you can never go wrong with it!! I love the high rise kz its a thicker crust, but sometimes when its busy they tend not to cook it all the way. Came home with my pizza soggy as shit! But I popped it in the oven for a few and it did the trick. But, hands down best pizza I've had!!"}
{"text":"Been here several times now and love it more and more every time. I always bring friends and family with me and they enjoy it as well. Last time we were in Jon took amazing care of us. In fact, everyone is always great here and it shows customer service is huge with this place! We will be back for sure many more times! Thanks Blaze!"}
{"text":"Delicious & quick. Long line as a result of a pi day special, but staff continued to be helpful, happy, and pleasant. Fresh toppings, I wouldn't recommend choosing too many if you want them cooked. Also one pizza wasn't enough for my 2 boys to share. But one is definitely enough for me. Will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"How To Basics: 

Personalized pizza with the build as you order concept. You order what you like and they build your pizza in steps (made-from-scratch crust, Sauce, Cheese, Toppings then they bake it). Think Chipotle or Subway. Got it? Good. Easy, quick, and damn delicious. 

Cost: 

$7.65 per individual pizza with as many toppings as your heart desires. Load that puppy up and have no regrets. I love the flat rate and that they are generous with their toppings. No charging you an arm and a leg to add extra cheese/sauce/veggies or whatever artisanal ingredients you top your pizza with. They will pop it in their oven and it will be ready to go quickly. Crispy, crunchy and delicious. 

Taste:  

My husband and I have been here twice and we LOVED it!  I ordered their  'VEG OUT' both times. The Veg Out has zucchini, mushrooms, red onion, mozzarella, gorgonzola, red sauce dollops. I loaded up more veggies: artichokes, chopped garlic, red onion, roasted red peppers and spicy marinara sauce. 

My husband orders their 'MEAT EATER' that includes pepperoni, crumbled meatballs, red onion, mozzarella and red sauce (he also throws extra veggies on his.. Cuz' why not?!). We even had them cook it 'well done' so we had an extra crispy crust. 

Final Thoughts:
Quick, easy, convenient and fresh. We're in and out with our 'tum tums' full of 'Blaze' goodness. We enjoy their pizza and plan to keep this on our lunch rotation.

Yelp Review #4  2016"}
{"text":"Sweet deal. You get to put unlimited toppings on a pizza!? Pizza quality was 4/5 but overall experience was baller. Toppings such as cheese ranged from mozzerlla to gorgonzola. Meatballs to chicken. Cherry tomatoes to artichoke.
Price was great for downtown Toronto too.
Service was awesome too.
Literally felt like a kid at a candy shop."}
{"text":"First time trying this place today and it did not disappoint!!!!! I loved building my own pizza, and it was perfect. It's definitely my new spot! I have been disappointed in the past with other businesses and their premium prices. For under $9 you get the perfect pizza and it's a great size. I'm stuffed and happy!!!!! 

My husband and I will be returning at least twice a month!!!!! It's that good y'all!!!!"}
{"text":"I was so happy with this place, the employees were super friendly, food was done quickly, and was delicious! I am allergic to gluten and dairy, so usually a pizza place has very limited options for me. Well, this place has thought it all through! They have vegan cheese and an 11\" gluten free crust- both had good flavor and texture. I loaded my pizza up with a bunch of toppings and got two drinks, the total was $13.50! With the great selection, quick service, and delicious food, it definitely gets 4 stars"}
{"text":"The place is great! Your own pizza with whatever you want on it and a drink for $10.50! 
Super fresh, cooked perfectly and super fast!
Highly recommended! It's one of my few top top pizza places!"}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome, but this location needs to work on who they employ here. Order 4 pizzas and noticed after the 3rd pizza was made my 4th one was missing. Cashier says 3 pizzas?? and I said no 4 and I didn't see my 4th one being made. Not even sure how that happens considering I saw the girl write 4 tickets for them all. Fast forward first 3 are ready to pick up and go back for 4th one and I see they took it out the oven and it's literally sitting there for 4 minutes (yes I timed it) and I see the guy cutting all the other pizzas and I'm watching the order the pizzas came out so finally when mine was ready I see he skips mine and starts doing newer pizzas that just came out. So I said my pizza is right there and has been sitting there for 5 mins now. Can you just cut it so I can go. And he gives me an attitude and said one second. Freakin morons."}
{"text":"I decided to try this establishment because I heard they had good vegan pizza here. 

When I came in, they greeted me right away & asked if it was our first time in which it was. Then they explained to me the ordering process. As you go down the line, they ask you what kind of crust, sauce, cheese, & toppings you want etc. I always opt for vegan everything. That Earthlings documentary opened my eyes & changed my food choices completely. 

Everyone was pretty nice, little chit chat inquiring about how my day was going etc.

After we paid, got our drinks & found a place to sit down, they were already delivering our pizzas to us. Great service! Fast & friendly.

The pizza was thin crusted, flavorful, hot & delicious. Just how I like it so we will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza hands down. Not Chicago style or New York, etc. Blaze has more style, class, flavor, originality with the best ingredients. The folks at Blaze put their best foot forward to make sure you are happy. Any pizza, any toppings for less than $10 everyday. I have tried this place several times and never disappointed. The crust is fresh, tasty and cooked to perfection. The sauces, combination of toppings in their signature pizzas will leave you with a desire to come back real soon."}
{"text":"Ordered 7 pizzas tonight.   Very fast and fresh and affordable    Keep up good work.  :))))"}
{"text":"Great service. Fast and friendly. For only $9, size and topping options are incredible. Something for all of us. Spicy red sauce for one; regular sauce for the other. Different cheeses and meats to select from, along with all sort of veggies and ways to jazz up your pizza. Love the thin crust. By the time we paid, it was only a few more minutes for the pizzas to be done."}
{"text":"My kids love it! Lots of options. The crust is yummy. Kind of like the Chipotle line order system."}
{"text":"So Blaze pizza is good. My wife and I went a few days ago. We liked that you can get a specialized pizza, or choose your own toppings.

She chose mozzarella cheese,  onions, pepperoni,  green peppers and onios.

I chose a garlic pesto sauce, grilled chicken, also with peppers and onions .

The menu is impressive.

The pies are thin crust. I usually prefer deep dish. But in this case, I can make an exception. 

Can't wait to bring my two young daughters."}
{"text":"I was not very impressed.     The premade dough is thin and doughy and reminds me of gas station pizza.     Flavor was good,  but the dough /crust was very lacking."}
{"text":"The chipotle of pizza is legit. I never even heard of unlimited toppings on a pizza for a set price. Really enjoyed my pizza and will be a regular customer. Lebron made a wise decision to invest in blaze. So good."}
{"text":"The first person helped us really quickly to see what pies we wanted. Then she said someone else would help us. There are 6 other people working. Everyone was finding something else to do but help us. A line formed behind us and the first person was begging the staff to help the customers out. Then one employee did all of my toppings except for the last part. She said someone else would help me. I watch them fill order after order while i was still waiting to be helped. Someone finally stepped up to help. I asked for mushrooms. He said they were in the back. I said okay I'll wait. 3 minutes later i was still waiting on mushrooms when i was told that they were out of them. My party was almost done eating by the time I received my food."}
{"text":"Amazing service ...especially if you are vegan they are very well informed. They offer to change gloves....you don't have to ask. The pizzas were great. Will be visiting often."}
{"text":"Can someone tell me if oven pizza is supposed to have a burned crust? I was so excited to try this place out because I heard nothing but great things! The employees are awesome and super friendly! However, my pizza was really dry and all I could taste was the overwhelming taste of charcoal. I would recommend putting extra sauce on your pizza for a little more flavor....or to hide/cover the charcoal taste. Either way, I'm super disappointed."}
{"text":"A great, quick dinner that's always amazing. I love how you can customize your pizza. The blood orange lemonade is my favorite drink there and I always get it."}
{"text":"Went and tried Blaze Pizza for the first time. Verdict: it's amazing! 

What we ordered: *Build Your Own* Spicy marinara sauce, pesto sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, Italian meatball, pepperoni, salami, caramelized onion, roasted red pepper, roasted garlic, fresh basil, artichoke, 1/2 basaltic drizzle & 1/2 pesto drizzle.

 *White Top* White cream sauce, mozzarella, bacon, garlic, oregano, (no arugula), 1/2 pesto drizzle.

SO MANY OPTIONS FOR TOPPINGS! Next time I want to try the BBQ Chicken pizza."}
{"text":"I am a man on a mission right now to lose weight and get into shape but I love pizza so eventually I am going to have to make a sacrifice but until then Blaze Pizza is going to be my number one go to spot for pizza. The ingredients are fresh and they have healthy options too but hands down this pizza is one of the best in the valley right now.The price is right and the size of the pizza is just perfect. The amount of time to cook the pizza is fast which makes it convenient to order online and come pick up without waiting a long time."}
{"text":"Great concept...why didn't I think of this??! We had a very nice experience here, although the line was long, it moved quite quickly thanks to a quick staff. Don't think that quick equals rushed and hurried, it wasn't. The pizza was really good, the wood fired ovens make a big difference. Pieology doesn't even come close, that stuff tastes like bad frozen pizza. Blaze does it right."}
{"text":"First, last and only visit.  Had never tried Blaze  before but had heard good things. Obviously not from this location.  Attitude, unfriendly, unwelcoming staff. No greeting, just basically shut up, hurry up and order.  Will spend my money at Federal Pizza where the food and service are much better."}
{"text":"I was really hoping for a great pizza, but the actual dough tasted strange. Not sure if I got some gluten dough...it had a strange flavor. The pizza was not my favorite, I have had better tasting pizza at a similar concept pizza place on the Strip, (Project Pie). My daughter loved the pizza, so we will be back and I will give the place a 2nd chance. If the pizza does not work out for me, the S'Mores and salads are options! The likes: I liked the huge selection of toppings, which the staff was generously put atop the pizza. The dough had a rim to keep the toppings from falling off. Everyone was super friendly. The manager even came by to ask how we liked it. The unlimited amount of toppings did not effect the one priced pizza. It's nice not to pay per topping! I loved the S'More dessert which they will heat up for you in their oven. The blood orange lemonade was good, but really tasted just like lemonade. I did not taste orange juice in it. They do offer alcoholic beverages, so that is nice for an evening out with friends."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is super unique! Come in, assemble your pizza any way you'd like it from the crust to the cheese and the toppings. Then they quick fire it and have it ready for you in just a few short minutes!! Definitely worth it for the price you pay also."}
{"text":"Best personal pizza in the city??!!! And it isn't Digiorno. It's none other than this hidden gem in SouthEnd. Two things I love: running and pizza. And with their location, I'm always near the running community. They've even got a specialty running store located behind them. And a cool light rail route you can use for up to 8 miles!!"}
{"text":"So good!!! We have dairy, soy, and egg allergies. Blaze has an awesome interactive allergen menu in their website. I used that to make my choices and then ordered online. Pick up was as easy as walking in, grabbing my pies, and heading back out the door. Major points when you have a fussy four month old.

We got two pizzas, both with vegan cheese - one had applewood smoked bacon and it was YUM!!! Artichokes were also delicious. The best part, though, was the perfectly charred crust. No nasty, cardboard frozen Daiya pizza here!!

We'll be back - soon!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is so yummy and we can add as many toppings as we wish for just 8$.This is located in downtown next to train station.We can do street parking.

First we need to select the crust, then sauce (my favorite Spicy red sauce and pesto sauce), then toppings( my personal favorites are Grilled Garlic, pineapple).You can add salt and oregano also before grilling.After that pay for the pizza while pizza is getting fired in woods.Once it is done, they will call your name and we can add drizzle like pesto sauce, olive oil or barbecue sauce at end.

They also have some desserts like brownie and smore pie.

Food: 5
Service: 4
Ambience: 4"}
{"text":"Amazing silly delicious.  Reminded me of living in northern Italy. Crust is delicious people are friendly !!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good!  The staff from the line to the staff bussing tables are friendly.  Thanks Dan you got a great staff!!!"}
{"text":"Second time.  I tried gluten free.  It's ok need to cook it well done.  I like this place.  It's fresh and moves fast.  And brick oven pizza in a moving line.  Pretty cool.  Hope one comes to lake Wylie."}
{"text":"Assembly line-style pizza that is made to order and heated fairly quickly in high temperature ovens. Went here during its 2nd week of opening and it had its pros and cons.

Pros:
1. Tons of ingredients to chose from - seemingly infinite possibilities of cheeses, proteins, and vegetables
2. Great deal for someone who likes to stuff their pizzas and can eat a lot (more ingredients = same price if you order a build-your-own)
3. Personalization of ingredients in your ideal pizza
4. Made to order very quickly for a pizza

Cons:
1. Quality of the high-rise dough was subpar and falling off the pizza
2. One of the workers moved my pizza up in the assembly line without finishing my order as if she was making the decision to cap my order for me. Granted, it was a busy day and I'm sure they were flustered.
3. Really didn't sit well afterwards (which is abnormal for me)

I personally prefer Pie's the Limit if I'm going to a build your own pizza place in the area."}
{"text":"What a gorgeous meal. I was pleasantly surprised at the all-you-can-top pizza! I picked three different cheeses, three meats, and five veggies, and had an amazing meal.

The ingredients were fresh, the staff was friendly in recommending their personal favourite toppings, and as a first-timer at Blaze, they drew a smiley face on my order sheet (I'm actually not too sure about the significance of this smiley face, but perhaps it signalled the rest of the team to be more friendly with me?).

For $10.45, it's makes for a great lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I went with some friends and I gotta say, the pizza was pretty good. I'm a huge sauce guy and the variety and taste of sauces was very good. It's sort of like a subway setup but I ended up going with a pre-selected option. There's also a great variety of cheeses which is pretty cool if you want to try something new. The combinations that are preset definitely work well, and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"My brother and I love this place!! We come here almost 2 times a week, I always get the make yourself pizza, spicy sauce, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, tomatoes, banana peppers, onions, sea salt, pepper! The staff is super nice!"}
{"text":"It's what you expect. Nothing amazing. Stingy with the cheese. The price is right but I'm not going to go out if my way to go here for a pizza craving.  That's all I have to say"}
{"text":"The name really says IT ALL... almost all..
                             They left out FRIENDLY and DELICIOUS.
 The Gluten Free and Vegan options with the most amazing \"BUILD YOUR OWN\" pizza and the price is very reasonable. We showed up about half an hour before they were closing, the David Copperfield show ended later than we thought, which almost kept us from going. I don't like going to restaurants when they are that close to closing due to the fact they usually are starting the tear down, Which means  ingredients that are not fresh. BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH BLAZE. EVERYTHING WAS FRESH. THE ATMOSPHERE IS CASUAL AND CLEAN. THE EMPLOYEES GREATED US (ALL 8) WITH A SMILE AND WERE VERY INFORMATIVE ABOUT THE MENU.  
WE HAVE FOUND OUR NEW FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE."}
{"text":"The employees are very sweet and works fast. It is a great place for families and a nice hang out place. The price is amazing because you get to choose as much toppings as you want. The pizza is also a good size. My boyfriend was excited and got all the toppings. The blood orange lemonade was delicious. 

However, I felt like the flavor of the pizza was kinda bland. There are 3 sauces but one is just a spicy version."}
{"text":"This place is freakin fantastic! 
Immediately greeted by the staff. We were given a rump WM on how it works which was super helpful. The entire staff was extremely friendly & fun. I tried 1/2 BBQ Chicken & 1/2 Art Lover. Every bit of it was sooooo delicious!  I will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The service is great & the pizza is even better!! Tried 1/2 BBQ chicken & 1/2 white top. Hubby created his own. They were both perfectly baked & absolutely delicious! We will definitely be back....a lot! ;-D"}
{"text":"The service from Kellie(Kellay) is amazing! She walked me through the whole process with a smile. She knew about the ingredients and did everything with ease! I thought she was a manager the way she was able to direct employees and still be so attentive to the customers! Ohhh yeah.... the pizza was AMAZING but customer service makes people come back! Sincerely Brittney"}
{"text":"Build-your-own-pizza with huge selection of toppings - unlimited for the same price! Of course I pretty much put everything on it. My fav combo: jalapeno, pineapple, sausage, garlic, topped with pesto drizzle."}
{"text":"I have no reason to unlike any bit of it - therefore it's a 5 stars.

The process of D.I.Ying your own pizza is pretty straightforward. it's like building your own sub at Subways. You choose the sauce, type of cheese, veggies and meat that goes on it. And just about 7 mins, it's ready.

The pizza is very yummy, made to order, fresh, and crunchy. If you love thin crusts, you'll instantly love the pizza here. And because you can build it however you like, you can even make them taste like garlic fingers. :)

The service here is top notch. When I was waiting in the line, the lady in front of me was being very rude and demanding to the staff, and the staff was being patient and polite. It was handled very professionally. I was very impressed with the good service they were giving. 

Overall, it is super worthy going back. I recommend to all pizza-lovers!"}
{"text":"I guess my expectations were a bit much.  I missed an event here a week ago, but that wasn't going to stop me.  I love a good pizza and I will drive  half an hour to get it.  

Blaze has some great menu items. And, I love the simple menu pricing.  Very similar to Zablong in Uptown.  

I actually had a hard time choosing between the signature pizzas. I love BBQ, so it was a tough selecting to order the Green Stripe.  Yum.

So, I love to order ahead and Blaze has an online ordering system. It's very easy to use and I was able to chose my pickup time.  I ordered at 535 and set my pickup time for 550.

After circling a bit I finally found a parking stall.  By the time I walked in it was just after 550.  I went to pickup my order at the call in order area expecting to be able to grab and go.  Unfortunately the pizza wasn't ready, so we had to wait...

....and wait.  Several patrons were waiting, but the joint was by no means crowded: Maybe 10 people there total. 15-minutes later they called a carry out ready for \"Chuck.\"  We stood and watched for about 5-minutes.  Chuck never appeared.  The folks behind the counter picked up the pizza and then called out Brad. That's me! Wow. Big difference between Chuck and Brad.  Ended up wasting 20-minutes with 5-minutes reserved for my pizza to get cold.  

If I hadn't ordered online expecting to be ahead of the game and then waiting for a pizza that should have been ready, followed by more wasted time and a drive home I'd be a little less preturbed.  

The pizza itself isn't what we ordered.  I'm guessing because they just threw what they had at us.  If it's called a green stripe and no arugula is on it. No pesto drizzle either...not sure what to say.  Poor product.  I just prefer a little more organization and attention to details. 

I'll reconsider the next time I decide to stop in for a beer at Lenny Boy.  Right now, Blaze isn't serving the brew but apparently it's part of their future."}
{"text":"First chance to get back here following an awesome Yelp event.

You might categorize this as \"fast food\" and you'd be partly right - it is fast - your pizza cooks in 3 minutes. However, throw all your preconceived notions of \"fast food\" out the window. It's fresh, healthy and custom made in front of you.

The simple /plain cheese pizza is only $5!! For another couple of dollars you can create your own with unlimited toppings. The topping and sauce selections go on and on. I tend to get carried away and have a mile high pizza. If that's too overwhelming, they have suggested recipes/combos on the menu board.

Fresh salads - highly addictive Blood Orange Lemonade - S'mores pie (get it toasted!).

Hopefully soon they'll have beer! Don't be scared of the line - it will move quickly. You also see the owner jumping and helping out and even cleaning tables! That says a lot about the quality of service and work ethic here! Really convenient Southend location!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza just the way I like it.  One of my favorite pizza joints.  For 11.65$ u can customize your pizza with as many toppings as you want, but u probably won't want to put all the toppings just because it will be hard to hold up the slice of pizza when it comes out.  The smores cookies were delicious, each cookie is $3.  Alcohol prices are pretty similar to other places.  The crust is nice and thin, which I love.  It's fresh and fast.  Staff is friendly.  It's one of those places where you place your order at the front and they will call you when your pizza is ready.  Like panera bread for those of you that's been.  Overall good experience.  I liked it and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm so mad at the fact that I'm new to this place and l stood in line for over 20 minutes and got a burnt half pizza! The managers were just standing by observing all the pizzas that came out of the oven but didn't say anything about giving me another pizza! I requested my money back and left! Really poor customer service!"}
{"text":"Had the most monstrous pizza craving and took a chance on this spot. Winner winner, pizza dinner!!! Great experience overall from the warm greeting to the full explanation of how it all goes down, to the guy who got me a box for the rest of my pizza.

So many options here, but I'm sure it's hard to make a bad pie. I went for gold with all of my favorite toppings. Idk if I was tripping, but they have some of the loveliest ricotta I've ever had in my life! Pizza was delicious and it was hard to stop at just half.

Went for the blood orange lemonade, but I wish it were a little more blood-orangey. Still a nice, sweet refresher to wash it all down with, so nobody's losing stars over it.

I'll surely be back again and again to try more combos."}
{"text":"I had veggie pizzas here. Frankly, the option of choosing various toppings like we do in Subway is what I liked most."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've ever had. My boyfriend and I went on a Friday Night- it was fairly busy;however, the line was moving quickly. This was my first time going to Blaze Pizza, ordering your pizza is like ordering a sub from Subway. You can either build your own pizza or order one of their signature pizza's and add whatever extra toppings you want. The staff were super friendly and accommodating. 

I ordered the Art Lover-- added extra basil, sautéed onions, red peppers, olives, cherry tomatoes and finished it off with pesto. My boyfriend ordered the Meat Lovers-- added extra spinach, mushrooms, green peppers, and olives. 

The Art Lover tasted very light and was extremely delicious everything complimented each other wonderfully. I did not feel heavy at all after finishing the whole pizza. The Meat Lover was super flavourful, hearty, and delicious but didn't leave you with a heavy feeling either. You can clearly taste how fresh the ingredients are. 

Along with the pizzas Blaze offers their own drinks. We got their lemonade and grapefruit. Both were refreshing. 

I will definitely be back and wish Blaze had a location where I'm from!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick bite in a casual atmosphere (but not old and archaic) than you will like Pizza Blaze. You will spend about $10 for a drink and small pizza, but flavor is not compromised!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place today and I loved everything about it. The food is awesome but the service there is amazing. Every single staff member was friendly, upbeat, and smiled. 

Line moves quickly and every request was taken care of with a smile. Ordered a pepperoni pizza, the meat eater, and the BBQ chicken pizza. Blood orange lemonade was so refreshing and they offer some specialty beverages too. Caesar salad was fresh and we had chocolate chip cookies warmed up for us while we ate our pizza. 

Sat at a table and a worker brought us a high chair for our son and napkins without us even having to ask. Food was great and service was on point. 

Every guest was welcomed upon walking through the door and thanked when they exited. 

Thank you Blaze Pizza for exceeding expectations. I wish more places took customer service to the next level like your staff does. Can't wait to return for more food and top notch service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  We originally were on our way to a different resterant but the outside attire caught our attention and we turned around. Right when we walked in the line looked a little long but the staff was so quick and friendly.  The way it is set up is it has a \"Chipotle\" style bar so you can build your own pizza.  We got the build your own style with as many toppings you want for 7.95
The pizza was amazing. The staff was amazing. The price and location are amazing. The website even has online ordering and nutrional chart for your order. Amazing."}
{"text":"Soooooooo good. Sooooooooo fresh. Not greasy at all. Surprisingly fast too. The price is amazing for the amount of fresh food you get. If there was one near me I would eat here a lot. YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll update with a longer update because I have a lot of good things to say about this place but I love it here! The staff is SO friendly and thoughtful when preparing my vegan pizza. They really are great and seem to be having an awesome time. I LOVE that they now have \"popcorn chicken\" (made from tofu) and that they don't charge extra from cheese. I have so much fun making my own pizza every time. It's a big pizza for a little price! Can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"Great pizza when it's done right. Unfortunately in this case, I got to the cash and they realized my crust wasn't gluten free like I asked for. I had to start again. Got my pizza home and it wasn't fully cooked. I have eaten at Blaze in LA and in Chicago, both were great experiences. This one not so much. I will still go back as I do enjoy the pizza."}
{"text":"First timers here and experienced Great service, and delicious pizza too! I like being able to customize the pizza to each family members liking. The price is decent too.  This is definitely our go to pizza place!!!"}
{"text":"If this pizza restaurant doesn't deserve 5 stars, I am not sure which does.  I debated about 4 or 5 stars and I am not easily pleased.  We have gone 3 times now and laugh about having to pace ourselves so we don't get burned out but this food is addictive!!!!  They are almost always busy, but are VERY efficient at getting you in and eating!  I love being able to have my pizza made EXACTLY as I want it.  Choose the toppings, and how much of each, walk down the line and watch your pizza cook in just 3 minutes.  Amazing and delicious!!!!   The staff, for the most part, appear to be college students and have a great attitude.  You are treated like old friends and the smiles and jokes go a long way toward making you want to go back again and again.  We are hooked!!!"}
{"text":"Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza is a chain that already has locations in about 11 US states, and looks to be rapidly expanding to about 15 more US states and Canadian provinces.  This is the first LV Valley location (another is coming soon).  I would compare the process to the Chipotle or Subway experience, but for pizza.  All pies are 11\" personal size, thin crust, and $7.65 regardless of # of toppings.

You go down a line and first choose your crust: regular or gluten-free. Note: They do advise that they don't use a separate oven or dough press, so if you are highly sensitive to gluten, you may want to use caution if you eat here.  

Then you choose one of their 8 signature pizzas or to build your own (choose sauce type, cheeses, meats, & veggies).  Once your pizza is built, it is fired for three minutes, cut and brought to you.

They also have salads, s'mores, soda, lemonade, & iced tea.  This location also has beer & wine.  However, I would consider this more of a lunch place than a dinner place.

I enjoyed my ham, spinach, tomato, & garlic pie.  The sauce was good and all the toppings were fresh.  The crust was crispy, but lacked flavor and was very thin.  It was the let me down for me.  

All in all, I would visit again for a quick, inexpensive lunch.  It was not the best pizza I've ever had, but I don't think that's their schtick."}
{"text":"This was a great stop. Loved the ability to make my own pizza just the way I love a pizza. Quick but tasty. If you're looking for a thin-crust that is not mushy don't hesitate to stop in! We ordered the Dough Knots but if it were me, I'd pass on them. The pizza is much better! The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star rating is because the ambience was fast food...and I'm not looking for fast food experiences."}
{"text":"Blase, blase, blase (as Future would say). This place is always fuego flame (literally). I love how you can see everything going into your pizza like a Chipotle. You can add anything you want usually for no extra charge. They are always slam packed! The employees are in sync like an IN N Out! Well they gotta be! Place is awesome for a great price! Freshness guaranteed.

{"text":"For less than eleven dollars you can have your individual pizza fixed with any topping you want. I started with the special meateaters and then added extra olives, banana peppers, jalepenos, green peppers, artichoke hearts, extra onions, roasted garlic. I did not measure the size of the pie, but I would guess it is 11 inches. I had to get the leftovers in a take out box. I also really liked the lemonade."}
{"text":"It's quick, inexpensive pizza. If you know that going in, you won't be disappointed. I love pizza you'd really have to mess it up for me to write a bad review. With that said, I don't like eating my Pizza on that piece of paper because when I cut my pizza I also cut the paper. They don't have plates so there was no option. My second observation of this establishment is every person working behind the counter mumbled. I know, that has nothing to do with the food nor does it have anything to do with the restaurant it's more the generation. Yep, I've become my parents"}
{"text":"Great staff to help you out with their choices. You can get unlimited toppings with your very own custom pizza all for under 9 dollars. Pizza tastes great, will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"I think I found my favorite stop. Dont know how it's not 5 stars..... I'll be referring this place to everyone."}
{"text":"This place is extremely vegan friendly. All the crusts are vegan and the vegan cheese is great. They actually take cross contamination seriously and will do a glove change before handling your food if you specify that you're vegan. Plus, some places will offer vegan crust, sauce, and cheese and then skimp on the toppings but not here. They had literally every vegetable i could imagine putting on a pizza. Adding balsamic after baking makes it even better."}
{"text":"I love this place and come here a few times a year with the kids. The most awesome thing is that you can build your own pizza from scratch and choose from almost every type of ingredient possible. My kids love ordering their pizza with lots of meat, bacon, sausages, chicken, hamburger meat and what not. Personally I like to have a lot of garlic and some pesto sauce with lots of pepperoni on it. The speed in which you get your fresh thin crust pizza is amazing. The staff is always so warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Well, now that the grand opening excitement and jitters have died down, the worker morale and food quality is also plummeting. Our first few visits were amazing; great helpers, great pizzas, clean place. Unfortunately, our last handful of visits have gotten worse each time. We are now met with an extremely rude staff, especially on Sundays, who don't even make eye contact with you. They're constantly joking around, yelling to each other, and acting as if they don't care about the customer. Perhaps they don't, but they should at least pretend to. The pizza is sometimes slightly burnt on the bottom which seems to happen more when the store is busier. This is easy to overlook, however, the staff's attitude is not so easy to ignore. We were so unhappy with our recent visits that we emailed Blaze headquarters and CCed this store on the email. HQ answered ... and offered us free pizza (after us stating in the email that we will never be visiting again - unless the issues are fixed. Offering free pizza doesn't fix the issue). The store never answered. 

It's sad to see great places fall, especially pizza places ... of all things (who doesn't LOVE pizza?!). In good conscience, we can no longer recommend this place to anyone. Our last visit was the final straw and we haven't been back since, even despite living 2 minutes walking distance away."}
{"text":"Customer service is great and the pizza is phenomenal! I've tried Mod pizza, Fired Pie, My Pie and Blaze (all similar chains) and Blaze has beat them all! I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Order 9:30 via DoorDash. Pizza was so bored on bottom. Hit or miss... good great food but crew customer service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"This place is excellent . Apparently it's a chain because we went to this place in Utah also. Very good and fresh never disappoints . The employees are very nice and work well together"}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is very fresh and tasty pizza. The atmosphere and the way you order is similar to a subway. You go through a line and decide what you want on your pizza. There are tons of options, and it's baked in a wood fired oven which makes the pizza delicious. 

The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is, for me, I didn't like how they served this pizza. You get up from your seat and are not called over a microphone, rather your name is shouted out. While yelling my name really isn't a big deal, it can get quite annoying when it's busy and it continues during your dining experience."}
{"text":"My new addiction! I love how fresh all the ingredients are, and I'm able to see how my pizza is prepared just the way I like it. Plus, it's super affordable no matter how much ingredients you pile on!"}
{"text":"I visited last night for a to go order expecting it to be good like the other Blaze Pizza. To my disappointment both the pizzas I got was burnt. 

Kyle & his team were amazing and was quick to replace the pizza. I recommend this place and will be a regular."}
{"text":"Went there last night after someone had told me how great it was, I placed my order online so that way all Id had to do was to check in and they would fire up my pizzas. Well over 20mins goes by and my name hasn't been called came to the point where I start seeing people that came after me get their food already. So my husband goes up and asks them where the order is since their oven cooks your pizza in 180 seconds and we have been waiting for over 20mins, I guess someone forgot to fire them up. So we had been waiting that whole time for nothing. You would think since they had over 15 people working that everything would get done on time. Once we finally got our pizzas I started eating mine and notice that my sauce wasn't even on my pizza and had to go back up, after waiting already just to get my food. Overall I LOVED the pizza! This is just a very good tip to let people know if you place an order online once you check in at the cashier make sure you see them put your pizzas in the oven. 5 stars for the pizza, but not so much for the fast service."}
{"text":"Being Italian, I love pizza, it's great because you can cook to order with awesome tasty ingredients and very filling!
Sometimes to warm in the location but for on the go pizza it's awesome"}
{"text":"Took my son here for a free pizza from a coupon he had. No complaints. Also sign up for a free drink thru the app they are offering, again no complaints. Can't complain for over free food! Overall, my son say's dad, it's TASTEY!"}
{"text":"I've been to similar pizza places in other cities, and for some reason I was craving pizza when I was in Tempe. Reasonably priced and able to customize it to taste? Check.

The staff got a little annoying, calling me by name like 3 or 4 times throughout the ordering process. I'm sure they're trained that way, but whoever's managing this place... it's a bit much! That aside, I tried the gluten-free pizza with a bunch of random toppings, and it was really good. Had most of it there, and ate the rest back at my hotel a few hours later.

Cool setup in this shop with plenty of seating. We arrived just in time, watching a big line form behind us! Good timing!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! My only complaint about this place is the long lines and the wait. The guys who hand you the pizza can also use some kindness, but despite them the rest of the staff is warm and friendly.

The ordering system must change. People walk the line without knowing what they want and this holds the entire process. This is not going to be a quick lunch but if you have at least 1 hour go for it. There isn't a better pizza place around.

Pizza is freshly made, dough is nice and crispy. Sauce is not overloaded in garlic (if has at all -- it shouldn't to be called red sauce) and the ingredients are fresh. My favorite place in town and I go at least twice a week.

4 stars only for the lack of better parking and better ordering system. Online orders should be made available soon.

Update: Bumped to 5 stars now that they have online, phone and app ordering system! Parking is still an issue, but that's not going to change, it will only get worse."}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is one of my go-to in Dundas area. I usually get their BYO Pizza, where you can choose your sauce, cheese, meat, and veggies. Friendly staffs and quick service, the only thing is I wish some of the staffs could be more generous with the amount of toppings. It is a bit pricey for a pizza but you get to put how many/ whatever toppings you want so I'd say it's worth it. ($11.95 + tax)"}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is always really good.  I have been to the one on south end and really liked it so when it came to the University area, I was really excited. Inside is really nice. Keep in mind, during the weekdays at night it can get really busy."}
{"text":"Lebron!! Enjoy your basketball but enjoy your pizza even more!! Blaze is my favorite \"make your own pizza\" place."}
{"text":"First time here. We arrived and there was not a line so we were impressed with the speed of the process. We then saw the line quickly build and slow down. We each ordered a build your own pizza and a side greek salad. Not sure what made the Greek salad greek...the olives maybe? There was no feta cheese and the lemon dressing made the salad unable to be eaten. After receiving your pizza there are toppings you can add on for free. Like a drizzle of olive oil or arugula. That was nice but would have liked to know that is an option up front. Also, they didn't offer it you have to ask. I had pepperoni and my spouse had Italian meatball as toppings. I had 6 pieces of pepperoni on the entire pizza. There was also very minimal meatballs on the second pizza. I like a thin and crispy pizza. The pizza was thin enough but it is still doughy. It was brown on  the bottom and the edges were brown/black but the pizza itself was still doughy. If you want a quick pizza with a sparing amount of toppings fast then this is your place. We will try again but next time I will ask for the meat to be ALL over the pizza and ask if they can cook the dough through without burning it."}
{"text":"The menu and pricing here is confusing, but I won't reflect that in my rating because maybe I'm just a bit dense, lol. This place has incredible pizza and variety of toppings! IMO, it's exactly like Fired Pie - which is a good thing! Same concept, too, stand in line and pick out your toppings and pay at the end.  I love that they have the option to drizzle balsamic over the pizza when it comes out of the oven, it really makes it!  They also have whole garlic cloves and full basil leaves. Amazing! The place was super clean and felt like new. Lots of tables and also a very nice patio scene!"}
{"text":"Great spot.  Good, light atmosphere. Part of me expected it to be full of annoying kids with it being so close to Ryerson but there was actually a good mix of people. People that work here were super friendly and the pizzas are quite good! I had the meat eaters and my boyfriend made his own. It's pretty cool because you can put anything you want on it (everything if you like!) Good spot, great vibes (it's licensed :)), I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! I consider myself to be a very lucky gal (or not so lucky when you think of all the calories that I'll be consuming now I've discovered this gem!). Why you ask? Because it's literally a 5-minute walk from my office! 

I love the concept of building your own pizza with unlimited topping - you get to eat what you really love! Plus, the super thin crust means less carbs (yes, please!). I especially love the fact that they have 4 different types of sauces that you can mix - also if you're a huge pesto fan like I am, don't forget to ask for pesto drizzle as you're picking up your freshly made pizza.

Another aspect that made this place so special is how easy and fast it is for them to make pizzas - the wait time was less than 5 minutes for me, on a very packed Friday afternoon.  

I'd say this place is the real deal and will definitely reco it to everyone! With the price as low at $10.49, it's definitely my new go-to place for lunch."}
{"text":"Really good pizza in a pretty casual setting. It came out quick and tasted crispy and delicious. Excellent options for vegetarians as well. We tried 3 of the pizzas off of the menu, but there's a lot of room to customize and get creative.

The manager was pretty great as well. They were having some issues with their debit machine and, while we didn't mind waiting or paying in cash, he insisted on giving us the meal for free. I'll definitely be heading back here when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"When we first walked in, we were asked if it was our first time eating at Blaze Pizza. Since it was, they were eager to explain how it worked. Love this concept of personal customizable pizza. The dough was fresh and baked in the oven on the spot. You can choose from their signatures or make your own completely and add any toppings you'd like. Nice upgrade from a standard pizza pie that you have to share because it's too large for one person. Here, each person can have whatever they want."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff...super hard to chew gluten free pizza, Daiya cheese is gross for vegans guys....their other pizzas rock though!"}
{"text":"Went to the Elite Event. Had a blast love meeting other Yelpers. 

FOOD: I had the BYOP (Build Your Own Pizza). Blaze Pizza will remind you of Subway but it's pizza. You are able to pick you own toppings or one of the specialty pizza. All pizzas are cooked with order. I also had the Kale salad, it was a little to vinegary for me. The cookies was good (I had the chocolate chip). They have fresh lemonade that is made daily, the Mango flavor is VERY LIGHT, the Lemonade flavor is VERY tart. The best flavor is the bloody orange (the name is something like that) and another good one is the Strawberry (tho' it was a very lite flavor it was not too sweet and was not watered down like the Mango flavor)

INSIDE: Nice set up, they had UNCC colors on the wall. They have high table and regular tables and outdoor seating. Tho' if the place is packed it could be a bit loud. The staff was super nice and the manager and some of the owners were nice also. Once I told the young lady that took my order,that I have never been to Blaze pizza before she explained how it work.

Location: There is a free parking in a lot, you can walk from Blaze to Boardwalk(which is a good). The location is perfect and right by other shops. 

Price: great price around $6.00 and up"}
{"text":"Here is the restaurant equation folks:

Chipotle concept + Awesome thin crusted Pizza = the beautiful creation of this Blaze joint that destroys Pizza Hut and Dominos combined.

I wish I knew about this place months ago in the heart of Southend. On a pizza craving whim, I decided to give this place a shot on a Sunday night.

First of all, the size of their pies were perfect (about 13-14 inches) with gluten-free dough as one of the options; solid selections in sauces, cheeses, and protein. 

What ultimately did it for me?!.... their BYO pizzas were ALL UNDER $8. Oh and did I mention it was also unlimited toppings? Yeah..I don't know what deal is going trump that.

After building the meanest pie stacking all sorts of toppings on there, it took nearly 5 mins to cook. And most importantly, the freshness and quality was there after inhaling the first 5 bites.

Y'all need to go!"}
{"text":"pretty decent place for pizza! not as thin and crispy as i'd hoped, but still good. love the AYCE style toppings, got a little adventurous and added gorgonzola cheese to my pizza, that was my only regret. best tip would probably be not to overload the toppings. yes it's exciting to add seven cheeses and eight meat options but remmeber, more toppings = soggier pizza! love the little burned edges of the regular dough. husband got the high dough (additional $2) and it was nice and chewy, for those who don't like the crispy pizzas. fave toppings were artichoke, turkey meatballs and spicy red sauce and pesto topping to finish off."}
{"text":"The spot to eat in Southend when you need that pizza fix and you can eat inside or outside. Service is good and the they take the cake in the fast pizza biz. 9x out of 10 I do the create your own and fix something up as I go down the line."}
{"text":"Came for Friday lunch and there was a long lineup. Fortunately, they have a tight system down and we got our pizzas in hand in around 20 minutes. 

I built my own one topping pizza, which includes sauce, cheese and one topping. I went with spicy red sauce with ovalini mozzarella and crumbled meatballs. They are really good at making sure you are happy with the amount of each topping before putting it into the pizza. It was nice to watch them cook it and anticipate having a freshly baked pizza in hand.

Overall a good pizza, spicy red sauce had a kick and the mozzarella helped balance out the flavors. The crust was well baked but I would have preferred it a little more charred. Better than most take out!"}
{"text":"I love this place! You can have the pizza made to your liking, or order something off of the menu. I really like that. I typically get pepperoni with Kalamata olives. Delish!

The taste reminds me of Grimaldi's without the wait and restaurant atmosphere. The only reason it doesn't get five stars because the place is so small! You really have to fight for a table if you're dining in. There's nothing they can do about that and awesome for them that business is that good. But it's still a royal pain, especially if you're dining in during your lunch break from work. With that being said, I will be a repeat offender. The pizza is just too darn good not to deal with the seating issue. Awesomeness!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good amount of seating. We went around 11:40 and there was no line up. They should add an option to do half sizes or half pizza and half salad. The pizzas are pretty sizeable but not big enough to share with 2 people."}
{"text":"Rain? Or Reyne I didn't see her name tag on her hat because she was so busy but she gave me some of the best service ever! So friendly and very quick with the whole process, will return!"}
{"text":"I can say from walking in a first thought of chipotle from the layout. The staff were great and the first thing I was asked if it was my first time proceeding to yes they paid extra attention to my order. I got a build your own which was a flat price of 8$ unlimited toppings. I was iffy about how good the toppings would be seeing that I can put as much as I would like. Let me tell you they were fresh and this is the best pizza I have had in Las Vegas. It's personal size just right for yourself and a slice or two for later! And the blood orange lemonade was fresh tangy and just right!!! I can't wait to go back and try the toppings I didn't have the first go around!!"}
{"text":"Another awesome Blaze Pizza chains. We got to dine in and eat here while we're visiting Calgary. We had \"Built Your Own Pizza\". Built Your Own, Choosing any Toppings  for 1 Prices. Toppings included Large Selections of Meats, Vegetables, Cheese and Sauces too. Salads and drinks too. 

We had a great experiences here with my family."}
{"text":"I mean, this place is really no different from any other build-your-own pizza place. But something about it is special. I built my own pizza and I put all seven kinds of cheese on it lol. It was so good. Their signature pizzas sound appetizing, as well. The servers are really friendly and fast. The possibilities for the different kinds of pizzas you can make are endless. Definitely a go-to for any pizza lover."}
{"text":"If we are comparing MOD and blaze pizza, I would vote for blaze, strictly on the taste of their ingredients. But blaze was about as cheap with there toppings as I've ever seen. My wife actually said \"what the hell is that?\" It was like a cracker with some sauce and a tablespoon of cheese on it. She was not happy at al with the size, look or taste of her gluten free pizza.
I had the meat lovers and the taste was really good, but it was basically an appetizer. For the tots of $21 we both left hungry and I actually stopped on the way home to get a chicken sandwich .
So I'm not really sure what all the buZz about over at blaze pizza"}
{"text":"Living just a mile from the new Blaze Pizza shop, I watched as it was being built and decided to stop a few days after it opened.  This was my first time at a build your own pizza place.  Instead of putting together my own, I opted for one of their signature pizzas--the meat lovers pizza.  I asked about thick pizza and I was told that for an extra charge I'd get extra dough.  I don't know what the extra was because I didn't receive a receipt.

I took my glass and got some iced tea.  Real sugar was the only sweetener available.  I asked about artificial sweeteners and the worker said, \"You mean sugar.\"  I explained what I wanted.  His response was they only have sugar.

I sat down with my iced tea and waited for my name to be called.  When it was, my order was in a takeout box even though I said I was eating in.  That didn't matter so much but the crust did.  When I went to pick up my first slice, the crust came apart as the thicker pizza is just another thin layer of crust placed on top of the first one.  You have to wait for the pizza to cool down some before the two layers adhere better.

There was no salt or pepper on the tables and there were no packets at the fountain area.  I saw another table had a jar of grated cheese and a jar of seasonings.  I didn't know until the couple left where these came from until the worker cleaned the table and took them to a counter near the blazing area.  So if you don't know where things are because you've never been to a Blaze before, you don't know what they have.  I can't see the reason for removing this from the table.

The pizza was OK.  The whole experience was not.  There are too many places to get pizza in this area.  Now I've been there and done that but no more Blaze for me.

I will give them kudos for using plastic glasses that are plant based rather than petroleum."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch and it was pretty good! I love pizza but hate all the grease and when it's super thick so I really enjoyed the thin crispy crust and fresh ingredients. I ordered red vine which has fresh mozzarella, basil and grape tomatoes. I thought it could use a bit more flavor but that mostly my fault since I later found out you can add whatever you want to the pizza. The staff was very friendly, it came out quickly and was large enough to share (if you're not super hungry). I'd go back next time I'm in the mood for pizza!"}
{"text":"Everything related to this restaurant is just perfect be it food, price, quality or location.
I recently visited the restaurant with my husband. We ordered build your own pizza. They offer unlimited toppings in just $10.45
They have a huge range of toppings and you can choose as per your preference.
I just loved the place and pizza and will visit again very soon. Its one of my favourite pizza places in the city."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places ! I love that you can create your own pizzas with the different toppings."}
{"text":"I loove pizza more than Michelangelo (TMNT) and Blaze Pizza never disappoints when I'm visiting downtown for work or just to hang out. 

Location is super convenient for people commuting as it's right on Dundas Square and right beside the Eaton Centre Mall. Whats great about this joint is that they have a build you own pizza for a cheap price of $10 + tax. I've made my own pizza before and I've also picked from their menu of pizza combinations, can't go wrong. There is an option of gluten-free dough for all you gluten free peeps and let me tell you it taste amazing and crispy!

I love how you go in a line and pick your toppings for the pizza and then by the time you finish paying you wait 5 or so more minutes for your name to be called and voila! FRESH PIZZA! The whole process from ordering and picking your toppings to paying your bill and grabbing your drink and waiting for your name to be called can taken up to 10-15 mins max (that's if you know what your ordering).

The restaurant is clean, simple decor nothing fancy which i like! Parmesan, Chili flakes, and Tobasco are all conviniently placed on a shelf for you to help yourself. 

Great for lunch and dinner! I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Oh I like these new pizza places popping up! This place is still the best one I've been to (4 and counting in the valley). Lots of toppings and they didn't skimp on ingredients. Kept the prep/work area behind the glass clean and the ingredients separate. Delicious!

And yes...I put pineapple on my pizza...you may feel the need to dismiss my review based on that...I hear that pineapple pizza is pretty political these days! Lol"}
{"text":"If the pizza is bad, it's your fault. You literally walk the line and tell them exactly what and how much to put on... its fast, cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"I got a high rise cheese pizza , it was so delicious! Also got the s'more pie it was so yummy ! This is my new go to pizza place , I will definitely be coming back ! Also they were very friendly and explained how everything went !"}
{"text":"To boil down the concept, it's basically \"Subway\" for pizza.  It fit the bill for what we were looking for - you pick you bread, toppings, etc. as you go down the line, and they make your pizza in front of you.

From a process design perspective, i personally enjoyed how the pizza is passed from person to person, how they keep track of which pizza belongs to each party when it's in the oven (metal tents w/ numbers).

When we ate there we originally planned to take our pizza to go, as it was quite crowded and we didn't see any open tables.  it cleared out a bit before we got our pizza so we did end up grabbing a table, but we hadn't ordered drinks, assuming that we would just have something from the fridge.  One of the Blaze employees (wish i had gotten his name) came by and offered us cups of water - and he did this for a few other tables as well - really nice customer service and going above and beyond."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in downtown toronto. I can load on as many toppings as I want. I pay one price. And it comes out fast. What more can you ask for?! I wish they expanded all over the GTA. I hate having to go down there just to get my fix. Please open more locations! The cheese ball is the best cheese option if you were wondering. 5 stars all day, every day *****"}
{"text":"I see a lot of 5 Star reviews so maybe we came on an off night.  Made order online which was easy enough. When I got there our pizzas were coming out of oven. The last one was totally burned on one side - Black.  The fellow that made them was all too happy to box it up and give it to my family though. He did not care in the least.  I had to ask another much friendlier fellow if they were going to serve that to us.  He looked at the charred mass and offered to make us a new one.  As we waited for the redo,  our other pizzas got cold (no heat lamps) and the salad they put on top of our boxes got hot.  

When we finally got home with our three pizzas, two were stone cold, burned around the edges, and tough and chewy. The one they remade was okay but the toppings were very sparse. Judging from the dark soot on the bottom of each pie their oven needed a good cleaning as well. You could taste the carbon residue.  Pepperonis were too spicy for my kids to eat so we finally settled on the wilted salad.  Not bad and not burned.  

Not impressed. Nope.  Not in the least. Happy to chalk it up to new business jitters though. May try it again...maybe not.  Overall meh."}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life Blaze? Went there for the first time today for a late lunch and oh my goodness! Their pizza is good! The place has a modern feel. You line up, choose your crust, sauce, choose any of their specialty pizzas or build your own. We ordered 1 cheese pizza for the little one and a build your own for me with spicy marinara sauce, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, ham, spinach, olives and mushrooms with a sprinkling of oregano plus a fountain drink then you watch them slide your pizza in the oven. All in all we paid $16....not bad. Not even 8minutes we got piping hot pizzas. Both are medium sized with thin crust. My little one swears this is the best cheese pizza she has ever had. Mine was yummylicious! I might never eat pizza anywhere else again.

Funny thing is this place is just across from the newest LVAC on Decatur. Ha! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was fast even thou and entire basketball team walked in 5 seconds before me LOL. I had half pizza with small salad. Simplly delicious and i had leftovers. The parking sucks on Saturday becaused its a shared parking lot with multiple stores."}
{"text":"Always do build your own pizza. Yummy yummy yummy. Salad are fresh and flavorful.  Even when the line is to the door it doesnt take long."}
{"text":"What you do is you load up the pizza w/ all the stuff you want, then roll it up like a cannoli/burrito/eggroll/gyro and go for a stroll while people gawk and wonder in silence where you got that amazing thing/abomination/giant eggroll from. 

It's better than any pizza you'll get from any of the other chains on offer here. That's not saying much, but whatever, go enjoy your pizza roll."}
{"text":"Great service!!!! Everyone is so nice here!! Funny thing happened....  As they were putting my deliciously customized pizza in the oven,  they accidentally dropped it...  Haha but as a courtesy for me having to redo the whole process,  they gave me the pizza on the house!! That's awesome service!! Most place never comp you for your time and I thought it was something very nice! I will Def come again!! Not only is the service great but so is the food!! They even have spicy sauce! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Super awesome experience. Raye, X and Ema were the best. Super amazing and one of the best customer experiences I've ever had"}
{"text":"Personalized to your liking. You can pile it on and no up charge on additional topping. My favorite is the white sauce pizza with basil and pepperoni and sausage pizza. The dough is fabulous."}
{"text":"The new 'go-to' pizza place, Blaze Pizza has such great potential. After all the pizza is fabulous and consistent. And since you can have them build it your way you should get what you want each time. This is what I come back for, a pizza that is tasty, with a crust that is crunchy and chewy at the same time. 

The other key components of a good restaurant are service and image. It is in these areas that Blaze sometimes falls flat. 

Their service is usually not terrible but is often loose and inefficient, lackadaisical at best. Their robotic employees seem to just go through the motions most of the time, seeming bored and uninterested in the task at hand. They rarely smile or even look at a customer in front of them. Their main focus always seems to be on how quickly they can get you to no longer stand in front of them. I should point out that there are usually a couple of top notch employees on duty, those who smile and are efficient in what they do, in other words the ones who do actually give a hoot about their job. 

Now about the image. The restaurant itself is kept up well and normally meets most customers' expectations. The employees' appearance is quite another story. Blaze seems to pride itself on hiring people who dress like they are still learning that task, with pants hanging below the waist, hats on backwards, plastic beads hanging from necks and arms. Not a big deal right? When you add in all of the tattoos, nose rings, ear discs and other face jewelry it just gives a trashy look to an otherwise beautiful restaurant. At one point the most heavily tattooed female was standing on the food line showing each of her tats to a coworker. 

These issues could be easily fixed by simply having a responsible adult in charge at all times and being a bit more selective in the hiring process."}
{"text":"They burn your pizza most of the time or they are uncooked in the center ! Disappointed in the location that is close to home but so less enjoyable than the one in summerlin ! Will try again one more time maybe at the Galeria one ! Most of the kids working here look so miserable ! Please help"}
{"text":"We received a lot of assistance with our fundraising tonight. The staff was GREAT! The food was awesome! The assistant manager Luke was SO HELPFUL! Thank you BLAZE!"}
{"text":"Came in here for the free pizza they're giving out and was so impressed with the staff! Of course free pizza flyers attracted homeless people, one of whom I was talking to in line. The staff treated him fantastically and he was really happy about it. They were friendly, informative, and happy to serve. Oh and the pizza was great of course :)"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to come here and try this franchaise that came from the US! I walked in - warmly greeted by staff. I have heard about the online order so i placed my order online and then went to the store and picked it up. after i checked in they then fired up my pizza :) I've never selected so many toppings for a pizza before! I used three types of cheese - both mozzarella and parmesan, 4 types of meat (chicken, meatballs, bacon and sausage), +++ vegetables (onion, green peppers, red peppers, zucchini, spinach, mushrooms, roasted garlic, basil, cherry tomatoes) and topped with arugula!

The flat fee of 10.49 plus tax - was a pizza that was SUPER DELICIOUS! this is like my dream pizza - all the toppings i want with a nice thin crust (my fiance loved the crust) and for such a reasonable price!!!! I coudln't believe how good this pizza tasted - i took this pizza fresh out of the oven INTO the subway, back to my home. When i got home i briefly toasted it and omg... it is STILL so good! My fiance laughed at me for taking it all the way back home... but hey, until they have a location uptown... looks like I have to eat the pizza either down there or take it back home :) 

Anyway this is going to become one of my new favourites quickly! I make pizzas at home from scratch regularly, and i have to say it does take a lot of time and effort. however at this price, i might as well come here and get the gourmet pizza that i want without the messy kitchen! :)"}
{"text":"I don't like the concept of fired pizza that ready as a blink of an eye but I wanted to try it out. The guys who make the pizzas was great, fast and very kind. Got my order in less then 4 minutes and i was amazed by how fast it was. I had my doubts, how can pizza that being made in less then 5 minutes can be good? Well, it was nice, crunchy and tasted well but i think that the secret for a good pizza is the baking and the time that you give to it. I think I'll give them another try in one of the following days..."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is incredible!!! Party of 5 and all of our pizzas were delicious!! Steve was so nice and made sure our experience was perfect!!! Worth the drive from Winston-Salem!!!! We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza game is fleeky as hell. Employees are super friendly, the ingredients are of great quality and the lemonade is better than Beyoncé's. I get something different every time I go there and they're always so accommodating, shit is great. Thanks blaze"}
{"text":"Busy and loud. The girl taking orders spoke so softly my boyfriend had to have her repeatedly say things again. 
Compared to Pizza Rev across the street this place is a mess. They didn't change gloves once, not even from going from meat to vegetables. 
Once the pizza is done they just shout out the order where Pizza Rev brings it to the table for you. 
Also all the beer and wine is bottles which I prefer draft. Won't be coming back here with something better so close."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Affordable, fast, friendly staff. Nothing bad to say about this location! So many options to choose from. Will be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"I was brought here by some co-workers and I surprisingly liked it. It's a clean establishment and has friendly employees. Ample parking too. They have a lot of choices when It comes to pizza and you can even design one yourself. The food comes out pretty quickly too. Keep in mind this restaurant is pretty much a fast food place so the pizza itself isn't anything to write home about. Don't get me wrong, it tastes great but just don't come here expecting the best pizza you've ever had. Did I mention they post the calories for each selection and you'll be shocked at how calorie- friendly this place is."}
{"text":"I was on a mission for a vegan & gluten free pizza tonight and the mission was a success! FYI I am not a vegan or suffer from a gluten intolerance. I read on Thursday that this place was opening a location on Durango and was serving free pizza. It was stuck on my mind since then.

I think the business is still pretty new so I give the staff an a-ok. They are immensely staffed. Idk how many pizzas they are cranking out but I can't imagine them lasting too long with the amount of staff they have. There was literally like 15 people working and it really wasn't busy. To their credit though I did think they were all pleasant to interact it. The initial person I came in contact with who asked if it was my first time did a great job explaining their concept and pricing quickly and effectively.

Blazed offers a personal size pizza ranging from $5 for a cheese pizza, $6 for a one topping pizza, or $7 and some change for a pizza with unlimited toppings. It's almost like a chipotle and subway hybrid ordering system. The $7 and some change price point gets you the restaurant's pre-selected pizzas of which you can add additional toppings to or take toppings out from. Has the concept stuck yet?You seriously can put anything on the pizza. They have a large variety of meats, cheeses, and veggies to choose from and the price stays at $8 and some change after tax. Not bad in theory. Was it good? Yes!

So getting vegan cheese ups your price by $2 then the gluten free crust ups your price by another $3. My pizza in the end cost $13 and change. It was about the cost of two of their non gluten free non vegan pizzas. When you put it that way: two pizzas for $14... Not bad! 

After you make your choices they toss your pizza into the oven and cook it for you. It takes about 5 minutes to come out. 

I really liked my pizza. I got the veg out. It was their veggie pizza. I did have to add lots veggies on top of the pre-selected toppings. The gluten free crust was also good. It was almost cracker-like. I told the staff that I don't have a gluten allergy and was just trying it out and they advised me that the crust is thinner and therefore putting too much on it might be a bad idea. Nice tip from the staff. Kudos! 

I liked this place and can't wait to go back. It was clean, the staff was nice, and IMO the price is right. I split my pizza with someone but I definitely would be game to have one all to myself. I would probably not get a gluten free crust or get vegan cheese next time to keep my price low. 

My suggested topping would definitely be the roasted garlic. That would be a great addition to ANY pizza."}
{"text":"Friendly service.
Reasonable prices (~$7-9 per pizza depending on toppings) for a pizza that is a little too big for one person.
I liked the sauce and the super thin crust.
Good selection of varied toppings for build your own pizzas, as well as some suggestions if the toppings are too overwhelming.
Fast. (duh)
A handful of decent pre-made salads....but I wish they made them to order so I could add chicken to the beet salad...for instance.
Nice patio - great place for the kids to do their thing."}
{"text":"It was simple, quick, easy, fast, and affordable! They were friendly and made sure that you felt taken care of... I hope this is their service standard and not just something they're doing for the moment because they are new... Will be back and would recommend it!"}
{"text":"I like the pizzas at Blaze. They're the best of this new quick service pizza fad. They have a cool machine that presses out the dough and leaves a ring for the crust. The sauces are good. I ordered the spicy sauce but it had no heat. It tasted like the classic red sauce. I don't know what happened because the guy making my pizza said it was hot. They have a bunch of toppings you just tell them what you want and you're done. The food is real good I wish there was one closer to where I live."}
{"text":"Faster than ordering a happy meal and awesome quality ingredients on the pizza every time I eat here. From start to finish less than 6 minutes. Great aqua Fresca drinks. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Blaze Fast Fire'd has become my favorite \"Build Your Own\" pizzeria. I'm here so much that you can call BFF my new BFF. And based on the lines that you'll find here, everyone else is a fan too. Your options are almost endless. Want to keep it simple? Then go for their Simple Pie ($5.25), which is just mozzarella, Parmesan, and red sauce. Too boring for you? How about their 1 topping pizza ($6.45)? You can't decide for yourself? Then go with one their Signature Pizzas or a Build Your Own for just $7.95.  I usually choose to build my own and take full advantage of their limitless toppings. My pizza masterpiece consist of just a regular crust, white sauce, no cheese, triple serving of chicken, mushrooms, roasted garlic, and olives. My opinion...it's the best pizza that I have ever created. Obviously, I'm a fan and will be back. 

TIP: Download the app and order your pizza ahead of time. You are welcome."}
{"text":"I have had pizza here a few times, and it is always very good!  However, this time, my problem was the service.  The ice machine was broken, so I asked an employee named \"Rave\" about the machine, the response was \"The machine is broken, it doesn't produce ice and we have to keep refilling it, but the drinks are still cold so\".  The employee continued to have a bad attitude and did not even offer to refund the drink.  However, the manager came by and offered me a refund to which I responded, \"Yes.\"  Overall, I am satisfied with the food, not with the service!"}
{"text":"This pizza will make you forget all your problems. In love with the crust. Its so perfect, I couldn't have dreamt up a better crust. It's perfectly crunchy and has just the right amount of chew. They also have high rise and gluten free. 
Artisan pizza created in front of you with variety of quality toppings. Never had ricotta on pizza but it's pillowy perfection. Fired in pizza oven. Fast, simple, delicious. One price for as many toppings as you want. For drinks they have blood orange lemonade, blueberry hibiscus juice, and matcha agua fresca. I'm in love. 

To recreate my pizza - garlic pesto sauce with marinara dollops, shaved mozzarella, ricotta, goat cheese. 
Put the pepperoni on last so it crisps up. 
Veggies - artichoke, roasted garlic, spinach, roasted red pepper, basil leaves, red onion. 
Finish with arugula after cooked."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Blaze last weekend for the first time. The service was on track and the pizza was amazing!!! The negative reviews must be coming from fired pie employees because Blaze pizza is a better tasting and quality pizza, PERIOD!!!!. The central location was clean and well organized. We had no issues!! Blaze pizza is our choice over fired pie and pieology."}
{"text":"This place is SO WORTH IT. We went in because somehow LeBron is sponsored by this place? (Boyfriend and basketball love I swear) and I just can't ever get enough of pizza. I was just so overwhelmed at the choices, the freshness, the service and the lemonade was realllllllllllyyyy good. 
I love that they tell you the calories of each individual item, and I really appreciate the vegan and gluten free options they have. I am not celiac but every so often I like the idea of trying it out for my celiac friends, if I can try some so they know how good it is why not? I like that this place is right next to the Eaton Centre and it is mostly cheaper to eat here than it is to eat in the food court. They have a pretty good amount of seating, but due to the popularity it can be a bit hard at times. 
S'more pie is really great, very simple but just great when you need something sweet at the end. 
Lastly, I love the fact you can order online and pick up, it just makes things simple when you need to get in and get out. Overall, just an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Not a fan anymore.. $12 for a pizza with 6 pieces of pepperoni and a small hand full of sausage. They cut back on toppings for sure.. next time little Caesars  $7 for a deep dish..  Pizza Rev at least gave more pepperoni.."}
{"text":"Amazingly great! Last time I was there it wasn't as great as every other time , but it was crazy busy ....so I'll keep going unless I see a trend ."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, nice selection of toppings, must like thin crusts. The pizzas were a bit on the pricey side. But the line up moved quickly."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat. The workers are wonderful. The manager Cory, was exceptionally kind and helpful. He greeted us with a smile on his face and made sure that we enjoyed our meal. He offered us ranch and overall made it a wonderful experience. I will definitely be going to this location again."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here & it was sooo worth it! I ordered the Red Vine \"original\" crust (other options were \"thick\" & \"gluten free\"). It was basically a margherita pizza with cherry tomatoes added. It was made in probably close to 7 minutes, just enough time for me to grab my blood orange lemonade! Amazing & super friendly staff...but my pizza...was EXQUISITE!!!! DEFINITELY coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is nuclear! The value and the taste and the flavours of your creation all mixed into one to create a harmony of awesomeness. 

The service was great, especially if its your first time. They helped me order and asked me how my meal went. 

The pizza itself was better than most places I have been to at restaurants.

This place was worth it!"}
{"text":"Grocery store level pizza priced move.

Is that a bad thing? Depends on who you ask. I tried three of their pizza's the other day at a party, which is the type of setting this caters to better than other big chains.

Dough: M'eh. A big too thick for Neapolitan.

Cheese: M'eh. Not horrible, but definitely reinforced the low price.

Sauce: M'eh. I managed to taste the sauce on it's own. It needed salt and/or a big garlic.

So that's pretty much sums up what to expect from their cheese pizza, we also had a Hawaiian and a mushroom & sausage.

Toppings: 
The Hawaiian: Plenty of pineapple, but the Canadian ham slices were too big for such a small pizza. They also had arugula on top which I thought was a nice touch and added a bite of tanginess that the cheese was missing.

Mushroom & Sausage: Really like the sausage on this pizza, really made up for the lack of flavor, not a mushrooms fan, but they weren't that bad.

So, if good, cheap, fast pizza is on your list, then I'd check it out, but if you are looking for a nice sit down meal there are a much better places in the area.

Bonus: They use cornmeal instead of flour for working the dough. Hardly see that out here in Vegas."}
{"text":"So the concept, pizzas, service, prices (excluding the side salad pricing which is stupid) are all 5-star worthy. Chipotle model for pizza. Fabulous ingredients. It's the best of the fast casual concept. BUT JESUS please turn the music down. It's so loud people are literally shouting to talk. Funny because I've literally heard the owner (cool guy) yelling to (not at) another complaining customer that 'it's corporate policy to have it at this level'. Even outside. Please guys, you're killing it, but turn down the effing tunes."}
{"text":"I love the pizzas at blaze and with so many different options, I keep coming back. This location is newer and has worked out a lot of the kinks from when it first opened. I like to mobile order to skip the line so I can get out in 5 minutes after arriving. I like that they don't fire the pizza until you show up because it hasn't been sitting under any heat lamps. Blaze is a good quality pizza for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Wanted pizza but didn't have time to leave work and get one. I ordered a pizza through postmates so I wasn't able to make sure my order was correct. They forgot add two of my requested toppings. So best advice is to order in person."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely magnificent!!!! So cheap for all that you get, and the people are so nice! I love the gluten free crust!"}
{"text":"Have went to Blaze Pizza multiple times and each one is a hit! Basically an unlimited toppings pizza place for around $13 tax included.  It is a bit on the smallish side in terms of diameter but with the amount of toppings you put on it a regular person should be good!

Even on really busy days the line moves so fast you are in and out in 5 minutes

5/5 for me"}
{"text":"Always fresh and fast.  This place follows the same path trail blazed by Subway of customizing your food.  You pick what you want, and out it comes in a few minutes.  Great thin & crispy crust, and great fresh toppings.  The juice options are also awesome too... 

There is a reason this place is always busy.  But the line is never too long (it moves quickly).  Love this place!

*Tip* Although you can put as much topping on it as you want, you probably shouldn't.  When the pizza has too many toppings, it does not come out crispy.  Instead its a soggy droopy mess.  Sometimes more is not always better.."}
{"text":"Great pizza! This place is usually pretty clean. The only complaint I have is that one of the employees (don't know their name) looks very bored and disinterested while making our pizza each time we visit. I suggest ordering the Create-Your-Own pizza for around $8 if you intend to add many toppings. It's a generous size, even for dinner, and I've had to take leftovers home. 
Side note: their $5 Monday deal with the purchase of 2 drinks ends before 5 pm- it's very strict, as the register is programmed to stop allowing the deal at exactly 5 pm, so make sure to get there before then for the deal"}
{"text":"Cool idea...pizza is average at best.  The concept is really neat and executed perfectly...the product and value is just not there.  The line moves really quickly and by the time you pay and pour your drink the pizza is ready.  The toppings are numerous to chose from and fresh.  Where I think it comes up short is the crust...its just too thin.  You can get double crust, it will take longer to cook.  The thing is... having a family of 4 it is too expensive.  I can go to a couple of really good pizza restaurants in Concord that make much better tasting pizza for $10.00 less and feed my family.  This place is great for a quick lunch...but there are much less expensive and better tasting pizza places around."}
{"text":"Quick, easy and delicious! Ordered the red vine which had mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, parmesan, basil and olive oil. Perfectly crisp crust covered with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Constructed in front of you, freshly fired, and all the toppings you could hope for - what else could you want? 
I am obsessed with thin crust pizza, so this place was a real treat. 
I tried the Red Vine and it was fantastic! I like my pizzas on the saucy side, and the tomato sauce definitely did not disappoint. It tasted like fresh home-made tomato sauce - a bit tart, a bit sweet. The mozzarella and fresh basil were impeccable. 

The customer service was great too. I usually don't expect too much from fast casual places, but the staff came up to us several times to make sure we were happy with the food and to clear our table once we were done. 

The size is perfect to share between two people and I think the price is right for the quality, considering it is in a busy downtown location. 

Huge fan!"}
{"text":"Blaze used to be one of my favorite pizza places, but I feel like the food has gone a bit downhill. The staff is always kind, fun, and helpful. The environment is awesome, they play great music, and have accommodations for sitting inside or outside. 
We live in the area and go to Blaze relatively consistently, but the last few times our food was not satisfactory. We got two build your own pizzas to go last night. The dough was floppy and not fully cooked, to the point where we had to put it back in the oven when we got home. We also had to re-cut our own pizzas because the person cutting them didn't slice effectively. Our pizzas have turned out this way the last three times we went to Blaze.
Over all, we continue to return to Blaze in hopes that our experience will be better."}
{"text":"(Disclaimer again: latest visit was during the widely publicized Pi Day promo, with $3.14 pizzas.)

After trying multiple similar \"build your own pizza\" concepts, Blaze Pizza easily remains my favorite.

Other pizzas from Chipotle-esque pizzerias tend to be smaller and not as delicious. Their crusts may be the same diameter or just slightly smaller than Blaze's, but some just are really thin. I just noticed tonight that Blaze's crust is thicker on the end, which I'm sure helps to corral the toppings on potentially massive orders.

That's right, they don't skimp at Blaze Pizza. I've loaded up on toppings at competitors in a similar fashion, but the end results were simply not as big. Although Blaze doesn't have everything, their competitors generally seem to have less interesting toppings. Notable standouts at Blaze include the ovalini mozzarella and goat cheeses, and both roasted and chopped garlic. That aside, all the toppings collectively punch my taste buds harder, and on a consistent basis at that.

They still tend to rush you a bit through the pizza line when it's busy. Just order quickly and clearly, and get all the toppings that you want. Take note that there are a few toppings that are duplicated within the creation line (Italian sausage and pepperoni come to mind), so you'll have a second chance at them just in case you miss them.

I usually craft an order similar to the one detailed in my first review, but I've been meaning to spice it up. I literally did that tonight by asking for the spicy red sauce instead of the regular red sauce. I think it definitely added some flavor while thankfully not providing too much heat. I also omitted cherry tomatoes because of another experience where I thought that the flavors might have been diluted by the juicy tomato slices. Tonight's result showed me that, at the very least, I didn't miss those tomatoes one bit.

I made another awesome observation tonight. Gregg W. mentioned in his review that he requested his own massive construct to be cooked in the oven for longer. The crust on my pizza tonight was firm all the way to the middle, not soggy as I noted in my first review. I think I know why: they adjusted the cooking time on their own. My pizza came out _after_ my friend's, even though he'd been behind me in line the whole time (and yes, his pizza was more modestly decorated). I was leaning toward the five stars anyway due to multiple consistently delicious visits, but this attention to detail sealed the deal.

Misc. notes: they have an app (available on both Android and iOS) that lets you gain rewards. They have online ordering and don't bake those pizzas until you arrive to pick them up. Estimated calorie counts have recently been added to printed menus, in addition to being available on their web site (Nutrition Calculator, under Menu).

Although I haven't completely explored this sub-genre of pizza, I'm not sure what it would take for me to find a new favorite. I've found that the bar for quantity, quality, and service set by Blaze Pizza is very high. I've heard that they're planning to open another location even closer to me, and I'm waiting eagerly. Ecstatically, even."}
{"text":"(SAME DISCLAIMER AS LAST TIME: I visited during a free pizza promotion that was widely publicized on social media, external web sites, etc. They required that I \"Like\" them on Facebook, then stamped my hand with red ink before letting me through.)

I was shocked when I drove by this former Schlotzky's Deli earlier this week to see how finished the new Blaze Pizza looked. Then they announced their grand opening on Friday and I was ecstatic.

I've been a huge fan of this particular pick-your-own-pizza-toppings chain since my free visit and through my multiple paying visits to the \"original\" location of Blaze Pizza in Henderson near Eastern and St. Rose. I've been giddy with anticipation ever since they announced their second location on the outer edge of the Galleria Mall Ring Circle, which is much closer to home. So of course I rushed over right after work to stand in what I figured would be a ridiculously long line.

After about 80 minutes just to start the ordering process, I was pumped. I started by indicating that I wanted a Build Your Own Pizza (normally $7.95), because I was definitely going to load my regular crust up (unlike many of the unimaginative people I saw around me). As I worked through the line, I indicated my choices of finishes (pesto and arugula - and yes, at the start of the line), sauce (spicy red), cheeses (shredded mozzarella, ovalini mozzarella, ricotta, goat), meats (Italian meatballs, chicken, pepperoni, applewood bacon), and veggies (mushrooms, sauteed onions, red onions, fresh basil, red peppers, roasted garlic, oregano). A quick cursory stop at the cash register later and I was ready to wait for just a few more minutes (give or take some rookies handling the finishing station).

The pizza was great, as I'd expected of Blaze Pizza. Bold flavors everywhere. You can distinguish the taste of everything except perhaps the chicken. The crust was fine, although it didn't stay crisp through to the middle. That might change as the employees in charge of the oven learn to leave topping-heavy pies in the oven for a long period of time, which I'm convinced was the case at my last Blaze visit..

Yes, I'm starting off at four stars at this location again. Despite the natural flavor enhancement known as waiting a long time, there were some valleys of blandness among my last two slices, and I attribute some of that to the uneven spreading of the spicy red sauce that I closely observed while in line. The cheeses may also not have been distributed evenly. More issues that may be resolved over time.

I'm very confused about their layout though. The formal line starts in the middle of the store, not on the side. There isn't much room for a queue here, whereas starting the line next to the wall lets people stand in a location that will minimally block foot traffic. Are they not anticipating huge lines within the store during peak hours in the future? Are they always going to designate a doorperson to direct people? This is not something that can easily be fixed.

Regardless of the various issues, I'm sure I'll be a regular at this Blaze Pizza. It's convenient for locals like me and for anyone who happens to be around Galleria or Sunset Station for whatever reason, and it's way better than that another Chipotle-esque pizza spot across the street."}
{"text":"Blaze is a great option for quick pizza. I love the 'build your own' option, as my husband and I normally don't agree on pizza toppings. I like that you can customize your sauce, because oddly enough, I don't care for red sauce. So if you're like me you can opt for the alfredo sauce or the pesto base. You can also add seasoning and a sauce drizzle to your pizza after it exits the oven. I always get a buffalo and ranch drizzle on my pizza and then I don't have to dip it. I like that you can see the pizzas cook and the house made drinks and teas are really wonderful. The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because I wish they had appetizers. I love breadsticks or having something to go with my pizza so hopefully soon they'll add more items to the menu. Great place though!"}
{"text":"So this was our second time at a Blaze Pizza, but our first at the location nearest our home.  The servers are very friendly and make a point to say your name at every station.  The bake the pizzas right in front of you in a large open fired oven.  I ordered the red vine which is super delicious, basil, cherry tomatoes and mozzarella balls.  It is a bit crowded but he line moves quickly.  My only complaint and it's not really a complaint is that the inside dining room does get rather loud.  Fortunately it was cool enough to sit outside so we enjoyed our pizza's there! Where Luke came and asked if we needed anything!  Super friendly place!"}
{"text":"This would be 5 stars except that it is very noisy in the restaurant. The pizza is the old fashion Italian style with light cheese and thin crust.  It is an assembly type of ordering, and they talk to you using your name.  I had the Green Stripe which has pesto on it and it was Delicious.  The staff very friendly and is not priced to high."}
{"text":"The pizza, and majority of the staff are really good. However, do not order online for pickup! I tried ordering ahead because I was stuck for time, and I ended up waiting longer than I would've had I just waited in line. The pizza is supposed to be made and just waiting for the oven. In my case, my pizza was sent to the back of the line when I showed up to \"check in,\" 5 minutes before my pizza was supposed to be finished, because no one had made it yet. It wasn't crowded at the time I was there, either. Not to mention, my toppings were few and far between! I'm assuming this is because I wasn't peering at them through the glass as they made it, like I've been before when the toppings were much more generous. I will certainly be back for more pizza, just never ordering online again."}
{"text":"Wow! We finally ventured to Blaze and we weren't disappointed. I went with the Veg with vegan cheese. I was so happy they had a non-diary option! The crust was perfect...thin and a bit crispy. My husband and children enjoyed their pizzas as well. We look forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now. I like the concept of building your own pizza and cooked fresh right there. There are tons of tables. The black cherry soda they have is the bomb. The only thing about this place is the food doesn't stick with you. I was hungry again just a couple of hours later. The store is located in a busy area just south of Target. The parking lot is cramped. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Walked in and was treated with a \"what do you want,\" tried to order and the man who was supposed to be taking my order shook his head saying no and walked away. I looked to my friend and said we should have gone to the chipotle next door and the man, Ryan, said goodbye to us. As we were walking out he told us to come back, which I did to let him know his guest service skills were horrible and he should find a new occupation, then proceeded to chipotle. Ryan ruined my mood for the night and definitely shouldn't be working in an environment where he is supposed to be helping others."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places. 
They've got vegan cheese and fake \"chicken\". 
Lots of options for toppings too. Basil, two types of garlic...
Nice patio to sit at (with your dog)"}
{"text":"- On my first time visited here, I have tried custom pizza as recommended. They offered a huge selections of toppings and sauces, I do recommend getting red sauce instead of white (I have tried both sauces, each on half side of the pizza) just because red sauce was more flavourful. They did give generous amount of meat and vegetables. Freshly baked, crispy dough, overall very well done.
- Portion: if you're extremely hungry, then one pizza is enough for only one person. If you're looking for afternoon snacks, then one pizza can feed up to two people. 
- Price: about $12 after tax for a custom pizza (I remember most pizzas are around this price as well). Pricey for a small sized pizza. 
-  Place was not too small but not too big, usually no lineup as I walk by there everyday to school.
- Excellent customer service 
- Will I come back? probably not, I thought the pizza was good but not something that surprised me and It's a bit expensive too. I think all pizzas are not healthy whether or not you go for gluten-free or put huge amount of veggies on it, so might as well go for a cheaper version (pizza pizza) and save money for fresh vegetables."}
{"text":"Had lunch there and ordered the \"Artful\" pizza with artichokes, ricotta and red sauce. The crust was burned on the bottom which ruined the taste of the entire pizza. Very disappointed. My side salad, that I ordered with \"light\" dressing, was swimming in the salad dressing. Salad was fresh, but taste was ruined by too much salad dressing. They need to re-think their approach and the way they make the pizzas."}
{"text":"This new pizza place is definitely going to be a local favorite! Today was the opening day. We stopped here for lunch. It was moderately busy, the staff was fantastic, friendly, and they made me smile with their humor and their great big smiles. 
They have a build your own option for $7.95, and do not charge extra for toppings which is awesome! They offer gluten free crust for $2.00 more. The crust is not frozen, but freshly made, you can actually see it being made right there :).
I had the gluten free crust, and chose the classic red sauce, mozzarella cheese, Italian sausage, black olives and onions. They have oodles of toppings to choose from. The pizza is then put in the oven where it is cooked by open fire. You find a seat, and they call you up when your pizza is ready. I felt the music was a tad bit loud, as it was hard to hear the guy who was calling out names. My pizza was fantastic, the flavor was amazing. I did feel the gluten free crust was soggy, but it did not stop me from enjoying the pizza yumminess! 
The decor is modern, and the place is clean. They offer bottled drinks and fountain drinks, and will soon be offering beer and wine. 
I can say that my husband and I will be back to Blaze, and I can't wait to try many different pizza varieties! Great job Blaze!!"}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza. Could it get any worse? I have had Chicago pizza, New York Pizza, Italian style pizza. But what style is Blaze Pizza? Not sure. Blaze Pizza popped up in Henderson and became one of the most overrated pizza places. There are constant fundraisers for needy high schools to try and suck up every last penny they can get as if they don't get enough from taxes. There's Dominos and Papa Johns which are the lower class pizza places but not terrible. Then there's Blaze Pizza. Basically the McDonalds of pizza places. Horrible quickly crafted style pizzas. And the building? Could you have more cameras in here it's as if you are partnered with the FBI. When you pull into blaze be prepared for a huge line of people usually coming out of the door. Once you finally make your way inside you are greeted with loud music and still, a line. Why is this place bad if there is such a long line. Bandwagon and people giving this place another chance after their horrible first visit.

Be greeted by an assembly line of almost factory workers creating your pizza where they overprice their pizza and make it a mission to hold a conversation with you. Do you hate onions? Well guess what? That last worker touched onions all over and now is putting your tomatoes on with the same gloves. Your pizza tastes a lot like onions? All thanks to that worker. How is it not breaking FDA rules not switching gloves each customer. The pizza is poorly crafted on some thin trashy dough and put on with a classic red sauce. Red is a color not a flavor. I have never seen anyone try and do this but blaze. They vary with the amount of cheese they put on every time so you can never get the pizza you want. The sausage is terrible and I don't recommend it to anyone. Last time I had it I ended up finding some cold pieces of undercooked sausage and it was not fun. Blaze pizza brings a \"throw back\" to the American Revolution. Have your factory workers make you the worst slice of pizza you have ever had. I really hope that Blaze goes out of business soon because I am tired of people bringing it up and following the bandwagon of thinking this place is actually good. If you want good pizza go to Grimaldis or Metro. Shaking my head Blaze."}
{"text":"I went to a Blake up in Garner, NC and was so happy when I saw one pop up on the Queen City.  My 2 kids are pizza addicts so where better to take them on a Saturday for lunch?  

This location seems to be up and coming and there was plenty of bustle going on.  Walked in and as I explained to my family, this is like a Subway for pizza.  Pick the base and walk down the line.  Everyone working there was super friendly and since it's new they took their time to explain everything to you.  I went with the white pizza, add grilled onions and roasted garlic.  Very tasty.  My oldest daughter has celiac and we were happy to know they offer a gluten free crust, they also take the care to wipe everything down when they press the dough which was much appreciated.  3 pizza's, 4 drinks were right at $36.00 (Gluten free adds a bit).

Great concept and good place for a quick bite.  I will say one negative, and the music inside was so darn loud!!  Maybe I'm just getting old :-)"}
{"text":"Decent price, order comes quickly, lots of selection, great quality and taste - that's a recipe for success in my books. This might be basically fast food but it sure is good. Decent amount of seating despite its central location in the downtown core, which is nice. Only complaint: the drink selection is a little bit lacking."}
{"text":"They have the best spicy red sauce and very friendly staff. 
Everything else similar to other pizza chains.. like their lemonades"}
{"text":"This, this is the pizza you've been waiting for...simplicity in deliverance, complexity in choices, and tasty tasty ingredients. Blaze won't disappoint you, even if you don't know how to make a pizza.

Unlimited toppings, that's the whole point of Blaze, the experience starts with them starbucking it, and asking for your name while explaining you the menu and choices if you've never been here before. Oh, and the pizzas are priced aggressively for what you're getting. The second station will ask you for your toppings and sauces, in which they offer the flexibility of getting multiple sauces combined, divided, or omitted completely from your pizza. The toppings are plentiful, with top notch ingredients such as artichokes, roasted garlic, and pesto, as well as an assortment of proteins. Then you wait as they cook your pizza in their giant pizza oven. Once the fresh pizza comes out of the oven, you can continue to top it off with arugula, olive oil, and sauces such as BBQ. The outcome of this, is an incredibly delicious pizza that you're proud of making yourself, and regardless of what you put on it, it will taste amazingly fresh and flavourful.   

And thats it! There's not much else to Blaze, but it's sheer simplicity in it's process can lead to a pizza that tastes better than most pizza joints in town. Sometimes the simple things can lead to an incredibly fulfilling experience, and Blaze clearly nails it with it's name."}
{"text":"I am a fool for Blaze. The pizza is delicious and fast and you can add as many topics as you want - what's not to like?! I went in expecting it to be too good to be true. I thought I'd keep asking for toppings and then the other shoe would drop and I'd get cut off. Not even close! I think I'd get tired of asking for toppings before these guys got tired of piling them on. I wish they'd open up a location in the Annex!"}
{"text":"First off the pizza was delicious. The low rating is for the dirty restaurant (not one table was clean), the rude bossy manager (old blond women) and the super stingy toppings. They have a better selection of toppings than other pizza places like this but when we were there they were scrapping the bottom of all the containers. It was 2pm on a Saturday so still fairly busy even after the lunch rush, there were at least 8 employees standing around behind the toppings bar so why no one was filling it or cleaning is beyond me. The manager was just standing there telling the employees not to put too much of whatever on the pizzas. My husbands pizza had barely any cheese, when he asked for more she picked up like 3 pieces and sprinkled it on there. Even though the food was good it's doubtful we'll be back, Pieology is just as good and always clean, plus the salad selection at Pieology is much better and fresher."}
{"text":"Overpriced if you don't order a lot of toppings (think it's all you can eat toppings) small thin crust pizza. Good for a quick lunch. Make sure to get the most out of your money and choose as many toppings as you want. Pretty fresh ingredients. Quick service."}
{"text":"Fast food pizza is an interesting concept. And to charge one price for any toppings you would like is even better. Yes, this is an interesting concept and rather well executed too.

I recieved a coupon in the mail the other day offering a free pizza. No tricks. No gimmicks. No bait and switch. Just strait up free pizza. I had to take advantage of that as did the people in front of me too. I was worried it would be for just a simple cheese pizza but they said I could get aything. Well, not being one to pass up an offer like that, I went with a BYO (build your own) pizza. 

At Blaze, you select your toppings and the staff puts your pizza together. Much like Subway, Five Guys and Chipotle. For my pizza I asked for spicy red sauce, shredded mozzarella, meatballs, salami, kalamata olives, roasted garlic and mushrooms. I walked down the line with the pizza up to the cashier and presented my coupon. I ordered a drink and paid for that as my pizza went into the over with gorgeous visable flames. They say it takes 180 seconds to cook. That seems about right. My pizza was ready and my name was called in less than 5 minutes.

One bite in and I had already burned my mouth. Fresh out of the oven pizza will do that to you. That initial bite, despite being very hot, was delicious. Ths spicy red sauce was just hot enough to make me sweat but not cause me to spontaneously combust. The meatballs didn't add much as they had been broken apart but they did not detract from the pizza either. The salami was a nice alternative to pepperoni. The kalamata olives added a nice bright brinieness (is that a word?). The garlic was just a wonderful aromatic addition. The toppings all worked together to create a beautiful symphony.

The folks at Blaze have pizza making nearly down to a science. They have a dough roller that makes the perfect sized balls ready to turn into crust. They trim the crusts to make the perfect and consistent size. They have spoons for the sauces. Spoons for the cheese. Everything is very controlled and structured. Maybe almost too structured. All the care they take to make sure everything is perfect every time slows up the line just a little bit. On the other hand, this shows the care the take and the pizza is representitive of that. My pizza today was free no doubt to get me in there and try it in hopes that I would come back again as a paying customer. Mission accomplished. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Yum! Love this place. My favorite is the white top with added ham and mushrooms. The crust is delicious. Thin and crispy. I love that you can get as many toppings as you want for no extra cost. The blood orange lemonade is so good too!"}
{"text":"While blaze has the potential to be tasty, the fact that it is consistently burnt and poorly cut give the reasons for 3 stars. I find it very difficult to eat a pizza with burnt crusts AND a burnt bottom. I would expect more consistency in the future to achieve a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"'Bout time a pizza joint like this came closer. Similar to the Pieology Concept, Blaze is a convent, clean, friendly pizza place. Walked in and there's a good line, but they are well organized and keep the line moving at a steady pace. You pick your pizza from the menu (or can customize it), and like Subway or Chipotle, you walk down the line and tell them what you'd like on your pizza. At the end it's 180 seconds for them to wood fire your pizza to golden, black crusted yumminess.  A pizza is $7.95, cheese only $5, and they are about the size of a small pizza, so two kids or light eaters could definitely share a pizza. They have a few different salads likes green, Caesar, and a tomato-mozzarella-basil. They also have these cute smore pies ($2) that they warm up by the fire. 
The 2 owners were there and they along with the general staff were some of the friendliest people in the food and service industry I've encountered in awhile. 
We'll be back, fo' sho."}
{"text":"Great customer service and large portions. The pizza could easily be shared amongst two people. The crust isn't the best, but overall a good place for lunch or a casual dinner."}
{"text":"This is ridiculous amazing. Back in Cali we had 
\" pieology \" 
And if you guys are familiar with that place it's exactly the same. 
I'm in love with it to be honest. 
Building your own pizza with them is fun and no limits. You can explore everything you want to for one price. No additional topping cost while i Love because I'm a supreme kind of girl but always with the EXTRAS lol!!! 
Their pizza tastes really fresh and it's not over cooked or undercooked. It's so perfect. I mean i put extra cheese on it and wasn't charged. Anybody who loves cheese like i do understand how important this can be aha. Extra cheese without paying another dollar or change is amazing. I rather eat this pizza than those nasty ass chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Our new Favorite Lunch spot. The pizza is great and the prices are even better. If you eat on the light side you can share a pizza no problem. Strawberry Fresca beverage is on point as well."}
{"text":"I was here on a Thursday night and had to wait over an hour for a pizza.  They didn't seem to care about the long line and I even saw an employee leave on break at 6:45pm with the long line.  When I worked at McDonald's (many moons ago) if I left on break with even 2 people in line my boss would have chewed me out.  Not here, they don't care about their customers or their time."}
{"text":"Well when we first came here we loved it. Many options gluten free  choices and a pick your own toppings kind of pizza bar. We did a togo order here one day and it was all wrong so I had a bad taste since then but we are giving it another try. Although the girl at the register was a little rude and acted as if everything i was asking was annoying her.  It makes me not want to come back even if the food is good.. so giving it another chance because my son loves this place. I won't say I wouldn't come back but maybe they could work on being a little more friendly. The manager is a doll! Sweet as pie and her customer service is amazing."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff for the most part.  I have never had a bad experience here so far."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Postmates, a Caesar salad, garlic knots & margarita pizza.
The salad wasn't super fresh & crisp, not enough dressing on it for the container it came in. Most Caesar's are pre tossed, this was not. The garlic knots said they come with marinara and pesto, I didn't receive either of these with my order. The pizza itself was decent, cold but I ordered delivery, so what do I expect?! I put it in the oven for a few. 

I keep trying to find a pizza that compares with Balboa's & the truth is, I haven't found anything as good."}
{"text":"We came based on Yelp reviews. We arrived and saw there were about 12 people in line, but seemed to be moving fast.  First thing I noticed is the place is LOUD. The entire room is designed with flat noise reflecting surfaces. That plus the big man handing out the pies at the end of the line is screaming people's names at the top of his lungs. Unnecessary loud. The pizza was good, fairly typical of the Chipotle style pick your topping pizza. We will probably not return based on the big guy bellowing names and making everyone else try to yell over him. Too much of a distraction to try and enjoy a meal. Would not recommend unless you like uncomfortably loud restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Fresh, creative, and delicious! I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Never a shortage of pizza places, we tried Blaze for lunch last week. They're fairly new and we got a free pizza coupon in the mail, always a good incentive. I ordered the veg-out pizza and replaced zucchini with black olives and we also ordered the Artist and the BBQ chicken pizzas. 

This pizza joint has a menu of creations which we all ordered. They seem to limit you on toppings so we figured getting a pizza with several toppings is a a better deal. They held up well going home and I enjoyed my pizza as well as the chicken one. I liked the red sauce drops, thought it wouldn't be enough sauce but it was just right. The artist had ricotta cheese on it, which didn't work for me. Pizza tasted good reheated the next day too, a good sign. 

I am a fan of unlimited toppings, so next time I'll try a different spot but I did like this place and the surrounding area. Lots of pizza competition makes it tough to stand out."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. How fun. You pick your own toppings in an assembly line and then they bring them out to you. Such a great way to get a thin crust personal pizza. Such a great toppings bar too. I did try their salads too. Good stuff. If you have kids, they'll love it. If you guy for lunch, expect it to be busy."}
{"text":"Noisiest restaurant without TV's that I have ever been in. Had to shout to get my order heard. But that was ok. The pie however was not.  While I like super thin crusts I prefer they actually have taste. I ordered simple pepperoni and cheese and frankly it had little flavor. I could not even taste the pepperoni.  Very bland. Had the arugula with fruit side salad and it was pretty good.  First time I ever wanted to salt a pizza in my life. Alas, I could find no salt anywhere. Sorry Blaze @University, I was hopeful."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!

First off, let me just say that I'm not even that big of a pizza fan. But this place is BOMB. I love how you can make your own pizza and select as many toppings as you want. They also aren't stingy about layering your toppings either. The pizza crust also isn't too thick and is just the right amount. 

It's such a great place for a chill hangout and to grab a quick bite. I am a huge fan and would definitely be coming back! 

Some tips: ask for a cup so you can fill it up with water for free. Be prepared to get cozy - there aren't a lot of seats so you'll be up close to your neighbours. If you can't finish, you can ask for a take out box so don't feel the need to stuff yourself."}
{"text":"Overpriced and only ok pizza. Ordered on their website for take-out, pick-up was easy and fast."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge - 2018 # 67

Who would love a customizable pizza. Yum!

I visited this location on a Thursday afternoon and they were pretty busy. This was my first time at this location but not at a Blaze.

This Blaze is located in a shopping plaza by Canes and In N Out. There is plenty of open parking so no need to worry about parking.

There is both an indoor and outdoor eating area, so if the weather is nice you can eat wherever. On my visit it was pretty busy. I would say that there were about 8 people in front of me but it took no time. 

Order:
I order the meat eater with italian sausage instead of meatballs and mushrooms instead of red onions. I also ordered a yummy chocolate chip cookie. 

They offer beer, soda, and water so if you want to sit down and enjoy your delicious customized pizza then you can. 

I'm a Fan of Blaze!"}
{"text":"My boys always prefer blaze as to any other pizza place . Last night it was my sons 13th bday . He had a pick of any restaurant or buffet  here in Vegas and he chose Blaze . My big boys ordered what they usually order , my little guys had fun picking their toppings and hubby chose a meat pizza with banana peppers . I chose a thinker crust as opposed to all my guys and I chose the veggie pizza but added artichokes , olives , spinach , bell peppers and roasted garlic. Mine was yummy . I just had two slices probably because I chose the thicker crust it was more filling . Even my 6 year old almost finished his whole pizza!  Now I know why my big boys  like it so much . Oh and get the blood orange lemonade . Couldn't get enough of it !!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time MOD or Fired Pierre is better.  No one in line and service  was slow and not personal.  Ordered 2 pizzas and a salad took 5 minutes to get through the line and had a coupon for buy 1 get 1 free and 3 drinks, $32 questioned the bill and was told that's it, had to resolve with the manager slowly.  Good salad mediocre pizza.   Get your money back LaBron."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. The pizza is awesome. It reheats well the next days in case you have some leftovers. Their lemonades and other fruity drinks are delicious too. The workers here are great with great customer service. Every time we come we see customers who are too picky and not clear with what they want and the employees are always professional and patient."}
{"text":"Got a coupon for a free pizza in the mail so we thought we'd try it out. This place is pretty amazing... It's like chipotle but for pizza! They have 8 signature pizzas you can choose from or you can make your own. What's great is they don't charge per topping and no limit on how many you can get! They have a huge selection on toppings and sauces... Also this place is good for vegans. They have gluten free dough and vegan cheese. This place is great!"}
{"text":"For a quick and fresh pizza, this place is awesome.
The staff has always been friendly and helpful with the walking customers through the process and making a custom pizza.
Each pizza is a fairly large portion with generous toppings, all of which are a standard price regardless of how the pizza is customized, and their blood orange lemonade is great."}
{"text":"If I were a freshman at Ryerson University, I would instantly gain the Freshman 15. 

If you haven't been, and I showed you my pizza. you'd estimate it would be $15+, but really it was under $12 + tax.  All the ingredients were fresh, and the only problem I had with this place, was being too ambitious with my stack of toppings. If you're not feeling creative, there's signature pizzas that you can choose from. Staff were really friendly.  Lots of seating inside.  Service was also fast and efficient.  There are also occasional deals for students. If you don't have time to wait in line, you can order online or on their mobile app.

 Seriously worth it for all the fresh and unlimited ingredients on your pizza.  Remember not to wear tight fitting pants when you go!"}
{"text":"Love the staff!!!!! They are the friendliest bunch of ppl I've come across at a fast food spot! Kris, Eboni and pretty boy Mike rock. We come at least once a week just to see them"}
{"text":"Food was great but not going back here any time soon. Ordered online and was told that the coupon I got for buy one get one wouldn't work because they already did the transaction for the order. Saying \"you can use it next time\" is pretty dumb.  Apparently coupons they give don't work with the app. 
Also at the counter when talking to guests you need to be louder than the music and the other guests."}
{"text":"This pizza place is great! I love that ask the pizzas are the same price regardless of the topping quantities! Best part ever they have gluten free crust which is only $2 extra!  They have friendly staff and a clean environment! They are quick and each pizza is made fresh!"}
{"text":"This place is has been opened for a couple months.They gave away free pizzas for the grand opening so I decided to wait until the hype died down before trying it out. Good location in South End right on the corner of Camden and East Blvd. I ordered the White Top. The pizza good, cooked to order...waited five mins or so; crispy crust and premium ingredients. It wasn't the best pizza I've ever eaten but it wasn't the worst either. It was just okay I guess."}
{"text":"Unlimited toppings for eight dollars!  I was very surprised at how tasty the sausage is and actually found a new cheese thanks to a customer.  Although I asked for extra crispy, the crust was still soggy"}
{"text":"Incredible pizza joint. Delicious, fresh, and unlimited toppings!!! Being at one of the busiest intersections,  at the corner of Yonge & Dundas outside the 10 Dundas building by Ryerson, this place has to be fast and super efficient to handle the many people that come in. And they do! I was surprised how efficient they have the process down and ensuring your happy with your pizza as it's being made. They blood orange lemonade was so refreshing as well. It was so fresh and not sugary or overly sweet. Definitely worth a try. The s'mores pie was yummy too. Please open more locations, especially in the surrounding cities (Brampton, Vaughan and Mississauga!)... :-)"}
{"text":"This is some delicious pizza, I love all of the toppings they offer for many types of palets. The service is fast and friendly. There original crust is thin and crispy just the way i like it, but they also offer a thicker crust and a gluten-free crust as well. If you love pizza you should definitely put this on your list of places to try! Oh yeah one more thing. Their brownie is so very bad meaning amazing!"}
{"text":"So this is the Chipotle of Pizza and I love it! Lots of fresh ingredients and sauces. Perfect lunch spot with quick service! Pick you crust, cheese,  sauce and unlimited toppings for 1 low price, who can beat that. Then they put it in a wood fired grill, I mean I really love this place and beverages are delicious also! I just might go get some today."}
{"text":"I was kind of unimpressed when I saw a pizza place open up in yonge and dundas square because I already love amato pizza and pizzaiolo but I was intrigued when I saw the giant line ups when it first opened. I was even more intrigued when I read all of the good reviews so I thought I had to give it a try. I was blown away! 

I opted for the art lover pizza and was kind of confused when they just asked me what I wanted as my pizza went down the line. Glad I just built my own pizza however because it was sooo good. Spicy tomato sauce and ricotta cheese are MUST HAVES. As a spicy food lover, most of the time when restaurants say something is spicy I do not even detect a hint of spice, but this sauce was quite impressive. 

The entire process didn't take too long. My pizza came out fresh tasting with a crispy thin crust. I enjoyed the excellent customer service. I hate when I go into places that have a certain system to ordering and paying but no one tells you where to go. That did not happen here. Every step of the way I was told where to go and all the staff were extremely friendly. 

This place definitely has 5 star potential. I will be back for more pizza."}
{"text":"Well, they're awfully close and folks seem to like it but I won't be back. Only reason for trying out the place was due to friends at the brewery run club saying they were good AND they had a buy one get one. 

The blank look on the cashier's face and her utter unwillingness (or perhaps utter inability?) to fix my bill will not get me back or get me to recommend this place. 

Libretto's and Pure Pizza both have great pizzas and great service. Why go to a chain that does not give AF?"}
{"text":"Modern take on the build your own pizza experience that is fast becoming a staple name in the industry. Having been to the location in Ames, IA several times prior to moving here, I felt it was time to give a justly review of the place. 

Service: Employees at this location were friendly, but working quickly as we came during the lunch hours. Pizzas were handled with care.  Took about 10 minutes to get our food from the time we walked in the door. Nothing bad to say in this department.

Selection: This location offered all the same toppings/salads/desserts as the one in Ames. Build Your Own is still the best bang for your buck in my opinion at $8.50. 

Taste: The only gripe I've ever had with the place is the inconsistency in how the pizza is fired. Sometimes it will be undercooked or overcooked. It was perfectly fired this time around. Everything tasted fresh. The ingredients they use here are delicious for what you pay. 

Price: Can get a little expensive once you begin adding in sides or a drink. I suggest signing up for their email rewards as they frequently will entice you to come back in with buy one, get one offers. 

Overall: Pretty satisfied, this place upholds the experience well enough."}
{"text":"Absolutely best experience getting late night pizza with my boyfriend! Staff was amazing and so kind. Yal should give the night crew a raise tho..  haha definitely coming back for seconds and thirds and more :)"}
{"text":"Came in to order pizza on a Saturday night and they're out of sauce how??? Went home with no pizza  what a waist of my time. True sign of poor management if they can't be prepared for weekends. How???"}
{"text":"The place was pretty busy but there was no line. We were able to order our pizza ok but when we went to the registers to pay, one of the workers was taking coffee orders for Dutch Bros. from the other staff and we had to interrupt her and ask if we could pay. The register area was filthy with pizza droppings but the staff didn't seem to care. We then watched our pizza \"liners\" get placed on top of this mess. When I saw my pizza coming up I popped up just before she plopped my pizza on the liner that had been sitting in the counter filth. I asked for a new liner and the pizza cutting girl seemed exacerbated, but did go get us new liners. The pizza quality was mediocre at best but the cleanliness of the store and service of the staff is the real reason I'll never return. Beware."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Service is very slow heat they advertise fast serve. Would be a great spot and food is good but management and workers seems to be standing around despite people in line"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this Zero stars. Was my first time trying blaze and was excited one just opened up close to my work. Ordered through the app to pick it up. First off, since signing up you receive a reward for a free drink. The woman at the register had no idea what she was doing. Scanned my coworkers app then when we asked for the drink she said we needed to show her we had the reward.... this was within 30 seconds. Did she forget we literally just showed her? Or is she just that stupid? We ordered 3 pizzas. Two were completely wrong and one wasn't even cut. Fuck this place. My pictures show what I ordered and what they gave me. Thanks for putting bacon on my pizza. What if I had been a vegetarian? We didn't check to make sure they were right because we were on our lunch break and were in a hurry. Bad mistake. Tried to call the store and the phone line wasn't working. Called the main office and was told the supervisor wasn't in. If I wasn't working I'd go back and demand a refund. This place is garbage."}
{"text":"Knowing I was going here for dinner got me through the day. Several of these build your own pizza places are popping up but this spot is my fav. My go to is basically the meat lovers with typical meats and It comes with red onions. Maybe add bacon or garlic from time to time but I don't get too crazy with the toppings. The key is get the spicy marinara!! Yes, get the spicy marinara and you will be thanking me.  I crave this magical sauce. My recent visit I even got extra sauce :)  For a drink I go with the famous blood orange lemonade. Worth getting that for sure. They also have beers if you want a beer with your pie. I will opt for that sometimes but hard not to get the lemonade.The staff and management are super friendly.  These pizzas cook fast so between the efficient staff and oven they can move the line quickly. Added benefit was yesterday they ran a special for 4 bucks a pie after 4. I got there early enough to avoid the line but saw it getting long as we left. 4 bucks is amazing but even at the reg 7sh dollars still very much worth it. It is large enough for leftovers but I typically crush the whole thing there. Remember I love the spicy marinara.  Will be coming back here again and again."}
{"text":"Two years later and it's still a hit! I've switched to gluten free and plant based, and was not disappointed. The staff is friendly and personable- actually and genuinely engaging, not robotic. I appreciate that as a human. You get exactly what you ask for, it's all done right in front of you. And they have an online calorie counter. You just plug in your dough, sauce, and toppings and it calculates all the nutritional information for you. Love that! 
It's always clean inside, well stocked and even the busy times move fast. 
I can't eat this very often, but it's certainly a treat and pleasure when I do."}
{"text":"My newest favorite pizza place!! Pizza was delish! Location is great and everyone was awesome!! Love the portion and variety of drinks available! Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"best pizza in Las Vegas NV, its one of those pizza place were you build your own and cook in a wood fired oven as you wait, there are also well drinks variety including blood orange and tropical flavors(good to the last drop) price wise $, highly recommended, I wish they would offer a franchise, I will be in line to get into it. Try it don't take my word for it. Bon Appetite"}
{"text":"I love this pizza place, they were very nice and had I had my order in no time, the next time I come to Nevada I will definitely be eating here again! :)"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I do like this place! I had take out today for myself and it was damn good! really quick way to order and waited only a couple of minutes for my pizza. They ran out of boxes but they used two smaller ones and that worked out just fine. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot eat pizza anywhere else now! Love the customization, however, plan on waiting awhile should you arrive during prime lunch and dinner times."}
{"text":"I would go everyday! I absolutely loved blaze pizza.  I can't believe it took me this long to try it, and I'm so happy I did. I went to blaze pizza on a late Friday afternoon it was pretty busy when I walked in, there was a line at the door but there was still plenty of tables to sit down at. I was a little bit overwhelmed because it was such a fast pace environment but when I walked to the front to order the staff was super friendly and explained how everything worked. You basically can put as much toppings as you want on your pizza for $10.95or $11.95 I'm not 100% sure I forgot LOL. I got a customized Pizza and I ordered a veggie pizza that they had on the menu already. The pizza was so delicious I really recommend the pesto sauce it was so tasty. 

I can't wait to come back to blaze Pizza again!!"}
{"text":"Vegan options woohoo! I love custom building my vegan pizza and love that the employees are conscious of using separate pizza cutters and ask if you want them to change gloves. Service is wonderful, pizza is quick and delicious. No extra fee for vegan cheese is awesome."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. It's like a subway for pizza. My daughters are really picky so it's nice that they can pick their own toppings."}
{"text":"I love Blaze! It's got high quality, single person-sized pizzas. The pizza here doesn't make me feel gross afterwards like most pizza does. The service is always great! Most times that I've been here there's been an older man who may be the owner serving the pizzas and coming around to the tables to ask how we are doing. This is my favorite place to eat pizza!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of pizza in Charlotte and I'm telling you. For real. This is the best I've had. Here's what works for this place:

pick your sauce pick your cheese pick your toppings. as a vegetarian, i was very happy with the offerings. even had zucchini as a choice! if fake cheese is your thing, they have vegan cheese! 

size of the pie was good for me. gave me 6 decent slices on a thin crust which was perfectly crisp and very very tasty! hard to get a crispy crust most times when you order an all vegetable pizza. didn't feel bloated or unclean when I finished it either! 

place was very clean. plenty of seating. great piped in music. the staff was remarkably friendly and genuine. pizza was just over $7 with tax. great deal! 

what doesn't work for this place? you not being there every day like i would like to be! HA!

I'm definitely come back LOTS and LOTS!"}
{"text":"'Meh' sums up my feelings toward Blaze. We went twice within the first month it was open, which could explain some of the hiccups we experienced.

The staff seemed very unorganized/poorly trained. Both times, they were shouting back and forth to each other which was really distracting and unprofessional. 

I ordered the gluten free crust and it was awful. Firstly, there were holes in the crust before it was cooked, which the staff tried to push back together. Despite asking to cook it longer, hoping it wouldn't be so thin it would be limp, it was. I had to roll the slices up to eat them. 

With so many other options for build-your-own-pizza, u wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype. Great toppings, fast service and very tasty. Finally a new pizza place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome !!! It's my favorite place from now on. 

I received coupon in my mail to get free pizza of any kind , witch was really nice and pleasant. 
I am lactose intolerant,  witch means I had no chance to eat it. But no. They had gluten free dough and also gluten free cheese,  witch was amazing, so I build my own pizza with any ingredients I want.
Those guys who work there was all really nice to me and been really patient with me and took great care of me. And my pizza was out of the fire in 5 min... witch is great time for pizza....

I really want to thank you Fire Blaze Pizza for all quality you provide and the greatness of Italy. 

Well my pizza was obviously for free, but I will absolutely visit again soon... 

That k you so much for everything guys... 
You got 5 from me..."}
{"text":"We frequent this restaurant, however after tonight I will think twice before returning. I placed an order on the app for an 8:15 pick up at 7:50. For those that don't know.... The pizzas are prepared but not \"fired\" until you pick up. I got there at 8:14 and my pizzas were sitting on the counter.. Done and had been for 5 minutes (according to the gentleman that put them there) but the sticker on the box has a 7:59 time stamp. When I asked why they were cooked already I was told ASAP orders are cooked right away. When I asked what determines an ASAP order, they told me its written in the notes(keep in mind that it doesn't state anywhere that if you write ASAP your pizzas would be cooked immediately. So how would I have even known to do that?!). I WROTE nothing On my order and purposely chose 8:15 because that would give me enough time to get there and hopefully the pizzas would be warm when I got home. Instead of working with me and remaking the pizzas.. Both the lady at the register and I'm assuming  the manager just argued with me. I'm a very tech savvy person and use my phone for everything...... This was not a glitch on my part. 

Now I'm sitting here eating a cold pizza."}
{"text":"Love the concept, loved the pizza, loved it all!

Staff: Super friendly. They check to see if you've been there before and if you haven't they give you a quick run down. I got a happy face on my order for being there for the first time and as silly as it sounds, it brought a smile to my day. They were also really quick with my order which is really important since downtown is always in a rush.

Ambience: There is quite a bit of seating and they seem to come by and clean the tables frequently. I can't comment during lunch rushes but I was there on a Sunday evening and I didn't have any issues finding a table.

Food: I had the Caesar salad and a pizza with Applewood, shredded cheese, spinach, mushrooms, extra pineapples, pepperoni and Italian sausage. It's one price for unlimited toppings and you can get extra of certain toppings at no additional charges. The crust was thin and crispy and not burnt/charred. It was super delicious! The ingredients tasted super fresh with the most notable being the spinach. The Caesar salad was a nice side dish.

All in all, super place with super food!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My friend and I walked over here from the bus terminal because we wanted a quick bite to eat, and we were not disappointed! The wait was a tad long since we got here during the Friday post-work rush hour but it went by pretty quickly. The way that the restaurant works is that you can choose from their signature menu or build your own pizza for $12.95 with unlimited toppings - score! 

One thing that really made my experience 10x better was the service here - the employees are all super friendly and very efficient which is appreciated when the place is so busy. 

The pizza itself was delicious and the perfect size. If you're looking for a quick bite that's better than your typical fast-food place, I would definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I'd rather order Papa Johns.  I get it that it's quick for people who want a cheap quick bite at lunch but it's not tasty and there are no healthy options.  Cold beer would be a nice touch, too"}
{"text":"I loved this place. I like that everyone can choose their own type of Pizza and have it made."}
{"text":"Blaze just hit the spot for pizza lovers! It's like having satisfaction at a lightning speed! For me that's the true meaning of \"fast fired\"... well I got the full crispy crust pizza sensation with my choice toppings. Blaze... a perfect situation for people like me on the go and knowing I got the perfect meal at a very cozy and clean pizza joint! Lastly, a happy staff means a savory and delicious and hearty meal! Thanks guys! You have a happy customer in me! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Had an absolutely amazing first experience here. This is a new location that just opened recently in Champaign and I'll definitely be coming back. The main thing that impressed me the most was the customer service. Everyone was on point. My friend was getting a vegan pizza and the girl even offered to change her gloves for him. Extremely impressed and happy with our experience. Food was delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Thin crust and yummy. They get it a little burnt but nothing that'll stop me from eating it . Also their s'more cookies are so delicious!  Big wide open place. Doesn't feel cramped. Definitely on my list of places to go when I'm in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"Finally open! Great location and friendly staff! I'll be a regular here! This place makes building your own pizza fast and easy! They do not count toppings like Pieology does which I cannot stand! Pizzas are fired up in their huge oven and come out nice and hot! Plenty of toppings to choose from, drinks, beers, and of course desert and salads too! You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"I have ordered a salad here several times, either the Arugula or the Mozzarella one, sometimes a combo with added Chicken. All times before served by very friendly staff. Today, no. The girl at the front of the line looked at me with glazed eyes as if it was the first time anyone ordered salad with chicken on it, and besides that I commented that the 3 tablespoons worth of salad by the counter would not be enough. She said she needed to talk to the manager, who was literally 3 feet away chatting away with a customer about how \" Oh yeah I am a manager too, me and the other guy.\" As my confused helper and I looked on, and she finished her convo, my gal said \"he wants more salad and it's kind of empty.\"  The manager walked three feet over looked at the dismal salad selection, looked at me with a sour puss, paused and snarled, \"you'll need to wait, it's in the back\" then walked back to her new friend to continue bragging about her job. That's it. Nothing about my initial question about having added chicken. Not even a smile. My gal just looked at me with the same blank stare I got when I first arrived. I was thinking, who are these people and what did you do with the good ones? I walked out and went next door to Mad Greens and spent a small fortune to get a fresh salad and no attitude. Well worth the cost. 
With so many restaurants in this area, places like this can't afford to hire managers who have no clue how to treat (now former) repeat customers. 
PS the remaining salads looked like they were there all day. Not fresh looking at all."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is delicious and beautifully priced & the customer service is always on point as well. I've never gone here and left disappointed. Best pizza in town in my opinion

I always get one pizza that's kid friendly for my 2 year old. So I usually get garlic & bacon chicken or whatever delicious meat  because it's beyond delicious. And then my husband and I also get a spicy one with the spicy marinara & stack it with deliciousness. Oh and don't worry about getting carried away with  delicious toppings because They don't charge extra. WHAT!? YES!! They care about your happiness here so they do not put an extra burden on you. 

I haven't even mentioned what really makes this stand out from other pizza joints. You get to pick your fresh toppings from a port of sub-type of layout. Watch them stack your dough & a few minutes later.... You have a fresh yummalicious pie ready to be devoured!  Highly recommend this place to anyone who loves their taste buds enough to treat them to a slice of heaven!"}
{"text":"We tried this out a few weeks ago because my husband was in the mood for a magherita pizza.  Since I had seen this place on my drive into work I thought I'd give it a try.

It was pretty easy to navigate and the staff were very helpful.

I got a caprese salad (with an incredible balsamic vinaigrette) and he got the red vine pizza.  They were both amazing.  

The decor is very industrial and interesting.  We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a great idea for a pizza place! You go through the line, like at subway, and build your pizza exactly how you like it. Then they throw it in the oven and call your name when it's done. Awesome! Unlimited toppings for 7.95? Sign me up! I already love this place on my very first visit!"}
{"text":"Their team got back to my shitty review with such class. Great customer service can sometimes make food that u weren't crazy about taste much better. Maybe adding the extra cheese helped also. Regardless, good job guys."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great pizza.  Everything taste so fresh and they have quick service."}
{"text":"I have to give 5 stars to Blaze Pizza. Ive never gone to any fastfood/ restaurant that treats you so well. The whole crew smiling and laughing enjoying their job and great customer service. One employee that took my breath away was Natalia. She was just marvelous so Polite, caring and looks like she treat her customers with love. She went out her way to bring me a box for my left overs and asked if I needed anything else. Thank you Blaze Pizza for having employees like Natalia on your team,  keep up the wonderful job."}
{"text":"Got a free pizza mailer and decided to try it. Omg!  Cool trendy vibe and retro Volvo orange decor. We had the green stripe pizza. The service was friendly and efficient. The pizza very tasty. We will return to try a couple other pies and maybe create our own. Welcome to the hood."}
{"text":"Yum! I have been snobbing the make-your-own-pizza places based on my one negative experience. I got to say, this place brought me back around. My boo has been trying to get pizza from here for a while and I have been quite skeptical. He finally broke me down and I took a drive to Blaze. 
Staff was sooo friendly! Young smiling faces willing to help. And what they serve is $8 (or so) a personal pizza customized to your liking with all the toppings you want. Pretty awesome considering the pizza is good!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place out. Bad idea. Both of our pizza was SO burnt. I took mine back and they kindly remade it. I got my second pizza yet it was still burnt! It's really frustrating spending $20 on burnt pizza."}
{"text":"This pizzeria is ok nothing I'd go out of my way to try again. I like the pizza oven idea as it reminded me of Italy but the toppings are mediocre."}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this pizza. Was it bad? No. But is it worthy of anything above a 3? No. Nothing made an impression. The crust was neither deep and doughy, nor thin and floppy. I can't even remember tasting the sauce or cheese. This the definition of bland."}
{"text":"So happy to have another amazing restaurant on the north side! Love the atmosphere as well as the pizzas. The prices are very reasonable and the personal pizzas are still big enough to share. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was about time! Living in California for a while, I had been used to Blaze Pizza. I have truly missed the unlimited choice of toppings you could put on the pizza. 

I had been trying to explain to my Toronto friend how Blaze Pizza's concept worked for quite a while. If I had to explain it to you guys I would say it is like a SUBWAY® restaurant but for pizza. At Blaze Pizza, you get to pick the sauce, the crust as well as the toppings. 

Not only is it a very fun experience but there is a wide range of toppings,  ranging from bacon, pepperoni goat cheese, as well aragula and various other premium toppings. 

Would definitely recommend to any pizza lover!"}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to visit Blaze for the first time during a Yelp Elite event... They really rolled out the red carpet for us and left me totally impressed with their food, service and overall ambiance and culture. 

The food and drink are top notch. I crafted my own pizza with half spicy and half traditional red sauce. I liked the spicy best, for what it's worth. Also had my crust \"painted\" with the pesto sauce. Yummy! Toppings included ovalino and shredded mozzarella, Italian sausage, roasted garlic and arugula. I love arugula on pizzas and I especially love restaurants that offer arugula on their pizzas! (Annnnd, restaurants that know arugula goes on at the very end, after it comes out of the oven.) The pizza was delicious, if I say so myself. And, I'm the one that created it, so I think I get to say so, thankyouverymuch. Beer selection was spot on with a wide variety of local brews from Birdsong, OMB, NoDa, Triple C, Highland, etc. 

We also had the antipasto salad (I didn't try it but the Boyfriend seemed to enjoy it), s'more cookie (just a tad on the dry side -- would have liked more chocolate and marshmallow) and blood orange lemonade (um, so yum!!). 

Their price point on pizza is almost unbelievable. $8 for unlimited toppings?? I'm not sure how they do it but I sure am happy that they do! Seriously folks, this is cheaper than any other fast casual concept and the food is SO much better. 

Every single staff member we encountered -- from the greeter (Shorty) who explained the process to us to all the topping putter on-ers to the cashier that closed us out -- was so friendly and accommodating. I felt like a part of the family and so enjoyed learning more about the company and their business philosophy. Recyclables! \"Clean\" ingredients! Philanthropic and community minded! What a cool spot. 

Can't wait to give lots and lots of business to this amazing little pizza place on the corner of Camden!"}
{"text":"You can't beat a build you own pizza and get a drink for less then $10! You can put and toppings you want. And it cooks in less then 10 minutes. The pizza doesn't get soggy. You have to get their blood orange lemonade, it is my absolute favorite!

The space is laid out never well, lots of tables and booths. Very stylish and trendy restaurant. The staff is very helpful and nice. 

I would totally recommend this place to anyone that loves good pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Blaze has been generating a lot of buzz lately, so I thought I would come and check it out. It's really close to the movie theatre, so the address on Yelp is actually incorrect and misleading- it lead us closer to Santouka Ramen, for some reason. Just know that it's close to Cineplex! It's on the same street!

The whole build-your-own meal really reminds me of Chipotle or Subway- you can watch them make your pizza and then thrust into the open oven, so there is no funny business here. The staff are so nice and full of smiles, which is really rare for any 'fast food' restaurant. I ordered one of their classic pizzas, but you can still customize whatever toppings you want! Everything was done both efficiently and professionally. 

Blaze has parmesan, chili flakes and herb shakers to sprinkle on top of your pizza. I love how the pizza itself is inexpensive, filling and delicious! I literally wolfed down my pizza slices in three bites. I would definitely come back to Blaze- I may order it online next time! 

One super-small, nitpicky complaint- you need to ask the staff for the washroom key. This is my least favourite form of toilet access. No one should know I actually use the washroom- no one."}
{"text":"everyone's great. foods incredible.

they remember their customers. either greeted with, \"welcome back\" or \"is it your first time here\" if it is your first time there, they'll go out of their way to explain the process and pricing which is a plus."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza with options to pick from classic recipes or build your own. A ball of doe is flattened by a machine; resulting in a thin crust with a hand-toss feel. The toppings are added in view of the customers, Subway style. Their pizzas are light, not too greasy, and use some gourmet toppings like blue cheese and Kalamata olives. You can also add any topping at no extra cost. Big appetite warning: these pizzas are light, one might not do it!"}
{"text":"Great and delicious experience here tonight. Seriously the best gluten free( and regular) pizza in town. After tonight they also are awarded best staff in my book! Right when I got to the front of the line to order ....I got a phone call I had to take....It was the worst timing! I was so embarrassed that I had to walk away in mid sentence of ordering to take it. The younger guy was so kind when I was ready to order after my call, and was not rude to me after I had to run away from him talking to me .I wish i got his name- but he was a younger, African American man that provided great service despite my rudeness"}
{"text":"Great pizza at affordable price. Super-friendly staff. Great root beer, music was a little loud. Clean and tidy."}
{"text":"First timer here! You get in - either build your own pizza or choose from their signature's off the menu. All pizza are personal size, which will fill 2 people with an average appetite.

Subway style method, where they ask what type of dough, sauces, meats, veggies, etc. You're charged at a fixed price when you build your own, so toppings are unlimited with no additional charge! No need to shy away from requesting extra of anything. TIP: Ask for ricotta, and extra at that (yummy, white cheesy dollops).

I fully recommend Blaze if you need a quick, cheap fix to a pizza craving. Modern/hip ambiance, fresh ingredients, efficient and enthusiastic customer service! 

Snag a s'more for dessert. $2 and they toast it for you!"}
{"text":"I usually LOVE blaze, but I was extremely disappointed by my visit to this location. The service was absolutely awful, and the food was meh at best. Let me elaborate. I walk in, don't get greeted like I do at my home blaze in California...not the end of the world. The girl taking my order was not at all enthusiastic. She acted like she did not know how to put sauce on a pizza and made zero eye contact with me every time she asked me something or talked as if she was mumbling. I remained optimistic, then moving on to the meat portion the girl asked me if I wanted one or two turkey meatballs (like really?! They usually just break a bunch up and pile them on!) the toppings were not put on as I like. I waited at the cash register for almost 5 minutes and the guy running it was doing like 5 other jobs at once while the other employees didn't seem eager to help as it was not even crowded (at least not as close to as crowded as the one I go to in the Bay Area)...my pizza comes out of the oven and sits at the cutting station for over 5 minutes without anyone touching it. I was pretty disappointed after seeing that, and yes my pizza was really cold, the toppings were not even cooked (all the veggies tasted raw) and the sauce was not spread correctly. I was optimistic about this location since it's near me and I frequent the Trader Joe's across the street almost daily, but I guess I'll have to find a different location to go to. The only positive part about my experience was a staff member checking on me outside while I was eating. Kinda sucks because I just moved here and would have become a regular (at least once a week or more) at this location but unless something changes I probably will not come again. I hope management will take the time to better train these employees and let them know how to handle properly making a pizza and getting it out to the guest in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"A tasty pizza in a casual fast food style setting. 

My friend and I stopped in to grab dinner on a weeknight. There was only one party in front of us, but the process to get our pizzas was very slow. It looked liked there were call ahead orders or a drive through that took precedent. Once at the front of the line we waited 5-10 minutes to place our orders. One our orders were placed it was only a few minutes from there. 

For some reason I thought Blaze was a place where you make custom pizzas and toppings are included like similar restaurants. Instead the menu offers signature pizzas. Toppings can be added, but it looked like that would add up fast. 

I ordered the Red Vine which was mozzarella, parmesan, olive oil, basil, tomatoes and red sauce. It was pretty good and I liked that the texture and flavor of the crust. I did prefer the taste of the pizza to the competitor across the street. My friend ordered the Meat Eater and substituted sausage for the meatballs. That was my favorite of the two pizzas I tried and what I would get on a future visit. 

Overall, I would prefer customizable pizzas, but the taste was good enough to bring me back. Hopefully on future visits the service will not be as slow."}
{"text":"I love the build your own and there is a huge variety of toppings.  I stuck with vegetables which were very good. The pizza is nice and crisp and thin which is great.  Overall very good.

My negatives were I don't like that the crust is pre portioned and rolled out.

The spicy red sauce was way to acidic.

They have a good variety of cheeses but unless you get the mozzarella they put very little cheese on the pizza.  The pizza really needed more cheese to offset the acidity of the sauce.

Also the air conditioning was way too cold. Bring a sweater.

Good pizza just not my favorite."}
{"text":"My favourite build your own pizza place. They give good portions of whatever toppings you want.  They serve wine too. Btw, white wine goes great with pizza."}
{"text":"Blaze!!! This is my second visit here and I love the whole concept. Build your own pizza and get unlimited toppings? Sounds amazing. For my first visit I got a preset pizza and shared with a friend (it was good - not really special). But this time, I was determined to get a Build-Your-Own pizza. 

I customized the pizza to my liking by adding spicy tomato sauce and then garlic pesto sauce on the crust. I also added applewood bacon and Italian sausage for the meats. Arthichokes, mushrooms, and spinach for the veggies. Finally, the cheeses - I went for ovalini mozzarella and gorgonzola. 

After they took the pizza out of the oven, I was asked if I wanted arugula or other sauces drizzled on top. Wish I topped it with arugula. Other than that, this pizza was almost perfect. The thin, crispy crust and the diverse ingredients made this pizza awesome. Plus, the service here is amazing. They asked if my pizza was looking good at every step of the process. Really appreciate all their hard work in making my pizza the greatest!

I'll be back here for more!"}
{"text":"Love! If you love pizza you will love blaze. They make everything just how you like it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming here!  They have the best pizzas, salads, and desserts and excellent customer service.  

We were in there today and they had a difficult customer but they all stayed professional and took care of him even though he was one of those annoying, whiny people you just want to leave.  He made everyone uncomfortable. 

Thanks you guys for the delicious pizza and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Not a great or terrible experience. Placed order online, very easy. Showed up 2 minutes after they said it would be ready and it was just coming out of the oven, no biggie. I sat down to eat it and realized that they had forgotten the drizzle on top. Went back up and they were nice about it and added it. When I sat down to eat it, I noticed it looked a little burnt. It wasn't awful looking and I was limited on time so I ate it anyway. It was just an ok experience. Was hoping for more because they are an easy walk from my work."}
{"text":"The service was amazing, they're nice, greeting you at the door, and they go above and beyond, really making the customer feel like the priority. 

But the real draw are the fresh ingredients. Definitely a go-to for me."}
{"text":"What a cool concept. Food was very yummy and perfectly done. Staff was not very friendly and honestly looked miserable working there. The place was slammed indeed and a manager does go around the restaurant and make sure all customers are happy. I suggest they do get more staff or just limit the number of orders done at the same time. I agree with Vera that there is sloppiness observed and since it is easy to fix I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a good pizza place, the staff was attentive and knowledgeable in getting everything done, I've never been there before and received a coupon for a free pizza in the mail. So decided what the hell let's go. One thing I don't like is everything is all up-sell. A free pizza should mean free and not $18.00 at the end of the line for a basic pizza and a small salad. Other than that the pizza was great."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Best pizza in Charlotte!  I would give this 10 stars if possible. First off, the pizza is delish, everything is perfectly seasoned, and the price is great!  Salads are fresh, ingredients are fresh, and it is so fast!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"OMG so good!! I went one in Bakersfield and thought it was amazing so I couldn't wait to try it again. I was NOT disappointed!! I love that they make it in front of me and I can ask them to do a little bit or more. I also love the spicy red sauce! Wish we had one near me in Colorado!"}
{"text":"This opened up in my hometown a year before moving to Charlotte. It was one of the top casual restaurants that I was going to miss about home. When I moved here, I thought about opening up a franchise here. Luckily this opened up right on the rail. It is affordable and delicious! Haven't had the signature pizzas yet. I have always done build your own. They have a large variety of toppings and sauces that all flow well together. System is kind of like Qdoba, Chipotle, or Subway where you tell them what you want as you go down the line. Pizza cooks fast in about 3 minutes. I seriously thought about moving to the apartment attached to Blaze so that I could eat this everyday."}
{"text":"They dropped my sisters pizza had to wait extra 10 min...manager gave me a buy on get one free coupon...I told her I'm buying another pizza, can I use the coupon for the free one? Mind you...I ordered 5 pizzas and drinks, spent $50 plus...the lady could have used the coupon towards the other pizzas I bought right? No compensation at all!!!"}
{"text":"I loved all the options I had in creating my own masterpiece pizza! Their toppings were very fresh and the guy that helped me create was very knowledgeable and made excellent recommendations."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place! Where else can you go and create a totally awesome pizza with as many toppings as you want for less than $10?"}
{"text":"I have come to this Blaze ever since they opened and I have never been let down! The gluten free dough is super good, I always get it a little well done so it is crispy. 
Their customer service is amazing! Leslie, Mady, and Eddie are always there when I go and they are superstars! Seeing them is the best left of my week!
Keep it going Blaze! You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"Blaze is truly an amazing place to eat and has never let my taste buds . The staff is always super kind and energetic. Although a particular night a few weeks back was strange. This young man, Frank, was cursing and yelling at this woman, who I assume is a manager. This was unacceptable given the fact that my two young children were by my side. To my disbelief, Frank was still working there when we returned last Friday. I might have to find a new Blaze location if this young man is still working there"}
{"text":"Blaze pizza never disappointed me until now. First off my husband and I ordered two high rise pizzas, a cookie and a side salad. When we received our order one of the pizzas was not a high rise so we took it back and they made a new one. The cashier which was very unprofessional as she approaches the register she mumbles (I can't deal with everyone today) says I did not charge you for the high rise and I said yes you did. Had to show her the receipt. Then I guess she noticed she never charged me for the salad and said no I didn't charge you for the salad. So I paid no big deal. Until I left I noticed she never gave me a cookie but instead a brownie. They messed up my order all around. On the receipt there's no info about management or anything so I can't complain to them about it. The receipt she's she charged me for a cookie but instead got a brownie."}
{"text":"We ordered three pizzas for carry out.  The ingredients were terribly portioned, heavy on onions and less veggies.  The crust was ridiculously thin and wet from the sauce.  I would never order from this place again."}
{"text":"As a pizza lover, I can't stress how impressed I am with this place. We had a simple pie (just tomato and cheese) and a link in (Italian sausage, sautéed onions and roasted red peppers). The sauce is delicious and flavourful, one of the most important aspects of a pizza for me, and the setup is extremely well executed. From start to finish it took about 5 minutes to get our pies and there was no confusion as to who's pies were being made.

Big shout out to the cook manning the oven, he was managing 12 pies at once and doing so in a calm collected manner and helped us with an extra pie plate when we wanted to share.

My only criticism is the dough press that makes each pie perfectly similar also looses some of the airiness that some of the best pizzas have, so the crust is less like a bread and more like a cracker. Still, for the price and execution, I don't think it can be improved on."}
{"text":"First time going to Blaze today with my boyfriend and oh my lord I was in love! The staff was very friendly and the pizza was absolutely delicious with unlimited toppings. The place is very clean and tidy and the environment is very cozy. Big thanks to our server Chevonne (sorry for the spelling) for being so nice and lovely with us! 5/5 definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This is the perfect mix between fancy and fast food. Tastes like gourmet but only takes 15 mins, and it's build your own pizza which is always stellar"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a  friend who posted a pic on instagram I was so amazed at the amount of choice of toppings to choose from I went crazy and picked majority of the toppings and not bad for 11 bucks. There is always a lineup good location right beside the mvoie theatre and I like the fact there are different sauces yo choose from. This beats pizza pizza or pizza hut by a longshot . Definetly coming back to this place again one of the best pizzas I ever had."}
{"text":"Love this concept. You order your pizza and pick your toppings as they make it in front of you. Kind of Subway-esque. Into the oven it goes and it's ready in less than 5 minutes. They call you up when it's ready. Delicious to.

If you don't want to make your own they offer a selection of pizzas to order off the board. It's a thin crust style pizza and about 11 inches. Great price and good selection of seats.

With two more locations opening in Calgary opening this year I think they are here to stay."}
{"text":"First time here, last time here. Paid for build you own they told me I could have whatever I wanted on it. I picked artichoke hearts. They gave me half an article heart for the whole pizza. I asked for more and they said that's not the policy. The pizzas we ordered were undercooked because it was very busy, so they didn't taste all that great because it was just mushy dough on one side and burned cracker on the underside. We were also the first ones in line and the last to get our pizzas. Probably won't return here based on taste. Bummed about the compounded turnoffs."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a pizza with vegan cheese. It's fast and honestly very good. We are there every Sunday!"}
{"text":"Good solid four stars. First introduced to this concept at MOA in MN. Then in little ole Lodi. Now just down the street, yaah. Helpful staff and tasty fare. Arranged sort of like Chipotles. Easy to figure out. They have a couple basics, some signatures and of course build your own. They have a GF option for crust and we were told they didn't use corn meal for those who are allergic. I had the chicken bbq (extra peppers) little less messy to share with grandson. Wife had build your own with everything but the kitchen sink in it. Pizzas were cooked crispy (cracker crust) and arrived piping hot. They have a comfortable dining room and for spring and summer a nice patio. 97 degrees so we chose to dine inside and enjoy the AC. The only negative for me was they have Coke products (Pepsi Guy.) NP since they have water. Didn't explore their beer options since grandson was with, but they do have beer available. Expect they will make it into the list of regulars. Nice addition to the Eastern corridor."}
{"text":"Awesome food, good quality toppings, tastes really fresh. The opportunity to build your own pizza is awesome. On top of that they have a gluten free dough options."}
{"text":"Literally had to stand here forever before they acknowledged my existence, and the pizza was undercooked."}
{"text":"Service and pizza are great and we love the selection beverages. Everything amazing!!! We have been here twice in 3 days- the kids begged to come back.  The staff is exceptionally friendly! Great, especially for a grand opening!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Plenty of sauce and toppings. Staff is friendly and helpful even though it is grand opening. Anybody would love pizza need to come here. Wood fire is the way to go for pizza. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"You can't beat a build your own pizza for this price! Good, quality ingredients and made to order. My fiancé put literally everything except a few of the veggie toppings on his pie, and it was still only $7.95! Good size. We ordered 2 pizzas and ended up taking about a half of one home. The line gets long so be prepared. Can't wait to try to s'mores everyone's talking about!"}
{"text":"Great pizza joint. Very busy and long wait when it's lunch time. 

Customize your pizza and choose as much as you want. Great selection.

I can't give it five stars because I had a similar pizza in DC. The toppings there were even better or more premium and the pizza was long. The pizza here is just a simple round pizza which is kind of boring in comparison. Come on it s a custom pizza. Use a different shape."}
{"text":"This pizza place is out of sight! It's very Californians fired and uses fresh ingredients. Very health conscious all calories are posted on the board lot of healthy choices to put on your pizza made to order right in front of your face. Reasonably priced at around $8 a pizza and one will fill you up as they are single pan single people Pizza. The restaurant is clean and the workers are nice. Check this place out it's pretty rad."}
{"text":"I looked at all the excellent reviews and was sadly disappointed.  The pizza was chewy and 2 of the 3 pizzas were burnt."}
{"text":"I received a free pizza card in the mail. One of the things I noticed is it similar to Subway but they move very quickly and seemed knowledgeable about what they were doing. I noticed sign time up by the oven that said something similar to don't go far it takes only 180 seconds to cook your pizza. I made my own pizza telling him what I wanted on it. I told them that they were a little light on the pizza sauce and the mozzarella. Other than that it was excellent getting to choose the ingredients I wanted on my pizza. It actually went to 2 1/2 minutes. I got my pizza to go. I had half and took the other half to my grandson. I liked it and he said he enjoyed it and liked it also. The reason for four stars instead of five is I thought they were a bit too light on the pizza sauce mozzarella."}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and I went to Blaze for dinner. It was busy and they were understaffed which is understandable for the wait and the stress level of the employees. However, once it was time to pay, a red head guy named Don rang us up and I asked about the buy one get one. In a very rude tone he asked if we had a coupon. We didn't so we moved on. Once our pizzas came out of the oven Don made a very rude comment about them being gluten free (we both have wheat allergies and that comment was extremely offensive). He then gave the pizzas to us for dine in when we wanted to go. When my boyfriend asked Don if we could take it to go he said, \"well can't you just eat half now then take the rest in a small to go box?\" We had limited time and asked for it to be put in a large to go box (At the register we never were asked if we wanted it dine in or to go). Don gave us more attitude for asking him to do something extra and then threw the pizza cutter across the work station. Blaze pizza is amazing and this bad experience won't stop us from eating here again. However, when stressful work days happen, employees shouldn't be rude to their customers."}
{"text":"Fast service, yummy food, nice atmosphere, plenty of choices. What more could you want? Their pizzas are so amazing and service is efficient yet friendly. I love this place!"}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place a while ago. A cool atmosphere in a central location just at Yonge and Dundas. Fresh ingredients, delicious dough and great taste. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I'll start off with the pros: Excellent and attentive service, new and modern decor and set up, clean and efficient establishment BUT the burnt crust on the bottom side of the pizzas is just not my cup of tea. I actually ordered the gluten free crust which doesn't burn (thank goodness) but the bottom side of all the pizzas of my companions were all burnt. 

After some investigation, I understand that this type of establishment is all the rage nowadays and that burnt or well done crusts are what people prefer these days. Hmmmm, guess it is just not for me."}
{"text":"For a smidge over ten bucks there's not many places in the city, let alone the country, that do unlimited toppings. 

I built my own online and the staff made it perfectly, no problem. Some toppings of note on mine were chicken, bacon, sausage, arugula and artichokes. All the ingredients in and on the pizza were fresh, and the crust was crispy and not burnt at all - impressive.

My only gripe and why I'm only giving 4 stars is that the staff forgot to put my pizza in the oven until I realized and told them fifteen minutes later. But overall, this is definitely one of the better pizza joints I've been to, especially for the price."}
{"text":"Always a treat when eating here the concept is great and the staff is always friendly and helpful. We frequently eat there for lunch"}
{"text":"Decided to come try this place out during nuit blanche. It was packed, line up out the door, however it moved pretty quickly. Waited in line for about 15 mins and ordered the make your own pizza, which is the same price as the specialty pizzas. Having unlimited toppings was pretty awesome, tough part us deciding what to put lol. I made the rookie mistake and decided to put on everything I liked, turned out pretty good but I think I'll add less things next time. Crust had a nice wood oven flavour and was the perfect thickness and had a nice crunch without being dry. Didn't expect it to be as filling as it was. If your not too hungry, it can be shared, but if you are, then having your own is probably your best bet."}
{"text":"Firstly, I love the concept of this pizza place! It's like chipotle for pizza. My family and I have gluten and dairy allergies so we were super excited knowing that we could eat delicious pizza close to home. We've been to the location in Lynchburg and we had a great experience. We felt confident that the staff knew how to handle our dietary restrictions. At this location however, the staff seemed uncomfortable and or unknowledgeable handling our dietary needs. My daughter has a severe dairy allergy. There was cheese that was dropped in the same container as some of the meat. At the other location, the staff brought out new topping containers so that there was no cross contamination. We didn't receive the same service here despite informing the staff. All said and done the pizza was delicious; however, we hope they will improve they way they handle food allergies so that my family will feel more comfortable eating here."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this establishment. Came in on 2/13 and the place was closed early. I made a call to the Assistant Manager and he was understanding of my frustration, took ownership of the issue and offer a complimentary pizza. I definitely wasn't expecting a free meal yet a kind gesture on his part.  The ingredients are fresh, great price on the pizza and exceptional customer service!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 'Build A Pizza' on line.  When they gave me the pizza all boxed up it did not have the arugula and olive oil finish as requested, easy enough I just pointed it out and they corrected it.

They put A LOT of sauce almost too much and I ordered goat cheese and there was hardly any of it on the pizza.

The Aqua Fresca is AWESOME!  Prickly Pear with a shot of Lemon Mint.

Place was very clean and staff friendly.  I will try once again but I will order there so I can watch what is going on my pizza.  

So far Fired Pie is a bit better but Blazed is still new and working out the kinks."}
{"text":"Highly recommend it, fast service, amazing za and very easy on the wallet. Also they have a 4 dollar pizza night!"}
{"text":"The ability to create your own pizza in a chipotle fashion is so fast and easy.  I love the unlimited amount of toppings at such a low price."}
{"text":"The line is long...but that is always a good sign that the food is great!  My son first took me here and I thought it was such a cool idea - assembly line for make your own pizza!  Like a Chipotle but pizza!  And the price is very affordable for the fresh ingredients and great service!  The staff is happy and works well together, going through the line - you pick your sauce, cheese, meats, veggies and so far - I have not been limited!  (unbelievable!!)  They put it in the pizza oven right in front of you - after paying you just wait for your name and you can finish customizing as your pizza is boxed (for take-out).  Great deal all around!!  Definitely a family and visitor favorite!"}
{"text":"As an Italian, I'm rating this pizza 5/5 based on a few factors: thin crust was the perfect amount of chewy, the price is great especially considering you can add all the toppings you want at no extra charge, it cooks in just 3 minutes, and it is totally comparable to a lot of full service dine-in restaurants. Customer service was great, too. I'll be back soon! Please start delivering!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, better customer service! Shout out to Lizzy & Kenya for being so awesome. Would highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Over priced and frankly not that tasteful. You might as well build your own pizza because it's the same price and you can add additional toppings on it too. I have visited this pizza joint a second time for a second chance and can't say it will get a third."}
{"text":"I love the art lover pizza at blaze. But more than my pizza, Sophia is amazing. Her customer service and smile have won me over as her regular customer. 

Updated 12/29/17
Just witness Sophia manage a difficult customer. Her smile didn't leave the entire time and I don't know if I would have been able to keep my patience the way she did. 10/10 again. Food is awesome too. As always."}
{"text":"Fast food pizza.
 The set up reminds me of Subway. So read the menu ahead of time so you know what you want and aren't holding up the line.
I ended up on a Monday where you can build your own for $5. Sooo worth it. All toppings, sauce and cheese were good. And I LOVE a fired oven pizza.
The beverage section had some unique choices. blood orange lemonade, black cherry soda etc.

I will be back, probably on a monday"}
{"text":"I was visiting family and they decided to get take out from here. I have to admit I was a little skeptical and was expecting greasy pizza but I am glad to say I was wrong. The pizza was excellent. There were many options of toppings and sauces. We all had build your own pizzas. I put chicken, roasted garlic, arugula, mozzarella and BBQ sauce drizzle on mine and it was fantastic. I wish we had these where I live!"}
{"text":"Son had a cheese pizza I had their vegetarian.  Both were good. They serve beer as well. Neat atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, wonderful people, so many toppings! Someone accidentally got my order wrong and felt terrible. Kept asking if I wanted them to remake my pizza."}
{"text":"Great tasting and quick pizza. Sometimes could get a little soggy if you load it up with too many toppings. Always easy to find seating and it's in a convenient location across from Dundas Square."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. 

No matter how many toppings you get, its all one size and 1 price, which is like 11 bucks with tax.

Personally I got the Meat lover's and minus the red onions and added more meat like sausage, bacon, meatballs, ground beef, pepperoni, and green peppers and pineapples!

It was my first time there, and all the staff was patient and friendly with me and all the customers in line!

If there were more locations around the GTA, I would most definitely come there all the time instead of buying pizza pizza (yuck) :)"}
{"text":"Wowza that was good!! Build you're own!! And super delicious!! Very excited about sharing this location with my sons school for a fundraiser event!!"}
{"text":"Good service and good pizza. Lots of options if you build your own. It's a good time to go since the students are gone. Their beer selection is limited, but they have a good selection of regular drinks"}
{"text":"Pretty good build-your-own pizza place. I am not a fan of building your own meals but it's pretty simple and quick to do here. Tons of options without feeling overwhelmed. Staff were friendly as you moved down the line. I have already been back a second time and could see definitely myself going back a third. I would come to this place for a casual meal. It's loud inside and seating is somewhat limited so I wouldn't bring a first date, work function, or study here.

The pizzas are thin crust and have a variety of toppings and finishes to choose from. The amazing thing is that you can put as many things as on it as you want for the same price. They also make their own drinks all of which I liked--they're fruit based but much less sweet than actual juice. 

I had the White Top the first time because I was too lazy to point out what I wanted, but I made my own the second time. I had applewood bacon, gorgonzola cheese, garlic, arugula, with a pesto finish. I definitely recommend just making you own :)"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I've been to this location. I really like the crust, it's not to thin or thick. The service was very quick. I'm surprised that I managed to eat the whole thing by myself! The only thing that I disliked was that I had to ask for extra of everything. They weren't generous with the toppings unlike pieology. It was light of everything literally 4 pieces of basil and spinach, so of course I had to ask for extra."}
{"text":"Love this place, one price build your own, lots to pick from, taste great, happy workers, clean and friendly place. I love it"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp after a friend checked in the day before.  As soon as I saw you can create your own pizza with as many topping as you wanted for one price and they have Gluten Free crust, I was considering.  

I then read the about us and the faq on the company website and I was there.

We had two pizza's and they were both more then Amazing.  The crust is a thin crust a Huge plus, and with all the toppings I had which was just about all of them, I was told it would take a little longer to cook which was fine.

I was able to watch the guy working the pizza oven and he worked with perceission looking like an artist at work.

The entire staff are very warm and friendly from the time you come in the door until the time you leave.  Everyone makes you feel welcome and if you need something all you need to do is ask as they are there for you.  This kind of service is not always readily available at most places in this town, but here, they are there for you.

I highly recommend trying this place and encourage you to give this place a try and write your review.  I will be back...."}
{"text":"HUGE fan! Fast food but extremely delicious. Build your own pizza with a lot of toppings to choose from. Forever a customer right here!"}
{"text":"1st time in pizza was so soggy couldn't even pick up a piece very disappointed (watery sauce ) yuck"}
{"text":"I usually love blaze.. one of my favorite places but today There  were issues.. you shouldn't charge people $2.25 for drinks when the ice machine is broken.  Very uncool. Pizza was good as usual"}
{"text":"I love how you can customize your own pizza here! The price and size of the pizza is just right! So yummy and it fills your tummy."}
{"text":"Man this place is bomb!  Literally every time I come here, I alway forget to take pictures! But if you ask me a good spot to get a personalized pizza, I would totally recommend this place in a heart beat!  I love customizing my pizza to fit my cravings, and they have way more options then your usual pizza spots that deliver.
I have been here three times and plan in coming here more since it's not to far from my friends house.
Every time I come here, I alway opt for the create your own pizza. They have a regular crust and a high rise one. Definitely two good choices depending on your mood for bread! Besides Vodka Sauce, and Regular Marin tomato sauce, they have my favorite Alfredo sauce as an option!  I alway get that with extra cheese, they have more than three cheese and even a vegan cheese!  Next is your toppings- I alway load up on spinach, olives, artichokes, peppers, zucchini, and pepperoni and sea salt!  My little one always grabs a regular cheese pizza, and that's even good. Maybe because they use quality products and cook it in the oven fire grill.  Making the pizzas extra yummy. This location has lots of parking around and at the restaurant, it's located in a shopping plaza right next to Jersey Mike's Sandwich.  You can sit indoor or outdoor, which are both good options, especially when the nights were just right not to cold or hot.
So if your ever in the mood for pizza or something different, come on in and grab a personalized pizza.  It's sure to tame the cravings!"}
{"text":"3.5 I went to Blaze on a weekday for lunch and I quite enjoyed it. Lineup moved moderately fast but seating is limited. 
I opted for build my own and separated the pie in half for 2 combinations. 
I like how they offered a salad bar assembly style approach to building your pizza. It was fun and you feel like a kid in candy store almost if you're the indecisive type.
I also enjoyed how they offered some novel and premium toppings like different cheeses and sauces.
The end result was a thin crust, delicious pizza that is enough to feed me for 2 lunches. For ~$15 tax in, I feel it's quite expensive for pizza. It's the experience that felt fun so I'm not mad. It wasn't the best pizza I've ever had, but I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"I just recently moved to the area and our Aunt was showing me all the food places a round us. She suggested pizza for dinner- who doesn't love pizza?!

Come to find this place is a Subway Style Pizza but super delicious, and not at all like a subway sandwich. You could choose one of their signature pizzas or you could do a Build your Own Pizza for only $8.25 with as many toppings as you want. They had many options of sauces, meats, and veggies to choose from. 

After I created my pizza, they threw it in the oven while we waited to pay.. before we even made it to the cashier our names were called and it was hot and ready to go... and boy was my mouth watering at just the sight of it. 

In less than 15 minutes from walking in the door I had made my own personal, DECENT SIZED pizza and was devouring it. 

They also have other options to make a Pizza Salad - also gluten free options. 

Lastly, they had a variety of different lemonades and juices to try that really topped off the meal. 

I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"The food is good but the staff is incompetent.  They are so slow and I think the entire staff needs to figure out what is going on.  

We do really like coming here but it is a painful experience every time.  Maybe it is best that I just order off the app and walk in to pick up so I don't have to face the staff and feel the pain."}
{"text":"Best pizza spot in south end.  Makes fuel pizza taste like cardboard.  The staff they have here now is super friendly and polite.  If you see Eric, Mike, Scrappy, or Chicken Little working...  You're going to get a GREAT Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good the only thing i didn't like is that  were the fire place the pizza its leaves the burn black stuff on pizza not so tasty . Either then that i would go back :)"}
{"text":"If your looking for a new fast food place, but don't want the usual, you should add this to your list! Fast, friendly service, and a tasty thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place so had to give it a shot. Glad we did because we loved it. We had the build your own pizzas for only $7.65 and a beet and goat cheese salad. The pizza was delicious and flavorful and made right in front of us and cooked in like a few mins. Great spot !"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and it's always great (and is a lot better than the other make-your-own-as-many-toppings-as-you-wish place .. won't name names....) 
The staff are all very nice and they check to make sure they've put enough of the toppings and that you're happy (Subway could learn something) 
I like to do the build your own
Last time I went with a \"veggie works\" - red sauce, mozz, goat cheese, the fresh mozz, spinach, basil, kalamata olives, sauteed onions, mushrooms, artichokes - so so good
And I didn't even think about doing the half/half! That will be my next order
I also like their selection of drinks and the fact that they have small take out boxes ready for you for that slice you couldn't finish
Plus I like the selection of \"post bake\" pizza toppings - if you want extra sauce, olive oil, bbq sauce, etc 
If you're around the Eaton Centre, check this place out - way better than any food court options"}
{"text":"I know this place has great quick pizza & salads but this review is for the customer service. We received 5 star service from Amy from the moment we walked up to the counter. What a genuinely nice, helpful employee. Her service was above and beyond all expectations. 

So, my husband was getting off his shift and he was craving pizza. We came here (knowing it was close to closing) but they didn't make us feel rushed or unwelcome at all. The manager (Lizzy) saw his badge when he went to pay and thanked him for his service. The appreciation for law enforcement officers in a time of turmoil made our day. Apologize again for staying after closing but we really couldn't have asked for a better experience!!!"}
{"text":"Vegan cheese and tofu chicken pizza with spinach, zucchini, mushrooms; bell peppers and tomato given with a smile"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here a couple times a week and it's delicious!! Food is great, staff is exceedingly polite (everyone smiles!!). We love coming here!"}
{"text":"Been to blaze's pizza a couple of times and haven't been disappointed by the service and quality of food you get at its price point. I usually get the one topping with the spicy tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese - even with one topping the pizza is delicious! High quality ingredients and the crust itself is always crunchy and thin, always a consistent good experience. If you're getting the one topping pizza I would recommend the turkey meatball with moz +spicy tomato sauce, if you're getting more than one then go crazy and load up ur pizza!!! The service is great as well - always friendly and smiling folks working hard :)"}
{"text":"This place is on point!! Loved how quickly the line moved at noon, clean and  bathrooms are nice.The customer service was great. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Update: They certainly redeemed themselves. The staff was very friendly and my pizza was cooked perfectly this time. Even tho they had a rush they weren't all over the place. 


So generally I love this place. The 2 stars are not for the food bc it's usually great, however tonight on my to go order it was a bit soggy in the middle, it's for the lack luster service. The girl that took my order was not engaged when listening to what I wanted and seemed a little put off as if I was interrupting her other duties. Then when my pizza was waiting to go in the oven I stood there for about 5 mins before the same girl took my money on the register even tho there were a ton of workers milling around. I'll probably go back because usually the service is very friendly. Hopefully on the next visit I can up the stars. I really don't like giving these types of reviews but something about her customer service just rubbed me completely wrong along with her co workers that just stood around."}
{"text":"Do you know what this reminds me of? If a pizza shop and Subway had a lovechild, Blaze would be it. They have an impressive set up, from the machine that flattens out the dough, the display of all the possible toppings, and the fast and expert handling of the pies through the oven, the final touches at the end with the arugula, oils, and various condiments.


The crust has a very uniform consistency and the toppings were impressively evenly distributed so that every slice is more or less equal. Truth be told, the quality and the apparent freshness, as well as the speed of the whole process puts this above the major chains with the closest behind perhaps being Panago. I learned too late that after a certain number of ingredients, a build-your-own is more economical than a signature pizza.


I recommend getting the simple pie if it's your first time, and going for the blood orange lemonade. For me, Blaze is an easy choice as a quick pre-movie option that doesn't kill the wallet. Nice."}
{"text":"Ok the verdict is out Blaze pizza is much better then PizzaRev...I'm all about service and the people working at this location were on point. I make my own pizza but they have many options to choose from...if you choose to make your own or pick a speciality pizza it's $8.25. The crust has a lot of flavor and the different toppings where evenly distributed! I give this place 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Great Quality and Awesome staff. I love this place it's fresh and the prices are great too. I love that you can build your own pizza and get as much toppings as you like with no extra charge! It's so worth it! They're aguas frescas are delicious my personal favorite is the Key Lime Mint it's so refreshing. If you haven't been here I recommend it. The only thing is that they tend to have a big line so be prepared to wait in line to order. Having said that You can always order online or get the app and place your order through there too. Aside from that it's become one of my favorite pizza joints."}
{"text":"Been here so many times. Can't go wrong since you choose your own toppings. Absolutely delicious and quite easy to eat an entire pizza yourself. Got a little soggy towards the end, maybe I eat slow. 
The drinks also seem fresh and unique.
 They sell desserts too!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch yesterday. 

Great location for this joint.

Walking in, we were immediately greeted by an employee who walked us through the process.  She took her time and asked us if we had any questions. We didn't feel rushed in any way.

My fiancee and I ordered custom pizzas, with unlimited toppings for a flat fee (I was totally skeptical at first thinking the quality wouldn't be there). I added the spicy tomato sauce and mozzarella, gorgonzola, goat cheese, chicken, roasted garlic, pepperoni, Italian sausage, and spinach.  Topped it off with some olive oil pesto sauce salt and rosemary. If that wasn't a flavour explosion in itself I don't know what could be. My fiancee ordered most of the toppings as he really wanted to get an idea of the quality of each topping.  Changed my mind at the first bite, each ingredient is quality and flavourful, definitely bang for your buck here.

Needless to say the process in itself was quick, efficient,  and the taste was beyond our expectations. Chipotle for pizza joints is what he referred to it as.

Atmosphere and ambiance is great as well. I saw they had a kids birthday party going on so they do accommodate for those interested. 

We can't wait to come back here. Hope there are plans to expand to the rest of the GTA."}
{"text":"*****5 Stars!!

You get in line and start to build your pizza. You have a variety of fresh toppings to choose from, including vegan cheese and gluten free crust. By the time I paid for our pizzas and got our drinks the pizzas were done. They are thin crust, so they cook fast in the high temperature oven. Our pizzas were well done and crispy, just the way I like them. If you don't like them well done, then you might want to mention that before they go in the oven.

$8.00 for unlimited toppings on an 11\" pizza. Well worth the money and worth the drive from Summerlin. This is arguably one of the best pizza places in Vegas. I will be back and I recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! The guys in the assembly line are so professional and yet somehow friendly. The food is just the topper on a great experience. Very casual place -- pretty hip but not at all upscale."}
{"text":"I've been to Blaze twice now and have really enjoyed both experiences. The line can be daunting when you first walk in, but it moves pretty quickly! The first time I went here the first employee in the assembly line was very friendly and explained to us how everything worked quickly as to not hold up the line behind us. (I'm sure this happens often as the concept is still somewhat new for a pizza restaurant). 

After adding all of our toppings and paying at the register we sat down in the dining area. This area is the only problem I have with Blaze, they have some gorgeous giant windows to look out of, but zero shades. The sun is blinding during lunch time hours, we actually moved to the back tables to get out of the sun.  It even gets in the eyes of the employees when they ask for your toppings selections, they have to squint at you, poor guys. 

After hearing our name called we retrieved our pizza and started munching. It was delicious! The second time I went here was with my brother and his vegan girlfriend, she was so excited to see that they have vegan cheese and loads of veggie options to choose from. Definitely something for everyone!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy eating ashes, come get a pizza here. I realized they just opened, but I paid $10 for a pizza that I couldn't even eat. The toppings looked picked over and not fresh. The mushrooms were turning pink. The staff are rude and rushy. But the biggest thing was that the oven was not clean and they sat my pizza in a pile of ashes."}
{"text":"I have had Blaze Pizza at a few locations around the valley. I love their pizza. The ingredients are fresh and delicious. Unfortunately, the staff at a few locations and (especially this one) ruins the experience with their uncleanliness and poor customer service. Yesterday, we went into Blaze after getting pretty blazed. We were hungry and excited for pizza. The staff was unattentive and was having their very own side conversations. I get that these kids are young- but a LITTLE bit of customer service goes a long way. They used the same spatula for multiple sauces, used the same gloves for cheese and dairy as they did for fresh basil and vegetables. 
When we got home, there was a hairball on the bottom crust of my boyfriends pizza. So gross. Not just a hair... a legit hair BALL. So sad , this place was so yummy."}
{"text":"Well I can now say blaze is my new go to pizza spot. There specialty drinks are delicious and the pizza is always cooked to perfection. I like there toppings options."}
{"text":"AVOID this location at all costs and go to the Durango location! My wife and I came to eat a late lunch. The whole time we were eating, there were gnats/flies that kept bugging us! Even when our pizza was ready for us to pick it up the cook was even trying to swat them away!

UPDATE: They made it right and everything was perfect! That's what I call great customer service!"}
{"text":"We loved this place fast and friendly, the pizza in my opinion tasted better than pieology. They may not have as many choices for toppings , but they more than make up for it on the price. I wish they would open one in Lake Havasu City. It would make a killing. The only down side to this location is the parking lot is kind of on the small side."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I have been a huge fan of this place ever since it opened. As a resident of the apartment complex that houses the location, it goes without saying that I have been a regular customer since day 1. Even though the quality of the food has dropped slightly as of late, it is the quality of the service that is most disappointing!! The last few times I have visited this location I have left questioning whether I would return. On each of these occasions, the employees seemed to be preoccupied with goofing off rather than assisting the customers.  When I visited the other night, the employees seemed completely uninterested in proving semi-decent service most less what I would consider to be acceptable. One guy kept wondering around the dining room aimlessly while another stood behind the counter with his pants barely pulled up above his knees which I find extremely disrespectful and not acceptable for such an establishment. Everyone else stood around joking and barely paying attention to the customers that were needing assistance. 

I think management should take more initiative in making sure this place gets back to the same level as where it started."}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying the only reason I even gave this location more than one star is because I believe in the blaze brand. Everything else that myself and my guests experienced tonight was absolutely atrocious. 

Nicole, the Evening manager tonight (27SEP2016, 830pm time of our visit) was one of the most unprofessional and disrespectful managers that I have ever come across. I have never stepped inside such a poorly run establishment. Apparently, there were some new employees tonight and her idea of training is to yell commands across the back pizza prepping area at them. Not once did she kindly show them how to do the task, nor did she even give them the time of day to actually interact with the guests- which they were all doing quite well before she interrupted them. Her lack of leading by example and causing quite the scene not only disgusts me and my guests, but caused an awkward and uncomfortable environment to the point that guests were just taking their pizzas to go. 

I recommend a better managerial selection process and possibly a longer period of training for the employees, as what we witnessed tonight was just plain unacceptable. 

UPDATE 10/08/16

I returned here on a Saturday for lunch and couldn't have been more pleased with the service. We had people even come by our table to check on our food and ask us how it was. Obviously the other manager was an anomaly (thank goodness). 

For a quick bite and chipotle style pizzeria, this is the place to go if you're in Tempe"}
{"text":"Veggie pizza is delicious when combining kalamata olives and gorganzola cheese..plus I added spinach"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! Had the White Sauce Signature pizza which was great. The combination of flavors was perfect. Hubby built his own pizza which was fun, because they make the pizza right in front of you. The S'mores pie was perfect and their blood orange lemonade was super tasty. The safe was super friendly and helpful which was really nice. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Whoever thought of a fast food pizza place is a genius! This place is very convenient for on the go or quick lunch break. The staff is super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Neat concept and very affordable! The staff was helpful, as this was my first time to a Blaze. They walked me through the process of how it all works and how you get unlimited toppings and endless customization for only $8. They even serve beer and wine! Top quality toppings and sauces go on the pizzas. After I placed my order and waited only a few minutes the pizza was done! Quick, tasty, and affordable pizza! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Picky eaters will love the Blaze!  Order the toppings & seasonings you like (large variety) to put on the crust & sauce you select. Just the right size for a fulfilling meal. Glad one finally made it to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to go if you want a quick pizza that is going to delight your taste buds. I always go with the build your own because it is the most economical choice. Choosing the traditional crust I got the classic red lightly spread on my pie, i always find that they put too much sauce for my liking. Then I went with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, italian sausage, and basil. I also had them sprinkle some oregano on top before cooking. The pizza takes only about 5 mins to cook and it comes out with the delectable crispy and burnt crust. I always ask for the fresh pesto on top because it ties the pizza together perfectly. The pizza is big enough to split into 2-3 meals so either bring your friends or clear out space in your fridge because you'll definitely want to take home the leftovers. If you like pizza, who doesn't like pizza, and want a great fast meal Blaze Pizza is the place for you."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend love this place! It's the chipotle of pizza. They have a ton of options (even vegan cheese and meat) and they usually are pretty quick getting them out. These kids behind the counter work super hard!! Get a credit card machine that allows tips on the receipts! Also a plus...they don't charge extra for a side of ranch!"}
{"text":"I love this Blaze location just as much as the others. Your parking is free in the evenings and weekend. Try not to come when they are swamped it's hard for people to maintain their happiness when customers make numerous changes and requests (Kidding it's albeit customizing)!  Enjoy, I have every time and get a brownie"}
{"text":"RANCID TEA.  This is one of my favorite restaurants.  The only problem is that 6 out of the last 8 times I've been, the unsweetened tea has been rancid.  The tea container must not be getting cleaned properly. Please take steps to make sure the tea container is properly sanitized and the tea is kept fresh.  Besides that issue, the pizza is great and a great value.  The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. Get the build-your-own pizza and you can have any toppings you want put on."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm a fan of the half pesto/half classic red sauce loaded with veggies and gorgonzola. So much yum! I actually started craving pizza after eating here - it's that good. The salads and s'mores dessert are pretty tasty as well.

Bonus star for not putting the bathroom in a basement and super friendly and enthusiastic staff. I would totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today. Nothing Special at all! A little bit better than Dominos. The pizza tasted pre-made instead of made to order. I was not impressed with the quality of the dough. I will not return because I see no value in this place."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting. Factory pizza an all. But great customer service and very good pizza."}
{"text":"Everything was good , I love the build your own pizza concept for one price.  Put anything thats available on it.  Fast, inexpensive night out with the kids eating what we love PIZZA. 
The downside is they had these little annoying flies everywhere.  GrOSS! 
The staff is nice, a lot of young ppl working.  Chase was the team member that was on the floor tonight and he was pleasant."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe there's margin in a $7- pizza when nine people staff the line...but the smooth performance, high-quality, wood fired genius of Blaze casual quisine has finally made it to Vegas !

My twist on ordering is a build-your-own, mostly a margarita with the addition of crushed garlic olive oil and parmesean...give it a try!

As far as crust, the dough is a bit over-worked; as a result not as thick or fluffy on the edge. The sauce is definitely San Marzano tomatos, top quality!

Bottom line, Blaze Neapolitan is second only to 800 Degrees who ripped Blaze and improved the dough recipe.

Try them both and decide yourself."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh, fast and & yummy! 
Same concept as subway only with pizza. 
Choose from their signature pizzas or build your own. Great verity of sauces and fresh toppings. Relaxed casual atmosphere or take it to go... 
Will be a regular here for sure!"}
{"text":"Great service. I hope the owner see's this. Lee gave great service from the moment I walked through the door. He actually took the time to remember my name. As well as trying to remember the prices of all items in the store. I can see him running the place. Best service I've had in a Blaze pizza. And I go in Nevada and California. Thanks Lee for the great experience."}
{"text":"I ate here days after eating at Pieology (for comparison sake of course!). I thought it was good, but there were a few things that I wasn't a fan of. Their Canadian bacon or ham as some prefer was only available as smoked ham and on pizza I find that to be far too salty. The green peppers were also cut into chunks rather than in slivers, which is hard to eat on pizza. They also ran out of the fresh mozzarella balls, so we had to wait around for them to grab more and the person behind us also ordered it and that was all they had in the store. Running out of ingredients is no bueno. The service from the staff was good and the speed of the food was good. All in all, it was good, but if I had to pick just one, it wouldn't be Blaze."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Couldn't help but think this would be a great place for teenagers on a first date, the cost is minimal and the atmosphere is pleasant.   My husband and I of 20 years really enjoyed it and will come back again"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! I stopped in here after a couple of friends recommended it. I was immediately impressed with the place. It has a really cool vibe and layout. The staff was super friendly and helped me figure out what I wanted. 
 
I ended up getting the gluten free crust (for an extra $2). You can also get regular crust or a high rise crust. It's really cool how they form the Doug right there. Next, you go though an assembly line to pick your sauce, cheese, and toppings. There is a seemingly endless array of options to pick from! After you have everything you want, in goes your pizza into the oven. The whole process is pretty quick!

This pizza was great! I'm definitely going to be coming to this place more for lunch as it's easy and fast. If you love pizza, you NEED to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for 20 minutes for our pizzas which isn't unheard of but one of my reasons was to also get a gift card. Who runs out of gift cards?  Blaze!!!!  I guess they're losing out on some major revenue because I'm sure I'm not the only one. Someone didn't do a very good job on the ordering.  Also I wanted to order online but you have to pay first without the option to redeem a gift card or buy gift cards."}
{"text":"Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza's slogan is \"intelligent choices for our pizzas, people, and planet\" and fast-fired. Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza (abbreviated Blaze Pizza) would be an intelligent choice for lunch before Bad Owl Cafe. 

   Blaze Pizza is relatively new to the fast-casual dining landscape. The original Pasadena shop opened a few years ago in 2011. From Pasadena, California; Blaze Pizza is expanding across the Nation winning people over. One of the places Blaze Pizza has expanded to is the Las Vegas Valley. This very location at the northeast corner of Eastern and Horizon Ridge in the former Sweet Tomatoes Express is the second location in the Las Vegas market. 

  When I walked inside, I took in a contemporary urban interior incorporating stainless steel and reclaimed wood. I also took in the long counter and oven. Blaze is a custom built pizza chain. As a matter of fact the name \"blaze\"  means how quickly the customer can create their own custom built fast fired pizza. The heart of the Blaze assembly line operation is the pizza oven. This pizza oven in 800 degrees hot. This burning hot temperature makes the custom built pizza in three minutes (give and take). The first thing I did was chose the 11 inch custom pizza I wanted. Decisions! Decisions! There are at least forty toppings to chose from.  I'd take a short cut by choosing from one of the signature pizza's for $8. I chose the veg out pizza pie. This included zucchini, mushrooms (my favorite pizza topping), red onion, mozzarella, red sauce, and dollops. The neat thing about Blaze is that nothing with the custom built pizza is set in stone. On top of the veg all pizza, I added meatballs and bacon. Another neat thing about Blaze is their dough process. Their dough is made individually at each restaurant before it is fermented for 24 hours. In a glance the assembly line process goes like this: 1. Order, give your name and pay for the pizza. 2. Create the pizza if it is not strictly a signature pie. 3. Wait an expected three minutes. 4. Enjoy the custom built pizza. 

    There is sufficient tables including indoor and patio seating. On a serene Vegas afternoon, I sat in the patio overlooking Eastern Avenue. My eyes were on the pizza. With the pizza pie, I enjoyed bottomless fountain Coke that brought the price of lunch to $10.25. Near the Coke (not Freestyle) machine, I added pepper to my creation and grabbed a plastic fork and knife to enjoy the overflowing toppings. 

   It seems that many of us in the Las Vegas valley agree that Blaze Pizza is an intelligent choice. There are so many combinations of creating the 11 inch pie that no visit is the same. The price is reasonable. The pizza is delicious. The upshots are that they just opened a store by the Galleria Mall at Henderson, and they initiated a niche for custom built pizza with Pizza Rev also going strong in the market. Blaze Pizza really is an intelligent choice for custom built pizza."}
{"text":"After driving up to Cathedral Rock to enjoy the cool temperature I ended up in Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza to enjoy the hot temperature. That is the hot temperature of an 11 inch custom made pizza pie prepared in an oven at 800 degrees. 

  This Blaze Fast-Fire'd (abbreviated Blaze Pizza) is located in the rapidly developing shopping cluster near the North  Decatur at the 215 interchange in the Winco-Target Shopping Center. Blaze Pizza was asphalt when I  reviewed this Winco and Firehouse Subs not so long ago. Just like the shopping cluster by North Decatur and the 215, Blaze Pizza is growing. This is the newest location in the Las Vegas valley. 

  After my brother and I hiked in Cathedral Rock on Monday, we made it to Blaze Pizza around 6:30 PM. At this time on a weekday, it was busy. Fortunately there were plentiful tables. And fortunately I knew the Blaze Pizza routine from my original visit at the Eastern Avenue Henderson location (https://www.yelp.com/biz/blaze-fast-fired-pizza-henderson). 

  From the point of ordering to getting the pizza, Blaze Pizza is all about building your own custom pizza. A statistician would be able to show a formula of how the customer could eat here every day and have a different pizza pie for at least a month. This paragraph shows the process through my experience. As soon as I made it to the order and pay station, the lady there asked me if I'd been here before. I did and ordered one of their signature pies with additional toppings. Because they were out of meatballs and regular sausage, I ordered the Link In signature pizza pie. This includes mozzarella cheese, Italian sausage, red peppers, and sautéed onions. After I paid $10.70 for the Link In ($7.95) and a small Coke ($1.95), she marked the pizza on a box on the start of its route on the assembly line. My next stop was the toppings station. If the Subway toppings station is Exploration Park Hill, the Blaze Pizza toppings station would be Mount Charleston. The selection of toppings is massive. It was here that I opted out of the red sauce that is included with the Link In for the spicy red sauce. I'd compliment the pizza pie with black olives and mushrooms. From there the customized pizza pie traveled into the 800 degree oven. I'd wait for a few minutes. I'd get slightly concerned when the customers that ordered after me were picking up their pies. When I looked toward the pick up area, I noticed that when the man took the pizza out of the oven that he immediately cut it into six slices. I also observed that Blaze Pizza is popular with families. 

   I was very happy with the pizza. The spicy red sauce was the winning ingredient that elevated the pizza pie to greatness. Supporting the spicy red sauce were the first-rate ingredients that made up the pie. All the fresh  first-rate ingredients created a first-rate pizza pie that was a pleasure to eat to the last crumb. 

 The first-rate 800-degree custom made pizza deserves a hot rating. Without further due, I declare this Blaze Pizza \"4 Stars.\""}
{"text":"Update: I hadn't checked my messages on Yelp! because business owners and managers rarely respond to these reviews, but I happened to check my messages and saw that Justin messaged me from Blaze Pizza! 
I couldn't decide how to change his score, but I upped the review to 4 stars for these reasons: (1) Justin, the owner, acknowledged my complaint, apologized and took ownership of the issue and asked for more information to ensure the problem doesn't happen again. That's becoming more rare nowadays. Many times I see managers and owners arguing or making excuses. It really makes customers feel valued which is so important for businesses to do with all the choices afforded to consumers nowadays. (2) He offered me 2 free pizzas. Grant it, I was just visiting in AZ helping my daughter move in to her apartment for her 2nd year of college, and there are no Blaze Pizzas where I'm from, but my daughter lives there, and I plan to give the free pizzas to her since she's the one who was even more upset than me that night they locked there doors early. (3) Their pizzas are really, really good! 
I will update this review if my daughter has any trouble getting her free pizzas, but if not, I feel that Justin did a great job appeasing me and changing my feelings toward the way he runs his business."}
{"text":"Andrew, Chris, Larry and Jonathan rocked it. They gave me some excellent service and I will make sure to come back again"}
{"text":"The has quickly become our favorite pizza place! You can't beat the price and everyone can pick out exactly what type of pizza they want. The build your own toppings concept is fun to take part in and it all cooks so fast! And the portions are huge - we've never left here hungry :)"}
{"text":"This pizza place is similar to Pieology but both great ideas. The place is always busy but they're quick. $8 for a really good size pizza with all the toppings you can dream of. Probably way better than Pizza Hut, dominoes, etc...."}
{"text":"Waited all day until I got off work to go to blaze pizza for pie day, got there at 9:30 they did not let me in, they did not close for 30 min!!!! Never coming back"}
{"text":"3.5 rounding up to 4.

You can park in the guest parking on the first floor of the Camden apartment complex behind blaze for free.

Walking in everyone was super friendly.  We ordered the white pizza and an arugula salad to go.

The ordering process was easy and we were out the door fast.  

Getting home the pizza was just ok because the bottom of the pizza was a little burnt.  

The salad was really good and fresh.  It had strawberries blueberries and cheese.  The dressing was thick but tasty!  I recommend getting it on the side."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the pizza- and being able to get whatever I wanted on it. It's a good bit of pizza for only $8. I also liked their beverage selection. The blood orange lemonade is the bomb.

We went on a Sunday afternoon and the line was really long and moving slow. As in took 27 minutes from start to finish. So not really the quick experience we anticipated. 

I know now that I would not wait again, but would definitely be back for another pizza."}
{"text":"I love pizza. During recess when the other kids would ask me why I didn't marry it, I would wonder how to go about doing just that. I still haven't figured out the answer.

In the meantime, there is Blaze. Much like a Subway or the variety of Mexican places where you follow your order along, here you lay one price, and get whatever you want on your pie. There are additional charges for a few things, such as deep dish, but generally it is all on for that one cost.

As with competing service Pie Five, there are some suggested pies or you can make your own, and just the same as there, you will want to be careful with loading up too many goodies as it works out better with just a couple.

That said, the result is good and when you get your food the eating is the best because you chose it - just make sure you choose wisely!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an artisan pizza cooked right in front of you for a decent price, then WOO you've come to the right place. 

If you're a first time comer try the Red-Vine, it's their most basic version of the \"Pizza Margherita\", or go ahead and try to make you're own, with the variety of toppings and the friendly staff, it shouldn't be hard at all! My \"pizza-maker\" was named Elizabeth, she was very patient and gave lots of recommendations on what would suit my taste-buds. 

When you're done with the pizza make sure to get one of their \"Blaze Drinks\", it might seem pricey but it's totally worth it. :))"}
{"text":"We only stopped in because our first option wasn't open for lunch yet. We started with a beet and goat cheese salad which was very good. Had a half and half pizza or the art lover and the white topping pizza, it was hot and crispy and thin and extremely tasty, we order another one because it was so good. So glade we found this place"}
{"text":"Update: My family and I have been coming to this Blaze location since it first opened. And while Blaze is still our go-to option for basic pizza place (Old School Pizzeria is still our all time favorite), we've run into issues with online ordering and with their app not working correctly. It's reached a point where if we want to order carryout we skip the app and call in the order. It's just the best way to avoid a lot of frustration and to get the pizzas we want. 

Beyond that the quality is just as good as ever. We always do Build Your Own and we're not afraid to experiment. Our current favorite thing to change up is to have them brush the pizza with pesto first, then we'll have them mix white sauce and spicy red sauce. Also this is one of the few places that my son never complains about and the staff always takes good care of him when he tells them exactly what he wants on his pizza. 

Despite the app / online ordering issues I'm still keeping Blaze at 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Everyone here is so friendly and they work really well together. 

I always get the high riser pizza which is a thicker crust with extra spicy red sauce. They have an excellent choice of toppings for meat eaters and vegetarians. You can also choose sauces to drizzle over your pizza when it's out of the oven. 

Try the blood orange lemonade. It's refreshing and not too sweet!"}
{"text":"I had a pair of gift cards so my wife and I visited this location twice, sharing single-service pizzas on both occasions.  We ordered the Art Lover pizza (artichokes, mozzarella, ricotta, garlic and dollops of red sauce) on our first visit.  The overall flavor was good, but the crust was a little too thin in comparison to what we have experienced previously and in comparison to what others were eating.  We fared better on our second visit with us ordering a Veg Out pizza (zucchini, mushrooms, mozzarella, gorgonzola, red onion and dollops of red sauce) to which I added fresh basil."}
{"text":"Great fun, easy flow, very helpful staff. Fresh toppings. Great to watch it being made in front of you. I had the green stripe pizza - delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to visit the new Blaze and it was as expected. The same great service and excellent pizza. Juan was the manager and he was awesome and friendly and Kate cooked my pizza to perfection! Its a little far from my house but if i am on the area I will definitely be back. I saw Diane walking around cleaning tables and engaging guests. The cashier was very friendly, I think he name was Jason."}
{"text":"Good quality pizza made fast. Size is personal sized and is little high in price, but it does taste good. Crust is thin and tasted fresh. I've tried this place twice and so far it's been consistent. There are a lot of workers so the line moves fast. Wouldn't go out my way for pizza here, but would stop by if it's along the way."}
{"text":"First of all, I was VERY impressed. I wasn't expecting that reaction when I visited on 3/14 for their Pi Day promotion ($3.14/pizza).

My brother and I arrived before opening (I thought they opened at 10:30) and once a line formed, we finally got out to join everyone. Fortunately, we didn't wait very long.

First, you tell them what kind of pizza you want - if you're building your own or getting one of their Signature Pizzas and they write this with your name on wax paper that will end up under your very own pizza. Second, you move down the line and choose toppings. In order: Sauce, cheese, meat, vegetables, and finishes. 

The best part? You can choose as many toppings as you want! All for one price: $7.95. And they do not skimp on the toppings. Yeah, so awesome.

I opted for the \"Art Lover\" (artichoke, mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, and red sauce dollops) and added meatball, chicken breast, roasted red peppers, fresh basil, oregano, and sea salt. I loved the care that each employee showed the ingredients and how it was placed on the pie, even though they were slammed with customers. (The care shows with how beautiful the pizza looks in photos)

The most important thing is that my pie was DELICIOUS. Really freaking great. The taste was perfection and I love their thin crust.

Other things to note: Pizzas are done in three minutes. So, even if it's busy, you're getting your food fast. I haven't found literature on official Blaze websites to cite the size, but I've read that it's 11-inches. I can eat quite a bit and I couldn't finish the whole pie."}
{"text":"Currently enjoying my pizza from Blaze and figured why not just review now...

Surprisingly quick with great customer service. 
Awesome concept and tasty thin crust pizza. 

$8 gets you a nice sized (what I would consider a medium) personal pizza customized with any amount of any toppings...great selection of toppings too! 

The blood orange lemonade is very delightful! 

My pizza pick tonight: White and pesto sauce, Moz and Gorgonzola cheese, grilled chicken, mushroom, roasted garlic, tomato, red onion, spinach, oregano sseasoning; topped with arugula after being fast fired in the oven.
Is your mouth watering or what?!
For dessert we indulged in the s'mores-cookie- sandwich which they fired up for us in the oven; good but not to die for, had to try it tho. 
4 stars instead of 5 simply because the crust does not hold thru the middle of the pizza but what do we expect for the price and 180sec fast fired pizza?! The quality is good tho! 

You gotta check Blaze out!"}
{"text":"No words. You are the commander in chief of your own pizza. The staff will cook it technically well. If you don't like the taste then you choose dumb topping combnations that don't mix well together. That's all."}
{"text":"I will most likely up my review to 5 stars when they get everything ironed out. I've been to other Blaze locations and the process runs a lot smoother. That being said, the pizza is great! Just what I've come to expect from Blaze."}
{"text":"I heard about blaze an finally had a chance to go try it. I was not disappointed my pizza was really good , you can pick a signature pizza or create your own . Luv the fresh mozzarella yum. Its a wood fired oven perfect crust. I cant wait to go back an make sure you finish your pizza off out of the oven with one of their sauces they drizzle balsamic is my favorite."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is  because I don't know about the food source and quality. I would give them 6 stars if they used organic, non GMO ingredient sources. Otherwise this pizza has the best thin crispy crust and it's built your own FAST so who could complain unless you can't pick good toppings for yourself.
 The service was polite, fast and helpful.
Place seems clean. No obvious grossness."}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing pizza!! I tried the build your own twice already and I prefer the white sauce to the regular tomato based sauce. They have quality toppings and good cheese options. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Can a transplanted New Yorker pizza snob (now a vegan) find a good pie outside the Big Apple? The answer is YES!

The topping choices for Blaze's vegan pizza are wonderful: spinach, roasted (or minced) garlic, red onions, roasted bell peppers, yellow peppers, oregano, basil leaf, cherry tomatoes, vegan cheese, tofu, and more!

I've gotten takeout 4 times from Blaze since moving to Vegas from NY 3 months ago. In addition to the high quality of the ingredients, the kids (hey, I'm 51. They're all my son's age) behind the counter are enthusiastic, respectful, responsive, kind and good at their jobs.

Kudos to the management team at the Eastern Ave location. You've set a great tone with your leadership style. Keep it up! And a special tip of the hat to all the young workers there. Bravo for making it such a terrific place  for every customer that walks in there. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was amazed by a \"build your own\" pizza concept! 

So I guess I'm a newb, I've never seen a place like this and my friend opened my eyes to delicious-ness. This place is pretty far where I live the actual place is a dine in restaurant with the bar by the front very much a chipotle and cafe rio concept of high quality food after that going to an actual pizza restaurant. Very clean place, easy to find and good customer service. The price is really affordable, specialty pizzas are 8.25 and \"build your own\" is 8.25. I did have an amazing cookie that was completely over priced.

You get to build your own pizza the toppings vary there's quite a few selections but not a ton. Veggie friendly, but not vegan friendly as there was not alternative cheese options. (I may be wrong call ahead) 

I had a yummy \"build your own\" pizza with tomatoes basil and ricotta cheese!!  My friend had \"build your own\" as well.

Definitely go to this place so YUMMY and very affordable."}
{"text":"To explain what its like: A chipotle inspired pizza place. All the ingrediants are fresh and there is a plethera to choose from! The pizza is cooked perfectly everytime. I have never left disappointed."}
{"text":"Well, I just can't get enough of Blaze and I am so thrilled they have come to the University area! We were desperately lacking fast casual restaurants and Blaze definitely delivers in that category. If you have never been to a Blaze, it is a Subway style restaurant. You choose your dough, sauce, cheese, meat, toppings, and seasoning to make your own Pizza. Now, they have some standard pizzas you can order that are pretty great but nothing is better than making your very own artistic creation of ooey-gooey goodness. The great thing about Blaze is that all their ingredients are fresh, locally sourced when possible, and free of preservatives. Also, they have phenomenal salads with seasonal and fresh ingredients! They offer desserts like brownies and s'more cookies. All fast fired in 90 seconds in their pizza oven, which you get to see! Try their homemade aqua frescas, they are so refreshing! This location also offers LOCAL brews on tap! Who doesn't love beer with their pizza?! Also, I love that the staff here are so pleasant, generous, and kind. Check this out, if you haven't, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 3/5
Happiness - 3/5

I'd been waiting so long for Blaze Pizza and.... it wasn't worth the wait. 

I did a build your own pizza and it was loaded sky-high with veggies. Literally a mountain of them (if I hadn't had both my kids on my own, I would have taken pictures). But what puzzled me was that as generous as they are with the veggies... they are equally as stingy with the meat. They literally used a singular meatball for the entire pizza. And what seemed like maybe an ounce of chicken. This threw the meat/cheese/veggie ration completely out of balance (although maybe I should have chosen less vegetables). The cheese was delicious and the best part of the pizza, especially the fresh mozzarella. 

I also got a cookie and brownie - both of which were good, but neither of which were transcendent (and they sure were messy). I also noticed they had a decent selection of craft beers for what is essentially a fast food restaurant (Kilt Lifter, for example). 

Sadly, I must also remark that \"blaze\" does not describe the speed of the employees. This location is new, so maybe they will work out the kinks. And the employees were very nice and well-spoken. But it took me about 15 minutes to get through the line, and there were only five customers ahead of me. And then, after you get through the line, you have to wait for the pizza to cook. That's quite a bit of waiting for a place like this.

I like the concept of a build-your-own fast-food pizza. But I've had it done better and taste better at other places."}
{"text":"I had to visit on Pi Day 03/14. Pizzas were being offered for $3.14, I couldn't pass up a great bargain. 

When I arrived, the line was literally wrapped around the outside of the building. I wasn't shocked, everyone loves a great deal, and pizzas for $3.14 got a lot of people there. 

I hesitated for a moment, was the line worth it I asked myself. I was already there so I decided to get in line. 

I was glad that I did. Though the line was super long, they were well staffed and they worked to move the line through quickly and efficiently. 

As I placed my order and made my way down the line, building my own veggie masterpiece, I interacted with a number of employees. Each employee was friendly, not stressed out due to the line. The last person finished off my pizza and asked , \"Pizza look good?\"  I gave a thumbs up and moved to the cashier. 

Pizza came out quick and I was happy with the quality. I especially like that Pizza at Blaze is not overly greasy. I think the size of the pizza is perfect, I didn't leave feeling overly full. 

The eat in area was well kept and clean. An associate walked around wiping off tables, picking up trash, sweeping, etc. 

I cannot wait until Pi Day next year! Lol. Until then, I'll gladly pay full price for a Blaze Pizza!"}
{"text":"If you don't like your pizza, you only have yourself to blame, because it's build your own, haha. 

So on this one I have myself to blame. I decided to mix it up and try the high rise dough (thicker dough). I loaded it up on veggies like I normally would, and also got the popcorn chicken (vegan chicken). 

In my opinion it was too much dough. The dough overpowered the toppings. I decided to be adventurous but I didn't care for it, haha. Next time I'll revert back to the traditional crust. 

Customer service could be better. The person who put my toppings on didn't smile or even make eye contact. The lobby was a little dirty, tables needed to be wiped down."}
{"text":"- Made fresh right in front of you.
- Build your own pizza with UNLIMITED toppings
- Pro tip - you can ask to get double the amount for your favorite toppings
- Takes around 2mins for your pizza to be ready
- My go to pizza spot."}
{"text":"Went here Friday evening with my daughter expecting what I get when we visit Mod or Fired Pie. Yea it was the same concept, build your own pizza using the subway method. What we got from this original byo was a deliciously made pizza for 8.25 that rivals Oreganos and Spinatos. (If you don't know by now 2 of the best pizza originated AZ joints in AZ). The crust was king here. One added bonus is the service was fantastic a step above the others."}
{"text":"Gord, Trish and I saw Ocean's Eight this evening.  We had supper beforehand at Blaze Pizza beforehand.  We've been there before and like it.

You can order one of their signature pizzas or build your own ... we built our own.  There are lots of ingredients to choose from.  A pizza takes just 180 seconds to bake.

My pizza had extra mozza cheese, pepperoni, ham, bacon and tomatoes.  Trish had a vegan pizza.  Gord's pizza had pesto sauce, pepperoni and bacon."}
{"text":"When I found out blaze was opening up near me was so excited!!! I love blaze. Build your own pizzas with no charge for anything extra is like a dream come true. The options are so endless I never know where to start. The staff is very polite and the area outside is so lovely especially at night. This location is a little bigger and better than the one on eastern. We always had trouble finding seating there. Blaze will always be our forever go to for pizza."}
{"text":"The value for unlimited toppings pizza is pretty up there (you can get whatever protein/veggies/sauce you want on your pizza). Although you could get everything, I would recommend you don't, as all those toppings will be really heavy on the pizza and make it soggy and the excessive amount of toppings won't even make it taste like pizza anymore (personal experience);
Other than that this place is pretty great albeit a bit slow as the ordering process causes a bottleneck backup."}
{"text":"I took a group of teen's here for lunch and it was amazing. I love how fresh the Pizza taste and how many different options they have. I will for sure be coming back again."}
{"text":"The best, almost-fast-food style pizza joint - and one of the best pizza joints I've been to so far in Toronto! Under $15 and you can load up your pizza with as much (or as little... but why would you?) toppings as you'd like, what's not to love?

Blaze Pizza is set up almost like a subway/mr. sub type of deal, but instead of getting subs, you're getting ridiculously awesome pizza's made with fresh ingredients right in front of you. So many options for meats, cheeses, veggies... you end up putting toppings on your pizza you didn't know you could put on it! I've been here twice now, once for dinner and the other right around lunchtime - both on a Saturday - and I'd be a regular if I lived/worked around the area. Size wise, the pizza could honestly be a personal pizza depending on how hungry you are since they're thin crust pizzas - and there's definitely nothing wrong with that! 

Now if they would open more locations elsewhere in the city/GTA..."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place in a terrible, tourist trap, part of the city (Yonge and dundas). While it is another american chain, it is one of the better ones. 

They're doing quick fire, thin pizzas for about $11. They cook in a couple of minutes and you're allowed to get as many toppings as possible. The pizza itself is more than a meal for a single person, but probably not enough to be shared between two average appetite eaters. 

The line is daunting, but it goes pretty fast as there are many workers and the cook time is a couple minutes at most. If you're indecisive, you can pick different toppings for each half of your pizza. You can also ask for arugula on top of your pizza at the end. 

Overall, its a good experience and pizza was delicious. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This was the best fast food/pizza experience I have ever had. Whoever answered our phone call to place an order 15 minutes before close time was kind, thorough and professional. I have never wanted to befriend someone simply because of how nice they were over the phone until tonight. Plus the pizza was made and ready to go in less than 10 minutes and absolutely delectable. If you haven't tried the vegan cheese; do it. 10/10"}
{"text":"Um YASS....

The pizza here is delish, actually beyond the word delish. Aside from the fact it's hotter inside than outside, the pizza is so worth breaking a sweat."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see Blaze open up across the street from Fired Pie. It's the exact same concept, it will be interesting to see who lasts. 

The pizza was decent, they have artisan items (I got the Red Vine ovalini - mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, parmesan, basil, red sauce, olive oil drizzle and added pepperoni). The crust is super thin and the sauce was good. You can also create your own pizza, same price unlimited toppings. 

They lose stars with the add on salads, they come pre-made and drenched in dressing. I asked to make my own and they told me it would take too long. There are no plates so if you are splitting a pizza or salad you have to use napkins or waste a cardboard box.

Fired Pie wins for me because you can customize your salad so they make it fresh without giving you grief."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. You can get the pizza off the menu or create your own. The size of the pizza is a bit small but it's really good. My favorite is the Green Stripe!"}
{"text":"An experiment gone awry. Followed ordering directions on the website and checked in with the perky and personable cashier on arrival. Waited for my pizzas and salad. And waited. And waited. After 10 + minutes asked the guy cutting the pizzas if mine were in the oven yet, he assured me they were. 10 or so MORE minutes, still no pizza love for me. Asked the perky girl and she found my order prepared but still waiting to enter the oven. Me=not happy. Another worker offered to comp me cookies as a consolation prize but I'd already purchased cookies so asked for a salad instead. No can do says she. Finally got my order and headed home. The crust is crispy and tasty, good. Sauce sparse but good also. Toppings were good but not plentiful, and I could find almost no mozzarella in attendance. Were I to order again, and it's doubtful, I'd be more proactive in making sure the pizzas were being cooked and definitely order extra cheese."}
{"text":"Great new place. Pizza was great!!  Great prices. Very nice employees and clean.  Like chipotle but pizza. A whole pizza for 7.65!! Who can beat that?"}
{"text":"Smells so good every time I walk by. Friend tells me you get all the toppings you want on a pizza for $12. And they serve it up fast. I need to try it soon."}
{"text":"Great food, staff was very friendly, Angel was very polite, service is great.
Pizza is delicious and the blood orange lemonade is awesome!!
Will go back again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizzas, cooked fast with tons of no extra cost topping options, vegan cheese, fresh ricotta, the fancy olives lol... nom salads.... aside from the great good,  the employees are always super upbeat and willing to help,  amazing attitude and energy from staff.
Edit.... the blood orange lemonade..... highly recommend"}
{"text":"Really dig the pizza here. I feel like I need to plan my make your own choice better before getting in line. You can't go wrong. So many options. Service is so fast it's terrific how fast the pizza cooks. I do like the spicy sauce and I am a meatball person. Love the buffalo style mozzarella. Plenty of spots to eat inside and seems to be plenty of street parking outside too. Can't beat it for lunch or a fast dinner."}
{"text":"I have now been to a few pizza place that are build your own. Blaze is by far the best. This location is my favorite. The is always friendly and fast. The food is good quality."}
{"text":"We have instantly become raving fans of Blaze. The quality of the ingredients and the awesome customer service will keep us coming back for years! We tried a Blaze creation the first time we visited, it was delicious. We created our own for our most recent dining adventure. The choices for toppings ensures everyone can find something that will speak to them. Thanks again Blaze team for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"I'll admit; the first time I heard about the concept of building your own pizza, I assumed it was just a gimmick. But after my first try, Blaze Pizza might be my favourite QSR pizza place in Toronto. 

From start to finish, the whole process probably takes no longer than 3-4 minutes for most people, which is incredibly quick. There's plenty of great toppings to choose from, and regardless of your choice, the pizza is almost guaranteed to taste great. 

My only complaint is that I can never choose a reasonable amount of toppings and always end up with at least 7-8 of em'!"}
{"text":"I've given Blaze a try three times now as it's right around the corner from my house. I can say the food is pretty good for the price. Unfortunately, it's not enough to make me go back. The employees are very friendly however they need a lot more training. For a fast-fired pizza place it seems there is no sense of urgency. I spent 40 minutes waiting for 1 to-go pizza last night - I'd rather spend the extra money and enjoy myself at Federal for that."}
{"text":"Made to order pizza at the counter with fresh Mozzarella balls with lots of toppings to choose from. Cooked pizza in 5 minutes so no wait.  Clean and new Pizza place and employees helpful and courteous.  Pizza was good with thin crust. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza spot in town! Any topping double meat or anything you want at just 7.95!!!!!!!!! Super filling too. Me and my bf have already been 6 times since they opened. It's enough to split. We get half a pizza made one way and I'll put the topping I love on the other half. Affordable pizza that's great tasting and filling! There lemonade are out of this world too"}
{"text":"The pizza was really good! I quite enjoyed it. 
I got the vegan cheese on mine due to a dairy allergy. I think they did fairly well for allergy protection by changing the gloves however there is a large concern for cross contamination as they drop food into the other food containers. You could see cheese in meat/vegetable containers. (Containers are set up similar to subway's.)
It could've had more cheese/toppings to cover the sauce in my opinion but it was still a very good pizza. 
My boyfriend says: 
More cheese 
A little less sauce 
When cleaning the tables/chairs don't clean the chair before the table (agreed that's gross)
He said otherwise the food was good and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"Came here again and brought another friend in to try it out, even more impressed than last time, good pizza nice people, and a good price. OMG the blood orange lemonade!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Blood orange lemonade. Get it. You need it in your life. 

I am in love with these fast casual pizza concepts in town. You can add as many toppings as you want and it's still the same price, here it's around eight bucks. They make the dough in house every day and also have a gluten free crust. I always get the spicy sauce, a mix of cheeses, turkey meatballs, and then decide the other toppings based on my mood that day. I recommend not going way overboard and adding too many. There's 40 to choose from, so choose wisely. I also recommend eating your pizza there right after it comes out of the oven. It only takes a few minutes to bake. For me, I usually can make two meals out of a pizza. Or, I could just as easily crush the entire thing in one sitting. 

Parking: several of the reviews here say there's no parking. If you can't find a street spot or don't want to pay a meter, Blaze does offer free parking at the Camden Gallery garage for up to two hours.

Misc: the workers always have smiles on their faces. I've met the owner here, both him and his wife are both super nice. The outside tables are great for people watching. Get a s'more pie for dessert and make sure to get it toasted in the oven. 

Seriously though, blood orange lemonade. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Drove here for their ultimate customizable oven pizza! It's a perfect size for one person. 

You could either choose their signature pizza or build your own. Price ranges from $5.25-$7.99.

I ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza which included chicken, mozzarella, red onions, banana peppers, gorgonzola and BBQ sauce drizzle.

All these pizzas are baked fresh and the wait time is not too bad"}
{"text":"decided to try this place out since I'd been craving pizza. it was a good choice for something quick and easy. I recommend the build your own option! they have sooo many options to choose from on the line and then some more at the end before they box it up for ya! the employees were all nice and friendly. the pizza was pretty tasty! i really enjoyed all the options! I'll definitely go here again if I'm looking for some yummy and inexpensive pizza!"}
{"text":"A new concept but a great one! You get to pick a pizza or pick your own toppings for one low price. They had a lot of sauces, cheeses and toppings. I got 3 cheeses and a variety of toppings. I loved how fresh it is and crisp the dough is. Additionally it's fired up fast so no long wait at all! This is a great idea and I hope it comes to Maryland soon."}
{"text":"Fast fresh and all you can add pizza
Chipotle style , everything about it is awesome

Have been here 3 times in a week already that how good it is

Unlimited toppings , chose your crush and see magic happen in front of
Your eyes 

Will not let this one go

If you like a 2$ slice go to pizza pizza"}
{"text":"Was it the best pizza I've ever eaten?  Hardly.  The sauce is bland and the cheese and toppings were minimal.  However, for the price and the actual concept is great.  The service was fast and friendly (I think they have way too many people working for the product the offer) It's a new restaurant so only time will tell how it will pan out.  Anywhere where I can feed a family of 4 for $25 that isn't mcD burgers and fries is a winner in my book.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good concept...plenty of fresh tasty and healthy topping options...diff. sauce and cheese options as well. I really enjoy this place...even when there is a wait"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. First time trying this and love the concept. Real friendly staff. Very fresh ingredients and great size pizza for a good value as well. It's make your own or they have a few favorites. I did a make your own and it was absolutely delicious. Will be back to this place for sure in the future and hope to see them grow to more places."}
{"text":"I've never seen a place waste so much food. They messed up the order for the person in front of me, so they threw away perfectly fine dough and toppings. My pizza was burnt twice and I would have complained but I was so hungry at that point. The pizza WAS actually good even though the bottom was burnt so I'd label this place a dice roll."}
{"text":"Fast food pizza...that's essentially what it is.  And they do a really good job of it. For the price, it is some of the best pizza I've had.  Let me make that clear - it's not the best pizza I've ever had, but the best for the price.  I love that you can add toppings without being forged, too.

Everyone raves about the service...but, I am not that impressed.  Granted I've only gone during \"rush hour\", and it was crazy busy both times. But, they do smile and seem the genuinely wish you a good evening."}
{"text":"Ok so I had my blaze experience a few weeks ago, and every since then I have LOVED IT!!! There is an employee there by the name of Greg.. he is the absolute BEST PERSON EVER. I have been there so much that I swear he knows my order by heart!!! He is always polite. He greets everyone when they walk in.. and he makes every visit a GREAT EXPERIENCE!!! I love this place.. it's always clean, and the food is amazing!! Keep up the great work and give GREG a RAISE!!!"}
{"text":"We heard they had good gluten free crust and the wife loves her some pizza. 
I have to say the pizza here is great!

There is a big menu board with toppings, crust, ETC and they have some signature pizzas. The wife said her GF pizza was very good. I had the ART (artichokes, ricotta and tomatoes) and it was delicious. Pizzas came out in less than 10 minutes.

The staff is super friendly too!

The decor is very laid back and modern. 

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok so I have tried the 3 build your own pizza places.  Pieology, blaze, and pizzarev. Blaze is awesome! By far the best BBQ chicken, which is my favorite. As far as pizza in general goes. Not the same as a real Italian or New York type pizza. But pretty good for a quick pizza fix."}
{"text":"Excellent flat crust pizza, build your own on gluten free or regular crust. Big selection of cheese, toppings, and meat!! Love it here!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong. We used to love pieology, but blaze is the same concept but better. Huge selection of toppings. Friendly staff. Pizza is crazy good and we absolutely needed something like this in our neighborhood. That blood orange lemonade is AMAZING. Is buy it by the gallon of the sold it."}
{"text":"My fiancee and i loved the food! Honestly the sweetest people to ever help me!! I highly recommend if you want pizza go here and enjoy the amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered gluten free, it came out perfect and crispy like a yummy chip base.
Hubby ordered the high rise and it came out perfect too!

The guys on tonite were on point!!! Made sure our pizzzas were exactly the way we wanted it!!

Thanks guys! The pizzas hit the spot!!"}
{"text":"The staff tonite did an awesome job. The best blaze in the valley so far. The girl was turning our super stacked w topping pizza on the super rise crust. The crust came out perfect! Crispy but soft when you bite into it. The dough was cooked throughout. Thank you for a great experience. Def worth the 32 min drive here. We live close to a blaze. 10 min drive but prefer this location. Job well done!!!"}
{"text":"Blaze pizza pays homage to classic roman style pizza; which presents itself with thin and crackly crusts. They have a subway style of service, where you can either order an a la carte or make-your-own pizza.

Blaze pizza falls short of great in many ways, but in the end, they do their job. Similar to Arcadians supporting the 300 Spartan soldiers, Blaze pizza is overshadowed by famous brazen Neapolitan style pizzerias around the city. King Leonidas from the movie '300' describes the ungainly Arcadians with, \"They make a wondrous mess of things. Brave amateurs, they do their part.\" - (refer to https://youtu.be/fRK3bJtDAjg?t=116). Their effort is humbling, but comes short due to their price, portion size and taste.

Their sauce is bit too acidic to my taste, which is barely balanced by the lack of cheese. To some, their sauce can be a little too salty as well. With a three minute cook time, their crust is great while its hot. Although their toppings are not generous, it does satisfy the simplistic nature of the roman style pizza. 

For the price you are paying, Blaze pizza will do the job... But you can spend a bit more and get authentic tasting pizza around the corner(s).

3/5"}
{"text":"The Chipotle of pizza- you order and watch them build your pizza like you would a burrito. The menu of pre-built pizza and the options for building your own are solid. Multiple base sauce options and a variety of veggies and meats ensure that you can create something you'll like. Even though there was a crowd we got through the line, placed our order and received our food fairly quickly. The crust of the pizza is thin, it has to be for them to cook them as fast as they do, but it's good. The 11 inch personal pizzas are a pretty good deal and if you build your own you can put an unlimited variety of toppings on it. Not the most high quality ingredients I've ever had on a pizza but still good. 

Overall, I liked Blaze. It's a nice compromise between Domino's and Grimaldi's. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here after hiking with some friends. We were starving. The service was quick which was what we needed. I ordered the green stripe which was delicious. It was not like normal pizza which has marinara/tomato sauce but a delicious pesto sauce instead. My friends ordered the meat lover and other pizzas. I don't remember the exact names but it doesn't really matter because they were all good. And the other great thing about this place is you can basically add as many toppings as you want!"}
{"text":"By far the most amazing pizza I've had. I got mine with the Daiya vegan cheese and sooo many toppings. It was absolutely divine, and already craving it again!"}
{"text":"So I went in to your establishment last night and your employee Maria was the being very rude to a couple of guests that were trying to order.  She was also a bit short with us but not nearly as bad as she was being with the other two.  It was very obvious the guests were getting aggravated trying to order their food and she was replying what seemed to be very sassy remark's. Even after the two young gentleman received their food she continued out onto the floor and actually touched his wallet and his cell phone while they were eating. She was totally harassing them while they were just sitting quietly trying to eat their dinner. I think that management needs to intervene and teach Maria and maybe coach her a better way on how to speak to guests and how to keep her hands to herself. Very poor service and I'm sure you lost a few patrons last night"}
{"text":"BEST STAFF AND PIZZA EVER. 

Thank you, Ryan and Chris 
for the amazing customer service.

#noleftovers"}
{"text":"Great pizza and it was quick!!
You get to pick all of your ingredients, and there is a plethora of choices. 
I asked for mine to have the crust done crispy and the server/cook made sure I was happy with what came out.  
Service and the employees were helpful and seemed to be having a good time while offering great customer service. 
I'd definitely recommend this as a pizza option!!"}
{"text":"Typical blaze, yummy as always.  Tons of options to choose from when building your own pizza or salad.  Lines move pretty fast, pricing is fair for the portion sizes.  Always kept nice and clean and looks very modern inside.  Slightly overcrowded with tables and chairs, but it's pretty necessary for how packed they get."}
{"text":"If you don't like your pizza it is your fault since you pick your toppings.
They were very uncoordinated when we went, but it was a fund raiser night.
Staff was very happy"}
{"text":"This place has recently opened and we went there one day for lunch. I love the idea of this place, especially the build-your-own-pizza thing with unlimited toppings, but I think they were still going through growing pains when we went because their service was slow and they burnt my one friend's pizza and then took forever to remake it. They have online ordering, where you can order your pizza(s) online and they will prepare the uncooked pizza and have them waiting for you. Once you arrive and pay, they'll fire the pizza for you so it's fresh and doesn't get soggy sitting there! I think the online ordering might be faster than trying to order in person so that you don't need to wait in line. As for the pizza itself, it was ok. The crust was thin but I didn't think it was very flavourful and I think burns very easily in their oven (especially the gluten free ones I observed). They were relatively generous with their toppings - except for cheese, which is fine by me because I don't particularly care for cheese. But if you do love cheese, you might want to ask for a bunch of different kinds so that the small amounts of each separate kind might add up to a more substantial amount at the end. The spicy sauce is quite spicy - much spicier than I expected. The rest of the toppings were fine and overall my creation tasted pretty good. Overall, I think Blaze has a great concept but their execution could use some refining, although I'm sure it's better by now. Definitely check it out if you are in the area for lunch!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas this is a must go! For less than $10 you can make your own pizza and add as many high quality toppings you want. I recommend the salami, bacon, and pepperoni with whatever veggies you want. The dough is made fresh and the sauces are flavorful. The staff had the pizzas out to us in less than 15 mins!"}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is by far the best pizza in town 100% custom made wood fired great service I recommend it for sure"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here 2x's now and had great food each time. First I made my own, and the second I had a bbq chicken per their recommendation. I don't even really like bbq chicken pizza, but this was great! Can't beat the pricing either. Blood orange lemonade was good too, but if you're prone to heartburn then steer clear. It's very acidic!"}
{"text":"Blaze pizza is one of our favorite pizza places. So, when we were looking for a casual place to celebrate my mom's birthday with 20+ people, we knew it would be perfect, especially since tha restaurant offers gluten and dairy free options. We talked with the manager beforehand, who was extremely nice and accommodating. When we arrived he had already sectioned off an area of the restaurant for us and he even had pre prepared some gluten free crusts for members of our group. All of the staff were very nice and as always the pizza was delicious. Thank you so much Blaze Pizza for making that evening enjoyable and stress free."}
{"text":"This place is seriously legit. Yes, we came on opening day and yes, we waited an hour for free pizza. It was worth every minute--everyone who works here was friendly, funny and had amazing attitudes.  The pizza was fantastic and best part--they don't up-charge for toppings.  I'm usually not a fan of \"chain\" restaurants but I'm thoroughly impressed. Great chill spot in Southend--finally I can stop saying there's only crappy overpriced pizza in South End (I'm talking to you, Fuel). :-)"}
{"text":"Love this joint. Fabulous food that is always fast and fresh. You build your pizza with whatever toppings you want, and they are generous. It's a low-key environment and it's  always clean. The staff are amazing! Eddie always remembers my name and has a million-dollar smile. He goes out of his way to ensure you get what you want. He's great with the rest of the staff, too. Tyler G. took really good care of us in the dining room. He bused tables like a madman, checked in on us, and offered me a box when it was obvious that (as usual) I would have to take home half off my pizza. Blaze does it right."}
{"text":"I sincerely love this place. My husband and I plan at least one visit a month. Even when it's crazy busy, the service is fast and friendly. The food is amazing. They have every topping imaginable, except anchovies. Not sure why they don't have anchovies, because they literally have everything else. Seriously, they have half a dozen different cheeses several meats, and even fake meat. Veggies would love it here. They have every vegetable you would ever want to put on a pizza, including fresh basil and two different kinds of olives. They have several different sauces, including white, spicy, and even pesto. My favorite topping? The roasted garlic. Then, once you get your nice hot pizza, they have giant jars chili peppers, Parmesan  and oregano that you can shake on the top of your masterpiece. I have never had a bad experience here. And, even though it is supposed to be a personal pizza, mine ends up being two, sometimes three, meals. This pizza is great cold, too. Even their salad is good! It is also really cool that all the employees wear name tags on their hats so that you can get to know them and develop a rapport. The place is always clean and has a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was quick, fun, and such good pizza. Similar to chipotle, you move down the line and choose what you want on the pizza and it comes out super fast and super tasty! Perfect lunch spot"}
{"text":"Fire baked pizza made right before you're eyes! Tons of topping combos to choose from! Lovely patio space perfect for people watching! Friendly staff! And if you're in a hurry, they offer online ordering!"}
{"text":"Our first visit was a Saturday at 6pm.  Upon entering the first thing you notice is that the doors are full of fingerprints and the floor is dirty (see pics).  Staff (5 high school age individuals) were pleasant but and explained the menu as this was our first visit to a Blaze pizza. We selected our pizza ingredients and into the oven they went. The pick up station was also rather messy with crumbs and detritus all over the counter.  The pizza looked great and tasted just as good as it looked. The spicy red sauce does have some heat to it, but not too much, so beware, but it is great if you like hot. UNfortunately, while we were eating we saw an adult customer ordering by putting both arms on the top of the sneeze guard and hang her head and forearms over the sneeze guard to point out what she wanted. The staff said nothing. It was so over-the-top my buddy took a picture and will post it in his review. Overall, the pizza was good but the cleanliness and sanitary concerns will cause me to hesitate to return so just two stars. In the interest of fairness I did ask a staff member to speak to a manager but after 15 min of waiting we had to leave.  There are some valid health concerns with cleanliness and customers hanging over the counters :( pity too.  I liked the pizza but the staff are young and need better oversight, management and instruction. Health concerns have also been identified by other reviewers (Carrie B for one)."}
{"text":"Newly opened and well staffed. Pizza is good and the arugula salad tasty. Good for a quick bite. Manager Jared is a very nice guy."}
{"text":"Happy Pi day. Great food and service as always. They were busy but moved fast and everyone was doing something to make it go faster. Build your own with pesto and spicy sauce for the win"}
{"text":"Love the sauce here and the crust is nice and crispy and thin, with a solid flavor. Was my first time and was pleasantly surprised with how yummy it was, and how quickly it was ready. Has a Chipotle, or which wich style set up where you can build ur own pizza and they toss it in the (fire) oven at the end, was quick, easy, and delicious. Black olives had a bit of a strange flavor, but didn't put me off my pizza at all. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is by far my Favorite Blaze .. my son is a bit pizza obsessed ...add on OCD and I just have to say I  can't thank the staff at this location enough .. every time I'm here I end up getting great service and having a good time while picking out all the different toppings ..

Communicate with who is making your pizza and I assure you they will make it how you like it and don't forget to tip if you get the good service because honestly everyone I've come across here is typically great!so if they aren't having a good day it's probably due to some customer made it that way ..

Be warned it gets busy especially on the weekends. Don't let that surprise you and avoid it if that is an issue but they usually try to get thru the line really fast !

Huge shout out to Eddie .P who helped take my initial order and made sure everyone down the line knew we were here to have Blaze save the Day and let me tell you they did from Xavier and Devin who made my sons pizza pie perfect and Shawn who brought out and boxed it up they turned my sons frown upside down and he ate it all up and we left with a smile! 

Prior visits Kenya has always been a rockstar too!

Overall whoever is building this team it definitely has an awesome culture !"}
{"text":"This is my favorite build your own pizza spot in Charlotte. The build your own is my favorite, you can pick unlimited toppings for your pizza as well as the type of sauce you would like. And I always get my pizza well done. It never fails to satisfy my pizza craving."}
{"text":"One of my fav places to eat, will only eat pizza from blaze! I'm vegan so I like they can accommodate that as well as use certain cutters and changes gloves when working with my vegan pizza!"}
{"text":"This place has always been delicious and when I took my family last night they delivered again.  However, I was upset with the staff.  I had to wipe down the table myself so I could have a clean table.  The restaurant was filthy which is usually not the case.  I understand sometimes it's hard to keep up but last night they had no reason.  Behind the counter was probably 10-12 young adults talking and laughing and the restaurant was filthy.  The lines were the shortest I've ever seen but instead of cleaning up the staff felt like joking in the back was more important.  I gave it 3 stars because this is the first time I've had a bad experience here but it was definitely upsetting."}
{"text":"I'm starting to not like this place. They apparently don't know how to cook their gluten free pizzas, it's been multiple times that my pizza has come out burnt. I also did online ordering, said my pizzas would be done at 7:05, got there at 6:55, and my pizzas weren't done till 7:30. Mise well not offer this service. All n all, it's just been very irritating here, maybe hire a few more adults and not so many younglings who need a lot more training."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to review this one because I simply wanted to try as many things as possible before doing so. The first pizza I had at Blaze was \"Build Your Own\", and I went crazy. Red sauce, two different types of mozzarella, turkey meatballs, chicken, olives, banana peppers....I can keep going but I can't remember it all lol! This delicious concoction went into a wood fired oven and was topped off with a pesto drizzle at the end! Wow, It was great! 

I told myself that if I can literally throw the kitchen sink of ingredients they have to offer on a pizza and it taste as good as it did, then their signature specialties must be great too. After numerous visits, I've tried their \"Art Lover\", the \"White Top\", the \"Veg Out\", and the \"Green Stripe\". All of these variations have different flavor profiles, and are very unique. I can say I thoroughly enjoyed each of the ones I tried. Full of flavor, great textures, and just the right temperature when it comes out the oven. 

Blaze Pizza uses fresh ingredients, and everything is made to order. The layout is pretty much like the \"Subway\" or \"Pita Pit\" of pizzas, where all of the toppings are laid out in front of you to choose from, and a person behind the counter builds the pizza. When you order the pizza for take out, they wait to throw it in the wood fire oven until you get there so that way you can add ingredients to your pizza and make sure it's made exactly to your liking. I also love their finishing touches. You can get drizzles like BBQ sauce, Balsamic Vinaigrette, and Pesto on top of your pizza once it comes out the oven. 

The pies are individual, but you can surely share one with someone and still be full depending on what you get on top of the pizza.

Prices are very reasonable too! You can get a pie and a fountain drink for under $10! 

There really isn't anything bad I can say about this place. It's really unique, affordable, convenient, and can function as a lunch or dinner option. 

I recommend Blaze with utmost confidence!"}
{"text":"Such a good experience today when I went in the first time! Every employee was seriously so friendly! The manager was even working the line and joking with the customers. I was so surprised by how sweet the staff is! Every employee seemed genuinely happy and they all had smiles on their faces. Good pizza at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Food quality A plus.  Service & attitude C minus - rush, rush, rush.  Too small an eating area.  We go to the one by the galleria mall - service and attitude A.  What a difference, the contrast is obvious between these two locations.  Service and attitude make all the difference."}
{"text":"I enjoy trying new restaurants. I could not recommend any place without trying it first. Saw an ad in the paper about the location on Eastern...about 3 miles away. As luck would have it I received a free coupon in the mail for the one on ring road at the Galleria mall. This was about 4 pm on Wed. Walked in and there was a very small line which moved very quickly. Believe it or not there were 12 employees behind the counter literally shoulder to shoulder. Placed my order with the first person..who then moved the plate to the next person about 1 inch away..she placed the sauce ..then moved it to the next person..another inch away..and added the cheese...then to next person another inch away..to add more stuff...then again and again. They need to get rid of half or more of these pizza movers. 
The quality ??  What quality ???  Burnt edges..lack of taste. On the low end their product cannot even compete with a frozen product. 
Oddly enough the best pizza Napoli Pizza is located very near by. I would crawl on my hand and knees to go the distance from Blaze to Napoli. Additionally Napoli offers a large pie for the same price and a ton of lunch specials for $7.95. 
I can honestly say that I would have felt ripped off if I had to pay. Thank you for the free coupon. 
I cannot recommend Blaze."}
{"text":"They have a good variety of pizzas and sides. The pizza was very good and still tasted great the day after."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places(: 
Their blood orange lemonade is incredible and they are one of the only pizza places I've found with vegan options."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place. Located in a convenient area. Clean and very affordable. You can create your own pizza with unlimited ingredients, however, this is not the great part about building your own pizza for me. It is that they have amazing ingredients and FINALLY I can eat the pizza I want. So, I made my own pizza and it was great! The staff is friendly and the ambiance is nice and comfortable. They do not serve alcohol yet, at least when I was there three weeks ago, but on their menu it states that they will serve beer and wine.

Once they do that, I will increase my visits because a great pizza and a glass of wine will be wonderful. They also have outdoor seating and this might be great to sit outside and sip a glass of wine and eat wonderful pizza when the sun goes down and the cute joggers pass you."}
{"text":"Good and experience was great!!! Adding this place to my list of frequent restaurant to go to!! Pizza was just enough for me to be content and I don't have the guilt feeling of eating a greasy or unhealthy pizza. Pizza was great tasting and refreshing!"}
{"text":"We were here on opening night. Amazing pizza. Crust is crisp and they have a huge list of toppings. They were super busy but the line moved fast and the staff was so friendly. The Art lover pizza was delicious as well as the White Top. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for pizza."}
{"text":"I come here for their lemonades and veggie pizzas! I usually order the bbq chicken pizza no chicken with extra sauce. My bf typically gets the green stripe and they always come out perfect. They are consistent and I highly suggest downloading their blaze app if you frequent it often. You can rack up \"flames\" which in turn gives you a free drink or pizza."}
{"text":"I got a coupon in the mail for a free pizza so I thought \"why not?\".  We when I walked I was immediately greeted by pretty much all the staff which was nice. It was my first time in so the young man explained how it works, which was helpful. They have 7 or 8 signature pizza or you can do the build our own - which is the option I chose. You go down the line - unlimited topping by they way, then they pop it in the oven and in 5 minutes you're ready to go! Ate the pizza when I got home and it was really good! I will definitely be coming back when I have that pizza urge! Also, they offer gluten free dough."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! It was after 2pm and this place had a line out the door. You order in a subway-like fashion.. I ordered 2 specialty pizzas (red vine and white top) plus 2 drinks only $20! 

The pizza was delicious! Much tastier than little Cesar's or Cici's. I am define going back to try all the other kinds. It's very inexpensive but tastes great!"}
{"text":"This place is the shizz....I messed up on my online order and LIZZY the cashier was more than accommodating above my expectations.  Thank you for the great, quick and awesome service/pizza. And then JOHN was cool while cutting my pizza. Cool dude and super friendly."}
{"text":"Blaze is a super casual, make your own pizza place. The pizzas came out fairly quickly, and it was relatively cheap too.  Efficient assembly line.

Have been looking forward to this place finally opening since hearing about it. The area has several other pizza options in proximity however this is the a much different concept than traditional pizza. The Build your own $8.25 option allows to use unlimited toppings. You also have the option of the standard thin, a rising crust or gluten free. 

Two things I would do differently:
Avoid the balsamic drizzle as it was quite strong and took over the flavor of some of the pizza. 
Get a drink. I opted for water but saw several delicious looking lemonade and juice options."}
{"text":"this place was a madhouse. I don't think I will ever return to this location. I asked for a gluten free pizza and I added my toppings and everything was fine. I waited about ten minutes to finally pay for my pizza. another 15 minute passed and I still had not gotten my food. the woman that was at the oven called my name and asked me what was on the pizza I had ordered and I told her. she then walked back to the front of the line and proceeded to tell the guy assembling that they needed to \"re-fire\" my pizza as it was burnt. was there an apology? nope. was there some kind of communication? nope. she didn't even take the time to look at me or say anything. I understand that it was in the middle of a rush, but some communication or acknowledgement of my presence or that they burnt my food would have been nice. instead, I was ignored and I had to wait an additional 20 minutes for my food. I was offered the burnt pizza to take home and I accepted, only so that I could see exactly how \"burnt\" it was. in all honesty, the pizza was not burnt, but a little charred around the edges, and if the woman watching the pizzas in the over would have been like \"I'm sorry this isn't how we do things, we burnt your pizza, would you like me to make you another one?\" I would have asked to see the pizza, and been okay with it. but no, instead she went on speaking out loud how she needed help because they had to re-fire two pizzas as they were burnt, that there was no dough made, that a lot of the toppings were running out, and that they were really busy. I hope she has a better day tomorrow... on the other hand, should out to Gabby, who was able to maintain her cool through everyone that came in at the same time. When she handed me the \"re-fire\" she said thank you for my patience, and she was sorry."}
{"text":"This place had lots of space and it was clean.  The customer service was great.  It was similar in taste to Eklectic Pie in Chandler.  There are better options in the area for this \"quick fired\" pizza concept."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! Came here with the family and had a great experience! I think it's about $8 to get a pizza with unlimited toppings. The workers were really friendly here. We enjoyed being able to point and pick out whatever we wanted on our pizza that was being made in front of us. We went to check out and got a couple of s'mores for dessert and the cashier said we can just come back for them when we were done so they can heat it up for us, so nice. The pizzas were pretty good. I really liked the crust, it was really light and crispy. The toppings were a bit bland but you can't complain much when it's so cheap lol the guy on the floor was constantly cleaning tables and he came and asked us how everything was and took our plates. Finally it was time for the s'mores for dessert and they were delicious. We had a good time there and left feeling full and satisfied. I'm glad this is close to my parents house, it's a great go to place for a cheap, quick, and yummy meal."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and have been to blaze countless times.  Although each experience is more of a trainwreck than the previous one... I  unfortunately sucommb to what's convenient, quick and close.

I'll admit the pizza is good... but everything else is a miserable. 

when the line crew is not loudly talking about their personal lives, moving at a snail pace or spelling Michelle like Mitchel... they are telling me how high they are.

we've also had some one literally clock out and forget our pizza is in the oven( this has happened twice by the way).  can't make this stuff up.

the shift manager (whoever wears the collared shirt) usually is partaking in whatever bad behavior is going on. I guess if you can't beat em join em.

I actually never leave reviews... but Blaze is undeniably the worst customer service  I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Another new restaraunt in Summerlin and Vegan friendly!! I walked in one night to check out this place after hearing their chain had a great reputation. I was immediately greeted and after staring at the menu for a minute, the kind employee asked if this was my 1st time in. I said yes so then he started telling me about the menu. I told him I was vegan so he said both crusts, regular and gluten free, are both vegan friendly and I jumped straight to my order.

I did a Build Your Own pizza and you're allowed as many toppings as you would like. They offer Daiya cheese but I went no cheese but extra red sauce. They offer \"chicken sausage\" and offered me a taste of it but I went the loaded with veggies route and they filled that puppy up. At the end of preparing the pizza, they place it in a fire burning oven for few mins and ask if there are any additional sauces or toppings you would like. 

The pizza came out great! I've been back a few times now and every pizza is been delicious.  This is a spacious restaraunt with a cute patio attached."}
{"text":"Not for me. I am a first timer. Girl (Sasha) who helped us and explained was great she was all smiles and took her time. The girl who prepped it (Sarah, I believe) was just not a happy camper. She had the longest face ever and barley put any toppings. Food was good but customer service, eh! 3 stars for me."}
{"text":"I have been here many, many times, and can't believe I have never written a review! 

My hubby and I stumbled upon Blaze Pizza one day driving by and we were hungry. We have been hooked since. 

It's almost like a Subway, but with pizza. You walk in and tell them which pizza you want. You can choose a plain one, a build your own, or one of their specialties. You can even choose gluten free dough! You then can add anything you want down the line, including extra meats, at no extra charge! Items include peperoni, bacon, ricotta cheese, mushrooms, tomatoes, red peppers, garlic, etc. Then they fire up the pizza while you wait. Only takes a couple of minutes. 

There is also an assortment of salads, beers, or a little smores pie for dessert. 

We love this place. The food is great, the prices are good, and we like the atmosphere. It's always busy, so you know it's good!"}
{"text":"My god I wished I discovered this place sooner. Who doesn't love a \"Customize Your Own\" pizza priced right with unlimited toppings? It almost shames me for all the times I've eaten at places like Grimaldi's and seeing my check stack up due to basic add-ins. This place is fresh, fast and personable. The staff really goes above and beyond for your satisfaction whether you're a regular or not. Most importantly, the pizzas are unbelievably amazing! Even when you top your pizza to the fullest capacity, the crust still comes out crunchy. And that's a pizza feature I take seriously."}
{"text":"The only reason I go back is because food is good. Service was below par again and ruined the food. We usually get a veggie pizza & a meet pizza. The vegetarian pizza cannot have any meat on it and since they don't wipe their pizza cutters in between pizza we started to ask them to not cut it.

Last time we went in, I used the mobile app and place two separate orders so they surely could not mess up which pizza was not to be cut. Well guess what...they cut the veggie pizza(we found a small piece of sausage on it) and they didn't cut the meat. How can you mess this up so many times.

I don't want to have to manage the employees, but when they get busy...they make a lot of mistakes, plus they forget the BBQ & Pesto drizzle even that it was on the online order ticket! Even the note for NO CUT was on it.

Very frustrating...hire more people so they can execute during the busy times please! I love the food so much that I really want to continue to eat here, but if this poor execution continues, I'm going to have to go back to domino's...

Please fix!!!"}
{"text":"Blaze is consistently fresh and fast. However the speed here is slower than most and for that reason no 4 star."}
{"text":"I attended the Yelp Elite party at Blaze last night and I was thoroughly impressed. The owners are so enthusiastic and friendly and you can tell that they're treating their staff well because every staff member appeared happy and that translates into excellent service. Going to Blaze is a full experience...above and beyond just a restaurant. The staff were actually singing in unison at one point :)

The interior is comfortable, ultra clean, and the space is cleverly designed. Blaze has ample outdoor seating.

Now, about the pizza. I know I've mentioned this in other reviews, but again, I grew up in Chicagoland, I spent the last 9 yrs.in Metro NYC, and I've eaten a lot of pizza in Italy. So, I'm a very picky pizza eater. Here's what Blaze has going for it: this is really good pizza dough and it's coal fired right there in front of you. This crust is actually the real deal. But possibly of greater importance is the fact that the staff is really looking out for you as you build your own pizza. We used to frequent 2 coal fired pizza places that were very highly regarded in the NYC area (Cassie's and Brooklyn's). Both good places, unless you ordered more than 2 toppings in which case the chefs allowed your pizza to become hopelessly soggy.

Here at Blaze there are 40 toppings (preservative free, by the way - no nitrites, etc!). Last night I must have ordered half of them on my pizza and the chefs had my back. They added the correct quantity in the correct order and there wasn't a bit of sogginess to the bottom layer of my pizza's crust!

Their toppings are of high quality and you pay the same price regardless of how many toppings you get...seriously! My pizza was under $8 and it included marinara, fresh mozzarella, ricotta, Parmesan, bacon, smoked ham, Italian sausage, black olives, mushrooms, bell pepper, spinach, artichoke hearts, purple onion, and tomatoes. Absolutely delicious.

Their packaging materials are minimalist and recyclable, these guys are far more eco friendly than most restaurants. 

Their salads, s'mores cookies, and blood orange lemonade (all house made!) totally deserve honorable mention. 

What is not to love about Blaze?! I am so impressed by this place and will most certainly be back :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It's normally pretty busy but you won't be in line that long. There's about 6-7 people in the front where you order so once you're up it goes by quick. I remembered when this place first opened and thinking how cool it was that it was like a subway or chipotle but for Pizza! So cool! Anyway if you haven't been totally worth going too. Super adorable and it's a very cute and rustic looking place."}
{"text":"This has become our favorite pizza joint. You can design anything you want as far as Pizza is concerned. Our favorite is classic red sauce, mozzarella and parmesan cheeses, mushrooms, sauteed onions, roasted red peppers and sauteed zucchini. When it comes out of the oven we have them top it with a little bit of pesto sauce. Outstanding pizza!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the price! I love that you can customize your own little personal pizza & they have the best toppings! It's crowded but the line moves fast."}
{"text":"Great and quick service!you can definitely make it worth the price. I recommend the build your own for best value"}
{"text":"I've been getting pizza here since they opened. The service and quality have one down significantly. The cheese on the Simple Pie was burnt. How do you mess up a cheese pizza? Just sayin."}
{"text":"I tried this place begrudgingly because some friends wanted to go. I'd had Pizza Rev before and hated their bland, oily, flavorless crust. When I walked into Blaze and saw the exact same pressure dough smasher machine, I winced and prepared for more of the same. Happily, I was mistaken! I dunno what they do different (maybe they season their dough or make it thicker) but it was quite good! Plus they have different types of juices/lemonades to try not just fountain soda."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a rainy afternoon after doing some shopping. I came in and the restaurant was a little less than half full. I was greeted by a friendly employee who asked if this was my first time. I've been to Blaze a few times in the past, but this was my first time at this location. I'm always pleased with the freshness of their ingredients. I will be honest in saying that the employees have a tendency to move a little slower than normal. I'm not expecting them to rush through preparing the food, but if everyone picked up the pace, just a half of a notch, it could take them far! I did notice that everyone was working diligently and there wasn't any standing around and chit chatting. I like to see when everyone works as a team and is keeping up with their responsibilities. They somehow got backed up after a guest ordered online and there was an error with the system so he ended up with a duplicate order of all of his pizzas. This caused an additional wait but overall the experience was worth the wait. I ordered the create your own pizza with pepperoni, crushed garlic, spinach, and pesto drizzle and my pizza tasted amazing and I will definitely be back soon! The prices are reasonable and I can definitely taste a difference in the quality of their ingredients."}
{"text":"I went in during their first few weeks of being open and can I just say their food is amazing. I got a BBQ chicken pizza and it was made just how I wanted it. The staff were absolutely great and friendly. Their pizzas are about $6 which isn't bad for the size you get. Can't wait to go back and get some! :)"}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to give Blaze Pizza a try.  The concept remind me of &pizza in DC (which is delicious). I decided to Build My Own Pizza. The servers were very stingy with the toppings. I had to ask for more topping on everything on my pizza. The server said that customers are always asking for more. As for the pizza, it was ready in less than 5 minutes. However, it was ok. Nothing special. It's not something that I will be telling all my friends about."}
{"text":"Thanks Blaze for having vegan cheese!!!! My 11 year old got enjoy pizza with the rest of his family today and it was awesome! I'm not going to lie I was a little worried about how it was going to taste, but he loved it. He ate the whole pizza. Recently we discovered he had a dairy intolerance. He had been missing pizza this last month so you guys really made his day. The girl who helped us even changed her gloves to handle my son's pizza without being asked. Thanks for going above and beyond!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. We call it the Chipotle of pizza. Fantastic. Cheap!! Good toppings! Gluten free crust! Pesto sauce is my favorite. Beer selection is good!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok for a quick bite...but having authentic pizza with flavor, need go italian restaurant.
May or may not come back....fast n easy though."}
{"text":"*** The owner reached out to me personally to make things right. With him running this store I have no doubt things will be improved! It's nice to see someone that takes pride in their work."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this place is a serious addiction! My husband and I come from New England where the pizza is right up there with NY pizza and this place trumps every other pizza joint in the valley.

Unlimited toppings, THAT ARE FRESH, such good prices, and friendly staff. You really can't get any better!"}
{"text":"I love build your own pizza joints! This was the third place I've tried here in the valley. I would rate it as number 2 out of 3.

They have vegan cheese and other veggie options which is always a plus. The crust is delicious and the pesto spread is too. 

I would say they don't have enough ingredients to choose from though...compared to Pieology. Overall, it's tasty and the service was great!"}
{"text":"So we ordered 3 take out pizzas.  Two had things missing or were completely wrong from my online order.  One was correct. However the dough was very burnt on the edges and the little dough bubbles that form when cooking were not edible.  Disappointed for sure maybe will try again in a couple month when they work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Great Valentine's Day dinner with my daughter!! They were super friendly!!  Great time and friendly!!  Delicious pizzas!!  Thank you so much for a delicious dinner!!"}
{"text":"This is my fav pizza place. Lines are usually long (that means their good) but they have a great system and get you through quickly. All individual or sharable sizes. I love the \"build your own\". The ingredients are right in front of you. You pick them. Several sauces to choose from. Lots of meats and many veggies. Very clean restaurant. Great staff. Especially Chase. He can be found  interacting with guest and he's always busy. When ordering don't forget the blood orange lemonade. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Like the Chipotle of pizza...fast service and the pizzas I've ordered have been good.  Only complaint about this location is if you are dining the acoustics are horrible...hard to hear the employees building the pizzas and it's like sitting in a gym when eating...some sound baffling on the ceiling would help tremendously."}
{"text":"Finally I can eat as many version's I want, this pizza place is worth every penny. I really appreciate how the staff members help each other with smile, this place is a better environment for friends"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza with lots of choices for toppings and not just the basics. They had several varieties of cheese, meat like bacon, meatballs, sausage as well as veggies like arugula, artichoke, cherry tomatoes, caramelized onions etc.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this place given the location at Dundas Square and wish I visited earlier. Great for a quick and casual meal.

We got a build-your-own as well as the Artist Lover pizza + 1 drink which had free refills. Total came out to ~$31. 

Service was very efficient and friendly. The staff was very well trained to accommodate the busy lines. 

I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Was asked to give Blaze a second chance and this time hubby and I were much happier with the pizzas we received.

This time we asked for our pizzas well done and the crust was much crispier.

The toppings and sauce were more generously covering the pizza and overall the pizza was much tastier.

Ordered on the app, which makes choosing toppings a breeze and they have it ready for your arrival and fired up the pizza when hubby arrived to pick it up. Blazing fast food!

It was not as busy as last time so I wonder if the fact that they were swamped at our last visit had a negative effect on the quality?

A much happier experience this time, so we will definitely be back and try some different combinations, but hubby loves the spicy sauce so    he will always start with that.

------------------



Hubby and I didn't enjoy the pizza at Blaze.

The crust is very chewy and not crisp at all.

Even worse was the scant toppings.  We didn't want that many different toppings but it seems like they put only a tiny bit of each topping no matter if you pick 3 toppings or 30 toppings, so there wasn't even Italian sausage crumbles and onion on each slice.

I got pesto sauce and it was bland and very little of it, even though I also requested pesto drizzle after it was baked... hubby said his tomato sauce was better but not amazing.

My pizza was thick crust so it took longer and yet they cooked both at the same time and hubby's pie sat waiting in its box getting cold waiting for mine to be ready.

Crazy long lineups, substandard pizza, and the chaos of Yonge Dundas square.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Yum.  New sauces.. new lemonades.. new salads.  This place just needs to add a pedicure corner and I could spend my whole day there"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place.  They have something for every pizza lover.  My pizza- pesto mix with marinara, olivini and mozerella cheeses, mushrooms & olives..yummm.  Great price for value.  And the lemonades and vane sugar sodas are good too."}
{"text":"Had the pepperoni pizza.  Service was good and efficient.  Pizza looked promising upon entering the oven.  Came out and the crust was a little too chewy and not cooked completely through.  The sauce wasn't very flavorful and lacked freshness in my opinion.  The pepperoni gave the pizza a nice kick of flavor."}
{"text":"Got free pizza on the 2nd opening day. It was a 2+ hr wait..totally worth it. Even if i wasn't free, it was less than 8 bucks with as much toppings as you like. Really fast to bake as well. They had this process down real well! I will always come back!"}
{"text":"Blaze is tucked in a nice busy section of town, and the service is fast and efficient. The thin crust pizzas are out in 90 seconds from the oven, and they have a great process cemented for DIY Pizza - think Subway, but elevated. The employees are trained to give you \"smileys\", and all the toppings and ingredients conveniently have caloric descriptions too (not that it affected my choice whatsoever to get three types of cheese and nearly all the meat options). I was slightly disappointed with their lemonade, wasn't personally a fan, and I later found out the cashier accidentally overcharged me for an extra lemonade. Ample room for seating, lively atmosphere with bright orange walls. Minimal cons other than that mishap. 

Pizza itself was good but nothing crazy - screams young Italian restaurant premium even though the price says differently (!), certainly better in taste and flavour complexity than the mass pizza joints (e.g. Pizza Pizza, Domino's). Open to coming back here but not particularly excited about it. For a pizza experience, there's a ton of better options in the city (Via Mercanti, Libretto etc). But for drunk food, I'd probably opt for $5 Pizza Pizza medium pizza that's almost just as tasty (I might be in the minority)."}
{"text":"Good, cheap, light pizza! This place is great! The staff are amazing and just really enjoyable people. Everyone is very personable and the whole experience ends up being fun. You can get a good sized pizza with unlimited toppings for less than $12. They also have a menu with different kinds of pizza if you don't trust your own decisions. 
The crust is amazing.. quite thin and light. They also have gluten free crust options. 
I would suggest you eat it in the shop as it tastes best hot and straight from the oven. 
One of my go-to places!"}
{"text":"Very good, and fastest pizza made. Me and my boyfriend came for the first time and built our own pizza. As much toppings as u like. It's nice opening up my pizza box and not seeing a shortage of toppings."}
{"text":"First time here. Came because of reviews. The service was excellent and friendly. I had a Ceaser salad which was standard and the pizza was tasty but the crust was soft. I prefer a crispy crust."}
{"text":"First time eating here and let me just say I was a little sceptical but took the plunge.. I ended up ordering online which was such an easy process. Pretty black and white no hangups easy layout of the online ordering via the website. My order was received instantly and my food was ready in less than 20 min. I ordered 2 pizzas both gluten free options for the crust and was I blown away. . I also ordered a salad as well and hands down the best salad I have had in a long time . The food here is delicious and I will definitely be back again. The customer service was top notch and very friendly staff?. Nice addition to the neighborhood here in Central Phoenix .. you won't be disappointed with any of the options your given to add to your pizza. Quality ingredients and quality service make this hot spot top of the list. Until next time.... Thanks you !"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Great prices, Love that they have healthy options and unlimited toppings. Even when it's busy inside the restaurant and the line is to the door they are still pretty quick! Always fresh pizza, never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. When you order here you have the choice of ordering their selection of pizzas which sounded good but I couldn't resist the array of toppings available and chose the build your own pizza. You can get as many toppings as you like for the same price. I decided on the basic red sauce with spinach artichoke hearts,smoked ham and mozzarella cheese. After your pizza is assembled you wait just a few minutes until it is delivered to you nice and hot. It was really good and tasted very fresh. We loved the blood orange lemonade too. There was a guy working in the dining room that was very helpful and nice. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because it was way too noisy in there. I think the music was way loud and everyone was trying to talk over it. So please if you turn down the music a notch this could very well turn out to be my new favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good, better than Pizza Rev.  Toppings are fresher and taste better.  

Soda machine is out of four flavors and ask the employees to change, over 15 minutes ago and it is still not changed.   There is no line, so I don't what is going on."}
{"text":"Love the Tempe location have been there several times. No problems there ever. I couldn't wait for this location to open I live across the street so much closer. Unfortunately this location is by far the worst I've ever scene. I've been twice, the first time waited in line for 30 min with only 5 people in front of me, once it was my turn they were out of most of the ingredients, still I was optimistic switched my pizza up to accommodate the ingredients they did have. After 8 min of waiting for my pizza to cook it came out  it looked like slop tasted like dookie. I asked for a refund because at that point, I was a bit terrified to eat the dookie pizza. They gave me a coupon and my money back. Just went in and redeemed my coupon tonight after months and my pizza was okay the wait was 30 min with four people a head of me and it just wasn't that great of an experience. I seriously feel bad for the staff they look  and talk to each other like they literally hate one another. They all looked confused like they haven't had more then 3 hours of training and they look so stressed I feel so bad for them, they really are trying, but you can tell the person running this joint does not give a shit about them."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time a month ago and the lemonade was soooo good, the prices were reasonable and the pizza was great and under 10$ !"}
{"text":"The hype is real - if you love thin crust, ample amount of toppings at your beck & call and all of it fired up to the perfect crispness, Blaze is the spot. I got a build-your-own with mushrooms, chicken, bacon, onions on a white sauce base with garlic pesto on the crust & it was wonderful! Staff were super friendly too which made the experience even more awesome!"}
{"text":"Great pizza
Great environment
They have a lot of people working and the food gets out quick
We love it here"}
{"text":"Came in with the family on 12/31/2017. The staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu. 

Ordered 4 pizzas and they were very delicious. 2 of them were  good ole fashion pepperoni. My wife had some weird veggie style pizza that didn't look all that good (but according to her, it was delicious). Mine was a typical meat lover's pizza. Can't go wrong with pepperoni, salami, spicy Italian sausage and jalapenos. The crust had this little hint of burnt that tied it all together.

Definitely worth the visit to this location in Tempe."}
{"text":"Dang I don't know how they managed to make the place look 10 times bigger on the inside. The building seems so small but you walk in there and they could host the entire neighborhood, impressive. Cool place overall, everything was cooked fine through and through. Took one star off just because the staff was really clumsy and didn't listen, we had to repeat everything two or three times and it wasn't even loud in there. I'm fine with it though, after all, it is still a new place and they just don't have their people down yet, but it did triple the order time and we were sorta in a rush. 

Cute take out boxes? Smart to make your boxes just in halves instead of offering styrofoam, good marketing since people see your labels again and much better for the environment :)"}
{"text":"Tried to get creative but there were limited options. The crust is limp and there is a lack if flavor in the red sauce. Its ok pizza. It wouldn't be my 1st choice or go-to pizza choice. 

The restaurant was clean though."}
{"text":"Perfect portion but limited options. The dough is not crisp and the sauce was a tad bit bland. It was just ok pizza. It wouldn't be my 1st choice or go-to but its a great option to hang with friends or let the kidz be creative."}
{"text":"Oh man. Finally found a great pizza spot.

Toppings are delicious, the crust is perfect and the menu is so simple.

I'll definitely be coming back often.

Can't complain about the prices as well. Very reasonable."}
{"text":"Visited on their free pizza day that I saw advertised online. Had to like their FB or Instagram to get a stamp on the hand for a free pizza. I was thoroughly impressed with all of the parts of my experience.

To start, the venue itself is spacious with lots of seating, including inside, semi outside, and outside. Everything was very clean - it's a brand new place, so it'd better be. The staff were extra friendly! They were also very efficient and effective at taking orders and making the pizzas. There were about 6-7 people ahead of us and 8-9 people behind us...it took about 6-7 min to place our order and another 5-6 minutes to receive our pizzas. During our experience, we had a staff member checking in on us, asking if we needed anything. 

I had the art lovers signature pizza - reg pizza dough, mozzarella, artichokes, ricotta dollops, tomato dollops (and I had sans garlic). I added basil too. This was my first experience at a make your own pizza joint. SO had a white sauce pizza w/ spinach, tomato, basil, mozzarella, and feta. Both pizzas were very delicious. The ingredients were fresh and pizzas cooked well. 

They definitely had all hands on deck the day I visited because of the free pizza. They really didn't skimp on the free pizza - what an amazing way to get your name out there and engage the community. Sometimes, places will advertise free stuff yet only give out a cheese pizza or something very basic. Blaze went all out and offered a full experience. I will be visiting again and recommending this location!

Also - they offer GF crusts & tons of veggie options!"}
{"text":"I visited on the grand opening day and I must say standing in line for almost two hours was well worth it! The employees were super friendly and once we were able to order it was such a smooth process! I was surprised and excited that they let us get the high rise crust with the free promotion! My pizza was sooo good and actually was the best Blaze pizza I've ever had. This location is going to be my go to it's very spacious inside with lots of seating--can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If Blaze was the last meal I could ever have that would be enough! I came on opening day and they were giving out free build your own pizzas all day AND WE EVEN GOT A COUPON FOR A FREE BOGO PIZZA! 

The staff members were super friendly and even bought out water cups to guests standing in line. They had conversations with what seemed like every person in line and made me feel so welcome! 

The pizza was amazing (per usual) but their blood orange lemonade taste like it came straight out of heaven!!! I can't wait to go back to this location since it's closer to where I live! 

P.S.-The BBQ drizzle at the end is life changing!!"}
{"text":"Always the best pizza place to go to. I'm so happy it's so close to me. I dream about eating Blaze everyday. So much better than any other byo pizza places.. they also do NOT skimp on any toppings. Yumyumyum. There aren't that many good pizza places in Summerlin. I'm just happy to be so close to something I can just go and know I'll never be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Blaze is located on Eastern ave and Horizon in Henderson. Its between the KFC and the CVS store. Blaze is actually located in the same location that Sweet Tomatoes To Go used to be. As soon as I walked in to Blaze I was given a warm friendly greeting by the staff, I was also given an explanation of how the build your own pizza style works. The build your own is $7.95 and the amount of toppings you can add on are unlimited. I used to go to a place on the strip that has this concept, it costs more and the toppings you can get are limited and certain toppings cost extra. I was pleased that the toppings were unlimited. The restaurant is spacious and clean. Blaze also has an outside patio that I will use in future visits once the weather cools down. I thought that the staff was attentive and the pizza was ready very fast, They also have a selection of salads and glutton free pizza for those that want glutton free pizza. Im so glad Blaze is close to where I live. I used to go to a strip casino for this type of Pizza, I wont name the place here, Blaze is the perfect alternative for us locals. I will return"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The crust was thin, but not too crispy! Super fresh veggies! Excellent customer service! I would definitely recommend this place! It's reasonably priced and they have a great variety of toppings! The gluten free crust was so good! I'll get that next time."}
{"text":"Great selection of toppings and the price point is awesome for the quality of ingredients. The pizza also comes out really quick once you choose all of your toppings and the staff (yes there was a lot of people working at one time) were all very nice. I will definitely be back again and this time stick around to eat instead of getting my pizza to go."}
{"text":"I've never been asked so many times at a restaurant how my day was going. I know this is their first day open but they are super friendly here and I hope they keep up the excellent customer service. I already like this location better than the other one in town. My pizza was delicious even though they apologized for it not being a perfect circle :)"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place the other night. I really enjoy the concept and ability to make your own or pick from their menu. I had the meat lovers which was delicious, I added fresh basil and oregano to it as well as plenty of parm ;) my friend ordered the Art Lovers and thoroughly enjoyed that as well. Only reason I'm not giving five stars is that the folks making the pizzas were too busy talking to eachother instead of taking care of customers."}
{"text":"Came here for their opening Free pizza night...got a build your own free pizza and loaded on the ingredients.

Pros
-The workers were friendly and fast
-The pizza was very good, with good crust and fresh ingredients

Cons
-I would say not enough cheese (but it's the most expensive ingredient to want a lot of and for free pizza day, hard to expect more).

Of all the make your own pizza chains popping up in the high degree oven pizza craze, this has been the best I've tasted so far. I was impressed."}
{"text":"Hand down, my favourite pizza place. I wish there was one in Markham :( but whenever I go downtown (which isn't often, you can find me here).

I was build my own pizza because you can get unlimited toppings. Its like a subway for pizza.

Its $12.85 + tax to build your own. I also love that they have an app so you can collect \"flames\" to earn free rewards. 

I always get the pesto sauce with all the meats, mushrooms, garlic, onions, etc. Its absolutely amazing.

The staff here are also very friendly and generous. 

Its cool because they cook your pizza on the spot for you and it takes about 5 minutes or less. The pizza comes out extremely hot and fresh, and its to die for!!!!
 
You won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"Awesome concept. You can choose as many toppings as you want for free and there are so many to choose from! The pizza is ready within minutes due to the accelerated baking method they use. The staff is awesome and the location/setting is great. However, the pizza itself is just ok. It's just average tasting in terms of crust, sauce and toppings and that's what counts the most, right?"}
{"text":"This place is great! The ingredients are super fresh, the service is quick, and the staff is awesome. Everyone is so willing to help and offer suggestions. Blaze is my new go-to spot when I need a pizza fix."}
{"text":"This is good pizza and it comes out pretty fast, though they have no chicken wings and lack good dessert. If they had all that, I would've given this a higher rating!"}
{"text":"Best pizza place in town. At the price with the amount of unlimited gourmet style toppings I was surprised how incredibly tasty it was. No more pizza pizza or other fast food pizza places for me!! I'm definitely coming back for this one!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The pizzas are very good and the pricing is right! Our family can go there to eat and get the toppings that we each like without putting us in the poorhouse. I love that they have roasted garlic as an option for a topping. I also love that it's really quick so my kids don't get antsy waiting for the food :)"}
{"text":"I originally tried blaze pizza in California and I was excited to know we had some in Vegas. I absolutely love this place. Pizza is to your liking with whatever ingredients you want and the Ceasers salad is so good. Staff always friendly."}
{"text":"I'd give this place five stars for the food, the service, and the price. For my husband and I, it was $19 for two \"build your own\" pizzas and one drink. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and helped by a very pleasant employee which set a very good tone for our experience. We went down the line and I was pleasantly surprised that there were so many topping options. It's unlike any pizza place I've been to and on top of that, the pizza itself was fantastic. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"So good. And affordable. My eight-year-old says he only ever wants to eat pizza here."}
{"text":"I finally got around to stopping by this spot for a quick late lunch. It wasn't as busy as it usually seems to be when I'm in that shopping center. The staff could've been a little more attentive especially since there was so many of them and I was the only customer at the time. They were discussing their personal lives while I was trying to order and I had questions regarding their menu. They didn't seem to really be helpful so I winged it with my choices and 2/3 were good enough! 

Regardless, the food was great! I definitely won't get white one again though. It throw my taste buds off. The combination of the greens and garlic and white sauce did and chicken bites weren't up to the other pizzas we got. Usually, I'm a fan of white sauce, too. The veggies and BBQ chicken were winning in my book! They over did  the veg pizza and the whole crust and bottom weren't burnt. I'll definitely check my order before I leave next time.  

Overall, if your looking to spend around 8 bucks on a quick personalized 6 slice pizza on the northwest side of town this may be your new spot. The dine in sitting was next and spacious as well. With some better service this could be easy 4-5 star rating joint!"}
{"text":"I have been there about four or five times, and EVERY time I go there the employees are genuinely nice and kind to me. They make me feel special w/out going over board. GREAT TASTING!!! Tastes very authentic as they use outstanding ingredients. Highly recommend this place to others!!"}
{"text":"I know where I'm getting my pizza from now on! Blaze is amazing!
The crust is thin and crispy and made fresh and the choice of toppings is ample (I do wish they had sun dried tomatoes and hubby would like salami). The pizza is ready in 180 seconds.

It's done assembly line style, you pick your cheese(s), meats, veggies and they build the pie and then to the oven it goes.  One of the things I like is that you should never have a messed up pizza since you are watching it down the line being made. And for $10.45 you can get every topping they have on your pizza- what a bargain!

They also have an amazing blood orange lemonade that I drank 3 glasses of. 

I'm so happy that the NE finally got a decent gourmet style pizza place. I hope more NEW and INTERESTING restaurants make their way to this quadrant of the city."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time my custom pizza is delicious, great ingredients and so fast! (In my opinion superior to similar establishments) It's a great quick bite for lunch , and just flat out delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight for a special Yelp Elite party and it was great!  Raquel made us feel so at home.  She is awesome, friendly, hard working, and just great. (THANK YOU RAQUEL) She helped us with seating and got us anything we needed.  I am so glad I got to try the pizza here.  The spicy red sauce is to die for! You can add ANYTHING you want and everything is delicious.  Must try the blood orange lemonade and the s'mores dessert.  I can not wait to come back here and bring more friends & family. Amazingly friendly & dedicated staff too!!!"}
{"text":"I've had blaze all over the country but this one is where I had my best experience! They were really cool about me using a coupon here and made sure my pizza was made just perfect. 

At other Blaze stores (the Phoenix one) they always rush and seem to burn my pizza but here you can tell the customer is the top priority!"}
{"text":"Yay for PEEKSKA! And GF crust w/ vegan cheese and sauce option! Like the reviews before me, it is the Chipotle of the pizza world. Build your own or pick from a menu. John has tried a variety of their pizzas and also has done BYO. T always builds his own with GF crust and vegan cheese. The crust is so crispy! He likes that. We frequent this spot at least once a month or every other. It's a good spot to refuel after playing hard at the Aliante Nature Discovery park.

Don't forget to try their different lemonades! Prickly Pear FTW."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about how great Blaze Pizza is, so my expectations were EXTREMELY high. Honestly, it tastes good but it's not memorable. I've had just as good pizzas at other stores too. Maybe it's because I didn't get the $13 unlimited toppings pizza (REGRETS!!)..."}
{"text":"Had a friend get take out, was pretty good actually. Tasted like they used fresh ingredients and the bake was perfect. Crust was not too thin in the middle like most \"90 second\" pizzas. Will definitely try again."}
{"text":"Pizza is great! The sea salt and oregano are a great touch! Personal size pizzas for a decent price! You walk through a line and tell them what you want on the pizza and pizza is kept track of with customer!"}
{"text":"First visit - when you walk it looks like chipotle, but it's pizza. You can make your own pizza, or order one of Blazes signature. We both order a signature and it was awesome! Just enough food to fill you up but not to much to make you stuffed. The staff  was amazing, friendly, and gave better service than most sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is always delicous but unfortunately i have to give 3 stars because i encountered a female employee of yours that was beyond rude. A heavier set hispanic woman in her late 20s early 30s that worked behind the counter not only glared at me while i tried smiling at her but watched over my entire order while smirking. She wasn't the one making my pizza but she felt the need to make me feel uncomfortable and honestly angry. Please correct this issue and her attitude"}
{"text":"$11 for all-you-can-put toppings on your pizza yaaaas. Love their concept. 

A popular place to grab pizza to go around ryerson. Being selfish me, I wanted to put everything on my pizza which got kind of messy later when the toppings dont stick as well. However, they do have pre-combination pizzas for $9. Time wise, took about 5 mins from ordering to getting out due to the line. However, service is really friendly! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I liked it ok . I asked if I could get salad on it and that was more money and they said they would do it this time but not the next time.
I like the one in downtown Summerlin better.
It's close to my house. I wouldn't say it's awesome or anything."}
{"text":"Since moving here, Blaze has been one of our favorite discoveries. The whole family can enjoy pizza just the way they want it! The service has always been fast and friendly. The pizza is great too. We have made our own combos and used some of their suggestions. Yum! My only wish is that they'd redesign the drink station area. It's super crowded. But I can say that their freshly brewed tea is great. We tried the s'mores cookie once and didn't feel it was with the extra money and calories.  I highly recommend the environment and their pizza. Glad to become a regular here!"}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza. This is my first time to one of the new counter walk up make your own pizza shops. We were greeted by counter staff as we entered and studied the menu for our order. I went simple with Pepperoni and cheese. (lots of cheese) Josie had a Mushroom Artichoke Olive Pizza with garlic pesto sauce. Mine was traditional. We added two drinks bring total just over twenty dollars for the meal. I can't say that the pizza had a wow factor accept it was fired and served pretty quick. The Garlic pesto sauce had Garlic. I like that when you are ready to leave they have to go boxes that are not full on pizza boxes. Just the right size to not take up half your shelf space in your home fridge. 
Thanks for dining at Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza. I may try it again. I want to try Pizza Rev across street and compare. It's a good quick stop away from the Mall traffic at Galleria if you are out shopping."}
{"text":"We came here at about 6:00pm and it was a circus.... None of the employees were over the age of 18.

There was no structure or method to the madness. Extremely inefficient with no supervision.

They ran out of dough a few times while we were standing in line. The kitchen was a mess with ingredients and sauce everywhere.

I'm pretty positive they have not cleaned the oven in a long time. It is covered in black burnt crust and you can be sure that the bottom of your pizza will be burnt and black.

Pass."}
{"text":"I walked in and liked the decor. There are plenty of tables and it has a trendy kind of look. I was greeted by multiple employees and they were very well staffed. You can either get one of the signature pizzas which come with predetermined toppings or you can make your own. I chose to make my own and went down line choosing any of the multitude of ingredients they had to offer. It's like a Subway type of line except for pizza instead of sandwiches. It was cooked quickly but was fully cooked partially due to the thin crust. The pizza was flavorful and delicious and made my way. The price is great too for the amount of food you get. I will be back again."}
{"text":"My family loves going here for our individual pizzas that are made in right in front of you! And their Smores are delicious, they bake them in the wood stove oven while you eat so it's nice and warm when you are ready for desert!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza for an awesome price. The workers are also incredibly friendly, shout out Sam and Calvin. Thank you and keep doing what you do!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and got the white top pizza. I subbed their garlic pesto sauce for the cream sauce but it was not very flavorful at all.  Did not taste like garlic or pesto. 

The crust was probably the best part as all the toppings were average. 

I also got the smores pie for dessert. Big mistake! This was the most vile smores thing I have ever tasted. The supposed graham cracker tasted like cardboard, the marshmallow tasted like pure chemical and I'm not convinced it was actual chocolate on it. 

Overall a very disappointing experience as the place looked like it had promise."}
{"text":"Really love the concept of this place. I can be in and out in around 5 minutes if its not busy (which isn't all too often). The crust is crispy and there are lots of great variety of fresh toppings. For 7.95 you can make whatever kind of pizza you want. They also have really great lemonade. Sometimes when they make the pizza they can get a little sloppy, but that would be my only complaint. Overall though, lot of love for the fast fired pizza. 4.5/5"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times in North Las Vegas, and up until today the service and the pizza has been amazing. Today, I would classify, as one of the worst experiences I've ever had regarding customer service. I'll further expand on this by saying that Jared (or Gerald), who is the General Manager is by far the most unprofessional manager I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Based on his attitude and behavior, I'd say that the mantras of your Management Training Program are \"The Customer Is ALWAYS Wrong\",  and \"The Only Way To Hold A Conversation Is Through Being Argumentative and Impossible\".
Here's the gist:
I placed an online order tonight. It's the first time I've ever used your app to order (I've got some feedback on the app if you would like to hear it sometime). I was actually happy to see that when I placed my order, the app stated that my pizza would be prepared, but wouldn't be fired until I checked in with the cashier. I thought this was a great touch, cause my pizza would be piping hot when I got it!! I ordered three Build your owns. The only special instructions I had on one of the pizzas was that I wanted pesto on the crust. Yum! I selected that I would be at the restaurant at 8:15. Sadly, I didn't get there until 8:21. 
When I walked in, I went to the cashier, and signed my receipt. I hung out, and waited for my pizzas to come out of the oven. After a few short moments, one of the guys working the station where the pizzas get cut and boxed, turned around and grabbed three pizza boxes from the top of the oven. The other gentleman called my name and handed me the boxes. I'm my past experiences, the person opens the boxes and shows you the pizzas. I've always thought this was a nice touch because it gives you a chance to chance to check your order. This didn't happen. I stopped at a table and checked my order. Two of the three pizzas were supposed to be finished with BBQ Sauce. Sadly, they weren't. I headed back to the counter and the gentleman fixed the discrepancy. 
As I grabbed the boxes, I found it odd that the pizzas had been pulled from the top of the oven, and they felt lukewarm, not hot. 
Unfortunately, I had other food in the car, and a diabetic girlfriend at home that had already taken her insulin shot and had to eat soon, so I wasn't able to do much about it.
I drove home, which is literally 5 minutes away (Though my maps app says 7...guess I'm a little heavy on the gas!). When I got into the house my suspicions were confirmed. The pizzas were not hot. They were actually to the point where the ovalini mozzarella on two of the pizzas was thick and stiff. It was a letdown. So I decided to call the store and ask why my pizzas were fired before I checked in. After about 5 or so minutes, I was able to speak to Jared (or Gerald). The very first thing I asked him was if the app says to check in so your pizzas would get fired, the. Why were mine cooked and sitting on top of the oven. This was where things quickly went downhill. The first thing he said is \"If your pizzas weren't ready when you walked in the door, then you'd be complaining about that too\". I was really caught off guard by that comment. I told him I didn't Ming waiting the four or five minutes it takes to cook the pizza to get it fresh. He then said \"Your order said ASAP on it, so you indicated that you wanted them right away when you ordered them\". I told him that I did no such thing. He then said \"All I can tell you is that you need to pay more attention when you're ordering your pizzas to make sure you don't put ASAP in the special instructions\". I again told him I didn't do that. I told him that the only special instructions were that on one of the pizzas I asked for pesto on the crust. He then said \"Well someone at some point put in your order that you wanted them ASAP\". I told him again, that I never used the app before, so that wasn't possible. His tone and demeanor continued to decline and it got to the point where I couldn't even talk. He kept cutting me off and accusing me of some wrongdoing. Eventually, I just asked for a District Managers Name / Phone Number. He then told me I could file a complaint on the companies website. He also made it clear that I needed to make sure that you knew the ticket said ASAP, as if to continue to imply that I was in the wrong. 
I was beyond furious at this point, for several reasons.
Needless to say, I have contacted the company via email & Twitter. I can only hope that they do something with the Manager at this location."}
{"text":"This is a newer nice and clean location. The food was prepared by friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday 08/09 a little later in the afternoon on a whim. Never heard of this place, yelp'ed it and found it had only been open for a few days.  We weren't let down one bit by our last minute pick. We each got a custom pizza, drinks, and I had a smores dessert for about $20. The pizza was delicious! Love thin crust. It did well heated up today which is also a plus. Staff is a little overwhelming in numbers- but this will probably come in handy when it gets busier. Overall, quick and great service, cheap eats that didnt taste cheap at all.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I  did go back. I figured that since the owner cared enough to reply to my review, I should try it one more time (did not use the coupon offered). The first pizza was great (thin pizza) the second wasn't. Here is my conclusion: get to the place when it's calm (avoid rush hours) ; don't order the thick crust, they don't know how to cook it-it gets burned or raw--

My suggestion: take the thick crust out of the menu (I was the only one ordering it anyway. From all the times I've been in this place, only once I saw anyone ordering the thick crust.

Have your employees use a measurement. Depending on who you get, you may receive 4 leaves of spinach or 12 (spinash should be placed under the sauce to avoid burning).

When choosing white sauce, understand that you will receive one tablesspoon of it and it will burn...so, don't choose white sauce. When they do burn your pizza (if you choose the thick crust, they have never burned the thin ones) make sure to cancel otherwise you pay for 4 topings and get one, still burned.

So, the conclusion is this: off the rush hour you can get a very good think pizza, sometimes even excellent. The problem is with the thick crust and the rush hours. The fact that the place is inconsistent makes for difficult choice even though I did get an excellent pizza this time."}
{"text":"The concept is good but the consistancy is just not there at this location.  Your pizza will only be as good as the 10 teenagers that are there.  They take no care when applying the toppings and none of them make any attempt to evenly distribute them.  Sometimes the pizza will be ok but sometimes it will end up like a piece of charcoal and completely inedible. This location is always packed and full of loud annoying kids whos parents stare obliviously into the void as they misbehave."}
{"text":"Great Pizza...And that s'mores cookie was even better!  The food quality is excellent, you can get any toppings you dream of on a pizza.  The spicy red sauce is perfection and so is the crust.  You must definitely top your visit off with that s'mores cookie all warmed up.  

Would have gave it 5 stars but the staff wasn't as friendly at the register, and I had to repeat my toppings over and over to one of the guys because I did not have his undivided attention.  Other than that, we will be back for another try."}
{"text":"Amazing the entire staff was super friendly and attentive. Big thumbs up on the service and food. Quick and good price also. Coming back."}
{"text":"I got takeout from this place. It was great! They have options for speciality pizzas or you can make your own. They had great options for toppings. My pizza was perfectly cooked and delish. They're more of a personal sized pizza. I also got a salad. It was delish!! It had fruit and a great dressing on it. I'd definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Came in on national pi day, and let me tell you the 2hr wait was well worth it.. After finally getting to the front of the line to order, we were greeted by Xavier and he had nothing but smiles and a great attitude.. I ordered the build your own, and loaded it with meat, (pepperoni, bacon, sausage) all of which was delicious! I then added a sea salted chocolate chip cookie, and goodness those things are awesome after being warmed up!  You also have to try the lemonades, they're so refreshing.. while sitting we had, eddy, Chris, and mike all come ask if we were doing okay, even with how busy they were they still had time to make sure we were doing alright.. we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The good: Build your own pizza...do it because you get to load all the toppings you want! I piled mine up sky high and, it tasted amazing. The prices and portion size are well worth it. The staff are very friendly and it's like an assembly line when you order but they are so on top of things, they can't get your order wrong. 

I loved this place! 

The bad: Nothing."}
{"text":"It's basically Subway for pizza, and you should expect the same quality. 

Most of the employees were friendly, but when trying to make one guy laugh, he just looked at me with a scowl. The pizza is average at best. It's the fresh toppings that hide the lack of taste. I also ordered a Caesar salad but took it off the order once I saw it was boxed. The s'more was decent but nothing memorable. 

If you're into the hip vibe above taste, then go for it. If you're into quality pizza above style, then you might want to skip it."}
{"text":"One word, three syllabuls... A-MA-ZING! I've eaten here twice over the last month and this place is truly amazing! The customer service and wood fired pizzas are excellent. This place is always clean and the staff is always super courteous and friendly. But lets talk about the plethora of amazing toppings to choose from for your custom pizza! I keep telling myself to try something different, but I keep reverting back to my favorite which consists of: garlic pesto sauce with a drizzle of spicy red pepper sauce, feta and mozzarella cheese, spinach, chicken, turkey meatballs, zucchini, roasted red peppers and finished with a pesto drizzle! This is hands down the best pizza in the city! I also love how they are extremely cautious with someone that has a gluten free allergy! Blaze's staff goes to great lengths to ensure that they protect the surface and utensils used to create a gluten free pizza and I've never seen any other establishment handle a gluten free allergy to this magnitude. Oh, and get the blood orange punch to drink, its amazing! Check out Blaze, you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"So completely worth it. It's affordable, super filling, and you get to customize your own pizza with as MANY toppings as you want?!? YAY! 

I've been to Blaze in Edmonton and I found that they skimped out on the toppings (you had to constantly ask them to add a little more), but they are much more generous here. The crust is surprisingly delicious and very thin, the choice of toppings were decent, but there are not as much choices as (for example...in Edmonton again) Love Pizza (which gives you choices such as honey, prosciutto, pesto chicken, sweet base sauces, etc). 

What I did like about Blaze in Toronto was the service. They are so nice here! A few of the servers came by to check and see if we were satisfied, and they were constantly clearing and cleaning tables -- and really, they don't need to do any of this. 

I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"[fire emoji] [fire emoji] [fire emoji]

Let's just be honest, let's just be real. I would like to thank Lebron for leading me to this brand! The place is a real treat - fresh ingredients (laid out like a salad bar and explained as you make a pizza), excellent staff and customer service, and a delicious product. The pizza is reasonably well priced and is ready to eat in minutes. 

I had the red vine pizza because it seems like the best item to test the core product, that is, the crust and sauce. I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised - the crust is more towards the crispier side than spongy (I prefer greasy and spongy but this is a healthy product), it certainly tastes good, and there wasn't an overbearing aftertaste. The tomato sauce actually tastes like tomatoes and doesn't have that metallic flavour that some other places might have. 

The other thing about this place is that their attitude towards health - ingredients seem wholesome (ex. they highlight their gluten-free crust) and calories are listed (not terrible amounts considering it's pizza).I saw a lot of runners stop by for a quick bite to go. 

All in all, a great experience and I will be coming back to try the unlimited toppings next time! 

Side note: s'more sandwiches were eh."}
{"text":"BEST pizza joint EVER! The food is great and the employees are always very attentive and friendly!! I have been recommending that place to everyone! It's perfect for our family because we can all never agree on toppings so we all have our own pizzas exactly how we like them!"}
{"text":"What a great idea for a fast paced good food place. We got ours to go but you can dine in if you choose. The pizza was delicious and fresh the staff was friendly and helpful. In and out of the place in less than 15 minutes and they were busy!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and the dough is chewy. They just seemed to be a complete mess with their process. They had a special, but we wish we would have just gone to our favorite, Za Blong."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places in town for pizza. It's a great atmosphere, fun workers, and good food. When I went, there was a young gentleman named Nate that really enhanced my experience. He was a good worker that made me feel welcomed and I had a good conversation with him. Will definitely be back here soon largely because of my good experience."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, delicious pizza.

This isn't the best pizza in town but it is cheap (about $8 for an 11 inch pizza), and was surprisingly tasty.

Definitely order online or call as the line was quite long to order."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit tonight.  We were shown lots of hospitality and the location looked great. 

I had the meat eater pizza. It comes with pepperoni, meatballs, red onions, mozzarella, and red sauce. It was delicious. I'm usually not a fan of a thin crust but this was good. It was crispy but not hard. 

I tried the blood orange lemonade. It was nice and sweet. This will be my drink of choice when i return.

I will definitely add Blaze to my list of go to places in the university area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, delicious pizza, thin crust and fast service!  We came here with friends and kids & the kids loved the variety of toppings where they can create their own pizzas.  Definitely will come back again!  My favourite would have to be the meat lovers pizza.  You get to put condiments on the pizza as well: cheese, chillies flakes, oregano etc...thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Everyone on staff around 6-7pm on jan 12 were amazing! They all had smiles on their faces and were helpful during our first visit! Thank you thank you thank you for the vegan cheese and gluten free options! I just moved in near by so will be coming back often for pizza :) so yummy!


Update:
I came back again because my last visit was awesome! Tonight Katelyn, Louis, Jade, Teresa, and Cheyenne were all on deck. I was super happy after Katelyn helped us. She is an awesome girl and deserves a raise of pay or promotion! Louis and Teresa also were awesome, great staff. Thank you also Jade for your sweet smile. Make more room in the tip jar."}
{"text":"The pizza was awesome, although the person made a mistake on the toppings...KB fixed everything and gave me a free pizza coupon for the mistake. Good food, good service!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza, numerous options for toppings, and the fact that toppings are unlimited is a huge bonus.  The staff was extremely friendly and the service was excellent.  Even when it's really busy you get your pizza quickly... and they have beer, so that's a plus.  I would definitely recommend this place for a quick, inexpensive, and delicious lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. The customer service was exceptional.  Lots of choices to choose from plus a build your own. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I had my first in Orlando and pizza was amazing there. Although our pizzas WERENT as amazing here it's still good. I have to give it top ratings for fast and friendly service - wowsers! Wish all restaurants are like this. Cookies and desserts are too expensive and not worth it. Fun atmosphere right beside ryerson university. We will visit again."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty harsh critic when it comes to pizza places. I'm a pizza maker from New York, so my standards are pretty high. But with that said, Blaze does a great job! The pizza is perfect size for one, the staff is really nice and helpful, service is really fast, and the pizza is really good. They have really hit the nail on the head and have this pizza thing down!"}
{"text":"Another Subway-esque pizza place close to Mill! Oh joy!
I've driven by this Blaze many times but never thought about stopping by (since I tend to favor Fired Pie). I got a coupon/ad in the mail asking to stop by since they were new to the neighborhood. Happened that one night I was rediculously hungry and the only thing that could quench my hunger was pizza. So off to Blaze I went! 

It was a fairly quiet evening at Blaze so I had quick , painless service. I got my go-to pie- cheese, carmelized onions, sausage, and mushrooms to compare against the others. What differentiates their pizza from the others was minimal. I could tell the sauce was sweeter and the crust was... different, but other than that, it was the same. It's cool though they make their own house-flavor lemonades, I tried a few while waiting."}
{"text":"I came into blaze a while agoo and my experience was great. It wasnt to busy and I remember Craig the guy who put toppings on was so nice and funny and Corey the cook made me a really well made pizza in the oven. I totally recommend this place to anyone who wants pizza"}
{"text":"Friendly fast and darn good pizza with a tasty mango drink for $15.   Definitely on my list next time I crave pizza while in town in town."}
{"text":"This is the pizza place of my dreams. I was seriously in pizza heaven. I shared a build your own pizza with my bf and it was amazing! I can't wait to come back. I love how they are calorie conscious too!"}
{"text":"Most amazing vegan gluten free pizza I ever had!!!!!!! And the workers are so friendly! My go to for pizza(:"}
{"text":"Wow I love the consept build your own pizza, the sauces are great the price is right, and I love the atmosphere .  Great choice of salads, and they also have cold beer."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! They have such a wide variety of fresh options to put on your pizza!! They have some signature pizzas that you can purchase or you can build your own (for under $8) with UNLIMITED toppings!! Staff is very friendly and helpful and the restaurant is clean and well maintained! Will be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"Blaze pizza has the best vegan pies in my opinion. Their tofu popcorn chicken is on point! Seriously, for under $8 I can get a personal pizza loaded with unlimited veggies of my choosing. I'm talking bell peppers, mushrooms, basil, and zucchini with a spicy marinara base. I always order my pizza with daiya cheese, although most vegans aren't a fan of this brand. I think it tastes awesome! 

When you're in a hurry, I'd recommend ordering online. When your order is ready for pick-up, you just mosey over to the cashier and they'll fire up your pizza in the oven. Otherwise, waiting in line may take a sec because Blaze always has a crowd.

{"text":"Long line when you walk in but worth the wait when you get your custom made pizza to order, definitely coming back for more pizza!"}
{"text":"So I'm sure you've heard about this place. I mean, everyone is talking about it. And for good reason. We went with the create your own and they turned out awesome. It was an unbelievable value for the money. Service was great. Everyone was friendly and helpful. The pizza was fresh and crispy. We had a smores cookie that was heated and it was sooooooo good! We look forward to going again and trying different pizza combinations. I didn't try a salad but will next time. The only thing that was just ok to me was the sweet tea (tasted stale and old) but I just dumped it out and got something else. 

Great new addition to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great dough knots. I recommend the blood orange lemonade. You have to tell them not to burn your food. Although that's kind of the point with the wood fire I was seeing people with food so black you couldn't tell what it was. When I asked they did it right. I accidentally dropped my pizza and immediately they called out remake and gave me a new one although I did not ask and was willing to pay again. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I am giving it a 5 just because of the passion of the owners/managers and staff (4 for the food). I have never experienced such a happy and friendly staff. I love how everyone called you by name and we're just so happy to help you make the tough calls on what to add to your pizza. That really is the hardest part, too many wonderful choices, but I love you can do a half and halt so you can try more options. Salty, but that is too be expected with pizza. Although I will admit if you are salt sensitive like I am it is a little overwhelming, meaning you really taste the salt every bite you take.  I love pizza and this is probably not the best pizza I have every had (that was in in Italy), but for the concept and cost it really is a special treat.   A great lunch time spot. The s'more dessert so tasty. The restaurant is clean and set up well. Great location."}
{"text":"So good!! We got build your own. The pesto sauce was amazing. Service was very fast and they where all very nice. Can't go wrong here. Can't wait to come back and try a new combination."}
{"text":"There is something about wood fired pizza that I completely love. 
Being this was a \"fast food\" wood fired pizza, it filled my cravings. I actually could have had more. It is a little bit \"tucked away\" from a main drag, so it is a place you likely won't just happen upon. You have to seek it out. And that's too bad because it's a good place to eat. 

I had a hard time hearing what the girl behind the counter was saying and the menu wasn't entirely clear, so I just stuck with a signature pizza. And that was totally ok. I loved it. 

The place was clean, however when I went to go grab my drink, I noticed the staff didn't put out the parmsean, chili flakes and hot sauce on the tables. Yes, it was accessible, but you had to walk further walkway from your table, past the drink machines to add to your pizza. A little annoying but definitely not the end of the world. 

All in all, this place is a total recommend and I'll likely take my mom there next week. This place is a total recommend."}
{"text":"Place is on point. Kids love the smores. Wife loves the salad. I love the environment and how quick the food is made to your liking. Everyone must try this place !!!"}
{"text":"I really don't know what all the good reviews are for at this place... 

I came here for lunch with my coworkers during the summer. We were really excited about the unlimited toppings in making our pizza. I chose the spicy red sauce, chicken, bacon, mozzarella and some other unmemorable toppings. 

Meh. The pizza crust wasn't overly amazing. Maybe it was my choice of toppings, but I thought the pizza was pretty bland. The chicken was dry and tasteless. Their menu advertised a bunch of sauces, which I wanted, but there were no signs at the end of the BYOB station. Since we were being rushed through, I didn't have a chance to ask about them."}
{"text":"Blaze Fast-Fire'd Pizza has everything that I would look for in a great pizza place. Great choice of toppings, thin crust, stone-fire over and of bust of all a student-friendly priced menu. 

The menu has suggested pizza or make-your-own pizza. I suggest make your own because for the price of $10.75 you can get as many toppings as you want on it. I suggest make your own because for the price of $10.75 you can get to put as many toppings as you want on it. YES you heard right AS MANY AS YOU WANT. They have a great variety of sauces, cheeses, meats and fresh vegetables. After you have chosen all of that they place it in a stone-oven which to me is the only way to cook pizza. This whole process takes less than 5 minutes and what you get a delicious pizza made by you for you. 

This place is definitely going put a few pounds on the scale for me as the price, quality and taste is just blessed especially on a student budget. Bye Felicia to Pizza Pizza"}
{"text":"I did an online order so did not have an incredibly long wait, but even if I did it would be well worth it! Fresh ingredients, good red sauce, great crust and good vegan cheese!! When you have made to order pizzas like this, and people lined up to get them, there is bound to be a wait. Service was good, everyone working hard! Oh and two pizzas with vegan cheese....$17.00!! Can't find that at other near by pizza joints. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I really don't need to say anything about the food, it's fantastic. Always. Every time. I really wanted to say something about the customer experience. And so, I will!

A bit of background, if I may. I have worked in the customer service industry, on the Las Vegas Strip,  for the last ten years for a company who prides itself on top notch customer service and employee/customer interaction. This company, who shall remain nameless (but it rhymes with Beazers), hasn't the first clue on how to motivate employees to WANT to provide this level of service. That being said, I have no idea how Blaze does it, but every time I walk into this place (at least twice a week)  I feel like each and every employee there is happy to be there. Their smiles are genuine and even during the busiest of times, the great attitudes never fail. I've seen them cope with mistakes and miss-ordered food without a single slip in their service standards. I've never seen an unhappy customer there either, and that's saying something. I know that the bar is set pretty low for places like this, but they consistently achieve so much more than you'd expect that they're rapidly becoming my favorite place to eat.

So, in no specific order, let me thank the team who served my son and I last night:
Gina, Felix, Eduardo, Michael, Courtland, Angelo and Cesar thank you all very much!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time the other day! I love thin crust pizza so the crust they had was perfect! I like that you can make your own or choose one from the menu and add things to make it your own! Only complaint was that it was pretty bland. I usually don't eat that much salt but it's saying something when I had to add a few dashes of salt on my pizza!"}
{"text":"Good sauce! Love the Art Lover and Blood Orange Lemonade."}
{"text":"I've been to other Blaze locations and my experiences have been great. The staff at this location is fantastic. Great service.

I order pizzas online. I skip the line. Check-in with them so they can fire my pizzas = fresh, hot pizzas!

One thing I've noticed though is the amount of oil that's on my pizzas. Top and bottom are oily. This isn't the case at the other locations. I never ask for olive oil drizzle. So, why? 

Sure, it's better quality pizza than say Pizza Hut and all those places. The pizzas only come in one size. They have signature pizzas or you can build your own. You have a choice of crust: original or gluten-free. They have different sauces, cheeses, meats, veggies and finishes. They also have salads and a S'more pie for dessert.

My favorites are: Green Stripe or my own creation (white cream sauce + pesto, pepperoni, turkey meatballs, sausage, and ricotta)."}
{"text":"Just tried this place today for the 1st time... Not oly is the food delicious and made fast, but the people were VERY friendly... I was greeted the moment I walked walked in (and it was slam packed) everyone down the line was extremely nice, and the staff checked on me multiple times to make sure everything was good while I was eating... All in all it was an enjoyable experience. I would not only recommend, but will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place... The staff is extremely friendly, the facility is very clean and the food is delicious... If you are on the fence about trying new pizza, do yourself a favor and eat here... You won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience! Being that we have just begun our vegan journey. This was day 4 or 5 hard to remember being that all I had was meat on mind, but to my surprise blaze has a pretty vegan/vegetarian menu! My wife ordered me my own pie w vegan cheese and spinach, waaaay different from my usual pepperoni and oh so delicious dairy cheese Mmmm... anyway this was a first and I must say not so bad tasting experience. Around the 3 and 4th slice I could taste the difference which kinda threw me off a little but surprisingly satisfying. 
My wife ordered the veg out pie and the kids had the same as me w some squash, quinoa and Caesar salad. My wife did not like the squash salad but the kids enjoyed there pizza and polished off there salad, over all the experience was really nice! We felt excepted with such an extreme diet knowing that restaurants are catering to us keep up the great work blaze!"}
{"text":"Never before have I experienced such a customizable pizza place, and I love it!  I especially appreciate the vegan cheese options, as well as the awesome selection of toppings.  So much fun, and so much deliciousness.  Can't wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"While stuffing my face with a sandwich from CM in my car outside of First Wind before I went in for the Yelp Fit Club event there, a gentlemen from Blaze came up and knocked on my window (eek) asked me if I liked pizza (Duh.) and informed me of their opening and a free pizza promotion they had going on Friday. Who can say no to free pizza?! Even when you do have a mouth full of sandwich...

So Friday rolls around and I make my way over, wait in the line to get in the door (but it did move pretty fast) and approached the counter to build my own FREE pizza. Being the food jerk that I am, not being able to settle on just one thing, I made my pizza a half n half. No problem they said. Half classic sauce, ovalini mozzarella, ricotta, mushrooms, zucchini, roasted garlic, cherry tomatoes with a sprinkle of sea salt, the other half pesto sauce, mozzarella, feta, grilled chicken, bacon, red onion and spinach. Once outta the oven, all topped with arugula. In a mere 3 minutes they call your name hand you your pie...time to enjoy. 

So, how was it you might be wondering. As long as you aren't expecting NY or Chicago level greatness here you will be delighted for sure. The array of toppings could make endless wonderful combinations. The crust was better tasting than I expected, crisp and chewy with great flavor. Out of the two halfs I chose, the chicken bacon one was the winner. The fast cooking time didn't seem to give the ovalini mozzarella enough time to melt all the way nor enough time to fully cook the mushrooms ( I'm not a lover of raw mushrooms). Also that side came out a bit wet...perhaps water from the zucchini. Trial and error. Don't get me wrong though, still delicious and the sea salt sprinkle was the perfect touch. The other half was oh so good, modeled after a pizza I used to splurge on all the time when I used to live in raleigh. Getting it at Blaze proved way cheaper and dare I say, even more delicious.

The size was great. I was full after eating 4 of the 6 slices, excited to have some for later. People that worked there were super nice and thanked me from coming by and trying them out. Wait, this seems all wrong...they are thanking me...for giving me a free pizza?! Seems a bit twisted.

Thank you fella on Wednesday that told me about the free pizza day. Thank you Blaze for the delicious free pizza and kind service. I will be back to experiment/ eat more in the future. FYI On any normal, non-free pizza day they are still a great deal. $7.85 for infinite toppings. $6.50 for one topping $5 for a plain cheese."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it's close by but there's been some consistency issues.

My first couple times here about a year ago, I purchased a Custom-Pizza. I dined in, found a hair lol. I told one of the employees and I was given 4 coupons - 2 free pizzas, then two buy one get one free.

2 days ago, on my 3rd coupon, I bought two Custom-Pizzas to go. I ate a couple slices at home, there was a hair in my mouth later. I figured maybe I'm at home, it happens, I'll give this place benefit of the doubt.

Tonight, I found a hair laying on my pizza about an inch long. Lol, yup no more Blazed Pizza for me.

Lastly, the worker who made my pizza had gloves on covered in pesto oil.. Is the same person to check me out - long story short, my card was covered in oil afterwards."}
{"text":"Blaze is another place that does the Subway/Chipotle assembly line style pizza. If you've been to a Fired Pie, it's very similar (no idea who came first). I tried a normal pepperoni pizza and it was decent. Not really particularly good or bad. I was lucky I got there just before the lunch rush as the place filled up fast. All of the employees I interacted with were very pleasant and helpful. I will say their blood orange lemonade is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"We are vacationing here from the East Coast and boy do I wish they had these out near us!  We had such a wonderful experience!  First off, my son has a severe peanut and tree nut food allergy and it makes it a little more difficult to just eat whatever we want when dining out.  I looked on their website and they had an allergen menu and then I called ahead of time and they were able to answer all my questions regarding ingredients.   So thankful!

It is like a build your own pizza type deal...similar a to Subway and Chipotle set up.  They have popular pizzas that you can simply order and they put on all the toppings but then you can add or take away as many toppings as you want.  It was awesome!   They had so many choices of topping and it was so fun to be able to put exactly what you wanted and however much you want!  My husband and I split a pizza and we were able to customize each half the way we wanted.

Pizza was done surprisingly quick and it was so delicious. They cook it in a brick fire oven.  They have good fountain sodas to choose from and some interesting lemonades too!"}
{"text":"Blaze?? Um, yes please! It's all been said already, but I have to rave about this place. It's fast food pizza that's actually incredible. You create your own pizza with unlimited (yes, UNLIMITED) toppings and it's cooked in 180 seconds. The prices are reasonable. Great environment and the staff is beyond friendly and helpful. Even during lunch hour on a weekday, the staff was on it with clearing out and cleaning tables. I loved the pizza and the smores pie. Will be back for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"Maybe there are some kinks to work out but it took forever to move through their pizza assembly line. I asked for a little bit of sea salt and some bites were covered in it. My pizza was burnt and I just flat out didn't enjoy it. The price, 5.95 for the simple pie, is decent but I won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"I love love this place so yummy and afordable! The white sauce and regular red sauce r so good. The spicey red is good too I jus prefer the other two."}
{"text":"Atmosphere 4, lively hip quick, service 4.5, pizza a 5, no kidding great. Price ok, average Over all a 4.5 but for Yelp I will round up"}
{"text":"Top notch pizza, which you can customize with tons of topping choices! Not always the best service depending on who you get, but fresh ingredients and delicious pizza everytime."}
{"text":"Great concept! You can have amazing healthy or light side pizza quickly! Love it! Love than you can customize your own. The crust is light and thin!  Absolutely better than ordering some fatty overly processed pizza from those giant pizza chains! Also they put cheese on top instead of bottom and it holds ingredients on your pizza.  Love me some pizza pie!"}
{"text":"This is the way to order pizza. Get a crust, get a sauce, pick a few cheeses and meats, top it with the veggies of your choice and in a couple minutes you have a custom thin crust pizza to match your unique personality. But really though...I love this pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is always awesome and the service is the best always friendly. As many toppings as you want for one price and they never judge when you keep piling them on."}
{"text":"Writing this review on National Pi Day seems pretty appropriate. It's long overdue too since Blaze has become one of our favorite pizza places! I love personal pizzas since I can put all my favorite toppings on there without anyone saying anything (No meat please!!). There is so much variety in their toppings too. I always pile on as many veggies as possible. Everything is so fresh especially since they bake it right in front of you. You can even choose your type of crust, cheese, and sauce. The possibilities are truly endless.

Hubby and I usually dine-in, but this Henderson location is close to home so it stays warm if we decide to do take-out. We're currently waiting in a long line for $3.14 pies, but I know their pizza is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today to grab a quick bite. We figured anywhere we went next to the mall would be busy since its was a Sunday and everyone is doing their back to school shopping... When we walked in there was only 2 other tables occupied! Score!! We ordered and the pizzas were amazing! The guys at the counter taking the orders were great. It was my first time going and will not be my last. I hope the Eastern location is just as good!"}
{"text":"I love Blaze Pizza so much-- I love going here so I can get my own gluten free vegan cheese pizza. I also love that they have vegan chicken that I can add for a meat. It would be awesome if they would get vegan sausage or pepperoni one day. They have really fresh toppings, pretty much anything you can think of. 

It only takes a few minutes to cook the pizza. They also have alcohol here and my favorite Passion Fruit Fresca (Seriously Yummy).

The only thing I did not like here is the salads. Tried one the first time and it was pretty bad. Every other time I have gone in, the salads look horrible ( I mean I am talking brown in color). Maybe it's just too hot for the salads right there by the ovens. 

Also use the app to earn free pizza. But make sure you check it before you leave, the internet is really bad in the building for some reason and the app doesn't work all of the time."}
{"text":"Tasty, thin crust pizza, with fresh, interesting toppings at a reasonable price.  The spicy red sauce had an amazing kick to it.  Missed having a beer with my pizza - no alcohol options.  Inside is clean and modern, with help-yourself to go boxes.  Very kid friendly.  Will be back with the family."}
{"text":"Fast & friendly/ took the fam here for build your own pizza . Kids got creative. Veggies were fresh ! Will definitely come back ."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop in for quick pizza. The staff was very friendly and proud to spread the knowledge of their franchising business. You watch them make your pizza right in front of you and you can add all the fixings you would like. 

My hubby went plain Jane with his pizza and ordered a basic pepperoni pizza. He thought it was good, but will venture out with one of the signature pizzas next time. I ordered one of their signature pizzas called the Art Lover. The Art Lover came with artichokes, mozzarella, ricotta, garlic and red sauce. I also added spinach, black olives and oregano to my personal pizza. I really enjoyed it and was super filling. I also loved the Strawberry Aqua Fresca mixed beverage option. 

I will for sure be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place has it down. .. the crunch on the crust is out of this world.  That alone is worth the visit but their sauces and toppings are all top notch!  Be it red, white or their spicy sauce,  they are all very yummy and flavorful. The toppings... where to start,  they are all amazing.   Fresh,  flavourful and compliments the pies.    Service is always friendly and makes you feel like a regular.  Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! I would recommend this restaurant for the fast service, friendly staff and delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza that didn't make me prefer eating the box. Best thing I can say is I will eat there again. Would be five stars, but $4 for a fountain drink?"}
{"text":"First time in this joint. The pizzas are all thin crust. As a former pizza restaurant owner I can tell you they are not serving home made dough, its obviously frozen templates. Pizza is no where near good east coast pizzaria style.

Its a flat $8 for a personal pie including toppings and they have a ton of fresh toppings. You cant beat the price.

Pies are just the right size... you are not hungry or stuffed when you leave. 

Fun atmosphere too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place...The staff is friendly&This is the perfect place to come get a good pizza for a low price...And omg unlimited toppings...no extra charge!!!!Me&my daughters will be back real soon."}
{"text":"Pretty reasonable price for what you're getting since you can add as many toppings as you like. I went here during pi day where all pies were 3.14, I enjoyed eating it. I have came back a few times after that, I recommend it! I also like their lemonades."}
{"text":"Listen. I'm gonna have a problem having this place around. Excellent pizza done quick, quality and plentiful toppings, delightful beverages, depending on your personal budget a reasonable place for the occasional lunch or affordable \"special meal out\".

My mother and I got 1 build your own pizza and 2 drinks. Our toppings were goat cheese gorgonzola and shredded mozzarella as our cheeses, roasted garlic and onions on the whole thing, and pepperoni, fresh spinach, and Kalamata olives on my half. I was very impressed by how fresh all the ingredients looked, and how tasty the regular red sauce and dough were. Ours was cooked to perfection as were all the ones ahead of ours. Drinks offered were the standard coke fountain but there was also lemonade and blood orange lemonade. My mom adored the blood orange one, and I also liked it though not a lemonade fan. 

So the pizza and the two refillable drinks came to just under $17, and while we both wanted more we weren't left hungry. 

The one thing I'd say could be improved is the way the garlic is roasted. .. I wish it was either roasted longer at a lower temperature or that it had been sliced up at the level of roast that had been achieved."}
{"text":"Blaze Pizza is not your typical pizza ordering experience. Conveniently located at 10 Dundas East, this joint is capable of catering to just about any gathering. Their 11 inch pizza is priced right at just about $10 and can be ready in as quickly as 180 seconds. It makes for a perfect lunch meal, especially for students, groups, or those shopping and working nearby.

The flow of placing and paying for your order is very streamlined and organized, as is the choosing of your toppings. Staff are quite friendly and work in an assembly line in a quick, coordinated manner. There are 40 toppings to choose from which means you'll never get bored of coming here.

Must-try items:
Any custom pizza
Lemonade

All of the toppings taste really fresh and of good quality. Try mixing up various sauces and cheeses, then sprinkle on your favourite meats or keep it veggie. The choice is really yours. 

All of the seating is well thought out and the place is nicely decorated. The unanimous consensus seems to be that Blaze is one of the top notch pizza joints in the downtown core."}
{"text":"This was MUCH better than my last experience.  Last time they messed up my roomies pizza so mine was warm, and had no caesar salads...just the ones with chicken.  The people that work there make the experience, and are very attentive to your needs.  The are constantly cleaning up, and doing whatever they can to make it a good experience.  It's half the price of Grimaldi's which is AWESOME!  They just never make it crispy like they do, otherwise, I would have given today's visit 5 stars!"}
{"text":"When I walked in I was surprised at how packed it truly was. There was not a single table available inside and the line was to the door. My husband and I decided to just go with their specialty pizzas. He got the meat lover and I got the white top. The pizzas are made like any food line (chipotle, panda, etc). We sat outside because it was empty and quiet, that didn't last long. Within 10 minutes every table outside was filled.
It was great that it comes super fresh right out of the brick oven. They're individual sized pizzas and very thin crust. It was tasty but nothing memorable. I preferred my husbands pizza and took the rest of mine home. They have to go boxes left out for you to grab at anytime.
If you're looking for a family friendly place then this is the place to go. Personally in my opinion, there were too many kids running around like I was at a chucky cheese.
With how packed this place was I assumed the pizza was going to be pretty amazing but I feel like I've had much better. Most likely I won't be back."}
{"text":"My favorite thing is how unlimited the choices on the pizza really are. You could mix up the craziest toppings and somehow, it still manages to taste delicious? Changed the pizza experience for me because I can't stop thinking about the pizza when I'm going to and from school haha. It's perfect for sharing with another person. The staff are awesome and always so enthusiastic to be making your pizza, which always makes me that much more enthusiastic to eat it. What a great idea for a pizza place, ily blaze"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pizza. Fresh ingredients, you can make it any way you want. The place is nice too and rustic; good place for a cheap date or if you just want to munch."}
{"text":"I absolutely love blaze pizza! I think this place is amazing. The crust on the pizzas are perfect and the taste is supurb! Honestly If you're craving pizza this is the place. Just do the create your own pizza and get what you like."}
{"text":"When I moved from NY to California my first thought was where I was going to get pizza and bagels. That was where I was introduced to Blaze. Then I moved to Las Vegas and had to say goodbye. As soon as I moved here, low and behold, Blaze is opening in Summerlin!!!  Happy, happy, joy, joy!  Finally got to get my pizza. I love the build your own option. I get a ton of veggies on my pizza and it is delicious. 
The restaurant is is bright and modern but the brightest star are the employees who work there. Friendly and conscientious making sure we were enjoying our meal. We definitely were. Give Blaze a try and build you favorite pizza. We can't wait to go back  
Still looking for bagels and bialys!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Blaze Pizza in California. When I found out there was one being built in Las Vegas I instantly got excited. Before coming here I did have reservations about a good restaurant opening in another state. This location far exceeded my expectations. The staff is AMAZING and friendly, the managers walk around and greet people, and most importantly the food is outstanding. I love Blaze and this location. Absolutely a must you try this place."}
{"text":"I went in there, it was dead inside. I ordered a regular pepperoni pizza and the worker  who did my pizza gave me plenty of attitude. When I had enough of it, I asked for the manager and she said she was the manager. Her name was Constance. Overall the management sucks over there. Only reason I'd come back is for the unlimited toppings and not the customer service."}
{"text":"High quality pizza and the taste is wonderful ! The service was excellent ! Really affordable price, highly recommand"}
{"text":"Tried this place the other day after a friend recommended it, and man am I glad we did! 

As everyone else has said, it is very similar to Chipotle and Subway as you can really customize your own pizza. And you can't beat the price. In my house, this is especially appealing as no one can ever agree on what kind of pizza they want. 

The staff is very friendly. My husbands pizza got a little burned on one side and they quickly offered to make him a new one. I was very grateful, as there was no way he was going to eat it in the state the first one was in. 

I was a little disappointed that they only have one size pizza. I feel like they should have some sizing options. Or at least a kid size one. I know my little one did not even get close to eating even half of the pizza she got, so a kids size option would be amazing.

Overall, it's a pretty solid place and the food wasn't half bad."}
{"text":"The number of topping & sauce options is great. I would have preferred my pizza cooked a little longer, but it was delicious. The line at lunch was long, but it moved fast and it didn't take long for the pizza to come out. A couple of people got the s'more pies for dessert and we're a little disappointed. Their blood orange lemonade was a favorite among our group. The staff was very friendly. It's definitely my favorite build your own pizza place that I've been to so far."}
{"text":"The pizza is great - it's so simple and so flavourful. i had the chicken pizza and it was really yummy!

They also have these cute takeout boxes on the side for your leftovers, which was really nice because these boxes are small (easy to carry) and maintain the integrity of your extra slices. I just love having that, instead of carrying a big whole pizza box!! 

Would have gotten 5 stars, however I didn't like how my pizza had some parts of the crust that were crunchy and that other parts were soft, and also I feel like the pizza needs a bit more sauce!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza!But today I ordered 3 pizzas online and went there to pick up my pizzas and waited ...They set my pizzas up on the counter and I politely asked the woman that worked there if they were mine and she just blatantly said no without even checking, then I waited 15 more minutes and I asked again and she then told me they were mine ,but didn't apologize and now I got cold pizza because this worker was incompetent!very frustrating because the pizza is great!,But the service today was awful!"}
{"text":"This place is a notch higher than its competitor down the street in almost every aspect. My wife has wanted to go to Blaze once a week for the last three weeks.The most significant difference is the selection of cheeses. She especially likes the ovalini mozzarella. I like the goat cheese.

Give me the regular crust with a layer of the spicy red sauce, load it up with plenty of meat and cheese, and I'm happy. If the thinner crust isn't your deal, then you can opt for the high rise crust. I haven't tried any of the salads and the pizza fills me enough where I don't have room for the s'more pie, but pictures look fantastic. Calorie counts for the ingredients are also a bonus but when the count reaches 4 digits the math gets to laborious and I just say forget about it and go nuts. Excellent display of discipline there don't you think?

Ordering has always been easy and the employees have always been helpful. Even while you're eating, they're always checking on you to make sure everything is meeting your standards. Each time we've come, it's been later in the evening and the lines and waits were minimal to none. The customization obviously allows for endless combinations that you already like or ones that you'd like to experiment with.

I don't have a preference of which of the neighboring places I'd go to because they're both good to me. But the boss lady likes Blaze, so we'll be there when we want our custom pizza."}
{"text":"I think I have told people about this place at least 6 times since I attended the Yelp event on Tuesday. When I first heard 'build your own pizza' I couldn't contain my eye roll imagining it would be like a subway of pizza shops- generic and underwhelming, but Blaze is anything but generic. 

I had the gluten free pizza crust which was actually tasty, not like the cardboard you get at some other pizza joints. The staff was super accommodating and even offered to change their gloves to avoid gluten contamination, wow that is what I call service. This place has several different sauce bases to choose from including a pesto and several marinaras. The toppings all looked amazingly fresh including an assortment of cheeses (goat, gorgonzola, mozzarella, and many more). 

I had the pesto base with gorgonzola and goat cheese, spinach, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, grilled onions, roasted red peppers, and oregano. The pizza was divine in terms of the quality of toppings. I do wish the crust would have gotten a bit more well done - but maybe the gluten free crust doesn't crisp up as much as the regular crust. 

Also, had the arugula side salad with berries and cheese. The salad was good, but the staff was a bit heavy handed on the balsamic reduction, so if you don't like super sweet salad as for the reduction on the side. Over all though I was impressed with this place and will definitely be back soon! 

Pro-tip: if you come at sunset bring your sunglasses because you will be blinded by the sun as the place doesn't have any blinds to keep out the bright rays."}
{"text":"Cold weather, long day at work, and a desire to sit at home in sweatpants cuddled up with a boy and pizza, that was my goal tonight. The first three goals went according to plan; the pizza however did not go over so well. Ordered two pizzas via the app after having such an amazing experience at the location in University figured I should try out the one near the house. Walked in as they were firing the pizza (no worries I wanted it fresh) the pizza came out black not just a little black a lot black. The spinach was charred to the point where I would have been eating nothing but carbon. In contrast the red onion on the pizza was literally raw. 

Instantly asked them to refire them at first the guy was trying to cut off the black bits - that is fine if it just a bit I get fire will do that to pizza, but it was the whole thing. They did refire the pizza, but I had to wait an additional 10 minutes only to get pizza that was ultimately undercooked. Got home and had doughy pizza that was completely inedible. Not my idea of a good date night or good pizza. Extremely disappointed considering the pizza I had at the University location was literally all I could talk about for almost two weeks. 

Not sure I will go back after tonights fiasco."}
{"text":"Who knew this would be the best pizza in Charlotte?! The staff and owners were so friendly and welcoming! Every time I've been to a pizza place I like their pre-made ideas, but I always want to tweak a thing to two. It's so great you just get to make your own here! 

My pizza was delicious (best I've had in Charlotte) and it was cheap! I piled on the ingredients, but the cost stayed the same. $8!!! They have fresh ingredients and excellent cheeses. You can tell they really focus on having great ingredients. I also love that you can add arugula and pesto at the end after it has been cooked. It only takes 3 mins! 

Also, this place is built with recycled materials, so another point for them! I have told everyone how amazing this place is, so we will definitely be back. I was so impressed. Great quality and great price. My new go to spot. I'm excited for them and love that they want to give back to the community."}
{"text":"What a SH*T SHOW. 

Adequate enough pizza, but whatever you do, DON'T buy one of their giftcards. I received an email this morning for a free pizza if you buy a $25 giftcard. I did so, and then - couldn't use the giftcard number to order from their website OR using their phone app??? WTH???

I'm finally done with this place. I've had numerous other problems/issues with their limited website/app access, so I'm just moving on now.

For just 'adequate' pizza, it isn't worth the problems one has to wade through just to place the order."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The same concept of Chipotle. You choose your toppings and they make the pizza right in front of you, it's very tasty. The staff is VERY friendly with outstanding customer service. I am definitely telling everyone I know about this place."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE the options of endless toppings @ Blaze. All of the standard toppings plus many that I wish (in the past) might have been offered by other places. When you make your own pizza, they don't nickel and dime you on your toppings -- it's one price. I love that they have a gluten free crust too. Non-GF is better (isn't it always?) but the GF is pretty good. Liking this place! Blaze is one of the brands for the latest transformation in the world of pizza, but I like their version of it a lot."}
{"text":"Got in before the evening rush and scored the one topping pizza for 6.45! Made to order, the line crew was friendly, fast and efficient. The interior is modern, simple and basic. There's plenty of seating and fountain drinks ( coke products), blood orange lemonade and original lemonade. The service and experience first time here was stellar!! The crew is upbeat, energetic, and seemed to work in unison.. Pizza came out super fast and really good!! Stop by this location for a quick pickup meal and keep it pushin'.. Way to go Blaze! \"I'll be back\" great first impression!!"}
{"text":"Blaze is crazy amazing! It's like a subway but pizza! I go there once a week! You walk in and feel welcomed. You can build our own pizza and get a drink for less then $10! That's freaking crazy!!!"}
{"text":"This spot was pretty good. I got a gluten free crust and I thought it was super cool they ask if it was preference or allergy. How thoughtful; I know people with gluten allergies and when restaurants are not careful it can ruin their week. Fortunately, for me it's just a preference. I got to build my own pizza for the same price as a pre-designed pizza which is pretty cool. They go ahead and make your pizza in the brick oven as soon as your order and they call your name when you're ready. For how fast they make your pizza I thought it was pretty fresh and pretty delicious. If you eat Paleo like me (most of the time) this is a great place. The one thing I didn't see is dairy-free cheese that would make everything wonderful, but you do have the option of getting pesto instead of red sauce or white sauce. Not a huge tomato fan, but I don't really like the calorie count white sauce, so the pesto is a really great medium for me. I thought the interior design is pretty cool, very homey, yet upscale. If I wasn't trying to cut sugar I would've really tried one of their Agua Fresca they looked refreshing! I stuck to my soda water with a hint of XXX vitamin water for flavor. Overall, I give it four stars; still missing that dairy-free cheese (like Mod pizza), but I love what I got and it tasted delicious ."}
{"text":"Came back today for another amazing Build Your Own Pizza experience. The staff today were extremely friendly and recommended some new things to try with our order - shout outs to Cecil and Jude!"}
{"text":"My first time there. I ordered online, a pizza for me and one for my roommate. I got there and one of them was being boxed up. It was burned black across one side, and they were going to give it to me anyway until I asked them to remake. I got home with the other one and found that mine was made incorrectly. It was still good food, but I'm not okay with spending money on food that isn't what I ordered. That's not how this works."}
{"text":"I checked out BLAZE pizza at a Yelp event and I must say I was very impressed.

This restaurant located at Yonge and Dundas is a hot spot for those looking for a filling, fast and delicious meal.  Of course you have to be in the mood for pizza and realistically I am ALWAYS in the mood for pizza.

The restaurant is spacious and the front counter allows you to see all the delicious toppings you can choose from as well as the big fire oven where your pizza is made in 180 seconds.

The menu consists of signature pizzas, build your own pizza, salads, drinks and dessert.  I tried a few of the signature pizzas with the Green Stripe being my fav.  It consists of pesto drizzle over grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, chopped garlic, mozzarella and arugula.  

We also were able to go behind the scenes of the kitchen to make our OWN pizza!  The ingredients and sauces were plentiful with unique options to choose from.  You can pick a nice spicy tomato sauce, white sauce, pesto, lots of different cheese, meat options, tons of veggies, spices and even sauces to add after your pizza is cooked!  It's an exciting time when you get to customize your pizza to perfection.

Overall I had an amazing experience at Blaze and can't wait to go back for more of their delicious pizza.  One thing I have to mention about this location is how incredible the staff are.  Each and every person working that evening exceeded my customer service expectations and truly made the experience one to remember.  They all seemed to really love what they do and everyone seemed to feed off their energetic and positive energy."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, amazing service! Went during lunch hour on a Friday. Lots of people there but the service was super fast. Maybe my new favourite pizza place in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I tried it on its opening day. Verdict: Although the staff is incredibly attentive and friendly, the pizza is ok. 

You start off by choosing between sauces: Classic red, white, and spicy red, for example. Then they send your pizza to the toppings person (Chipoltle-style) and there is no limit to how many toppings you want, and let me tell ya, the variety is impressive. Goat cheese, garlic cloves, banana peppers, arugula, caramelized onions, feta cheese, to name a few. Then they send it to the oven. 

3 minutes. Done. 

The pizza is thin and is cut into 6 small slices. It was good, but nothing extraordinary in taste.

The best thing about Blaze was the staff. They come to your table and offer to bring drink refills and to-go boxes to you."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite to eat as we rolled into town. Large variety of toppings to choose from. Our 4 yr old son loved it and loved watching the pizzas cook in the wood fired oven. Staff was friendly and service was quick. Had Parmesan and red peppers to take to your table to add to your pizza. Would highly recommend this for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious and affordable pizza. they don't deliver, FYI. I ordered and paid for my pizza through Yelp. The confirmation page will tell you the time to arrive in the restaurant, and that after checking in at the store they'll put it in the over for you, so I ended up waiting five minutes or so for it. I'm glad I ordered online bc there was a line when I arrived. Made my way to the front of the cashier, and that was that! 

The pizza itself was good too. Can't beat unlimited toppings for $7.95. My only complaint was that the pizza wasn't crispy like a thin crust pizza. But that could be due a number of things - one is that I drove ten minutes home before I could eat it, and two is that I got the pesto drizzle on top. The pesto drizzle it was good though! There's only one pizza size (11\") and that is probably enough for two (or one if you're a big eater). 

Staff was very friendly too. While I was waiting for my pizza, someone on the floor was bussing tables, refilling drinks, asked if he could get me a drink while I waited, etc. 

I can't wait to sit on their back patio!"}
{"text":"What a great idea! It's like a subway for pizzas. Tried this out on recommendation from a friend, so glad we came here! 

My husband, son, and I came here for lunch and we were all very pleased. My 2 year old had the simple pie, husband has the art lover and I had the white top minus the bacon. They ask you if what is going on the pizza is ok and if you want to make an revisions. When you order, all the topics are placed in front of you and it really is fast fired. We had our few within minutes of paying and finding a seat. The blood orange lemonade was really tasty! I've never had that flavor before and totally loved it, I would even come just for that.

The sizes of the pizza are all the same. It was nice that because I did not have the bacon on my pizza, they charged me less--they didn't have to, but what great customer service! All the staff are really friendly and happy. All the pizzas were delicious. I'd love for them to cater!!! Thank you for coming to Henderson!"}
{"text":"Pieology is better, but this is MUCH closer to my house.  The crust is not as crispy and they have less options for the sauces.  But this is slightly cheaper and they have similar if not better options for toppings.  Food comes out quickly..but I think I prefer the number system at Pieology where they bring the food to your table versus calling out your name to go pick up the pizza.  In terms of toppings, I like the sausage here a lot better than Pieology's sausage.  All other elements seem similar, but they do have a few additional toppings here that are not available at Pieology.  They also serve beer and have blood orange lemonade.  The restaurant is big and spacious.  The employees are friendly.  Liking this new addition to the North Las Vegas restaurant selection =)"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now based on some recommendations from friends and honestly, the experiences so far have been both very good and very bad. Consistency is definitely an issue at the moment. It may have to do with the staff working or something else.. I am not quite sure to tell you the truth because the service is quite consistent, but the quality of the pizza itself fluctuates (crust is firm and nice vs. soggy; cheese is flavourful vs. not a lot of flavour). I'll go again and report back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Stupendous! The crust is thin and crunchy and toppings were fresh. Great concept! Surprised they don't have more locations yet!!!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back here and am never disappointed. Literally never.

The prices are so reasonable for what you get. Unlimited, truly unlimited toppings. Think they added too little meat? Ask for it again. And again. And again. Want gluten free dough? Ask for it. Want extra sauce? Again, all you need to do is ask. The dough is always on point and fresh and perfectly baked. The toppings? With that many people coming in and out, it's always fresh as well. The half boxes is such a clever idea I'm surprised no one really did it before (that I know of).

The service is always great and not your typical fast food service. In the short time you're ordering and choosing toppings, you've probably gone through 3 or 4 people. At least two of them will make a personable comment and be so cheerful that it's infectious. 

If I had to say something negative, it would be that there's always a long line and that it may be difficult to get seats if you're in a group. But hey, you can't really knock 'em for being successful if the quality is consistently top-notch."}
{"text":"Visited Toronto and hit this place for a good pizza. We all built our own and the pies were all 5 stars. Cooked perfectly to a crisp and full of flavor. Wish they had this locally in the Detroit area."}
{"text":"They have a really unique concept. You go through the line and choose your toppings and then they place the pizza in a oven over fire right in front of you. Place was clean, price was as expected, food was so-so and staff was average. Would I return yes. Would I make a special trip um...... jury is still out."}
{"text":"Saturday 7/22/17. Came to this place to have pizza.  Been here a couple of times and today I've decided I will never come back.  I'll just go to Pieology.  I complained how they were so chintzy with their portion.  I asked if they could add more cheese and the young man gave an attitude.   Then when we tried to talk to the manager and he was a real jerk. Wouldn't  listen to us and talked over us and was raising his voice at us.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE.  It's sad the rest of the employees seems really descent but this young man and the manager has THE WORST customer service.  I will tell my friends not to come here.  So owner of this location if you're reading this teach your manager customer service.  It's the manager who's working at around 2:00 pm. They just lost a customer and believe me I will tell my neighbors and friend not to come to this location"}
{"text":"I usually bring my kids here at least once a month for a reward because they love how they get to make their own pizza and eat all of it themselves.  The last 2 times I had been in,3 of our 5 pizzas were burned. I complained the last visit and showed them the pizza and they said they were sorry.  They didn't try to replace it w a new one just sorry.  Too bad because I was super stoked and referred a lot of people here when it first opened.  Maybe the excitement is dying down but the staff doesn't seem as though they want to really help serve you."}
{"text":"I thought that Pizza Pizza coming up with an online pizza builder was a game changer but then I came to Blaze's. It's a Build-a-Pizza workshop come to life. The staff are friendly and walk you through on how to make your dreams come true.

If you're something of a basic (nothing wrong with that!) you can get a simple sauce, cheese and 1 topping pizza for about $8. But if you're like me and want to sample all the fine toppings that life has to offer, then I suggest the $10.45 build your own. You get unlimited toppings! However, I'd advise against overloading because your pizza will resemble a land-slide when you try to eat it. If patience isn't your virtue - don't fret. They say it takes 180 seconds for your pizza to be ready.

For the price it's awesome and incredibly filling! I couldn't finish it for lunch and ate the rest for dinner. The crust is more on the thin side, which I prefer. Also, they've got a great selection of cheese, sauce, and toppings. It's wonderful for those who are vegetarians or only eat halal (only the Italian meatballs are halal!). 
They've got a fountain drink station. Be sure to try the lemonade which is sweet and tangy. Also, grab an adorable Smore pie if you want dessert. They put it by the oven so that the marshmallow is melted when you eat it.

I wouldn't call it a restaurant as you have to place and pick up your order at the counter. However, there was a server who came around later and asked us if we needed anything else. Good thing is that there's plenty of seating so be sure to try your pizza as soon as it comes out the oven!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is so good!!! My girlfriend kept telling me about this place, claiming it's the best pizza in Toronto; but I kinda just brushed it off. Why do I even doubt her!? Blaze has quickly become my favourite pizza place in Toronto and GTA.

When I try to explain Blaze the my friends, I would say it's like Subway (but way better). You pay a single price (12ish) and then you go down the bar/counter pointing at all the toppings you want. The kicker is that unlike subway, you can pick as many meats/cheese as you want. If you want the best \"value\", you can even ask for everything. 

Advice, the line gets kinda long during lunch hours but you can order through their app. You pick whatever you want online and then just tell them to put in the oven when you get there. That way, you can skip the \"pick your toppings\" line. By the way, the first time you download and sign up to their app, you get a free drink."}
{"text":"Another impulse stop as we are heading out for last minute shopping! Super friendly staff & quick service! The restaurant is open and welcoming. They have fresh juices as an option for beverages. The pizzas are made fresh, similar to an assembly line style where you pick all your own toppings and they fire it for you at the end of the line. Hunny selected meat lovers with peppers. It is a good tasting pizza; the thin crust is surprisingly delicious (not normally thin crust minus New York style of course), so I was pleasantly surprised! Our only negative is that there wasn't even close to enough cheese! As you can see (or not) in the picture, it isn't even noticeable. Next time we know to ask for more. There will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizza's on line today.  They were absolutely delicious. I got arugula on one of them that I ordered.   As long as they pay attention to detail they will make it in Scottsdale.  
Good luck!!! We are a tough crowd!!!! 

Josh is great!!! 

Dawn and Mark"}
{"text":"Amazing! Fast and always good! Best crust I've had on a pizza in some time, the brownies and smores are a must try!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get a BYO pizza! The staff is really great! The location is great! Great place to take kids & family!"}
{"text":"Super good and super affordable! Not to mention the whole staff is super nice and welcoming! They actually seem like they enjoy there job! You can create your own pizza for one flat fee and its like 7.65 even with six toppings! I will definitely be a returning customer(: Not to mention when they cook it they get it to you in under 5 minutes! Fast, affordable and friendly staff. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Yum! I love this place! I load veggies on my pizza, and get extra garlic! They have to-go boxes, and it comes out in like 2 minutes!"}
{"text":"One word - FILTHY!!  Completely rude millennial staff!  Will never ever go here again."}
{"text":"Came here about a week ago and this place is bomb! The staff is very friendly and talks to you as they make your pizza. Less than eight bucks for unlimited toppings! I got a gluten free crust with vegan cheese (not highly allergic, just sensitive) and they asked if I wanted them to change their gloves. You can tell they want to cater to people with severe allergies. I piled on a bunch of veggies and a generous portion of grilled chicken. My husband got a white pizza with some meats and loved his. The personal pizza was enough for me to take half home. Will definitely be back since it was within walking distance!"}
{"text":"This place is solid, but nothing amazing.  The staff is friendly and helpfully if it's your first time, they also bring out your food to you when its ready. Like many other people I do think that a pizza with a bunch of toppings for under 10 bucks is a good deal, but mostly when I love it.  Here I didn't love it.  On pi day they had a nice 3.14 pizza promotion, maybe i should have come that day. As a three dollar pizza this place would be great, but as a ten dollar pizza joint its just average. I did like that they had some type of beer selection to go with your pizza.  At least that one ups dominos since they dont serve alcohol. The sauce is bland, the dough is tasteless and the thinness of the pizza makes it soggy with multiple toppings.  If you have no pizza standards this can easily be a go to place for someone working or living nearby on a budget. But why would you choose average pizza with better quality options on the same street for a similar or lower price? I wouldnt, but thats me. 

The location is on eastern so it gets a lot of food traffic and car traffic, waits here can be a while at lunch time too.

Overall, not a bad place for a quick pizza lunch but no where near the best,  If youre in the area for the weekend go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great concept.  I'd call this \"the Chipotle of pizza\".  And I mean that in a good way.  They have a super efficient production line figured out.  And it's great that there is no up charge for adding as many ingredients as you want. Not the best pizza that I've had in Charlotte. But certainly much better than average.  And to be able to get in and out quickly and get two pies for under $18... Can't beat that for a quick/cheap dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to this location before and realize how slow the night crew is. So I tried to order ahead on the mobile app so I can just pick it up and walk out at the time it's done. And when I came in to pick it up, I still had to wait another 10 mins cause my pizza wasn't even made yet. So many people working yet still so slow. But hey props to the Tempe lunch crew! They're awesome fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Move over Pieology - this location just opened and it's already my favorite build your own pizza joint in Summerlin!

The pizzas start at $8.95 and if you're not too hungry, can be big enough to share between two people. Service is fast and friendly, even when it's packed! They also have salads, desserts, beer & wine to enjoy with your meal. 

Aside from vegan cheese (Daiya brand) I do wish they had more vegan friendly options such as meats to add on the pizza or even other sauces aside from the marinara. But since they don't, we usually like the pack on veggies upon veggies on ours which still makes it just as good! 

I also love their Agua Frescas station that includes Blood Orange Lemonade, regular lemonade, Berry, and Matcha (which is our absolute fave and a must try!). 

They also have a dog friendly patio outside so bring your pups alongside you while you enjoy your pizza!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing pizza. What else do you need? You can choose from an array of cheeses, sauces, meats, veggies, and anything else your little heart desires. Not to mention they've got dessert as well."}
{"text":"Came in with my husband for lunch today. We left full and happy! The customer service was great, it was our first time and they very happily explained everything to us. We loved that there was one price no matter how many toppings you get, the desserts were also only $2, and the cane sugar soda and lemonades were awesome as well. 

We ordered a BBQ pizza and subbed jalapeños for the banana peppers. We also added spicy red sauce as the base, bacon, and pineapple. Same price. We also got a side Caesar salad, a brownie, and a smore pie. The crust was perfect, it was done quickly and we are the whole thing. The desserts were delicious! Also, all of the plastics and paper products were biodegradable and plant based. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Years ago, when I was on a poor student budget, the only thing I could afford was fast-food and the cafeteria food at U of T. Students these days are so lucky to have so many affordable meal options in the area. I'd have loved for a Blaze Pizza or something similar. Unlimited toppings on a pizza for a set price? Yes, please! You can also choose the type of crust and sauce you want, and the pizzas are cooked very quickly. For the price, it was a pretty good pizza! 

Thanks to my foodie friend, Raymond C, for sharing his pizza with me."}
{"text":"Came with my coworkers for dinner, chose the BOY. Loved that there's unlimited toppings for no additional cost. Wanted my pizza sweet and savory - coworkers pretty much wanted to toss theirs out and eat mine creation because they went basic. Have fun with your toppings!

Staff are super friendly too."}
{"text":"Good pizza but the online ordering system is poorly organized and the staff has a bit of an attitude. The online system gives the option to wait until you arrive to bake the pizza, but 80% of the time the cooks bake it anyway and it's there, getting cold when you arrive. The staff is unfriendly and not helpful. When they don't bake my order prematurely, I get blown off when I check in to pick it up. At least twice when I've been rudely encouraged to wait for my name to be called, they had misplaced the order, causing me to wait over 30 minutes before anyone realized what happened. I also had a cook argue with me when I asked to have my pizza remade and corrected."}
{"text":"Second time I have ordered online and pizza not ready when I arrive. Plus online ordering does not take coupons. I think this location has serious staffing problems. Twice I have left due to long line and understaffing. I really like the food and making my own pizza but management needs to be better

Update:
Justin, the new manager is great! He has staffed this location much better. However, online ordering still doesn't work."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying blaze pizza and I have to say I'm very satisfied! I got a personal pizza half Hawaiian and half with sausage, banana peppers and cherry tomatoes. The pizza itself was very delicious, and I definitely will be going back. The staff was friendly, offered samples to me and was able to answer all my questions. I think the portion is well worth your money because I couldn't even finish the whole pizza. I suggest Blaze Pizza if your looking for a more personalized quality pizza  rather than a quick pick up from a mediocre pizza place."}
{"text":"Unlimited toppings for build-your-own!! I love how the pizza manages to stay crispy (and not soggy) even when I load up the toppings. Excellent service, excellent food, and great price. Love this place. 

(Wish they had corn as a topping option though!)"}
{"text":"Just when you think you don't need another make your own pizza place, you try Blaze and you are glad you have another choice.

The Boy and I both enjoyed our made to order pizzas as well as the positive attitude of the staff.  They all really cared that our pizza was made the way we liked it and that we felt welcome as soon as we walked in.

Prices are nice as well with several different price point options for people like me who want sauce and cheese only (their Simple Pie), or even just one topping.  Instead of being charged the same as someone who goes HAM on toppings, those who want less pay less.  A nice addition to N Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It's pretty much the subway of pizza but with a better quality. An incredible amount of options to include vegetarian/vegan pizzas. Pizzas are about $10-13 each."}
{"text":"Friends had told us about Blaze but we hadn't had a chance to check them out. So glad we did today. 

Blaze has a neat concept. It's basically a \"build-your-own\" pizza spot, but not like your regular chain locations. They have every topping imaginable, from your choice of sauces (I loved the white cream sauce today) to turkey meatballs, vegan cheese, arugula (not getting that at a chain pizza place!) and even finishes like balsamic glaze and olive oil. If you aren't creative, no worries. They have \"signature pies\" to choose from, too... like the \"meat eater\", hubby's choice, and \"veg out\". 

The establishment was clean and staff members were all super friendly. I love being greeted by my name and they make sure to do so. 

Definitely worth checking out. Just hoping they add a location closer to home; I don't want to have to come just on workdays!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to pizza these days. Made to order, their signature pizzas are great, but stretch yourself and design your own!
Their gluten-free crust is good, but the best part is that they actually take precautions to avoid cross contamination. In addition to glove changes and covering work areas, Blaze has a bin of sauce dedicated to GF pies. Short of a dedicated gluten free kitchen, there's not much more they could do!
Fast, yummy, and cheap. Check them out! (or don't, because the lines get long and i don't want to wait) ;)"}
{"text":"Food is good despite being the MacDonalds of pizza. My issue tonight was with service. Ordered a double cheese, pepperoni, black olive and after telling him more cheese 4 times and really only got standard cheese amounts I am pretty disappointed. Phoenix definitely has it share of blondes and this location it must be a prerequisite to work there because the service was slow as hell.

Not a bad chain but I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Why go to blaze when you can eat cardboard for free elsewhere? This location has floor to ceiling windows directly facing the sun. While eating with my young grand children, I witnessed the middle aged manager (female, heavy set, 50's, no hat) loudly fire a pregnant girl in the lobby. She raised her voice and made no effort to do so out of sight of the customers. I will not return to any blaze and am appalled by the lack of humanity."}
{"text":"The build your own pizza option is fantastic! You can put a variety of toppings onto your own personal pizza and it's cooked in a wood-fire oven. It's roughly $11 plus tax which is an amazing deal for a fresh ingredient pizza made right in front of you.  

It's also a fast casual experience so don't expect the pizza to be made within two minutes of ordering but they're extremely quick.  I always add in most of the meats and veggies to load up my pizza which is amazing. You can also end off your pizza after it's done cooking with a drizzle of olive oil; nice personal touch! Overall, it's an amazing experience, would definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. They serve some thin crust pizza and it's not overly greasy. Think the opposite of Pizza Hut. I also like how you can customize your pizza with many unique ingredients and they don't charge premiums for certain toppings like every other pizza place. Gorgonzola, italian meatballs, spinach, etc. Get whatever you want!  You can also pick from classic sauce, cream sauce or spicy sauce. We tried the classic but I'd gladly return to try the spicy one next time. The pizza was pretty good and top that off with the great customization options and you've got yourself a great pizzeria."}
{"text":"Every time I go in I am never disappointed with the pizza. Every pizza I have gotten is a solid 10/10. It's not only the pizza that is 10/10, but the employees are pretty solid too. One in particular, her hat reads the name Raye. She always works with a smile and makes me feel like she really does care about the customers. Definitely a great hire. Will be back."}
{"text":"This place has become my new favorite pizza spot. High quality pizza made to order with extremely fresh ingredients. Imagine your favorite take out pizza spot where you grab a reheated slice to go if they were able to make your favorite pizza fresh in the same amount of time.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable to eat inside. But the real reason I keep coming is the staff. They have high energy service with a smile. I'm a huge fan of Blaze Pizza! Wish this concept existed when I was leaving my favorite bars in college."}
{"text":"Amazing concept.  Quick and easy.  Very nice people.  Very comfortable!  No rush!  Not a complaint!  Highly recommend you stop in if passing through Eastern.  I'm from NYC and say the pizza works!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We are big fans of Blaze.  The first time we ate here, I was kinda skeptical about the whole concept: a Chipotle of pizza, right?  Well, after devouring my first 180-second fired pizza, I became a Blaze believer.  First of all, the price is right for the Build Your Own Pizza, where you can add as many toppings as you want for $7.65.  Their Signature Pizzas, where the ingredients are already laid out for you, are also only $7.65.  I like the Veg Out, Red Vine, and the White Top for these.  Secondly, well, the pizza comes out fast!  And, thirdly, they are delicious, not at all greasy. 

This location is only two exits away from us so it makes it easy to get here and get our Blaze fix, which we've been doing at least once a week now.  The staff is super friendly and even if there's a line, it moves fairly quickly, plus you know your pizza will be ready in no time.  I usually can't finish the six slices that each pizza has, so my pizza is good for two meals, making my money go even further.  I'm lovin' it."}
{"text":"This place is similar to Pieology but I refer Pieolgy because they have whole wheat and gluten-free crusts. It's just as good except that the crust sometimes tastes? burnt or charred.
The food is not terrible and the staff is? really friendly. It's actually pretty good but there is something about this place that makes me think Pieology is better."}
{"text":"I almost want to give this place a extra star because my super skinny nephew never eats all his food and he killed a whole pizza here.  He jus got the plain cheese but my sister tells me he never finishes his food so that speaks wonders about this place.  I got the meat lovers(its called something else) with green peppers.  I ate at this place in Fremont California when a girl I know took me.  This place is like a subway but with pizza and way better ingredients.  The ingredients are fresh and the people behind the counter were very nice and helpful.  The restaurant is very modern and a hipster kind of aura around it.  They have a few pre made set ups but you can build your own and its a great way to mix things up.  Once you throw everything you want on the pizza you sit and they call you up after it comes out the oven.  The line starts all the way to the right behind the little wall.  On a little side note I bought my sister one of the remade salads and she devoured that s*** in like 2 minutes so I'm pretty sure it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Excellent concept, fresh ingredients, fast service. The only issue I have is a couple of the employees act like they could care less. This normally wouldn't bother me unless it directly impacts the outcome of my food and in a couple of instances it did. The first time the employee was just throwing the items on the pizza and half the ingredients ended up on the counter and the floor. When I asked her for more garlic she had this disgusted look on her face and said loudly \"you want more?!?!?\" Ummmm yea that's what I just said. Jeez. I should have told her if half my toppings weren't on the floor we'd be okay. She also forgot the tomatoes on the red vine pizza. When reminded, she again threw them on the pie. The second time the person finishing the pizza off sent our pies out \"undressed\". No olive oil drizzle on two pies, no arugula on the other. 

On a positive note: the other pizza finisher (short haired girl) is excellent. Never misses a beat and is always friendly and accommodating. 

I wish they wore name tags.... 

Five stars for fast fresh tasty food and overall great atmosphere and service. 2 people won't impact the overall experience and blaze is here to satisfy my pizza cravings."}
{"text":"Staff was great and friendly also very helpful, Build your own pizza was they way to go. So many toppings forget pizza fast food go for this. 

It was very quick and fast.

There has been very few places I would even write good review because of shitty service or bad quality food but when I find one they deserve the praise."}
{"text":"Love the pizzas here! Value for money is definitely on-point.

I always do the customized pizza with unlimited toppings - the choices are, plentiful, fresh, and gourmet all for one flat price (think feta, roasted peppers, kalamata olives, etc). You can also ask for more of any topping and the staff will gladly oblige without any judgement (and yes, my boyfriend asked for extra goat cheese, extra sausage, extra bacon). The crust is thin so you can really enjoy the flavours of the toppings. Service is also fast so great if you're in a pinch for time. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time visit here on Saturday evening about 5:30. This is a fast moving place. You go thru a cafeteria type line and place your order. About 5 minutes later the food is ready. 
I don't know why places seem to feel they have to season sauces with heat. Italian sauce should not really have heat. Pizza sauce doesn't need heat. If I want to add red pepper for heat, I will. Put oregano and other spices in and leave out the heat. 
The side salads are a ripoff. Highly over priced. Amounts to $4.95 for about half a cup of salad Too expensive for what you get The pizza was good and fast and hot. Flavor was good.
They didn't have enough seating for everyone. People who had been there before were saving all the tables for family who were in line. We had never been before and didn't realize we needed to save a table. Overall, food and service were good and will go back. Not fine dining, but, fast dining."}
{"text":"This was. So good. Like, the best pizza I've had in so long. 

I don't know about other people, but to me, this is what a pizza should be. Not totally smothered in cheese to the point where you can't eat anything, and not burned or thick. We actually didn't end up getting any toppings, we just got the simple pie, but I don't regret it at all, as just the sauce, dough and cheese made for a perfect pizza! Next time though, I'm definitely getting one of their special pies or get a pesto base. Just a tip though - it says beer & wine are served, but when we asked it appeared that they didn't actually have any, though we didn't really care about drinking in the first place."}
{"text":"In love with Blaze! Not my first time heading to Blaze, I go to the one in NoSco all the time because it's close to work. 

Sometimes you just need a fast and cheap option for pizza. No clue why this place has low stars. My pizza was great, simple cheese well done. Will be coming a lot more"}
{"text":"So, so, so, and did I mention SO good. I work around the corner and eat here probably 2-3x a week (I have a pizza addiction...sorry, not sorry). 

Have never had a bad pizza. Always consistent and they move the line along pretty well. I also dont feel nearly as guilty eating a 600 calorie pizza (ok ok ok, I know pizza isnt healthy but I gotta lie to myself to justify it). 

Pic below = simple pie well done."}
{"text":"You know the drill..... Go through the line, pick your sauce and toppings....all for one price. I love the concept because I love toppings! Unfortunately, the za here just didn't taste as good as other companies that have the same concept. I literally picked off the meatballs because they had a funky flavor. They don't have as many crust options as say pizza studio  and they aren't as super friendly as say mod pizza. I was also a little sad that when you ate there they give you teeny tiny cups for water meaning you have to get up 5 times while eating to refill. Oh well. Prices are average (under 10$/pp). They often have special coupons through Facebook, which makes it a better deal than other pizza places. I may come back (if I had a great coupon), but I would be more picky with my toppings next time."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this place quality pizza but it is one hell of a pizza for the price! 8-10 dollars gets you a nice sized pizza that you 100% created all for yourself! That is by far the most exciting part about this place! Yes I have had better and more creative pizzas in my life but getting to put whatever I want on a pizza without any question is awesome! People there are usually nice which is a bonus, it's kind of like fast food pizza so the quality isn't gourmet but it can compete with some of the fast food type delivery pizza places in town. Would go back again because the price is amazing and the creativity is endless!"}
{"text":"The food here is good and prices are affordable, definitely should try at least once. Blaze Fast Fire'd Pizza is a higher quality fast food restaurant. Best way I can describe it is \"A CHIPOTLE STYLE RESTAURANT BUT FOR PIZZA.\" To order you either chose from pre-determined ingredients signature pizza or make your own. You pick your dough, sauce, type of cheese, meat, veggies. Afterwards they throw your creation into an oven for a few minutes and it comes out crispy and delicious. I love either the meat lovers or barbecue chicken. Making your own pizza can be very satisfying too. The more toppings and the more colorful the better. Lines here can get a bit long because the workers move the pizza along in single file. They also have pizza boxes for taking your left orders to go. Overall, this is a good lunch spot with enough variety with the toppings that each experience will feel New."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza! Gluten free crust is good too! I always get gluten free crust with daiya vegan cheese. Just love the taste combo there. Of course I add other toppings too! 
Seating is plentiful..however it's not setup to be entirely private. Sitting outside is nice too when the weather is cooperating. 
I'd recommend this place for lunch or casual dinner."}
{"text":"Blaze of delicious, mouth watering, fresh tasting pizza! I have had this little gem bookmarked for a couple of months but kept seeing many Yelp friends checking in. After a long hike on Sunday, I suggested to hubby that we check it out. Little did I know, he had already been here for lunch with workmates! 

We walked in and there was a line but for obvious reasons. Your pizza is handmade to your liking!
When we made it to the front of the line we were warmly greeted by Chase. Chase was lively and entertaining to say the least. Hubby wanted to keep the pizza simple since it was my first time so I let him do the ordering. We opted for a fresh tomato/mozzarella with mushrooms. In addition, we ordered the arugula sale with fresh fruit. We looked around for plates and utensils and low and behold Deborah appeared and kindly explained that most people use the boxes to eat on. She even went as far as to tearing up the box and making us both plates. Next, she saw I was missing my salad and went back to grab it for me. Deborah delivered the best customer service I have received in quite sometime and she was super pleasant and happy to help. I immediately tipped her and expressed my appreciation for her assistance. I hope the management team knows what gems they have with both Deborah and Chase! 

Ok, back to the pizza. As my opening sentence expresses, sooooooo good was this pie! Wow! I did not expect this quality but my doors were blown off. I have been to a couple of other make it yourself pizza places, but hands down Blaze is the best I have ever had. I will be back here again and although I don't live near by, after my next hike in another week I will be stopping by again for more deliciousness! Good news!! There are opening a location closer to my house but I still am apt to return to this location based on the customer service alone!"}
{"text":"If you like thin crust pizzas, give this a try for sure! I loved the red sauce - to me the sauce and the crust are the most important elements in a pizza. After that their choices of toppings was amazing. I was very impressed with the assembly line - so organized and sensible! The pizzas took very little time to cook (in a very hot pizza oven as it should be cooked) so if you're short on time, no problem. I will be back and have recommended it to friends."}
{"text":"Soooo... Seen a long line as a drove by blaze about 9:40pm, so decided to gas up and swing back around and grab a pizza before heading home hoping the line would die down...lucky enough to find street parking, I walked to the door and encountered a customer looking dejected as two employees turned him around and i ask him what they say? \"they are closing taking no more orders\". I looked at my watch and was dismayed when it read 9:50pm, Then I glanced at the door which read closes at 10pm.... conflicted and a bit and confused I walked away with the dejected customer saying he drove far to arrive here on time. I then double down on my experienced to go get gas and hurry back over. He flashed a discount card and said the \"gatekeepers\" gave it to him and said they would maybe give me one.....I peered over one more time and seen a customer ordering and seen the \"gatekeepers\" waiting on the next unsuspecting customer so they can rattle off their canned response and I said nah not worth it! Talk about a bad impression, I don't know who decision it was to turn customers away during business hours but it was so ridiculous!  No problem Blaze,  I went up to South Boulevard to one of your competitors where the door was certainly open and no one guarding it."}
{"text":"Glad this opened up by me! Everyone working here was so nice and helpful! Pizzas were a good size for the price and delicious! Fresh and plentiful toppings ! The only thing I would want changed Is perhaps baking the pizza a little longer for a crispier crust. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Everything is great here. Staff , pizza, what ever we can say. Options are awesome and staff never hesitate to add more .... go give a try."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here and the lady taking my order was super helpful in explaining the process to me. I went with making my own and it was delicious. I also dig the blood orange lemonade they have, super yum!"}
{"text":"Today is the grand opening. I stopped in because I saw the promotion on the morning news. This is a build your own pizza place. They make it right before your eyes. Select a crust, choose your toppings, and get your pizza minutes later. The pizza is great. Thin and crispy, baked perfectly. I especially liked the spicy red sauce. There were managers and top people from the home office present to welcome all the new patrons. They took time to tell us about the pizza and about the company's history.This is worth the trip to Tempe."}
{"text":"Meh....it was only OK.

I absolutely love pizza and I am also a fan of this concept, however the pizza fell short. It was really, really super salty and almost inedible and I have no idea why.

Also, I don't think they can keep up with demand. We were in there on a weeknight and it was packed! Although the line wasn't very long, it took a ridiculously long time for us to order and get our pizza.

It's close to our house, so it's likely that I will give them another try and hopefully it will be better the 2nd time around."}
{"text":"I ordered an Art Lover (artichokes, mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, red sauce dollops) on gluten-free crust. The artichokes were mostly likely canned because they were briny and vinegary. However, they gave the pizza brininess which gave it the pleasant flavor of olives. 
The cheeses were extremely creamy and fatty (which is never a bad thing) so it gave the pizza the salty aftertaste I was longing for. 
These toppings were generously put on top of a gluten-free dough. Because the dough was free of gluten, it was crispier than the regular pizza dough. PIZZA ORDERING TIP: If you enjoy New York style pizza, order the gluten-free crust. But if you enjoy Chicago style, order the dough with gluten. 
Tomato sauce was dolloped on the pizza before heading to the 600 degree oven. The sauce was a little bland; lacking traditional seasonings such as oregano, basil, and garlic. However, the flavor of the toppings made up for the flavor of the sauce.
Blaze Pizza is an amazing restaurant to go to if you want Italy meets modern America style pizza."}
{"text":"Very first Blaze Pizza experience.  AWESOME and DELICIOUS!  Can't wait to go back.  Salads look amazing, saw them after ordered pizza.  Excited they are in our neighborhood!  Manager super nice too!"}
{"text":"Food: individual thin crust pizzas. I like the BBQ Chicken pizza (minus the Gorgonzola), hubby likes meat eater and kiddo likes pepperoni pizza. I also like the salad pizza with caesar salad, but only when I dine in. Usually I can't finish the whole thing, but I take it home for a snack later. 

Service: fast unless they are having a school fundraiser and then in that case you are screwed! ;-). Also can order online and earn reward points. 

Ambiance: casual with outdoor patio seating but not dog friendly :-(

Location: across from KFC."}
{"text":"Pizza was thin and on the bland side. Numerous Toppings. Friendly staff. I was impressed by the speed of baking. I was just expecting more."}
{"text":"Pros:  Cheap. Lot of options.  Tasty.  Fast, if the stars align.

Cons: I think that maybe when I went some of the staff may have been new hires. Hopefully this is the case. People working the line seem disorganized; they try to do too much at once. Often find myself having to repeat my order, or getting wrong things put on my pizza. 

What made me take stars away, mostly, is the way they handled a mistake they made. One time, they dropped my pizza, which is a perfectly honest mistake. However, when asked what was on the pizza the girl was rude and didn't pay much attention to me. Okay, I just wanted it remade. However, I did get bothered when I had to wait 30 minutes for my new pizza to be remade while they served many other customers that came in after me (on average it takes about 6 minutes to get a pizza.) I came up to ask if they had put in my original order again after waiting for a while and got shooed away without them caring that I had waited so long. 

Overall would eat here again. Good food."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome pizza fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection. Delicious. Do yourself a favor and make sure you get ricotta it's amazing."}
{"text":"When you walk in this place don't be over whelmed! If this is your time let them know that and have one of their staff walk you through the processes because you don't want to miss out on anything! Especially that you can get as many toppings as you want for 8 bucks! They do have a cheaper one topping pizza I am guessing is for kids because what adult would not want to load up their pizza with their exciting line up of cheeses, meats and other toppings. If you are feeling overwhelmed they have some popular pizzas that you can choose from. One of the most impressive things is how fast they are even on a busy Friday night we only waited about 15 minutes from building our pizzas to them being baked and ready to take out the door. I do wish they had some more crust options they do have gf, but a nice wheat or other flavors would be good."}
{"text":"This is the second of these instant pizza places that I've been to lately and it's a great concept. It's like the Subway/Chipotle model of made-to-order pizza. It's quick, it's custom and it's tasty.

They have a handful of \"set\" combinations, but those are nothing more than hints. Meat lovers, veggie lovers, that sort of thing. But they're all completely open to customizing as you and your pizza make your way down the toppings line. And yes, everything's a set price.

I opted to start with their \"White Pizza\" adding chicken and extra garlic. Once topped, it went into the oven and then maybe five minutes later, it was out of the oven. A thin and crispy crust with all the toppings nicely melted. Very delicious, if I may say so myself.

Inside and outside seating."}
{"text":"Look this place!!!!   At least now we can make our own pizza like sandwiches 
Good that it came around Aliante now"}
{"text":"First off the customer service here is amazing they are very welcoming and the staff kept checking on my family to make sure we was ok with everything. Now to the pizza it was very fresh and quick. It sure as hell beats a lot of these so called authentic Italian eateries in Las Vegas! Definitely give them a shot you won't be disappointed. Almost forgot it's also very clean I was going to originally go to pizza rev but left due to poor hygiene!"}
{"text":"A disappointment in this place since the last time we came here...not the food, but dirty. All tables were dirty with papers on floor.  Also where they bake the pizza all food on floor. Take a broom and sweep it once in awhile and wipe some tables..where is management?"}
{"text":"I eat pizza several times a week and this place is honestly one of my favorite pizza spots. Very delicious every time and I always look forward to coming here. I love trying new combinations and not having to pay extra for each topping."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their Art Lovers pizza on thick crust.  I add sausage, lots of roasted garlic, and extra ricotta cheese.  I omit the artichokes."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday 8-15-15 around 12:30 PM.  It's been a long time since I've been to a restaurant as great as this.  

For $19.84 I got a pizza, a caesar salad, and a drink.  Kinda steep for lunch but it was some of the most delicious food I've had in Las Vegas.  

For one price you get unlimited toppings!!! I really like that.  Some of the competitors charge upwards of $1 per topping (I'm looking at you, Novecento).  And they have a LOT of toppings!!  Even fancy stuff like fresh arugula and sea salt.  

And get this...the staff actually looked me in the eye and smiled...and most of them even looked like they bathed that morning.  Amazing.  First, you pick your crust, then sauce, then cheeses, then meats, then other miscellaneous toppings.  You pay and sit down and then they'll call out your name when your pizza is ready.  

Also, to-go boxes, parmesean cheese, red pepper flakes, and forks are sitting out so you don't have to ask for them. 

They have high chairs for the kiddos.  The decor is really trendy and clean.  I think I've found one of my new favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. Food is good, pricing is reasonable, customer service has been decent.

But tonight I came at 9:25 pm (you're open until 10:00 pm). I wanted to sit down and grab a quick dinner. Outdoor sign was turned off and all the chairs were up on the tables. It's almost like you don't want people coming in to eat your food after 9.

Message received, loud and clear. I went to 5 Guys, who incidentally, closes at the same time, and their chairs were on the floor."}
{"text":"A little over $10 for unlimited toppings on your pizza? Who can say no? And the pizza is made fast before your eyes with fresh ingredients ?? 

This place is great for lunch or dinner and has spoiled me enough that I never want to have pizza that's NOT from Blaze ever again. 
 The only thing that sucks is the large line that forms during rush hours."}
{"text":"I had a great experience today coming in. The young lady helping me out gave me a great breakdown of the menu and how everything works. She was very friendly and ill definitely come back again for more pizzas!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I might be a little bit in love with this place!

Blaze is like the birth child of Burger King and Subway.  Choose your crust and mosey down the line to have it your way, right away!  No matter if you want 2 toppings, or 10, just pile it on.  Completely customizable!  Watch them pop it in the oven and it's out in no time at all!  

Crust options include regular (which is fairly thin), deep dish, and gluten free.  From there, pick your sauce.  Some options here are white, traditional, and spicy.  The spicy is my favorite!  After that you can just start shouting out topping options.  You name it, they have it; traditional to eclectic, it's all there.  Needless to say, I got a little carried away.

The size of your pie is perfect.  Some would say it's ideal for one, others would agree that it's easily sharable for two.  Want dessert?  Grab a s'more pie!  They will heat it up for you too!  A little messy, and not nearly as good as the pizza, but there as an option for you nonetheless.  

I will say I'm going to have to go back to try this blood orange lemonade that everyone seems to be raving about.  I'm not really sure how I missed that!  Yet, at the same time, I'm not concerned since there's no doubt I will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Very good pizza. Loved the dough and the toppings were excellent. They even have feta and goat cheese available for pizza. I rarely see that in places that serve pizza. Also, I am not much for thinking crust, but there crust was awesome. Totally loved it!"}
{"text":"There is no shortage of wood-fired pizza places around, and I haven't had a particularly bad experience at any of them, but Blaze is reasonably priced with good quality ingredients (dough doesn't use enriched flour). So, thumbs up."}
{"text":"We ordered online, picked it up within minutes pizza was kinda thin very similar to MODD PIZZA. But it was great it tasted delicious! Service was good when i went in to pick it up"}
{"text":"The Chipotle of Pizza minus those crazy E. Coli issues and lawsuits! I've always loved Blaze ever since I tried it back home when they opened near UCI. Since then they've closed and I was really happy to find a Blaze open up in Charlotte. We walked in last week for a build your own pizza lunch, there were no lines, which was awesome. Its been a while since I've eaten here so I wanted to sample a simple pie with red sauce for $5 (pretty good deal considering the size of the pizza) and a white top add onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes. Note: you can kill your pizza with all these awesome cheeses! I LOVE that their toppings are chopped up into little pieces! This was an issue at the Irvine, CA location, they wouldn't finely chop up their toppings making for one soggy pie, especially if you were going veggie with zucchini. This was about $8. Thin crust is awesome so I love these pies. They also don't smother you with toppings so you can really enjoy the combination of sauces, cheeses, meats, and veggies you selected. I would avoid the sea salt if you are even the slightest sensitive to salt, it gets really salty! 

There is plenty of seating and the staff is very friendly. Definitely coming back for more, oh I'm going to get so fat."}
{"text":"I'd like to give a 3.5 star. This place is like the chipotle of pizzas! You can build your own pizza and customize it anyway you like, choosing from a big variety of toppings, sauces, dough thicknesses. The red spicy sauce was good, not too spicy. This isn't the best pizza in the world but it's good for a quick personal size pie that you customize. Nice wood burning oven cooks the pizzas well. The staff was very friendly and helpful in explaining how the place works. Bf and I each got a pizza and are very full."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying both times I've been here I got a free pizza through their opening promotions, so I may be a little biased. 
The ingredients all taste very fresh, and considering you are the one making the pizza, you know it will taste good! The thing I liked about Blaze compared to other build your own pizza joints is they don't skimp on toppings. Other places I have to ask for a little more every time, but here they get it just right. The snore dessert needed to be warmed up just a bit to melt the chocolate, but otherwise was pretty close to a campfire smore. The only thing I would avoid here is the pesto sauce as it was a little too oily.  This will probably be my new go to pizza joint."}
{"text":"Been going on here roughly twice a week since they opened and it's been great every time. The people are very polite and the food is fantastic. I don't know what some of the people leaving the bad reviews were looking for but my wife and I both eat there for less than twenty bucks so maybe if you're looking for a black tie place for that price then your expectations are pretty ridiculous.  Go check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with anything at Blaze Pizza. It's the  Chipotle of pizza joints. Fresh ingredients with any option you can think of to put on a pizza. I traditionally get the make your own pizza and add all the vegetables I can.

Even when they seem to be packed you can move through the line, order, and get your pizza within 10-15 minutes. 

I will and have been back multiple times to Blaze. It's been a great addition to the Southend area."}
{"text":"The pizza here is terrific. The quality of the ingredients is what does it. It's all so fresh and prepared so well. I like how you can customize with so many options on the menu. Varieties of sauces, cheeses, veggies and meat. It's rare to see so many options. And the prices are too good. The pizza here is worth double that. 
I've never been in to eat. I've ordered it through postmates every time. But I now don't order from anywhere else."}
{"text":"I liked Blaze. They have Great service and high quality food. I love the idea of making my own pizza and it is was out quick also. And it's super reasonable!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check out Blaze for the longest time! Finally did a few days ago and I'm sure I'll be coming here anytime I'm craving a quick bite of pizza. You can build your own pizza with unlimited toppings for merely $11.65..and that's exactly what I did! There were tons of fresh ingredients to choose from and the size of the pizza was quite large. They had a few seemingly yummy dessert options to choose from so I think I will have to try them on my next visit!"}
{"text":"First time there, I got the high rise crust which meant for two dollars extra I got my pizza and seemingly another small Crust under it which separated so imagine that crust sliced in half like layers of cake. They were about to close so I said nothing and trashed the majority of it."}
{"text":"Fun place, I guess it can be chaotic but the servers are pretty patient and friendly and welcoming!
I think the best deal would be the Build your own pizza for 11.49. All the toppings you want - though they apply the toppings in tiny sprinkles so you just have to ask for more if you wish. 
I love thin crust pizza, though I would've liked this to be more crispier (I'm sure I could ask them to leave it in for longer). Delicious overall and a good experience. 
Not the best tasting pizza ever but it was pretty good. Especially for a personal, build your own pizza, it is a great deal. 
I found the tomato sauce a bit on the salty side."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
At last the chipotle style pizza chain is here in Champaign. Although there are higher end make your own pizza places like pizzeria antica or similar restaurants such as pies the limit, however there is a place for Blaze in my heart. I personally like this the thin crust that comes with this pizza. If you select the build your own option, you get unlimited topping choices. The crust itself is thin crispy and light. These pizza are clearly for one person unlike the pies the limit pizzas. IMHO the topping are fresh and they have a variety of different cheeses and sauces to customize with. Another excellent point would be that the sodium content must be lower, I never leave this place wanting to drink copious amounts of water. The only hiccup we had was ordering pizza as we went with another family. Since they did not know how to order, I wanted to show them first. They messed up the number of pizzas I wanted to make which lead to some confusion when it came to paying for the pizza, however all and all this was a good experience and I will be back for more!

Pros: quick cook times, fresh ingredients, my favorite pizza crust in Champaign

Cons: Small tables, if you have a group of 8 or more with kids, it maybe difficult to sit your group

Health code rating: A. Very clean. The only thing that would be concerning would be the cleanliness of the pizza peel. This is the shovel that pushes the pizza into the oven. It can easily touch the ground when they are holding it after putting in your pizza and it is unclear how often they would actually clean this tool"}
{"text":"I love the idea of this quickly cooked pizza  and build your own options . I've been here twice , first time pizza came out perfect , second time the bottom was so badly burned it was practically inedible .  Not sure if the oven is dirty or the cook just let it bake too long , but it was pretty upsetting to get home  , prop my feet up and get ready to dive into my dinner  and see the bottom of my pizza was coal black   . The brownies are really good and I love to get them warmed . Hopefully the 3rd time will be the charm and it will be delicious again ."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 (Very good pizza. Love the pizza with pesto sauce.)
Favourite: The signature dish with pesto sauce.
Service: 4/5 (Very nice and passionate owner, fast service.)
Environment: 4/5 (Close to Eaton Centre, incredibly clean kitchen, nice place to chill after shopping or after a movie)
Price: $13 per person

I went to this place for an Yelp Elite event. I like this place. It is probably best fast food pizza. It is create-your-own pizza. I tried many variety, my favourite one is still pesto pizza. I like the thin crest and fresh ingredients here. We met the owner and all the staff members. The owner is nice and passionate. We also visited the kitchen, which was very clean. Depends on how hungry you are, but one pizza would be enough for 2 girls."}
{"text":"First off let me say this, thank you for coming to Las Vegas! Better yet, thank you for even existing! 

I'm a huge pizza lover. I love pizza and I love the fact that you can customize your own pizza for just 7.65 plus tax. You can build your own pizza or you can also choose from any of the signature pizzas they have created as well. Plus, they serve beers (: 

There were so many toppings and different types of sauces to choose from, so I just went with one of the signature pizzas and added some extra toppings to it. I ordered the white top pizza which consisted of the delicious white cream sauce, mozzarella cheese, bacon, chopped garlic, and oregano. Plus I also added some spinach and sausage as well. Once the order was placed, I didn't even have to wait long. They called my name in a matter of less than five minutes. Warning though, the plate of your pizza is very HOT! So be careful when you're carrying it to the table. 

As I bit into the pizza, all the flavors were just right. The sauce and the toppings balanced everything out. Never knew garlic was so good on pizza either! I couldn't even finish the pizza, but I love the fact that boxes were already up for grabs.  

Since it was my first time here, the staff were very helpful and answered the questions that I had instantly. They were all so friendly and they even came up to our table to asked if we were doing okay, two thumbs up for their customer service! 

Will definitely be back here again! Thank you for the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"My pizza sat in front of me for 10 minutes before the guy bothered to put in a box and hand it to me. They have you wait when you place a Postmates order for them to cook it in front of you but then they let it sit there and get cold in front of you as well. I will not be returning 

Update I went back to pick up another and had another horrible experience"}
{"text":"Pizza is good....The place is very loud....Chairs are hard wood no padding..the music they play is loud and strange....not sure if will go back..fast service"}
{"text":"This place is great! It simply the greatest $8 Pizza I've ever had. I had a Italian sausage, pepperoni, black olive with arugula with a fantastic crust."}
{"text":"I was planning to write something clever and witty and humorous about my visit here. But I can't stop saying \"oh my goodness\" over and over again. The pizza here blew my mind. I got a bbq chicken with tomatoes, mushrooms, ham, bacon, red onions, spinach, bleu cheese, and extra bbq sauce. Got a goat cheese arugla salad on the side. This place... Oh my goodness... Mind blown."}
{"text":"Not sure why they call it fast fired pizza, because my service was beyond slow. My mom, son, and I come in around 9 and there was no one in front of us. We come in and the girl who's first helping us was not friendly. So she takes our orders and then another lady helps us, then she passes it on to a guy who does toppings and then the second lady comes back. All in the mean time they just seem so unorganized and keep going from person to person. Ok about five minutes or so after all of the unnecessary confusion the pizza finally goes in the oven, which was the fastest part. I really like how they give you a to go box as your plate, it's a neat concept. They need to really re train their employees or something because it is their service I'm giving 2 stars and then the pizza was ok so I have another. Honestly pieology is much better, food wise and by far service wise."}
{"text":"So I guess they don't want business it's 6:45 PM I tried to order online but decided to call instead and nobody answered the phone!! let it ring more than 20 times also called back ...still no answer so I guess I'll be going to another pizza place"}
{"text":"I ate here last night with my husband and had a fantastic experience! What a great idea. Build your own pizza or order from the menu! They also offer gluten free pizza crust which tastes great!! I did think the extra charge of $3.00 for gluten free was a little much but in the end it was worth it. The service was great, friendly staff, beer , and an outdoor patio! I want to go back everyday!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The food was made fast, seasoned nicely and very reasonably priced. While the pizza was a little salty, my friend and I managed to enjoy and finish the entire pizza. It's a little cramped and seems to be busy all the time but, it was still a nice little restaurant. I will definitely be going back in the future."}
{"text":"Concept Is good.  Execution is not.  Staff always seem frazzled and very disorganized.  Not especially clean."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my pizza we tried the white pizza with bacon and the meat lovers which I added more toppings with no extra charge.  It's really a great concept like sushi burritos just one size pizza and then a side salad of Caesar very reasonably priced and I like the thin crust too."}
{"text":"Finally near me! I tried this place in Lodi, CA and now it's in vegas! I love that they have Daiya Vegan Cheese and vegan popcorn chicken :) makes me happy that I can build my own for 8.95 more money if you have vegan cheese and high rise dough but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the BYO-Salad. Went with coworkers from my office. Everything on the Blaze side was great. There was one issue however. A customer in front of me in line, maroon shirt, kansas city vibe, bearded man, stalled our entire order! Very unsatisfactory! He went through their entire supply of dough because he didn't know the difference between bleu cheese and gorgonzola!! Who doesn't know that?! And then he used up their reserve dough because he didn't stop them from putting on red onions! I've never heard of a pizza place running out of dough! Pretty sure they called around to other area Blaze's and this customer has done this at other locations as well! Very wasteful! Heard LeBron got word of the whole debacle!! Will be back for sure but will make sure to avoid this customer around Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wow! So impressed with this new pizza place in Scottsdale. Pizzas are made to order (a la Chipotle) & then fired in a traditional pizza oven. 

As a gluten-free eater, I was especially impressed with their gluten-free crust. (Regular crust is also available.) Unlike most gf crust, Blaze's was light and crispy, not floppy. 

I also enjoyed their array of artisanal sodas - the mango/orange was delish as was the black cherry. 

Service was super friendly & you can tell they've got good management - all the employees seemed to be having a good time. 

I'd never been to a Blaze before but you can bet I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious and is the reason why there are 2 stars and not 1.  The service, however, left much to be desired.

The line wasn't extremely bad when my group arrived, but it moved at a snails pace and quickly stacked up behind us, even to the point that I noticed several other groups leave because of its length.  As the, seemingly, supervisor made clear this was unusual for a Thursday.  After waiting about 10 minutes (about 630pm, dinner rush) to begin our order my friend, with Celiacs, asked for a gluten free crust.  The same supervisor informed us that they were out and it would take 10 minutes to make, again making it clear that it was not her fault as her manager told them to not make more....her words.  She was quite unprofessional in my opinion.

Once we did make it through the line, my friend waiting the 10 minutes for the gluten free crust, our food tasted good, but it is not the best of the BYO Pizza places I have been.

I don't see myself, or any other member of my group, visiting this Blaze again."}
{"text":"First time here. The kids behind the counter made us 2 great 12 inch pizzas. I had the meat eater with mushrooms at no extra cost and the GF had the BBQ Chicken.  Both were cooked to perfection and very tasty. They  have \" Build your own Pizza \" and it's only one price. Lots of topping. We will be back."}
{"text":"Top-notch fast casual food in the heart of downtown Toronto! What more can a person ask for?"}
{"text":"Quite good. Similar to MOD pizza. I like MOD a little better, more options and sizes, as well as a chewier crust. Just a matter of taste, they are both quality. The fast casual concept is pretty cool. Fresh, fast, and affordable. If you don't like what you ordered, you can only blame yourself."}
{"text":"amazing place you can choose your own toppings and have everything fresh and made to order. The people are super friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is open, airy, and good for groups"}
{"text":"I love going here for my weekly pizza fix. They have so many options and I enjoy being able to watch the work going into my pizza. The staff is friendly as well. It does look a little messy in the back and may need some more cleaning. One complaint I do have is the staff... while in for my dinner I was the only customer in, and an employee walked in the front door cussing, saying that he quit. The food is amazing but it was extremely unprofessional. I was not apologized for it either, and the man was just laughed at by the other employees. Since that incident I usually just order through the app to avoid any weird situations from happening again."}
{"text":"We love Blaze for fast, easy, dine-in pizza. Each of our family members can choose what they want.  Great concept."}
{"text":"First of all, I will be back. 

My friend and I came here for lunch on a Friday. I ordered the build it yourself, thicker crust pizza. BOY WAS IT AMAZING! Yum yum yum. I only had two slices since I was full from breakfast, but they were quick to order, fast for pick up, and delicious! 

I took the rest of my pizza home, but on my way to the subway, the take out book fell apart, so I ended up throwing away 2/3 of my pizza, which was pretty much a waste. Warning, do not hold the take out box with one hand. 

P.S. The server spelt my name wrong and instantly felt bad. Hahaha!"}
{"text":"I completely agree with Tiffany N on this one folks.  Once corporate left, the stinginess with the toppings began.  I mean seriously with the cheese?  I had to ask 3 times for the fresh mozzarella and all three times I got sidewards glances from the two employees on the line working the sauce and cheese area.  Literally- I could say that less than a 1/4 of a cup of regular mozza was thrown on and one fresh buffalo mozza ball was dissected into several pieces to scatter over what little regular mozzarella they put on-I asked again and they pretended they didn't hear me and I said in my most polite tone, \"could you please add a little more fresh mozzarella? I'm not adding any meat so could you?\" The younger east indian fellow, was nice enough but man you can tell that he was not happy about adding it, I mean really?!!!

I would like to point out that I am trying to eliminate gluten from my diet so I opted for the GF crust this time at a whopping $4.00 extra charge and the dough was fine...So I continued through the line up of toppings and kept it basic with sauce, cheese that I had to ask 3 times for, roasted garlic, and mushrooms- thats it.  I wanted to finish with some fresh arugula and pesto and keep it light so this pizza by no means was over topped to get grief over extra cheese.

Needless to say my pizza wasn't as cheesy as I wanted and was really lacking in flavour, thankfully for the basil drizzle, it helped a little. I got through about half and tossed the rest, just wasn't as good as my first or second pizza here.  For about $15 for the GF option, I didn't feel that my pizza warranted that steep price tag for lunch.

And once again tummy troubles, even though I steered clear of the meat, and went for the GF crust, I wasn't feeling all that great afterwards.  So I guess a 3 it remains as Blaze does offer a decent pizza but the stinginess on the cheese and possible cross contamination either with the meats or GF crust could pose and issue for some folks with sensitive guts."}
{"text":"I found this pizza place to be very reasonable. Personal pizza for 10.45 including as many toppings as you want. 

This is basically the \"chipotles\" of pizza places in the way they top and fire the pizzas. The oven is hot! And pizzas only need to be cooked for about 90 seconds before they are done so it's pretty quick from start to finish.

I got some of their signature pizzas- the red bone with spicy sauce and added roasted red peppers. This was simple and delicious. The second pizza was the meat eater which wasn't up to what I had hoped but was still good.

The pizza it's self was very good- the dough was crispy on the bottom and just the right texture throughout the pizza. I thought it was very good. The sauce was also very good, the two important parts to the pizza were working well. The toppings all looks very good and fresh but a suggestion to those people ordering- less is more, try and make simpler pizzas and they will taste better. The table next to us was complaining about how bad their pizza tasted and when I looked over, they had a monster topped high with every topping available. You can't blame the taste of the toppings on the place when you're the one that made bad choices!

Overall I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh, fast, and delicious fired pizza! I had half the Red Vine and Veg Out and enjoyed both of them. The Red Vine was very saucy and cheesy with a touch of basil so careful as it will drip off as you bite it. Meanwhile, the Veg Out was very cheesy and blue cheese. I also liked how the had a cool selection of juices and lemonade aside from pop to choose from. 

Blaze has a very casual, fast food pizza vibe. Great for quick bite with friends or before going to catch the movies. Take note one whole 11\" pizza is good for one person. Lastly, be prepared for a line up during peak hours. Otherwise, I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"As a speaker of multiple languages i am still trying to decypher the grunts and growls coming from the employees.  It took 5 attempts to communicate with the individual taking our order. When the pizza was ready the young man calling out our name resorted to a yawp insted of words.  The pizza was ok, nothing special. I would go to a sit down pizzeria instead."}
{"text":"As many have written, you pay $8.27 for your own personal 11\" pizza pie, with as many toppings your pizza can hold and then cooked to a crisp perfection (I always prefer mine extra crispy).

This is a good pricing point for lunch, any more, this place has nearby competition.  Blaze is in the same shopping plaza with fast food competitors like KFC with their $5 fill up, Panda Express with their Chinese combo meals, and Fausto's inexpensive Mexican lunch...  You get my drift.  

Onto, why this place deserves 4 stars. Places like Blaze is now catching on in Nevada, similar to the trendy ones in California like Pizza Press in Anahiem, Pieology in Fullerton.  This concept it not new to me, but nonetheless, I'm excited that we have one in Henderson.

All the ingredients are sitting on square and rectangular metal bins.  They look fresh, they taste fresh and the employees, though new, seem to take very good care on placing the toppings evenly on my pie.  

You can check out their menu, but they have some of my favorite ingredients like goat cheese, artichoke, arugula, minced garlic, fresh whole basil leaves soaked in water, spicy marinara sauce.  Again, these are just a few of my favorites, there is just so much more to choose from.

So far, customer service is on point and way courteous.  I easily devoured my 11\" pie in one sitting.  Vegan cheese was an extra $2, yikes!  I think they should mention it when offering that option."}
{"text":"A long overdue review.

I am from out-of-state, but decided to come to this establishment on National Pi Day (3/14) to take advantage of their deal. The line was super long as expected and I waited over an hour to get my pizza. I received my normal usual toppings (extra when applicable) and asked to have them bake my pizza \"extra crispy\". For this specific request, I expect them to keep my pizza in the fire oven a little bit longer. Unfortunately, it came out fairly quicker than usual, but I didn't question it since I know they are very busy at this time and day.

I chose to dine in and everything seemed to be going great! My first couple bites were normal and delicious just like how it always is. However, as I got into about 30% of my pizza I did notice this strange taste and texture. I didn't care as I was very hungry and have waited over an hour. Then, as I got into the next slice I really noticed it. My pizza dough was still raw! As I was chewing into my pizza slice, it had this gooey, sticky, plain taste to it. I looked on the leftover pizza I had (about 40% left) and the whole top layer and edge was still raw. I was able to grab a piece of the raw dough and stretch it out. No doubt, my pizza was definitely raw and not baked all the way even though I specifically asked for \"extra-crispy\". I would describe my pizza as about 80% cooked through so a couple minutes longer would have done the trick. I do truly understand that the workers were busy and trying their best. However, customers still expect to receive the best quality of the product as we are still paying and supporting the establishment regardless with a promo or not.

In the end, I decided to not bother the busy employees and baked my leftover pizza at home."}
{"text":"I love this place! I'm grateful that the prices are super reasonable for a custom pizza. This would be a good place to take a group of people."}
{"text":"This place is literally the Chipotle of pizza.

Get in line, and you have 2 choices.  You can pick a pizza off their list, or you can create your own.  My go to is the BBQ chicken with spicy red sauce, can't go wrong with it.  You watch them make it, throw it in the fire and boom...pizza is done.  don't forget to wash it down with the amazing, Blood orange lemonade....and while you're at it, just to make sure you experience everything Blaze has to offer...order a smore.  

now go take a nap."}
{"text":"Great food! We live close by and decided to try it. Glad we did. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. After hearing all of the hype, I was really hoping it would live up to it. Growing up in Chicago makes it a little tough to find a good pizza joint.  This place is amazing!  The pizza was delicious and cooked perfectly, and the brownie was to die for. The staff was very pleasant and thanked us for coming in. As someone who is new to the Vegas area, this was a great way to start my food tasting. Thanks Blaze!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For fast pizza this place is pretty good! The gluten free pizza is by far the best I have had in Scottsdale. Still a bit too thick (for us who like thin crust- crunchy style) yet is good!
Service was great and the servers were friendly!
For sure will go back for more!"}
{"text":"looked interesting onoutside inside food looked like pizza hut"}
{"text":"Great pizza.Build your own pizza has endless toppings. Besides the food being good, so is the customer service which is huge to me. Even though they were a little busy, I didn't feel rushed. Really nice people. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to return to Blaze after a Yelp event... it was actually only 2 days later. I'd been craving more every day. So why wait? I'm still not sure where to park for this place. I know there is curb parking, but other than that, not being familiar with the area, I was lost. I think there was a deck? But it seemed to be for residents? I don't know, I ended up luckily grabbing a spot on the curb. Walking up it is a vivacious scene. You see people eating at the outside tables, enjoying themselves. It makes you intrigued and excited to walk in.

I walked in and the line was pretty short. The employee  greeted me with a big smile as soon as I walked up which made me more excited... and then she just kind of looked at me. Had I not came before for the Yelp event, I wouldn't know what to do. They were so lively at the event and explained every step of the process. But not this time. I also noted this with a couple that was new to the place and came in behind me. So my first note is to offer more direction.  I mean this isn't your typical pizza place afterall. I order 2 pizzas and stepped down the line, really taking the time this round to build the exact pizzas I wanted. But it became pretty frustrating around the time to add my meats. I had 2 people asking me at the same time what I wanted on each pizza, literally. It was like they were getting impatient that I couldn't answer both at the same time! I eventually had to ask for 1 to wait while I worked the 1st pizza. Especially after I asked for more pepperoni and she literally picked up one pepperoni and place it on the pizza. Really lady? Don't Chipotle me! She eventually neglected my pizza and went on to the next customer. Which was actually for the better.

As I paid for my pizzas I grabbed 2 of the smores. They asked me if I wanted them warmed, but being that I had about an hour drive home, I decided to wait on that. She forgot to give me my credit in the app, then after the fact wrote down my name and said she'd post it in the back? Not sure how that benefits me in the App. As I waited for my pizzas I witnessed with the employees a couple attitudes and some yelling by the cutting station. As a customer, It was really awkward. I was thinking, do they know that we can see them??? lol. It was like getting a quick taste of Hell's kitchen. But as promised, a few minutes and they were calling my name for my pizza and I scurried out of there!

Literally the only thing that made me happy about this visit was that I knew the pizzas were going to be delicious and of course they did not disappoint. Every singling topping is so fresh and flavorful. None of that processed, pre-packaged mess. As you bite into the pizza it's not some big greasy mess in your mouth, you can distinguish between each topping as you chew. I got the Regular crust, but i'd be interested to see how the thin crust looks, as the regular seems really thin itself. But it bakes nice and crisp around the edges. I love it! And my favorite part is there sauce is the 1st i've had that does not give me heartburn!! I also never thought i'd be eating a pizza with Ricotta on it, but it's now my new favorite thing on my pizza. When I got home, I warmed one of my smores, not thinking too much about it. I mean it's just a smore right? Yes it is, only the most delicious smore ever! The cookie was so tasty and with the marshmallow and that nice milk chocolate, and i'm not even the biggest fan of chocolate, I generally don't like it. But I ate the other smore right away. As I hibernated that weekend, I ate those pizzas all weekend. Didn't share a single slice! They warmed in the microwave nicely, still maintaining the quality. Blaze is my new favorite Pizza spot!... Sorry True!"}
{"text":"These guys have such a stressful job. But let me tell you, they kill it every time. Last time I was in there was a really amped up guy handling the 2-3 man pizza oven all by himself LIKE A BOSS. I have never had a pizza from here I didn't like. Build your own with the thicker crust for the best bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"You had me at arugula!  I waited until the opening week \"jitters\" had hopefully been worked out and after they recovered from their \"free pizza\" day since I heard the line was out the door.  But I am pleasantly surprised by the new kid on the block in Southend.

I vaguely remember seeing a Blaze in Chicago, but I've never had the pleasure of trying it out until last evening.  I live within walking distance, so equal parts awesome and dangerous here.  It was a beautiful 70 deg evening so a lot of folks had parked themselves on the tables outside.  When we walked in, there was no line - the staff gave us the run down through the menu and their offerings.  I went straight up White Top (no deviations) and was super super happy.  Pretty much this close to buying a smore cookie, but I think I indulged my pizza craving enough for the evening and will definitely try one next time since they heat them up for you!

Hashani took the words out of my mouth:  \"The Chipotle of Pizza\"!!  Except they have way more toppings and choices to mix and match to your pizza heart's desire!  And you don't have to keep track of your bowl traveling down the line since there is a paper with your name on it and the friendly folks working the line definitely wear your name out, just like an old friend would.

The space itself is underneath the new Camden Apartments and has a modern/industrial feel.  High ceilings and graphic art on the walls, yet still warm with wood tables and concrete floors.  The dining area is separate by a staircase and a wheelchair accessible elevator and there is a station for extra cheese, oregano, and red pepper flakes.  I really like the tables outside since you get to people watch and see the traffic from East/West Blvd.  My apologies to the runners running by... I would hate to run by this place and watch people stuff their faces with pizza as I am a heated/sweaty mess.

Overall, pizza is the star here!  And super affordable.  I love the crust...I'm deeming it a \"Goldilocks crust\"... not too thick, not too thin.... just right.  Can't wait to be back and custom order the krap out of more pizzas....."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted pizza one night, I wanted somewhere new. She looked on her Yelp app and found Blaze.  I didn't look it up, just let her choose. We got there on a Friday night and it was quite busy. I wasn't prepared for a wait in line, one size only kinda pizza joint, but here we were. I noticed on the menu they have vegan cheese! (My daughter is allergic to cow juice!) Not only do they have vegan cheese, there is NO extra charge for it!!!! She was very excited to try it since the only one we've found in store was not too good.  It was finally our turn and the employee asked if we had been there before. Nope,  no problem! She talked us through the process and down the assembly line we went. My daughter got the (vegan) cheese and one topping (pepperoni) I got a pre designed veggie.  We took our seat and waited a bit (it was quite busy).  They forgot to bring my plastic cup of wine, so I asked for it when they called our number. No biggie, they apologized. The pizza was thin, crispy and delish! Her cheese was melty and good. My veggie was fresh and good! It was so good we went back the next night with 4 more friends!  
Give it a try!"}
{"text":"First off let me just that the customer service is awesome. Super sold people that care about the customer.

The pizza was pretty good! The chicken was kinda meh but everything else was fantastic so I was able to ignore that.

This place definitely isn't the best of all of the make your own pizza places but, it was not bad! If you are in the area and want a cheap and quick lunch, check this place out!

BB's Rating: FRIENDLYTASTIC"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  I love that my family can pick their own pizza and don't have to worry about who's picky about what on their pizza.  Customer service is great, they explain everything well and give you the time to decide what you want.  Also, their blood orange lemonade is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Today was definitely one of those days where you want something quick and near by. On the other hand I was definitely not going to fight the chance of getting another build your own pizza, I definitely love personalizing my own pizza that I do not have to share with the family.
So kuddos to whomever invented personal size pizza, with all those awesome topping options.

Today I went in 35 mins prior to closing, I was little surprised on how the staff was cleaning- normal restaurants start cleaning after the restaurant is closed. I normally wouldn't complain but after
Watching the employee sweeping and spraying chemicals. All I could think was derbies flying in the air. While I stood there I also noticed the smell of the chemicals. That's really something people don't want to smell before eating or near their food.
I definitely was a little thrown back and unsure if I even want to consume my pies. 
Given it's already late, I'm starving-I let it pass and ate a few slices. 
I really hope management will consider not letting there staff clean 30 mins before closing or while customers are still ordering. 
I understand the staff is young and eager to leave on time or earlier. Maybe the staff needs a closing  manager someone in charge of preventing this  disgusting experience from happening to customers.

Now I still plan on coming here, just not for dinner. This isn't the first time I'v seen them cleaning early. I just happen to experience, them cleaning while I placed my order. So yeah! Not really appetizing."}
{"text":"Seriously, who can even beat a build your own pizza for less than $10? 

BYO: Sauce - Cheese - Meats - Veggies / Toppings

They have quality ingredients and even better service! I really like the upbeat personalities of everyone I encounter. From the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out, they acknowledge you... and that's how it should be. 

Once you choose your pizza to your liking (they also have pre-set options) you pay for your creation and they bake it for ya and call you when it's ready. I like my pizzas with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, chicken, banana peppers, cherry tomatoes, and spinach. 

They will always be my go to pizza place!"}
{"text":"This pizza is blaaaazin' good! How many people do you think say that on the daily?

I enjoy this location very much because it is spacious and has a really nice outdoor patio. We came in after our intense work out over at Sin City Crossfit and it wasn't too busy. We shared a BYO pizza and salad. Perfect sizing for the two of us! 

What was on the pizza?
Classic dough, classic red sauce, mozzarella cheese, chicken, turkey meatballs, banana peppers, jalepenos, spinach, and tomatos.
What's in the salad? 
Arugula, seasonal fruit, goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette.

We also suggest getting the mango agua fresca! It's so delicious!
We sat outside because it was just some beautiful weather in Henderson.

I love blaze and I'm so hungry thinking about it."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite pizza - the spicy sauce is amazing! Super quick service, even when there is a long line. Great price. What else is there to love? I have been to three Blaze locations in two states - always a consistent experience. Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Again, a yummy pizza. Great price. Quick service. This is the largest location I've seen yet. If you've never tried Blaze, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"I love this blaze pizza! The employees are friendly and efficient. They have good beers on tap, and most favorite is their vegan friendly menu. They will change gloves if you prefer. Good pizza, good service. Two thumbs up will keep coming back. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is not my first time at a pizza place where super fast-fire'd pizza, that you have the option to customize on your own or select from one of their signature creations, which cooks in 180 seconds.  But what really stands out is the energy and friendliness of the hard working crew that works here, even on the day that the establishment is running a grand opening promotion where the pizza is free, and the drink too (if you download and sign up for their Blaze Pizza app).

In spite of the steady stream of customers that reminds me of all the people trying to make it through the the crosswalk at Shibuya (it is the world's busiest), to a lesser extent of course, the quality of customer service remained top notch. For a new place that have had a few day of soft opening experience under their belt, that is just impressive.

I opted to build my own pizza on my inaugural visit to Fast Fire'd Blaze Pizza, selecting mostly meat toppings (okay, all the meats except salami), plus red onions, roasted garlic, fresh basil and a sprinkle of oregano. 180 seconds later, it was ready for me to take back to my seat to enjoy. It was good, just a little salty due to the selection of toppings I have picked, but nothing a sip of their Blood Orange Lemonade couldn't remedy.

I would totally visit Fast Fire'd Blaze Pizza again. Hopefully the next few locations will be more centrally located, but seriously this location gives me one more reason to come all the way out to the Galleria Mall area.

Keep up the positive energy vibe Fast Fire'd Blaze Pizza and I will be back to earn a few more flames on the Blaze Pizza app for my free pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza parlor ever!!!! Love the low prices and that it's basically a subway for pizza! Workers are always very friendly, and extremely accommodating for anyone who has a gluten allergy like myself. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat of all time!!!"}
{"text":"Blaze is the best made to order affordable pizza in the yonge and Dundas area. When i last visited at lunch there was a lineup out the door with mostly Ryerson students.  Students love Pizza.  There are lots of great toppings to choose from to get the perfect pie."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for a $5 pie.  The hubby and went and grabbed what turned out to be a tasty fast pizza.   The menu us standard and the staff was most friendly navigating us through the process.  The sodas and teas were really good flavors and the pizza came out fast!  Was it the best pizza I have ever had?  No.  Was it the worst?  Not by a ling shot.   The crust is good thin crispy style and the sauce is rather tasty.  Excellent amount of cheese and some pepperoni made for a really good fast food pizza.  We were surprised.   Would I go without a coupon and pay $8-9?  Hell no but for a $5 fast pie it is pretty good.  It is a nice location and cool building and the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for an office from this location. Staff was super helpful and friendly. They were very accommodating as well as efficient. All the employees seemed legitimately happy to be at work. I had a great experience, and I will definitely be back!  I almost forgot to say the pizza was good!!!  The customer service was so awesome that I honestly wouldn't have cared, but I ordered the Green Stripe and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Very cool spot. You can build your own pizza and add as many ingredients as you want for around $7.40. Cheese only is $5. Good for kids. Pizzas are good tasting and the variety of ingredients is amazing good quality stuff too. Staff is very nice and friendly. Will def be back."}
{"text":"The first two people that helped me were rude They asked me if I've been here before and I said yes I've been  here before I begin to order my food and he said the next associate would help you and that's why I am offended! Rude people ...they didn't even cut my friends pizza she had to go back in to get it cut! We sat on the patio .."}
{"text":"I eat here all of the time. Only the best ingredients are used. Wonderful atmosphere. I don't even like getting food anywhere else now."}
{"text":"Used the app to order my pizza which was a breeze. As a plant-based dietician it was great they offered vegan cheese. Went to the establishment to pick up my pie and it was pleasantly waiting for me. #winning"}
{"text":"I have had some great pizza, but i have to say that this was the best pizza i have ever had. Ryan and his crew were absolutely phenominal. I would give ten stars but my option was five. I'll be back for more at Blaze. Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing! Crust is nice and crunchy and you can choose your own toppings. Incredible portion size for price point and I like how everything is easy, including the one price for any pizza. This would be a great spot for a group or work lunch considering you can get in and out in no time. The managers walk around to make sure that you have the pizza that makes you happy. All the staff were incredibly friendly with smiley faces. I would definitely return here again and this time I'll have a beer."}
{"text":"Quick, easy lunch and close to my office. I like that you pay one price for as many toppings as you can eat and that you can add as much cheese as you want."}
{"text":"Love this concept! Great prices and food is as good as you make it because you can customize your pizza and add toppings for no additional charge!! Pizzas are and around $8 and they taste great. Love that it's fast and affordable. Second time dining here and it's a new fav!"}
{"text":"Love the idea of the build your own pizza. The staff is finally getting it right and not automatically telling me what goes on it. Big improvement from the last couple of visits. Thank you Blaze Pizza staff."}
{"text":"My first time here.   The concept is you build your own pizza by adding more items.   I picked a meat eater pizza and added some veggies.   The first one the crust was screwed up and the remade it before even delivering it because it was not up to standards.   The second one came out missing onions, they added onions and started making a new one.   Lots of apologies and a few moments later they brought out the second pizza to go and a coupon for an additional return visit.    Honestly I was happy with just the added onions but they tried very hard to make it right.   The pizza was pretty good, but the customer service was awesome.   Anytime I see young kids running a place I am impressed.    I will return."}
{"text":"Pizza was really tasty, very customizable. Online order option is very handy. Aldo, I like seeing the pizzas being fired. However they forgot to make our order, I waited for 10min and asked about it. They gave us free drinks to apologize."}
{"text":"Would give it 5 but sometimes the deliciousness of the pizza just depends on who's manning the oven that day but the ingredients are super fresh and delicious !"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful for any yelpers that can't make up their mind about the type of pizza they want. I've been here a couple of times already and  everyone is really friendly as you move down the line to create your choice of pizza. 

The size of the personal pizza yields about 6 slices, so if you're really hungry then you can eat the whole thing. But if you're like me (sometimes I eat cute for lunch and pig out later) then you can have some now and have some later. Either way... It's good. 

There's no charge for any extra toppings and it's cooked in 180 seconds... So you really can't go wrong here. The only downside is parking. During the lunch rush, street parking can be a bit tricky. But it's not enough to keep me from showing up with a smile and an empty stomach."}
{"text":"UPDATE (As of 4/21)... it breaks my tummy's heart to have to remove a star from this location but they've officially deserved it. 

I went to meet a friend for lunch over the weekend (around 2:15pm) and was halfway greeted by a young lady writing the orders down. I used to be in customer service so I understand the \"I don't want to work today\" mood and was ok to just ignore, as she wasn't rude... she just wasn't polite. The line started to pick up a little with a family in front of us that had a specific preference for how their sauce was put on their pizzas. I'm guessing that this young lady was annoyed by the fact that she had to pitch in to help move orders along. After saucing my friend's pizza, she started on mine. I ordered a half White Top and half Green Stripe... for the green stripe side, I asked if she could put the spicy sauce on there...She didn't acknowledge that she heard me but proceeded to complain to another young lady, preparing the dough, by stating \"I hate when it gets busy, people get dumber...\" the other young lady looked hesitantly at us and the other customers that had started forming a line and tried to remain optimistic. The complaining individual then abruptly pushed my pizza down the line, put the toppings she knew to go on each side (didn't ask me anything) and went back to take orders with a heavy sigh and a very obvious eye roll! No ma'am... that is completely unacceptable on any level. If you believe that people are \"dumb\" for having a preference for their pizzas, from a place that encourage customers to HAVE A PREFERENCE... then you should have opted to make the dough and not talk to people at all. 

My friend and I enjoyed the weather so we decided to sit outside and chat a bit because it was getting loud inside with the lunch rush. As I was checking out I realized that a few of the people working in the oven area cared more about having a conversation then actually trying to get orders out. Again, I waved it off and enjoyed the outside weather and pizza. I ate the White Top side and noticed there were a few burned spots, but nothing that caused me any concern. I get the other half home to have later in the evening....but behold, it's burnt. So that's half of a pizza now in the trash because some individuals didn't want to take their weekend job seriously. 

I love Blaze, so while I haven't counted them out completely... It will be a long while before I try this location again!"}
{"text":"It's a cool place where you pick what you would like. My complaint is it is to loud in there."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night and it was quite busy with a long line up, and after I tried the pizza, I know why. 
You're able to add as many toppings as you like for the build your own pizza option. The toppings are fresh and you can add sauces at the end. It's basically a super yummy pizza for only $12 after tax. And i couldn't even finish the whole thing so I would even suggest sharing one between two people if you want a lighter dinner."}
{"text":"I know that they are still in the first stages of opening, but they seriously need to get more people working there (and train them). I understand that there is a learning curve with restaurants. My family has always worked in the industry and we had soft openings and learned what we were doing wrong. The people working here just seem to be reactive not proactive. The first time we went there, they re-fired our pizza 2 times. Came out burnt, but they re made and gave us a coupon for a free pizza. Totally understandable since they just opened. Now two weeks later...Our food took 40 mins AFTER we arrived to pick up our to go order. I thought the whole idea of this place was for it to be quicker than the competition??? The gluten free crust was like glue. The staff was complaining that the reason that our order was late was that other people who had ordered online hadn't picked up their pizzas...why is that our problem? I seriously hope they get their problems fixed...this is such a great concept in such a great area of town. The first time we had their pizza it was great (after they figured out the burning temperature). Come on guys...get it together!!!! You have a great concept and can kill it if you can deliver a good product in a timely manner...."}
{"text":"Another crazy parking lot with minimal parking for numerous stores.
I visited this location on a Friday around 1:15pm
The inside and outside areas were very crowded.  So loud  inside with echos that I did not dine in, not how I wanted to spend my lunch hour.
The employees were friendly and explained the concept of building the pizzas before I ordered.
$8.50
I modified one of their original pizzas.  Many toppings to choose from.  Hot out the oven, ingredients fresh, crust a little too thin for my taste (you could fold the whole pizza over easily), little greasy.
Requested water for my drink...here we go with the baby cups for water...geesh.  Just because I want water doesn't mean I will drink a toddler portion, I'm still an adult.
Good enough to return but not my first choice.  Same price for more food at local pizza shop."}
{"text":"I believe in second chances. I tried another Blaze pizza after having been extremely disappointed with the no cheese, veggie pizza I ordered the first time there a couple of weeks ago. This time they got it right - plenty of veggies and they prepared it with love!  It was very tasty. I wish I had taken a picture of the bare pizza I received two weeks ago to compare it to the one I got this evening. Night and day difference. One thing to note - my husband did have to ask for extra veggies.  Thank You to Blaze management for caring about customer feedback. It's good to know that owners are keeping up with what customers are saying about their product. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Good for when you're in a rush but to start off I should let you know I like crust so flatbread pizza is not my normal go to. I do like the idea of this and when you want it I suggest you eat it in-store and not to go as I find after gets even a little cool not as good. It's awesome that you can do the unlimited toppings and the pesto suace after cooking really brings it togather not my favorite but every now and then"}
{"text":"Fantastic vegan options!!  Pizza is so fun to have made and I loved picking out all of my fun vegan toppings and it was GOOD!  Great service and prices.   I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. I honestly can't get enough of this place and I always end up coming back when I'm in the area. For just above $10.00, you can get a pizza with as many toppings as you want made fresh in a few minutes. The employees are very friendly and energetic, and are always excited to explain the low down of how everything works. There's lots of hot sauce and additional spices to add to your pizza too, and there's two different sizes of to-go boxes in case you don't finish your pizza creation. 

The only downside is the lines - this place is always usually busy especially around the peak lunch and dinner times. The wait isn't usually that long but make sure you try and beat the rush!"}
