{"text":"I tried their hot stone bibimbap, and it was one of the worst I tried in Montreal. 
There was no \"hot\" in the hot stone bibimbap, so it wasn't really authentic in my opinion.  (I'm Korean so I know how Korean bibimbap should be done.) Was it just the time I visited? At Maru, the bibimbap was more vegetable oriented, which many people may appreciate and like, but I wasn't a huge fan. I wanted the traditional marinated beef in my bibimbap, but there was none, and instead there were lots of vegetables. It was alright, but I guess I was expecting beef."}
{"text":"Hey we just finished eating at a modest looking Resto but they serve amazing Korean food 
Best part is the chef 
He walks around we can talk to him and place the order after listening to how he will prepare the meal 
I had a wonderful silky tofu soup with seafood and a soft poached egg on top 
Hot and spicy and it really warmed us up 

Next were small tapas sized plated of fried kimchi ,sweet potatoes ,and a couple of other delicious delicacies 
And the main was super tasty beef ribs 
Mmmmm they are a treat 
The rice sides were pink colored and the taste was like eating rice with cotton candy 
Luckily we had room to Shaw a bowl of red bean ice cream 
And a few slices of fresh apples 
Great food and very moderate pricing 
Nice ambiance quiet and peaceful music 
Enjoy this place

{"text":"Delicious! Very authentic Korean cuisine. Friendly staff and great atmosphere. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"really nice interior- warm and cozy and family feeling. Pretty good for a drab building off the highway

Menu is good standard

very friendly staff

happy with the stirfry dish I got.  Extremely salty but enjoyed.  will go back hopefully a few times"}
{"text":"Maru is a welcome addition to the NDG area. The staff and service is friendly and quick without being too intrusive. I really liked the  soups here (budae jigae and soondubu jigae) though the pajeon I ordered was barely hot. The banchan are pretty good as well. i like dropping by after working out for a quiet lunch. t's a nice family owned restaurant I hope to see more of this summer."}
{"text":"Super tasty tteokbokki appetizer.
They need to make an main-sized version of it, I'd stuff my facehole with that on a regular basis.

The jeyuk bokkeum was good too, just not spicy enough for us.
But when we told our waiter he assured us that he will remember us & next time we visit it will be much spicier... Score! 

Oh and they have a terrace, so summery Korean food moments are an option."}
{"text":"Le soondubu joue bien l'équilibre des épices et la mesure du tofu. Le ragoût laisse une impression riche et réconfortante. Servi dans un marmiton, j'hésite à la hâte la première bouchée puisque le suc bouille toujours. À la fois soucieux, le serveur se veut aussi un peu gêné dans son approche. Charmant."}
{"text":"Can't believe Montreal have this good tasting Korean place. 
Passed by this place several times but finally deceived to try it after my friend recommended it. 
The exterior looked old and unwelcoming, but the interior was warm and clean. 
We ordered seafood tofu soup, kimchi pancake, beef stew, bibibum and raw tofu with sauce. Everything tasted so good. 
Definitely will come back if I was in mood for Korean.
Also, there service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Hwang Kum for authentic Korean food but decided to try Restaurant Maru with my family.  The food was very authentic and they serve up seconds for the kimchi entrees.  The seafood pancake was great (even though I'm not a fan of seafood).  I had the beef stew and it was very flavorful (a tad salty) but I took the rest home and stirred it in noodles and was totally awesome!  Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"I can't believe anyone would say it's a good place.  Anyone that says so does not know food at all.  Most horrible Korean food I have ever ate.

Service was the worst ever.  After ordering and waiting for food for 1 hour the waitress came back asking if we ordered.  She had forgotten.  At the end only 1 of 2 tofu soup arrived and we had to leave."}
