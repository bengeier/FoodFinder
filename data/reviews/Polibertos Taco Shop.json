{"text":"The food here was delicious. Very big servings, so it is cost-efficient . You can split the carne asada fries with 3 good appetites. (Guacamole!!) My bf got the tortas and they were amazing as well. For 15 bucks we got a huge lunch,  a decent dinner, and a soda. Not bad at all.

The dinning tables could have been kept a little cleaner, but bf said I was just being picky. Haha. I probably am. Regardless, when we stop over to Glendale Ave we will be making the trip to this little Mexican gem again."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and their menus with vegetables have always been not fresh. I got the 3 mini tacos, the tomatoes tasted like it's been sitting out and its not that fresh anymore. Don't get me started on the chips with sour cream and guacamole. The guacamole was horrendous. It tasted old and the guacamole was on the brown side. It seems like they don't use fresh produce at all. Never coming back here."}
{"text":"Addicted. Love the rolled tacos, my fav. Minus a star for drive through. Check your order before leaving the parking lot. It's fast and nobody's perfect. Go inside for free jalape√±o and carrots."}
{"text":"It wasn't to bad for a fast food place. I had the asada nachos. It was so filling I couldn't finish it all.  I feel it needed more than the sour cream, and guacamole it needed lettuce and tomatoes kinda to plain for my taste."}
{"text":"This place is my top neighborhood favorite. Great flavor in their meats and sides. You will really get your money's worth, can't go wrong with the carne asada fries."}
{"text":"They always put like 3 salsas in my bag, even when I ask for extra...no forks or napkins either, I hate when you have to ask for every little thing and they look like they're annoyed when you do. And me and my girlfriends stomachs are screwed up today, I don't think it's a coincidence."}
{"text":"The best! Tacos Mon/Tues/Wed is the best deal.  If you're around it stop in."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos ever!!! My husband and I go here often for them. They are very large burritos with lots of eggs, meat and cheese or however you like them. Im hungry now. Thanks"}
{"text":"This is a rich mans Taco Bell, great food, family owned I think and since you gotta wait a couple minutes I'm pretty sure at least some of the food is made to order. They have a fantastic carne asada steak burrito but I mostly get the carne asada nachos with all the melted cheese, guacamole, meat and chips. It's not fast food cheap for one person (I never pay under $7) but that's why I go to the Taco Bell down the steak when I want to be cheap, but these guys...'looks right and left'...they got the good stuff man."}
{"text":"Just purchased a Carne Asada Burrito with no pico de gallo (just guacamole and meat) and it's ridiculously good! Tastes fresh and homemade! Comfort food indeed! Usually the burrito comes with two little cups of salsa; I asked for extra and they gave me one more cup. I would understand if it were two of the medium cup sizes but they're not."}
{"text":"First reactions: limes behind the counter are obviously not from today it's 9am and they're brown. I watched an employee drop a whole sleeve worth of unwrapped cups on the floor and just pick them back up and stack them. The floor is sticky and there is trash and food on it. One other table seated so not like they're busy. Not looking good. 

normally I wouldn't eat anything given the cleanliness issues but I was sooo hungry I decided to risk it.   The food was ok and probably only that good because I'm so hungry.  Tortilla was stale and a bit hard. Carne asada was meh. 

All in all 2 for the food.  -2 for the cleanliness and another - for the employees. But since I can't give 0, they get a 1."}
{"text":"Best chorizo and egg burrito I've had in a while. They actually mix the egg and the chorizo instead of merely slapping sections of egg and chorizo into a tortilla. The flavor is great too. Can't wait to try more from this shop."}
{"text":"The chicken tacos are legit! The carne asada fries are the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Don't know how these people gave this place a 1 star, just because a mistake happened. I've been here several times now and you can't beat it for the money. I drive for Lyft at night so I go everywhere and eat at many restaurants. I'm giving it a 5 because I can't do a half star. But that's ok because there may be other places that are more modern but you pay for it. Poliberto's is a small restaurant where you get good food for a good price. It's one of my top picks for a drive through open 24/7 and beats most places especially for the money."}
{"text":"Really good fast Mexican food place good specials low prices recommended highly also really good daily specials"}
{"text":"Taco shop... hmmm, well the fish taco, Carne Asada and rolled tacos were dry and tasted like they were out of a can. No Bueno and approx price of 2.50 a piece didn't do them any justice.  Bland salsa.  Bland service.  I'd go to a few other places b4 ever going back."}
{"text":"I think so my best things here to eat our breakfast burritos.they also have really good specials throughout the week and you can't go wrong with her combo plates."}
{"text":"The Poliberto's burrito is handcrafted by official, undocumented immigrants, heiling from the land of the perfected burrito. They've spent centuries working on the burrito, and the product of that endeavor is that of Poliberto's."}
{"text":"I used to live on this side of town, and was over there, so decided to go to my favorote drive thru mexican joint.  I just love their chili rellano burritos, but this time there were so many seeds in the green chili that even after an extra strength heartburn pill, I'm still having issues.  That part is really hot, Polibertos, and easy to remove!  Take it out!  It would also help if the drive thru person spoke English.   West Phoenix is not Mexico."}
{"text":"Place stunk as soon as we walked in bathrooms were a mess and the carne asada tasted old and nasty the water was nasty. Halfway through my burrito my son spilled the red salsa all over my plate and im glad he did cause there was a bug in it I spit out what was in my mouth threw everything out and left. Im sure they must have had a bad night tonight but will not be going back."}
{"text":".99 tacos, chicken and beef, and other delicious specials on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Food is great, prepared well and great portions. Great seasonings and plenty of toppings and fillings. Great menu, good price, good service. Loved it! Thanks yelp for suggesting a great little find!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband have been here twice in 1 week. It's definitely a good place to come when nothing else is open the 3 mini tacos are great although a little on the expensive side compared to other taco  places. Their customer service is average really don't care to remember their customers. The restaurant itself is not dirty you will be able to eat inside without a problem. I think its a great place to get Mexican food when your hungry in the best is closed!"}
{"text":"Love the California burrito carne asada,potato,cheese, pico de gallo! Usually get 3 meals from it. Got my husband one but chunky chicken and rice instead of carne asada and potato. He loved it! Only drawback is the last three times in three weeks the prices keep going up Enough already please! I don't mind paying a tad more for good food but if the prices don't stabilize I may have to sadly look elsewhere! 1st week $6.25 2nd week $6.35 third week two burritos $14.92 see what I mean? And all the exact same California burrito. Great food but rising prices!"}
{"text":"Just so happened to be in the 'hood on Sunday afternoon, dropping my  oldest daughter off at a friend's house. 

Well, well, well, there's Poliberto's, and I have my partner in crime with me, my baby, closer to 11 now than 10 !  Here's my chance- I rarely order fries for myself unless I have \"someone\" to share them with.  Let's pull on in, shall we, for, ummm... dinner ruining snack?  Early dinner?  You decide, but we're gettin' some Carne Asada fries today!

O.M.G.

And my friends, I have moved my rating up to a 5.

My daughter opened them in the car.  We picked at them a little.  We liked.  

At the base of this massive mound of food are fries, cooked 'til crunchy.  They are seasoned well.  They are topped with a big ol' pile of cheese and massive quantities of carne asada.  Adding to the party, they are doused with sour cream and guacamole.  

She found the forks.  We picked at them some more.  We joked about not having any when we got home.  We talked about going back for another container.

I'd say we killed about 1/3 of these evil morsels by the time we got home."}
{"text":"My go to spot for authentic Mexican food 24/7!  I love the portions and the taste of all their food.  I always get a Chicken Quesadilla, #9 Enchilada Style or Chicken Nachos without the chips (Keto Diet).  They never mess it up and they already are quick!"}
{"text":"This was the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten. I took 2 bites and threw it in the trash! I think it was dog or cat and not chicken. The menus has no variety. So gross!"}
{"text":"Bought the big bowl o' refried beans and they ended up making friends with the hard shell T Bell taco and said, \"Hey! I just met you and this is crazy, but here's my number. So, call me maybe.\".......and call he did. #sacreligous? I think not. #nomnomnoms. ;) :p ;)"}
{"text":"This place has comE a long way since it 1st opened.  The food is good, the refried beans are good to. The prices are decent and they have great daily specials. if you're in the area you should give this place a try.....picture attached do not include update menu price."}
{"text":"I stop by this place for lunch based on the Yelp reviews it had. I ordered a Carnitas combination plate. The rice and beans were very good. The pork was Tough, dry, and flavorless. The guacamole was really runny and flavorless. I have an upset stomach now. I would never eat at this place again."}
{"text":"If I had to use 1 word to describe the food, I'd say \"sustenance\". I had the chicken burrito and the seasoning was non-existent, however the portion was rather large. The horchata taste like the cheap kind with a gritty texture. The service was friendly, which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1. I was starving so this was something to tide me over and that's it."}
{"text":"Thanks, Yelp!  I was in the area and looking for a good casual lunch spot. Polibertos came up in the app and had good reviews, so I gave it a try.  I was not disappointed - the carne asada tacos were great."}
{"text":"decided to try last night as the place was busy which is usually a good thing . I ordered  a beef taco and a green chili burro togo in the drive through.  The service was quick and the food looked good. I started with the taco which w√†s crispy using an in house fried shell but the shell tasted like the oil was old an! the dark color showed the same. It had a nice amount of shredded beef but lacked any flavor at all, even the supplied hot sauce could not make it better. It did look good. The burro was a good size and first bite had a nice green chile flavor with a lot of pork. It was tasty although very salty. I will try again in hopes this visit was just an off day."}
{"text":"Spoiler Alert: This place makes Filibertos look like Taco Bell.

In the West Valley, a name like \"Polibertos\" doesn't stand out. There are dozens of little taco shops out here, you can't drive more than a mile without seeing one. But this place is anything but generic. In fact, it's AMAZING!

Everything you order here is bigger than you expect for the low prices. If you get anything besides a simple taco or burrito, use the buddy system because you'll NEED help finishing the majority of meals on their menu.


My favorite dish on the menu is the carne asada fries. The meat is thoroughly seasoned, and the whole dish is smothered in guacamole and sour cream. I was excited to see the cook throwing on two freaking handfuls of shredded cheddar to make it all oh-so perfect. It's $8, making it one of the most expensive eats they have, but it takes TWO people to finish it, unless you're Adam Richmond or something. 

The place is always sparkling clean, it doesn't look shady, and the service is kind and quick. After I order, my food is usually out by the time I finish a game on the Ms. Pacman machine in the corner.

Best of all, the lobby (and drive thru!) is open 24 hours. So whether you're craving some chorizo for breakfast, or looking for a nice rich meal after a round of late night drinking, this is going to be your new spot. I extend my apologies to the countless competitors in the west valley--they've been outclassed."}
{"text":"Chili relleno burrito is a go. Bacon, egg, cheese and potatoe burrito is a weekly must have"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets - for cheap, fast, fresh and awesome Mexican food.  I always have to stop at this location for a breakfast burrito with no less than 5 cups of hot sauce and a horchata.  The burrito is enough to eat on for the whole day, but the horchata is gone too quickly.  The early morning staff are always friendly guys just waiting for an order.  I think they are a little tickled to see me (a tall non-Latin lady in business clothes) ordering a honking burrito with tons of hot sauce.  

So good.  So cheap.  I miss you Polibertos.  I want to open one in my area."}
{"text":"My mom lives near here and I stop by on occasion.  Mom gets chile rellano a lot with cheese enchiladas.  I love chips, salsa and the refried beans with cheese.  I love cheese enciladas too.  They are clean.  I've known places like this to taste/smell of PineSol.  Glad that this one does not.  Everything is flavorful and good.  I'll go back for more."}
{"text":"Get the carne asada fries. Now. Stop reading this. They are open 24 hours....you can make it.  They must weigh a pound or two...great for sharing. Good horchata."}
{"text":"Poliberto's
43rd & Glendale
Cost: $1
Service: 1 of 5, DISQUALIFIED BECAUSE WE GOT A BURRITO instead of a taco! 
Presentation: 3 of 5
Taste 1 of 5, \"not that great\" DISQUALIFIED BECAUSE WE GOT A BURRITO! Seriously?
In a taste test of 7 local taco shops, you failed to actually give us a taco the first time, and the tester wouldn't even eat the whole thing."}
{"text":"Hmm, I usually come here late now...like between 2 and 4am. Maybe one less than average food experience out of the last 10....and even that one wasn't bad. The rolled tacos here are really good and my favorite out of all Mexican food shacks in Phoenix. I think too many undercook their food but Polibertos gets it just right."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to the small Mexican restaurant. My husband and I like the quesadillas. I also really like the rice. Good for a quick inexpensive bite."}
