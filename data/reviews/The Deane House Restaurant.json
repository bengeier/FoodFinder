{"text":"IM IN LOVE!! New breaky place for sure. They really wow'd us with bringing us some scones and fruit while we waited for a breaky. Certainly the BEST french toast i have ever had in my entire life!! And their eggs benny so so so yummy!! THUMBS UP!!"}
{"text":"This is the place to bring your mother for brunch!  It has a great atmosphere overlooking the river, it is in a historical building, it gets busy but they take reservations on all days including the weekend so if you call the day before you will never wait. You can also request a special table with a view!  The menu is simple but pretty good. I've had the omelets, and the french toast. Both were excellent. The best part is that you get homemade fresh biscuits and jam along with fruit with every entree. So it is a really good value - that your mom would appreciate! Oh and the coffee is really good. Outstanding; coffee shop worthy in fact.  They take reservations so there is no wait on the weekend. Yes I'm repeating that...but where can you go on a Sunday for brunch and not wait? Seriously take your Mother out here. It will make her day. It is just that kind of place..."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Went for brunch in Inglewood, and couldn't find anyplace to go.  Never even thought of the Dean house.   Brunch was coffee, a fruit bowl, bread, and eggs Benedict. It was all delicious, and in a unique historic setting.   Everyone must visit!"}
{"text":"We attended a murder mystery done by Pegasus at the Deane House this past Valentine's day.   For $75 pp you get a 4 course meal and murder mystery.  That cost includes gratuities but not tax.   The play itself was well done - even though it was a murder mystery it was also very much a comedy and there were lots of laughs to be had.   They made an effort to make it very valentine's day themed even though it was their running play of the moment which was special.  They had valentine's chocolates sitting at the place when you arrive and they brought a bonus dessert of chocolate covered strawberries out at the end.   Dinner consisted of a soup (split pea) with a scone, salad (with beet and pistachio), main entree (beef, chicken fish... but I special ordered a veggie dish is advance which was cannelloni with mashed potatoes and veggies) and creme brulee for dessert with coffee service.     All servings were great (some I would never have ordered al carte because I wouldn't have thought I'd like them but I still did).  They attempt to use as many local ingredients as possible and it shows.  Food is kind of like a nice meal made after a farmers market trip.  Yum.    The only thing that left me wanting was a better wine list.   Wines were all low end bottles (with a hefty for what it was price tag).  I ordered some anyway but I didn't really like it ... next time I'd go with a cocktail and hope they have a good bartender.  A wonderful evening.  Although with the show starting at 7 and lasting a few hours,  the entree wasn't served until quite late and I was very hungry by the time it arrived.  When we go again I'll make sure to have a late lunch or something to tide me over for the late dinner.  HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"Went to see a murder-mystery dinner theater last Friday. Very good. Actors were engaging and funny, interacted with the entire audience. Service was spot-on, and for close to four hours we were entertained, fed appetizer of pumpkin & pear puree, entree of beef tenderloin on mash potatoes and tender root vegetables. Dessert was some sort of an apple muffin, with a nice creamy topping. Food, coffee, entertainment cost $ 75.00 per ticket, includes taxes and gratuity.   Fair value for your buck. I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"The Deane House on 9th avenue S.E. sits very pretty alongside the Elbow River and has been on my list of places to visit for months, finally the other day I ventured over for lunch, only to find that this house also has tons of history.  Nearly 100 years old the Victorian house was home to the first RCMP in Calgary and is also part of Fort Calgary's Interpretive Center.  The Deane house offers brunch and lunch which consists of salads, pasta dishes and steak but for $25 you can also have a lunch menu of 4 courses which I believe changes every day.  You have the option of sitting indoors and looking at the river from the window or sitting near the garden, so my friend and I opted to sit in the backyard near the garden.  The home is quite quaint and there were many passersby that day which made the meal even more enjoyable.  Many wild ducks and geese are known to come from the shores of the Elbow River to take advantages of the wonderful crabapples that fall from the trees just in front of the house.  The waitress was very friendly and it wasn't long before we received our meals.  The cheeseburger there which according to the waitress is the best burger she has ever had in her life is I must admit quite up there in ranks for me as well.  The beef is grade A and it is garnished withe usual toppings but flourished with sun dried tomatoes and the option of a baked potato or potato wedges.  Delicious!  The Deane House is also home to local theatre companies who  perform \"Mystery Dinners\" where clients take part in staged murders that happen during the meal.  I was quite intrigued by this until my friend informed me that the Deane House is also well known as being a place of strange happenings, its haunted reputation is well visited by patrons because of this.  I thought it was a joke until we walked back to my car in the parking lot and I could swear I saw the curtain move upstairs.  I will definitely visit again during Halloween.  Moo HaHa"}
{"text":"This is one my favorite brunch spots in Calgary. Please don't all rush out, I'd still like to get a table.  Here is why this place is awesome: 1. Great views of the river while you eat and the garden as you walk through from the parking lot. 2. The servers are incredibly kind. They get to know you and they are always on the ball. 3. The price is fabulous. Brunch begins with homemade warm scones (awesome) and a bowl of fruit, in addition to your meal. 4. You're right in Inglewood, you can walk by the river, check out Fort Calgary or enjoy the fantastic shops of Inglewood after your meal. 5. The Deane House is beautiful. You are welcome to look around. 6. It's family friendly. My grandparents feel welcome there, children eat there. Families are welcome. 7. There are spaces for groups. Enjoy your next baby shower there :) 8. Food is excellent!! 9. I've never had to wait for a table and I usually go on Sunday's during prime brunch hours.  Ok, make a reservation if it's a holiday like Mother's Day, and be prepared that they might have a set menu that day.  They take debit tableside. No cost for parking, though their parking lot can be a bit small. They are open year round :)"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to get in a visit to the Deane's House for brunch. Sure glad I thought of it this weekend! It'll be closed as of August 1st for some fairly major overhauls... Or \"extensive renovations\" as the website says. Essentially, you've got 2 more days to go try it in all its current glory!  Brunch time, you've got 8 options: the good old Captain's Breakfast, 3 versions of eggs Benny, build your own omelette, brioche French toast, blueberry pancakes or sirloin steak and eggs. If you're ordering brunch, it already comes with scones and home made jam, though I'd so just make a meal out of an order of them and nothing else!  I opted for the traditional eggs Benedict. Done right! I took way too much pleasure in watching the egg yolk ooze out as I sliced into the middle.  Our server was also awesome, my coffee cup never went empty... Or cold!  All in all, just under $35 for two of us for a delicious brunch in a great \"old school\" kind of environment! Who wants to go with me once more tomorrow?"}
{"text":"I was recently at the Deane House with a group of friends on a sunny April morning in Calgary. It was a fine Calgary spring day, at least, as fine as can get in our city. The streets were dirty, the sidewalks covered in gravel, and the landscape as grey as my grandmother's back. Unseemly. Yet, my friends, spring was in the air.   The Deane House is in one of the most gorgeous spots in the city., a few hundred metres from the Bow River, and is also one of the few heritage buildings in this city of bulldozers, and glass towers. Monstrosities!  Speaking of the purported monstrosities housed in the Deane House, I have never been fondled or groped. Not by the dead, anyway. The Deane House holds no paranormal interest for me.  However, I was interested in brunch. I am always interested in brunch, and because, like all Calgarians, I don't actually know anything about Calgary, we decided to visit this old landmark.   It's a neat place. I actually used the word \"neat\" when we were brought to our table on the closed-in, wrap-around veranda. Speaking of that, I love wrap-around verandas, and someday, when I have a rocking chair, I want a veranda to place it upon.  The menu is small, and standard. You've got your Captain's Breakfast, which Captain Peter ordered. That's bacon or sausage, two eggs, two uhhh toasts, and home fries.. There's french toast, eggs benedict, pancakes, a \"do-it-yourself\" omelet etc... We know the drill, folks.  The coffee was good, the breakfast was good. Everything was good. What more do you want from a brunch place? I wanted scones. I pronounce them schones, I don't know why. I didn't know I wanted fruit salad, but I got it with my entree, and I enjoyed it. The coffee was strong, not as strong as I like it, but weak breakfast coffee seems to be a Calgary hallmark, akin to the \"white hat.\"  And that my dear yelpers is why the Deane House gets 4 stars. Can a brunch place get more than 4 stars? I say, no. Brunch is too standard, too hard to mess up, and too easily over-priced in this city. The Deane House was a standard, regularly priced brunch place with some beautiful views."}
{"text":"I had an experience with a ghost.  I speak no lie.  I initially went to Deane House for an evening of dinner and an interactive murder mystery... and because I'd heard that it was haunted.  Well, people were right.  Let me tell you how it all went down.  It was a dark and stormy night... okay, just kidding.  It's kind of like any other dinner theatre, but a little more personal.  Everyone is seated in different parts of the downstairs of a house and the actors actually move in and around you as they perform their mysteries.  It's literally like watching a game of Clue.  It was so neat and definitely different than anything I'd experienced before.   The food was neither good nor bad.  It was exactly as I expected it.  What I wasn't expecting was that the actors were waiters as well.  It was cool the way they stayed in character the whole time.  Finally, the best part... that haunting.  Okay, so it was nearing the end of the show and I was beginning to doubt anything paranormal was going to happen to me.  My Mom and I went upstairs to go to the bathroom and that's where it happened.    I had finished using the facilities before my Mom so took a seat on one of the chairs in the ladies room.  I hadn't been sitting for more than a few seconds when I looked over at the chair next to me and noticed that the cushion was slowly deflating into what seemed like a bum print.  I pointed it out to my Mom and we were both kind of freaked out.  As soon as I stood to leave with her, the cushion on the chair beside me began to rise back up again.    At this point in time my Mom and I are totally freaking out!  We immediately rushed to the bathroom door to get the hell out of there, but found ourselves unable to open the door.  It was as if someone was on the other side of the door, holding it shut.  It moved just slightly away from the frame but wouldn't pull all the way open.    By now us freaking out has turned into shear panic when suddenly the door opened and we were able to leave.  We immediately looked around to see who was near us that could have been holding the door, but saw no one.  As soon as you leave the bathroom there is a long staircase, so we would have seen someone.  There also weren't any other doors that someone could have ducked into.    So, what do we think?  To this day, my Mother and I still believe that we had an encounter with a ghost.  It was the scariest, coolest thing that ever happened to me!  I signed the guest book with \"I had an encounter with a ghost\" and I will swear to that to this day!"}
{"text":"Yesterday afternoon my husband and I decided to go to the Deane House for the first time in over 2 years. Immediately they were so courteous with seating us and asking if there'sanything we'd like. My husband ordered the $25 Big Taste of Calgary meal which he enjoyed, plus I think it's great that the Deane House supports that event. Even though I ordered the least expensive menu item, I found there was a lot to it. Since it was a brunch, I also recieved a fruit bowl and a basket of scones, which were really good. In addition to the excellent attentive service and filling food, I found the Deane House to be very visually appealing as well. At the front it is very well-kept and authentic, and the tables were perfectly set complete with flower arrangements. It was a lot like being at a cozy bed & breakfast :)"}
