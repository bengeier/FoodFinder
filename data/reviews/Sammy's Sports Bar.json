{"text":"Wait what?

I had a solid vegan meal. . .at a casino bar. 

Wasn't expecting much of Sammy's but joined some friends to watch the Ultimate Fighter finals there anyway. Ordered the mixed veggies with tofu with a side of steamed rice, which the waitress offered to swap for coconut at no cost. It was your typical Canadian style Chinese food, but without the msg attack afterwards or a pile of grease as sauce. The portion shouldn't have been surprising, being a casino, but it was at least two meals for me. I was pretty happy with my $10 find. 

Service was great. I never noticed my glass go empty and the waitress didn't give us attitude about not ordering alcohol. Overall, a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Sammy's is a small sports bar, as is their menu, which is my beef.  I was excited to eat in a bar because it doesn't happen very often and then upon opening the menu, I discovered there are only 8 menu options.  Seriously?!  They don't even list a side of fries, which I would have preferred to anything else on the menu.  Wonton soup?  Really?  Bizarre.  I ended up trying their boneless pork ribs and they were pretty bad.  Flavorless, really.  Kind of chewy.  There wasn't anything healthy available (i.e. veggies and dip, salad).

The drink prices were fine and the service was acceptable.  I just know better not to go here if I'm in need of food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, went for a quick meal before the game, i ordered a won ton soup which i normally would love unfortunately the menu never mentions that there would be shrimp or squid in it. After finding squid in the bowl i asked the waitress about it and her best answer was oops i guess i should have told you about that are you allergic. This is extremely wrong if i would have been i would've probably died with all those shrimps and squid. I was unable to continue eating my meal since i do not eat sea food, it was extremely disappointing"}
