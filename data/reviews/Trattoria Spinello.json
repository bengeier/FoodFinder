{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go to Spinello's now! I am so impressed by this place, I am writing this review mid meal - I'm in the restaurant right now. I try to eat light at dinner, but once I walked in and saw the food on some of the plates, I knew this was going to be a cheat night! The service by Frank and Chef Amato was amazing. The atmosphere is great if you're by yourself or with a group. The hand made bread is exceptional. I'm only in town for a day, but if I was a local, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance, great food and a chef who prides himself on the freshness of his food. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Decided to dine here for dinner one night and was so blown away by our experience. 

We shared a calamari appetizer and were really pleased with our pick. Everyone at our table had a pasta dish and it was superb. Good portions and great quality, it tasted fresh and made to order. No dessert for us since we were so full, but hopefully next time we'll be able to indulge. 

The restaurant looks like it can accommodate large groups easily. However, the location does seem to be a little tucked away. I hope that this doesn't do them any disservice since it would be easy to overlook this place. The service was spot on, and we really enjoyed that we got a chance to talk to the chef. That made our dining experience all the better. 

Will definitely be back to dine here!"}
{"text":"Great Italian place, Frank was extremely pleasant and the chef was great to talk with after our meal. Truly a great place to visit while in town."}
{"text":"If you like your food fresh and cooked to perfection, this is the place to go. Friendly owner and chef go out of their way to make it feel like home.  Our group had a great experience."}
{"text":"Somehow we wound up at a Best Western outside of Toronto, desperately seeking a good restaurant to lift my spirits. Thanks to Yelp we found just the place  Absolutely loved the decor and the meal was fabulous. The owner/chef came out to sit with us and to create a special meal for us. We started with the mushroom salad which was great. My friend had a wonderful lamb ragout &, lamb ribs served with pasta.  I had veal pizziola with vegetables and potatoes.  Both excellent choices. Too bad it's so far from home."}
{"text":"Just had a great dinner with my family on the way to Muskoka.  The trout special was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The pastas were fresh and also perfectly cooked.  Equally impressive was the service.  The owner runs the front of the house and is all over every detail.  As a result the service was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  This is a casual, laid-back place that is perfect for families.   My bill could have been 30% higher and I would have been equally happy, so this place is a heck of a bargain on top of it all."}
{"text":"No menu offered to start which was a bit strange but the server explained that patrons usually stop at the daily specials. 

We did the same and we're not disappointed! Amazing mussels. Being a while back I can't remember what else we ordered, but everything from the bread to the wine and of course the food was delicious. Don't be turned off if the place is unusually empty ;) very good dinner."}
{"text":"Totally outstanding restaurant! My friend and I are foodies...we can't say enough about the great taste of the dishes we had at Spinello's. Pasta and veal. Even the Caesar salad was the  best I've ever tasted. Service was top notch.  You know often when  the chef comes and chats with the customers, he's proud and knows he's done a praise worthy job. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant a half star, if I could.
Service was absolutely terrible! We went for an 80th birthday party and it started off great. Owner was very pushy and I wouldn't be surprised if he took left over wine and put it back in the bottle for new customers !! We had paid for unlimited wine and when we asked for more, he told us that wine was for dinner and dinner was over, so he took our glasses away.
I asked my boyfriend to get me an Americano, and he told him this is not Starbucks !! We had fruit and when we asked for plates and forks, he handed me a stack of napkins and said \" here use this, I don't have any plates \". After our main dish, water was never restocked on the tables. 
Overall, we felt like we were being rushed because he wanted to go home. 

There are many great Italian restaurants in Woodbridge and this is not one of them !!! Try any other place and you will enjoy your evening with your loved ones."}
{"text":"Frank(owner) and Adrianna were awesome. Brings back memories of Italy.
No rush, everything fresh and cut by hand. Even when the place gets busy they have time and care about your experience."}
{"text":"We very much enjoyed three lunches in a row at Spinello while attending business meetings across the street from their establishment.  The food quality is exceptional and the service is very very high.  Personal.   I would recommend this place for just about anyone looking for quality food in this area.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town for business.  Great job guys.

Ps.  The Salmon was awesome!

{"text":"Definitely one of the best meals I've had in a while! The chef was able to come out and greet us, spoke to us about the specials of the day which made it a much more personable and special experience. 

My friends and I shared the mussels which were delicious (tomato base with a hint of spice) and quite large. One friend had the sausage and rapini (I think) pasta which was fresh and delicious. A second friend had a steak with some vegetables which was also good. I had a veal dish which was unbelievable! So incredibly juicy, full of flavour and tender. The wine we shared was fantastic (unfortunately I have forgotten the name but it was a mix of cabernet and merlot). 

Definitely would come back here again, the food was fantastic, the staff were incredibly nice and inviting, the ambiance was wonderful and comfortable."}
{"text":"Unpleasant and awkward experience! The waitress showed serious attitude because I had to send my uncooked salmon back to be cooked more. She said usually people eat salmon pink. She got mad and started smashing and throwing dishes around making a bad scene. She then got yelled at by the chef. Thanks for an awkward and embarrassing evening."}
{"text":"Exceptional service!  Food is extremely good (reminds me of local Roma trattoria!), Fresh homemade pasta and fresh seafood.  The Steak cooks perfectly.  Love the personal touch by the head chef!  Frank the owner is extremely friendly.  Definitely a MUST TRY! I'll be Back Spinello!"}
{"text":"We planned a friend's birthday party at Spinello this weekend and were disappointed. The food and atmosphere were good (though not as great as all the positive reviews below would suggest), but mainly it was our experience of the service was unfortunate. 

Like some of the other reviewers, we were told a large party of 12 was no problem, but upon arriving, were informed by the owner that we couldn't order off the menu, and had to choose from a short list of items he rhymed off for us. Apparently, although we were 1 of only 3 groups in the restaurant, the kitchen wouldn't accommodate us ordering as we pleased. Having mainly come for the pizza, we were disappointed (as this was apparently not an option.) The website had also indicated that gluten-free pasta was available, which was not available when we arrived (having two GF diners in our group, this was inconvenient.) 

Rather than allowing us to pick individual appetizer items to order, the owner convinced us to allow him to bring a slew of antipasto to the table (which ended up being very expensive.) 

We received two wrong menu items (a meat dish for a vegetarian and a pasta dish for a child that the parents didn't order) and were charged for both. In both cases, either the chef or the owner came to the table not to apologize, but to somewhat angrily let us know that it was somehow our fault. It was embarrassing and unnecessary, given that they had made the mistakes.

Overall, I would say that the food at Spinello is good, but for large parties, the service is poor and the prices are steep. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great meal, great service and fantastic atmosphere!! Very nice place with homemade pasta and very intriguing specials. Best veal chop my dad has ever had, and I enjoyed the seafood pasta! From out of town and trying to figure out a time to come back!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Savour York Region restaurant week a crowd of yelpers and I got to experience the joy that is Spinello. Opening only this past December, Spinello Vaughan is actually V 2.0! 

For those following the Toronto food scene since the mid 90's you would know that Spinello actually successfully ran in the city from 1993/4 until it closed its doors in 2006. 

While I never visited the original location I can say that Spinello Vaughan is a dose of upscale Toronto in the heart of suburbs. Built into what was formally a nightclub co-owners and partners Frank and Wayne have transformed what was once cold and clubby into something warm and inviting. 

I won't go into too much detail on the decor because my descriptions simply won't do this place justice. I also don't want to ruin the \"wow\" factor we all experienced when first walking in! A couple of highlights however would be: the custom made wine rack/wall, the warm colour scheme, the private dining lounge upstairs (yes an upstairs open to below), and the aged wood used to decorate much of the interior (taken from a barn piece by piece and installed by the owners themselves). 

Enough about my love for this places looks, lets talk about their awe inspiring food! I will note that we had a specialty dinner organized based off the Savour York Region menu they were already offering (with a couple yelp-exclusive additions available only this evening - but everything we had was available on the menu). 

To begin we had an...

Amuse Bouche - two circular slices of a crepe filled with a mix of Gorgonzola and ricotta cheese, set on top of bed of roasted red pepper and tomato sauce. Exquisite!

Followed by an appetizer of...

Mushroom Salad - Hot mixed mushroom salad served with balsamic reduction demi glaze on bed of mixed greens. This had everyone at the table moaning. Begging for more! 

For a mid course the chef then prepared a special...

Lobster Spaghetti - perfectly cooked chunks of lobster done in an olive oil and brandy sauce. Had a flavour that we all described as a smokey (a flavour illusion caused by the reduced brandy). 

The main to follow was a...

Veal Marsala - served on a 1/2 roasted red pepper stuffed with mashed potatoes on a bed of red cabbage. This was a spin on the traditional Marsala with a richer sauce and garnish that made me drool at the sight of it.

And just when you thought we couldn't eat anymore...

A dessert course of Tiramisu and espresso. I'm NOT a dessert fan as heavy creams and sugars upset my stomach. But this creamy, rich and light slice of heaven worked miracles on my tummy and my taste buds. What i enjoyed most was that there was only a hint of espresso flavour in the cake. It didn't overwhelm the dish. Amazing!

Each course was expertly cooked and not one person had a complaint or a negative thing to say about the meal. One of the best things is their portion sizes. They don't skimp for a second. Even on things like fish courses, they do one of the healthiest portion sizes I've seen. Simply incredible. Very Italian. 

I can't say enough great things about Spinello, I was floored by every aspect of this place (decor, service, food, everything). What I will say is that I finally have an answer to the following question I get asked as a Yelp Community Manager of Italian background:

\"Hey Kris, where is the best place for Italian food?\"

Now you know.

Eatcrest Out,"}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite places to eat is Spinello. My kids are always happy when we're at Spinello. Their kids menu, while simple in adult eyes, is perfect for children. My husband and I can always find a good meal too. The portion sizes are so large that we rarely, if ever walk out without a doggie bag. If there is any Italian restaurant that I would recommend in Ontario, it would be Spinello.  If I could steal the recipes from the head chef I would. BTW, my favorites there are mussels and veal piallard... I have been there many times and the food is always excellent, the portions are spectacular, the service is very friendly - though, I am yet to see bad service in Italian restaurant - yes, I am married to Italian :)"}
{"text":"Amazing! Really made us feel welcome and loved as soon as we walked in. A lot of places just want you to come in a pay them for food. Here you really get a sense that you are guests and your host will make sure you are taken care of. Not to mention how great the food was! Everything was amazing and nothing short of wonderful. My girlfriend kept saying she felt like she was back in Italy. The owners served us and chatted with us. The chef came out to check how the food was after every dish and talked to us about his home in Italy. This restaurant may not look like much from the street but it is a diamond."}
{"text":"Just left this incredible restaurant and couldn't wait to write a review!! My friends had been raving about this place, so I had high expectations when we came in. We were completely blown away. The owner and staff are so incredibly warm and friendly -- we felt immediately at home. It was so nice. 

It would be hard to describe how good the food is. You can tell the chef cooks with passion; the flavours are delicious and the portions are very generous! 

Our special requests (bruschetta pizza & gnocchi) were completely and utterly satisfied -- we couldn't be happier. 

Last but not least, we were celebrating a birthday and the owner made it so much special by introducing us to the yummiest tiramisu. 

Highly recommend this place!!! Big thanks for making our evening delicious and fun."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!  Excellent dinner and top service.  Tasty calamari and shrimp to start.  Amazing Taglitelli with bacon and sausage as pasta course, phenomenal veal chop and salad as main course, and tiramisu for dessert.  Fantastic wines too.  Want a real taste of Italy; come here!"}
{"text":"A little off the beatin path, this is a hidden gem.  Moved here a few years back from downtown, bring a good reputation.  

The owner is hands on with the kitchen and dining area, allowing for a welcoming service.  Small but covered menu.  Always interesting specials.

A restaurant I frequent."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. The owner Frank came out to greet us...no menu required!!! 6 course meal, chefs favorite. Wine was awesome, food is top 3 I have ever had and I have had 5 star food all over the world. I cannot put into words how important it is for you to come to this place. Location is secluded but go in, grab a seat and get ready for an incredible experience! What a culinary joy!!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous. The service (Adriana) was amazing, they kept close tabs on the table & never missed a thing. The specials were described beautifully & even though she had multiple tables, she never made us feel rushed & even had light conversation. Hubs had the calimari, it was fresh, followed by the grilled trout & a Caesar salad. The fish was really good, grilled perfectly & served simply. Perfect. He said the dressing tasted homemade & that isn't surprising, you can tell they all take pride in their food, service, and business. I had the gnocchi in a cream tomato sauce & had to have a spoon so I didn't miss a bite of that sauce (I could've eaten the sauce as a soup). We're only in town for a few more days, but we'll go back before we leave. It's a gem."}
{"text":"Went once in the winter it was great so we went again with friends and we were so embarrassed.  No menu, didn't have food we asked for once we got the menu. Last weekend my girlfriend went to celebrate mothersaday with family and once again no menu asked for pizza and they told her their kitchen wasn't big enough to make pizza. We got pizza when we went .  They then ordered steak and they had no steak. The restaurant was empty. If your restaurant cannot provide the food choices and or service for good paying customers I think it is unfair to impact their experience and embarrass them with the guests they have brought due to your unfortunate circumstances. Perhaps you need to revisit your business model. We won't be back good luck I do hope it turns around for you."}
{"text":"We came there for our annual team event. They served great food, can't be better, it's the best food."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and Adriana and Frank are super friendly.  Started with focaccia and oil and balsamic on the house. House red was sweet and wonderful. I had the veal and it was tender and full of flavor. Came with potatoes and veggies. Delicious. Todd had the lamb ragu and the pasta sauce was simple and full of flavor. The lamd was tender and delish too. The fettuccini noodles were perfectly done."}
{"text":"First class treatment on a rainy night a little off the beaten path.  Frank (owner) provided top notch hospitality/conversation and matched it with a perfectly balanced meal.  Lamb ragu with tagliatelle pasta.  Thin seared veal with al dente vegetables.  Espresso with lemon gelato and biscotti to finish.  Great people.  Great food.  Visit.  Consume.  Smile.  Repeat."}
{"text":"I came here with friends and family on New Year's Eve. Location is relatively central and easy to find. Decor is rustic but sleek. The menu has some nice variety. Wine selection was decent. Service was attentive and personable. Most importantly, the food was fresh, extremely tasty and perfectly executed. Given that the restaurant is still in its infancy, and given that it's being run by a well-seasoned veteran, I imagine the whole experience will only get better with time!!!

Only because 4 1/2 stars is not an option, I must point out that I give the food (which is what is critical to me) 5 BIG stars!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Spinello's recently with a large party and was incredibly unimpressed with the service. The food was fairly good, but the entire experience was fairly negative due to our interaction with the manager and chef.

For one thing, they were very rude and not at all accommodating of dietary needs. (For example, gluten-free options that are listed on their online menu were not available when we arrived.) 

We came with a group of 10 and were told that was too many to order off the regular menu. We had made reservations ahead of time and were not informed of this until we arrived. It made ordering complicated for our group with very diverse eating needs.

Overall, while the food was good, I would not recommend this restaurant for parties or large groups."}
{"text":"Today was my birthday and I had decided to try something new with my hubby. Thanks to the other yelpers recommendation, I've decided to try this place. 

Went in there at around 3 pm (late lunch) lights were all turned off (but we had lots of natural sunlights) and we were the only couple dining-in at that time.

The chef came out to greet us and asked what we wanted to eat. We were both surprised that the chef said he can make anything we want to eat. 


We ordered: 

The fried calamari (tasted so fresh and the homemade Caesar dip that came with it was wonderful and something new to try!) $14.00 (decent) 

Between Medium-rare to medium Steak with veggies (okay, seriously... I'm still thinking about it! THE BEST STEAK IVE EVER HAD! Cooked perfectly to the way I want it!) $21.00 for 8oz top Angus steak.  (Tbh this is by far the best steak and price I've ever  had and seen. Way better the the keg...

Chicken pasta (forgot what the sauce were but it was really yummy! The portion was huge! My hubby loved it's!) 

They offered me a free sliced of birthday cake (owner and chef sang me the birthday song:] ) all gone within second. let me tell you, at this point both hubby and I were so full because we finished eating everything because it was that good! My hubby doesn't eat dessert said it was really good! 

We got fresh-baked garlic bread (I told the chef it was so good and he gave me some to bring home without charging me... Seriously this is the first time I've been to a restaurant that had such friendly, welcoming and unique services) I will be back soon! Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Was greeted at the door. What a great place!!! So personal and romantic. The chef came out and talked to us for a long time it set such a great tone for our group.
Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  The ambience is not great. It feels like you are eating in a strip mall location.  The owner was doing his accounting at a table which was distracting.  The wine selection is quite poor and what they offer is not very good for the money.  The service was OK..  When we complained about the wine, we were told that there would be a reduction in price but that never materialized."}
{"text":"For the Taste of Vaughan, I joined a few of my Yelp friends for dinner at Spinello's.  For a 3 course meal the special price was $25.00.  The owners went above and beyond what was offered on the menu for us that evening. The service was great, staff were friendly and the restaurant itself had a very relaxing nuvo feeling. The chef gave us a delicious appitizer called a \"mouze bouche\".  Our next course was either soup or salads.  I opt for the warm mushroom salad....... my mouth is still watering over the taste. The chef surprise .... seafood pasta mmmmm! delicious.  This I followed with Veal Marsala, my husband had the sea bass both were fabulous flavour and presentation wise.  Just when I thought I couldn't eat more we were presented with tira masu and coffee. Now I always thought noone can make a tiramasu like mine well I have to say this was a close second.  We literally all rolled out of the restaurant feeling overly satisfied. Oh! did I mention they have a nice selection of wines.  Highly recommend you take advantage of the Taste of Vaughan special menu.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Definitely will go back for more!"}
{"text":"Visited tonight and had a tremendous dinner.  The owner and all the staff were equally as tremendous.  Wonderful food and atmosphere, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome!  The owner, the chef, the waiter and especially the food were all TOP NOTCH!!  We very much recommend and hope you enjoy as much as we did.  The people of Vaughan are very lucky to have such a great place close by!"}
{"text":"If not for Savour York Region, I would never experience Spinello and doesn't realize what I have been missing.

Dinner Menu for $25 is definitely a steal.

Mushroom Salad
- Love the Shaved Parmesan Cheese and of course I am a fan of mushroom

Fish Feature of the Day
- Perfectly grilled fish so light and flaky and the pesto sauce enhance the flavours make this a really balance dish

Tiramisu
- Not the traditional version and I found it taste more like a cake

Wine Selection here is excellent. The staff here are really knowledgeable and able to help you in making recommendation.

Love the House Red!"}
{"text":"Okay, I went here because of some friends have told me that this place is great.

I ordered just the pasta because carbs are my kryptonite when it comes to attempting to eat a lot. The food did not taste store-bought at all, fresh ingredients at a fair price. I wish I could have tried more dishes on the menu because they all look good, but oh so filling. I find that every Italian place, especially in Vaughan, have been kind of the same, but Trattoria really takes the cake as probably the best one!

Decor was nice, and the wait staff were incredibly nice! I usually tip depending on how often they visit my table and let's just say that this waitress got a nice tip at the end of the meal.

Would love to go again! I do recommend this place, and attempt to battle the carbs ;)"}
{"text":"Tonight I left this restaurant feeling horrible due to the experience I had with the waitress which I believe was the owner. She refused to give us the menu as she demanded that we pick from her list of foods which they didn't have. I had to tell her that I am visual therefore would like to see a menu. After 10 minutes of placing our order she came back just to tell us she didn't have those dishes so we changed it to another thing. Again after another 15 minutes she came back to let us know she didn't have those dishes either and forced us to pick something we didn't want. This was her way of keeping us all there but then letting us know that they didn't even have those dishes. If you can't make those dishes why are you advertising is? 
When the food came it was uncooked. One salmon was completely raw and the other was fully burnt and turned over thinking I wouldn't notice that it's burnt. When we called her over to ask them to cook the salmon more she was upset that we are doing that and not a single apology came out of her mouth. She proceeded to tell us that we are wrong and that's how salmon needs to be. She never once checked up on us or gave us water. She was yelling at another staff and using very bad language in front of all of the customers with children around as well.This has been the absolute worst experience and I will never go here again. Not only did I waste my time but also wasted my money too."}
{"text":"In town on business, decided to give this place a try based on the reviews on yelp. All the food was fresh and delicious, absolutely top notch. I will definitely be returning and suggest others give it a try."}
{"text":"Very good Italian restaurant in the suburbs.  The location is a bit out of the way, but if you are willing to make a small effort, you will get a good reward.

On the chef's recommendation, I had the Osso Buco with gnocchi.  The veal was good, the sauce was better, and the gnocchi was the best I've ever had.  Fresh, a bit cheesy, and not at all the typical rubbery or mushy substance of other Italian places."}
{"text":"A hidden gem for Italian food! A heads-up: No menu is presented at first since patrons usually go for their daily specials. Don't worry - the food is reasonably priced!

My friends and I stumbled upon this place on Yelp while we were in the area and we absolutely loved it.

Trattoria has a nice variety of dishes, but they specialize in pasta, which they pride in making it exactly how they do in Italy. My friends ordered the butternut squash ravioli and lamb ragu and found that the pasta was cooked al dente with a perfectly balanced sauce that didn't overpower the dish. 

I ordered chicken breast stuffed with ricotta cheese. The chicken was cooked nicely and was still very juicy - a tough feat especially with breast meat!

The service was absolutely spectacular. They were very attentive and made you feel like you were part of their family.

Even though it is quite far away from where I live, I would definitely make the trek back to this wonderful restaurant."}
