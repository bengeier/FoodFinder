{"text":"Spent over $70 on variety of dishes. Wonton soup was literally water boiled wontons with a ton of pepper on bottom with no taste at all. Butter chicken was really bland tasting except for way too much hot sauce added and no taste of tomatoes. Manchurian chicken had 6 small pieces of chicken and sauce was tasteless. Ginger beef had exact same taste and texture as frozen from Walmart. As well all the meat in every dish was really soft with no texture which can only mean everything is coming processed and/or frozen. Owner swore he has never had any complaints about these issues but I wish I would have checked online before ordering as there are multiple people who have had same experience."}

{"text":"Absolutely horrible food.  Ordered the fried rice that tasted like it was 3 days old.. Stale as hell.  The nihari tasted like paya. chilli chicken had no chilli flavour and the corn soup tasted like boiled water with over boiled chicken shreds.  Would not even recommend this place to my enemy.  Spent about $100.00 and got dog food."}
