{"text":"Hot Ham and Cheese oh man is it gooood. Jamming to good old songs and hanging out with family and some friends."}
{"text":"Loved this food when they were in Gastonia, but I don't make it out to Belmont so much. I ate there the other night though and it was the same as I remember. I had a pizza pocket I customized, but honestly it was too much bread. The pizza was MUCH better. Pretzel drops were also pretty good. No complaints service wise, so we will be back."}
{"text":"Was travelling through on my way to visit relatives in NC.  Staff didn't seem to like strangers.  Wasn't treated very well.  Felt like I was intruding.  Service was barely friendly and very slow and apathetic.  Food was very sub-par for the prices.  Service should have been excellent, considering how few tables were occupied.  I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"We ate here a few months ago. I never posted a review because it was pretty average; I didn't feel strongly that it was above or below average; just your average independent pizza place.The pizza was ok; the service was below average."}
{"text":"I ate there for the first time today for lunch.  Special was a ten inch with three toppings and a drink for 6.95 which sounded great.  What I got was a ten inch with with too much cheese and one piece of beef, one piece of sausage, and one piece of an onion.  I guess when you add that up it comes to three toppings.  Doubt I'll be going back or recommending.  Too bad."}
{"text":"We haven't been here since they moved to the Belmont location. It was great though and we have missed it! We had a great server (Marin) and enjoyed ourselves. The Greek salad was very good and the kids loved the pizza."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Huge variety and selection of food. Had the Bullfrog Pizza and Medium Wings! The food was absolutely delicious and the service was outstanding! Totally recommend Johnny B's to anyone."}
{"text":"Best Gluten free pizza I've ever had! Love the Honey Garlic Wings, as well. Great staff..our family's favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"This pizza is our guilty pleasure. We wished they delivered. We don't often eat pizza, but when we eat pizza...we eat Johnny B's. So glad they moved from Gastonia. Well...and... Go Blue!!"}
{"text":"The pretzel bites were very good I thought.  I also got a sausage and pepperoni pocket.  That was just okay.  The $2 Stellas were a nice bonus on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"The meal started with the chef salad. $9 for the large, which is a handful of bag lettuce with pizza toppings haphazardly thrown on top.  The gluten free pizza was good for what it is. Udi's 10 inch pizza crust with cheese.   Service was lackluster. I have been here 4-5 times and they must be under new management or are losing money and are cutting costs.   Blah.   Could be worse, could have been better."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was not however. The waitress was overworked while two others stood on their phones. Took forever to get out appetizer, which was garlic bread, and then couldn't get my water refilled. Food was very good, and if you have 1.5 hours to kill it's a great place."}
{"text":"What an awful place! Rude staff, bad service, and lousy food. Very disappointing. Plenty of other places in the area that are better choices!"}
{"text":"My family comes here about once a week. We love the staff and the food. The pizza has a great crust and the sauce has just a little bit of zing. Lots of toppings so people can select very creative pizzas.   They also have wings...oven roasted. I love these. They have a special sauce called the BLowe sauce...it's awesome...a hot honey barbq sauce.   They have a \"frequent diners\" program too that is helpful for families like mine.   A great spot in Belmont...good pizza. good prices. good times."}
{"text":"Great family place. Lacks A/C but don't let that deter you. Pizza was perfectly cooked. Service was spot on. Will return."}
{"text":"I am always grateful for new restaurants and bars in Belmont but Johnny B's isn't exactly what I've been looking for.  The hubby and I stopped in here with high hopes for a good pizza place close to home.  The pizza was palatable but not the best I've had, and probably not the best pizza in Belmont.  The crust seemed to be a good medium thickness with fluffy crust around the edge, but the toppings weren't the best quality.  Our pizza had a puddle of liquid of unknown origin in the middle, I'm guessing from the mushroom and jalapeno toppings?  The decor and seating in the restaurant is not very inviting at all.  The wooden booths, tables, and chairs all look like they came from a second hand store and there isn't one seat cushion in the entire place.  This gave the whole restaurant a cheap feeling.  The main dining area is painted with bold red and green colors, but there isn't a single decoration on the walls.  The wait staff are all teenagers with the exception of the bartender.  The only reason I mention this is because our waitress seemed inexperienced.  She kept coming to our table and asking us if we wanted refills.  While I appreciate that she recognized our drinks were low, it seemed weird that she didn't just refill them without asking.  I would be more likely to come back if Johnny B's added some seat cushions and cozied the place up a little."}
{"text":"We always have to stop if we are any where near this place. The Service is always over the Top and the best pizza.love to sit at the High Top Table and watch our favorite sporting event. Got to go, it's time to beat my Son in Silver Strike Live Bowling."}
{"text":"Johnny B's is one of my favorite Belmont spots! It's a more affordable and slightly more relaxed option than most offerings in downtown Belmont.  Pretzel drops are a must-have to start. Dough drops come baked to perfection and tossed in a parmesan-butter sauce. (And they are always tossing out coupons for free ones--double bonus! Your Yelp check-in can even get you free ones!) There's no way to go wrong with their pizzas either. I'm a classic girl and tend to err towards a plain ol' pepperoni pizza. It's always positively perfect! Service is always fast & attentive as well!  Life Hack: If you're wanting a cozier night at home, for just a few dollars, you can also order fresh dough from Johnny B's and make your own pizza at home, too!"}
{"text":"The place is run by a hateful bigot. His food and service are no doubt filled with the same vile hatred."}
{"text":"I'ts ok just another pizza place in Belmont. A bit pricey for what it is. The wings are baked so not crispy at all more like slimy. Pizza is not bad but not great either."}
{"text":"Always a good time and food is definitely good for Italian food.  The pretzels dots are amazing."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great pizza and the staff is awesome. We come here as often as we can."}
{"text":"Pizza needs 3 things: crust, sauce and toppings. This original crust is excellent, reminds me of New York style. Sauce is a little sweet, but it's good. Toppings... Diced too much for me, not enough of them, not so good. Atmosphere was fun and a full house. Local not a chain, so overall 4 stars. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are fairly new to the Belmont area so we're currently exploring new places to eat/drink within the town.  We had a craving for pizza and wanted to try something new - there in-lies the reasoning behind choosing Johnny B's. We got there around 6:30pm on a Saturday, and to our amazement the place was dead. Maybe two tables occupied? This was not a good sign in my opinion when initially entering a new restaurant.   The hostess was very pleasant, greeted us with a warm smile, and of course some southern hospitality. No complaints there. We set down and ordered some pretzel bites (Free - courtesy of checking in on Yelp), a Greek salad, and their house meat lovers pizza (forgot the exact name on the menu). The salad was okay, pretzel bites were okay, pizza was okay, the tap selection was unimpressive (the only local variety was OMB copper).....that pretty much sums this place up. Average at best."}
{"text":"Left after receiving our drinks. Went in with my son, a few people in the place. The host was not a host at all. I had to speak to him or he would of probably let us stand waiting on a table. An open booth was available but for some reason he wanted to clean a dirty table off for us. We got seated and one waitress took our order for our drinks. Another waitress brought us our drinks and said another waitress would come take our order. We waited on her but no one ever came. A group of 8 came in and there order was taken before our waitress came. We walked out. When we left, the host was playing on his phone and never said a word to us when we left. Never try it again."}
{"text":"Really great pizza! The sauce and crust is simply delicious! It gets a bit chaotic when busy but worth the wait. Nothing fancy; just great folks and pizza!"}
{"text":"They by far have the best pizza I have EVER had! It's even up there with NYC pizza, in my opinion. Their prices are VERY reasonable, and the pretzel bites are to die for!! Definitely go there!! Plus they have cheap beer on Fridays!"}
{"text":"Johnny B's has excellent pizza and wings! The Buffalo Chicken Pizza is awesome and the Salt and Pepper wings may be the best wings I have ever eaten. Belmont is a small town off the beaten path, so if you see a bad review from somebody in another state they almost definitely have an agenda and have never eaten there. If you haven't tried Johnny B's you need to try them - you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Great place will be back... Jock welcomed us had good conversation and answered questions i had no problem will be back"}
{"text":"Usually get a pizza, but today I went with the meatball hoagie. Awesome sandwich. Mix of mozzarella and provolone cheeses, good size meatballs with an awesome marina sauce. 6\" was plenty to fill me up!"}
{"text":"I had cheese steak with mushroom. It was good enough to Definitely visit again. I will always get takeout because the inside looks depressing. Cashier could be more friendly but I guess I interrupted her phone conversation and cigarette smoke break. Oh well...... So i went back that night and got another one for my hubby, it was TERRIBLE! i guess its all who is cooking it that makes the difference."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pie and it wasn't too great.  The pizza was just so dense and greasy, and very heavy on the cheese.  They have the right idea with the thin crust but just need to workout the dough and how much cheese/sauce they put on.    Maybe it's a good place for the area but if you're from up north you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"Giving the place a shot from all the good reviews. 4 new frog mouths with a little tadpole."}
{"text":"Go to pizza place in the Charlotte area. Best pizza and wings I've ever had! Must try the buffalo chicken pizza or any pocket."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Belmont, NC and stopped into Johnny B's for a quick, late-night bite. We walked in around 8:45 on Sunday night not knowing they closed at 9:00. I loved that they stayed open instead of telling us they were getting ready to close.   The woman behind the bar greeted us at one of the high-top tables. She was very friendly. We ordered Copper beers, a Greek salad, and the garlic/olive oil based pizza with cheese and tomatoes (I can't remember the name of it). The salad wasn't exactly \"Greek\" but it was tasty and the pizza had a bit too much garlic on it for my liking.   Overall, we'll be back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Had the chef salad with grilled chicken.  Very good and was plenty to eat.  Johnny B's is a good spot for pizzas and beers with a cozy atmosphere and friendly service.  Good spot for families."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place. The staff is friendly and the food comes out quickly. The owner takes a lot of pride in his food and frequently steps out of the kitchen to make sure you are happy. He even brought back sun dried tomatoes at our request!  We tried the thin crust for the first time last night and it is now our favorite. Also if you like a good hot sub try the potato salad as a side, it's outstanding."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza i will drive 20 mins to get to it lol A month ago I tried to go to Johnny bs but they were having a private event an actually were running out of pizza  but i had heard enough good things I would come back I live in Charlotte but I get my hair done in Mount Holly. Well finally last night I got to taste what all the town folks there were talking about We ordered an appetizer I had been told about Pretzel drops oh my goodness yum . Its their pizza dough cut in bite size pieces served with pizza sauce. Our pizza was one of their speciality pizzaa. It was their sauce with mozzarella an banana peppers  with fresh garlic an sliced meatballs. Wow so good toppings fresh an pizza crust crispy an the meatball slices wow no shortage   On your pizza. We also had meet a couple they were regulars they had wings with their pizza. They said the wings are so good best wings mmm gotta try those next time. This is a hole in the wall which is always my favorite place to eat. If your in Mount Holly,belmont or Gastonia area go get you some pizza an get the pretzel drops for sure"}
{"text":"We love local pizza over chains and have tried multiple places, here you can get a true glutton free crust and the pizza is just as good if we ordered normal. The kids love the wraps and pretzel drops. Hubby always gets the buffalo pizza. Consistently good does not vary wk by wk."}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza around. Frozen Pond and garlic honey wings are a family favorite. Rest of menu is good."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Belmont. That is if you don't mind eating there or taking out.   I'd order Johnny B's over the Hut any day!  The Hut delivers.  Convenience in PJ's wins.  JB's pizza is great!"}
{"text":"Johnny B's version 2.0 - I like it.  Love that they had a Groupon not too long ago - got soft drinks, 2 huge servings of wings, a large salad, and kid's pizza for under 5 bucks!  (Plus tip, of course!)  The only thing that stinks is that it was really cold and the only seat available was by the door - avoid that spot like the plague if you can!  Family friendly atmosphere, good service, great location.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I think we found our go to pizza place. Incredible pizza, chewy hand tossed crust and tons of options. Service was great, staff very welcoming! You can split pizzas in half (at least med or large) so we went half marinara with pepperoni and sausage and the other half was oil garlic base with artichoke, spinach and sun-dried tomatoes. Amazing pizza and great atmosphere! Check in for the first time and get free pretzel bites!!   We will go back soon and often!"}
{"text":"We went in for the first time and were warmly greeted by Cory.  We ordered a original crust with half pepperoni and half mushrooms and sausage.  Real mushrooms.   The crust was incredible. Pizza was in a perfect Ratio  the crust to sauce to cheese and toppings.  It was fast and delicious  and Cory kept our soda cups always topped off.  It was a great experience with even better Food  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Home town owned restaurant, great atmosphere, good selection of beers, friendly staff and excellent Pizza!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza and sandwiches and salads . They do help the local high school football teams by offering discounts on their cards . Parking is limited . Nice location in down town . Locals enjoy it and I always see a friendly face . Service is good -staff has always been friendly. We enjoy going for lunch as a family"}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way home to Charlotte. It was a pleasant little surprise. The food and service was really good, and very affordable too. The salt and pepper wings are awesome FYI. We will return."}
{"text":"Very delicious Frozen Pond pizza. It didn't have tomato sauce on it so I'd like to taste another one with tomato sauce. I got a free order of Pretzel Drops because I checked in on Yelp here! Nice! The Pretzel Drops were lacking flavor, I would suggest adding more garlic salt and the marina sauce it came with had almost a too-sweet flavor."}
{"text":"HOT RANCH!!! We ordered takeout and we get home we open the box of wings and our ranch is sitting in the wing sauce covered in wing sauce and hot. The wings were pretty good we got hot. The pizza was actually the upside. It was a little bit soggy in the middle of the pizza but I attribute that to being in the box. Their crust is amazing, and the toppings were top notch. Spoke with Corey on the phone and he was delightful and helpful. I think will give this place another shot but I don't know if we'll ever order takeout again. Definitely not worth the five stars that everybody is giving it though."}
{"text":"The honey garlic wings and supreme style pizza were really great. Miley was our server - top notch. Can't believe I've lived in Belmont a year and haven't been here yet. Will be here regularly!"}
{"text":"Went to Johnny B's last week in Belmont. When I find myself in Belmont, I always head to Johnny B's. The Pretzel Drops are a must-have as a starter. They are doughy, buttery, and parmaseany, and they come with marinara sauce for dipping.   I also spring for the Lily Pad pizza. It's a pesto-based pizza with cheese and veggies. They have really good, fresh, doughy crust that I love.  Johnny B's has ample street parking and is in a fun area of Belmont. Service has always been good!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza place. Cool atmosphere as well. Parking can be a challenge but definitely worth it."}
