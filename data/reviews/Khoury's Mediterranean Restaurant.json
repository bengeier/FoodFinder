{"text":"Premium place with premium qualities.best food of my life.So generous,and real lebanese food.Simply the best man'oushe in town.the whole idea is just homey and authentic,from location itself to the smell and taste to the friendly welcoming ,I just love it."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was friendly, efficient, and added a warm touch to a lovely restaurant. Baklava was to die for!!! Definitely worth the drive it takes from our home. Keep up the fantastic business, Khoury's!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner.  Between 2 people, we got the Mini-Mezza appetizer and the combo Kabob with shrimp, beef, and chicken.  The app was good.  Little bit of each of the dips... still too much for us.  The kabobs were great.  Tender, juicy, flavorful- delicious.  And the rice it came on was awesome.  I needed the to-go box to come sooner so I would stop eating it.

Overall, loved our meal and had enough leftovers for at least another meal, probably 2.  Good vibe, small place with only a few other tables occupied.  Will go back!"}
{"text":"POOR SERVICE !!!

The first time I eat there the service was slow (one waitress who tried her best) but I wanted to give the them benefit of a doubt. We waited 35 minutes for the main course.  I came home and had a VERY BAD stomach ache.  In my opinion the meat was NOT fresh.  I eat meat on a regular basis and being from the middle-east I am used to it.  So I went there the second time and order a FELAFEL SANDWICH. Not only did it take LONG TIME to get the sandwich, it looked NOT FRESH. I barely touched it. 

To make matters worse, the waitress didn't even care that I barely touched my plate and presented me with a $15.62 check.  WHAT A JOKE !!!!  

I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT TO ME, ITS ONE THING IF THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMER NOT EATING THEIR FOOD, YET QUITE ANOTHER TO CHARGE THEM FOR IT..!!!!  EAAKKKKKK!!!"}
{"text":"Great tabouli and great kefteh.  I would recommend for authentic Lebanese food.  The brick oven bread comes out piping hot and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This Mediterranean Lebanese restaurant is amazing I haven't been here since they relocated to their new location. I love this place the food is amazing very tasty. The customer service is amazing the price is just right. The portions are a great value."}
{"text":"The food is awesome.....but be prepared to wait, especially if you order online. Actually, don't order online because most likely their \"internet isn't working\""}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! The WORSE service i have ever experienced. Took 10 minutes just to get seated. took another 10-15 minutes before a waitress even talked to us. Took another 15 minutes to get my coke. By then i was very frustrated. After drink came then the waitress had the nerve to tell me she would be back to take my order. Cant even imagine how long that would have taken. Told her we waited long enough and we were leaving. No excuses for that TERRIBLE service. It was after 2 and there were plenty of employees there. Just bad management and the worse service i have ever been a part of. Customer service is NOT their specialty. They acted like we were bothering them. I am Lebanese and just moved to Vegas and when my relatives come to visit, i will NEVER take them to KHOURY'S"}
{"text":"Lebanese mediterranean food, the chicken shawerma sandwich was quite tasty, very good fresh pita bread too!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a vibrant atmosphere that's only surpassed by the delicious and generous platters, then Khoury's Mediterranean is the only place that matters!! Our server Lana was extremely kind and took fantastic care of us the entire night. Her recommendations for dessert could not have been more spot on!"}
{"text":"My favorite Lebanese restaurant in town. Great place fast and reasonablely priced fresh food. Fresh baked bread. Love the hummus!!!!"}
{"text":"High priced, average food and below average service.  Have not rushed back here,"}
{"text":"Will come here again. Loved the lamb kabob. Our waitress April was great. She's the best Hungarian waitress in a Greek Restaurant I've ever had."}
{"text":"The place is addicting...  The food is delish..  Staff is beyond friendly.  Discovered this place one week ago and have eaten there 3 times!! The Schwarma  lamb and chicken is good very flavorful, the salads are fresh and tasty, even the pita bread is yum. Keep up the good work staff!!"}
{"text":"Great apps! Elham is a fantastic server, ask for her if you go, but you shouldn't everything else was horrible! Just go next store to DW bistro instead!"}
{"text":"The waitresses that work weekdays are awesome - I think I'm in love (non-creepy kind) with one of them.   I think she's Middle Eastern or Italian...on second thought, she might be some kind of Spanish.  Anyway, the food is great - especially the Shwarma and lentil soup.  The hummus and pita can be described in one word: totally awesome.  I realize that's two words, but I got excited when trying to come up with a description.  

Oh, and if you're a fan of classy interior decoration, you're in for a treat.  If you've ever wondered to yourself \"who buys the broken crap in the sale bins at Home Goods\" - now you know.  It's an elegant mix of Middle Eastern, Country, and random.  

They even have a deer made out of stone near the cash register - classy.  They're mixing exterior lawn decoration, with the interior.  Am I inside?  Am I outside?  Who knows?  Once you get your food, you'll stop caring and your mind will focus on the awesome flavors and smells.  Which by the way, make your fridge smell like a Persian carpet salesman if left overnight.  Not complaining, just stating fact.

Seriously though, go here, your stomach will thank you, unless you have an ungrateful stomach. ;-)"}
{"text":"I work next door and get lunch from here pretty much every day. Everything is so tasty, authentic and homie feeling. Sooo good."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! The beef kabobs are to die for and their hummus is super delicious! We are always here but this time we were impressed! Our server April is super nice and catered us with our needs. I recommend this place for romantic dates and casual lunch breaks!"}
{"text":"Always come here, I recommend this place for quality delicious food. Went to other Mediterranean rest. And nothing tops Khoury's. Love love love this place!!! This is real food!!! Went to Parsley in east side and all I can say is \"yuck!\". Khoury's is the BEST! This establishment needs to do delivery. I know soo many people who want delivery from Khoury's!"}
{"text":"Just visited from Michigan the mecca of Arabic food.  I was not disappointed in the least.  The food was incredible and the service was impeccable. My server Lana picked my food selections and it was to die for. From the jalapeno hummus to the special of the day i was so impressed.  I would recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family. MUST GO!!!"}
{"text":"I have been is the states for 32 years this is the best Lebanese cuisine I have tried first class authentic food fanie is the best host and server we a recommended it everything was excellent and the service is second to none five stars all the way"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE!!!!!!! My best friend is Lebanese and this is just like her cooking!!!! Had the chicken kabob, babaganoush, hummus and fresh lemonade. Will be back"}
{"text":"Last saturday night, my wife and I had the dinner for 2 (39.95.) before ordering, i questioned the server about the size of the portions, she assured me that they were only slightly smaller than the portions  on the ala carte menu. Our dinner included: freshly made pita bread, soup or salad for each of us, 
1 appetizer to share, 2 entrees and 2 desserts. 
Everything was wonderful until the entrees were served. The beef shwarma was fine, but the chicken was an outrageously small 1/4 of a chicken accompanied by very greasy roasted  potatoes and carrots. In my 60 + years I have never seen a chicken that small. It should be against the law to slaughter a chicken  that young. 
When i told the server about my dissapointment she told me the  ala carte entree was the same size, but it included  2 pieces of chicken. Since i inquired about the size of the portions rightup front, she should have warned me about the size of the portion when i was ordering. She also dissapared for quite awhile toward the end of the meal. aside from that the service was good.
Very good greek salad, grape leaves, beef shwarma, baklava and pita bread. 
Decent lentil soup and rice pudding
Dinner without the chicken 4.5 stars
Dinner with the chicken 2.5 stars.
Service 3.5 stars
Overall 3 stars"}
{"text":"First time eating here and was very impressed! The ambiance was comfortable and inviting.  The presentation of the food was gorgeous and tasted delicious! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Awsome service Lana. Great food. Definitely will come back again.
I like their bread and hummus."}
{"text":"An amazing and authentic restaurant!  Everything was so great, fresh pita bread, goat cheese, kabobs, lentil soup, and baklava.  A great find and a great reason to leave the strip. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here. Arrived before the lunch rush & ordered turkish coffee medium sweet. Took 30 minutes to make a 5 minute coffee & arrived with no sugar. Today the service sucks. This restaurant has very good food to have poor service."}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere and service. As a Lebanese American I'm always greatly satisfied each time we come!!"}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise , we were headed to another nearby restaurant but the line was too long, so we opted to try Khoury's. We were not disappointed, since we had not been there before we opted for the four coarse meal for two so we could try more. The couple with us ordered a sandwich and shrimp. We all enjoyed everything. The spicy hummus was amazing. While I have had little experience with Mediterranean food I loved the food and a Extensive meal for 4 with deserts was a great value at under $75. We had a great lunch the next day with leftovers. Also the tasty bread comes to you right out of the oven. It was fun to watch it made. We will be back."}
{"text":"I will not ever go back to this place...

My out of country relatives were about to leave the town and we decided to take them out for a dinner at Khoury's. Place was absolutely empty that evening so I thought we will get full attention of server and the kitchen staff but it turned out that they didn't care for us bringing them business that night at all.

We ordered $40 dinner specials and it was a worst disappointment ever. Bread was stale and turned into dried up pieces within 10 minutes. Soup was OK. The worst part was the entrees. Lamb shawarma was dry and had a funny taste to it. Rice looked like it was re-heated after sitting in a container for a while. I really tried to eat the meat but it was so unappetizing that I gave up after a few bites. My relatives were not happy eaters either. After a bit of a hesitation I tried to explain to the server that our food (especially for the money we paid) is far from acceptable. She was apologetic but told us that she cannot do anything about it and she has to call the manager. 
After some time so called manager showed up (he claimed to be a manger but I know he is the owner) and gave us \"I don't really care\" look and offered 10% discount and some food to go. This is a slap in a face! We didn't like the food in a first place and now we are being offered same horrible food to go! 10% discount - please.... I don't want to pay for it at all the way it was prepared! In the end I didn't want to argue  (especially in front of our relatives that don't speak much English) and settled the bill as it is.

P.S. Upset stomach for 3 people in our party till next day... 
Worst $100 ever spent on dining out."}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean-Lebanese cuisine! I stopped in for dinner with family and tried a few dishes including the Mtabal Baba Bhanoush (appetizer) and ordered the Shwarma Plate.  The Mtabal Baba Bhanoush ($8.50) is basically grilled eggplant mashed with garlic, lemon and sesame oil served with fresh baked pita bread.  The Pita Bread here is delicious, we recieved a basket of hot and puffy pita with the appetizer.  I had the Lamb Shawarma Plate ($16.50) and it was served with VERY generous portions of sliced grilled lamb and rice, also included tomatoes, onions, pickles and shawarma sauce. The shawarma sauce is listed on menu as a Tahini sauce, it was very creamy tahini.  The entire meal was very delicious and flavorful.  

The menu has a lot to choose from and includes a large variety of gluten free and vegetarian dishes. I'll be back to try a few other items including their salad and kabob menus."}
{"text":"I never dined at Khoury's when it was on Fort Apache although it had a fine reputation.  We tried the new location today and am I glad that we did!  The restaurant is certainly pretty and there is truly not a bad table in the place.  They are thoughtfully spaced so that a private conversation is possible.  The service is also excellent.  Our server, Fanie, was very pleasant and seemed genuinely committed to our needs.  The cuisine was excellent and fresher than fresh.  I always measure a Mediterranean restaurant by its hummus and pita bread.  We started with the Jalapeño Hummus which was creamy and flavorful.  It was not hot, but had just the right touch of jalapeño.  The pita was light and puffy.  We also shared a Lebanese salad of tomatoes, cucumbers and red onions, lightly dressed in a minty lemon juice dressing.  It was very fresh and as good as it was on its own, would be a perfect accompaniment to any of the entrees.  We shared a Lebanese sandwich of ground lamb and spices.  It had an interesting savory sweet flavor going on and was quite delicious. The fries were very tasty, too.  Finally, Fanie treated us to an order of baklava.  As full as I was, this was the perfect ending to our meal.  It was sweet but not overly so.  Khoury's is a winner and its new location in a Village Square means that we will be frequent diners!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! We've been driving past this hidden gem for years, and finally stopped in for lunch to sample the menu. Both the service and food was top notch. I have dietary restrictions and allergies, and our server April took extra care to ensure my needs were met. Every recommendation she made was spot on, and every dish delicious. We had deep fried cauliflower, spinach ftayir, the gyro sandwich, lamb kabobs, and finished the meal with an out-of-this-world shabiet. We will definitely be returning soon. Well done!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great patio seating. Excellent lentil soup, sangria, and falafel.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Their service is great their food delicious. I love the gyro sandwich. And I like the outdoor seating to. They don't rush you out we sat there and talked for at least a few hours and enjoyed our time. The warm pita bread and spices with olive oil is just a nice starter."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the ambiance is good.  It is a great family restaurant. The Kibbi and Farooj are awesome!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.   Fresh,  tasty food, friendly service.   Even fresh pitas to take home at no charge!  Will return soon."}
{"text":"While the food at Khoury's is plentiful, and flavorful, the service is beyond bad. On the 4 occasions that I have eaten here we have had to wait for over 20 minutes just to have water brought to our table. On a few occasions the owners son was serving tables. This would be okay if his son were not 10. I'm sorry, but I do not go out to have a 10 year old serve my food to me. His hands were dirty and his manners were very poor. 

The owner also does not seem to care about the service. On our last visit when I mentioned that we had to wait so long to be greeted and brought water at our table, he simply smiled and said that if we didn't like it to never come back. I smiled back and told him that I would take him up on that suggestion and while I was at it pass the suggestion on to a few others along the way. 

Stay away from Khoury's, unless you like dirty little 10 year olds with poor manners serving you your food."}
{"text":"YUM!! I have been here twice and had a great experience both times. The pita bread is fabulous. This is the type of restaurant where you sit down and enjoy the experience. Take your time and enjoy the ambiance and food. It is great Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Pita's hot and fresh. Food was a bit salty but the Sangria fixed it.. Btw sangria = STRONG! Great service and great place to eat. Can't wait to come back for seconds and Maybe try their hookah too.. :)"}
{"text":"I am Lebanese and this is the best authentic restaurant i've found in Las Vegas for Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Very good service!  I liked the family atmosphere.  The appetizers were great!  Hummus was excellent.  Very good baba ganoush.  Baklava for dessert was different than I am used to but very, very good.  Unfortunately the lamb kabob was overcooked and didn't have much flavor. My wife felt the same way about her beef kabob. However, everything else was good enough for me try them again.  Hopefully it was a one time cooking error."}
{"text":"Excellent as always. I recommend the Mini Mezza as an entre. The tabouli salad is exceptionally fresh. The staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food, especially Lebanese food so gave this place a shot. 
YUCK!
Falafels were dry, barely enough sauce to go around. And 10 bucks for 4 is rip off. 
I ordered the Lebanese sandwich. Nothing Lebanese about it. Looked like my 2 year nephew used diaper. Went straight the garbage
Fries completely uneatable. Soggy, greasy and barely warm. Screwing up fries is really had to do. Those went to the garbage too. 
So I ate 4 falafels for 29 bucks.
Never going back! This place sucks"}
{"text":"Great Middle Eastern food, perhaps the best I have ever tried.  The back of the house gets 5 stars because the menu is varied and all the food tastes excellent.  The front of the house gets 2-3 stars.  The wait staff means well and tries hard, but the front of the house is not organized properly.  The wait staff has to multi-task as hostess, cashier, phone answerer, and table bussers.  This makes everything in the front of the house take twice as long as it should.  The food is great, but be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"We really enjoy of having our lunch here. wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the special hummus. Thank you."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this hidden gem 3 months ago w my sister. I had their lamb gyro and its was very fresh, the pita bread is fresh out of oven. All the food is gourmet, you can honestly taste the freshness. The baklava is amazing!!
Cannot forget to mention our AMAZING server Miss April!"}
{"text":"The worst food we ever had!!! Everything is way over salty and if you want to have Heart attack symtoms, visit Khoury's. Meats feels very rubbery and uncooked as if your eating a rare steak but it's kafta kabob!!!

Over priced for junk food!!!


We  will be notifying the health department a swell."}
{"text":"So I'm probably biased because I've actually lived in the Middle East and worked as a cook while living there, but I wasn't impressed by anything that I ordered.  I went here because I miss a lot of the food that I used to get while living over there, and was hoping maybe this place could alleviate some of that.  Alas, it was not to be.  So I ordered the lunch meat combo as I wanted to try out the sujuk and kibbi, and was rather disappointed in it.  The sujuk came out dry, while the kibbi was rather tasty so I was happy with that.  The rice they served with it was fine, but they went and raw onion on the plate that kind of overwhelmed whatever you tried to eat it with.  Also, their \"grilled\" veggies that they served with it were pretty much raw, not appealing.  I would say that the biggest issue I had there was with their pita, it was overcooked, period.  Even the fresh pita I got midway through my meal was crunchy on the bottom!  Pita should NEVER be crunchy!  Also, it still had flour or something on the outside of it that was kind of grainy and not particularly appealing.  I was also somewhat annoyed to find out that I got charged for the side of pickled veggies that I asked for without being told that first by the server.  Normally at Mediterranean restaurants those pickles come with everything, so kind of surprising.  Overall, if I do end up going back to this place, I'll probably try a pizza as I've heard better things about them."}
{"text":"The fatoosh salad with chicken shwarma is amazing and our waitress April was excellent!"}
{"text":"We LOVE love LOVE Khoury's.  We live right around the corner, and Khoury's is like a good glass of wine and pasta, except it is a good glass of Pomegranate Sangria and fresh baked pita bread.  Did I mention the delicious baklava?! We are predictable, and order the same thing every time (ok, well I do!).  We get the Dinner for Two for $39.95, which includes an appetizer, salad, entree and dessert! Not bad!!  I love the chicken kabob and the baba ganoush.  Khoury's also has a rewards card you can use, just ask the waitress/server.  Every time we have gone, our service is great!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant a few weeks ago and am writing from memory. That being said I went to this restaurant based on reviews. I have to admit I was let down in ways. The decor is better than I had expected, for some reason I thought it would be extremely causal aka Roberto's causal. The prices seem a bit steep for what you received. I enjoyed the variety on the menu and found it interesting that they served raw lamb.  I was disappointed when we asked for an eggplant dish after studying the menu judiciously and was told that they did not have that dish and that \"eggplants were hard to come by\" which is news to me. They served some sort of puffed bread which I found unusual and enjoyed. The quality of the food was good, not outstanding or even that memorable, but good enough that if I were in the neighborhood and they had a special I may come back. I believe the review I read for this restaurant recommended the baby eggplant appetizer - I tried this and it was different, which I can appreciate."}
{"text":"Initially got a table for 8, but only 5 people sat down and ate. When the bill came, we asked to split the bill in 5. I asked her to show me the original bill and asked her if gratuity was automatically charged. She said she does know, but that was clearly a white lie because she entered in the system as party of 8 that included gratuity. The server was deceitful. Will never go back. Food was decent. I could have been a repeat customer if I hadn't been cheated on."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out. It was ok. Our service was great. My sister and I ordered the lunch beef kabob skewers w/ tabbuli, hummus, and baba ghanoush. I wasn't crazy about the beef skewer. It tasted like boiled beef. I was expecting it to have more of a \"grilled\" taste. We also ordered the chicken shawarma plate, which was recommended by our server. That was good. The portions are HUGE! \"Check-in\" on yelp and get  free hummus!"}
{"text":"I was taken to Khoury's by a friend, and I do have to say that I enjoyed my experience! So much so that I have been there a couple of times since. I DO think that it is a bit pricy for Mediterranean food, but it is worth visiting for the pita bread alone. You can see it coming fresh out of the ovens. It is served warm and is excellent with every dish that they have!

Speaking of dishes, make sure that you try their lentil soup as a starter! It is delicious.

I am a big fan of their kabobs. Their sandwiches are also excellent and come with french fries that are pretty delicious!"}
{"text":"We had the min mezza and it was fantastic. We also shared the beef kabob, the Farooj (baked chicken) was very flavorful and it had lovely carrots and vegetables. The stuffed cabbage was delicious and the warm pita was great. My parents really enjoyed it and this was my Mom's first time dining at a Lebanese restaurant and she loved it. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"So happy they are closer to home!  Food is great, portions are huge, and atmosphere casual and comfortable.  I'd recommend the kabobs if you're a carnivore.  The \"lamb over hummus\" which hubby got one time was dry and over cooked because the meat is shredded but the lamb kabob was juicy and perfect.  Kiddo liked the chicken schwarma wrap and it comes with gorgeous fries.  I get the chicken kabob everytime because it rocks.  The pita comes out warm and fluffy!  

But my litmus test for any middle eastern place is falafel and they nailed it.  If you can handle the heat, order a side of hot sauce - it's lemony blended jalapeño and it's really tasty.  

BTW we ordered take out recently and it's literally the best take out I've ever had.  The portions are just as big and they threw in extra pitas."}
{"text":"Wow..... It was awesome food. We odder Baba ghanous and rice. Amazing taste. Rice has some different kind of special taste. Worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, I also get carry out because it is close to my house.  The food has always been really good, I generally get the beef dinner combo.  The bread and rice are really good, when I order with a friend I generally get the humus as an appetizer which is also really good.  This is definitely the best Mediterranean food in the southwest of Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Anything I've ordered has been so good and consistent every time!! From the hummus /fresh pita  to the lintel soup or my favorite Greek salad with chicken swigmira , I've yet to be let down!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a buddy of mine and had a pretty good meal.

I tried \"Fool\" for the first time, and thought it was pretty good.  I don't know how it stacks up against other Fool though.   My soup mid course was very good and the main course of lemon peppered lamb over hummus was good, all though it was a little cold.  This was no doubt influenced by it being on bed of refrigerator cold hummus.  

All that being said, the friendly service from Sunny and a generally pleasant atmosphere made for a nice experience."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for years. Food is amazing hasn't changed. Authentic food pita bread is the best in town."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in town, but may be the worst service around. The food is generally worth the long wait and slow service. Glad to have this place nearby and you can always order ahead and eat it at home, but allow plenty of lead time for that, too."}
{"text":"Went to Khoury's with a group of friends late night (10pm) to grab a quick dinner.
We proceeded to eat 1 of everything on the menu for the next hour until they closed. The food was delicious and the service is great. If you're anywhere in Vegas, don't miss this place."}
{"text":"I hugely enjoyed the gyro I ordered. This location has a great environment and is definitely family friendly. I'm excited to go back and try the shawarma sandwich that my friend had."}
{"text":"Hot grape leaves lunch, jalapeño hummus, very good! April pleasant, knowledgeable, will return soon!!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love the food at this place. It is awesome, and really delicious. The portions are really huge, so it makes it a fun place to go with friends so you can share and try many menu items. The decor is really pretty and they play fun music that adds to the ethnic atmosphere.

I agree with the other comments that the service is hit-or-miss. I've been there before and the service was great. We went here last night and had horrible service. The server was really friendly but she basically ignored us the entire time. We were sitting out on the patio and we had to go into the restaurant multiple times and ask the server to bring us stuff, because we got sick of waiting for her to come and ask us if we needed anything or to check on us. This included drink refills and even just getting helped right after we got there and were seated. what really ticked me off was that there were more servers in the restaurant than there were customers, and i could see them all congregating and messing around and talking while we were sitting out waiting to be helped. Annoying to say the least! 

If you go there - expect great food but don't be surprised if you get ignored and have to work for your meal!"}
{"text":"I love this place for the food, but the service is exceedingly SLOW but very nice.  Don't go in unless you have the time to spare.

Baba ganosh, hummus and pita with the Greek salad w/ Chicken Sharma are among my favorites.  The dressing for the salad is so simple but incredibly flavorful (lemon, garlic, olive oil).

I keep wanting to take the husband here but we usually think of it on Sunday when they're closed."}
{"text":"Amazing. Lamb was perfectly cooked and so flavorful. That rice though! I would kill for their rice. So delicious. Still thinking about my meal a week later."}
{"text":"Best shawarma sandwich I have had so far in Las Vegas! Will definitely be back for more. They have a nice patio area where they also serve hookah, definitely a place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars
So my friends and I met here for happy hour based on the Yelp reviews and the menu for happy hour on their website.  Half of what is listed on line isn't actually available on their happy hour menu.  That was quite disappointing seeing we ordered based on what we saw on line without looking at the menu.   We were charged full price even after pointing out THEIR menu error.  I give it 3 stars because the food was good, just disappointed in the menu change up.  They won't likely get my dinner business doe to this, or my happy hour business actually.  
Next Friday we try somewhere else."}
{"text":"While the food is pretty good, the service has become increasingly horrible. I placed a to-go phone order and the girl taking my order, April, was very short and rude. She treated me like I was inconveniencing her by placing a phone order. I'm very disappointed as this restaurant used to be one of my faves."}
{"text":"I had tried this place when it had opened and was not impressed but decided to try it again yesterday.  Ordered a takeout of their kabob combo plate of chicken, beef and kafta with rice, pita and lentil soup.  The only edible item was probably the soup.  All the meats were tough, tasteless and burned.  The 2 kabobs were tiny dried up pieces of chicken and \"filet mignon\" beef, which had an unpleasant odor, put on a skewer with similar \"veggie\" pieces.  Kafta was a tiny burned piece of ground meat equally dry and tasteless.  Even the rice was really bad and was \"garnished' with a single broccoli floret. I saw the pita being baked in the oven but it was tough, dry and tasteless as well.  I am from middle east and know what this food should taste like and this was definitely not it, not even close.  Perhaps the owners will take notice and make improvements."}
{"text":"Best hummus in Vegas!!! I love it! And their happy hour is amazing!!! Prices are good and the staff is very nice.
I am a vegetarian and they really have a lot of options."}
{"text":"After reading so many good reviews about this place, I was excited to give it a try.   I love Mediterranean food.   We decided on the Dinner for Two, a great deal because it offers choices from almost everything on the menu.  Well, either I don't understand Lebanese food or we didn't make very good choices.  We had lentil soup, Greek salad, baba ghanoush, baked chicken, and lamb chops.  With the exception of the lamb chops (which were excellent and served with homemade French fries), everything was so overwhelmed with lemon juice that all dishes tasted the same and it was impossible to distinguish any of the other flavors.  The soup, salad, and baba ganoush were all served at the same time, which was fine.  However, aside from the obvious differences in appearance and texture, there was no flavor differences among these dishes - only the overwhelming taste of lemon.  Isn't baba ganoush supposed to be smoothed out with a little tahini?  When my chicken arrived, tasting exactly like the previous dishes, I was already so saturated with lemon that I simply couldn't eat it.  Thank goodness my husband's plate had lots of lamb chops, so he was able to share.  The two stars here are for the lamb chops and the wait staff."}
{"text":"The best mediterranean food I've ever tasted in the U.S so far, and when I say the best food ever I say it as an Arabian guy who grow up in middle East with all this food around. The service was so good just like their music. I would recommend this restaurant to all of you and hell ya I'll go there again whenever I came to Vegas again."}
{"text":"Their food is absolutely delicious here! Especially, their kibi. It is by far one of my most favorite dishes. It is a great place to hang out with friends or come here on a quiet night with your boyfriend or girlfriend. The workers here are very nice and the food is served relatively fast."}
{"text":"Khoury's is your classic Lebanese cuisine, it shares dishes, spices and ingredients from Greek, Turkish, and Israeli food. I have been there 3 times now and I have not been disappointed once. This is the best Mediterranean restaurant I have found so far on the west side of town. The only reason they did not get 5 stars in my book is that they are a bit on the pricey side for lunch, but for the amount of food it is a good value.


P.S. They make fresh pita bread on site in their stone oven, it is to die for!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean food in Las Vegas! Service was lovely and came very fast. We had the falafel sandwich and the garbanzo salad which was very yummy!"}
{"text":"I had a life-changing experience today while I was at Corey's Mediterranean restaurant I had the pleasure of Sana Capital Sana wait on us it was the most pleasant experience I've ever had she was courteous kind bent over backwards to take care all of our needs and make sure before we left that we were 100% satisfied the food was good as always but what an experience to sit down with Sana oh my gosh it was Heaven on Earth whenever you go to Cory's make sure that you ask for sauna she's the absolute best"}
{"text":"I had a great time at this restaurant.  We went off Yelp reviews wanting to find a great mediterranean restaurant.  We were not dissapointed.  Our server Dan was great, even though it appeared as he was new (several questions were responded to in a way you would expect of a new server).  This was perfect for families.  My two young children were with me, and they were setup to accomodate.  The tables had white paper covering them (did not detract from the ambiance).  This made coloring a breeze, which kept the kids busy as we enjoyed the amazing food!  Highly reccomended to try the House Meza (aka \"sampler plate\").   Enough food for three to four people, it gives you a great overview of the type of food the restaurant has to offer.  We also did the Farooj (amazing chicken dish - cheicken was perfectly cooked), Kibbi (meatballs effectively, but tasty!), and Sujuk (beef sausage).   My ONLY complaint would be the favored use of lemon juice and a large amount of dishes.  If you are sensitive to acid as I am, this can cause some issues with the food.

Will return again!"}
{"text":"cozy, little restaurant with an option to dine in the cute patio. we sat inside where the ambiance was great. they had pictures of people that im assuming are family of the owners. i love mediterranean food and khoury's is by far the best one here in vegas! they are very generous with their portions and the food here is excellent! they also serve freshly baked pita. i love their lentil soup. its seasoned perfectly!"}
{"text":"Not too impressed with this place. They were severely understaffed when we were there, leading to an incredibly long wait for not only someone to take our order, but also our food and then our check. Two people that were seated after us walked out after being ignored for 10 minutes. Some of the food was good, especially the lentil soup and the babaganoush, but the meat platter was horribly overcooked. Needless to say, I'm not going back."}
{"text":"It was our first time dining here the decor was very cozy and relaxed. We started our experience off with hummus and Lentil soup. The Lentil soup had to be THE BEST in Vegas. The Bread they delivered to the table with the hummus was fresh out of the oven so that was tasty. Now I am no Mediterranean food expert so I ordered the meat combination that had 5 different prepared pieces of meat. The server was friendly and explained the various pieces of meat. The food was simple but delicious. It was nice having a variety to choose from. The meat portions were just right not over bearing. I would definitely go back again.

In speaking with the server he told us that they have live belly dancers on Saturday nights. No mediterranean restaurant could go without the Hookah which they have on Wednesday nights with a DJ that sometimes goes till 3 in the morning. This is something to check out for sure.

I agree with the staffing level here it was pretty slim but when we went there was only 3 other tables. So it was completely manageable."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, closest food to home, they have the best selection of food, wine and deserts, great service, definitely my favorite place"}
{"text":"I expected great middle eastern food after reading all the other good reviews, all in all it was mediocre, the lamb and meat kabobs were decent, a little chewy, the hummus and baba ganoush were average, the kibbe was for lack of better words odd, it was to Spicey and it looked like it was scooped with an ice cream scooper, it didn't have the nice football shape with a crisp outer shell, again for lack of better words it was \"boingy\" I'm sure if I dropped it it would bounce, and the spinach pies were down right inedible and gross, they are made with phyllo dough (a Greek version) and were soaked in so much oil or butter they were slimy, again a failure, I have yet to find a decent middle eastern restaraunt   in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch since Archie's happened to be closed. I tried the chicken kabobs with hummus. The food was great, but the service was slow. I was on my lunch break, so it would have been nice to have them move a little faster. It was also a little pricy for what I got."}
{"text":"I'm a first time and it was absolutely FABULOUS!!!!! The pita bread that is given complimentary and it is our of this world, I relate it to a soft, warm pillow. 

For an entrée I ordered the Farooj and it was out of this world. It's laid on top of a delicious lemon, Mediterranean garlic sauce, which compliments it well. The vegetables were baked and I didn't leave any behind.

My boyfriend ordered the Shwarama. He really enjoyed this. He got the lamb and cleaned his plate! 

I will definitely be back and cannot wait.

Oh and ask for Rami, he was a great server and made our time pleasurable!"}
{"text":"What made the EXPERIENCE so great, was not merely the food...but George's spot on recommendations.  I recommend the dinner for two."}
{"text":"Went there a couple times. The pita bread is very good, i highly recommend that. but the staff is untrained and the owner (the husband) is somewhat unfriendly/arrogant. The food is not 100% authentic as the owner is 3rd generation Lebanese and the spouse is Jordanian. The place is good if you're looking for some pita and hummus but if you're looking for 100% authentic Lebanese food, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while and I need to come back sooner. I love their hot bread! I tried something out of the norm, as I normally get a gyro. I tried the stuffed cabbage. It tasted better without the tzatziki sauce.  I thought that was a weird combo as a side sauce.  It actually was a better combination with the beef tomato soup.  Very kid friendly.  My daughters enjoyed enjoyed their big portion of cheese pizza.  My 4 year old said it was yummy! Overall, we enjoyed our dinner!"}
{"text":"New location on the west side in Village square is nice, good parking ,  restaurant is well lit but construction still going on inside very visible. Service is friendly as always but also still slow!  Food is wonderful as usual, the jalapeño hummus is excellent all the portions are decent size. The best deal is the dinner for 2 for $40 starter,soup or salad, entree & dessert . The fresh baked pita bread is amazing . The food is all authentic ."}
{"text":"Was close by for a doctor's appointment and yelp introduced me to this place & I fell in love with the place. Exceptional food and service, one of the best meals I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"I love the new location and the food & service continues to be out of this world. A fantastic meal from the fresh pita, the appetizers to the main course. When visiting this part of Las Vegas the old location was a popular stop for me and now I predict this location will be the same."}
{"text":"Delicious food and cute atmosphere. Better than Paymons!  Only complaint is that the food takes forever to come out. Portions are large and ingredients taste fresh and high quality. With the amazing fresh wood fire oven baked pita and an order of hummus, we were full before our dinners finally did arrive. Recommend but only if you have a lot of time to relax and patience."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The pita bread is great. The only draw back is that regardless if they are slow or busy the service is always slow."}
{"text":"ALWAYS CONSISTENT! We fell in love with Lebanese food in 1979! Wherever we live we look for the best Lebanese restaurant and in Las Vegas Khoury's is perfect for us. The hummus is so creamy and wonderful and the addition of a jalapeño hummus is over the top for us spicy flavor nuts. Their tabouli is so fresh and beautifully balanced. Not a bunch of bulgar wheat like some places make it. Perfect amount of parsley, tomatoes and onions with just the right amount of lemon. The falafel's, well  all I can say is OMG! Tahini sauce is perfection in our eyes. The fresh cooked pita bread, right out of the brick oven, takes it to another level. Yes, the service can be slow at times, but so what, it is worth it and I don't go out to dine to be rushed."}
{"text":"Trying this place for the first time, good appetizers we had the hummus and then order some salads nice atmosphere hopefully this place makes it... It's always nice to try new good food."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. I am vegetarian and often look for very good and satisfying salads... Khourys salads are so good. All of them. The lentil soup is yummy and light and they have homemade fresh whole wheat pita bread which is steaming goodness. I am always very pleased after a meal at Khourys"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food with reasonable prices, I had a combination with salad and hummus was great!!
April, the waitress was very professional with lots of smile.
Will definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is calm. Food is delicious. Our seever was Kamiah, and she was amazing. She explained what everything so well. If you haven't tried it... try it now!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. We loved the hummus and chicken. And great service too!  Best homemade pita bread"}
{"text":"Such amazing food....that's why I'll keep coming back.  The staff is super friendly and I always feel like they remember me!  They always know the answers to my vegan questions and allow me to swap walnuts for cheese at no additional charge. Awesome :)  My ONLY complaint is, during lunch, the service has been sooooooo slow lately.  I've noticed they hired a busser, which really helps... And I know everything is made from scratch......but when you're in a hurry, this is a problem.  Especially when you just ordered a vegan salad.  The hefty wine pours make it all ok though ;)"}
{"text":"I'm not qualified to speak to the authenticity of the menu, so I'll stick to what I do know.

Khoury's is a good place for lunch or a light dinner, or for a party of friends who don't mind sharing plates.  Their appetizers and tapas style dishes are their strong suit.  I never did enjoy an entree, here (dry and bland seemed to be a theme).  

The fresh bread is outstanding, and excellent for scooping up hummus, babaganoush, and the cucumber yogurt dish they offer.  

For someone like me, who wants to order one of everything, the bill can get out of hand in a hurry.  But if you're with friends, or at least one similarly minded companion, then the prices (again, for the apps and small plates) are perfectly reasonable.  

Service was always friendly and prompt, though since the bread is fresh from the oven there can sometimes be a wait for more. 

Seating is comfortable, inside or out. They have no problem moving tables around to accommodate parties.  

NOTE: if you have dietary restrictions, you may want to think twice...the servers weren't able to answer our questions re: gluten and nut allergens.  So, if you have a serious allergy, you'll probably want to try and contact the kitchen directly."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and decent prices. Their service seems a bit disorganized, as waitresses did not know whether or not we had been served yet or not, but I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The ambiance is very nice and the outdoor patio is great! The hummus and pita are the best in town and you can't beat the 4 course dinner for two for $40. The food is fresh and flavorful, Greek salad is garnished with their house Greek dressing and the pita comes out piping hot. This is the best Mediterranean restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the waitress are friendly but it seems the owner of this restsutant really wants to go cheap, they are extremeky undet staffed, there was 30 people at the time we visited, only one guy was serving .We waited 35 mins for bread and refill."}
{"text":"Great Lebanese restaurant! I had the feta fries. They are just that, covered in feta and gyro sauce, they are addicting, who needs ketchup anyway. 

Also split the lamb shawarma and Farooj (baked chicken ) with hubby both were delicious. The shawarma came with white rice, onions and pickled veggies. The chicken was baked tender on the inside crispy on the outside served with a piece of broccoli. 

For dessert we shared the rice pudding that was just meh, ok not too sweet and sprinkled with crumbled pistachios."}
{"text":"Can't speak about the food. Was seated and no one ever came back. Guy in a very unfriendly manner said he'd come back to take drink order. After waiting over 15-20 minutes and being ignored, we walked out. Wanted to catch a movie soon next door, and I could tell if I stayed we would get slow and inattentive service. Unfriendly, uncaring staff. At the very least, water should have been brought to us semi quickly on a day 100+ degrees. Was not even very busy to warrant such neglect."}
{"text":"Trying to pick up an Uber Eats to go order and it didn't go well. Arrived within 12 minutes of receiving the alert for pick up. It's been almost an hour and still waiting! One of the employees mentioned they do not like Uber. Not sure why, but if another business helps you get more customers then you should greatly appreciate the extra business!! Another fellow U.E. Driver was also waiting quite a while. I love their food but I will definitely not order to go from Khouris. I could have sat down in the restaurant and ordered the food and received it faster than this. Super disappointed. Not sure I'll even come back to eat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food!  The only reason they don't get another star is because the service is hit & miss.  We visit here about once a week for work luncheons, and I've done dinner many times.  Food quality is always top notch.  The atmosphere is very nice.  Perfect for business lunches or dinners as well as a nice date night.

Definite return customer."}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean! Two friends took me here to welcome me to Las Vegas and glad they did. We had two appetizers - jalapeño hummus and watermelon with feta cheese. The pita was the best I have ever had - freshly baked, piping hot, light and fluffy. I had a lamb shawarma that was to die for."}
{"text":"Love the food options and atmosphere. Service is great also, very accommodating. You wouldn't be disappointed if you stop by for lunch or dinner. The lentil soup is perfect comfort food and full of nutrients.. great for a rainy day or when you feel under the weather. #yum"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. I live close by and will be a regular for sure. Love it !!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant ever since I first came to the old location and now to its new location.  The food is fresh and always the same good quality and extremely delicious.  I live for the lentil soup and I love the fresh baked bread.

I am happy to see that the service has improved and I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to experience delicious Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"My family and friends have come several times to the Sahara location, and everyone loves it. The Gyro sandwich is the best I have ever had, and I have had them in Greece!!!"}
{"text":"We grabbed take-out last night because we just moved and wanted to find a greek place in our area. I was a little underwhelmed, but would be willing to try it again.

For $40 we got a dinner for two, which included an appetizer, soup or salad, entree, and baklava. $40 isn't bad for a sit-down meal, but it is quite pricey for take-out, although we did get a lot of food.

We got the pickle plate for the appetizer, but there were a lot of the pickles on our entree so I wish they would have told us so we could have gotten a different app. My husband got the lentil soup which was good and I got the greek salad. The salad came with a lot of feta which is always a plus and I liked the dressing that came with it.

My husband got a gyro plate and I got a chicken shwarma plate. I was very underwhelmed by my flavorless chicken. I had to dip the chicken in the garlic sauce that we asked for just to give it flavor. I also thought the rice was bland compared to other Mediterranean restaurants. My husband was satisfied with his lamb plate, however. 

The baklava was very tasty, but by far the best part of the dinner was the fresh pita bread that comes with every meal. It was still hot by the time my husband got home and it was fresh and delicious. Overall, just ok, but I would be willing to try it again."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Khoury's has become a regular spot for me and my family and friends. Fresh bread, awesome humus and great tasting dishes makes Khoury's a not to be missed Las Vegas spot. Great spot for lunch during the work week."}
{"text":"We love coming here! The food is consistently good, prices are reasonable and the service is friendly. Oh yeah...and did I mention the bread? It comes hot and fresh from the oven ... YUM!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in all of Las Vegas. My family and I have always had great meals at Kourys. Everything is fresh you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My family and I love Kourys. Its one of the best Mediterranean restaurants in las vegas. When my family comes to Vegas they love to eat at Kourys. The only thing I would recommend to the owner is please, your service is in dire need of some tweeking. It looked like the wait staff all had tables in different areas of the restaurant. Better service please."}
{"text":"I am so frustrated with this place lately. I have been a customer for several years and I have been placing to-go orders lately due to the close proximity to my gym and work. Every single time over the past few months, the order has been late or incorrect. Not once has there been an apology or any attempt to rectify the issue. I love the food at Khoury's, but I'm afraid I'll take my business elsewhere. Hummus Factory up the street on Sahara is amazing. While they also get backed-up, they estimate the correct pick-up time and are always apologetic when they are busy.

Such a shame."}
{"text":"I've dined in a few times and have also ordered out a few times. So obviously I enjoy their menu/food. I haven't tried many Mediterranean joints, so I can't say my opinion should be highly valued. All I know is...I like it! 

I've never been during a lunch or dinner rush, whenever I go I'm only one of four maybe five other diners, so I have no idea why service is always hecka slow. That staff is friendly though :)"}
{"text":"Last night was another exceptional meal at Khoury's! The service was delightful with George as our server. He recognized me and was familiar with some of the items I enjoy without making reference to how he knew. I think he read my last review of the restaurant :) 

The Jalapeño Hummus with warm pita bread was stupendous! It was also 50% off tonight for Yelp check-in patrons. The chicken livers with lentil soup was great - again.

One of the things that caught my attention on this visit, however, was George's offering of a truly authentic Middle Eastern/Lebanese dessert called Kanafi. It is a warm sweet cheese pastry topped with pistachios and honey. It was a prodigious treat, and your palate will thank you."}
{"text":"They close at 10pm which is great! My 2nd time here and so far I am happy with the service and food. They serve their homemade baked bread hot and savory however it turns cold right away. I wonder why. Don't let the bread go cold, eat it right away with a serving of hummus which is creamy and thick. They have a menu dinner for two with appetizer, entree, soup and dessert. It's a fair enough portion not the regular serving. It was our best choice. I tasted the beef and rice soup and it's unappealing, I prefer the lentil soup. 

The chicken kabob was satisfying. It wasn't dry. The rice was just perfect I was surprised that I even though I was hungry and the food was delicious, I still didn't finish my plate. I guess I got full right away. The 2 skewer kabob filled my empty stomach. My son always love the Gyro sandwich. I asked for some chili sauce and they gave me a fresh minced jalapeño and it's quite spicy. I enjoyed it with my chicken kabob."}
{"text":"I come back again and again! Food is fresh and made to order. The pita is made fresh constantly and it is brought fresh and hot to the table. Delicious!
I recommend the wraps and grape leaves!
The service is friendly as well. 
(Fries are also some of the best I've had)
I will return again and again!
Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. 
I work at a salon close by and we order at least once a week. 
The service is lovely and the food is great! 
Greek salad with chicken and hummus is wonderful. 
Go try it out!"}
{"text":"I've been a loyal Khoureys customer since the old location on warm springs since they opened. 

The food is consistently good and the service whether you dine in or take out is exceptional. 
The hot pita bread, hummus, chicken shawarma and kabobs are among my favorites and all are  delicious. 

I've turned my entire family onto to khoureys and whenever we crave middle eastern food this is where we go. Compared to many other Middle Eastern restaurants in town you without a doubt get more food for your money. For example the kabob meal comes with 3 kabobs, salad or soup and rice! The portions are not small and the quality is the best you can find in any restaurant. 

I visit here at least a few times a month and I will continue to return. 
Thank you Khoureys for bring quality Mediterranean food to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my second lunch visit to Khoury's. I loved the gyro and jalapeño hummus! Comfortable, casual environment. Our service was very good. 

Also, I shared a pitcher of red sangria with friends on my first visit...definitely a great addition to lunch with friends!"}
{"text":"Do you love Mediterranean food? 
Do you love a good atmosphere?
Do you love piping hot pita bread that is served with a little EVOO and spice? Better yet- it's on the house?

Do yourself a favor and come here, this place is the gem I have been searching for. Ever since I traveled throughout the Middle East, Shwarma, Hummus and everything in between are my food life. Finding Khoury's off of Sahara completed what has been missing in my life!"}
{"text":"Just horrible service. Server was very inexperienced and you could tell he had no idea how any of the food was prepared. He gave us the check before even asking if we wanted dessert. Then he forgot about us. 
-
They ran out of vegetarian moussaka. It's a Thursday @ 6pm. We told the server 2 of the party were vegetarian and he asked when taking new order if they wanted meat with it. Really? Listen to your customers. 
-
Drive the 1.6 miles and eat at Paymon's!"}
{"text":"Best mediterranean resto in town.. From their soft hot pita bread to the beef kabob. Prices are in the highs but the food is good. Good eats people.. Good eats."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I have had in all of las vegas. They have the best hummus, fresh made to order pita bread, falafel and really good fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"One word... Delicious .  Had the tabuleh which is my favorite. I also ordered the chiken kabob. Now this is a meal to remember. It beats a hamburger anyday. If your looking for the ultimate midfle eatern experience. You must try Khoury's."}
{"text":"Got the Sujuk (Spicy Beef Sausage). It's very good and spicy. 
Supporting the local business. Family owned and operated ."}
{"text":"Always come to Khoury's with a girlfriend at least once a week...sometimes twice! We always come during happy hour for the half price appetizers....the jalapeño hummus and feta fries are the bomb! The piping hot, fresh pita bread is to die for...love it dipped in the herb & olive oil they serve. My husband loves the stuffed cabbage and the kabobs are always delish!! I can't tell you how many friends I've gotten hooked on this place!  Just kinda bummed they're moving locations....Ft. Apache spot was so convenient."}
{"text":"My favorites place EVER! The food is fabulous, the fresh, hot pita bread is HEAVEN!!  Love the olive oil and spices for the bread...I could go on & on..but really...you must go and try it. EVERYONE I bring here falls in love! Promise!"}
{"text":"Went and tried this place yesterday and truth to be told it wasn't a good experience at all. From food being too oily to wait staff service that kept forgetting what we ordered. Majority of our food was left uneaten as none of though it tasted good. Definitely won't be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. These nice people are so rude and so self obsessed. We sat for 10 minutes and didn't even have 1 person come ask us if we even needed water. The food might be good, but is it really worth having a bad service experience??? Horrible service will never go back."}
{"text":"We wanted to eat Mediterranean food so we decided to stop by at this place to eat. 
The salads were very good. The combination meat dish was not tasty at all. 
The overall: the place look very cozy and nice. The patio looks great. The food is so so. The prices are very very very high compare other restaurants and I can not say that the food was delicious. 

Maybe we will stop by again and try some more food."}
{"text":"Freshly baked bread, Mezza combination is awesome. I came to eat Kibbeh Nyayyeh, unfortunately it's not good and definitely the portion is so small it's not worth $28. It wasn't grounded and spiced good. For Kibbeh Nayyeh lovers don't order it ,you'll be disappointed. They have a clean place warm decor, however I find it over priced."}
{"text":"so far Khourys is my all time favorite mediterranean restaurant. My wife and i go here for valentines, birthdays, and get togethers with our friends. The service has always been generous and accomodating. Prices are a bit high, but you definitely get what you pay for... If i want something good and exotic, i definetly will always choose khourys."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food but I'm not sure this is a place I'd rush back to- it's a bit overpriced, for one. Experience with sandwiches/wraps has been dismal, but salads are gigantic- too bad this is one of those places that think a heap of lettuce should justifiably cost $10 before adding on a protein for an additional $5. 

The pita bread here is amazing. But the lamb shwarma wrap is wrapped in some other sort of homemade bread that is similar to a tortilla- only crappy. Maybe it's their version of laffa, I don't know. Either way, it wasn't great.
Also, the flavors inside the wrap did not go well together: choice of lamb or chicken, plus tomatoes, onions, pickles, and tahini. I did not care for their tahini and the pickles and lamb flavors clashed horribly, plus the lamb itself was dry. Would imagine getting this with chicken would be several times better.

Interior is nicely decorated for a dinner date, service was not noteworthy (other than being slow), glad they have parking dedicated specifically for takeout customers. Maybe the mezza are the way to go..."}
{"text":"Freezes burned gyros and soggy fries delivered by poor service.  Take a pass!
 
A friend and I stopped into Khoury's for lunch.  Big mistake!  We ordered gyros and fries and were super disappointed when our food arrived.  It was cold, the gyro meat was clearly pressed out and formed instead of sliced as we would have expected. To make things worse the gyros tasted like it was microwaved.  We left the food uneaten. It just wasn't worth it.

To make matters worse the service was poor and the prices were high.  Do yourself a favor and go through the drive through somewhere."}
{"text":"I come here very often! I'm obsessed with the food. I usually do take out because the in dining experience is sometimes slow. Very consistent with there food, and delicious."}
{"text":"An update to my last Khoury's review.A complete turn around the place is fantastic upon entering you are greeted and seated.The whole place is like a beautiful room,it is clean,bright and all the tables are set up perfectly(Iwish my hospital was this clean).Service is spot on,no waiting,the food was presented in a fine establishment manner.The food is over the top good.A good place to impress out of town company.The owner has a good thing going due to their knowledge and treating customers as royalty.Thank you for having a great dining experience available to your customers."}
{"text":"Good effort and nice touches.    Had the dinner for two deal.   Chicken kabob was good but the stuffed cabbage failed short. Greek Salas and lentil soup also good as was the custard desert
Service was OK."}
{"text":"I have been to Khourys at their first restaurant in the Southwest and now they are at their new location in Sahara. They stay true to their Lebanese food. So delicious! I always get the beef kabobs, sometimes  chicken . My husband loves their lamb dishes. Tonight he ate the stuffed cabbage. They have a really good \"date night\" menu that comes with appetizers, salads, main dish and dessert for $45. You can't go wrong! And the stone oven pita bread  you'll just keep asking for more. Tonight we were honored to be serviced by one of the family members/owner of Khourys. When you have a family owned restaurant and can keep cooking consistently then you will have customers that will drive far to eat there! The service is spot on. They are always walking the floor. Thank you for another beautiful evening! Took home more baklava, couldn't stop eating!"}
{"text":"The FRESH Pita is Amazing, 
and the rest of the food is actually pretty good too... 

Had it been as good as \"Byblos\" in Tempe, Arizona... 
or as good as my mom's, i would've rated it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. From plain flat soda, to less than ordinary lentil soup, not so good pita bread, and to serving chicken going bad!!!! The food was old and tasted bad. As soon as I tried my chicken shewarma plate I noticed the taste of chicken going bad. I know what it tastes like because I have eaten it before. The waitress just said I am not used to Mediterranean food. Mediterranean food is one of my favorites! - anyways I do not recommend this place AT ALL. No restaurant should serve old food ever!"}
{"text":"My husband had the Chicken Kabobs and I had the Kafta.  Both were great.  The issue here was the wine.  I ordered a glass of Clos du Bois Chard but was served the house Glen Ellen.  After tasting it, I sent it back and the waitress brought me the Clos du Bois.  Then, at the bar, I saw them POUR MY GLASS OF HOUSE WINE BACK INTO THE GLEN ELLEN BOTTLE!
 Not sure what they were thinking.  I had to taste it to realize it was the wrong wine.  Health Department violation for sure.  Not headed back to this place, no matter how much we enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"This is the best Lebanese food in Las Vegas. I am from Ottawa, Canada which has the largest population of Lebanese people outside of Lebanon.  I've eaten a lot of Lebanese food in  my life and it's my favourite kind.  My only complaint is their system doesn't always seem to sync up - I order from them at least once a week and although I always ask for no pickles on my chicken shawarma half the time it come with pickles. Even if the box has writing on it saying no pickles! I also regularly ask for a side of garlic sauce and again 50/50 if that happens. Not the end of the world even with these issues there is no where better for this food in the city."}
{"text":"The Greek salads are the best.  I'm a gluten free eater and I enjoy a lot of Mediterranean foods without the bread.  This place is nice, has out door setting, can be packed sometimes.  Personally i order to go most of the time so its not an issue, but there must be a reason that it gets busy there.  i also like the tabuoli (not sure how to spell it).  The only tiny grip that i have, is that i personally think its a little over priced.  i have eaten at other Mediterranean place that were almost just as good but the price was much cheaper.  I do get that its a business and they are located in a better part of town which means more over head so it doesn't stop me form enjoying and being a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Consistently great food, great service an easy to get in and out. This has quickly become a regular place for us to done and meet friends for lunch AND dinner."}
{"text":"3 strikes out as they say.. 

Not coming back until they get their act together. In my opinion , the place, needs better management.  This was the last chance I am giving this place and had no choice but to walk out again.  4  unclean tables outside and we wait for 10 minutes without water service.. 

I gave this place another chance after the previous 2 \"not so great\" experiences..  I waited at the counter for 10 minutes and no one paid attention. The servers were all in the kitchen and one of them saw me and chose to ignore me. I walked out...The previous time, it was a takeaway order which was completely messed up..

I know the place can do better with good service... I wish them luck!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch with my husband a few weeks ago & had one of the best Lebanese meals since I moved to vegas from L.A! 
The sangria was surprisingly phenomenal & the stuffed grape leaves were equally delicious with the exception that they didn't come with the traditional yogurt. 
Coming back as soon as I can."}
{"text":"If you're looking for delicious, authentic Mediterranean food..this is your place. We ordered the spinach fatayer and baba ghanoush. For dinner we had the grape leaves and hummus plate with meat on top. It was way too much food, i don't know what we were thinking but it felt so good to finally have Lebanese food the way it is supposed to taste. The knafa was good, but nowhere near some of the best I've had. I would skip this if you're a picky knafa person like I am. The waitress was very sweet and the overall vibes were good. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. My husband and I had the Filet mignon kebabs. Very tender and for dessert we had Shabie delicious. Our second time here, love it great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mediterranean / Lebanese restaurant in all of Las Vegas!! I love this restaurant. EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"I am extremely patient but we were treated like crap. There was ZERO RECOVERY PERFORMED BY THE MANAGER. ZERO SERVICE.  

So the one star is because the food is good. I usually order to go and never had a problem. Today I went in with my coworkers to sit down and have lunch. We arrived a couple minutes before noon and were sat in the corner behind the liquor rack. We waited for about 10 mins before anyone came
Over and gave us any service, honestly it didn't bother me bc its not that big deal at first. I assume once the service will start that it should be fine. The busser took our drink order and several minutes later a server named George came over and took our order. They have lunch specials and the restaurant is filled with other corporate customers who have about an hour lunch like us. There is a  large table in front who seated AFTER US (and not just a couple minutes, like 10 minutes).
Anyways around 12:25 the large table gets their food and we still don't have appetizers. Around 12:37 I ask the manager of they know how much longer for the food bc we will be leaving shortly. 
The whole thing is a mess. No one really helps us or apologies for the wait time except for the busser, AND IT WAS NOT HIS FAULT AT ALL!  At 12:45 I ask for my check and I need to leave. That's a horrible mess, mind you I  STILL NO FOOD. We have to ask the manager who is in front of me to help me, as she is ignoring me... I MEAN THIS WAS EPICALLY BAD. We ran out of drinks, bread for our hummus/yogurt sauce which we got 30 mins into service. Waited 10 mins to be served. WE WERE TREATED HORRIBLY."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. There was not one thing we tried that we didn't like. The baba ganoush was probably the best I've tried yet. The food was fresh, delicious and quick and the service was awesome. Coming from New York where there are hundreds of Mediterranean restaurants, we were worried that we wouldn't find a good place but this definitely was up there. We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent service and entree was delicious! Very impressed with the generous servings. Will definitely stop by for dinner since we loved the lunch so much."}
{"text":"I can say that food was good, but the service was terrible. We have been waiting for the food for one hour. The food came cold and took forever. Service and management didn't do anything with that, even didn't say sorry. Wouldn't come back to that restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was good the food was good, likes the shawarma a lot. The fresh pitas were very tasty. Please looks clean and the outside patio has a great vibe with good Mediterranean music"}
{"text":"Really the very best Mediterranean food you can get in Vegas. The food and atmosphere were beyond our expectations. This is our new go to spot for Shawarma. Awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great atmosphere. I am from Cali and tried this place based on a recommendation from a friend.  The food is fresh and they even make their pita bread from scratch and in the brick fire oven. I would recommend the soujak pizza!  It is definitely on point. Their sandwich wraps are also very good. It is a little pricey but definitely worth the high quality they provide. Can't wait to come back. Hopefully next time I save room for dessert!!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot way enough about how awesome Khoury's is. After both lunch and dinner I can confirm that the food is amazing and the staff delightful. Things not to be missed: any kebab, the fries (seriously - so so good), falafel gyro, grape leaves . . . this is pretty much everything I tried. And it was all delish. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the delivery ordering process was way too complicated. I tried ordering the Yelp...full menu not available. Tried ordering through the Khoury's website, couldn't add notes. Called the restaurant, was told for delivery it had to be ordered online. All in all, food was good but 20 minutes wasted to place the order was frustrating."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food! Great service! The servers are very sweet and attentive, April and Fanie are very nice and super hard working! Their bread omg!"}
{"text":"A first time dining experience at Khoury's, but it won't be the last time. The mint tea and pita bread were welcome starters. The baba ganoush appetizer was superb, as was the lentil soup.The lamb with hummus was very nicely done as well. It was a good amount for a lunch item. Our server, Kymiah, was amazing, superb and flawless. She greeted us with a smile, was very attentive, conscientious and highly professional from start to finish while busy working other tables. It goes a long way when an establishment has employees like her. All I know is, there were a lot of flavors to go along with the perfectly prepared food. Kudos to the kitchen and owners. Well done! (The only reason I did not give 5 stars was due to the fact that there were a number of tables that were not cleared off after the diners were long gone. Half eaten food sitting on tables is not an appetizing sight)."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in town by far.  I love Arabic food and this place make everything fresh including the bread. As soon a new costumer walks in they already put the bread for them in the brick oven,  soooo good! I order all the fixes I love and the my favorite, lamb chops! It's homemade food.
Plus the service is phenomenal! Love it!"}
{"text":"Came in to have lunch by myself.. Stood by the door for a few min waiting to get seated. The staff just looked at me and didn't even acknowledge me. I had to walk up to someone and ask if she was seating people and she replies back \"sorry, I didn't see you.\" I made eye contact with her twice, and on top of that I was wearing bright mint colored pants.. lol! I can't stand horrible service like this, I walked out."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and I already can't wait to come back. We had the jalepeno hummus which came with fresh,  hot pita bread. The shrimp scampi had exceptional flavor.  And the mint lemonade was so refreshing.  I can't wait to come here for happy hour! Service was also great. Lana made the lunch very enjoyable"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great food. The jalapeño hummus was amazing. I'll be back soon for some more."}
{"text":"Nothing more to say that I didn't say last time, still 5 stars. Wait... I may have fibbed. They were definitely not prepared for how busy they were for Mother's Day. We got there about 5 mins before my reservation time in which I made early in the week without any problem and they didn't have it ready when we arrived and looked as though they didn't even have it documented BUT the two servers at the front were VERY fast to pull together a couple tables get it set up and have us seated almost immediately so no harm done at all. Dounya(I think that was her name) was the sweetest, very attentive, and super accommodating to my little ones. You could tell they could've used a couple hands as we waited a bit for her to come around and what not but it definitely wasn't her slacking; again total disclosure it was Mother's Day at 6:00 and it would not discourage me from showing up there for dinner at the slightest. Their food is so fresh, it's  good quality and absolutely delicious! Thanks again Khourys for an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Uh-maze-zing!! When it comes to authentic Mediterranean food, this is the place! The ambience is great to cater to any event.. from a casual day out, to a romantic dinner or a big celebration. The homemade warm fluffy bread comes straight out of the fire brick oven and it is just right to warm up your taste buds for what's to come. Every menu item is absolutely delicious from the appetizers to the main entrees. The chicken farooj is so heavenly I'm a chicken piccata fan so I don't know how I'm ever gonna appreciate any other place that serves it after trying it here! It was the perfect combination of garlic, lemon and seasonings..every bite was full of flavor. You also have to try the MINT LEMONADE (I was hesitant at first) but I'm so happy I tried it! It was sooooo divine! From the flawless service (thank you to our server Lana) to an amazing dinner experience, hats off to both the chef and server"}
{"text":"Truly the best Mediterranean food I've had in Vegas. This is a new family favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"Bread was bomb, appetizers were bomb, main course was bomb, desert was bomb, AND service was bomb, everything was BOMB!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. If you like having proper service when dining out, do not go there. Unprofessional staff. It seems like it is their first time working as servers."}
{"text":"This place is tops! Khoury's recently moved across town and are now dangerously convenient for me. The location is nice and relaxed, with patio seating and a chill vibe- great weekend lunch spot.

The salads are my usual pick here, $10 each but huge and loaded with toppings. The Greek with shrimp (+$4) and the Mediterranean Garbanzo (add lamb, or not) are my favorites. 

Their lunch specials are well priced: $10 for a small entree (my guy likes the stuffed cabbage rolls) with a choice of side (their hummus is great!) and pita bread. Their bread is noteworthy because it's made fresh in house, super-soft and chewy. 

Service is polite, call in your order if you're in a rush, and snag a loyalty card: spend enough and you'll get a $10 credit. Shirts, spice blends, and some small gifts available for purchase at the hostess stand."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Pita is hot and fluffy, food is fresh! Service was good, after us several parties walked in and one server was one floor, which soon turned in to two. It seems like a trend at Mediterranean restaurants that service lacks. They were very friendly and somewhat attentive. What appeared to be the owners little kid was milling around the restaurant - which no one wants to deal with on a relaxing night out. Definitely going back - food is great."}
{"text":"Meh... Overall disappointing. Food was good but over priced and not enough. I don't mind paying more for good quality food but when you skimp in the portions I feel liked I got cheated. Kabobs were good but not enough meat. Barely four little pieces of meat on each skewer. Gyro meat entree however had a good portion of meat and was delicious. I've been a loyal customer for years at their original location but when they moved it's no longer convenient for me. I've been craving Khoury's hummus so I did the extra drive to get some take out last night. They don't appear to have the full menu on yelp so I decided to call it in. I was trying to order over the phone on the drive over however the girl taking my order was of no help and it seemed like I couldn't get my questions about the menu answered. I ended up ordering upon my arrival (which could have saved 20 minutes). She then told me that I was her last order (9:30p on a Saturday night when they close at 10p) and that she should have been off 45 mins ago. I laughed but in my head thinking why would you ever tell the customer this? I still tipped about 15% but then realized she left and never even finished the order. One if the other waitresses put my To Go order together, double checked everything and even made sure the bread was hot. I wish she would have got the tip. Maybe the new location has extra overhead but please don't skimp on the portions when you're already priced higher than competitors."}
{"text":"So good!! One of the best Mediterranean restaurants I've ever been too. The kabobs are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my son for the first time for a late lunch today. Excellent food, service and atmosphere. We will be back and treat my wife to it. I had the lamb gyro with fries, my son had the Lahm Bi Ajeen. We split the hummus with the fresh baked puff bread. All excellent."}
{"text":"Ok. So I had khourys about 6 years ago and the shawarma are yummy! With that being said the rest of the food is not authentic Lebanese food at all. The zaatar is tasteless and The pita is ok. It's Americanized and not that great. Do that's why I'm giving it 3 stars. I have to say George has great service!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. This restaurant is authentic Lebanese. The menu has many choices and everything is explained. We ordered the dinner for 2 and it was a great selection of choices and a lot of goods for the price. The pita bread is fresh baked on site, and the babaganoush was great. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is always good. However, the service has not been. The wait is too long. It seems like they are always under staff and need a manager to make sure things are organized. We are so happy that they moved closer but always have to wait. Hope they get some help soon!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some type of Middle Eastern food so we tried Khoury's....Awesome food and wine. We had the Lamb Chops and the baked Chicken Faroosh. Everything was spot on as well as the service. Will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Lastnight was the first time of going to this restaurant. It was recommended to me by a friend. My cousin was craving good Mediterranean food, so I was like why not. As we entered the restaurant was quaint and looked presentable. We stood by the hostess station for a few minutes, the lady in a white shirt noticed us but ignored us and continued to help the seated guests. Then finally a nice woman in a black shirt asked if we were helped and handed us a menu. After looking through the menu my cousin finally decided on what she wanted. So the woman in the black shirt took us to the cashier area to take our order. While she was taking our order, the lady in the white shirt (she wore glasses , on the hefty side, and have glasses) was so rude and didn't even say excuse me and told her to stop checking us out because she 'doesn't like for her customers to wait for a check'... In my head I was like what are we?? And then she was rude and pushed that girl to the side after she voided our order and the woman in black told her \"she's ordering\" and the lady in the white shirt was so rude and talked down to her and us and said \"well she doesn't care. I think she doesn't care! What I say goes...\" So from that comment I knew immediately she was either an owner or a manager. 

After that experience, the woman in the black shirt was nice and pulled us a chair. While we were sitting there all she did was whine and complain. My ears were literally hurting from her negative behavior.   I have never experienced such verbal abuse to other employees and to waiting customers. I honestly think the woman in the white shirt was racist, only helped people that were blonde or looked Caucasian. She seemed to treat the people with background that is different of her own with such distaste. After that we got home and glad we didn't have to sit through being around her negative aura. 

 I can't believe I gave them a 1 star but I did because there was no other option. The food was mediocre. Kudos to the women who wore black t-shirts and have to deal with the woman in the white shirt every time they work there."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch for lunch with a friend and the food was good.  I ordered the chicken kabob plate with rice & salad.  The chicken wasn't dry and had a great flavor.  The rice was delicious.  However, the service was horribly slow!  It took forever for our server to come and ask for our drink order and then another 10 minutes or more to take our food order.  The restaurant was pretty empty, as we came in at the end of the lunch hour so it wasn't because they were so busy.  I had to remind her twice to refill my drink!  I'm so glad we paid with cash because it may have been another 30 minutes to ring up a credit card.  Good service is important to me and with the kind of service I had there I will not be back.  I can get good Mediterranean food elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Skinny: great pita bread and hummus, everything else is not so great (3), solid service (2).

Khoury's is a Mediterranean restaurant tucked away in a strip mall close to Southern Hills Hospital.

We started with an appy of hummus and freshly made pita. This was a delight. Really, half of it is the show of watching the pita lady knead the dough and place it in the woodburning oven. My only gripe is the serving size for hummus is a little small for $6. However, this appetizer alone is worth the trip.

I ordered the Khoury's Salad with Chicken and my hubby ordered the gyros plate. (I wanted to try the moussaka but they were out.)

The salad was okay - the vegetables were great but there was an overabundance of a bland dressing. The chicken itself was singularly uninteresting. It was cut so small that when cooked, it left the meat too dry. I was expecting something similar to chicken from a kabob placed on top of the salad but I have no idea how they cooked this.

My hubby's gyros was ok - the gyros meat was well seasoned. However, the problem lay in the tzatziki sauce. The yogurt was not strained enough, leaving the dressing a little thin for my taste. I also prefer a little more garlic in my tzatziki. The fries served with the sandwiches are homemade - good but not great.

Normally, a place like this would get only maybe a 2.5 from me, but the pita bread really put this place over the top. Maybe I ought to have tried a pizza instead."}
{"text":"What is up at this place....when owners were here, it was great....now inattentive and rude help, burnt food with no replacement and waiters too young and uninvolved....must be related to still be employed....stay away until you see actual Greek people working here. Maybe then some pride will be here"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat! The flavors are wonderful and the service was great. I went with four other people and we all shared dishes. Four of us got the dinner for two. And the other got their own dish. You will NOT leave this place hungry. You will be extremely full!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! Unbelievable portions and the service was very friendly. I have been to many middle eastern restaurants and I would have to say this is one of the best. Today was my first visit but it sure won't be my last."}
{"text":"Our dinner here was the sort of solid experience where, perhaps with the menu in the hands of different people with different tastes, it may be worth bumping Khoury up a star. I would call it \"a three with subjective potential.\"

We sat indoors where the tables are covered with paper, but tastefully so. (I thought the owners were just being extra clean; then I saw the pile of bones left on the table by the people behind us. Ah!) Most of the tables inside allow for an attractive view of the brick oven where the pita is made.

We started with the falafel appetizer, a genuine highlight, although - ironically - the falafel themselves weren't so amazing. I prefer falafel that are cooked to a light crisp, but most places seem to serve falafel pretty well done, so no surprise that ours were this way. What was delicious were the picture-perfect chopped vegetables filling the rest of the plate. We both liked the pickles, and I actually liked the Kalamatas, which are normally my least fave olive. These Kalamatas were only slightly bitter with a nice tang. The big surprise, though, were the pickled beets: very crispy and sour. A lot more \"oomph!\" than the pickled beets of my past. (Of which there have been, um, two? So I'm not an expert, but these were really satisfying.)

Mike ordered a soda, which was always replenished as needed without any waiting. I asked if they had lemonade. The waitress said they did, and that it was freshly squeezed. Count me in! What she neglected to mention was that it was the very best lemonade ever served west of I-15... maybe even west of the Appalachians. It was terrific. 

Of course, the lemonade wasn't subject to refills, so when - despite my attempts to nurse it all the way through - I emptied my glass during the meal I decided that *if* the waitress asked, I would splurge and have another, whatever the price may be. (It wasn't on the menu.) Otherwise, I would take it as a sign to stay frugal.

Well, she didn't ask, and when we got the bill I was glad. Eight dollars for two lemonades wouldn't really be in line with this particular dining experience. As for the rest of Khoury's pricing, it's difficult to judge. Many items are pretty reasonable compared to similar places, but some prices seem high for what you get. Like, my husband ordered the \"Meat Combination\" for $19, and what he got on his plate would've run perhaps half that in most other casual moderate places.

I ordered the lentil soup because of the description on the menu. The soup had a pleasant, pebbly texture and was obviously prepared with care, nut I also thought it was bland. This is where personal tastes may come in. I'm used to spicy (Indian) lentil soups, and of course it isn't fair to judge a Mediterranean restaurant by those standards. 

For the main course I was embarrassingly unimaginative and got... garlic pizza. Do you hear that thud as I hang my head in shame? I was really craving a salad, maybe the fatoush which I've had elsewhere and loved, but the salads are all entree-sized, and I was also craving something heavier for the main dish. (I never have good luck with taking leftover leafy salad home for later once it's been dressed.) A half-salad (at half-price) would've solved my problem. I did eye someone else's salad, though, and it looked great. Oh well. I only look like I have the stomach for all these things... :)

The garlic pizza, whose copy claims that \"you will need mints after this,\" was decent enough. I did appreciate that they weren't lying about the amount of garlic. Again, though, I think it just wasn't my thing. The pita crust was a nice change but not something I need to have twice.

Speaking of pita, before the meal we were served fresh pita in a basket, the bread so hot we couldn't touch it. (That's not a complaint.) Miss Noob here had never seen pita when it's spherical; I've only ever seen it in its pocket form. It was served with an olive oil and thyme mixture, which - as inviting as it sounds - was pretty flavourless, alas. But the pita itself was good. But then, warm bread is usually a sure thumbs-up from me.

Mike thought his meat plate was okay, but like me, he was left wondering how much of the food was \"meh\" and how much was just him.

I don't think Khoury's will let you down, but how much they lift you up just depends on what you like. If we go back, it will be at lunch prices."}
{"text":"The hostess wasn't' the friendliest ever, but the waitress was super kind.  The food was very good.  When it comes to kibbeh, you can get a really varied presentation.  I got the grilled kibbeh and it was pretty good.  It is not served in the \"football\" style where it's covered in breading and fried though the menu says you can request fried.  I'm used to flat made in a pan kibbeh and this was kind of close.  The rice was good, the kabobs are really delicious, and I appreciate that they have meat dolmas, not just vegetarian.  Food was delicious, portions were generous, waitress was kind, and price wasn't too bad.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  It took a while to get service at the beginning but service was good after that.  The hummus was pretty tasty as was the garlic mint yogurt.  The pita was ok.  I like that the pita comes out warm, but it has strange wheat taste to it that I'm not used to with pita.  And it does get crunchy fast.

They were out of moussaka, one of my favorite dishes, so I tried the stuffed cabbage.  It was ok.  Cabbage leaves stuffed with rice and meat, then cooked and covered with roasted garlic.  I couldn't finish it all.  The texture was a little offputting.  Very watery dish.  

My husband had the meat combination.  The meatball that comes with it is pretty good but everything else was a little dry.  The meat combination comes with rice and that part was very, very good.  They offer tzatziki and tahini on the side with entrees so take advantage of that.  The tzatziki went well with the meat.

I like that they offer Lebanese and Moroccan beers.  It's nice to try something different.  Also, they have a full bar and a lot of creative drinks.  But there are a lot of restaurants to try in this part of town.  I will likely try a different restaurant or go to DW Bistro when I am back in this part of town again."}
{"text":"Food is solid everytime we come here! I love the raw kibbee, house mezza, the fresh piping hot bread the fattoush salad & garlic sauce!!!!"}
{"text":"Best place for middle eastern food in Vegas so far. And I am sure about it cause I've tried several places cause this is too far from where I live and somehow I just have to come back here. Food and service always good and love the fresh pita."}
{"text":"Great food, strong sangria!  We went here tonight for dinner. You can't go wrong with the four course meal for two.  You get a lot of food for $39.99. The bad side, the service was extremely slow. The waitress was very friendly,  but again, very slow.
All in all a good experience for the food and sangria alone."}
{"text":"A group of us came here for lunch.  The food was delicious.  We started off with the large hummus and warm pita bread.  That appetizer is a must.  A few people had the greek salad with gyro meat.  I had the chicken kabobs and others had the gyro sandwich with fries.  My kabobs were outstanding and everyone enjoyed there food too.  The service was a little slow, but I will excuse it since the place was full of people."}
{"text":"My second time to this restaurant. Must say, I love their Pita Bread! Brought out nice and steamy hot, complimentary when you order an entree. Our server was nice but not super efficient. For food, I ordered the meat grape leaves, which was good, but more tart than expected. Good thing I saved some pita bread to eat with it, which makes it much better. Tried the Kanafi for dessert and I cannot make up my mind if I like it or not... it's definitely different than a traditional dessert like cake or pastry. Overall, this place isn't bad, it is good to try Lebanese cuisine, but with so many amazing food options in the area, I don't know that I'd come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Middle Eastern places! I've been going to Khoury's for a few years now and it is consistently delicious every time. The fresh baked pita bread is amazing on its own but definitely try the hummus! All the dishes have that family recipe taste that you can't just get at any restaurant. The stuffed cabbage even beats my family recipe (sorry grandma). All in all check this place out if you haven't already! AMAZING food, good vibes, authentic decor and the staff is always so kind and attentive.

Keep up the good work Khoury's!"}
{"text":"So far, I would have to say this is my favorite Mediterranean food place. I've been to market grille and I like it but something about this place was more authentic. I only ordered the hummus with pita and pita chips, but my god it was delicious ! It really exceeded my expectations. Everything was fresh and hot and I just left with a warm and full feeling in my stomach. Can't wait to explore more of the menu"}
{"text":"so Khoury made yelp remove my review. I'm not sure if they paid them to but following the guidelines I'll repost: i saw that they just opened this restaurant so i came in for a carryout order, a server tells me she'll be right with me. so I said ok and took a menu to look at while I wait. another guest comes in right after me but she turns around and actually comes to him first with what he needs help with... there were 2 servers and 4 tables in total. I still waited since they seemed busy.... But ignoring me for another 12 minutes after that with no interest in even looking at me. I walked out. I wanted to give them a try but I felt discriminated and unwelcomed."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious!!! The best Mediterranean food I've had in Vegas so far. Everything is so tasty and spices are just right. I love their hummus, fresh bread, and tilapia kabobs. Their servings are a pretty good size too (which is a plus for me because I can have leftovers later). Pricing is not bad either. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"After having read many of the reviews here I figured I would add my opinion and experiences to the list.  My wife and I started coming here after we found that with her Las Vegas Athletic Club membership card, we get 15% the bill.  We LOVE it.  We have eaten here probably 10 or 15 times in the last 6 months.  

The pita bread that they bake there is divine.  It is soft and flavorful and the oil and spice blend the bring to dip it in is excellent.  The hummous is fantastic, especially when they put some chickpeas on top.  It is not overly oily or super dry.  We also enjoy getting the mezza platter, which is basically a little bit of all their appetizers, and we often each that as dinner for the two of us.  The lentil soup is also very good, although getting a cup is pointless, as a bowl is $1 more and is about 3 times bigger.  I LOVE kibbi, and get it everytime as an entree, as it is tasty and filling.  I have brought a few friends here and all of them have told me they continue to return on a regular basis.  

As for slow and rude service that some have mentioned.  What restaurant are you going to?  Having eaten here around a dozen times, I have never had a rude waitress or unusually slow service.  Never.  One time I did see a teenage boy back near the kitchen in the restaurant, but I did not see him waiting tables.  They do have some items that are decidedly un-Lebanese, like pizza, but most restaurants of this type I have seen often have things for more Americanized palates.  I find the portions to be more than adequate and my wife and I usually leave STUFFED for around $35-40 with tip.  She often comments that she enjoys the food a great deal because it just tastes \"fresh\" and feels healthy, calories and such aside.  Overall, one of places we frequent the most now, and the fact that it is on Opentable is nice, so I get points just for making reservations."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service! We waited about 15-20 minutes for the waitress to take our order while she helped everyone else in the restaurant. The bus boy was doing nothing and my mom was starving so I flagged him down for bread since the wait for our order was taking so long. I ordered lentil soup and the eggplant appetizer and was disappointed in both. Both were bland and meh. I will never come back due to poor service and food."}
{"text":"What a let down...  The meal started off great with some awesome jalapeno hummus and puffy table bread for appetizer.  I ordered the Salmon as the entree, and when it arrived to the table it looked incredible, but upon taking the first bite I was surprised to find out it was frozen and not fresh salmon.  For anyone who eats fish, the difference between frozen and fresh fish is night and day.  It was dry, hard, and just awful.  The waiter came over and asked how everything was.  I told him I cant believe for this price, you would serve frozen fish.  His reply was.... Yes, the fish here is frozen.  So def won't be coming back to this low quality spot ever again.  $17 for frozen fish is a joke."}
{"text":"First thought- freshly baked pita from their brick oven, yum! The food was excellent from the hummus to the chicken kebab sandwich. We finally found a Mediterranean restaurant in Vegas that serves authentic dishes that taste amazing but, most importantly they have great garlic sauce. 
Slap that garlic sauce on everything if you love garlic."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I eat here quite often.  The Farooj is awesome, and is big enough to be eaten by two especially if you get an appetizer ."}
{"text":"I eat at Khoury's all the time!! Best food ever. I love the Greek salad & I love the vibe of the restaurant. Anytime someone asks me for a great Greek/Mediterranean restaurant, Khoury's is always at the top of my list!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean joint in the city. Great Morrocan atmosphere (or is it Lebanese... I don't care.... I feel like I am in their country). I LOVE the pita bread; freshly baked and hot at the table. The wait staff could use some better service skills. And I'd like to see an actual person from Lebenon in the kitchen ;-)

An occasional happy hour or dinner special would be great, then I could come by every day versus once a few weeks."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the food here...super duper fresh! Will return soon! Ordered the jalapeño hummus, the meat combination platter and one of there pizzas... Everything was exquisite!"}
{"text":"Love shawarma, sooo good with extra garlic sauce. Food was excellent. My friends & I went their after a massage. Salad was fresh too. Love the bread & humus. Servers were so nice. 
I miss the food . We are all out of towners"}
{"text":"The food is ok but the service is questionnable every time. Tonight sealed the deal and I will not be going back there anymore.  When we walked in, the hostess told us there were three parties ahead of us. When it was our turn to be seated, she passed us up and seated a couple that had just walked in (who appeared to be her friends).
The owner should consider hiring someone who has experience running a restaurant because as it stands, this place is unprofessional and the service is horrible."}
{"text":"This quaint, charming restaurant gets my vote for the most awkward, slow as molasses service ever. They are seriously understaffed. I'm guessing one of the servers called out for whatever reason but one server and one hostess or busser for the whole restaurant on a weekend?! It took forever for everything. Good thing we didn't have plans after dinner. 

We went with the four course meal for two for $40 which includes soup or salad, one appetizer, two dinners, and one dessert. You also get complimentary pita bread and a thyme and olive oil dip. The food was not something I would come back for. I didn't like their lentil soup. I only enjoyed the baba ghanoush. Their signature dish, Farooj (baked chicken) was cooked well with the garlic, citrus juices but it just didn't do anything for me. It wasn't terrible and it wasn't out of this world. My husband liked their baklava. 

The server was visibly overwhelmed by all the tables and people kept trickling in. The hostess or busser wasn't much help. She would just tell the server someone needed her instead of asking us what we wanted. 

The whole thing was a trainwreck to witness. The two employees arguing with each other and the expected mishaps that can occur when you're understaffed. I'm not sure if I'll be back. Most likely not."}
{"text":"Eating here took me back in time, to when I spent 2yrs in the Middle East! 

The Good: Menu choices! Right down to Beverages, especially non-alcoholic Bev's. I'm talking about Mint Lemonade and a variety of hot teas plus Turkish Coffee! We got a Mint Lemonade and I was instantly transferred back to Kuwait. They brought out some puffy bread with some Olive Oil and Cracked Peppers- delicious!! The quality of the food was great!! The Khourys Salad, was just as tangy from Lemon juice, as I hoped!! My husband got the Fattouch salad with Gyro Meat- he LOVED IT! I ordered the Combo Kabob plate. This was evening, **which matters because portion & price change for Lunch and dinner**

The Negative: Why am I deducting a star? For one, the menu stated that the lunch serving size for kabobs were 2, dinner was 3 with the choice of Salad or Soup. I was looking forward to getting Tabouleh salad. But it was about $2 extra to switch the salad option. I thought I had a choice, but apparently you only get a choice for lunch. The Combo Kabob plate gives you 3 skewers of your choice of meat ($21.95 for Dinner), yet when I asked for 1 skewer to be the Lamb, it was a $2 upgrade. When I finally got my dish, the rice was cold. But that didn't bother me so much because I wasn't going to completely eat all the rice. What DID bother me, was that for $23 I got 3 skewers (Chicken, Beef, Lamb) with only 3 small to medium chunks of meat, with grilled veggies in between. Only 3 pieces of meat per skewer! I have been to many Mediterranean restaurants and all their skewers were filled with meat and the grilled veggies (onion, tomatoes, peppers) were on the side WITH HUMMUS. This dish did not come with Hummus, they did add a small amount of Cucumber Yogurt dip (which was tasty). Honestly, for a $23 diah, there should be leftovers of meat. There wasn't. They trick your eyes by putting veggies in between. The food itself was delicious. We also ordered fries on the side- because learning this was a Lebanese restaurant, we have had the BEST french fries in Lebanon! But these were disappointing. They were limp, no crispiness whatsoever. Their Garlic Sauce was on point though! As far as Ambiance goes, i felt it was too bright in there and also that they seat you very close to other people. They probably want to deal with one area, but I could literally hear the conversation at the table next to us while the rest of the place was empty (cuz this was around 10pm). 

But I would definitely be back and would take advantage of their happy hour or lunch menu. But I would not order the Kebab Combo plate for dinner again, Because the portion size does not justify the cost.  Service was good. Loved the music."}
{"text":"After the awkward experience on 04-22-2013, I gave this restaurant one more chance. Some times shit happens but that should not stop you from tasting good food. So no hard feelings there.

I went to this restaurant on 04-30-2013 at 11:45 AM PST.
Got seated immanently. 
Thoroughly enjoyed Middle Eastern Music.
Clean Restaurant.
Ordered Chichen and Lamb Combo Kabob.
Hummus came as a side Item.
They Server Complimentary Bread with home made sauce to dip in.

Food is Awesome. Let me start with the Bread. Never Had such a fresh bread in Vegas. I will go there again for the bread alone. The bread dipping sauce is awesome too.

Kabobs are tasty but i can not rate them as the best i ever had.
Rice tastes great.
This time I am very happy with the service. I will go there again for the Bread :)"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for first time. New location with great decor and wood burning oven.
Having lived in Beirut I found the food to be excellent and very authentic Lebanese. Ordered the small meza( assorted plates) which was plenty for two and very good.
Service was very slow even after packed house emptied out. Will def come back Monday thru Thursday next time."}
{"text":"I found Khoury's on my nifty BB yelp App this weekend during my annual Vegas trip. We were sick of QUICK food between our pool parties and clubs, so we decided we wanted something healthy, wholesome and delicious. We love Mediterranean food and the ratings looked promising so we decided to try Khoury's. Could it have been written in the stars that Khourys was only .5 miles away from the Vegas house?! Perhaps! 

A dimly lit restaurant where you can see the wood fire oven as soon as you walk in and feel the warmth emanating from it upon entering the establishment. The music was middle eastern sounding, and the familiar aromas of Lebanese cuisine pranced around my senses. We sat and looked at the menu that was rather full of variety. 

The salads were enticing, but when I saw the pizza choices I became curious as the descriptions were beginning to win me over. The BF wanted a Gyro, and suggested we share two meals. It was a great idea and I decide to order the veggie pizza, which came with feta and kalamata olives and TONS of veggies. We ordered the hummus to start. They brought us seasoned olive oil, FRESH pita bread that was DIVINE and some INCREDIBLE hummus. It was RICH and creamy, you could taste the tanginess of the lemon, the olive oil and the parsley. I LOVE the pickled beets they use to adorn the hummus. Absolutely fantastic. The pita was grainy, soft and fresh. It tasted amazing in BOTH of the hummus and oil. I couldn't decide which I liked better so I kept switching. 

Our food came out and the pizza smelled even better than it sounded on the menu. The vegetables were cooked to perfection. Not to crunchy or firm and not soggy and overcooked. It was bell peppers, squash, mushrooms, tomatoes, feta, kalamata olives and tomato sauce. The crust was awesome. Thin and soft. I was VERY impressed. I loved the feta cheese and kalamata olives on the pizza. It was different and the bold flavors always strike my palate. 

The gyro was awesome. It was sort of \"pressed\" instead of in a soft pita, so the outside was crispier. Definitely a texture we appreciated. The gyro meat was flavorful and complimented the flavors of the cucumber on the tzatziki. The fries were softer, they tasted EXACTLY like potatoes. Weren't over seasoned and appeared to be BAKED instead of fried. 

Overall this place was lovely. The ambiance, the staff (who I didn't elaborate on but they were VERY polite and didn't miss a beat with our service.) The food was excellent. Mediterranean food is definitely one of my favorite types of cuisine, and this one is a place I will SURELY revisit."}
{"text":"Since our former neighbors worked there, my partner suggested that we give them a shot the first time, while they were in the old location. When we did, the food was outstanding, very reminiscent of a small chain of places we used to frequent back in Arlington, Virginia, called Lebanese Taverna.

Alas, although the food was more than up to snuff, the service left a lot to be desired.

Not so for our 'return' to the new location, I am happy to report. And the food hasn't taken even the slightest dip in quality. It's always a thrill to be able to sit sipping wine or some other drinks, and watch while the out-of-this-world fresh pita bread is made, rolled out and baked in their wood-fired stone oven, and then served hot with oil and spices. Surpassed only when you dip it into the tasty hummus, baba ganoush and cucumber-and-yogurt mix that we could just have as a meal unto itself. But then there would be no room for the spinach Ftayir or the Samboosak, both highly recommended apps.

Our last trip for the main course, Bear had the Meat Combo, while I opted for the Lebanese Sandwich (aka \"Lahm Bi Ajeen\"), which was a pleasant surprise. It certainly changed my expectations of what a sandwich can be, or what as an American, I am used to seeing - heavy with meat and some veggies and lots of condiments. This was airy, light and plenty flavorful with ground lamb, spices and the fresh tomatoes and chopped onions. I would have it again in a heartbeat.

As a matter of fact, I have even suggested that we could now make it a habit of coming back to Khoury's at least twice a month on a regular basis. The food, though healthy as all get-out for you, doesn't taste like 'diet' food, and it's satisfying, but doesn't leave you feeling bloated. I wasn't surprised to see the number of people coming in just for take-out orders. If they were closer to us (we're in Summerlin), I have no doubt we'd do a lot more business with them, than just ordering burgers or pizza.

Whenever you're in the Village Square vicinity, I would enthusiastically recommend checking them out! Two thumbs WAY UP from this guy!"}
{"text":"Khoury's is really good! Great Lebanese place, though I wish they did a koukou (egg/frittata type dish) like the Lebanese place in University City (St. Louis) years ago. I love the fresh pita and olive oil with herbs for dipping. Their rice is tasty, so is the moussaka, but I think my favorite is the tabbouleh. Yum! Big portions, friendly people, ok prices if you go for lunch."}
{"text":"i love this place!!! they have fresh pita bread fresh out the oven and the food is always great!!! this place is veggie friendly too... whenever i go i order the house mezza plate... its enough food for 3-4 people! its a whole bunch of small veggie appetizer plates... THE BEST! they also make THE BEST GARLIC SAUCE!!!"}
{"text":"First time there, wasn't approached in a professional manner and our waitress wasn't very friendly. Food was decent!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Mediterranean food last night, now this is such a vast area and is influenced by many countries. I have eaten many dishes good and bad from this area, not saying I'm an expert nor claiming to be. But good food is simply good food. This place was not the best and for the prices not worth coming back to. 

The beef and rice soup was salty, the chicken and garlic soup bland, beef kebobs can use more seasoning, the house specialty chicken farooj was just lemon and garlicy and their mini house mezza was not worth 18.95. The pita bread was falling apart and crumbly, very strange. 

The service was like the food not the best, they were chatting away by the register and then once in a while checking up to see if your ok."}
{"text":"Fresh and authentic, delicious to the last bite! The best local French fries I have had! The ambience for lunch was great. I had the lamb shawarma wrap and it was amazing. The Mediterranean spiced pickles were the finishing touch. I highly recommend this for any locals or visitors looking to get away from the fast food and restaurant chain."}
{"text":"This may be the best Mediterranean (Lebanese) food in town. Sometimes the simple things make the difference between good food and great food. Khoury's hits all the marks for great food.

Fresh, top-notch ingredients stand out in every dish. Tabbouleh is made as it should be made, with abundant parsley, mint and lemon with just enough bulgur to soak up the tangy, refreshing  dressing. The tabbouleh & hummus are worth the trip alone, as are the fresh from the oven pillows of pita served with olive oil & za'atar  for dipping. 

You won't go wrong with any of the beef or lamb dishes, but vegetarians won't feel like second class citizens here. The extensive menu has everything one expects to find in a Mediterranean restaurant plus a few wonderful surprises.  Everything is profoundly fresh, tasty and nicely presented.

Service might be an issue during prime time dining hours, but on a recent late Friday afternoon, our server, Irvin was right on point. But when food is as outstanding as it is here, don't worry about it.  The food is THAT good."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  I haven't been in the restaurant to eat, however.  I have only picked up my order and eaten at home, so I can't comment on the service of the staff while eating at their location.

The hummus is pretty good.  Lots of flavor and a good sized portion.  The chicken shawarma is to DIE for.  Falafel is pretty good too.

Reasonably priced and pick-up orders don't take long to process and have ready."}
{"text":"Great fresh food.   Good service   The pita and hummus was so Fresh and delicious.   Perfect amount of spice."}
{"text":"The service is grate the food is awesome !! this place is one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas this is a must try ."}
{"text":"Absolutely appalling service. I come here regularly with my family and friends and have always had disappointing service, but the food always makes up for it. But today, I got seated outdoors and was left outside for 25 minutes. Not a single person came out to give us water or take our orders, they completely forgot about us despite several of them making eye contact with us through the window. Needless to say that we left because it was very agitating and rude. 

Sadly today however, I wasn't able to enjoy the food. However, the fresh pita bread is absolutely delicious especially with the jalapeño hummus or the olive oil and seasoning they give you. I recommend the kafta or the chicken kabob plates. Those are my go to meals when I come here usually."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  I've been in Vegas for 10 years and just recently heard about Khoury's from a coworker....AMAZING FOOD!!! I'm mad I didn't hear about this place sooner!  First off fresh homemade pita bread. We ordered the hummus , falafel, and lamb schwarma fries!  All awesome, plus everything except the lamb was vegetarian if that's something you're interested in.  Also a great happy hour food/beer selection and all the sauces are scratch made.  Great family owned and operated place with smiles and great food!  I'll be back soon. P.S. Try the baclava P.S.S. Ask for Kamiah, she's an awesome server!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The best pita bread around. All of the dishes have fresh ingredients and taste great.  For me and my family this is the best Mediterranean place in town.  Great food and service."}
{"text":"Tasty and filling. The shawarma plate is my favorite. Fast and friendly service. Helpful staff quick with answers . And did I mention that the food was fantastic?!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. I love the rice that come with the kabobs. The staff are very friendly also"}
{"text":"Not only was the food delicious, but the service was exceptional! Very clean restaurant, friendly service, and great atmosphere! 
True Mediterranean food!! Will go back"}
{"text":"Wonderful service tonight with Lana! Yummy food and a fun time was had! I loved the rice OMG!!! Recipe please!!! came late and had the whole place to ourselves! Dessert is an absolute must!!!"}
{"text":"Khourys, without a doubt in my mind, is the BEST middle eastern food in Las Vegas. As a Vegas native, I say this with assurance.  What I love about Khourys is their homemade bread. Very rarely do middle eastern restaurants continue this tradition. Also, the kabobs have the most wonderful flavors that make Khourys unique. My go to is the chicken kabob with a side of baba ghanouj. I love their baba especially because it includes picked vegetables. 
Lastly, the baklava is delicious. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. Give it a try and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Must try spot!  Love the jalapeño humus!  Food is great!  Great service and prices are decent. The lunch menu is also awesome!"}
{"text":"We work down the street and the entire staff LOVES this place. It is very hard to please everyone. When reps from various companies ask what to bring for a lunch in service, we always say Khourys!

I can even use it as bribe food lol Everyone looking forward to and excited about a Khourys day...gets lots more work out of them. Yes, it's about the simple things to us!

The bread is delicious and soft. It is the best rice, chicken, hummus and salad I've ever had and 15 staff all agree. Not many places do it all so we'll...they do! 

Baklava was a hit too! Brought a platter to my family's for 4th of July BBQ and everyone loved it. I didn't think the kids would like its complex taste in the midst of Oreos and chips ahoy, but I was wrong! They devoured the whole thing. These poor kids are deprived of delicious Mediterranean food, never having hummus before! That's a definite must-bring next get together. Especially hummus that's so hit or miss....Khourys is always consistently delicious.

Love their food!! Everyone does!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean restaurant in Las Vegas! Hummus is the best in town and always fresh pita bread! Food is delicious and good portions! Simi was our waitress and she was excellent and friendly . We will ask for her again when we return!!"}
{"text":"I personally love eating at authentic foreign restaurants. Mediterranean food has become my new favorite. Last month I was on a Japanese cake eating Ramen noodles anywhere I can find. This month I am all over Mediterranean food. This is my second time visiting this restaurant and both times I've been highly impressed by the quality of the food and the amazing flavors.  Not to forget the staff, who are friendly, attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"Delicious! Every time my husband and I dine here we order something different and have not had one dish we dislike.
We've ordered:
-The complimentary warm pita and dipping sauce melts in your mouth 
-Jalapeño hummus, good 
-The Greek salad which is a nice portion for just being a side salad. 
-Fried goat cheese app was yummy.
-Meat combo plate: hubby's favorite.
-Sujuk with rice is in imbedded in the best lemon sauce, excellent! 
-Kafta, yum!
-Meat Grape leaves, mouth watering and very filling. I ordered a side of Tsaziki sauce and it added a nice touch.
-Coffee, we're coffee snobs and it passed the test ;)
-Rice pudding, refreshing, I wish it had cinnamon on it, just a personal preference, I'll ask if they could add it next time.
-$2 margarita July can't go wrong. Surprisingly large glass too.
-SERVICE ALWAYS GREAT! Fanny was our waitress tonight and she's a sweetheart. She was so patient and informative with our 20 questions lol"}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE! Don't get me started on the food. It tasted as if my mother made it. It is so authentic and clean! I speak from experience and trust me when I say...if I could give this place a 7star review I would! Freshly made, well decorated, the owner is extremely personable, the waiters are beyond helpful and friendly! If you visit Vegas, then a visit to Khoury's Mediterranean Restaurant place is a must! Every bit of the ingredients is homemade and made right here in their kitchen. I am picky about Mediterranean food, and this place won my heart and stomach. Every time I visit Vegas, I will for SURE visit this place. Visit this place! You will be so happy you did!  #amazingfood"}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma sandwich and a hummus appetizer. The chicken was great, the hummus was good (I prefer hummus a little thinner and more creamy, this one is thicker and not as puréed, but great flavor), but the fries were gross. I don't know who likes fries that are soft/soggy and brown, with the potato skins on. They need to work on the fries and then I will go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! From the falafel to the lentil soup.. Five stars all the way. Plus the fresh pita and hummus starters are amazing!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch due to the great reviews on here and I am glad I did. The food was incredible. I had kafta, hummus and salad. The kafta was cooked perfectly and wasn't dry at all. Very juicy. I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"SEND THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT OUT.  FOOD SERVED WITH HAIR IN IT & THEN REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR UNSANITARY PRACTICES & EXPECTED YOU TO PAY FOR IT. 
Serves was very, very poor. Management was very, very rude & offensive. 1st, Server claimed the soup & salad order jammed in the printer, so we were not served timely. Then she served the food with hair in it. Another employee pulled the hair out of the food & then returned the plate to the kitchen. Next the \"owner\"  basically said we placed the hair in the food & had to pay for 1/2 the meal when we had not eaten ANY of the food & why would we put hair in food we wanted to eat?  The four spears of lamb shish kabobs, along with the rice & onions were left at the table. 
We paid for what we ate soup & salad, NO TIP for server & no compensation offered by the business for their poor services."}
{"text":"I love Khourys. Unfortunately (or fortunately) we don't live very close or I'd be there often. I do get the same thing every time because I crave it. The chicken souvlaki sandwich is amazing. There's something about the combination of the tahini and pickles. The fresh, stone oven baked pita with oil and herb dip is so good. The hummus is good as well and the babaganoush (sp?) is one of my favorites in town. The fries are fine, not a seasoned fry with feta or anything. We've only ever been for lunch and while they have an ok lunch crowd, we've never had trouble getting a table."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food but i won't be running back here.   The lamb was just okay,  and their chicken garlic soup was very tasty,  but you will be burping for the rest of the day.   So so ambiance,  nothing fancy."}
{"text":"We went on a sunday, a day that most people eat in a restaurant, they were out of labne and out of halloumi cheese!!!!! Eventhough it wasn't packed, the service was slow, only 1 waitress for all tables. I ordered a combo kabob plate. The kabob was good however the rice was either left on the stove for too long or it was from the day before, the rice was cracking. It's not a cheap restaurant so you'd expect more. The Hummus and bread were great. We were a party of 4 adults a teenager and 2 kids. We ordered sojok, falafel, kebbe nayye and many other things which were good."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in town. Definitely 5 stars deserved. Ervin was our waiter, very nice customer service"}
{"text":"OMG!!! Amazing! There's  no Mediterranean  or  Greek  that's even close to this Lebanese greatness  everything  made from  scratch, service  was fantastic  after todays  visit  they are  now the goto place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in here to try something new and we got a different surprise. I was happy to try Lebanese food. When the table bread came out. It was a deliciously baked puff with olive oil and fresh herbs. They make it in house so it's nice and fresh. I got the feta fries and a Lebanese street food option with lamb. The meat was earthy and full of good flavor. Similar to a moussaka taste. My BF got the gyro and said it was alright. When the feta fries came out they were entirely soaked with the sauce and almost to the point of inedible (my tip is to not order them or order the sauce on the side). Our waitress was kind enough to offer regular fries and took them off our bill since I didn't like them. For Mediterranean food, trying something different was good. But probably should explore other things on the menu."}
{"text":"We recently moved to pecole ranch area and decided to explore options. Boy are we glad we did! Khoury's offers excellent Gluten-free options as well as vegetarian options. The prices are reasonable and the service was very good!
They even have a 4 course meal for 2 special for under $45!
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delivered on time. The office that I bought it for seemed to like it. I had to do delivery on line, they couldn't do it over the phone which was bizarre."}
{"text":"Rolled grape leaves with meat inside was very good but not the best I have ever had. I got two of the hors d'oeuvre orders to make my basic meal. Other items on the menu were not prepared the way that I am used to so basically just got some pita bread and hummus with it. I wish that their raw meat dish was meat instead of lamb. Casual dining with a good atmosphere and friendly people. It is great to see a specialty dining establishment like this thriving on this side of town."}
{"text":"Good quality of food, great service, and chill atmosphere.  

The bread is fantastic, quality olive oil, and the appetizers were all good.  We ordered the sambousek, fried cheese, and labni with mint and garlic along with the kafta plate with some cardamom tea.  I was expecting the fried cheese to not be deep fried, I prefer pan fried, but it was all still delicious.  The quality and taste overall were on point. 

This place is going to be another frequent stop for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Food was great service was super friendly! I will be back for sure!  The restaurant was very nice clean welcoming!"}
{"text":"Sangria is amazing!!!!! And the food is crazy good for some stuff being so simple. Definitely surprises you. :)

Fanie the waitress is amazing! and hella funny, love her. Great place"}
{"text":"Love the jalapeño hummus, a great spot for after work, wine and appetizers were delicious. True Lebanese flavor and a great staff makes this a nice place to visit. Falafel and feta fries were so flavorful and a must try."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the BEST hummus I have ever had!
And that was just the start!!

I love this new location, and not because it is with in walking distance to my home, but because it is open, airy and has an awesome outdoor area in the front that I can't wait to sit and watch the world go by while snacking on delicious food.

Once we were seated the owner, Fanny, came right over to say hi, and to check in. Quickly and cheerfully letting us know the restaurants history (they were 10 years in another location), a few menu highlights, and to take drink orders.

I took Fanny's recommendation and had the homemade beer sausage in a bright lemon sauce. The yummy dish has a citrus pop for sure, but I totally loved the contrast of the earthy sausage and the lemon sauce! It was really different and yummy! 

Next time I think I am going to try a table full of apps, they looked amazing too!
It was hard to decide, with so many great choices!

Can't wait to walk on over again soon!"}
{"text":"messed up on my delivery order through grub hub. ordered 4 gyro sandwiches and 1 order of hummus. pretty basic right? get a call saying they sent the driver off with only two gyros. ok. i get that situated with grub hub. after getting off the phone with grub hub, i check delivery #1. i see two pita breads with no hummus. i call immediately to make sure my hummus is included in delivery #2. luckily i called while my driver was there because they JUST added it to the bag (because i called to remind them). i asked if they can include extra tahini sauce. and look at that.. the driver just so happened to leave. never coming back. horrible experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service! We ordered the stuffed cabbage and the kafta. Everything was so delicious! The flavors are just perfect!"}
{"text":"Awesome salads and hummus! Always very fresh tasting and great portion size. Nice variety of meat and veggies on the menu."}
{"text":"A good Tabbouleh salad tells the heart and soul of whose in the kitchen.  Today it was not the owner(s), and if it was gees too bad.  The salad was presented on a bed of romaine leaves, which is okay and acts as a filler from plate up.  The salad was by no means how they pictured it on the Mezza pictures.  
     There was hardly a breath of crack wheat used, a fine grind can make it hard to find in a salad, and tomatoes were finely chopped but covered by what looked liked grass clippings(parsley). The dressing had just a hint of lemon.  They serve sliced lemon with the plate to kick up the lemon flavoring if you like.  The bread served, was not fresh and already began drying out. 
     I took the olive oil and zartar spice for dipping the bread and poured it over the tabbouleh which helped with some well needed table salt made it far more enjoyable. (Hedary's down the street does a way better tabbouleh that comes out ready flavored and does have cracked wheat that can be seen.  I think they use a medium grind.).  
   Khoury's  recipe is certainly unique in that I found no mint nor cucumber nor green onion. The cost for this bowl, was $9.95 a little pricey for what's not in it.  I have made Tabbouleh a zillion times and can state for $9.95 you can make a HUGE bowl to feed a lot of people.  Today I just did not want to make a Huge bowl and left the work to some where else and can say it was a disappointing adventure.  
    There is a lot of staff working there and I think probably a big overhead shifted to the food costs is why something so inexpensive to make is pricey...I overheard a waiter tell some guests that a shot of Vodka for their drink was $8.00 and I'm thinking well vodka for $8.00 a bit much???...Oh well...The life of Lebanese food in this town will one day fall into the right hands and we will have a champion that will offer value,flavor and hope in this desert town!  I will go back one day, but not in the near future."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin, SO many GOOD things to say in a quick yelp review!! One of my top go-to restaurants in Las Vegas for years to come. I could never get sick of this place. The food is fresh and delicious, and the customer service is ALWAYS on point. The jalapeno hummus is always a must to order, with the Khoury's salad. The pita bread is warm, fresh, and HIGHLY addicting. I go through periods where I take a break from eating meat so this is a great place for vegan and vegetarian dishes like the falafel, manakeesh, or veggie pizza (no cheese). But for times when I am craving meat, the filet mignon beef kabobs I nearly dream about. They also have bomb feta fries as well as regular fries. 

Side note: I've only been once, but they have a fantastic happy hour mon-fri from 3-6pm $5 wine/sangria (best sangria ive had, strong in a good way) and $2 beers and $3-$6 bites"}
{"text":"Delicious. Absolutely outstanding experience. Obsessed with their jalapeño hummus, Greek salad, chicken kabob, kafta, rice, pita, olive oil, homemade fries, and baklava. We dine here weekly."}
{"text":"This place is a bit off the beaten path but way worth the trip.  Very authentic and delicious.  Staff was also very friendly.  HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch today.  Ordered the chicken Kabob with rice and Hummus. The food was amazing!  The only reason I gave them a 4 star was because the service was a little slow.  Other than that, it was clean and comfortable!"}
{"text":"We went here again this week for dinner. This time we opted to dine outside in the patio. We were the only ones out but our server was attentive and gave us excellent customer service as always! 

Tried different entrees this time and they were all good! I am totally in love with this place. We got a rewards card since I know we will surely be regulars here."}
{"text":"I was sad when the Ft Apache location closed, but here they are! They have dreamy, puffy, hot pitas to tease you, and an extensive gluten-free & vegetarian menu. Mom can't have gluten products and doesn't like \"weird\" food and she had a terrific dinner that made her happy. I loved my many vegetarian options, and the rest of my family enjoyed their meat options. Win-win-win!"}
{"text":"Came here as a large birthday group. Asked if they could split the check ahead of time. They said no. Getting our food was the most amazing mess ever. Bad. Bad. Bad. We were given the check but was taken away to be replaced with the actual check with added party gratuity. In the end one of servers admitted they should've split the check. No shit. Food was mediocre and water refills would've been nice."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food and good service. This restaurant was neither especially the latter. I've worked at a 5 star/5 diamond  restaurant but have my favorite hole in the wall no star joints with excellent service and quality food.  Will never step foot into this restaurant again. No customer service (no one greeted us as we waited at the podium for 10 minutes and servers kept passing by) and food is mediocre. Doesn't taste authentic and food is overpriced. Not recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Took a cab from the strip. Far away. 32$$ for the cab but worth the trip and cheaper than eating on the strip. Ordered lots of different things. Took people that never ate Lebanese and everyone enjoyed it!!!"}
{"text":"Service bad, food good!
Went to have a nice Valentine's Day lunch. We were seated and given menus. Our drink orders weren't taken for maybe 5 minutes. Which isn't too long, except for the fact that people who sat after us had their drinks. That left us plenty of time to peruse the menu. There was a Valentine's special. For a 4 course meal for 2 for $49.95. But looking through the regular menu we saw the same \"deal\" for $39.95. Hmmm, ok. Didn't like seeing that mark up at all.
We finally ordered and got our food in a decent amount of time. Redeeming quality of the restaurant is the food. Everything was really good!  Next time we come here it will ONLY be for take out."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  My family and I end up getting the large appetizer platter along with whatever entrees we each want.  Each dish has their own wonderful flavor, the restaurant is just lovely and everyone working there is so nice and charming. It is such a treat for us to have it so close to our home and they deliver too."}
{"text":"I have frequented this restaurant more than once and had good experiences. 
After a movie at Village Square I recommended Khoury's to friends...MY BAD. First of all, the server was overwhelmed and, of course, the service was very slow and inept.....not the server's fault. She was working very hard given her circumstances.
Despite the slow service, we had a great time(I'll get to the food later). We watched this scruffy middle aged man, in shorts and Tee shirt, smooch some famliar tables. We hilariously determined that he was the owner/manager....great entertainment!!!!
So...the food...
I would have not taken the time to write this review if I wasn't embarrassed by my recommendation and if our Lamb Shawarma tasted as I experienced on our previous visits.
My Lamb Shawarma could only be described as Lamb Jerky, Rice, and Tomatoes...
I really like Lebanese food and would hope this restaurant makes it; but get the old guy with the shorts into the kitchen!!!!"}
{"text":"Khoury's is sooo amazing. Love the food I always get the chicken kabobs, I love their rice. I am always craving their hummus and pita bread. Service has always been good when I have gone which is at least 25 times. I use my frequent card and have received nice discounts. LOVE LOVE LOVE Khourys!!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing this time around and the food is always great!! I ordered the salmon lunch and my husband ordered the stuffed kabbage. It was a great birthday lunch. I already was stuffed from the Appetizers alone but we have leftovers!!"}
{"text":"The hummus and pita bread were fantastic.  The shawarma plate was one of the best I have ever had.  Our waiter Dan was excellent.  I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best mediterranean/Lebanese place I've ever been too. This place is amazing I've gone here several times and every time I go I receive  excellent customer service and delicious food. the food is extremely fresh and tasty I recommend chicken shawarma and the Baba Ghannouj for sure"}
{"text":"Khoury's has amazing food. Whenever I'm craving hummus I know exactly where to go! The servers here though... I don't know what to make of them. The service and the food just don't match up. Sadly, it's not just one of the servers, but all that I've been in contact with except the woman with the accent. She is sweet but you can tell she just doesn't care. I came in one night to pick up a food order and stood at the host desk for no joke, 10minutes. I tried to get the attention of the two girls working and it seemed like they were ignoring me. So they are either that oblivious to what's in front of them or they are just not all the way there. However, the food is so good I always looked past the service until today. I called in a lunch order and I asked the woman on the phone if they had a hummus wrap with veggies and chicken. She said they did but it wasn't on the menu so I went ahead and ordered it. Well come to find out it was a piece of bread, hummus, and cilantro. It was literally an entire order of hummus thrown in a piece of bread. Not cool. I even told her what I wanted. I felt extremely ripped off and it made me not want to return. It makes me sad because I literally love the food, but the waitstaff really needs to be replaced with people who actually care and value customers like the owner does."}
{"text":"one of the best mediterranean food in town. Tons of flavors, very tasty dishes and friendly servers. I had Musaka and meat platter. It was very good. They have a lot of choices in their menu I'm sure they all good. Definitely come back and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about Khoury's? Food is amazing, restaurant is nice to look at, and they even have hookah out in the patio. Been here 4 times and haven't had a bad meal yet. The food is one of the closest to authentic ME cuisine I've found in Vegas. I go back and forth to Anaheim every other week so you can imagine how much ME food I'm exposed to!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat, fantastic service.... great food, awesome atmosphere. Great as left overs for the next day as well. Tasty, music is prime choice relaxed."}
{"text":"Woke up this morning still dreaming about the jalapeño hummus and soft, pillowy pita bread we had last night. The hummus had just the right amount of spiciness to it and we sopped up every last bit of it. We also tried  a pizza with the fajook sausage, which is homemade.  Very tasty as well.  I have a lot of respect for the fact that they bake the pitas right there in front of 
 Of your eyes.  Carb overload, yes but enjoyed every scrumptious bite. 

Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I had lunch takeout. Their pita bread is REALLY good. Right out the oven, fresh hot and delicious. Hummus has pickle and pickle juice in it. Thought that was a lil different. Taste not bad though. I got the beef kabobs. I really like the rice, but the kabobs were just ok. I didn't like the dessert Sabiet(?). Not good, not worth $6. This place has spacious setting, outdoor seating. It's a pretty relaxing place. I live so far from here, but I would drive here for their food. Thumbs up for this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. I had the gyros and they were the best I have had in Las Vegas. My partner had the lamb and chicken kabobs. He said they were very, very good.  The server was very friendly and since we were there later in the afternoon, it was not so busy.  She took the time to chat with us a bit. All in all, we enjoyed our visit and will be back again."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood authentic Mediterranean Khoury's is the place to go. The mini-mezza appetizer as well as the spicy sausage are a must try. The lentil soup is complex and delicious, definitely one of the best in town. The ambiance is somewhat lackluster but the food makes up for that ten fold. The servers are polite and attentive as well. Overall a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Love their tabouleh! Great restaurant. I never rush when I eat, so I don't mind spending time in a restaurant. Eating is always an experience and I savor it. Thats why my friends and I have this thing where we put our celphones in the middle of the table face down....pick it up and you pick up the tab. Hehehe Eating time = no celphones. 

And on the rare occasion I had to come in and out for lunch, I informed the waiter who made sure it came out in a few minutes, and I was on time for my meeting. 

Tips for eating out: Chill out. Enjoy the experience. Talk to your dinner date. Stay off your phone. Have fun. Don't rush! You wont believe how much you will enjoy your meal. Try it...you might just love it."}
{"text":"At work we've been trying to explore and get out there more, so we skipped our \"work lunch rotation\" list and headed for somewhere new.

I've gone to Khoury's once maybe two years ago and I barely remembered the place so we gave this place a try again.

Let me say that the food was very good.  Their fresh bread and hummus was an absolute pleasure to eat.  We all ordered a mixed plate of Beef Skewers and Kafta - which is like a seasoned ground beef in a shape of a sausage / hot dog.  For the food, I would give it a 7/10.

The service, however, left more to be desired.  This place seemed very busy from the lunch crowd but they all left by the time we got our food.  We came to this place around 1:10pm and were seated immediately.  5 minutes later we got our drink order taken.  5 minutes after that, we got our drinks and our order taken. 

Our food finally came at 1:45pm.  It took over 25 minutes for our food to show up.  We all ordered the same thing.  There were some notices under other menu items that it would take 20 minutes cooking time, but not under what we ordered.

Also, since we were starving and digesting our own backbones while waiting for the food.  We got bread and hummus which lasted about 2 minutes.  Another bread refill was needed and acknowledged by the waitress, however it took about 10 minutes before we received more bread.  Service is a  3/10.

I'm sad to say that the service killed my opinion of this place.  I'm giving it a 2 star review.  Maybe one day if we're looking to diversify our \"work lunch rotation\" list again we'll give this place a whirl again."}
{"text":"How they make their pita bread puff up like a butt cheek is beyond my baking intelligence. Tip: Eat it fast or it, will, get, crunchy!

Serving Lebanese food in the midst of every chain you can think of is a pretty good plus in my book. Why the 3 stars? Welp, the food basically satisfies your baba, kefta, falafel cravings. There really isn't any other shtick aside from the butt cheek bread that makes this place that unique. I think Paymon's is still way better!"}
{"text":"Nice little Mediterranean place out in the southwest. Only the chicken is halal. Had chicken skewers, the chicken was flavorful and well done. Also had shrimp skewers and they were even better! The rice is came with is just the perfect complement to either the chicken or the shrimp. I didn't care for the bread so much but it wasn't horrible. Definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try the food and service is great, we order from here at least once a week, food is always very fresh, and the staff is friendly and helpful. the inside is very clean, they have a nice outside patio."}
{"text":"Nice authentic greek place. The pita comes out fresh and inflated. The appetizer was great as well as the salmon on rice. Dairy free meal with focus on spices and seasoning for flavor instead of milk fat."}
{"text":"Very solid, authentic Lebanese food.  The restaurant itself has a casual feel yet the food is on point.  This is a nice local spot different than the typical Italian/pizza that one usually goes for on a date night or just to grab a drink and catch up.  The alcohol menu isn't huge but they have plenty of options.  They wee unfortunately out of the more rare beer I wanted (please restuaranters, learn to update your menu), but I found another beer to my liking easily.  The HH menu is actually remarkably good.  Usually HH only gives you basic appetizers like hummus and falafel, but this one included actual smaller offerings of real eats.  I had 2 kabobs, lamb and steak, both excellent and super filling.  HH prices are great and under $5 for meals and drinks, but looking at the actual menu cost seemed pretty typical of the area.  Portions are very good though and can easily feed you for lunch the next day.    With a nice outdoor area to dine when the weather is nice and a very large menu, I'll be back, especially if i can make HH once again."}
{"text":"I've always loved Mediteranian food.  This is definitely one of my favorite spots!  

I love the interior of the restaurant.  Its different, and you definitely get that authentic vibe.  My favorites here are the chicken kabob plate, hummus appetizer and their chicken and walnut salad!  Their kabobs are so juicy, and I always get it with a side of tzaziki sauce.  Their salad is so fresh, and their balsamic vinaigarette thats served on it is absolutely divine! Their bread that comes with their hummus is always straight out of the oven.... and their hummus always made so perfectly.

I will forever be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Since we didn't even get seated I can't comment on the food. Terrible service upon entering, no hostess and sign said \"please wait to be seated \". My husband and I were the only 2 waiting. No one ever acknowledged us, after 10 minutes of being ignored we left.  3 different employees walked past us and no acknowledgement, we must have been invisible."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant with amazing food .
They offer delivery with EAT24 and GrubHub ...
The food was delivered extremely fast all the way to HENDERSON ......25 miles from the Restaurant  !
Definitely will   Order again !!
Thanks Khoury's :-)"}
{"text":"Love both their shawarma and their gyros!  Fantastic desserts.  The Mint Lemonade was very good, but pricey."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite mediterranean places! We tried to go to the greek festival but they didn't have any vegan food so my GF and I ended up here instead! YUM. I love the falafel, hummus, lentil soup, the fresh pita is incredible!! We also got musoaka and it was delish."}
{"text":"This is a yummy Mediterranean spot next to a movie theater I go to a lot went for lunch before a movie The baba ghanoush was amazing the jalapeno hummus was yummy and the gyro sandwich had great flavor I'll definitely be going back to try more"}
{"text":"The best authentic Mediterranean food in Las Vegas! This new location has even better parking and ambience. Hummus, feta fries, bamieh (okra) are my staples for appetizers and the farooj is a must have for the entree. End it with shabiet and you have the most decadent and filling meal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"BEST RICE IN TOWN! I'm not as big on Lebanese food as I am on Persian food but their kafta is still real good.  Their rice is something from heaven, so good I usually order an extra side.  Also, their pita bread is made fresh right when you come in, soooooo nice!  Their service is great and friendly!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Khoury's since they were over on the southwest side and they have always been amazing! From the bread to the kafta the service and the ambiance, it's always a great time at Khoury's!"}
{"text":"Pretty gross and expensive for what we got...:   Lemonade at 3.50 with no refills.  They don't bring you water to table.  Ordered chicken kebab. It was so greasy there was a puddle of oil on plate.    My husband got lamb shwarma. He who eats everything found it chewy and left most of it over. The Diet Coke tastes funny. She said let me try running machine. No thanks why don't you fix your machine then serve me.  Never again."}
{"text":"It's ALWAYS GOOD!!!
APRIL takes great care of us, great service!
Thanks!"}
{"text":"They got a 2 instead of a 1 because our waitress was amazing. Although the service was spectacular, the food was medicore. It's not horrible and edible, but I wouldn't go back ever again. The flat bread (naan) was like a crispy cracker which is dissapointing when you are craving the delicious soft delicate goodness of naan. The hummus was ok....but nothing great. We ordered the Shrawrma Plate and Lamb over Hummus....IT WAS THE SAME EXACT PLATE! The meat was over salted and the strips weren't what Shwarma really is.  Definately dissapointing overall especially after spending $70 to get a non authentic menu. We LOVE this kind of food and have been experimenting other places so we know what's good and what to compare it to. Too bad, because this one is so close to our house. The place was kind of empty too,which usually we consider it's just not a popular choice of food for people but this time it was probably due to their lack of authenticity in food. It's a nice clean pretty restaurant, but all that doesn't matter when the food sucks and paid too much for it."}
{"text":"I love the chicken sandwich and the homemade pita bread  staff is supper friendly"}
{"text":"One of the best Lebanese food restaurants in Las Vegas! Happy to have it in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go with the kids. Very cozy, and clean environment. It feels like home. The food and portions are great! Hey bake the bread fresh as they serve the sandwiches. Hummus is yummy! The chicken shawarma sandwich is so delicious it's a must try. And the fries yummy!!! Just if you order take out make sure to tell them to put condiments. Last time I picked up we had so much fries not even 1 ketchup . And we weren't eating at home, so was a bummer. And there's another cool thing they have on the menu.  They have doh for the kids to make bread or pizza, or just play. It's just $1 extra but entertains the kids, and they even cook it for you to take home! So much fun!"}
{"text":"This was the first time my husband and I ate here and I have to say it is the best Mediterranean food that I have ever had! From the fresh pita bread, the chicken shawarma to desert, there is no other Mediterranean restaurant that I will go to! The service we received was top notch! We will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is good , portion size is small though , love that they have fresh pita bread coming out of the oven . Zaatar manoushi wasnt a fan of it but it was okay . Overall great service , good atmosphere and good food"}
{"text":"My second trip here. The food is incredible, service is A++. The lentil soup is amazing!! The jalapeño humus and okra amazing!! The service is A++. Lana and April both are amazing!!"}
{"text":"food decent, bit pricy for what you get we had chicken shish kabob, came with rice.  that' was it.  no pitas, no hummus, no salad  unless you paid extra. that was our only experience and we never went back"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very veg friendly but lots of meat options too. Homemade pita bread is awesome! They have a 2-person dinner special for $39.95 that is a LOT of food - easily enough for lunch the next day too. Lentil soup was terrific, very flavorful and not mushy. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's a bit pricey, but the food is definitely 5 star. Cheerful waitress, happy to offer suggestions. We will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious grilled vegetable kabobs were not only perfectly cooked, they are healthy. Served with rice and a side salad, this lunch was so good, I took a kabob home.Pita bread was puffed up and served with a delicate Olive oil dip.
Ambiance--decor and Greek music added to my senses, bringing back wonderful memories ."}
{"text":"I come here once in a while since it's a distance away. Last night was out of the ordinary. The food was fantastic as always (flavor is consistent, thank goodness it's so good!) but the service this time around was very attentive and friendly...and FAST! It was a busy Friday night and they were also setting up the back half of the dining room for a booked party.   They seemed prepared. I hope they keep it up!"}
{"text":"Wow. Great Expectations turned into Armageddon. The pita is cooked right there in an open oven. Best part of the meal. Unfortunately you can't make a meal of pita. The cucumber yogurt was delicious as was the tabouli salad. That was it. The combo kabobs were tasteless, overcooked, dried out, basically inedible. Lunch bag letdown.
Then today I noticed they received a B from the health department in April, then immediately cleaned up their act and a week later they rated an A with only 8 demerits. Wonder if they are slipping back into old habits.
Will not return."}
{"text":"this place is absolutely amazing!! you couldn't ask for anything better then authentic fresh mediterranean food and great service from their employees for a good price!!!! best chicken kabob amd hummus in town! highly recommended."}
{"text":"When it comes to Mediterranean food my expectations are high, so I was not expecting much from this restaurant. First off, I like that it's small yet not cramped, and the decor is nice and family style. Customer service was excellent, the waitress was prompt and I really didn't have to ask for much. I ordered a greek salad, pita bread, and chicken and filet mignon kabob. Everything was full of flavor, honestly the salad was one of the best I've had just enough feta cheese, olives, and dressing so you can't deny it was Greek. The kabobs were yummy, not over seasoned and meat wasn't dry, even the veggies tasted good. Obviously the pita bread is a staple here so I must say if you go you cannot skip it, it was perfect nice and fresh the texture was spot on. Definitely going back to try other menu items. I was pleased with the entire experience. I hope they keep it as is and they will gain a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Tons of gluten free options. The Greek salad is amazing and so is the falafel."}
{"text":"Great family owned restuarant. I used to come to it when it was located on S. Fort Apache near my office; mostly ordered take out due to my schedule. It just relocated to Village Square (great for date night movie and dinner:). I've loved all the items ordered (salads, Chicken Schawarma, etc) as they are very well flavored, meat is super tender. Staff have been friendly. Four stars for now, as I'll see how I like the new location and update later. 
Update to my review dining on site for date night with my hubbie: 5 stars! Great service at new location  (staff are friendly, professional, courteous, and prompt), food is still extremely flavorful and tasty, dining in allowed for the plate of fresh hot bread. Enough food that there are leftovers for later..yumm. Music lightly playing sets a welcoming atmosphere...just upbeat enough to bring a smile, but mellow enough to feel peaceful. Yaay!"}
{"text":"Beef shish kebob is the thing to get. If you get carry out be sure to check your order, they forgot small items numerous times (sauces, salads, etc). I still like the place though"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Their food is great, hummus is nice and creamy and the  baba ganoosh is fantastic!!! Staff is friendly and atmosphere is great! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Walked in as a new customer and placed a To-Go order. After 15 min., I was told they were out of 1/2 of what I had ordered. Took another 15 min. to refund my purchase, because apparently, only the owner (who they had to call on the phone) is able to process refunds. Do they have good food? Unfortunately, I'll never know - they really did nothing to make me want to find out."}
{"text":"We ordered take out today for lunch from Khoury's. Everything was delicious! We ordered hummus, stuffed grape leaves, lamb shawarma wrap, and a falafel wrap. The hummus was the best I've ever tasted. I loved the spice used in the grape leaves. The wraps were dressed beautifully. Great variety and texture with pickles and radish. The wraps came with either fries or you could have a salad for $2 extra. We opted for the salad and it too was full of pickle, olive and feta briney deliciousness. The dressing was light and lemony and brought everything together. Our order was ready in 20 minutes and the lovely woman who took our order was delightfully polite and organized. We will be back often. Thank you for a wonderful lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious, really good Mediterranean food! From the freshly baked pita bread they have to every single dip and appetizer and Turkish coffee everything is just full of flavor. They make the best babaganoush I've had and super tasty rice. Every time we go we try different dishes and everything has been really good. The shrimp kabob was a bit too lemony for my taste bust still good. 
If you are craving some great middle eastern food, visit Khoury's and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The best Yogurt Drink I have had to date, tasty Baklava sticks and excellent menu choices puts this at my top 3 Vegas stops. 

They are pretty close in proximity to another favorite making this place a solid competitor in quality tasty Mediterranean. The bread and dip that comes with the meal is delicious. The hummus is addictively good and pairs well with the hummus of course. 

I will come back just for the Yogurt Drink. It's that good."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, good service when not busy. The jalepano hummus is awesome! Fresh hot bread is addicting"}
{"text":"If you need a Lebanese food fix while in Vegas, this place is your best bet. Do yourself a favor and order something that comes with their piping hot, homemade pita bread. Give it a few minutes and let the loaves cool down; then dig in. You're welcome. Since every Lebanese person is an expert at critiquing Lebanese food (and basically everything else) you can trust me on this, you won't be disappointed. My wife gambled on the kafta and I placed my wager on the chicken shawerma sandwich. Both of them paid off big. Of COURSE I had some of her food, are you kidding me? Their rice is made just like mom makes it, and they're accurate with the amounts of spices, especially sumac. Did I mention the fresh, made to order pita bread? What're you waiting for?! We'll be back the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"So many great menu items! The fresh pita is the perfect start. The shwarmas are all great and the sauces are tasty. My favorite are the fries, so delicious!

The ambiance in the restaurant has a traditional Greek feel. I personally prefer to take out since I can eat in the privacy of my own home...and scarf down all the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Awful service. Seriously, this needs to be fixed. I literally crave this food but cringe at the thought of having to come in. It ruins it for me. I've seen quite a bit of bad reviews about service and still no change. Every one a while I give this place another shot. Still the same. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants in Las Vegas that I have been to so far. Lunch or Dinner are great. Unique Lebanese dishes that I haven't seen at other places,  but the same traditional stuff as well.

Get the Lentil Soup... its great
Moussaka (not sure if i spelled it correctly) is the best I've had.

Desert or no desert get the Arabic Coffee... they put a tad bit of sugar/cardamom in it so ask for it without if you don't want it. 

Service was good, but not great... slow-ish but not annoying."}
{"text":"I had seen this restaurant a few weeks ago on the local morning news. We went in for dinner Friday night for the first time. When you walk through the door, the first thing that happens is the wonderful smell. The lamb, the garlic. Amazing.

We had the Pomegranate Sangria, Jalapeno Hummus and the Feta Fries to start.

For dinner I had the Lahm Bi Ajeen and my guest had the Shawarma Sandwich. Both were very tasty and we split a Greek salad.

Close to the house so we will be returning often to try new dishes."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and the service was pretty good. If you're in the mood to try something different, check this place out. The hummus was especially good with the piping hot pita bread. Yum yum"}
{"text":"Great fresh and crispy salads. Awesome hummus. Amazing chicken.   Trifecta."}
{"text":"This is perfect for a wedding rehearsal dinner party.The food is amazing, and the clean up is easy. The caterer came and set up, she was very professional and On Time!! I will definitely have them cater another event."}
{"text":"Went into the restaurant with my wife to have dinner, found the place to be quarter full, the music was blasting Britany Spear songs also the restaurant was warm to hot.
Sat down and ordered our food, the Baba ghanouj was gelatinous and had to send back, sent back the Lentil soup too. The kibbi was round instead of oval, I had the kabob and was ok but the rice was cold and flavorless.
Overall, it was a lousy experience"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it's still delicious! They get busy for much so be prepared to wait a little for service and your food. I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Very good Mediterranean food with excellent customer service. My girlfriend had the Chicken Kabob and I had the falafel. Both items were good and the portions were rather large. Lots of food for the price. We especially like the hot pita and Baba Ganoush. We would definitely come back and recommend Khoury's if you are in the area. Keeping in mind that we only visited for lunch, I think I would prefer lunch (before 3:00) over dinner."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place after our getting rerouted by a flash flood in Red Rock Canyon, making the direct route home a long loop through Enterprise. Needed a little snack and a drink, and Khoury's seemed to fit the bill. The service was great the food was even better, and the wine selection was... present. Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Quality ingredients at a great price handmade bread is wonderful!!! Everything on the menu is great can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Very good kofta. They servred it with a side of a mayo type sauce which made it darn good. I love the bread here. I ordered the spicy beef sausage dish and didn't really care for that recipe at all. Lentil soup just ok. I wish I ordered the signature chicken dish!  After u check in you would receive 50% off the signature dish. . description sounds amazing. Next time for sure!  Tip for owner: yuban coffee is not ok! Get izzy or a decent coffee brand and an espresso machine."}
{"text":"We love to come here!!! The food is delicious and fresh! Pita bread is fresh hand made. Irvin is a new server here and he provided us with the best customer service. I'm leaving this review just because of his an amazing service!"}
{"text":"Khourys has awesome food and awesome service. Megan was very polite and informative about the food. I would highly recommend if your looking for authentic Lebanese food !"}
{"text":"The service has improved dramatically. The food is exceptional as always! Love Khourys. April is the BEST!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Lebanese food in Vegas, if not the best. Great place for people to check out if you're just getting into Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and the pita bread is my absolute favorite. Unfortunately, I've been back several times and the service is always unbearably slow. If you have to get back to the office during lunchtime, I'd go elsewhere. Otherwise, relax and enjoy the grub!! I highly recommend the lentil soup!"}
{"text":"Ordered online through their website. Chicken shawarma plate and jalapeño hummus. Everyone was very friendly and the food was incredibly delicious and ready on time. We'll be back."}
{"text":"A go to spot in the area. Ordered the Beef filet kabob dinner for 2 which was absolutely delicious. The pita bread was also good and just a great to go eating experience. I hear they have hookah and its a fun place to go dine in so I look forward to doing that very soon. Check it out!"}
{"text":"My favorite Lebanese , so delicious and home made  , this place will have you addicted."}
{"text":"It's ok. We were so excited to come because we like the original, but this one misses on the warmth of the location.  It's ok, nothing more. The food was also just ok, but heavy on the salt."}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews on this place & actually going in for lunch & seeing that it was busy it seemed legit. But, I have to say they are understaffed & the food took a while to get to us. The pita bread is good, I also had the sharwama which wasnt anything special, I feel that the food could use more flavor/seasoning, Ive had way better Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I had been craving a Gyro sandwich for so long and that is what I ordered here. They give you pita bread to start off with and some kind of olive oil mix which was so good. The serving size was HUGE and so inexpensive. Service was outstanding. There was quiet a big selection to choose from. I really enjoyed the jalapeño hummus. I will definitely be back to visit again so I can try some of the other dishes on the he menu."}
{"text":"Super good food. I tasted many different flavors and spices compared to other chain Mediterranean restaurants which is amazing! Super good platters that has great portions ? one of my favorites"}
{"text":"Loved everything I had to eat! The service was great for the amount of space the two servers had to cover. The warm pillow bread is what I liked the most."}
{"text":"Good local Mediterranean restaurant.  I have been here several times now and find it OK.  I have a hard time not comparing them to other mediterranean restaurants in several states.  

They offer several dishes without meat (vegetarian). Their meat grapes leaves have a great flavor but they are the size of my ring finger. I have never in any other mediterranean restaurant seen grape leaves the small. Their cabbage roles are the same.  Literally the size of your finger.

The moussaka is very different than any other I have EVER had.  It is basically (dinner portion) two slices of eggplant with meat on top and then a marinara. It is clearly not baked in a casserole and topped with a cream & cheese based (béchamel).  

This restaurant has been around for some time (even if this location is new). Many people in the area really like it but at the same time I don't think many people have had a lot of mediterranean options to know the difference. 

It is OK. Not a must try but it will do."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was delicious! The warm pita and dip is good, hummus was yummy and the tabouli salad with falafel was great. My husband had the kibbi and said it was great too, better than a couple other local places.  We will be going back"}
{"text":"Good food all the way but the baklava was super awesome!  A friend brought me here and now I know I will start bringing my friends over too!"}
{"text":"I looked up Khoury's on Sunday after I had a Kibbeh-craving, which can be hard to satisfy in Vegas! We almost didn't go because of so many poor one- and two-star yelp reviews, but I'm glad we did. It wasn't the best middle eastern food I've had, but certainly good enough, and everyone we spoke to/interacted with was really friendly.

We ordered takeout and tried:

Hummus: very decent, I really liked the lemony taste
Baba Ganoush: my favorite thing we ordered (easy since it's one of my favorite foods, but it was pretty good baba)
Grape Leaves: not the best, wouldn't order again
Lamb-over-hummus: I didn't love this because it was pretty oily, and we ended up with so much hummus, but this was my husband's favorite thing
Kibbeh: Not quite as good as I was hoping for (they make it with beef instead of lamb), but still pretty good, and grilled instead of fried which makes it a little healthier!

They had a little patio for hookah as well, so next time we might try dining in and sample their hookah. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"When we walked into the restaurant last night, it was busy but had a few open tables. It took a few minutes for the hostess to come over to us. She asked us if we had a reservation, which we didn't, and seated us. It then took ten minutes (at least) for someone to come over to us and ask us for our drink order. We actually had to flag someone down. When the waitress came over, she apologized for the wait and was very friendly. Another waitress came over and told us that she completely forgot about us and also apologized. They were very sweet. 

The food was excellent. Everything came out hot and you could tell the ingredients were fresh. We did the $40 dinner for two and ordered the Greek and Khoury salads, the meat pies, beef kabob, baked chicken and baklava. The homemade pita bread and dipping oil were also delish. We had no complaints on the food and would come back.

We will give this place another try and if the service is better, which I hope it is, I'll update my review to at least 4 stars."}
{"text":"Just had the best meal here. Service is amazing. Food is fresh. We are originally middle eastern so are knowledgeable in what good Arabic food is. Even my kids loved it. Will definitely be coming here again on our next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"I always like trying a new Mediterranean restaurant and this seems to be highly recommended here.  I ordered the starter mini Meze (\"Mini Mees\"?) selection, which included some of the best hummus, baba ghanoush, and loubieh I've tasted.  The Lentil soup was average--I added some tabbouleh to liven it up.  I had their Mint Lemonade--and that was exotic and delightfully refreshing.  The pre-main course fare had me hooked already.  

For the entrée, I got the Chicken Shwarma plate with rice, tahini, and a jalepeño mint sauce.  It was pretty mouth-watering and tasty.  There portion was generous, enough for two meals, so I took a doggy bag home for another meal.

I didn't have dessert, but next time I'll try the Shabiet: filo pastry stuffed with milk custard and topped with pistachios and honey. (I can't wait!)"}
{"text":"First time so far so good waiter/waitress very attentive food really great first timer love love love  Atmosphere is calm and fits the cuisine 5*"}
{"text":"By far the best Mediterranean food in Vegas, and their 4 course meal for 2 is a steal."}
{"text":"One of those little places we kept meaning to try....so glad we finally did. 

First, it's super cute inside! Nice tablecloths, pretty decor, lovely patio. 

Our server was a bit aloof but extremely efficient. 

The food was really good. The hummus was creamy and dreamy. The babbaganoush had a delicious smoky roasted flavor. Each were served with fresh puffed pita. 

I got the meat combination with kibbi and kafta. Both good. I had never tried kibbi before. It was a neat meatball covered with a wheat crust and baked. The rice was good and flavorful. Everything was seasoned nicely. Nothing needed salt.

We will definitely go back!  I noticed they offer a happy hour with discounted beer and sangria.  I can picture the joy of a warm afternoon with a cheap pitcher of sangria and some great greek nibbles!"}
{"text":"Visited here based on the good reviews,chose to sit in the patio seating since it was pleasant out. As mentioned the Pita bread came out hot and fresh and a order of free yelp hummus! The falafel sandwich and fries were very tasty and best of all my girlfriend really liked everything so that's always good!. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The only reason I would not give this place 5 stars is the service is not that great sometimes. I would suggest getting there early before it gets busy. Benefit to getting there early is they have good happy hour prices and the service is usualy better.  I've never had a bad meal here. Always start with stuffed grape leaves (excellent) and usually get a Gyro or Shawarma Sandwich. Fatoosh salad is very good too."}
{"text":"no way! the food was not good and attention: 
they gave us plastic silverware !?! 
explanation: \"we are very busy, sorry about that...\"
i'll never visit that place again!"}
{"text":"Great hummus and baba, kebab is overspiced/seasoned, but the rice takes me back!  Pita's not my style, I'm used to big, flat, flaky Lebanese style pita, but if you like fluffier, Greek style pita, theirs should suit- it's fluffy, warm, and has a pocket.  They had quite a few things that initially caught my attention.. First was Bamyeh!  Unfortunately, their bamyeh was meatless and had cilantro (yuck, and btw not common in arabic food).  Second was the foul, which was good, and fattoush, which was the best I've had in a while.

Other good eats:
warak enab (aka dolma/grape leaves) - I've only had the meat version
falafel
labne

I've never eaten in, but it looks cute for a resty in a strip mall (it's located in the same strip mall as DW bistro- GREAT restaurant)."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! They have good pita which is baked fresh and comes out toasty. The olive oil herb dipping sauce is a great complement. The mezze platter would also be a good with the pita.

Lentil soup tastes fresh and homemade; very hearty.

I really enjoyed the Khoury's Salad with either chicken or lamb shawrma. It's a really large portion. 

Service is friendly. They have a Yelp check-in offer for Free Hummus! I've gotten it twice!"}
{"text":"Wow. That's all I can say!!! Whoever has eaten here or is planning on eating here is a fool... Hands down it was the worst Mediterranean food in all of Las Vegas.  The only tasty food was the hummus..."}
{"text":"We love everything about this place..   Gyro n hummus rock...  Baklava is sooooo good.  Bresia is the nicest waitress."}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean restaurant I've ever been too. All the flavors were spot on and the service was friendly.  The garlic butter is a definite must for dipping fries or bread."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. Arrived for dinner during the week even though it's a bit of a drive from the strip. Parking was no issue since they are located in a large strip center. 

I'm not an regular diner of Lebanese food cuisine but the selection of choices was extensive and they bake their own pita bread in what looked similar to a wood burning pizza oven. The friendly waitress mentioned this is a new location and the interior is decorated tastefully and clean.

I ordered the grass fed lamb tenderloin kabob which included a house salad, pita and I added a cup of yummy lentil soup. The kabob contained bell peppers, tomato, mushrooms and was served over a bed of rice. I ended my meal with the suggested dessert of Shabiet  - which was delightful.

Overall, quality and value here was solid and I would definitely return here if in the area again."}
{"text":"Ever since my wife brought me home the Farooj on one of her girls nights, I am hooked. This has to be the best dish in town right? Plus they will deliver it to my"}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and what a treat it was!  The traditional hummus was on point and the lamb in the gyro was tender and delicious.  The service was wonderful and welcoming!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was not good for 33 dollars had chicken that was overcooked and got charge for a saladed upgrade that was a joke, much better places in Vegas. I did mention my concern and they did not care at all. STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"This is true Mediterranean Food and not greek.  The food was great, but is filled with a lemon taste compared to greek.  

Service was great, food was great, and the pita bread, hot out of the oven, was unbelievably good.

Had a great time here.....will be back."}
{"text":"Food amazing , it's kinda of far from me but worth driving there . Been there 3 times in 2 months"}
{"text":"I used to come to this place a lot, until one day....all the waitress inside restaurant changed(manager changed?), I ordered my usual for dinner portion, but it comes out like what used to be in lunch portion...there are only 3 piece of meat on one skewer? this is horrible...I can't believe they are skimping out on the meat and portion, GREAT SERVICE though, the waitress who served us was super sweet and food taste good, but 9 piece of meat on skewer shouldn't cost $17....so unfortunately I will not go back there."}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW. OH AND WOW ! I'm from Los Angeles so Im used to having this kind of middle eastern food in any city I visit. I was surprised to find this kind of food and ambience in Vegas. I think I'll be visiting vegas much more just to have this restaurant. We ordered mezza, kabobs, and chicken. It is a tad bit pricey because the portions are too small. However, you get value food. They start you off with delicious homemade pita bread and oil and zaatar dip. The service is wonderful too."}
{"text":"So I've been packing and moving into my new home all day and haven't gotten a bite... Got finished for the day around 10ish... Was driving around my new neighborhood w no clue of what I was craving for... As I passed a little plaza I see an OPEN sign still lit up saying Mediterranean Food... I'm like, Hmmmm... So I pull in, park then enter and I'm like oh, you're about to close? Waitress walks up w a HUGE smile  And was like \"we close at 11, would you like take out or dine in?\" I'm like \"Dine In Please !! Are you sure? You're about to close?\" She's like Please! Have a seat! So I tell her I just moved to the neighborhood and I've never eaten there before... So she politely goes over the menu w me... After I take a gander for a few minutes, she comes back and takes my order... I'm like \"How's the Chicken Schawarma?\" She's like \"Delicious!!\" Cool, I'm Game!! So I got a choice of 3 different soups or a house salad... And I went w the salad... And boy!! I tell ya!! It was Bomb  Romaine Lettuce, Cucumbers and Tomatoes w a Lemon, Olive Oil and Mint House dressing... On Point!! So Refreshing and Healthy... She then brings me fresh Pita Bread \"Hot\"  and Fresh off a Hot stone or oven w Olive oil and thyme for dipping... Then my main course come out... Dammmmmn!! HUGE Serving of Chicken Schawarma, Rice and seasoned onions w \"The BEST\" Tahini sauce I've ever had!!! And I've tried MANY!! As I tear my pita, stuff it w the salad, rice, onions and chicken... I then topped it off with the Tahini... And it was like \"Ecstasy\"  in my mouth  Soooooo BOMB!!! Anyways, it was pretty late, and the lovely waitress was SUPER SWEET and Definitely made my evening... She gave me a sample of the Baklava and it was Simply Amazing too!!! I'm pretty bummed that I stumbled upon this rare gem too late, but they're moving close to a friend of mines restaurant on Sahara and Ft.Apache... This will Definitely be worth the drive!! And if you haven't tried the restaurant, you definitely need to... Customer Service is Stupendous!!!"}
{"text":"For some reason I've been craving gyros like crazy. Luckily Khoury's is down the street and they have this awesome gyro sandwich. I always substitute the fries for rice and I love it. They give a huge and I mean a huge portion of rice with it so you are full of carbs anyways. There is sort of a rewards card so I think after you spend a certain amount you get a certain dollar amount for food. We've gone so much that we can get a free gyro our next trip! The consistency of what's inside the gyro kind of changes. One time there was no yogurt sauce etc. I've always ordered to go so I can't really say how the service is besides that getting to go is awesome. It's warm by the time I eat it at home because they wrap it up in foil and it's still delicious. Overall, I am interested in trying other entrees but I definitely need to go inside to try it."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Mediterranean places you will find in Las Vegas. The quality of food here is far better than Paymon's. 

I agree with my reviewers that it is slow service, but part of that is because everything is made fresh to order.

They start you out with a pita bread made fresh in the oven served with dips.

I almost always order the Lamb Swarma served with fries. Never been disappointed!

My guests have ordered Kabobs, Baba ganosh, and salads. Everyone seems satisfied. 

Lunch is very busy, so I suggest an early dinner. 

Nice people, even if they are slow, they aim to please."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic & delicious Lebanese food you can find in Vegas! My server, Brandon, was really knowledgeable & attentive, which was helpful because the menu is expansive & I had no idea where to even begin. He recommended the fresh squeezed mint lemonade & it paired perfectly with the pita, which is TO DIE FOR, and jalapeño hummus, very refreshing!!! The beef kabob was super flavorful and the rice is so good it cannot be replicated. Haven't sampled everything on the menu yet so I definitely will be back! I've tried many Mediterranean/Arabic restaurants in the area and Khourys is simply the best. Brandon was an AMAZING server and the place has such a genuine feel I would definitely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"didn't like it at all. overpriced and staff wasn't all that friendly. food was whatevers. I went here about 2 years ago and haven't been back. Nothing about this place lures me to come back. I wouldn't really recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Their lentil soup...delicious!! Their walnut salad...amazing!  I usually get these two things when I go. Generous portions in the salads with loads of whole walnuts. I've tried a few other dishes on the menu and they've been good, too. Oh yes, their fries are homemade and super tasty too!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the food here. I could eat mediterranean food every day without a problem. I have relatives who are from Lebanon so I grew up eating grape leaves and jocoque.

The food here is really good, I've tried probably everything on their menu. All of their appetizers are good, in particular th grape leave although they could be bigger! The lentil soup is also great.They have different types of kabobs, lamb, beef, chicken, fish... This is like the only kabob place that asks how you want your meat cooked, major plus. Lamb should be medium-rare in my opinion. Oh, and they also make their pitas on the spot with a wood-burning oven. Delish!

For me the food merits five stars, however the service is lacking. The first time I came here I made a reservation on Open Table. Once we arrived and I informed the waitress we had a reservation she was like, Wha's open table? Reservation, huh? They can be kind of brusque at times, but the food is so good that it rarely bothers me. They also offered a Groupon about a year ago which was a total steal. 

Best place in town for kabobs, hands down."}
{"text":"Jalapeno hummus is still as good as the first time I tried it. DAMN, HOW DO THEY DO IT FOR REAL?!?!?!?!? 
I also had the FETA FRIES. It was good. They do not mess around with the amount of feta that they'll throw on those babies. I'm not a huge MUSHY fries fan, so I didn't really enjoy it once the cheese started to make the fries soggy. For those who don't mind chill fries, this is probably some good stuff. 

They're having HH on drinks all day until end of July, 2015. I think the food HH is still going to stay at 3-6p.m."}
{"text":"The music was awesome. I wish I knew what the playlist was. I don't recall if the food was great, but we were out on a rare date, without the kids. All I remember was how awesome the music was and that it was pleasant re-connecting with my hubby."}
{"text":"We always have had great food and service! Can be a little pricey for a family of four, but it never keeps us from going back! My kids love the fresh bread and the chicken kabobs!"}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is horrendous! We waited for over thirty minutes to order our food. The restaurant wasn't busy either. We didn't get silverware until we asked for it ! We had to eat our appetizer with our hands due to this!  We had to ask for a sauce twice. We had the fries with the tzatzki  and lamb. They were okay.  We had to wait for the pita bread for over ten minutes For our main course we had the filet mignon shish kabob. The meat was dry. They charged us for the dinner portion when I questioned the server she said lunch was over! When I told her that had she come by earlier we would of gotten the lunch portion and pricing she didn't seem to care nor apologize for the wait! We will not be back to this restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Delicious! A bit on the pricey side for mediterranean food. But the food is amazing love the fact that they make there own pita bread fresh, they have a great patio makes a nice lunch. Great app is the jalapeño hummus made fresh to. Overall always a good experience."}
{"text":"When you first sit down, make sure you get the fresh-out-of-the-oven Pitas. It is amazing. freshly baked on the premises. This place was really busy. Service was prompt and efficient."}
{"text":"Best lebanese food in vegas. Great service and a very extensive menu. Its a little far from the strip but definitely worth the trip. Highly recommend the large mezza order, okra, and fried cheese."}
{"text":"First time eating here and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Casual atmosphere with nice friendly service. Food had great flavors and well prepared.  I would totally go back for more and recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"I'm not too big on Mediterranean food but this place is good. I have the filet mug on kabobs. They were soooooo delicious! Succulent meat at its best. The service there was great too. The waitress was very attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"This is the second time that i've been here.  My initial impression of great food and great service had been confirmed."}
{"text":"Nice family atmosphere, the staff is pleasant and attentive, although the service was not seamless (some delays here and there). Food was good, the meat combo platter was a great way to sample different kabobs. The beef kabob was tender, the Kofta aromatic, the Sujuk sausage little too spicy, and the Kebbeh bland. The lamb Shawarma was however so so, and the fries were saggy. One more downer, Coke was flat, so the waiter offered the smallest bottled Coke with no refill as an alternative (a couple bottles would have been a more gracious service recovery gesture). A three stars, with the potential of four if not for all the discrepancies."}
{"text":"This is our new Go-To for Mediterranean. Whether picking up dinner or stopping for a snack before a movie, the restaurant is family-owned. Their friendliness is apparent and consistent. 

If you haven't tried them, do so and Vote them Best In Vegas!"}
{"text":"I will give them 1 star because the lentil soup and fresh pita bread. The server was nice but I really wish she had offered something in return for the 1/4 of the meal that was actually eaten because the meat in both our entrees was bland and very dry. Smelled amazing when we walked in but disappointing taste. My friend sent his meal back after 4-5 small bites (he said he really tried to get it down but he loves his meat and this was dog food quality if that, I wouldn't feed my dogs this). The server asked what was wrong, we both explained. She asked if she could take his plate. She asked me if she could get me a Togo box. I said NO. I know I've been a server before so maybe I'm a bit critical but when one person sends back a meal that is missing 4 bites and the other hardly eats half of their meal, there is your sign! $16.50 for 5 small bites of a platter. I should've taken a picture of our plates before she rushed them off. I paid for his meal because I felt so bad and I'm not happy about paying my hard earned, heavily taxed money for a meal that was wasted. No good Khoury's, I should've trusted my fellow Yelpers even though my friend said his friends told him it was great."}
{"text":"Great place and great food. Only reason it is not a 5 star is due to the clueless and slow service. Food is well prepared and very tasty. I highly recommend the spicy sausage and the lamb kebob. Their home made lemonade is also very good."}
{"text":"Great food, my husband and I love Mediterranean food and We were very pleased that we found this place. We only can recommend it and we will be back for more."}
{"text":"Khourys is awesome. Freshest ingredients, courteous service.  Lana is always welcoming and takes care of us with a smile.  I can't get enough of this place"}
{"text":"I came here for a dinner recently and we started off with this numerous assortment of appetizers. It came with little dishes of pickles, hummus, okra, green beans, salsa type thing, and you eat it with puffy pita bread that comes right out of the oven. The pita bread is SO good, fresh and hot. I had the chicken salad with a lemon olive oil dressing. It was ok. One the ground sirloin to me was not that good and reminded me a bit of lamb, maybe it was the herbs but I didn't enjoy it. The rice is good and we had a pitcher of pomegranate sangria which was pretty delicious. If I get come back here, I'll be sure to try the Hookah here."}
{"text":"Been here several times and have always enjoyed the food and the service. And it's conveniently around the corner from our house."}
{"text":"As soon as we open the door we can smell the welcoming complimentary pita bread. We loved our server Lana. She guided us through the menu and made suggestions, best falafel I've had so far. 
We can't wait to return with our family and friends."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Khoury's; I decided to come here for my Birthday dinner with my family since the food is delicious. We were sat right away and I ordered appetizers. Took them over 30 minutes to bring waters to our table. Between appetizers and dinner, our plates were piling up on our table, water glasses empty, missing silverware; had to wait with our food in front of us with no silverware. Once the waitress found out that my husband was Lebanese, she was a little more attentive but still the plates were piling up. Waited over 45 minutes for our main course. 
I would say that the food was good until my brother found a very long hair in his tabbouleh."}
{"text":"This is our third visit to Khoury's and we love it! The outdoor patio is gorgeous and the food is authentic and delicious. Don't come here for a quick bite, everything is made in house so it can take a little time to get your meals. The service is great, totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Really good food, the pita bread was great! Freshly baked and hot. Everyone in my group enjoyed their food. Unlike many reviewers' experiences, we got very good service."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in the comment the OWNER had to this business.  I don't think you all can see my response so I'm posting it on here as a follow up to my review.  I'm sooooo upset!  How does the owner state she is just a manager when we asked for the owner or manager?  How does the owner prefer to let a customer go and \"investigate\" what happened?  I have NEVER heard of such a thing, especially as I have restauranteur friends and they would NEVER allow a customer to leave unhappy.  Why ask for a phone number when they will NEVER call you?  Why not resolve the matter before the customer leaves?  These are questions that run through my head as I am appalled by Mariz's ownership skills in the restaurant business.
Mariz,
Telling us you're the manager and not stating you are the owner is definitely concerning.  Especially when you allowed us to walk out the door very dissatisfied with the customer service your server provided.  When we refused the dessert because we wanted to get out of there you FAILED to make things right.
If you had pride in good customer service you wouldn't have taken my number as you yet have \"called me back\"  It doesn't take a week to figure out where your staff went wrong, especially when we indicated there was disrespect from your staff. 
 My review was placed because you allowed us to leave.  What business owner allows that?  I don't even think a trained restaurant manager would allow a customer to leave unsatisfied.  Understaffed is one thing, RUDE and ATTITUDE is another.  The fact that YOU, as the OWNER, did nothing speaks volumes.  VERY DISAPPOINTED and even if I thought of going back, now that you have done NOTHING in over a week demonstrates you would rather lose loyal customers than resolve TERRIBLE customer service."}
{"text":"Hey fellow Yelpers!  I thought I'd put another rating out for Khoury's.  They are a really great establishment and mean well.  I've visited them since my last yelp and again the shawarma(sp.) was simply amazing.  One day I would like to sit down in their restaurant and enjoy a meal, maybe try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars solely because the girl who took my order was extremely sweet and considerate. I would give her 5 stars if the food hadn't been so disgusting. 

DO NOT ORDER THE GRAPE LEAVES. THEYRE DISGUSTING (sorry they are. They were soggy and flavorless. And the portion was insanely small for $9)
I'm love grape leaves. I eat them at least once a week so I know (for the most part) what decent grape leaves should taste like. These were barely stuffed and they were soaking wet and soggy. Literally, I ate a piece of one, spit it out and called to let them know there was something wrong with them. Their response was \"it's becz they're homemade\" I'm not sure you want to take credit for these being \"homemade.\"

I got my order to go and everything was just soggy and undercooked. The fries were cold and the falafel sandwich had sooo much sauce dripping from it. Just not worth it at all. 

Although I said it before but I'll say it again the girl who took my order and then helped me with the whole disgusting grape leaves was super sweet and considerate. If only the food could half as good as her."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of AMAZING.  We first started going to them at their old location and now at the new location this place is just off the charts.  The new location is bigger, more open and has a better layout then the old location.

The one thing that has not changed is the quality of the food which is just amazing.  We have never had a bad dish here and the prices are not bad.  You get a good quantity of food to go along with the quality so if you leave hungry its your own fault.  

This place is amazing and we will come back several times and I highly recommend this place.  If you have never had Mediterranean food this is a place you must try.

The bread is made fresh, the food is made fresh and everything here is definitely worth eating."}
{"text":"Absolutely by far the best Greek food and best customer experience we've ever had at a Greek/Mediterranean restaurant. We absolutely love this place. The fresh pita bread that magically rises into fluffy soft pillows is beyond words. Sometimes servers don't come back to the table often enough to refill drinks, etc but overall the service is good. The lights could also be dimmed a bit during dinner service. It's super bright which doesn't make for ideal ambiance. But honestly those are small potatoes. This place is our \"go to\" when we're craving Greek food."}
{"text":"First time here. They have an excellent menu served in a most pleasant Mediterranean ambience."}
{"text":"Delicious I love the food here!! It's a little pricey but it's worth it. Good customer service too."}
{"text":"This is the best Lebanese cuisine I have had since I moved out here from Michigan. They actually have the proper garlic sauce here that is supposed to be served with the chicken shawarma.

The grape leaves and hummus were excellent. The fattoush could have had more pita in it, but it was good. The chicken shawarma was excellent. It was perfectly seasoned.

I definitely will be back. If you like Lebanese food then come try this place. I definitely recommend that you try the shawarma. Good eats!! They also make the pita bread fresh in an oven that you can view from the dining room. Hot and fresh.

I will try the raw kibbie on my next visit and update my review."}
{"text":"We decided on this restaurant for our Christmas dinner with the visiting family. Everything was super good. the happy hour is fantastic and dinners were great. Service was superb."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. If I could give 6 stars for the service alone, I totally would. I had a family reunion here with my loud relatives, and the servers went right along with it! Plus it's just a cool little place."}
{"text":"If you are tired of eating burgers or sandwiches and feel a bit more adventurous, you have to try this Mediterranean restaurant. They have an extended menu, so you will definitely find something you would like. I heard they are popular for their hummus so I had to try it ---not a disappointment at all -- Their lunch /dinner plates come with the choice of hummus, salad or soup, I really liked the fact that you have a pretty good selection of sides besides soup or salad. I ordered the combination kabob which included your choice of 2 meats (lamb, shrimp, chicken or beef) the best part was the freshly made pita bread (that was awesome )  oh and  did I mentioned that they also have hookah services..."}
{"text":"Food is spot-on! If you truly appreciate Lebanese cuisine, you will love this place. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"The staff is very very sweet here! The food tastes great and their outside seating is nice. The items are a little pricey, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent meal each time I've been to Khoury's. their hummus is great, the oil with spices they provide with bread is good, and the service is always kind.

My favorite is their house salad and chicken kabob."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fantastic. It is authentic Lebanese food that tastes just like my grandmother's. I am giving them 4 stars because the service was mediocre. When we called ahead of time to make a reservation, they told us that it rarely gets busy. When we got there, it was roaring with people and there weren't enough servers (I guess that means the food is good). I would recommend the food to anyone. They're still new to Summerlin so maybe they will get their rhythm down soon. I would recommend the feta fries, samboosuk, and falafel. They were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Khoury's is the most legit Middle Eastern food in Las Vegas. First of all - the fact that they have garlic sauce on the menu is INCREDIBLE - it's rarely found on restaurant menus so be sure and order extra. If you haven't had garlic sauce, do yourself a favor and get your booty over to Khoury's. It has the consistency of mayo, but there are no eggs in it. The only ingredients are garlic and olive oil, so if you're planning to make out with anyone, make sure they have some too. (Also, I have tried and failed to make this at home more times than I can count. Garlic sauce is a thing of beauty when it's done right.)

I've had many of the dishes here and they're all fab. 

There are only two things I don't love, so let's get to it, shall we?

1.) It's a little over-priced. I mean, look - it is the BEST middle eastern food in Vegas, I know...but like, also...Middle Eastern food is home cooking, not gourmet eating. Maybe I was spoiled growing up in Michigan where you couldn't swing a cat without hitting great hole-in-the-wall Arabic food, but the entree pricing seems about $4-6 too high.
2.) If you try and order on Postmates, there are only like 5 or 6 things available in the app. I don't know if this is because that's how they set it up on purpose, or if it's an accident, but I can say for CERTAIN that I would order delivery from them more often if the full menu was available. (The delivery company that's used on their website is awful, it's called Zuppler and the customer service is terrible. I recommend using Postmates or just picking it up yourself.)"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this Lebanese restaurant! I'm half-Armenian and have found it very hard to find good middle eastern food in Las Vegas. Paymons was my favorite for a long time until I tried this restaurant. This restaurant doesn't dumb down, \"Americanize\" their food. Lots of spices.......delicious spices! Try the meat dolma (grape leaves), lamb shawarma, and best of all......the lentil soup!!!! Freaking best lentil, if not any soup I've ever had! It will just smack you with how good it is! Loads of spices and lemon! Yum!!"}
{"text":"I had the shrimp scampi, salad, hummus and the mint lemonade. I loved every part of my meal! Also, Lana was a great host!"}
{"text":"Khoury's is one of my fave Mediterranean places to go, not only because the yummy food, but the friendly service that they give here ~ they make you feel right at home & always welcome you with open arms. I've been going here for years now & love the fact that it's a quaint & charming place to have dinner. Also, I love that they have bellydancing music playing in the background with a mixture of some pop & traditional music as well. Love their veggie kabobs, bread (delish! Reminds my Moroccan friends of back home in Morocco too!) as well as my Lebanese friends too! Come give this place a try! Love it! :) Dounya is the BEST ever!!!"}
{"text":"This place is still very good. I ordered the Kafta and it was delicious. The server was very nice. The place was clean. And they served an awesome selection of alcohol.

I don't like the paper table clothes to protect the real table clothes but, it's okay."}
{"text":"Great lunch experience here today. Logan did an excellent job and his knowledge of the menu was very helpful."}
{"text":"Place very clean , food is good little hi on price , but it good Arabic food , atmosphere very nice people friendly I will go back again ."}
{"text":"Love this place. April and the rest of the staff are always attentive.  The cooks put out consistently fresh, good quality food.  I come here several times a week. Can't get enough of this bomb Salads and foods!"}
{"text":"What can I say about what a my favorite Mediterranean restaurants. Khoury's provides such a wonderful experience.  I started off with the jalapeno hummus which is absolutely a flavor explosion in your mouth with the heat in the creaminess of the hummus little drizzle of olive oil. The fresh pita bread they put hot on the table. Next was a complimentary salad had a vegetarian pizza which is outstanding and of course my all-time favorite the Farooj chicken with garlic parsley lemon potatoes carrots and broccoli melt-in-your-mouth with Chris penis one of my favorite dishes of all time love this place please try it when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Their shrimp kabobs are so good!    Love the rice that it comes with and the fresh bread.   Their hummus and baba ganoushi is yummy too!"}
{"text":"1 star was for the delicious food. 4 stars off for the underhanded way they advertise their 50% off farooj yelp deal and poor service. The original menu item, farooj, costs about $15.95 and comes with a side salad. After you show the lady the yelp deal, the resulting check comes out to this: $7.96 after the 50% off but then charges you for the side salad $3.95. Then I asked the lady about the extra charge and she said the deal was only for the chicken and not for the salad and if it's an issue, then next time I order the farooj, I should tell them to not give me the side salad. The funny thing about this whole situation is that if I ordered the farooj without the Yelp deal, the salad would have been FREE. This is NOT about the extra money but the principal of the matter. The purpose of a deal is to get people to come in, try how good the food is, and come back - not the opposite. This was my first time and regrettably the last. I thoroughly enjoyed the food but the service was extremely slow and we weren't even given water or pita bread until after another table seated after us was served first. Sad."}
{"text":"We went on Father's Day and it seemed that they were short staffed and really busy. It took about one hour to finally get our food. I was thinking of giving them 3 stars but they redeemed themselves with their great service and high quality food. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"The kibbi nayi is the best. It is always very good but a little expensive. Although I've tried other things on the menu I always go back to kibbi nayi. Their fresh pita bread is good. Overall they got good food."}
{"text":"So I ate here today at the suggestion of a friend and although I can't say anything was wrong with my food, it just didn't taste good. It's a nice place and my hopes were high, but I was very disappointed. I LOVE Mediterranean food and sadly this was lacking. At first I was very excited to see a brick oven in the front making fresh pita, after a while I wondered why they didn't open the front door to let some cool air in as they must not make a habit of using the air con. It was warm inside. Back to the pita, it sucked, worse I've had. To me it's kind of the cornerstone of the meal and it was bad. How do you screw up pita?!? Sadly for them I won't be  back....."}
{"text":"Khourys is the best! I'm from Michigan originally. When I moved out to Vegas in 2005, I was so happy to find authentic Lebanese cuisine. Not only does it remind me of home, but possibly is even better than what I grew up knowing was the best place in town. (The grape leaves rival my grandma's, but I'll never tell her that) Khourys is family owned and has a great hospitable vibe. The hummus and homemade cracked wheat pita bread is amazingly dangerous. I have to control myself so I have room for the rest of the meal! Everything is fresh and healthy, not greasy I've been a regular for years and even though Khourys has moved a little farther away from me, I will still make the drive to get my fix. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE PLACE. 
Kept us waiting for too long. Nobody bothered to take our orders or even justify the wait."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I ordered the lentil soup (yum!!) and the stuffed grape leaves. Both were super tasty, but the excruciatingly slow service killed the experience for me."}
{"text":"Combo kabob and lentil soup was AMAZING!!! Staff was super friendly and courteous, they really helped to break down the menu. Restaurant is very clean and inviting, overall I would highly recommend and will be coming back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Khoury's is wonderful. Good food and friendly service. 

I love the food. The freshly baked pita starts your meal off nicely. We always get hummus for dipping and the two are so good I'm always in a good mood by the time the mains arrive. My wife is vegan and I haven't met an animal that wasn't tasty. So this place is great for us with a big variety. I've liked everything I've tried. 

I love the wait staff. So friendly. Sometimes kitchen gets backed up and a little slow for what you'd expect based on dine in capacity. Could be take out or catering, not really sure and only reason for holding back 5th star. 

Friends over in this area always told us we would the place, we finally drove over after hearing about it for a year. Now we go at least once a month."}
{"text":"The food is good but it's very pricey, small lentil soup for $9.00! The shawarma plate has more potatoes than meat. The bread was good."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I grew up in Detroit and there are a lot of fine Creek establishments in Detroit. I love Greek food. I didn't even get to try the food here because the lady greeting me at the door had such a nasty demeanor instead of a smile she had a bitter look on her face. She asked if I was here to pick up food like as if I was there for some kind of a delivery service or something like that. When she found out I wasn't she had was all smiles and I find that absolutely in comprehensible. I had to explain to her that people that might do deliveries could actually be customers to so how you greet everybody matters. Any short don't come here don't waste your time I'm sure there's plenty of other good Creek options out there."}
{"text":"THE BEST HUMMUS I've ever had!  Like ever. Fresh, healthy options. We love the catering options."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, amazing environment. All around greatness! The staff is so nice and it's a family run business! Best Mediterranean restaurant in Las Vegas by far! My favorite place to come any day! Sana is my favorite server!"}
{"text":"I just can not get over how delicious this food is! BY FAR the best Mediterranean restaurant in Las Vegas. Farooj and chicken kabab are my favorite dishes. The new location is beautiful and the service is very friendly and fast! I come eat here regularly and never get bored of it, never have any problems. My friend is vegetarian and khourys gives so many choices that are vegetarian, we both love going there! Amazing restaurant! Just perfect"}
{"text":"It was definitely good. Randomly decided to try this place and was worth the try. Food was delicious.  

Reason for 4 stars is because food took a long time when hardly any customers were there.  They also forgot one of my dishes and brought it at the end of our dinner versus asking us whether we still wanted it or not. 

Will give it another try and maybe service will be better."}
{"text":"The place looks like you are going to get the best Mediterranean food in Vegas, Buy it is not. I didn't like the food at all. The Gyro was the worst I have ever had.  And silly me for ordering Pizza from a Mediterranean place. One word Gross. I will Not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious. The restaurant is very nice & clean. Their jalepeno hummus is out of this world!
They have gone above and beyond to make things right after a few service errors. I'm very satisfied that my voice was heard & that they were willing to correct everything."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Great happy hour, great drinks, great food, great service. I'm obsessed with falafels right now, and I gotta tell yah, they're amazing here! Their pita bread is ALWAYS hot & fresh too. I try to come here at least once or twice a week. I will also recommend the pitcher of sangria if you're with your friends, it's refreshing and you can get 10-12 glasses from it!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place. I'd tell all my friends & family about it, always take everyone there when they were in town. But... I recently visited the new location with my boyfriend & the service was HORRIBLE! Food was still great but if you have 2+ hours to eat then go for it. Not joking when I say it took 25 min to get a drink or a refill & around 45 min for food. I used to make the drive to eat there, but I will spend my time & money elsewhere now. Side note: I have also used Khoury's for catering in the past, but now I must say I'm hesitant to do any business with them. Side note #2: My boyfriend is pissed I'm leaving even 2 stars lol"}
{"text":"Just placed and picked up our take out order. I am updating my review because the service from our server was awesome! Miss LANA is new but very sweet and made the wait for our order enjoyable... Now we are so excited to dig in... YUMM

Bought a pint of garlic sauce for $10! lol
The small sauce container size is $1."}
{"text":"Nice to find a different taste for lunch. Noodles, salads or subs can only go so far. The Lebanese sandwich is tantalizing with grilled onions and almost a chutney flavor.  Most tables filled and a good lunch turn - a good sign.  Close to my office for regular lunches and so good, I'll venture across town for dinner."}
{"text":"Khoury's I make my family come here every time I visit them.  You are by far one of the best med food places I have been!

Food:  Amazing!  They make their own pita bread (you can see it rising in the oven), which comes with zatar.  The selection of appetizers is fairly large, I have tried the falafel, baba ghanoush, and hummus.  Everything I have had has been wonderful.  
The main courses were all delicious as well, I have gotten the veggie kabob and the fatosh salad.  My sister has gotten the moussaka on several occasions and really likes it..so if you like moussaka it may be worth a try.

The service is really good, the people are really nice and attentive. I will keep coming back and recommend you try as well."}
{"text":"Khoury's used to be my favorite restaurant but ever since they relocated and hired a new staff, THEY SUCK!!! The quality of the food is still ok but the service is super slow and when I left I forgot my to-go bag, i called once I realized it was gone which was maybe 10 min later and they had already disposed of it, could you imagine if I had a full meal for my husband...which I usually do, I would've lost my crap. I almost did with the retarded girl on the phone. Once I told her I left my to go bag her immediate response was, \"I don't see anything on the tables\", instead of saying, let me check with the other server to see if he set it aside. Let's not forget that my server never once filled my water cup and took forever just to check back with me every so often. I was a party of 1 and it literally took me over an hour to get out of that place because the service is so slow. Oh and the restaurant was practically empty with 2 SERVERS! GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER KHOURY's!! Needless to say, I won't be recommending this place to anyone and will only go at my own risk when I crave grape leaves. SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT"}
{"text":"I moved and I live a bit further from this place, but my bf and I still make it a point to come here.  We love the free bread and dipping sauce... zytar, I think that's what they call the sauce.  It's so good, that I could just eat the bread and sauce for meal if I wanted to, lol.
Our go to meal which we never get tired of is the veggie kabobs.  The sauce that they use on the veggies is to die for!! It's so flavorful with a lemony tangy taste, that we ask for a side of it so we have more to put on the veggies and rice.   It also comes with lentil soup and it is so good!! It's by far, the best lentil soup in Vegas.  It's chunky all the veggies and potatoes in it and it's also very flavorful like a tangy flavor.  I wish I could duplicate this soup at my house.

Also, the staff is very friendly and the ambiance is good.  I love the Lebanese decorations and they also have hookah which you can smoke on their outside patio.
 Give this place a try, you'll love it."}
{"text":"La comida es libanesa echa con mucho amor y sabor 
Deben de ver el menú tan grande que tienen y el buen servicio"}
{"text":"I love this place. Being from that part of the world, I know what is good and what isn't. This place is good trust me. I live nearby and go all the time."}
{"text":"The food was all fresh and fantastic. I have no idea what is in the green Lebanese hot sauce but it is fantastic.  Hummus was excellent as well. I would definitely go back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is just fantastic.  Lamb gyro is perfectly seasoned with a little bit of crispiness on the outside and tender on the inside. The pita bread is fresh baked for you and always amazing.  If you like mediterranean food, and I do, this is a great option."}
{"text":"What a marvelous selections of Middle Eastern appetizers. Everything ordered by our friends was excellent! Great for getting together with friends, good for lunch.  Wonderful service by server April.
Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"Great place! Clean and friendly staff , great for brunch , nice environment , wine and the food is great totally have to come and check it out"}
{"text":"Really awesome food! We ordered fried goat cheese, a falafel sandwich, combo Kabob, and tabouleh salad. It was all really good. The service was great too."}
{"text":"There was another review on here that said it best: 3 strikes out. We keep trying this place because the food is excellent (particularly their jalapeno hummus), but there is now little reason for us to come back. The service is terrible. Yesterday, there was only one waitress and at least 5-6 bussers, so you can imagine how thin her service was stretched. There were people trying to get her attention all around, so I felt for her. I understand that sometimes restaurants are understaffed. When she finally got around to us and took our order, we ordered the Shawarma Plate with Gyro meat, which we have ordered 2-3 times before with no problems.

When our food was brought out, it was chicken instead of gyro meat. We left it untouched and waited almost 10 minutes for the waitress to come check on us, and we let her know that our order was wrong. She spoke to me in a condescending voice and said that Shawarma is chicken, explained to me what gyro meat is (which I know), and we should have ordered the Gyro Plate. According to the menu, the Shawarma Plate can be \"lamb, chicken, OR gyro.\" She didn't really acknowledge it as her mistake, even when we showed her in print that the menu says \"or Gyro.\" When she brought out our correct order, she apologized and loudly exclaimed \"Here is your GYRO PLATE.\" Well, there is no Gyro Plate on the menu, and I will reiterate that Khoury's Shawarma Plate advertises Gyro as one of the meat options. On top of all that, she never brought us drink refills after promising to do so, and I watched her bring drinks to other tables in the meantime.

Until they get their customer service together, which has been deplorable on previous visits as well, we will not be returning. It's really a shame because their food is so tasty, but I do not appreciate being talked down to when the waitress took our order down incorrectly."}
{"text":"Absolutely, hands down amazing to every homemade detail: bread, olive oil, soup (secret add: jalepeno puree), lamb (not gamey at all), hummus, moroccan mint tea, Turkish/Arab coffee, kunafa...We had it all. Lana was particularly sweet and helpful when I wasn't sure of what to get. I loved all of her recommendations. We will definitely be back and bring family and friends, both local and visiting."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've eaten the delightful food at your restaurant...I drove to the old location as a loyal customer a while back and was disappointed not to find it open! I'm thrilled to find your new location and will be in for dinner soon. 

 Tonight I ordered through Urber Eats, long business day... The food is outstanding and fresh as always! The hot pita Amazing. 
I loved that the food was packet so well , it was still hot and nothing mixed together. Delivery was great too, took care to properly deliver the food.  The flavors and the meat were outstanding. 

The lamb gyro was a so juicy and perfection of flavor.The baba (eggplant) 
was the best I've ever had, smooth and delicious. Thank you for the desert, I finished the box...I'll be in for some more, I'm now addicted! Fill--o--doe desert is a must have. ( does it come with a gym membership? Lol) 


Thanks for the wonderful food and congratulations on your new location."}
{"text":"The BF and I came with our friends who live on this side of town. I've heard good things about the food and they said there were certain things they order that is quite nice there so we decided to give it a go. 

We decided to do the dinner for two. Its' $39.99 and you get a choice of a soup or sald each, a shared appetizer, a entree each, and a dessert each. It seemed to be the way to go for dinner, since the prices are more during dinner than lunch...but it seems the portions look to be the same in pics? I don't get why places do that. 

Lentil Soup - pretty good actually. Lighter type broth and had some spinach and the squeeze of lemon made it quite good. 
Greek Salad - pretty plentiful and the components were fresh. A bit overdressed, but still good. 
Our friends got other kinds of soup, chicken and a beef and rice one. 

For appetizer we got- 
Baba ganoush - pretty solid, a bit smoky and nice texture. I like that there was a bit of pink pickles, I wish we ordered a plate of pickles. 
Hummus - our friends got this and it was decent flavor and consistency, but the baba ganoush was the winner. 

They handmake their own puffy pita which is a plus, and ask for refills. They give some olive oil with zaatar. 

Beef kebob - it was just OK. It could use more flavoring and was rather small pieces to be charging what they do. On pictures, it seemed that kebobs were much plumper back then. 
Moussaka - it was a vegetarian one, and wasn't like a traditional stacked style but more a stuffed eggplant with chickpeas and tomato sauce. It's their own take that reminds me of Lebanese stuffed eggplant. It was good for vegan version, but disappointing that I was expecting it to be something else. The thing that was crappy is our friend LOVES their moussaka here and always ordered it - when it had meat in it. He was so disappointed he sent it back because it was not really something he was aware changed. I don't get why they would get rid of a classic. I know they got requests for more vegetarian options, but that sucks for everyone else. Could be in addition to, not instead of. Stuffing a eggplant with meat mix vs the chickpeas isn't too difficult. Please, don't let vegans ruin a good thing. 

We got the baklava to go. It was a plentiful serving of 4 little rolls each which was nice. It was pretty decent and oddly we got two different batches of one crispy and one not as crispy and we all had different opinions which we preferred. 

Service was odd. She was nice in a kinda awkward way of trying to make chit chat, but was definitely struggling to serve 3 tables with basics. We ordered fries and hoped for bread ASAP since there was a slightly cranky baby with us too. Our bread was sitting on the pas for a while so it was more crunchy than fluffy when we got the first batch. Boo. It was also a wait for the bill even though it was clear mom and baby were gone, my BF was getting fresh air and we needed.

For having spent $100 for dinner for 4, we expected far better. It seems my friends who are regulars even seem to be a bit upset and don't want to be back when that particular lady is working (they seem to only get bad service with her) and hope that the moussaka will be back. I live far enough that I'm not sure if I will make the effort to come back, specially since DW is next door. Maybe to-go of some baba ganoush."}
{"text":"Five Star Mediterranean the staff is well educated on the food they are serving and they give you five star service.  They play authentic background music and it's he presentation is fabulous 
Jalapeño hummus is amazing 

From the Fava beans  to the lamb ..delicious 

Lunch get a carb free sandwich.  Amazing. 

I've dined here lunch and dinner about ten times and it's consistently perfect.  If I could give it a bonus star I would"}
{"text":"Months later I was finally able to
Get back to Khourys ... So glad I did !
A totally different experience - beautiful patio. Delicious food, lovely service and gracious owner !!

We definitely will be back when at our LV home !
 Also ran into our neighbor from
Across the street - obviously a very popular spot !!!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is one of the better Mediterranean sit downs on the west side of town.  The fresh hot stone oven cooked pita bread is to die for.  You can probably just come here for that.   The hummus and babaganoush is also pretty smooth and flavorful.  They use some kinds of different spice, had a slightly different taste.  I can't tell what spice or what it is but it's still good.  I ordered the mixed plate chicken and beef kabobs and my date ordered the parsley salad.   The kabobs were nice and flavorful, not super dry at all."}
{"text":"The food and service is so good at this place we love it !! Everything is so delicious Opa !! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Opaaaaaaaaaaa ! Opaaaaaa!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the meat in mine and my friend's sandwiches were a little gamier than we'd prefer. I love Mediterranean and eastern cuisine, so this is the only restaurant there is for a few miles that I'd go to regularly."}
{"text":"The food has always been great however the service not the best, that changed tonight. Simi our server was amazing, she was on top of it and always with a friendly smile...

Thanks again for u great service Simi."}
{"text":"This place gives you a bang for your buck!  I ordered the All Natural Chicken sandwich.  Ok this thing had french fries on it!  Love!  These were homemade potatoes in and on the side.  The pita bread is delish!  It's a filling meal seriously.  If you haven't tried Khoury's you should. My only complaint is that the chicken was slightly dry."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mediterranean in Las Vegas. Everything about this place is fantastic! The pita bread is the best I've ever had and the filet kabobs were amazing.

Service and ambiance was also fantastic!"}
{"text":"Khoury's was good the first time I went sense then I live close enough I've gone three more times each time not as good as the first, including the food.

The service also was really slow. I have deff. had a better pita. The first time I went though I really liked it. I am not sure if they'll improve or not but I tried enough times I don't think I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout here for the first time tonight. We got the house mezza to share it was absolutely amazing so fresh and incredibly flavorful. I can't wait to actually eat in house and have the whole Khoury's experience."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and started with a very friendly and genuine greeting. The food was good and well presented. I did not like my lunch dish but I did enjoy the hummus and pita appetizer. I hope to get something different on my next visit that will be spectacular"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly  service, try the combo plate meat.   Yogurt drink is a must ."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and while I always enjoy my meal the one thing that seems to be off is the service, slow and forgetful. Otherwise it's a lovely meal. Good for dates or causal dinner with a friend. Must try their freshly baked pita bread!

So, I tried the Lentil soup and a Lamb Sharawarma walnut salad, which is basically sliced tender lamb combined with feta walnuts, lemon and peeper. The lentil soup is absolutely delicious and I found myself satisfied with this dish alone. The salad was bigger than I thought it would be, it was good, but not sure I would opt for the lamb walnut salad, maybe next time I'll try chicken. I ordered a glass of Sangria, well made, not sweet or strong, just perfect! 

They have happy hour Monday-Friday from 3-6. There's never been a wait and they have spacious seating. I'm definitely making this place a regular."}
{"text":"I hate to say this because the food is relatively good, but the service is absolutely horrible! I just left the restaurant the owner was standing in front and as I walked up to get my check after sitting there for 20 minutes completely unattended he asked me if I was there to pick up a to-go order?

Again, good food but not good enough to warrant the horrible service that I have experienced!  This was was my fourth and last visit!"}
{"text":"The traditional Lebanese appetizers are the restaurant's best dishes."}
{"text":"The appetizers were tasty and generous.  The main course took so long to make it to the table the 4 of us totally forgot what we ordered.  And we only had gyros!  Will I come back?  Probably not.  But if you're in the neighborhood it's not a bad way to go."}
{"text":"We were in the area on a Monday night and it was recommended we go to DW Bistro on Ft Apache and Patrick.  They happen to be closed on Mondays, so we walked down to Khoury's Mediterranean right before happy hour ended and had some of the best Lebanese/Mediterranean food we have ever had in this town.  Happy hour had $2.00 beer, $5.00 Sangria and some appetizers.  We tried the regular hummus and the regular french fries.  The hummus came with three large hot puffy fresh pita breads that were so good, it was unbelievable. Both apps were great, the fries freshly cut and fried with skins on....YUM!  We actually ordered the Meat Combination plate and shared it, which gave us a great adventure in new tastes and was plenty of food - in fact we took some home.  I have to say it was the best rice I have ever had anywhere, just so nutty and flavorful.  The next day I took leftovers to work and someone asked me what it was because there were so many flavors she smelled in the kitchen.  Next time we are on that part of town, we will be back."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas on our bi-annual show and hike trip and on a way back from our hike at Red Rock using Yelp and looking for something healthy, found this gem  so decided to stop by for late lunch.

The place was basically empty, however, the staff was very friendly, alert and welcoming.

We ordered couple of Peroni beers and the waitress suggested their Lebanese beer (which I have never had before) so ended up trying it- it was as good as she described. Then we had the chicken gyro and lamb shawarma- we ordered those with salads instead of fries and their home garlic dressing is to die for.

Before the meal they gave us fresh baked bread and homemade dipping saude- so good and fresh/authentic.

The bill was very reasonable for the huge portions with such a fresh ingredients and great customer service.

we will go back here each time we are hiking in Vegas for sure. If you are lookign for authentic food, great service and great value- you must try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch. Delicious warm grape leaves, Greek salad with chicken Schwarma fresh and tasty. The jalapeño hummus is what keeps me coming back though! It's a must try. Lunch was Tooped off by our friendly waitress April."}
{"text":"Would never recommend ordering takeout. Multiple times has taken them OVER an hour to finish your small takeout order. Dont offer takeout if you take over and hour to prepare the order."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive as this style cuisine is new for me but we had a business \"family style dinner\" here and I was impressed! The food was great and the service was awesome as well."}
{"text":"The best lamb gyro I have ever had. Great service, great location. The menu has a great selection of different items. I'm looking forward to trying some of the traditional dishes I haven't seen before."}
{"text":"I like Mediterranean food. Khoury's catered our meeting. The food came on time. 

Chicken Skewer:
Mildly flavored and perfectly cooked - not dry. Has red and green bell peppers, mushrooms and onions. Onions were a bit raw. 3/5

Beef Skewer:
I was very disappointed with this. Grilled meat is hard to screw up. Though tender, the beef was poorly seasoned so it didn't have flavor. The onions were bordering on raw. 1/5

Hummus and Pita Bread:
Their hummus is more lemony than other places which isn't a bad thing. The warm pita bread was great. It wasn't heavy or doughy. 4/5

Baklava:
Light, flaky and sweet - just the way it should be. Not generous on the nuts and filling though. 3/5

The rice was a hit and so was the salad. It's not the best place for kabobs or other Mediterranean food but it's not awful."}
{"text":"Today I ordered to pick up for my co-workers and I and the food was just awful. We had the garlic chicken sandwiches... Im not even over exaggerating when I say none of us ate the sandwiches. There was so much straight garlic paste on it , it was unbearable. You would think the chicken would be seasoned with garlic not put garlic paste all over the chicken and call it garlic chicken sandwich with warm soggy pickles and 
awful fries. The quality of the chicken was bad to.

The french fries on the side were also a let down. All I had was Basically Potato skins. So disappointed that all the money we spent on the food went to waste. Aside from these 3 sandwiches we also ordered another 2 meals that also went to waste. So unfortunate. I would recommend who ever put the food together if you wouldn't eat it don't serve it.  $65.00 down the drain."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Khoury's while we were in town on business. Food was good as was the service, We had shish kabob and meat stuffed grape leaves on the dinner for two menu. We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Super cute Mediterranean spot in Summerlin area. Very casual but has nice decor & greenery inside. 

The food was good, not amazing. We ordered a bunch of appetizers including the feta fries, labni, hummus. Hummus was yummy, super creamy. The labni was very fresh and refreshing. They also have complimentary freshly baked pita bread that is delish with an olive oil and spice dip. 

I ordered the Greek salad for my main meal since I was so full already, but it was so so. The dressing wasn't the best 

I would go back though. Definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I have been here a number of times and never had a disappointing meal. Once we ordered Kafka and a Greek Salad for dinner and they brought us Lamb and hummus.

I am not really one to eat much outside my comfort zone, but this place is amazing. I ate there recently and had the lamb and hummus. All of the flavors were perfect together. We also love this place because it has outdoor and indoor seating and is very friendly to our kid. I recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"I go through phases where I Yelp stalk my friends to find out where I should be eating. Thanks to a particularly inviting review from Robyn L., I made my way over to Khoury's. Of course, it is located near another restaurant I have been wanting to try. Oh well, one at a time. 

Khoury's has a cozy intimate feeling with rich colors that soothes the soul. Sitting in the middle of the restaurant gave us a perfect view of the oven fresh bread being made and the kitchen window. There is no viewing into the cooking area, which is a bummer. Between my friend and I, we had ordered the hummus to start. With a check in on Yelp, it is free. +1 for the pickled vegetables and whole chickpeas garnish. My friend ordered the Kafta, a ground sirloin sausage, which they grill and serve on a bed of rice. The starch was cooked perfectly and possessed so much flavor. The Kafta was good, but not moan inducing. I ordered the Lamb Swarma and it got illicit in the dining room. The noises were almost pornographic, at least in my head. The meat was tender, not gamy, and packed with complex flavor. Served with a side of rice and tahini, it was good with their warm bread. For $3.95 each, we added a Khoury's and a Greek Salad. The namesake greens was a simple lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber number, but the dressing packed a tart punch. The lemony bite is what I crave in a salad. Forget using all that oil, just give me a pucker inducing dressing. The Greek was just as good. It had a similar base as the first salad but with feta, olives, and the classic vinaigrette. 

Add a couple glasses of red wine and we were chatting up a storm while enjoying the atmosphere. Around dinner time, it got busy quick. With one hostess and one waitress, they handled the crowd well. While they alternated seating and greeting, no one was left unattended to. 

They have a $40 four course meal for two which caught my eye. This will have to be investigated on my next visit."}
{"text":"My first time here and I'm definitely writing this place down to come back to! Everything was SOOO good!! My husband and I got the dinner for 2 and each got the lentil soup, then shared the Samboosak (crazy good!!), then we got the Kibbi and Stuffed Cabbage (both delicious but our fav was the Kibbi!) and for dessert we ordered the Kanafi-super yummy and sweet! I recommend everything we ordered but I can't imagine anything from here not being delicious!"}
{"text":"My first time eating here. I had the Farooj. They had a great deal on it if you checked in on yelp. The food was great, i had the hummus with pita bread, it is handmade, and delish. The Farooj itself was amazing the chicken was juicy, the skin was nice and crispy, the sauce was really citrusy & veggies were nicely cooked. 

Unfortunately the only thing that prevented me from giving them 5 stars was the service. They we're nice, but they lacked in refilling drinks, and retouching the table to see how we were doing. Other than that I give them 4 out of 5. I would still go back to try other options."}
{"text":"We love Khoury's! We have eaten here for nine years, and the food is truly one of our favorites.  We have Enjoyed them in house, take-out & for catering. Megan is excellent & professional at catering set-ups.  The food is a fresh Mediterranean; our favorites are the farouj chicken and the lamb Shawarma. If you have to tried them, you're missing out on delicious food!!! Go try them....you will enjoy!!"}
{"text":"2 stars is being generous for our lunch experience today. The food was mediocre and the service just plain sucked. My wife arrived before me, ordered hummus, water and our lunches. I arrived a few minutes later and the waitress, Elissia on our ticket, conveniently ignored me and me needing a drink. She never asked how the hummus was, pretty good actually, and she seemed completely disinterested in our dining experience.

She brought us our meals with limp, barely warm fries to go with our gyro and chicken schwarma sandwich. Again, I had to ask her for ketchup to go with my fries, isn't that basic server stuff, along with more water. I also had to ask for extra gyro sauce, tzatziki, as it's quite watered down tasting and should be much thicker. Along with that the gyro had maybe 1/2 the meat that one would normally associate with a gyro.

We were definitely unimpressed and I asked my wife to remind me the next time I mention going to Khoury's to prompty tell me how much I disliked our first 2 attempts dining at this restaurant. Over priced, mediocre food and garbage service."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean Restaurant in Las Vegas!!! Fresh Pita with jalapeño hummus to start...wow the bread was hot and warm and the hummus was creamy and smooth the BEST hummus I've had ever! Chicken Garlic soup should be permanently on the menu...wow taste like moms! Farooj by far my favorite!"}
{"text":"By far the best Lebanese food if you can't make a trip to Lebanon. The manooshee is the most amazing manoosheee I have ever had outside of Lebanon. Everything is fresh and delicious. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere great and the food mouth watering! My new favorite! Five stars"}
{"text":"I always have a soft spot for Mediterranean food, but this was my first time eating Lebanese style. Absolutely loved the family style ambience here, but also how incredibly busy they can be. They started our table off with pita bread and olive oil, only the pita was humongous! They are freshly baked near the front counter as well. Just as the ambience, the kafte and shawarma platters also seemed family-style; so many portions! The meat was so tender and delicious, definitely try their gyro. We ended our meals with baklava rolls and Mediterranean coffee, which was the perfect blend of sweet and fragrant. 

Would've rated 5 stars if it wasn't for the slow, almost disregarded service from our waiter. We waited for our entrees for a good half an hour as well, don't know if that was the kitchen's fault but it was hard to enjoy anything before our meals arrived."}
{"text":"When the question of \"what do you want to eat?\", this is one of the first places that come to mind. Aside from the convienance of it being located close to my house, the food is really good! Quiant atmosphere,  and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Their made one of the best pita bread in town. Always fresh made to order. You can eat as much as you like. Customer service is good. Food is not bad too."}
{"text":"Woke up this morning to an email from the owner asking me and my classmates to NOT come in anymore because of YELP reviews!   I think it's completely ridiculous that because I warned future patrons about cash payments that I am asked not to come in.  I still stated the food was delicious but because I'm using Yelp as Yelp is to be used I am no longer welcome which is fine by us!  After so many trips and inconsistency we all are fed up anyway!   After every visit where we used cash payment we loved the food so much we decided against cash payment and just paying with a card but this is bonkers!   Attached is photo of message from owner!"}
{"text":"Nice relaxed atmosphere, no rush to feed you and get you out of the door. 
All food is amazing, Fresh bread, Tabouli, with a side of green hot sauce and a Pomegranate Sangria........ 
Gotta go.............headed there now!!!"}
{"text":"I am Lebanese and this is the closet to our kind of cooking. Bread is wonderful the hummus, and chicken swarmah are great. They also make stuffed cabbage and grape leaves. They are consistent and help is very friendly. Atmosphere is lovely and they have a mix of Lebanese and American music. Great place!"}
{"text":"It was nice to try a new place, but I don't think any of us were impressed with our food too much. We had the grape leaves for appetizer, I am not a fan anyhow so I did not partake, but the girls did not finish them and said they were not very good. I ordered a Shwarma, which here is different than any I have had before, just meat and onions? I packed it up to go. My friends ordered cabbage wrapped meat...I am not sure what they are called. They packed everything to go as well, no one was really a fan of anything we ordered. We asked for some containers to take our tzaziki sauce to go, instead the server brought us out three large to go sauces and charged us each a dollar fifty for them. It was an interesting experience, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love the hummus here and the lentil soup. Best I've had. The Chicken Shawarma is really good too."}
{"text":"We had an awesome dinner with great service. Highly recommend this place. My 4yr old son loved the food (lentil soup was his favorite) and had a blast drawing on the table. We got the house mezza which they were happy to make vegan for us and we each got a cup of the lentil soup. Everything was super good. Our waitress was really sweet and moved quick to get our drinks in for happy hour! Great experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat at or get takeout from here 2-3x a week. It is our favorite Mediterranean restaurant and can't say enough great things about it.

The fresh baked pita, hummus grape leaves, whatever we have ordered we loved. But the Sangria is the BEST. We love to sit outside on the patio to relax and enjoy the food and drinks. 

The service at time can be slow, but we actually enjoy this aspect of the restaurant. We are never in a rush or feel rushed to place our order or leave as soon as we are done. We normally sit there for 2+ hours.

And Brisia is absolutely amazing and love when she is our waitress."}
{"text":"My first time here. I had the Greek salad with chicken, very tasty, a lot of flavor. The Jalapeño hummus was excellent. April our server was very nice too."}
{"text":"Ive been here about 12 times.  The food is always good!  The service is questionable sometimes though.  I will say it is an issue of turnover and inexperience, not rudeness.  Occasionally slow and inattentive but not unpleasant.  The last two times I had a great server!  I've had the kibi, mousaka, kafta,  combos, and most of the apps.   Everything has always tasted great!   Fresh ingredients and the portion sizes are perfect."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our out-of-town guests here. Biggest mistake! No one else was there, bread and lamb were hard as a rock, and the service was horrible! It was a complete waste of money because we all went home hungry, and shameful to have taken our guests there. We will never return to this place."}
{"text":"*****update below 

Food is delicious. Absolutely have to stop in and try. Service was slow, it took forever to get a refill on water. Maybe because we sat outside. 


Updated****

Today we visited again, they weren't on top of things. Dirty tables sit around us during the entire time we were there. I requested hummus which the waitress brought out long after I ate my pita-bread. Speaking of pita, I had one that was more like a pita chip and one that was still doughy. The Pepsi was flat tasting and we had empty glasses for longer than we should have. 

The food wasn't the best today either. 

Lastly, they got my husbands order wrong.  Even after having to come back and ask him a second time what it was he had ordered.  Smh."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh my gooodness! I haven't had Lebanese food like this ever and I feel like my first round was super ideal! They have a wood oven fired up baking endless rounds of pita to perfection. They serve the pitas as a starter while you wait for your food. I've had pita from many Greek-type places but this is by far my favorite because it was doughy whereas other pitas I've experienced were thin, dry, and reminded me of cardboard. Definitely order a side of hummus for this amazing ness! I came for dinner with a big group of 8 so we ordered practically the entire menu haha 

Many appetizers to start, I highly suggest you go for whatever your eyes desire cause these little dishes are the best part of the meal! We had two kinds of salads, which I couldn't stop picking at to the end. They were topped with beautiful Roma tomatoes. For an entree we shared a ginormous meat platter with an assortment of chicken kabobs and delicious lamb. Ask for tatziki sauce because it blends in phenomenally well with the meats! Everything felt and tasted incredibly authentic"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I crave their Lentil soup and the marinated veggies. Yum! Everything is always so fresh. I haven't had a thing there yet that I didn't like."}
{"text":"We had our family holiday pictures taken at a photo studio located in this same center, and after going to view our pictures we were ready for dinner. 

There are quite a few options in the area, but my Husband absolutely loves Mediterranean food. I looked at their menu online and we were quickly sold when we saw their 4 course menu for 2 people for $42.

We started with jalapeno hummus, which was really delicious. Then I had the house salad and my Hubby had the greek salad. Their house dressing is so good! We both ended up getting the gyro platter and were definitely not disappointed. Everything was piping hot and obviously very fresh. The portions were huge and everything (especially the rice!) was really yummy. We shared dessert (I don't remember the name, but it was different and very good).

Our server was very helpful and friendly. I got a glass of wine and my hubs had an iced tea and our total bill was less than $50. Overall, we were really impressed and found ourselves wishing they had a location closer to home in Henderson. Next time we are in the area, I definitely see us going back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant more than 30 times, I've used them for catering on a monthly basis for work, I've had lunch and dinner here and the food is great. However, ever since they moved locations...it has been a nightmare. I've have dined in and have done take out...the last time I dined in with my family was a few months ago-there were 5 of us and the restaurant was dead. It took 20 minutes to take our order. 15 minutes for the drinks to come, and over an hour for the food.  They have amazing pita bread and the waitress was unwilling to bring more as we were waiting for our food. Overall, a terrible dining experience.  Today I called in an order...she told me 25 minutes. I waited 30 minutes before I left the house thinking it would be ready. I got there and she said the food was ready but she just needed to bag the bread.  Well 30 minutes later she accomplished bagging the bread and all of the food was cold. The fries were cold and no microwave could revive them. No apologies, nothing. The back up for carry out was atrocious behind me.  I wish the 5 people behind me the best of luck. Hopefully they didn't order the fries.

Also a man in front of me obviously had surgery on his foot...the girl came out balancing multiple bags of pita bread to transfer to him for a balancing act....and then asks, \"would you like a bag?\" I didn't think she would have to ask, in fact she should have offered to take it to his car-idiotic"}
{"text":"Started off with the house lemonade which was perfect and far better than any made from a concentrate. The lentil soup was again the perfect flavor.
The hummus was good  but I don't think you should be able to call it hummus unless you make it with olive oil and theirs is made with sesame oil.  

Had a shawarma wrap made"}
{"text":"Really...really good. We took our kids, 2 girls...8 & 4, and a 5 month old for a faimly dinner night. The wait staff was kind and engaged the kids. The food was just what we were looking for. I would recommend this to anyone looking for quality Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! We had the beef and kafta kanob meals, hummus, lentil soup and baklava. Everything was so fresh and delicious.  Nice atmosphere and excellent service. The servers made it even more enjoyable for us. We highly recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable meal. I had two appetizers, the falafel and a meat-stuffed pastry. The falafel was the best that I've had in Vegas, fresh and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The turnovers were also good. I'll definitely go back again. Service was also top-notch."}
{"text":"Great food all around. The fresh brick pita bread they bring out is to die for, and the hummus is one of the best I've ever had at any Mediterranean or Middle Eastern restaurant."}
{"text":"Solid place to get your Mediterranean fix on!
Came here for Valentine's dinner. 
They had a set vday menu... 4 course meal.
Everything was on point from the pita bread, hummus, kafta, baklava and everything in between.
The Greek salad was heavy on the dressing and my mint tea was a little weak but they were accommodating and gave me more fresh mint. 
I think there were under staffed for vday dinner, service was okay.
If I'm in the area I wouldn't mind coming back for lunch and trying stuff from their regular menu.
Casual dining. No problems with parking."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! So authentic and full of flavor. Fresh baked pita that comes with the meal is to die for. Very nice atmosphere and friendly wait staff. Such a great experience, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We frequently  visit this restaurant and, up until now, gave it an excellent rating. We had guests in town and decided to take them here. The service was horrendous! The waitress was rude, slow, got our order wrong, and acted as if was our fault. I was very disappointed about the service, and the lack of care shown by the employees, including the owner who didn't even bother to come over, as she was definitely aware. I'm not sure if I will be returning."}
{"text":"Khoury's  caters our lunches and holiday party. Great food. We love it."}
{"text":"Really love eating at Khoury's! I used to dine at their old location and the food and service was incredible, when they moved locations the family went out to eat dinner there. Loved every second of it! Every experience since then has been nothing but great. My very picky 4 year old loves their grape leaves and their house salad and they even have a fun option for kids to shape their own bread! Family friendly and caring. Definitely have recommended this place to multiple people so far and not one has been disappointed. Even had their catering at a few events and everything is so spot on. The jalapeno hummus is a literal must try!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! 
So much homemade fresh pita bread! The lentil soup is really great too. I'm not familiar with Mediterranean food but everything I tried was superb! We got the mini house meza and I can't imagine getting the full size! It was a lot already.
Our server was super patient with us too. We love pretty far from this but it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Five Star all the way! Everything was fantastic. Ask for the Foohl served warm - delicious. Lamb is not gamey at all. Pita was amazing. Knafi is a must."}
{"text":"I love Khoury's new location very convenient for me plenty of parking and open late 11 pm on the weekends.  I love the Shawarma plate and seasoned fries.  The hot from the brick oven bread is excellent.  I didn't know that they also feature a happy hour from 3 -6 pm any kabob $5."}
{"text":"Such amazing food!! The jalapeño hummus is a must try! The fresh pita from the open brick oven is so delicious"}
{"text":"I went here on eevening after wanting to go for some time. I was very disappointed. Things were not very clean...tables had residue on them as if they use dirty rags to wipe them down, and then they miss a lot of food still stuck to the tables. I ordered steak and it was about as good as a steak you would expect at Denny's. But it was quite spendy! I will never go again!"}
{"text":"One of the best Lebanese I've ever had. Ordered the House Mezza, basically a selection of their appetizers. Fresh ingredients, subtle seasoning, well balanced. Great dining experience, will come here if I'm ever in LV again. They have vegan/vegetarian and meat dishes, also gluten free stuff. If you're vegetarian this is a great place to go with your omnivorous friends. Excellent service as well..."}
{"text":"Always have our family gatherings here and Khoury's never disappoints, from the service to the food... Perfection!"}
{"text":"The only reason this review is 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's a bit pricy. With that being said I would return again during happy hour when the prices are closer to reasonable because the food was great!"}
{"text":"How have I never reviewed this place as I eat here once a week, at least!  This is my go-to spot when I can't decide what to eat because I know I will leave happy!  I order the chicken kabobs every single time.  It is without a doubt THE BEST chicken that I have ever tasted!  Then smother it in gyro sauce (if you are a saucy kind of gal like me) and you have perfection in your mouth!  Your taste buds will be pleasantly satisfied!!  Then there is the GREEK SALAD, ahhhhhhhh!!!  The service is usually good.  My only complaint would be the inconsistencies.  The first time we visited they gave my kids unlimited lemonade and they brought baklava instead of rice pudding then the next time we visited they said that there were no refills on lemonade and the kids had to have rice pudding.  It has changed many times since we started visiting and it can be a little annoying.  Other than that I love this place!!"}
{"text":"New and improved!  The new location is convenient and I swear the food has stepped it up a notch.  

I always eat a Greek salad which is one of my favorite items along with gyro meat or the chicken kabab.

The kids love the gyro's and the gyro plates.  They have changed up the kids menu since moving so be sure to take notice that dessert is no longer included.

As of 2/26/16 I noticed that they are now able to serve alcohol.

This is a regular spot for us and will continue to be even though they moved farther down the road."}
{"text":"This place is apparently run by the same owner as Hedary's up on Sahara. Both have similar menus, except Khoury's is slightly more expensive. I like the bread better here, however. The free pita that they give and the dipping oil with spices is fantastic. The two definitely have better Mediterranean food than other restaurants in town, like Paymon's. I've had their specialty baked chicken, sandwiches, and moussaka so far. I've always been satisfied with what I order. The only time that I wasn't so impressed was with the house salad. It was rather plain. Otherwise, they serve good food and I agree with the other reviewer that their rice is delicious!"}
{"text":"The absolute best mediterranean restaurant in Las Vegas hands down.... everything is fantastic... been there many many times and never dissapointed... best hummus.. best drinks... best baklava... best homemade dishes.. best atmosphere! And the service is always on point...Dounya has been our server many times and is always a delight... great personality ..very attentive and knows her menu!

Brisia was our server this evening and she was the best as well... never wanted for anything... she was right on point with our sevice and so nice!

Great food is important ... but great service is just as important for us! Love this place!"}
{"text":"My family and I were very impressed with the food that Khoury's delivered to our home in Las Vegas.  The food was pre-ordered about 1 week in advance and we had 0 issues.  

I yelped Khoury's Mediterranean Restaurant and the reviews were not only positive, there were tons of them!  I emailed Khoury's a \"pre-order\" list and when I followed up with a phone call, I was able to get the pricing right away.  There wasn't any beating around the bush so that was helpful.  We connected the day of the order to confirm the delivery, which was awesome.  The food was delivered on time, the gal that delivered the food even helped us carry the food to the 2nd level.

We would definitely eat at Khoury's again!  We ordered the family catering of chicken, falafel, rice and salad.  The Falafel was a bit dry but everything else was so good!"}
{"text":"We came here because it was convenient, having just walked out of Settebello a few doors away.  Because we had already had drinks and a taste of the awful pizza there, we weren't all that hungry, so we decided to stick with shawarma sandwiches - lamb for me, chicken for Mr. Cluck, 9.95 each.  Even so, we were served a basket of warm, puffy pita with some olive oil/balsamic for dipping.

Our server was Simi, a delightful young woman from Israel, who couldn't have been nicer, and didn't betray any annoyance that we were ordering so little.    

I loved that we were able to substitute salad, rice or broccoli at no extra charge, and we both went with salad.  It was a large portion, but simple - just romaine, tomato, cucumber and some seasoning, accompanied by a lemony vinaigrette.

The sandwiches were excellent, and we were given cups of extra tahini to put on them.  The pita had that extra bit of crispness around the edges that makes a sandwich great, and we both enjoyed our meals.

Khoury's is a large place, with cloth napkins and tablecloths covered with paper.  Only the lighting - too much, in my opinion - prevents me from thinking of this as an upscale place.  A little dimness would add megawatts to the atmosphere.

When one door closes, another opens.  In this case, you can take that literally."}
{"text":"I stopped in for an early dinner on the weekend. The dining area was spacious and clean with a touch of sophistication without losing its casual feel. The service was great throughout the meal and our server answered every question I had without hesitation.

I ordered the house Mezza which consisted of several small plates and fresh from the oven pita bread. Even though it's a little pricy ($35) I would recommend it to share, as it allows you to taste a wide selection of what they offer. It's very filling so don't be worried that it only has one hot item, falafels.

The baba ghanouch was rich, smokey, and not overly salted. The hummus as well was definitely a notch above your run of the mill grocery quality. A fresh basket of bread was brought upon request and I could watch it being taken directly from the oven, which makes all the difference. If you are more of a meat and rice fan, you can order it easily enough on their diverse menu but for the more adventurous I highly recommend the Mezza.

Lastly,  being curious, I ordered the Mediterranean coffee. This is a very strong, thick coffee brewed with cardamom in a traditional czeve. This is not for the faint of heart, but with a touch of sugar it was better than I expected. Very strong, a slight powdery feel but not bitter at all. This was my first experience with it and would order it again. How many cups of plain ol'joe have you had? Live a little and order this after your meal."}
{"text":"Khoury's is still the BEST Mediterranean food I have ever had. My sister used to live down the street, and what a find it is. Service is excellent and I do not mind a short wait for delicious food. There is nothing like their homemade pita bread!! I don't know what their fresh, homemade, green spicy paste is called but it is out of this world. 
I still tell all my friends to try it when they go to Vegas. My only wish is that it was closer to the strip."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and I usually only go when I'm in the area or a friend suggests. I'm always happy with the food, although it's not as good as their sister restaurant Hedary's. Their service is a bit slower as well. I do like the ambiance in this location, but it's a bit out of the way for me sometimes. 

The sandwiches are filling, but I'm not a fan of the pickle they sneak in there, so keep in mind if you're ordering as you might want to have that on the side. Just not sure it works with all the flavors. As always I stick with lamb schwarma or kabobs. I also often get a salad or hummus. The hummus is just ok, but it does the trick when you're having a craving.

Every time I've ever been here they haven't been extremely busy, but the service for refills tends to be a bit slow, so drink accordingly."}

We arrived for lunch and were seated quickly. The menu is extensive and almost everything in the menu was tempting me. It took a few minutes for my friend and I to decide what to order, but the waitress was patient.

I decided to order the lamb and filet kebab lunch plate. They are accommodating with gluten free and low carb requests which is great. I ended up asking for broccoli in place of rice and a side of baba ghanoush. 

Our meals came out quickly and everything was delicious. I haven't loved Khoury's in the past but this experience was much better and more impressive than my previous visits. 

Glad to have this new convenient location and I look forward to visiting again soon."}
{"text":"I love the babaganoush here. The kibbi is my favorite. Everything I've had here is awesome, and they also have a happy hour. Relaxed and chill little place, patio dining too. You can even catch a belly dancer on Friday and Saturday nights. They have a lil' hookah area if that tickles your fancy. If you do get food to go, check to make sure they've included everything. There's nothing like missing tahini sauce for your kibbi...makes me mad."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this great mediterranean restaurant. The pita bread that they bake fresh (yes, you can see the brick oven) is so good and it has a Yelp check in special. SCORE!  I've been here around ten times and no matter the business level the service has been friendly and on point.  The food is fantastic and I really loved their hummus.  I'll keep returning and returning."}
