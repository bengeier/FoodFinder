{"text":"This place is fantastic for Sonora style fried fish and shrimp tacos. The toppings bar is awesome for making your tacos the way you want, and the staff is very friendly. My only knock would be the ventilation isn't amazing and it is a smaller space, so it can get a little stuffy and you'll leave with a full belly but clothes that smell like fried fish."}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite on the way to PHX and tried this place out. Small menu, clean atmosphere, and nice options at salsa bar. Tried the much talked about machaca fish taco and a shrimp taco. They come out quick on a great corn tortilla and then it is up to you to build whatever you want on top from the salsa bar.   Overall, quite tasty. I like that they don't try to do too much or be too much. I would appreciate some avocado options...either guac or slices, but other than that, I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I felt like I was eating fish tacos on a beach in Mexico!   I drove by and the name caught my eye. An hour later after running errands I decided to eat here when I checked the yelp reviews. I couldn't leave here until I left a review."}
{"text":"I don't know if I'll ever go back to Rubio's; this place is the bomb! Love the condiments bar so you can make your taco exactly how you want it. Staff is super friendly, and prices are reasonable. Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Good fish tacos.  I had the regular and the full. Fish cooked perfectly. One of the things I really liked is that they have a salsa and fixing bar so you can put whatever you want on your tacos. Very friendly staff. The reason for only 4 stars is the fries weren't very crisp. Had they been crisper they would have been very good."}
{"text":"When in Rome... So I was thinkin, I'm in Arizona, why not be Arizonian..? Arizonite? Or is an Arizonite, one who hates Arizona? Anyways...  I drove 35 on the freeway, right next to a little ol' lady, even waved to her;  she waved back, I love old people.  Anyways... I talked golf. All the sport channels talked golf 80% of the time, so I talked golf. And I even went to a spring training game. I couldn't bear up and see the diamondbacks tho... They just suck. So I went with the opening of Hohokam park for the Oakland Athletics.  They played the gigantes. You might know them as the world champs. I wouldn't know, I ain't big on sports. Anyways... So, yeah. Out west, fish tacos are supposed to be the deal. The business. The foundation... It was al ' right. This fish taco spot. Alright, but nothing like the people in San Diego  know about. Not that I'd know about San Diego, or people, I've just heard rumors. Anyways... I've been here enough that I guess I'm an Arizonite."}
{"text":"Stopped in while at the Arizona grand resort for lunch. Lucked out and was taco Tuesday ! Basic menu literally fish and tortillas. Awesome battered fish that you create into spectacular specimens of goodness via the condiment bar. We had the fish, chicken, and our favorite the shrimp. I'll be back! Great service as well."}
{"text":"Have to say this is pretty excellent food. Very inexpensive, quick, and tasty. You won't find anything fancy here - but you get way more than you pay for. I had a battered chicken, a battered fish taco and a regular quesadilla. Made to order, fresh tortilla and what I think is chihuahua cheese. Chicken and fish were cooked perfectly and any extra toppings are self serve. Only thing I wish is that they hadn't mixed cilantro in with the onions-man I hate cilantro."}
{"text":"Delicious! The are very liberal with the amount of fish you get. The seasoning is perfectly understated and there isn't too much batter. They had tons of different topping options which were all fresh and delicious!! Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is off the chart. Staff is super friendly and the food is amazing... Next I will try the salad as they look amazing. Highly recommend..."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly sure when this chain hit the valley, but after eating there I was left wondering where it has been all my life. All their food, from the tortillas to everything on the salsa bar, is freshly made in house every day - and it is excellent. These guys really have perfected everything on their humble menu. The staff is uber friendly, too! Will be going back soon  :)"}
{"text":"Maybe 2.5  Please serve your tacos with with 2 tortillas  I had to eat my tacos with a fork"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place. Maybe it's because I'm a fat guy but the tacos are tiny for what you pay. Had the fish taco and while it was edible it was far from the best fish taco. Also had The Governor and it was bleh. I like cheese but the thing was put together so sloppily that i had to eat it with a knife and fork. Which I've never had to do in my 33 years of eating quesadilas and it kinda defeats the purpose of it being a finger food. I live at McClintock & Southern and would not make the drive a second time. The best thing about this place was the extra hot hot sauce."}
{"text":"Good portions, freshly made, and friendly people.  What more could you ask and taste great.  The salsa bar was outstanding."}
{"text":"My wife and I just left Tortilla Fish and we were both impressed. We each had 2 tacos, fries and drinks. The food was very good and tasty. The salsa bar was well stocked with fresh items. The staff was pleasant and helpful and ready to please. Noticed on the menu they have fish and fries, which we will try on our next trip."}
{"text":"Best place for fish tacos in the area. Authentic and made fresh right before you.  The place is nice and clean, staff is courteous. Five stars all the way."}
{"text":"Unique flavors made these the best fish tacos I've had. Price of a meal is competes well with fast food joints but the quality and taste is way better.  Busy little joint but only takes about 2 min after ordering."}
{"text":"Rating: 4.5/5  I've been here a few times, and the shrimp tacos are amazing. Honestly, they are probably the best I have ever had. The owner is very nice, the food is fresh and delicious, and I love the sauces they have at the salsa bar. My only complaint is the price, they're $3.49 per shrimp taco. Although I love the tacos, I do feel they are slightly overpriced. I usually leave wanting to eat another taco or two, but I just can't get myself to fork over $7 for two more tacos. If the shrimp tacos were $2.99 I would say this place has earned a complete 5 stars without a doubt. I still chose to round up to 5 stars on the rating just because the food is so good."}
{"text":"Family owned and delicious food... What more could you ask for? I tried this place after seeing it a few times and walking past to Panda Express... So glad I decided to stop. I had a battered fish taco and a shrimp taco with some of their homemade salsas...  Fish was good, fries were good, plenty of food for my dollar, and a warm smile on the girl taking my order. I have absolutely no complaints, will definitely visit again and would most definitely recommend. My only regret is I didn't catch the cashier's name to compliment her."}
{"text":"This place is DISGUSTING.  Tacos lack flavor and their specialty cabbage is beyond gross -tastes as if something poisonous was sprayed on it.  It's said food tastes delicious if you're starving.  Well, it didn't in my case.  I wouldn't give it any stars if it were an option."}
{"text":"Definitely the best place for real authentic fish tacos.. I know this because i grew up in Ensenada and Tijuana MX. Variety is simple Fish and Shrimp but they do a great job mixing it up quesadilla or combo also they have a Barbacoa taco (slow cook tender beef) really recommended. My new favorite place to eat.."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelpers for the suggestion, in town for a few days and looking for a place to get my Taco fix, this place really hit the spot, and the sauce bar was stocked well and the selection of hot sauces was great!"}
{"text":"The fish machaca taco was great with all the toppings they have available. They have house sauces including ranch which are fantastic. Great service and a very clean, simple atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you are looking for excellent fish or chicken tacos, this is the place to go. Lots of different sauces and toppings to choose from. Employees are very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"I looooove fish tacos. This place really is affordable, and they don't skimp on the fish. I got two loaded with fried fish and then you can add whatever toppings you want at the salsa bar. My favorite was the cabbage and avocado sauce. I was super full and couldn't finish all of it. The fish was flakey and the breading was perfect.   Also, the fries are delicious. My kids got a cheese quesadilla and that was perfect size and also delicious. Mozzarella on a corn tortilla instead of flour. A great twist on a classic."}
{"text":"don't judge a book by it's cover. this place has great food. go with the steamed fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and very clean. But it took a bit to get my food. So don't expect fast when you eat here. The food is tasty. I had two chicken tacos and a fish because it was taco Tuesday and you got a free taco. Unfortunately the fried nuggets they put into tortillas make eating a little difficult. And  the tacos are presented naked with just meat nuggets and tortillas. There is a bar with sides. Various sauces and salsas but no dairy what so ever so if you like cheese and sour cream this is t your place."}
{"text":"We went here for Taco Tuesday & got 3 kinds of fish tacos. Liked the UNbreaded/grilled fish the best. Liked being able to add all the cilantro & onions we wanted from the salsa bar. We loved this place until we went to Taquitos Jalisco on Broadway, which is hands down better authentic food. But we'd eat at Tortilla Fish again for sure."}
{"text":"So So good fish and shrimp tacos!! It was my first time in Arizona and we look up on yelp for a quick lunch not far from Phoenix airport and Boom! got the best tasty lunch ever!  The place was clean and the staff were nice. I like how they have all kinds of sauces at a sauce bar you can get all you want! Yum.. I hope they expand the restaurant over the US really."}
{"text":"This place is pretty tasty. And the food is served fast!   The place is quite small. We were a large group and we had to split up over several tables.   The tacos were very good. I was pretty satisfied with them. However, the fries were definitely over-fried. After a few, I felt one of my arteries would clog from all the grease they were oozing. I love fries, and I know they're not healthy, but these were definitely too much.   They had a good selection of sauces and toppings to put on the tacos, and several saucers of each on a little salad bar thing, so there wasn't much of a hold-up with that.   Overall, the place is pretty okay, and if I'm close by and craving fish tacos, I'll definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Love It! This is the only place where you can get authentic Sonoran shrimp and fish tacos. It's always a risk getting seafood in Arizona but it's super fresh and delicious at Tortilla Fish."}
{"text":"Went here because I got an Amazon Local deal, and now I am glad that I did! The place was empty when I got there, which worried me a little, but the service was fast and friendly, and the food was delicious. Between my husband and myself we had the machaca fish, shrimp and battered fish tacos, and they were all really tasty. The corn tortilla had just enough elasticity to hold together without tearing, but was not chewy. The battered shrimp and fish had good flavor and did not taste like the fish sticks you get at the grocery store, like in some places. Two tacos was enough to fill me up, and they leave the topping choice up to you (there is a little fixings-type bar with slaw, salsas, etc). Worth the trip to check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a must-go-to type of place! I got the shrimp tacos and they were delicious! My friends had the fish tacos and they said that the fish was very fresh and flavorful. The toppings bar is a nice addition and the tartar sauce and coleslaw is my personal favorite. The owner was very nice and I would definitely go here again! It is a nice addition to the neighborhood. If you are taking guests from out of town like I was, this is a very nice place for them to experience some \"southwestern\" cuisine. If you go here you will not be upset! Everything was very clean and the food was delicious, too."}
{"text":"Not what I expected, seemed more fast food than fast casual, limited menu, food didn't seem very fresh. Salsa bar was hard to find items and what was offered. Fish tacos were on the greasy side with too much breading, but the actual fish was very good."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and it was a home run!  You'd drive right by this little restaurant and never think twice but it's worth a stop. The menu is simple and the quality of food was outstanding.  I ordered a fish taco, shrimp taco and \"Machaca Fish\" taco. Each taco was delicious and made even better by the add-ons at the Salsa Bar. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick, fresh delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"Incredible! Salsa bar is where a lot of the magic happens. I also really enjoy the rock en español they play."}
{"text":"OK I go to many places for Fish Tacos, but this over the counter place is just fantastic. First the fish is so lightly battered and tender it literally melts in your mouth. The chunky tartar sauce is tangy and rich with flavor and if your like me I add some Hot Salsa to the mix and BAM what flavor.  I'm a big guy and 2 tacos fills me up, just fine, so for a quick lunch or like I experience the Fish Taco must have now feeling, this is my place to go."}
{"text":"So I created a Yelp account just to write this review, let's give this awesome spot some business!  You have to check out Tortilla Fish!  I met my boyfriend for lunch during his work break, and we will definitely be coming back here again and again!  I had a fish taco.  I love their salsa bar!  I think its great fun to dress your own taco : ). I topped mine with their sweet cabbage slaw, avocado sauce, cilantro dressing, onion salsa, pico de gayo, lime, and hot sauce.  I piled those salsas on and ate it with a fork like a salad... Too delicious!!   I am looking forward to sampling their other menu offerings, but am already craving again what I had today.  What an awesome deal for $2.99!  The interior is lovely and clean with a really nice feel.  The walls are blue with nice modern tiling and photographs on the wall, they have tv menu screens.  The people working their today (I think perhaps be owner was there as well) were very positive and attentive and the food was ready speedy fast.  This will definitely be replacing our trips to Rubio's as the food is much tastier and you get more for your money.  Can't wait for my next lunch there!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this out and were quite impressed. I had shrimp, chicken and fish tacos. The batter used is delicious and they have quite a bit of meat on them. The chicken was super tender and the fish was perfectly cooked. All three were fried. My girlfriend really enjoyed her chicken taco and quesadilla.   The restaurant was clean and we did not wait long. The toppings bar has everything you'd need for a taco. The vegetables are fresh and the sauces and salsas are delicious. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"These may be the best battered fish tacos I've had. They come fresh and hot - delicious. The Full taco, with battered fish, shrimp, and cheese-stuffed peppers. The salsa bar has lots of good fixings. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in town. Give them a try. There Pico is great. Good service.. you won't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Their fish and shrimp tacos are delicious. This place beats the pants off of Rubios or any other fish tacos I have ever had at a restaurant. They do one thing and they do it right!"}
{"text":"5 stars because of few reasons; tacos were tasty, the salsa bar looked crazy fresh, & I left welcome from the moment I walked in the door! I was greeted as I walked in, they asked if I've been here before (i haven't), gave me recommendations, they also took the time to tell me what everything was on the salsa bar! Great customer service makes for a great experience! Thank you & if I wasn't only visiting AZ I would come here often!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Sonoran food! Carne Asada and the fish tacos were both excellent. The Caramelo is a naughty little thing. I would have posted a photo of the bomb food, but it's gone! Must try."}
{"text":"best fish/shrimp tacos north of the border. amazing salsa bar and even their fries are good. if only they sold beer...."}
{"text":"I love mexican cuisine! and this place seemed to hit the mark for me! Very fresh and flavorful, also great prices. Easy joint to stop in and eat healthy quick! Im a big fan so far! Went with a pretty large group and there was a decent amount of seating. Gets kinda busy around the lunch rush hour but, like I said quick service so no need to worry! Yum"}
{"text":"Awesome small clean establishment, fresh food and prompt service. Good portion size, I ordered 4 tacos which is probably more than I can finish. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"The food was just ok, I like how clean the place is though. Staff was nice enough, they seemed annoyed we were in there right before they closed which I totally understand but it was only 30 min til close and we only ordered a small amount of food.   We came in late and ordered a few tacos.   I'm not disappointed nor am I impressed.  I didn't feel that this place was very authentic which is something I hope for in regards to tacos. We just felt that is was only an ok place to eat.   The one thing that bothered me was that they deep fried our corn chips immediately after the fish. So our chips tasted like fish, which isn't my fave it actually kindof grosses me out. They also threw them into a styrofoam container piping hot. So our chips melted into the plastic which I must say can't be too good to eat. Most places put them in a paper bag?  So I threw them away. Which was a waste of chips and money.  The fact that they deep fry all the protein for the tacos is kindof lame. I feel like I would have rather had regular tacos without the deep fry. We didn't know otherwise we would have prolly gone somewhere else. My husband is actually allergic to dairy and told them that and said no cheese. That would have been a good time for them to say oh by the way we use buttermilk in our batter or whatever  They failed to mention that their breading had dairy in it...... That would have been useful information because he has been sick since we ate the tacos.    Beans were not good, rice was not good. Both dry. But edible. Salsa bar was ok, decent selection but it looked like it had all been sitting out all day.  The pico was all dried out looking. I found it odd that they had some soggy cucumbers with no dressing at the bar as an option but no actual mild red salsa.   I would rather go to an actual taco truck next time.  It sucks cause this place is literally right by our house so wish we had a better experience.   I wouldn't necessarily recommend.  We most likely will not return.   I'll go to Taco Bell before I come here again.   Dear tortilla fish, please stop deep frying your chips in the same fryer as the fish. It's gross. Also get some paper bags to put the chips in so everyone has less of a chance of getting cancer.   Thanks."}
{"text":"First time here. Craving fish n shrimp tacos. The food was fresh and cooked when we ordered. Lightly battered and fried fish n shrimp in corn tortillas. The come out naked and you dress them at the salsa bar. Very good but would like more topping options. Service very good bathrooms clean we ould definitely make a return visit. Its added to our rotation."}
{"text":"Umm, this place is amazing. I'm so glad Yelp Ads exist otherwise I would not have found this place. I really only Yelp the places I'm crazy about and this is my new favorite taco shop. I had the shrimp and fish tacos and the shrimp were my favorite, both very good. Ordered fries too because I read some reviews and they did not disappoint.   Staff was super friendly and welcoming. Food was quick."}
{"text":"This is as perfect as fast food gets!  The Full Taco includes a cheese filled pepper, the fish is nice and crispy."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! I'm an avid taco consumer and honestly the only way I could have a better taco is if I made it myself. My boyfriend and I went on Tuesday and did the taco Tuesday deal where you get a free taco with the purchase of two tacos. We would definitely recommend this place to any other taco lovers."}
{"text":"I was waiting for the opening of this place! This is their second location and I am happy it is so close to home. This is the first time I've tried Tortilla Fish and now I am hooked   Our order included battered fish tacos, a Barbacoa beef taco, shrimp quesadilla, steak quesadilla, rice and beans. Everything comes undressed so you can wild out at the salsa bar. Everything you could ever want on your taco or quesadilla! The fish by itself is melt in your mouth. The shrimp tastes fresh and not like salad shrimps. The Barbacoa is tender and juicy like a pot roast.  Only thing is the tables are tight if the place is busy which it was and I assume it will always be. They do have patio seating so that's a plus!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Exceptionally clean..Friendly and helpful staff and fresh tasty food. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The other five stars reviews say enough.  For a taco joint this is one of the best I've been in.  The wait wasn't overly long.  The staff is preparing the food right before your eyes if you care to pay attention.  It's not a big bin of precooked ingredients kept warm under heat lamps or whatever.  2nd reason for the 10 minute wait for my food was, during this lunchtime hour, the place was about full of obviously satisfied diners.  This place is busy b/c the grub is good.  The hand prepared sauces are top notch too.  If in the area w/ any appetite in the future I'm headed back for sure."}
{"text":"Este lugar esta perra! Probé los tacos de camaron, ingasu asta los dedos me chupe. El señor creo que era el dueño bien A todo dar el vale! Y los ingredientes a su propio gusto. Lo recomiendo si andan crudos lol   Provecho plebada!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Wonderful, friendly and courteous service. Great food, great prices and a fantastic little salsa bar. Seriously, all of the sauces and sauces are to die for. Highly recommended for any lunch or takeout dinner.  Me and the wife had a selection of a lot of what they offer and everything's been fantastic. Crispy juicy fish and amazing shrimp.  *Edit: also the place is spotless ^_^"}
{"text":"The taco Tuesday deal is pretty good. Two tacos get one free. My boyfriend and I have gone twice so far. We have tried every taco they have to order and they're all delicious..my favorite is the full taco. My boyfriend's favorite is the Carne asada. the only complaint I have is that each time we've gone there was always one taco that was cold. And I mean ice cold. But other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim for a quick lunch and WOW I am so glad I did!  The manager was so friendly and helpful.  He asked if it was my first time, welcomed me, and made menu recommendations.  The food arrived quickly, and the manager made suggestions for how to dress the fish machaca tacos at their incredible condiment bar.  I followed his recommendations to the letter and the results were INCREDIBLE.  The food quality reminded me of something much higher end, yet my entire bill was less than $10!  Service 5 stars, Food 5 stars, Value 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch and had one of the best meals I can remember! Do not be fooled by the casual atmosphere, hidden location and limited menu - the food is GREAT!"}
{"text":"Pretty Delish!  Both the chicken and the shrimp tacos are equally good and the fries are good.  The salsa bar is pretty awesome.  If they get flour tacos, I would give them 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Not from this part of town. A local recommended this newly opened place. I was very impressed with the fish taco...generous serving of lightly battered fish - topping bar had many options. I got to dress it My Way!!  They have Taco Tuesday buy two get one Free!!"}
{"text":"So had a day date with the hubby yesterday here and had to come back today,brought my nephew along this time, he wanted to try the chicken and fish tacos. We got the carne asada yesterday. The food was just as good today as yesterday. The staff was great, informative and friendly and the shop was clean. I'll deffanitly be back a 3rd 4th or many more times."}
{"text":"Like Tortilla Fish.  Very simple menu,  fish tacos (steamed or fried), shrimp tacos (fried only), a few salads and quesadillas, that's all.  No rice or beans. But good quality, friendly service, and quick turnaround.  Nice salsa bar which has different topping for your tacos,  that includes a coleslaw like topping, a few different types of salsa, jalapenos and a chipotle mayo and avocado topping,  plus a few other ones.  Had one taco that had shredded steamed fish that was much better than I expected (not fishy, and the perfect amount of spices,  and another one that had fried fish, fried shrimp and and fried pepper stuffed with cheese.  Ingredients of good quality and freshness that I really enjoyed.  Sometimes I don't feel well after eating fried foods, but this one wasn't too greasy,  and felt just fine afterwords.     I did try the fried fish and french fries,  which was too doughy and not enough fish, just the smaller pieces that you'd get in the tacos.   That I would not recommend.  Dining area and restrooms were very neat, and clean, and people there are also super friendly.  Good value.."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this local restaurant with a simple and focused menu.  However, the food just didn't seem to be fresh and prepared in house.  The fish tacos tasted too much like canned tuna fish."}
{"text":"This is my favorite little restaurant in the East Valley!  Really tasty and unique food, great prices, nice people, and really convenient to order ahead online (through Yelp)."}
{"text":"Decent fried fish, great fries, and the chipotle sauce is excellent. Compared to quality fish and chips in a coastal area, it falls short but is saved by good condiments."}
{"text":"Overrated.. Just ok nothing special. Have had better fish tacos other places . Not many items in salsa bar on my visit.  Just ok."}
{"text":"I think what I ordered today was just a bad choice for trying this place out for the first time...next time I'm sticking to the chicken..I ordered the fish machan tacos ala cart. P for pass...I should have done the shrimp."}
{"text":"Tacos are a little small BUT very tasty. Look for their coupons on valpak. Awesome salsa and sauce bar!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for fish tacos this is the place to go. Much better than the sit down Mexican restaurants in the area and a very reasonable price. The portions are quite large and you have lots of options with the toppings bar. It was so good we ordered more before leaving."}
{"text":"Being from the Bay Area and first time in AZ, yelp again never fails us! Tortilla Fish is quality food and their sides & toppings are off the hook! The self serve salsa bar is what makes your fish tacos, incredible! We came on a monday right before noon I believe? We made it just in time before the crowd! Pretty sure the wait would have been really long. Next time I come to AZ again, I will def stop by this spot! Thank you Tortilla Fish!"}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos were bomb! Sadly there were out of barbacoa. Man working told me i couldnt handle their hot sauce, but frankly i wish it was hotter. Still.. We will totally be back for more!!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good!!! The fries are ridiculously good for a taco shop. The fish tacos were pretty tasty. I thought the actual pieces of fried fish lacked flavor, however the sauce bar made up for that. Their sauce bar is their best feature. Lots of condiment option to spice up the tacos."}
{"text":"Amazing service, they were so kind, made us feel right at home. The food was incredible as well, so delicious and decently priced! We will definitely be eating here on a regular basis! Thank you for the great food, and amazing service. It's much appreciated."}
{"text":"Some of the Best tacos we've had by far and going back later on this week! Highly recommend the food! Service was fantastic and friendly and cost was low!"}
{"text":"Two stars might be a little low, but considering how many great taco shops inhabit this general neighborhood, was the best I could offer.   Everything was \"meh\", not bad. The tortillas were adequate, the fish fresh but flavorless. The toppings are ok, but even there the pickled veggies were uninspiring.   The toppings bar itself isn't a terrible idea, but it loses the thoughtful preparation of a good chef who knows flavors.   There are better places to go for fish tacos nearby."}
{"text":"Having a house in Ensenada Mexico we would always look forward to the fish tacos there. This place hands down has the best fish tacos for AZ. Fresh fish and shrimp. Salsa and condiment bar was nice and clean. I stopped in on Tuesday for buy two get one taco free deal. I got the fish,shrimp and the \"governador\" a quesadilla with shrimp and fish. I paid a little extra for the governador but worth it. Each taco has plenty,they aren't stingy here. Nice owners too.  You won't be disappointed. We will frequent more often.  buenos los tacos. Gracias."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD!  I've been looking for a great fish taco and this is my go to spot.  Buy 2 get 1 free on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I love Mexican and seafood, so this place is right up my alley. They make everything fresh. The salsa bar lets you customize your order.  I had the 3 for 2 Tuesday special. The shrimp taco was the best, followed by the fish machaca, then the Campechana. The menu is small, but that's because they focus on one area and do it very well.  Service was very friendly. The room is small without being cramped. The restaurant is clean and not heavily decorated.  I will be back, and I am telling my friends to check it out."}
{"text":"The staff are extremely helpful (at least one seemed to still be learning the menu), knowledgeable, friendly, and maybe even excited about their new biz!  LOVE that!  The menu is extremely shrimp heavy, which isn't great since I'm allergic. I did learn that they COMPLETELY separately cook the shrimp from the fish (including labels on everything - so I knew they weren't just saying that and it probably would be safe for me to eat).  I wasn't too hungry though, so I just got the simple cheese quesadilla for $2.99.  It's pretty paltry to look at, but once you add your choice of toppings from the condiment bar, it's worth more than that, for sure.    The had an onion mix, cole slaw, fresh cabbage, pico, several salsas, several sauces, and a great selection of hot sauces to choose from.  Drinks include free refills (but drink station is in the kitchen so it's not self serve--not my favorite).  I hope this place succeeds. It's in a strip mall by Walmart (gag), and next to Subway and Panda Express (gag)."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since the restaurant opened with its odd previous name... best known for their fish and shrimp tacos, I've been a fan since day one. I think enough has been said about these fish tacos and the numerous options on the salsa bar.  The one thing I will add is this - the carne asada here is some of the best in the valley. I had it for the first time the other day, and it has become my favorite. There's a very popular Mexican restaurant down the street that is well known for its carne asada - this is even better, and its time the word got out."}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to this place and I have to say that their food and service are exceptional - consistently. Consistency is what captures my attention. Everyone has good and bad days, but it's the consistently \"good\" businesses that receive my praise.  I was in the mood for some sea food, but couldn't decide how to satisfy the cravings. Suddenly it dawned on me - fish tacos! I remembered seeing a promotion from these guys (Tuesdays - buy any two items, get one free). Shortly after I think I blacked out for a bit :) because next thing I know I'm pulling away from the store with three tacos to go. :)  My advise, though, is to eat inside. If you have the time, their salsa bar is fantastic. The choices work well together and individually and the beauty of it all - you can customize it to your liking.  I definitely recommend this place and when you go, don't forget to check yelp for \"check-in\" promotions. I also got a free large drink because I used my app to check in.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy and delicious.  Clean interior, great service. I had a fish and a shrimp taco. You can get fried or steamed both were excellent. They have all the fixings you could ever want on the side bar.  No drive through needed. You will be in and out in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"This place has excellent fried fish tecos. Although I wish it had seasoned grilled fish options, the  fried fish was absolutely delicious. The portions were generous and the fish tacos were very reasonably priced. You have to doctor them up with all the special sauces and toppings they have at their salsa bar which is part of the fun.  You get them exactly how you want them."}
{"text":"First time here and what looked to have a lot of potential was instead very disappointing.   1. They did not have any carne asada available. 2. The ice tea tasted like it hadn't been changed in weeks.  3. The chicken was soggy and gross. Battered/fried chicken should not be soft and mushy. Gross. I couldn't even eat it.  4. The establishment was not very clean.   With that said, I do still think this place has potential, but at the very least there needs to be a change in management. Either way, I probably won't ever be able to go back after the way I am feeling right now."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times within last year, and I've been surprised by the lack of a crowd. I think their food a service warrants more customers.   The value is good here especially with the salsa bar they have. I always end up ordering too much thinking it's too cheap and load up on the salsa bar, and end up with too much food.  I wish I lived closer to here, I only visited here for IKEA. Definitely worth the price and drive!"}
{"text":"For my taste, good not great food.  A hole in the wall in a strip center. Clean,simple place with nice people."}
{"text":"Best fish and shrimp tacos I have EVER had.  It is served with just a very light breading and you get a lot of fish or shrimp for the price.  They give you the tortilla and fish, then you add the rest.  The coleslaw is awesome with all of the different sauces.  I got all my family hooked on these and we are usually in once a week.  When I have out of town guests, this will be one of our stops.  Thanks to Tortilla Fish for the best tacos ever....."}
{"text":"From 3-6pm they have 2$ fish tacos, they come bare but have a condiment bar with everything you need. French fries were perfect and the fish was great!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. Wasn't over the top, but passable. The place is nice and the staff is friendly, but passable food. Maybe I just hit a bad night and will give this place one more chance."}
{"text":"The food here is everything they say it is, but the small place is not very easy to find, even with a GPS! It's to the right of Panda Express right next door to the Burger King on West Elliot, if that helps. You should enjoy this place while it's still swinging for the fences and being run by the friendly man who started it, because it will surely be a multi-location chain in the near future! Unbelievably inexpensive for the high quality product!"}
{"text":"Battered Fish is very tasty! Fries are delicious. They offer a variety of salsas and toppings. Only thing I will complain about is that I wish I had some chips to eat with my beans and rice.  Other than that I wish we had one of these in Texas!"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed as all I could really taste was the breading on both the fish and shrimp tacos. They have a bar where they have tartar and other sauces as well as salsas. Well, the salsas were mediocre at best. Really surprised by all the great reviews."}
{"text":"First, let me apologize for taking so long to review this place. Next, let me say this, Sweet Baby Jesus this place is the TRUTH! Great Scott we have a gem with this spot! By far the best, and I mean the BEST, fish and shrimp tacos I've ever had! An I should know, I'm a beaner! It's in our blood! We invented tacos! The fact that you can do fish alone or shrimp alone is reason enough to try this place, BUUUT... throw in the fact that you can have both in one taco with a cheese filled chile!? Oooooh child errybody  got time fo dat! This place has been my vice ever since I've found this place. I'm always having people go there to try their wholesome goodness. These aren't the skimpy small tacos you'd expect at a taqueria, no sir, these are the real deal tortilla, not no carb friendly serving chingadera. Bask in the glory of a full taco, which subsequently is one of the taco's name on the menu. Although I have stopped going in to order food myself, I always send my lowly sevants, or lot attendants as they are called, to pick me up some deliciousness on taco tuesday. Why? Because it's buy 2 get 1 free! That's 3 tacos! Plaster on some slaw, some cilantro sauce, avacado sauce, a and the pièce de rèsistance: Chipotle sauce... you've got yourself a masterpiece of a taco. 5 stars for this heavenly eatery spot!"}
{"text":"Great dive, that isn't really a dive. Strip mall setting that is clean and inviting. Limited menu, but with everything done perfectly. The kids had quesadillas, I had a fish taco (great!!) & a full taco. Mom and my wife had fish machaca tacos, which were good, but a little wet/messy. We also shared a shrimp salad all five of us ate for $26."}
{"text":"personal amable y servicial y preparan rapido.  Buenos precios y buen sabor"}
{"text":"Wow!  Loved this place. Had fish taco and a shrimp taco. It was delicious! Large portions. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"When I can't go eat fish tacos in Mexico, I come here. Great fish tacos!! My favorite is the full taco. The fries are great too!"}
{"text":"So excited that this place finally opened. It has been saying coming soon for quite some time now. Then I noticed the doors where finally open so over for lunch I came. My coworker who was with me chickened out and went next door to the corporate Chinese place. I am glad I decided to come here. It was really good. The menu is pretty simple. Not that much on it and the prices are fairly reasonable. They have fish tacos, of course, and shrimp tacos. I decided to go with the Full Taco per the recommendation of the cashier. The Full Taco has fish and shrimp on a corn tortilla with a stuffed yellow pepper. The cheese in the pepper proceeds to melt all over the inside of the taco and makes it that much better. Before you take you food to go or sit down to eat make sure you hit up the toppings bar. With all kinds of salsa and other goodies to jazz up your taco a little. I also got fries and a drink. I did get two tacos which with the fries turned out to be more than enough. The total was $11 but with just one taco, fries and a drink I think it would be more in line with any other fast food place. The fries are really good. They fry them in the batter and wow. It makes them so much better than your regular fries. The restaurant is very clean and modern with TV screens of menu boards. The minor complaint is that the soda fountain is behind the counter. So they have to serve you your soda which slows things down just a little. But it is just a minor thing and not a big deal at all. Since this place is so close to work and so good I will definitely be back. Probably regularly."}
{"text":"Tried tortilla fish because my husband couldn't stop talki g about how good it was since he came in earlier in the week on his lunch time. The place is extremely clean does not smell considering they serve fish. We tried the fish, carne and shrimp tacos they were all so good. Their salad bar is awesome so many sauces and vegetables to choose from. The prices are reasonable as well. Plus the server was very nice and was fast. I would definitely return"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while looking for a place to get lunch and I wasn't sure what to expect.  Food was yummy and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I had found fish taco shan gri la! I passed by this place a few times, since moving to a new office, but I'm always skeptical about corporate sounding places trying to look like local food joints. This place wows and is definitely a good local find. I went with the fried fish taco ($2.99), the mixed fish and shrimp taco ($3.50) and a shrimp quesadilla. The fish was SUPER fresh and light. They serve the tacos bare, and have all the fixins you could want to pimp out your taco. They had 4 different salsas ranging from mild to super duper hot, quite a few sauces like chipotle, avocado and cilantro, plus onions, cilantro, lime and just about anything you want. All in al a great meal if you're in the mood for fish and shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"This will be short and to the point. This place has the best fish tacos in all of AZ period!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm, Did someone say Fish Tacos? I must admit I've been waiting for this place to open ever since I saw the \"coming soon\" banner. A Fish Taco shop is exactly what this area needed especially since the Baja Fresh down the street closed a couple of months ago.  The Fish Tacos are legit! They freshly fry them up when you order them so they are never cold. They have an extensive salsa/topping bar to make your fantasy fish taco just the way you want it. The place is always clean and the service is friendly. The menu is limited, (which I like) because to me that shows they take pride in they do. I highly recommend the standard Fish Taco for starters and the Full Taco which has  fish, shrimp and a cheese-filled yellow hot pepper  (but beware this one requires a fork once you pile on the toppings!). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how you can not love this place. It is fantastic! They make all the tacos to order so they are hot and delicious. They come \"plain\", but that is so you can build your perfect taco from the toppings bar. The toppings are always fresh and crispy and the salsa is actually spicy! The staff seem to work at both locations and they are very pleasant and helpful.  This location even has carne asada tacos which are pretty good, but I like the fish ones way too much.  So to sum up ignore the low reviews and go try it for yourself. Just make sure to add lots of toppings."}
{"text":"Delicious Authentic Mexican Tacos!! My favorite is the Full Taco. Clean place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Can't beat $1.99 fish tacos during daily happy hour!  Great selection, and I love that you get your tortilla and fish plain and add on toppings yourself- you get to craft your perfect taco every time. I only wish they had non-fried options!"}
{"text":"What a tasty experience!!!  Went on Taco Tuesday and ordered the Full, a Fish and the Mixed tacos.  Got one free!!  It was delicious!!! They serve it to you without toppings but they have a nice toppings bar where you can choose your own.  The fish was lightly battered as was the shrimp (loved the shrimp) I also loved their house made tartar sauce with the pico as did my hubby.  Will definitely be going back soon.  Definitely a must try guys!!!"}
{"text":"My Salad was fresh and crisp, batter was tasty and cooked well in the fish taco. I could have just used a little kicker too the full taco. Not really exiting but good food."}
{"text":"I like the food in this place. However, the service is very slow and they are a bit disorganized and possibly short staffed as well.  Definitely could improve on the service but the food is good and tasty.   They also have taco Tuesdays where you buy two tacos and get one free.  Good smorgasbord of stuff to make your burritos and tacos any way you want.  They also close at 8 pm which is a bit of a bummer."}
{"text":"Since seeing Monica O. frequent this place, I had to try it. The tacos are made to order so they are served hot and delicious. They do come \"plain\", but that is so you can build your perfect taco from the toppings bar. The toppings are always fresh and crispy and the salsa is actually spicy! The staff seem to work at both locations and they are very pleasant and helpful.   I have never had a bad lunch here. Although I usually go early as they get packed closer to normal lunch time with limited seating, but it's worth the wait or getting it to go.  The food is simple and fantastic keep up the good work."}
{"text":"A little far for us normally, but on our way to Ikea and found this place nearby. Decided we were in the mood for some fish tacos. Wow! So glad we did.   This place is pretty unassuming. Located in a strip mall across from Wal-Mart. It's small inside, but very clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. They told us the special for the day and pointed out the salsa bar. You order at the counter and are given a number while they prepare it.  The menu is basic featuring fish tacos, quesadillas and fries. Everything is made to order. Tortillas made fresh daily! And, the salsa bar is amazing!! Fries are battered and go well with tacos! Who knew?!  Best fish tacos ever!!"}
{"text":"Sitting on the couch I had a craving for fish tacos but being in Arizona this can prove harder to satisfy than normal. The tacos and fries here are legit. I made the mistake of ordering these to go and the crispyness of the fish steamed away a bit but the flavors were still there.   The salsa bar was a wonderland of flavors and colors. Try the green sauce in the bottles. You will not be disappointed. My only real issue was the cabbage is chopped up fine instead of shredded which is a staple of traditional fish tacos. That being said the fish makes up for it. Staff was super helpful and service was really quick. Get in there for some tasty tacos!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have great quality fish and probably the best fish tacos I've had in town. Everything is always fresh, especially the toppings they have in their salsa bar. I love the breading they have on their fish. The full taco is the best, and they are huge!! Two full tacos will really fill you up. The place is always clean and the staff is friendly. The prices are amazing as well for fresh and quality fish."}
{"text":"I came on taco Tuesday ordered 2 tacos and got the 3rd one free. The tacos are so well served that I could only eat 2 tacos. The 3rd will have to wait for dinner.  I ordered one full one campechana and one barbacoa. The barbacoa was good but not the best I've had. The full is fish and shrimp it was very good. The fish was very tender melt in ur mouth. I loved it."}
{"text":"Barbacoa tacos were on point. Fries are great and you get to add your own topping. Recommend this place for a quick stop and good food."}
{"text":"Husband really liked it and would give it a solid four.  I thought it was good and would give it a solid 3+ so I rounded up.  Very small dining area but there is also patio seating.  Very  nice people working there.  Simple menu and you can put your own toppings on the tacos.  Toppings were pretty delicious.  What lacked a little was the meat - the shrimp taco and fish taco both came out fried.  I guess I read the menu too quickly and didn't notice ... which is fine but the fried food tasted like it has been frying in oil that should've been switched out a while ago.  If most of your food is fried, I think the oil should be changed out frequently.  With that said though, the fish and the shrimp taco both tasted good and nothing tasted \"fishy\" so we were good to go.  Finally, they are very generous with their cheese on the cheese quesadilla.    We would definitely come back and try again."}
{"text":"This place is really cute and clean. The menus on the flat screens are nice.  The food was ok. Our fish taco shells fell apart, and our fried fish wasn't that crunchy. The shrimp quesadilla was made with corn tortillas not flour, which is different , but not great. I hope they take these comments and make changes I would love to come back and try them again."}
{"text":"Awesome fish tacos!!! We dropped in for a snack in between meals and opted for the combo. 2 tacos of your choice a side of fries and a drink for 8.99. We got 2 full fish tacos which was both fish and shrimp. They bread and fry the seafood which is just the way I like it. They give you tacos plain (just tortilla, pepper, cheese and fish-they don't skimp) but their salsa bar is where it's at. Here you customize your taco. They have an array of salsas, sauces, veggies, and even coleslaw to top your tacos with. I LOVE THIS!  The coleslaw was crisp and fresh, pico was on point, no mushy over processed salsas here!  They also had squeeze bottles of mayo, chipotle dressing, cilantro dressing, ranch and of course hot sauces. All were awesome.  I almost got full off 1 taco! Now their fries, you don't expect much but these were some of the crispiest fries I've ever had! The tacos were very reminiscent of some we've had in Baja Mexico and I'm so glad we found some here.   Service was on point. Ruben the co owner was very friendly and while we ate our tacos he was very attentive to other patrons and even took the time to explain the salsa bar to a gentlemen. They seem very into making their customers happy and comfortable.   He let us know that Tuesday they offer a buy 2 get 1 free taco special and that if you like their Facebook they offer additional deals.   We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing food! Try it, you won't regret it. Campechana (mixed) taco!"}
{"text":"Tried 4 different kinds of tacos.  Loved the regular fried fish tacos and Barbacoa  the best.  Fries were good as well as the quesadillas.  And they have flavored tea and horchata. What a delicious meal for the whole family!"}
{"text":"We loved Tortilla fish!! I been there twice.  The service is excellent and fast. The place look very clean all the time. The food is amazing I tried the fish machaca taco, and my husband had the fish and shrimp. We both loved them all. The topping are fresh and different from other fish taco places. I also had the shrimp garden salad and is made with very fresh ingredients. Go and try this awesome pace!!!"}
{"text":"Went for taco Tuesday. Buy 2 get one free. I tried the Barbacoa, full, and macacha. The macacha was my favorite. It's a little spicy but has great flavor. The babacoa is really good as well. I did not like the battered fish as well in the full, it was a little too salty. They have a great selection on toppings to compliment your tacos as well. I would go back but would wouldn't get the battered fish again."}
{"text":"If I'm in the mood to get fish tacos for a reasonable price, the first place I think of is Tortilla Fish! Buy two get one free is their offer here on taco Tuesday but honestly, I'm willing to get them at full price.  The best part is that all their tacos are served up with a lot of fish, shrimp, or chicken based on what you order! My favorite is an order of fish tacos with tartar sauce & a few of the salsas from their self-serve salsa bar. When I go on Tuesday's I usually get the three tacos but it is really filling. If I'm going on another day, I just stick to two tacos.  They're usually busy but still fast at getting orders out. I've been here multiple times and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on giving 5 stars on yelp, but this place deserves it.  I'm glad they decided to open a location in my neighborhood, I've been a handful of times since it has opened and always walk away satisfied. Simple, fresh fish tacos, and a good size too!  I suggest taking the time to eat there.....fish comes out nice and hot with the option to top with all kinds fixings and sauces. I've switched it up each time with the toppings , so many different combos..... Big ups for that!!!  If you are fiending for some fish tacos, make this place your first stop. Support a local business, down with the chains. This place is a weekly spot for sure."}
{"text":"They have the best hochata (so far ). As for the fish taco, I think Rubio has better fish taco. I cannot not \"taste\" the fish and it was too salty for me.The corntortilla tases like a regular corn  tortilla that you can buy at the store. Nothing special. I will be back for the horchata only! Oh, the salsa bar is nice, I mix chipotle+red sauce+ketchup for dipping my fries. The fries is crispy and good."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. It only gets four stars because there's no margaritas or beer. The carne asada street tacos are great and the condiments bar allows for your own creations. The fish tacos were tasty and filling too. The biggest drawback is that it's quickly becoming a popular place for lunch and it's not big enough and gets crowded quickly. Can't wait to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Had the fish machaca, which was spicy / flavorful / different but not too hot and was good, and the serving was generous.  They also had cooked (griddle?) whole jalapeños in the salsa bar, which is always appreciated.  The corn tortillas (which I like) ended up a bit soggy, which is due to the nature of the fish & veg filling, but doubled tortillas would be a good solution. Also, the rice appeared to be steamed and was OK, which is lighter, but is not Mexican. My buddy had carne asada, which he said was good."}
{"text":"The reviews are real. This place is fantastic...and CHEAP. The fish is nicely breaded and fried and the condiments are all-you-can-pile. I also had a chance to try the fish machaca and found it very pleasing to the taste buds. You can get two nicely sized tacos for $7. The free drink with yelp check-in is a LARGE. My only want is an option to have a flour tortilla instead. i love this place and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Just about the best fish taco I have ever had. Absolutely f'ing amazing. Great batter, not greasy tasting at all, and the sides for the tacos were so fresh! I will be back again, soon!"}
{"text":"Yum! Happy hour is a awesome! 3-6pm, 2$ fish tacos! What more could a white girl ask for! Except ranch dressing of course.."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos ever. The full taco is amazing and all of their sauces/salsas are so fresh."}
{"text":"Good tacos, but most everything is battered and fried. I had only a couple options since I'm gluten-free. They were still really good and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I got 2 fish tacos and tried my friends fries. I loved that you put all the toppings on yourself. The toppings tasted like they were just set out (we went around 12:30pm). The sauces were great! The fries were good potatoes and fried just right. My ONLY small issue was the tortillas coulda been cooked a little longer. I've had corn and flower tortillas and they haven't ever tasted this doughy. Super easy fix if you just ask for it to be cooked longer."}
{"text":"Received a flyer in the mail and decided to go and try this place. I ordered two fish tacos, and one chicken. The fish was AMAZING!! Chicken good as well. Not greasy at all, and I love the way they serve them plain so you determine what goes on them at the salsa bar. Highly recommend the fish.."}
{"text":"Pretty no-frills, but everything is excellent.  The tacos come plain, but you can add your own salsa, cabbage, etc.  Small location, so if you can visit during non-peak hours, you should get a table.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The fish was great quality, I could tell...but everything just tasted a bit bland.  I tried every single sauce they had and nothing really popped out at me.  I love fish tacos, but these could use some type of flavor...not sure why but it wasn't coming through."}
{"text":"Great and fresh tacos. Tried the battered fish, battered shrimp, and fish machaca tacos. Salsa bar has a lot of different choices for taco toppings. Everything was made to order. Batter was light and crisp. Fish was very flaky. Shrimp was firm with great flavor. The machaca was awesome! Wasn't sure I would like it as much as the others but I think it was actually my favorite. The quesadillas sounded great, so maybe I'll try one of those next time. Places was clean and staff was friendly. Def will go back."}
{"text":"Well, no false advertising here. They had tortillas and they had fish. It was my first time there and the lady at the front counter was able to take my order and complete my transaction for ordering food. I don't really have anything to compare it to but it wasn't bad by any means I can say that I am full now and I enjoyed the salsa bar which allowed me to customize my fish tacos to my liking. Clean environment, decent service and good fish tacos. It was everything I expected when I walked in and an overall good experience."}
{"text":"I dont eat fish tacos.... But I ate 4 of them here.  Torilla Fish's full taco will change anyone's opinion, even your taste buds! Everything is cooked to order so the fish comes out perfectly crispy and delicious.  All of the toppings are on the side, which was almost my favorite part.  The avocado sauce was my favorite.  The customer service was absolutely perfect.  This place definitely earned the title of best fish tacos in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what the name suggests. Tiny menu - fish tacos only - but they're yummy!  Pros: Nice salsa and topping selection, the staff were upbeat and helpful, the restaurant was clean and well maintained (it's brand new).  Cons: I would have liked more fresh salsa options, but they do what they do well.  Would definitely go back next time I'm over there at Costco or shopping for furniture!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. I order a combo fish taco and fries. I didn't get the fish taco or the fries. Got something else and no fries. Took them close to 30 minutes to give me the wrong order. Not coming here angain. If I could give no stars I would. Now I'm just hungry after that little bit of food I got. Not worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite place love this fish tacos and shrimp  tacos. Taco Tuesday is worth it buy two tacos get one free. It far from my house but I still go and nice portions they give you. All the fixings are good to put on your tacos especially  the slaw."}
{"text":"I stopped by here on my way home.  I like fish tacos and make them myself.  These are very very good. Simple delicious fish tacos, you add your toppings.  Cant get better than this unless you are in San Diego, at the beach, sippin on a beer.  Not 5 stars only because I dont believe in 5-out-of-5 for anything. Always leave room for improvement!"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. Was at work with a colleague and he said his buddy recommended this place. He ordered fish tacos and I got a mini Carne Asada quesadilla and a Carne Asada burrito. Half way through the burrito, I am thinking this doesn't taste right like something is off. So, I throw it in the trash and write it off as a bad decision. Well.... an hour later, it's a mad dash for the restroom and I had it coming out of both ends. And being a man with a great sense of humor, my colleague was teasing me about the incident. Well, 3 hours later, boom hits him and he got it also. He had fish tacos and I had steak. This happened 5/11/18. I was at work Saturday and today and he is still out and had to go to urgent care with a severe case of food poisoning. Don't know what happened, but I can't recommend this establishment or will I ever eat there again."}
{"text":"A small selection that's always great, some interesting sauses (i would recommend the chipotle), and staff that's always friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a little shocked that this place has such good reviews.  Maybe I went on an off day.  Based on the reviews, my sister and I went over for lunch.  I had checked in online to receive a free large drink.  I ordered two tacos and he informed me that it was taco Tuesday so I could either pick a free taco or use my free drink.  I thought it was weird I had to choose between the two.  I ordered a fish taco and the full taco.  I think it lacked flavor and it was soft and mushy, not crispy.  The salsa bar was just ok...lacked a lot of flavor as well.  The tarter sauce was pretty good, but that was all.  Like I said, it might have just been an off day, so I might try again in the future....based on the fact it seems like everyone loves it here."}
{"text":"Dine out once a week at least. Excellent food, plenty of dip selections and Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food was tasty. Was my 1st time and I got the fish taco (of course), it was really good. Fries are battered. I loved that part. They have a little condiment bar so you can make your taco, your way."}
{"text":"Best taco fish ever! Can never get tired! Amazing food, VERY friendly staff and very well priced food!! So good and nice place to stop by! LOVE LOVE LOVE their HUGE Mexican Coke bottle. Please never stop selling it! We have been coming here for a while and will always return. Never a bad experience. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I had the steamed fish tacos and they were really big.  I had to eat 2/3 of the filling with a fork before I could pick up the tacos.  These were the best fish tacos I have ever eaten.  They have a filling bar so you can top your fish any way you like.  I will be going back.  They offer steamed or fries fish and/or shrimp tacos.  Next time you go to Costco or Walmart, stop in Tortilla Fish for a taco.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos and fries are delicious.  Wonderful little joint for a meal en route to IKEA."}
{"text":"This was was decent. Ordered the fish tacos and full taco. Loved the fish tacos. The full tacos were okay, not as good as I was expecting."}
{"text":"Wanna Taco about it? There's something fishy going on here! I've been fishing since I could hold a  pole and I've never seen or caught a tortilla fish before! Now tacos that is something I can get a hold of, so when Monica O said let's go get some tacos for Taco Tuesday it was on! Buy 2 tacos & get 1 free sounded good to me, and as an extra Yelp check in bonus a free large drink all for the bargain price of 6 dollars. Now that's a catch, no fish story here! I ordered the 2 fish tacos and 1 chicken taco, the batter was light, the flavor was right, and the portions were big. No tiny throw back tacos here! You can order whichever tacos you like, mix and match but the fish tacos are definitely the catch of Tuesday!  The topping tank has a full selection of sauces, from mild chipotle to the hotter hot sauce and it's definitely hot, and for an added mouthful, cabbage and slaw, jalapenos and limes for squeezing!  I've never been a big fan of fish, fishing yes but eating it has never been at the top of my favorite foods list. I've already been back for more, Tortilla Fish has got me totally hooked!"}
{"text":"No false advertising here: this place served up fish in tortillas upon my demand for same. The restaurant is pretty basic in every regard: tables and chairs were minimalistic and fish tacos came unadorned to be dressed to your heart's content at the salsa bar.   This place is certainly not going to win any awards for \"most authentic Mexican\", but they did a decent fish taco that delivered what I was looking for: fish tacos in easy reach at any easy price.   Tortilla Fish is definitely not hiding the ball on their premise: what ya see (the name) is what you get (a fish taco)."}
{"text":"The 3 stars is for the salsa bar. We were in town, and went here when 2 Mexican seafood places we had hoped to try were closed. The battered fish tacos were nothing special...they were a bit over-fried and the oil tasted old. Using a combination of the different sauces from the salsa bar helped. Others got the seafood quesadillas and said they were bland; the only item with spiciness of its own was the \"machaca fish\" with veggies...a little soupy...would have made a better seafood stew.  The biggest disappointment was how limited the menu was. The \"aguas frescas\" they advertise....NOPE, only horchata. And that really quite excellent salsa bar....but they don't have any tortilla chips available! WTH??!! It was a deep disappointment not to be able to buy a basket of tortilla chips and try more of those salsas. Seems like they are missing a great profit opportunity...with wholesale bags of tortilla chips they could offer chips & salsa for sale, and even seafood nachos, and increase their profit margin. Not impressed. Will wait until we visit San Diego to eat seafood tacos and such."}
{"text":"I don't think the condiments are stored at the right temp or something. Absolutely can't eat the pico. Sends me to the bathroom 100% of the time and my co worker too. Everything else is great, just the pico."}
{"text":"It has been almost a year since I've been to this place and I still dream of coming back just for their battered and fried fish tacos. I came here for the first time on a whim because it was close to to where I was working and they had good reviews. Let me just say yelp didn't disappoint and I came here for three more cosecutive meals. The taco is euphoria enducing and crack-level good."}
{"text":"Food is good and fresh. Prices are reasonable. This is a small local restaurant. I told the waitress that this was my first visit and I was curious about the fish so she gave me a sample and it was delicious. The word \"taco\" is used but they use soft tortillas. I ordered the fish taco and quesadilla both delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"Ok so I have to be really honest. I came here expecting to have some awesome fish tacos, not amazing, just good. So the place is really clean and the employees are very friendly. The menu is not overwhelming, with enough options for anyone from any age. The salsa bar was fully stocked and very neat.... but here is what I did not like. There fish is chopped and battered, so its really hard to hold or to eat without looking a mess, especially if your like me and tries every sauce they offer lol. The fish was everywhere except the tortilla. After i managed to get past that, the flavors were actually ok, but thats about it. The fish was not crispy in any form, it felt like steamed bread stuffed with fish! The texture of the fish was nothing of what a real fish taco is. That was such a negative for me! All around not as cracked up to be, rubios is still better for a fast food fish taco and cheaper"}
{"text":"Tried this place out tonight after seeing a coupon in the mail. This place is in the South Tempe area and although I thought it might be chain like, it actually isn't. We met a gentleman who seemed like the owner or at least a key employee there. He helped us pick our order (I love when folks do that) and also recommended what salsas, toppings and sauce to try for what we ordered. I had the fish taco and the machacha fish taco - both were very yummy! The machacha is steamed fish with plenty of yummy seasoning (ask for a sample if you're curious) and the fish taco is delicious battered fish. The fish tasted fresh and the batter was amazing!! My husband tried the full taco (which he said was really good) and the governer's quesadilla which he wasn't a huge fan of as he felt the shrimp was a bit over-cooked. I would stick to the tacos here. Will definitely be going back as it definitely fulfilled my fish taco craving! YUM!!  ps - beware that they close early at 8pm. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! I don't tend to find many places that serve both Tacos and fries in a fast casual environment. The combo of those things alone makes this girl smile. But then on top of that the food is good! Made fresh to order always hot and crispy. Let's talk about the salsa/condiment bar. Dress up your own tacos with delicious options. I haven't tried any of the salads yet, but they look great too. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Quick really good food at great price. I would be back here again and again. The food taste fresh and love the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Been here twice in a week and I'm already planning yet another visit tomorrow for their Taco Tuesday special. The fish taco and full taco are spectacular, and the refreshing aguas frescas make the perfect beverage to accompany these delights. The tacos are \"plain\" when handed to you; from there you dress it up with the freshest toppings and salsas from the toppings bar; my favorite topping combination is their creamy slaw with the pickled red onions and jalapeños. Service is fast and friendly, there's a cool patio area, and free WIFi is always a good thing."}
{"text":"The breading on the fish is perfect. The fish is mouth watering good. You need to come here. Inexpensive GOOD food. They deserve your business."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, they only lose one star for me because their menu is pretty darn heavy and not super diverse. That being said, if you're looking for delicious, albeit not-so-calorie conscious food, they're tops. Their customer service is excellent too, as their manager (or owner, not sure his role?) seemed so genuinely happy to have my business as a new customer. Food is fresh and tasty, with lots of complimentary add-on options at their little salsa bar."}
{"text":"I love this place for a quick, healthy (I always get the fish machaca), and delicious lunch!  I load up on the different toppings and sauces and always feel good after eating here.  Reuben (the owner) is always there, and I fully support small businesses like this one and hope that it continues to be successful!  Keep it Up!"}
{"text":"Amazing! So Fresh! Everything is legit. The owner & staff were super friendly & involved."}
{"text":"I love their fish, shrimp and full taco! You have to try these ! The salsa bar is amazing and everything tastes and looks clean! I'm so glad they opened one closer to work! A Must try"}
{"text":"Delicious food, and reasonable prices! Everything is really fresh! The staff is super nice! Definitely check this place out. I had the fish machaca taco, oh I savored every single bite. This is a comfortable happy place to eat. Yes, they do take out orders over the phone."}
{"text":"I was told that I must go here by another amazing Yelper and boy was he right, this place is amazing! The tacos come plain and then you pack them with toppings from their fabulous salsa bar that has everything that you could ever want on your taco! The bar consists of a ton of salsas, hot sauces, jalapenos, cabbage, slaw, avocado sauce, homemade ranch, tartar sauce, cucumbers, pickles onions,  limes... seriously, you name it, it is there! I ordered their beer battered fish tacos and holy yum, I was in heaven! On Taco Tuesday, it is buy 2 tacos, get 1 free! ...Can't beat that! We may be regulars here very soon!"}
{"text":"Very good fish tacos as well as a great taco bar.  Would go back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Super excited I found a new treasure! Best tacos! I will definitely  recommend and will be back!! Back again for the fantastic happy hour tacos! Check in if your a helper for your free soda :) Fantastic as the first time :)))) yummy"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh meal. I had the Fish Machaca and my husband had the Fried Fish Tacos with fries. Both were perfectly seasoned, deliciously put together and piping hot.  The salsa bar had everything we like, plus chipotle fry sauce and tasty slaw for the tacos.  We hope our travels find Tortilla Fish wherever we go."}
{"text":"I have traveled in Mexico pretty extensively. Both coasts and Yucatan. Have eaten a wide variety of seafood, and this place is pretty damn good. Taco Tuesday is great if you can eat a lot, as it's buy 2 get one free. And they're not the small street taco size either. It's the full on regular tortilla. Fish is battered and fried, no other choice. But it's crispy, fresh and plenty. Also had the fried shrimp here and it's firm, fresh and crispy too. The salsa and condiment bar is really vast in getting your meal just the way you want it. Could use some work on the drink area. But, refills are free. The only other local choice for dependable fish tacos was Rubios. Pretty good, but, not the taste and value that T.F. is. So, if you're looking for original, non chain food, then give this place a try."}
{"text":"Was really craving a burrito but this place is really good everything fresh !! I highly recommend very friendly staff too !!"}
{"text":"I ordered some fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and a mix. They were all very bland, despite putting the toppings on them. They were also overly greasy. The customer service was horrible- they didn't know how to ring my order and over charged me."}
{"text":"The BEST fish tacos I have ever had!!  My husband and I love this place and are making this a must stop every IKEA trip we make!!  The full and machaca are super good also their fries are very good I even scooped up the extra machaca with my fries and that is a tasty treat!!  They also have amazing ranch dressing!!  Thank you Tortilla Fish!!"}
{"text":"I'm breaking my usual 'two visit\" rule for Tortilla Fish but there's a good reason; It was just THAT good!!  I met up with the girl for lunch on my day off, kind of leery about what I was getting into because I'm not really a fan of fish tacos. But I gotta give the local guys a shot and I'm glad I did.  Ordered the shrimp tacos, added beer battered fries for the table and snagged the free drink check-in offer. Didn't have to wait long for our tacos and was pleasantly surprised to find that they don't pre-build the tacos for you. After they cook up your fish and put it in a fresh corn tortilla, you get to put the rest of it together using the nearby bar. This is a HUGE plus for me because far too often I've had fish tacos elsewhere that were drenched with some nasty mayo based cream sauce that I can't stomach. Here though, I was able to load my shrimps up with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, some bomb salsa, and cilantro. WORD OF WARNING: They are not exaggerating about their heat levels. When they say hot, they mean hot. I went with the hottest salsa and got a good burn going, despite how used to spicy food I am. So choose with caution. One of the staff members was kind enough to give a couple of recommendations on what to put on the tacos as well which I'm glad I listened to them because I would have missed out on the cilantro sauce.  The end result? Freakin' excellent! Very fresh fish and fantastic toppings. Found out after I'd inhaled my first taco that all the sauces are made in house daily which explains why it tastes freakin amazing and fresh. The beer battered fries were also great. I recommend sharing them though because you get quite a bit.  Overall, a great dining experience and great customer service. My only gripe is that they close a bit earlier than other taco restaurants which makes it difficult for me to eat there for dinner given my work hours. Otherwise I'm glad I gave them a try. Will definitely need to come here again sometime soon."}
{"text":"This place is evil, had a house in Mexico for a couple years on the beach, and nothing even down there compares to the fish tacos here.  Taco Tuesday, 3 full tacos for $7 bucks you guys are killin me, can't stop eating here dammit"}
{"text":"3 for 2 Tuesday's is a steal for this taco shop and the food is made fresh at time of order.  The side condiments compliment the tacos perfectly.  Would highly recommend to any taco lovers in the valley to try once.  You will be hooked!  Lunch time is packed, so order ahead or go in after"}
{"text":"Awesome! I usually get 2 full tacos and split the fries with my wife. I recommend this place to everyone who likes tacos and seafood."}
{"text":"Great fish and shrimp tacos!! Try the governador quesadilla which is a combination of both and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is no upscale Roy's, it's a simple taco shop. But the one thing they've got that Roy's hasn't got...Fish tacos! And great fish tacos at that!  I was visiting from Washington state and was craving fish tacos. I Yelped and found this place just two blocks from where I was parked. GREAT staff! Reasonably priced and great tasting fish and shrimp tacos. Just what I was craving. My family gets into town at the end of the week and we'll be back...more than once, I'm sure! Oh, and a great salsa bar too! Be sure to try mixing the avacado, cilantro and Chipotle sauces together...AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"This place has great fish tacos.  The tacos come plain, however their salsa bar has lots of toppings available. I especially liked their Chipotle sauce. The review that says the portions are small,  I don't know what they're referring to. The tortilla is a regular size corn tortilla,  and it is FILLED with delicious fried fish.   The restaurant is small and clean.  The owner I believe is very friendly and attentive.  Just the service alone makes you want to return again."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out based on all the rave reviews. The location threw me a little bit, being located in a strip mall across from Walmart. Once inside however, it's clear the owners really care about the store. Very clean, and the employees are very welcoming.  My girlfriend and I split an order of fish tacos and fries. I put their Tatar sauce, coleslaw, hot sauce, and chipotle sauce on mine. My god, the reviews can't do it justice. Let me say that I'm not normally a huge fan of fish, but the fish was so melt-in-your-mouth-delicious, you can't help but fall in love. The fries alone are worth a visit. Even splitting an order, I was full."}
{"text":"We were looking to grab a quick bite as we'd just arrived in town and were starving! The Yelp reviews brought us in and this place did not disappoint!!  We ordered carne asada, fish and shrimp tacos.  Everything was so good ~ nice portions, fresh and tasty. The condiment bar had great choices to load up on ~ cole slaw, cabbage, onions, jalapeños, lime, cucumbers, pick de gallo, and a variety of sauces. You order at the counter and pick up when your number is called. Employees were very friendly and service was fast. It hit the spot and was so good we went back again the next day for some more! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome and the manager is such a cool dude always remembers my name even remembers my order. Highly recommend this place do fish tacos. Insane topping bar."}
{"text":"LOVE Tortilla Fish. I wish I lived in Tempe just so I could have lunch at TF every weekend. On our first visit the store had only been open a few weeks and everything looked clean, fresh and unique. Friendly service too. We tried the shrimp and fish tacos and DAMN they were good. The horchata was okay but what I really enjoyed about the place besides the AMAZING TACOS was their fresh toppings bar. Tons of salsa and veggies to top off your tacos. Will come again and order more tacos next time. :)"}
{"text":"Fish tacos - fast casual - pretty tasty.  I had the 2 taco combo (2 tacos, fries and a small drink).  I got one fish taco, and one 'full' taco (fish, shrimp and cheese-stuffed yellow pepper).    The fish taco was good - you put your own cabbage/salsa/whatever on it at the salsa bar.  The full taco was better - the cheese-stuffed pepper put it over the top. The fries were good, but there were waaaaaayyyy too many of them for one person.  I used the Yelp checkin offer of a free large drink, but the combo still came out to $10...seemed a little high for what it was."}
{"text":"Great Mexican seafood at a reasonable price. The menu is limited. My wife and daughter shared a Campechano platter (two combination fish/shrimp tacos, plus french fries). I had the Gobernador shrimp quesadilla. They feature a full salsa bar, with cabbage and coleslaw, a mild green sauce, and a spicy and really hot red sauce. They also have a  tartar sauce. All of the sauces are made in the restaurant. The food was very good and -- at this price, combined with the superb service, rates 5 stars. They also serve horchata and jacaima as well as yanqui beverages. The tacos were good; the fish breaded and fried. The shrimp quesadilla was terrific. The fries are fried very crispy (some sort of batter?) but are left for you to season."}
{"text":"Love these fish tacos.  I'm sure others have mentioned it but you get your tacos with fish.   And thats it.  Then head to the salad and salsa bar and make them any way you like.  Worst thing I can say is they over filled my tortilla with fish.   I had to eat a bite then add my cabbage and salsa.   Will go back again soon."}
{"text":"Some of the best fish tacos in AZ! Had the full taco and machaca taco and was very pleased with both. I wish my stomach could hold more because I wanted to try more of the condiments from the salsa bar. Overall a great spot if you're craving a GOOD fish taco."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review on behalf of myself and Rob, my boyfriend, since I carry the Yelp torch in our relationship. We discovered Tortilla Fish during one of our late night trips to Walmart. We totally drooled over the idea of a little taco shop (Rob especially, as he loves tacos from San Felipe). We promised that we would go back during business hours.  Yesterday, we were in the area and decided to stop at Tortilla Fish. Not sure what to expect, we walked in to Tortilla Fish's TOTALLY ADORABLE little restaurant. The walls are blue with some fun subway tile, with lots of beautiful photos. Clean and cozy are two of the words that come to my mind. I got so excited when I later noticed the sea shells in the subway tile. So cute and original.  The employees were really friendly, especially when we told them it was our first time in. They gave us recommendations, told us about their best sellers, and even gave us some sauce combinations to try. Supremo customer service at this place.  I ordered two shrimp tacos and a cup of water. Rob got the full taco, a fish taco, and a soda. I think the total came to $15.22, which I thought was quite reasonable for two people. The tacos were $2.99-ish each, so I could easily see spending more than $15 if you came in HUNGRY.  Our order came up after only a few minutes, and OH BOY! The shrimp in my tacos were HUGE and there were plenty of them. Two thumbs up for emphasis on the SHRIMP in shrimp tacos. The fish in Rob's taco was stacked so high, he grabbed a fork (but didn't end up using it except to clean out the dish when we had finished).  I used the avocado and cilantro sauces on my tacos, with cabbage and onion and fresh cilantro, and all I can say is YUM YUM YUM. And the corn tortillas? Brilliant. Very soft and tasty-- though a word to the wise, if you plan to overload your taco with accessories, the tortilla may break (which, for most of us, is no problem. Give me a fork or I'll eat it with my fingers. Tastes good all the same). Lastly, I really appreciated that the contents of the salad bar are clearly fresh; they looked pretty and tasted great too.   Rob LOVED the full taco and the fish taco (to quote him, \"all that was missing was a beach with no surf\"). He used a combination of pico de gallo, cilantro sauce, and (I think) the extra spicy salsa. We were definitely a fan of this little place, so I think we will be returning soon.  Rob and I  say four out of five stars and would definitely recommend if you are in the mood for some clean, tasty tacos.  PS: Don't forget your phone in the car, because you get 15% off your order with your first Yelp check in. No worries, I will save it for our next visit!  -------------Update!--------------- After writing this review today, and then reading it over with Rob, we decided to go back to Tortilla Fish for lunch. That's right, less than 24 hours from our initial visit, we returned. And AGAIN, the food was delicious.  The employees remembered us, said \"Welcome back!\" and thanked us. A+ guys. Thank YOU!  I tried the fish taco today and WHOA. I think it is my new favorite. The fish was so moist and delicious it melted in my mouth. Topped with cilantro and avocado sauce and fresh cabbage, onion, and cilantro again, definitely a win.  Also...do yourself a favor and get the french fries. No, seriously. When one of the  employees said \"We have the best fries I have ever tasted\" I was skeptical, but I think he's onto something.  These fries were EASILY some of the best I've ever had, if not the best. They're a nice size and density, and are even a little flakey on the outside. Serious and overwhelming yum for these fries. Oh, and for a tasty treat, drip them in the chipotle sauce. Really flavorful and smokey. Thumbs up, all around.  Rob had two full tacos this time and was just as pleased today as he was yesterday. Bumping up to a 5 star from my original 4. Tortilla fish, we'll DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"They have super yummy Fish Tacos! I like going on Taco Tuesday when Tacos are buy two get one free. It is a small restaurant so seating is limited. If you going during peak times it's better to just get it to go because there is sometimes nowhere to sit."}
{"text":"We are new to Phoenix and wanted to find a Mexican food place nearby our home. We were welcomed as we entered the location. The food combo tacos shells seemed small but just enough for two petite girls. It was perfectly portioned. The salsa bar was great, you could add whatever toppings you wanted on your taco. I am sure we will be back again before we leave Phoenix. The food was so delicious, I ate the taco in about 5 mins. You must try this place, not too hard to find. Tortilla Fish is located in the strip plaza in the Walmart complex on W Elliot. in Tempe."}
{"text":"Casual and quick, I like to stop by here on my lunch breaks and get their fantastic battered fish tacos. Always fresh made and $2.99 each but they do have B2G1 on Taco Tuesdays. What really makes this place the bomb is their salad/condiments bar. They have pickled cucumbers, onions, coleslaw, tartar sauce, different salsas and a creamy avocado sauce that elevate pretty much anything to the next level. Make sure to sign up for their loyalty program as they text you specials ever so often!"}
{"text":"First time at Tortilla Fish. Arrived at 11:30 on a Tuesday for lunch. There were 10 customers already eating. The storefront was impeccably clean and the menu was easy to navigate.   I ordered two battered fish tacos. Since it's Tuesday, (taco Tuesday), I received an extra taco. They were cooked fresh and were ready in about 7 mins.   The salsa bar was nicely stocked with anything you could want on a taco. I took tarter sauce, chipotle aioli and cilantro aioli.   The three tacos came to only $6.46. They were actually a little more than I could eat.   I recommend Tortilla Fish for a quick, inexpensive, filling bite of taco goodness."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Glad we had a coupon. Prices were decent. Fries were very tasty and we liked the salsa bar. Fish was fine but kind of bland. Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Very authentic. Taco sauces are made in house. The owner Francisco was very nice."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!!! That's all I can say. Must try!loved the shrimp and fish taco. The batter makes it amazing! Also tried the steak and shrimp and it was amazing! Was so good I had to order for my staff. Called on taco Tuesday and ordered over 60 tacos. Service and food was excellent!"}
{"text":"You have to dress your own fish taco? Seriously? This restaurant so-called goes down there with all of the Subways and Cici's and other restaurants where they are just downright lazy and don't want to offer good food. They make the basics, but you have to do all the work of making it taste better than something you could make at home. No thanks. I go to a restaurant to get food prepared and served by others, not to make it myself. My advice: stop enabling these lazy places by patronizing them and force them to figure out how to please the public. This place reminds me of a diner I stopped at in rural Wisconsin once. I asked for a steak sandwich, and they pan-fried a slab of tough, low-quality beef and slapped it on two dry slices of white bread. Well, I did ask for a steak sandwich..."}
{"text":"Good prices for quality of food. They have a varied salsa bars with a few different slaws."}
{"text":"If you like fried fish and shrimp tacos this is your spot! Slaw/sauce/salsa bar is great. Yum!  Friendly staff, good fries, small place with big flavor and good vibes."}
{"text":"My personal experience would be a 2 star but I have eating habits that don't mix with their menu. I'm giving one extra star because often own personal eating habits are unique.   First - I hate onions and don't like deep fried food, especially fish. They have literally nothing that's served without onions unless you get it deep fried. They have shrimp and other not fried fish but it's in a funky looking congealed mix that included onions.   Honestly, if I wasn't really hungry and in a hurry I would've left. Instead I ordered a quesadilla with fried shrimp. Not the healthy meal I was hoping for but...it is what it is. It was okay. Nothing rave worthy.   The girl taking orders was sick and cranky. Rather wish they had sent her home. I don't like sick people so close to my food. There was a younger guy that was refilling the salsa bar. He was very friendly and the other reason for the star uptick.   I won't be back but others love this place so I'm sure they'll be in business for a long time."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday = buy 2 get 1 FREE... solid big filling tacos.  after 2, I was full... but had to finish the 3rd.  Eat there. Becomes soggy by the time you get home with it."}
{"text":"This is bar none the best taco shop PERIOD.  The fish is fresh and lightly battered...   there is nothing on this menu I don't love .. if you haven't been here - why not?"}
{"text":"The staff is awesome! They love working here. Not robotic. Friendly...owner is very genuine. Food rocks!"}
{"text":"I don't see what others do about this place. The fried fish has to much tasteless batter, and the steamed fish was bland. Grilled fish is the best, but they don't make that. Never again."}
{"text":"This is a great small restaurant, great service and food was delicious! Try the Full taco and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is just as good as the other location. Fresh food and lots of toppings. The dining area is much nicer than the other location considering it is such a new location! Pretty friendly service. But there are a few things I noticed: 1. Make sure to let them know you want the happy hour price otherwise you will be charged regular pricing. 2. Also they charge 50 cents for debit purchases under $6 so be sure to bring cash."}
{"text":"I kept wanting to try this place out but didn't have the time until a couple of days ago. The menu is very simple you pick a type of taco them u dress it yourself. I got a fish taco and a shrimp taco. I dressed it with nearly everything that was available and took it home to try. Boy were they bomb! I love that I can customize it with all of MY favorite toppings. Yummy!  The fish and shrimp were battered perfectly and fresh. They are not quite Tijuana tacos but they are pretty darn close! My only complaint was how easily the tortilla falls apart. I had to eat mine with a fork.   Tip: please utilize their happy hour. You get a fish taco half price from 3-6 everyday! :)"}
{"text":"We love this taco shop! Best fish tacos in Arizona. Our kids eat well here, too. Favorites are the machaca fish taco and the Campechano (fish & shrimp)"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place based on the reviews and the fact that I am at Frys or Costco all of the time and it is right around the corner. We stopped in today for a quick snack. The fish tacos are amazing. They hand battered them in front of us and the steak burrito was great too. I love the condiment bar because you can put whatever you want on your food! The prices are also very reasonable for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"This place is glorious. I've been twice, and thought it was in a weird location but it's so tasty.  I usually go to places like rubios or chipotle, but this is a bit closer to the house (and is overall more authentic).   I love the fish tacos here, and the crazy assortment of salsas to go with. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Fast,  delicious , friendly and very reasonable! A must try! Love the fresh condiment bar!"}
{"text":"I am so glad that I deiced to check out this place that is so close to my office.  I have yet to order something that I did not like.  The tacos are amazing!  They also have a great salsa and condiments bar.  You are able to dress up your tacos however you want.  Don't forget about taco Tuesday!  Get three for the price of two."}
{"text":"Not as good as I expected. They chopped the fish cube sizes instead full. And they're super dry for fish tacos. And there's no some mexican side like most of mexican resto. Not really going to come back."}
{"text":"Freaking love these fish tacos.  A lot of food for a low price and tons of topping and dipping options.  Can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Holy Moly! I love this place! I live less than a mile away and I had a awkward experience at one of the other Mexican food restaurants near by and wanted to avoid that at all cost! So I came here and got a Shrimp Burrito and blown away by all the awesome options they had! It was utter bliss and I laid at home in a food coma from how delicious it was! Next day we went back with my mom and got the chips are dank -- like you don't understand! These were awesome chips! We both thought it was great! Friendly staff who recommend stuff too you and ask how you like your items. All extremely sweet! 11/10!"}
{"text":"Good was fair. Was much more of a fast food, counter type place than I had originally visioned."}
{"text":"So bad, equivalent of long john silver fish tacos and fries but waaaay more expensive. Not sure how this place has 4.5 out of 5 stars. The salsa bar is tiny you have to wait to get salsa and if your lucky there will be some left or some you can squeeze out of the nasty communal squeeze bottles everyone and their mother has been grabbing on...and also the nasty floor, from the door to the counter looked like a trail of dirt in an auto parts store. This is yet another example how yelp is loosing its dignity of a trustworthy review app to an over populous teen and tween review board showing their lack of experience and food expertise by just yelping to yelp, positive or other wise but definitely not educated. Because hands down this place sucked."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous fish taco shop! Great homemade sauces and perfectly cooked fish, shrimp and barbacoa! Plus they are incredibly nice! Perfect little joint!"}
{"text":"I have made my way back to this little taco joint finally and I must say, it has to be one of my favorite places for lunch now. I do appreciate how polite they are to their customers and the food is always fresh. Btw, if you ever have the taste for REALLY good French fries, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm not particularly impressed with this place. There's a lot of hype, but I simply don't see why. The tacos I've had have been good, not great. My favorite thing was probably the Shrimp quesadilla, because it was nice and gooey, but I otherwise don't care for the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, asada tacos or barbacoa tacos very much."}
{"text":"Lean, healthy and flavorful the 'fish machaca' is unique and full of wonder. Steamed, spiced, marinated cod dish.  Add chopped cabbage and pico de gallo- wow! six stars."}
{"text":"Fish Machaca, it may sound weird and when they explain it as steamed seasoned fish as the healthy option you may be suspicious.  Don't be it is an amzing flavor and texture filling with in a simple corn tortilla.   Part of the fun here is the salsa/ slaw bar, Yes slaw 2 types sauces salsa and more to customize your taco as you want it. The sesame chili oil goes best of the fish machaca as anything heavier would mask the savory flavors.    The fried fish was done well too, not over cooked and crispy.  You are are not in to seafood your only option is a quesadilla, but I think this place may get you in to seafood.  My only grip is the price to amount of food. Tacos are $3 each and 2 of them make a small meal."}
{"text":"I really enjoy how everything is made fresh and quickly.  The salsa bar has a wide variety of sauces and toppings.  I also believe it is priced well for what you get.  I would recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"JUST GO HERE. Seriously the best fish tacos I've ever had! Everything is made fresh on the spot. The owner rings you up and is helpful and friendly. Prices are good too. I can't wait to go back here!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant is very nice the restaurant was also clean I didn't like the food at first but I'm going to give this place a second chance cuz everybody deserves a second chance.  I didn't realize it was a build your own taco that's why they have a salsa bar with avocado cilantro salsa Pico. Otherwise the restaurant seems clean the cashier was friendly and the place was busy. All good signs that it's a good restaurant to try"}
{"text":"Ok I was looking for some fish tacos and came across this place. If you are looking for fish tacos  than look no  further. Because pretty much that is all they sell. Well that and shrimp. They do also have chicken. Everything is lightly battered.  I got the the shrimp/fish combo tacos. Damn! So good. They have a great salsa/fixing bar that you can load up on the tacos. The  only down side is that they only have fries, no chips? Which is why I took one star off. The guys who own it are great and will give you the 411 on what to try at the salsa bar. Cheap and and the tacos are big. I get two of them and am stuffed."}
{"text":"I love fish tacos and I'm pretty picky when it comes to fish anything. If you like Rubio's this place will not disappoint. You get the basics in your taco and can decorate as you please at their salsa/salad bar. Would like the fish inside to be in smaller chunks though."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the FISH TACO. Delicious every time, all the time! Must check out the medium sized salsa bar as well. Sooo good"}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday.  I had the machaca fish tacos and they were delicious and served very quickly.  I added the shredded cabbage and some other cabbage that was more like coleslaw.  If I lived in Phoenix, I would try other stuff on the menu.  It was also inexpensive which is nice. Definitely will go there next time I'm in Phoenix and in that area."}
{"text":"Small taco shop with friendly staff. I ordered 2 chicken tacos and 1 shrimp taco. I was surprised to see that both the chicken and shrimp were batteries but when I looked at the menu again it says battered under chicken, fish, and shrimp.   The tacos come out plain with just the meat in a tortilla. There is a bar area off to the side with all the fillings so you can customize your taco. I just added pico, guacamole, and hot sauce and ended up with some great tasting tacos. If I came again I'd probably just get the shrimp."}
{"text":"How did it take so long for me to come here? I can't tell you how many times I've driven by.  I just decided that today was the day. Delicious fish taco and shrimp taco, all dressed up with all sorts of delicious stuff from the condiment/ veggie bar. It won't be so long before I'm back again. Taco Tuesday, anyone?"}
{"text":"Was thinking Chipotle, then realized it was Tuesday so I almost went to Rubios. Suddenly remembering I had seen this place while driving by. So glad I came in here instead!  Privately owned and operated. One of the owners was behind the counter and rang me up. Very friendly and very helpful. Lucked out with it being Taco Tuesday, got to add an extra taco to my combo! Went with 3 of their fish options. The Full Taco was huge and freakin delicious.  Definitely worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"Normally, I love this place...but, my last meal here was disappointing.    I stopped in after a doctor's appointment where I was just informed that I need to lower my A1C...meaning, cut the carbs.  My usual meal here is the fried fish and fries plate, which is not what I needed. I asked the staff for a healthier option, and they pointed me toward the Fish Machaca, which is seasoned steamed fish on a bed of greens.  I took their suggestion, and it was lackluster to say the least. First of all, it wasn't well seasoned, and there was so very little of the actual fish that I felt totally swindled.   I should have gone with my first thought and gotten the fried fish over a bed of greens, because that tablespoon of steamed fish tasted like nothing...I had to add a bunch of toppings from the salsa bar to get any real flavor.   You live and you learn, next time I'll stick to what I know and my review will probably be nicer, cuz normally the food here is yummy!"}
{"text":"Great tacos at a great price especially on Tuesdays where they have fish tacos at a cheaper price. You can also get just the fish (fried) if you want. Awesome salsa bar."}
{"text":"I've read the reviews for Tortilla Fish. And after my second attempt to enjoy this concept, all I can say is, what's the big deal?!  I was accompanied by the usual co-worker suspects for lunch today. And while they seemed to enjoy their Carne Asada Tacos, I was less than impressed by what I presume is their specialty. The name is on the door. And on my plate were some corn tortillas with fried fish. The portion was decent. The price was reasonable. I even liked the batter on the fish.  But the fish itself is flavorless and mushy. It really lacks texture. Once you get past the flavor and crispy texture of the batter, all you get is a very soft bite of (I presume) tilapia? It may even be flounder for all I know. Either way, I can think of at least a dozen other places that I've enjoyed better fish tacos.  I will give them props for an original salsa bar that features limes, cilantro and onions, salsa and hot sauce, plus tartar sauce.  Maybe I will try the Carne Asada next time. But considering Tortilla Fish can't make a decent fish taco, maybe I will just go someplace that I already know can make a great street taco."}
{"text":"Greasy and lacked flavor. No carbonation in soda. Disappointing given the other good reviews."}
{"text":"Tacos  good not too bad of a price especially on taco Tuesday and free French fries Friday staff really nice and welcoming"}
{"text":"Came here because of the good reviews on Yelp for 5 de Mayo. There was almost NO ONE there until about 15 min til closing, then suddenly everyone started piling in.  Parking - got a spot right out front, probably easier in the evening than during the day (panda Express is right next door).  Plenty of choices from the menu, even have a kids menu, and a little glass-roofed food bar with cut up onions, salsas, etc that you can add to your dish or have them cook it in for you.  Pleasant guy at the counter.  My husband says this place is pricey for a taco shop. He goes to the taco shops all the time. He also said his food was mediocre. The rest of us thought our food tasted good.  Now to the only bad thing, which in this case is really, really bad and an easy fix (I am so grossed out, I knocked off 2 stars): As I sat there eating and watching the latecomers pouring in, I looked up for some reason. Above that little salsa bar on the ceiling is the return air vent. Extremely covered in a thick, thick chunk-layer of dust?? Or something...parts of it had chunked off and must have succumbed to gravity.  I shuddered and was glad I hadn't wanted any salsas or anything for my food.   Please, do some light housekeeping once a week. And maybe change the filter, too. Otherwise, great little place."}
{"text":"i must tell you, this place HAS to be THE best kept secret in town!  we went in on a Saturday night and immediately greeted with smiles and suggestions.  the menu is simple, the salsa bar is amazing and the tacos were OUT. OF. THIS. WORLD!!!  in the mood for some fish tacos?  look no further.  this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Seriously, the best fish tacos in the valley. They are a great size and just the right amount of breading. The fish is juicy and delicious and the homemade sauces just top it off. The staff is great and the place is extremely clean. Go for taco Tuesday, such a great deal!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Love all the Tacos. However, it can get confusing. The first time my friend and I went there, if you order a combo, you get a third taco free or something. So now we just order two tacos each and split fries or something. It's a lot of food! But it's very tasty and cheap."}
{"text":"Went this weekend with the groupon. Was very good. And the price is awesome!! I'm telling everyone at my office and am actually going back for lunch today! I got the fish taco and the machaca taco both were very good we also had the fries they were also very good however I could do with out them 2 tacos are plenty for a filling lunch. Very small menu but it makes it easy to choose and what they do they do very well. Today I plan on getting the machaco taco again and I'm gonna try the shrimp taco and just looked on their website and on Tuesdays it's buy 2 get 1. Not sure I can eat 3 tacos but I'm happy to see I get my monies worth. Update: After going back for lunch today the shrimp taco is my favorite. Soooo good!!"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos!  Very authentic Baja style food.  The salsa bar is delish. We love coming here."}
{"text":"Fish tacos had a good flavor and good variety of toppings. I also tried their carna asada and wasn't impressed as it wasn't that flavorful. Establishment was pretty clean and they were friendly."}
{"text":"After seeing all the love Yelp has given Tortilla Fish I decided to try them out.  Tortilla Fish is best visited on Tuesday as you get Taco Tuesday deal. I recommend the Fish and Shrimp tacos. Prices are reasonable. I only spent $12.57 including $2 tip for service.  Get limes or salsa and you will be good! I recommend."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in AZ.    They don't skimp on the fish. And the fries are a huge order and super tasty as well.  The sauces are thick and not all watered down like other resteraunts ending in \"Bertos\" 5 stars easy."}
{"text":"It was a Friday night around 6:30pm when I placed my order and it was busy. So busy that it was a true 15 minute wait after placing my order, but it means made to order.  They were out of the of Barbacoa taco so I settled on the fish and the shrimp taco.  Tasty fish/batter and it was even nice to pile on the salsa/dressing bar which it made it more filling.  Cabbage both green and red, limes, pico de gallo, and onions tasted fresh.  I paid $7 for both and I thought it was a nice treat.  Better than Rubios, I think. I like that it is around other national chain restaurants so I think supporting a local one is good amongst the Walmart/Costco, Subway, Panda, Burger King."}
{"text":"This place has opened at just the right time.  The quality at America's continues to decline and Rubios fish tacos are more breading than fish these days.  I think we might have found our new weekday go to place for Mexican.  Fresh and flavorful fish that can be dressed a variety of ways as well as a few other solid earth bound options.  Also, a friendly staff that works hard to ensure your experience is up to par."}
{"text":"Great fish and shrimp tacos!  Also have some barbacoa and I think chicken available.  Very similar to the \"taco fish\" you get in Sonora, Mexico.  Go there on taco Tuesday and eat up."}
{"text":"I've gone here a lot over the past couple of months, and all I can say is it's very deserving of its current 4.5 star rating. The fish tacos are excellent and the service is even better - very nice people."}
{"text":"This place is a little different. Good tacos but not much selection.. Good service, clean establishment. Its a go to if you want something different."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is outstanding, and for the price it is a tremendous deal.  - If you haven't tried it the \"Full\" is probably one of if not the best item on the menu."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool little Taco Shop that is tucked away in the plaza with the giant ghetto Walmart located in the northeast block off Priest & Elliot...  I am not a huge fan of fried food or fish in general, so I tried their Barbacoa Tacos, and they were pretty good after applying the fixings from their in house Salsa Bar.    I gave a solid 4 star rating because I have had better tasting Barbacoa Taco's, but for the very reasonable price point in comparison to the large portion size I really can't complain.  It's priced very fairly with respect to the quality/quantity of food you are getting.  I do wish they had more non-friend options for chicken and shrimp though for the healthy taco eaters like myself out there ... And I wish their Barbacoa was flavored/seasoned a bit better.  But, those are the only two things that can be reasonably criticized at this very well run establishment.  Taco Tuesday specials are awesome - buy 2 get 1 free!! You can't go wrong there if you are in the mood to celebrate Taco Tuesday!  Additionally, the staff was friendly, helpful and the facility is nicely decorate and clean.... So, I'm definitely a fan on Taco Tuesday (it is a 4 star Review when I get a free taco or two, but if it was an ordinary day I would give it a solid 3.5, and I may go elsewhere) Try them out for yourself and yelp about it! ;)"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Tortilla Fish, the food wasn't bad, the food was just okay in my opinion. On this visit I ordered a fish and barbocoa taco.  The staff at Tortilla Fish are friendly and acomdating.  I enjoyed being able to watch my tacos being prepared. The fish taco was breaded, deep fried, and then placed onto a fresh warm tortilla, as was the barbocoa. Once my tacos were ready I headed over to the salad cart to add  ingredients of my choice. The salad cart offered lots of options, chopped avocado, tomato, cole slaw, cilantro, salsas, home made tartar sauce, everything and anything you would want on a taco.   All the ingredients on the salad cart  were fresh. I wish that the fish and barbocoa tacos had a better taste. The Fish and barbocoa were fresh, however,  both lacked seasoning and tasted somewhat bland. I didn't care for the tortilla's, which tasted dry and fell apart on the barbocoa taco. The tacos just weren't very good.  Maybe I will revisit in the near future and try something else."}
{"text":"Second time still disappointed  This was my second visit to a Tortilla Fish restraunt, the food just isn't very good in my opinion. On this visit I ordered a fish and barbocoa taco and just like my first visit, I was disappointed. Maybe I'm just not a fan of fish tacos.  The staff at Tortilla Fish are always friendly and acomdating.  I enjoyed being able to watch my tacos being prepared. The fish taco was breaded, deep fried, and then placed onto a fresh warm tortilla, as was the barbocoa. Once my tacos were ready I headed over to the salad cart to add  ingredients of my choice.

The Fish and barbocoa were fresh, however,  both lacked seasoning and tasted very bland, the tacos had very little flavor. I didn't care for the tortillas. The tacos just weren't very good."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  It was buy 2 get 1 taco on Tuesday so I ended up getting 3 barbacoa two fish and 1 chicken. It was roughly only $13 for that amount of food. The barbacoa and fish we're excellent.  There's a huge variety of fresh toppings and all look to be homemade including the sauces.  The coleslaw and ranch were phenomenal!  It's nice because you can load it up and take as much as you want!"}
{"text":"Fast, Fresh, Tasty, Abundant portions, Clean and Friendly, excellent value!  Where else could I have gotten change from a $10 bill and eaten 6 fish tacos and 2 fountain drinks?  The fish was very tasty and their salsa bar over flowed with home made goodness.  Help yourself to chopped cabbage, cole slaw, assorted peppers, pico di gallo, ranch dressing, avocado dressing, chipotle mayo, tartar sauce, and many bottles of hot sauce.  A great addition to the neighborhood Elliot/Priest."}
{"text":"I had the good fortune of showing up on \"Taco Tuesday\". Got an extra free taco with my two-taco order. That's good news when it's at Tortilla Fish, because these are the best fish tacos I've ever had. I had the \"heart healthy\" steamed Fish Machaca on a soft corn tortilla. (And you do need three of these to fill up.) Friendly, efficient service.  The ambience is what you would expect for a small fast food lunch-type restaurant in a strip mall. Seating for 22 hungry people on a quick lunch break. My second visit so far, and I am going back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious,  authentic Mexican, i am Mexican so I know what I'm talking about. I wish they were close so I don't travel an hour to eat their tacos. My only complain is in the full taco they only give you a tiny shrimp, for that price we should get more shrimp."}
{"text":"Santa Madre Taco Shop has the best shrimp tacos I've ever had! I'm from Chicago and typically go for the steak tacos right away but a guy who was leaving out suggested the shrimp tacos so my dad and I ordered some. I also got a carne asada taco that was very good and a chicken taco. I didn't know which toppings to put on the chicken taco and went with the avocado one. The carne asada meat was very tasty. I just might have to come back one more time before I head back to Illinois for more of the shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"Seriously, the best tacos ever. Staff is so friendly, tacos are so good!"}
{"text":"Really good fish & shrimp tacos.  Quick and easy place to grab a bite.  My kids loved it my hubby loved it that combo for me an A+"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place in the Walmart parking lot. Burritos and tacos.... Fast and fantastic.  If you are heading from Phoenix to Tucson and need a a quick bite this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Visited this location again today with my family for dinner. We were told our fish tacos would be HALF OFF for happy hour!!!!! This was a major plus since their fish tacos are regularly $2.99 each (this was the only snag from my previous review), the service and food was consistent. Our order was made fresh while we waited, the salsa bar was clean, fresh and well stocked. The musice and environment was upbeat and clean, staff was friendly. My family loved the food and I was happy to get a great deal. We definitely came at the right time. :D"}
{"text":"Went to tortilla fish after receiving a coupon... WOW! What a pleasant surprise! The fish and shrimp tacos are amazing, and so is the salsa bar and staff!! Will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"My first visit. Had the $1.99 fish tacos with a side of rice and beans, and a grape Fanta. Delicious food, fast service, low prices. What's not to like? I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love how fresh their seafood is. Huge fan of their governor, which is their shrimp quesadilla. I usually get a head ache from certain batters restaurants use, mainly due to the msg, but theirs is super delicious, and not very oily. They could work on their spend a little, but overall a very wonderful place to eat."}
{"text":"If you like fish tacos, this is the place to go. Went for lunch and got two steamed fish tacos. They were prepared hot and fresh. Not only was the salsa bar comprehensive, the owner walked me through the best flavor pairings. Delish!"}
{"text":"Best shrimp tacos around! They do not skimp on the shrimp whatsoever. The people that work here are super nice and always remember you. I typically show up for Taco Tuesday, buy two get one free. The best part about this place is the toppings bar and let me say they're topping are super fresh and amazing! Best lunch place close to work."}
{"text":"We tried to go on a Sunday afternoon, but this restaurant is closed on Sundays despite the local coupon stating they are open on Sundays from 11 am to 8 pm"}
{"text":"This place sucks! Wtf is this?! A fish Taco that is solely just fish and a tortilla. This place is pathetic, and they wanted $8.99 FOR TWO?!?!  I went back in after eating one of the tacos, and the manager was kind enough to refund me for the two I didn't eat. I bumped up to 3 stars for service.  Tortilla fish should revisit the recipe because the fish, and the presentation of the fish (with obscene large chunks, as a result of no effort in cutting these, that have no choice to fall out or punch through the tortilla), were soggy and flavorless. The tortilla shells were mushy and when I put the salsa on they immediately soaked in the salsa and broke apart at the first bite. I believe that both the fish and tortilla are frozen and packaged because fresh made don't do that.  I understand that they do have a topping bar, but it doesn't matter when the toppings can't fit on the Fish Taco because of the large chunks. The toppings also appear to be canned products based on their taste, and my experience with LA Taco trucks having the same toppings (and nothing is fresh on a Taco truck). I would be shocked if these were prepared fresh.  Because commentors inspired me to elaborate on my experience - In retrospect, I don't think 3 stars is deserving. I would rate 1, but the service was okay."}
{"text":"Wow. What a hidden treasure. Very authentic fish tacos with all the fixings. Hopping busy. Coming back."}
{"text":"This place feels a lot like a Rocky Point joint! They have all the staples you look for in an authentic mexican spot, such as Coke in a glass bottle, and a toppings bar with the squeezable \"guac product\" that I can't get enough of! The fish was fresh, breaded and cooked just right. All the salsas I tried hit the mark. They also have a large patio with a quaint view of the shopping center parking lot. Whatever, RP-level fish tacos and a convenient location make up for any shortcomings."}
{"text":"Just happened upon this place after an exhaustive day of tile shopping. The menu is small but has your basic wants with regards to fish tacos. Basically fish or shrimp or both.   My tacos looked small but wound up being very filling. Even their fries are super tasty. I like the condiment bar with all the sauces and such. Service was fast and friendly. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food is so good! The fish tacos come with large portions of fish and after two, you'll be full. Everything was very fresh when I went during the lunch rush. But like other people have stated it's a very awkward on the inside when you are trying to get sauce or put condiments on your tacos. The line is crazy for the condiment bar there's only one for a ton of customers. You will almost always be awkwardly in someone's way when you're standing around waiting. But besides that the food was fantastic. And the owner was very nice."}
{"text":"This is Fish n Chips with a Mexican flair.  Not sure what all the hype is about, though, if you like Fish n Chips, it's decent.  I just prefer the British version better."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area my whole life and never knew this place existed! Thanks to Yelp I discovered it and had a delicious lunch there!  I went on Taco Tuesday, so I got the 2 for 1 fish tacos (and split a side of fries with my friend), and I couldn't even finish the tacos!!! (Which is saying a lot because I have no small appetite!) The fish is battered with so much flavor and doesn't taste greasy, and each taco is PACKED with the fish! Also, the self-serve topping bar was a major plus too. I love that!  Definitely will be back! If you like fish tacos, you have to try this place! And you can't beat the Taco Tuesday deal."}
{"text":"REALLY...EAT HERE AND EXPAND YOUR PALATTE. No texmex greasy steak fajitas here. Food inspured by fresh light flavors of Sonora. We were seduced by a flier for $5 off $20 or more purchase. This is highly creative chef owns his own place. We had the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, Fish Machaca, and the Gobernador Quesadillas. PRO TIP: These come as double tortillas loaded with meat only. You pile on your own fixens...and the cole slaw on fried fish tacos is divine! Loaded Fish and shrimp tacos were hand breaded and fried in house...NOT some crummy prebattered stuff. They are fresh and crunchy with deep mahogany batter, not crummy frozen panko. Three bucks a taco for fish, $3.50 for big shrimp. Huge..no way I am eating more than two. Machaca is like small succulent chunks of shrimp meat and veggies that had a unique flavor I could not put down. I ate the meat right out of the tortillia keaving the shell intact. It needed no salsa to fill your boca with sabor. Gobernador quesadillia is slightly sweet and creamy (not gooey) cheese with sweet gulf shrimp. It was my favorite and I put delicate tomatillo on it to enhance the sweet, delicate seafood flavor. We missed the Barbacoa...only so much made for the day...means we have to return tomorrow for lunch. Very yummy flavors. Best of show was roasted Jalepenos brined in soy sauce free on the salsa bar. My spouse ate 11 of them and I agreed that I had never had anything like that taste combination. This chef has a franchise explosion just waiting to make him a millionaire. Someone get this guy some angel investors so I can have his tacos at home in Chicago also! Suggestions? Get a be&sco mini press tortillia maker and make tortillias for us. Mmmm. Carve al pastor off a rotating spit for us. Wow...because you are a showman. Your creativity is infectious and I would love to see you turn the average American view of latino food upside down."}
{"text":"The best fish tacos I have ever eaten. Freshly made after you order, and you complete at topping bar thay actually has sauce that is hot.  This is.not where you would expect to get great fish tacos... near Walmart in a little shop part of a strip mall next to \"meh\" national fast food joint in AZ.,"}
{"text":"Freshly cooked fish, steamed veggies, good tasting.  They do need to give double tortillas tho for the fish tacos.  Do that and  put a carbon filter on the water and this place would be gold."}
{"text":"Finally made my way in to try this place...great choice.  Had the fish taco (delicious batter flavor), Carne asada taco (very good overall), and plain quesadilla  (some and good). The salsa, sauces, and extras at the bar were very good. For the first experience, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place definitely satisfied my craving for a fish taco . I love that you can add all the extras on your taco via the condiment bar. The refried beans and rice were ok , I mean how can you mess up refried beans & rice . I used my check-in to get a discount, hey everyone loves discounts . The customer service was good . I'll be back when I have a calorie deficit. You know this kind of food is a moment on the lips - life time on the hips"}
{"text":"I love Tortilla Fish.  Anytime we are in the area we go. I always order too much because I want one of each.  The full taco is my favorite!  The home made ranch with the French fries is also hard to beat."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are exceptional. Best I've ever had!!!  Will definitely go back for Taco Tuesday!!!  Love this place."}
{"text":"I liked the fish and shrimp tacos very much but the tortilla itself is really disappointing. It's the only part of the taco that is sub par. The salsa bar is good not great it has what you expect but falls a little short of expectations.    All in all a solid seafood taco option in the desert for a pretty reasonable price. I'll be back but if the management or ownership happens to see this please upgrade your tortillas we have so many great tortilla options in Arizona."}
{"text":"OK so to be honest the really only thing that SUCKS about this place is that they close way to early for my fish cravings. I have yet to have a bad taco, I have tried different taco's and their Quesadillas and I keep on coming back for more.  SoOoOoO Yummy."}
{"text":"Passing through the area for work and found this gem. Delicious fish tacos - get the \"full\" - favorite one I tried!"}
{"text":"This place is brand new and I was excited to give it a shot since it's right around the corner from where I work.  I ordered two full tacos (fish / shrimp / pepper) for lunch.  They were still installing the security system so they're still figuring things out, based on their website, this is their 1st and only location thus far.  The measures of good corn tortillas for me are: are they fresh and do they fall apart - and these are really good.  The fish and shrimp were fresh and tasty and the cheesy pepper was a nice touch.  The salsa bar is nicely stocked with different salsas / condiments similar to what you'd find in Mexico.  The menu is simple and reasonable - definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish tacos! Def try the \"full\" taco too...it's fried shrimp, fish, and topped with a yellow pepper filled with cheeeeese! Fries were yummy and hubby loved his carne asada burrito. Salsa bar was excellent. I had coleslaw, and hot sauce, hubby had extra hot sauce (lip melting), onion/cilantro and pico. Everything was perfectly cooked and delicious. We will def be back."}
{"text":"UPDATE #2: OK.... I'm really impressed now. The owner responded to my recent update regarding the ventilation system at the restaurant. He assured me that the ventilation system has been fixed. I haven't been back yet, but other coworkers confirmed that there was no lingering odor when they lunched there on Friday. I'm going to give this place four stars again because the owner seems to be a gentleman who cares about his customers and their experience at his restaurant. I will be back on Wednesday for lunch and I'm really looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. The overall theme looks franchised but the food tastes authentic."}
{"text":"Service was great, the place was kept really neat and clean. And the food is authentic. Great place to eat after a hangover or lunch."}
{"text":"I Love Eating at this Place, especially on Taco Tuesday's. Been going here since they were called Tortilla Fish PLEASE TAKE CAUTION!!! If you order two tacos you get the third one free, BUT if you make an order let's say 2 fish and 2 shrimp you should get 1 fish and 1 shrimp free... if you look at your bill they don't bill you that way. They will charge you for the most expensive of the two and give you 2 free of the least expensive of the two. I did ask the lady working the register about it and her response was there's nothing I can do, that just how my register rings it up. So I'm like, I'm actually paying more bc I ordered shrimp and you're charging me for 3 shrimp when Your sign CLEARLY states  buy 2 and get the third taco free. She brushed me off when I told her that the sign is misleading. Anyhow, I've just learned that if I order more than 3 tacos on Tuesday, I need to make 2 different transactions so I don't get charged more on my third taco  Just FYI! Other than that, their Tacos are extremely delicious"}
{"text":"Ordered carne asada 3 tacos and a fish taco. Total $9. They're a lot better than I expected. Tortillas were soft and the meat had good flavor. I didn't think it deviated too much from original tacos from Sonora. Their sauce bar is well stacked and not too watery. But price is not cheap though"}
{"text":"Do yourself and get the Full taco, made 4 tacos out of 2. I believe it had shrimp, fish and yellow pepper with cheese. New fav place and right across the street from work."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos. I appreciate the taco bar that allows customers to dress their tacos as they please. Some here have commented on the fish being in nuggets, but it's only because they chop the fish after it's fried. I watched them do this.   The price point at $3/taco was fair to me as they were very big. I ate two and was satisfied. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Love the fish tacos here. They're so fresh and full of flavor! The fried fish is not heavily battered or greasy. It's light like fish should be! The tartar sauce and cilantro sauce are my faves while the husband ops for the spicy chipotle sauce. The sauces are all pretty good to be honest, I mix it up each time.  We eat here at least once a week - sometimes twice.  Extremely reasonably priced for such high quality. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"My half mexican side comes out (black and mexican) when I eat at this place. we use to go drinking around downtown gilbert then hit up these tacos before they closed they are the best ever. my friends and i really like the salsa bar because they have a lot of salsas to try i recommend this place to anyone who likes authentic mexican fish tacos. i hope they dont americanize it like rubios did."}
{"text":"We had fish tacos here today during happy hour for a dollar 99 each. We were welcome to we came in the door. The tacos were great. The bathroom was clean.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing fish tacos and the shrimp quesadilla thing is to die for! The price is extremely reasonable and you get more than enough food. Plus the staff is super friendly. I'll be sad when I no longer work down the street!"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos ever especially in Arizona and they have a super friendly staff. I love how you can top your own tacos with whatever you want."}
{"text":"I read so many 5 out of 5 stars and I knew I had to try it.  We tried the shrimp taco and fish taco with the fries.  The fries were nice and crunchy and the tacos were fantastic.  I like the condiments bar where we were to able to add an abundant coleslaw, salsa, sauces, lime, etc.  The meal was reasonably priced and definitely a 5 out of 5 stars.  I would highly recommend this place and will make it my weekly place for lunch."}
{"text":"This little place is great!  You order fish, shrimp or chicken tacos and then you dress them up any way you want at the toppings bar!  Very clean, modern & new - we'd eat here once a week if we lived in town!"}
{"text":"A great little place, full taco was awesome and really enjoyed the carne asada.  Lots of salsa/sauce options to go on your tacos."}
{"text":"I can't say this is the best taco shop in our area but I can say the tortillas are probably the best!  I like supporting local businesses so I want to give this a 5 star rating but I can't because I have to be honest since that's what I want from other yelp reviewers (I hate inflated reviews).  The good: flour tortillas, salsa bar, friendly service, good location, the carne asada was delicious, clean bathrooms The not as good: chewy globs in the carne asada (I hate having to filter through my taco before I get to eat it) The bad: they make their beans with LARD and they do not have a black bean/no lard option so side selection is left to just rice."}
{"text":"Amazing fish tacos!  Portions are good sized and very filling. Price is a little more but very worth it!"}
{"text":"Super delicious tacos! These tacos are really good and super big too. I typically only go on Taco Tuesday because it is buy 2 get 1 free and otherwise they're actually kinda pricey. I always get at least one fish and one shrimp which are breaded and never disappoint. I have also had the carne asada (just ok) and the lengua (really good). The topping bar is the best part about this place because they literally have everything you could think of. Recommend trying it, but better if you have a deal or it's Tuesday."}
{"text":"Ambiance...small and not very clean. Very limited menu. Ordered 2 steamed fish and 1 beef tacos on Taco Tuesday (buy 2 get one free) $6.46. They screwed up the order. Seriously, how challenging was it? Didn't even order a drink and it wasn't super busy! They acted like it was a big deal to change it, so we just let it go. The fish was tasty but very greasy.  The beef was very runny and couldn't be eaten like a taco. Wasn't much flavor. More like pot roast. Very disappointed. They didn't have chips. Wanted to give a new place a try. Won't go back. Original Burrito Company or Los Taquitos are both much better."}
{"text":"taco Tuesday or it just to much for lunch, best shrimp and fish taco anywhere near or far really. always friendly staff and clean cooking and salad bar. load up on the cilantro sauce and pile on pico, cabbage, tarter and all the good stuff. i put to much stuff and they will break so i double the tortillas most times. 3 and you are good n its but 2 get one on Tuesday. if shrimp n fish are your thing then what the hell are you waiting for??"}
{"text":"My wife loved her Fish Machaca Taco. I had the Gobernador. But we all agreed that my daughter's Shrimp Tacos were the best!  We liked how many fixin's and dressings they had. You basically dress your own tacos. Great staff too! See their picture on my tips page."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos of all time.  The batter was savory and crunchy, the fish was uber-fresh, and the salsa bar was replete with spicy offerings.  I ordered the \"Full\", which was fried fish and shrimp, along with a cheese-stuffed pepper - for the Lord's sake, just order it.  The next time I am in the Phoenix area, I would be honored to make a return trip."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh fish & shrimp tacos! Go for the Full Taco the cheese stuffed yellow pepper mixed with the fish and shrimp was simple the best seafood taco I have ever eaten. The staff was friendly and quick to make delicious suggestion. Not a huge seating area, but clean and comfortable! Thanks Yelp! Reviewers for a great recommendation... We will making the 15 mile trip for these tacos often!"}
{"text":"Greasy  Everything is fried and nothing grilled  Taste was ok but had no idea there was no option other than fried in the fryer"}
{"text":"Tortilla Fish!! Best Fish Taco place in the valley! And it seems word of this has gotten out, I won't lie most of the time I go, I don't even check in because I wanted to keep this hidden gem to myself, but it doesn't matter anymore, somehow word got out!  The fish tacos are made to order, the fish is fresh and battered and fried, but you never have the greasy fried taste, it's always light and crispy. On Tuesdays, you can order 2 tacos and get the 3rd one free all for under 6 bucks.   I have tied other items but my goto is the fish tacos, just fish and the freshly made tortillas, they have a great salsa bar that you can add your slaw to your tacos, you can spice it up jalapenos, toss in some onions and cilantro and hit with some hot sauce! Hot damn this are some great tacos!  Like I said word has gotten out that this is a great taco shop and if your running short on time, hit up the Eat24 and place your order ahead of time, that's what I do.  Great food, great service and perfect for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I came here one day for some fish tacos and then came back the next for some more. As an Englishman living in Arizona I can get quite deflated by the standard of fish here. Until, i ate at tortilla fish, nice and flakey white fish with a help yourself fresh salad bar. I was very impressed with the food and the friendly staff (goes a long way). I will definitely be coming back. Just when though? Is it normal to have fish tacos three days in a row?"}
{"text":"Really really good fish tacos, I tried the full and it's as close as ur gonna get to Baja in AZ minus the beach!!!"}
{"text":"Any time I go to a Taco shop I always use the carne asada tacos as my metric for how good it is. I was very pleased to find Santa Madre Taco Shop makes amazing carne asada similar to the Baja California style I grew up with in Southern California. We had tacos and a carne asada quesadilla. Both were delicious, hot, and fresh. Many people's aces such as this can have dry meat as it sits after being cooked. Not here. Moist and tender in a way I have only had when the meat was just fresh off the grill. I might of got lucky but it made for terrific food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here with my girls. Great place to eat. Everything is delicious and they actually have a spicy salsa to go on your tacos. Their salsa bar has everything you're going to need for your meal. The kids meals are good portions for the kiddos"}
{"text":"Very tasty fish taco. The full taco w the chile is a bigger size and very flavorful. I recommend getting one of each."}
{"text":"I tried both the shrimp and fish tacos. They were delicious.  Try the chipotle sauce from the salsa bar. It's got a kick to it. I loved the avocado sauce with the shrimp. The only downside is the price. The tacos are about $2.50 each, so if you're a big eater, you might need to bring some extra cash."}
{"text":"Unbelievable fish tacos... Owner on site definitely takes pride in the food.  I like the \"full taco\" best.  Home made sauces are great and salsa bar is always fresh!  This is a great lunch spot and best breaded fish tacos I have had!"}
{"text":"Pros: The food was cooked and served quickly. Plenty of meat in the tacos. They are served plain (just meat and tortilla) and then you get to help yourself to the salsa bar. Out of the 3 tacos I tried (Carne Asada, Surf & Turf, Full) I enjoyed the Carne Asada most. The beef of the Carne Asada taco and the Surf and Turf tacos were well seasoned.  Cons: I'm not a huge fan of the battered layer on the fish and shrimp. However, I will be back for their Carne Asada tacos! Also, the bathroom doesn't have mirrors, but that's besides the point."}
{"text":"Have been hitting up Rubio's for my fish taco fix, but the wife wanted me to try out this place. Lucky I listened to her cause the food was awesome. It's fresh cuts and fried well. The prices are comparable, but the thing that stood out to me was the delicious selection of sauces they provide.  I personally like the Chipotle and avocado sauce. It's unlimited so make sure you don't overload on it :).  Will definitely become a regular at this place."}
{"text":"Where to begin?! First let's start by saying I found this spot on Yelp, so I would like to thank Yelp foremost. Without it, I would have never seen this gem of Tempe. Now to the food. Wow, total deliciousness! Tacos are great, complete with a salsa bar and the variety of sauces they offer. The fish they serve isn't heavily battered where you can taste the cod and moistness of the fish-great! Decent price, where they offer all you can eat fish tacos from 3-6 pm each day. Didn't even know until I checked out there website, so that's always a plus. Went here twice, bringing friends along as they agreed with me as this being a great taco shop. Will most definitely come back again. Satisfied yelper!!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time @ this place and my experience was pretty good. Quite skeptical to try their food but way impressed with my quesadillas and rice and beans."}
{"text":"In love with the full tacos here. Everything is so fresh and tastes great! Also it is priced reasonably and I will be visiting this place again n again :))"}
{"text":"I live near by, went with a friend food was very good food! The lady clerk on night shift was a little arrogant however, as if she own the place, just saying she could have been a little nicer! Food was good! Nice add side bar lost to chose from! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Do not, I repeat, DO NOT listen to the three star review below that states, \"This place sucks! Wtf is this??\"  Well buddy, if you just take a few minutes to understand the whole concept of this restaurant, then you would know what this place is about and it doesn't suck! They serve the taco with meat plain for a reason!! You customize them the way you want with as much or as little jalapeños, onions, salsa, etc you want! It's great and I love it!  Once you add all the toppings you want, that $2.99/taco is a steal - hefty and delicious! They don't even skimp on the meat. Two tacos and some fries were enough for me and the service was really friendly too!  Order and pay at the counter, pick up, dress your tacos, eat it up then head out the door to go on your merry way - It's easy, painless and simple!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The carne asada has a great flavor and the condiment bar is top notch! Multiple types of great tasting taco sauce, cabbage, pickled jalapenos; everything you'd want and more! They also have great avacado and chipotle cream sauces to add to your tacos. I've had lots of Mexican food and as far as street tacos go, this place is as good as it gets; clean, friendly and amazing, reasonably priced food!  Only downside is no liquor license...those tacos would go down even better with a margarita or a Corona!  Awesome job with the place guys - wishing you much future success!"}
{"text":"One word: Fresh. Everything is made to order. Salsa bar is good. Sauces are pretty good. Fish is probably the freshest I've ever had. Zero fish taste very mild. Tuesday is the time to visit because tacos are $2 and huge."}
{"text":"Same kickass flavors and service as the tempe location.  Highly recommended, best shrimp tacos in the biz.  Their fries are great too."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.  Its pretty normal to compare a fish taco shop to places in baja mexico or rocky point, and this place is not as good as those, ITS BETTER!  I go to Rocky point, san felipe, and ensenada a few times per year and Tortilla Fish blows them away.  I tried the fish taco, the shrimp taco and the \"full\" taco.  They were all amazing and the salsa / fixings bar has everything you want and it tastes great.  Now I just hope they open a location closer to my house or work so I can go there all the time."}
{"text":"We just ate at Tortilla Fish today for the first time. All the positive reviews are correct, as it is the best fish taco place in town (and PHX metro for that matter). We tried the steamed fish and the breaded fish and they were both great. The fries were perfect as well. All the condiments are fresh and home made, and the fried jalapenos are super yummy. Our counter person was polite and knowledgeable, and made us feel welcome. We could tell by the steady stream of customers that we found a real gem. Everything is fresh and good and we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the hype is about. I've been looking for decent fish tacos since moving to Tempe from San Diego. I thought this place had to be amazing since it has such great reviews but I was definitely underwhelmed. The fish definitely seems fresh and is made to order so I'll give them that but the service was slow. We were getting our order to go with a baby past his bed time and our food took FOREVER!!! My husband and I each ordered two fish tacos with fries and that's it. I think we must have waited at least 15-20 minutes for our simple order. The fish was soft but I prefer my battered fish tacos to be a little crisp on the outside and I'd say these were almost soggy. Also, you're literally getting fish pieces in a tortilla and that's all. No white sauce, no cabbage, nothing. There's a small salsa bar to add to it but it's not the greatest. Overall, the fish tacos were nothing special and the wait and cost was definitely not worth it. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Bomb. Super fresh and simple. But the toppings bar is out of control. Multiple sauces, salsas, and veggies to go on your tacos. Get all three sauces and load it up with salsa, veggies, slaw, and lime. Fantastic."}
{"text":"This place used to be Tortilla Fish, just with a more expanded menu now as Santa Madre, but still closed on Sundays. This is one of those places that I wish had more locations, just so all the goodness could be shared amongst everyone   Fish Tacos are amazing, like finger-lickin' good. Their Tatar sauce is delicious, along with their ranch and homemade salsa. You cannot go wrong at this place. I will say that the carne asada is delicious too, but I'd pass on the chicken tacos. Everything is made-to-order, so if you are in a hurry- call ahead.   Have never had an issue with service, but the place is small and the parking is crap (sits in the same plaza as Walmart, never to a drive-thru for Panda Express). Would highly recommend happy hour on Taco Tuesdays!! If you love fish tacos, eat here!!"}
{"text":"Awesome fish and shrimp tacos!  The cilantro, chipotle, and creme sauces are on point!  Clean, quick, and delicious!  Just as good as any fish/shrimp taco on the coast."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here, but I am impressed with the flavored. The shrimp taco and the full taco are my favorites. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Excellent, absolutely excellent. What a great meal with he freshest products. First time here and we loved it. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fish and shrimp taco place in Arizona. We wish they would open one of these in Tucson. We can't speak highly enough of the staff and amazing tacos here. They have every kind of sauce you can think of to fill your tacos. I would give more than 5 stars if it were possible."}
{"text":"This is the best fish taco I've ever had. Everything tastes fresh, the salsa bar is more than generous (coleslaw, three salsas, ten hot sauces, poco de gallo, tartar sauce....), and the fish was perfect, not too greasy but not too dry. The taco itself (I got the Full Taco for $3.49) was enormous, and with a side of rice and beans, I don't think I'll be hungry for hours and hours. The staff was attentive but not overbearing. I'm so happy I stumbled upon this place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and never pack my lunch. I had seen Tortilla Fish but never paid much attention because the suite it inhabits seemed like a black hole for previous businesses. Someone brought in a meal from this place and I took a little piece of fish from his plate and it piqued my curiosity.   Later that week I came through to try it out. The first thing I noticed was the clean and tranquil lobby. They like to jam Buena Vista Social Club and Juanes, which isn't too overbearing and plays on the atmosphere well.  I ordered the full taco meal, which include two tacos filled with shrimp, fish, and peppers. I watched them batter the shrimp and fish and was already stoked to inhale my meal. Additionally, they have a salsa bar and there are more than a number of combinations.   Long story short, the tacos were tight and the fries were addicting (add lime!). I will definitely be back and I hope they continue to keep serving their meals at the bar they have set for themselves."}
{"text":"Fantastic little taco shop!!! Always love whatever I get here!!! Hands down BEST fish tacos in town!!!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this new place on Yelp and stopped in for what turned out to be a gourmet taco experience!!  We had a fish taco (so moist), shrimp taco and carne asada taco...they were all so delicious and flavorful!  They have a full salsa and condiment bar to add to your liking too! The fries are deep fried with a light batter and we couldn't stop eating them  But, when I put a fork full of refried beans into my mouth, I swear I shed a tear...they are so authentic and delicious I just wanted more when they were gone...good thing I had absolutely no room left in my belly. We will be back"}
{"text":"I am a first timer and just had an excellent meal. Ordered the Surf & Turf and am impressed. Will definitely return. FYI - Extra Hot Sauce at the sidebar is no joke (spicy)."}
{"text":"Best tacos around town and the fries are awesome too. Great salsa bar with must try chipotle and cilantro  sour cream . Only bad thing is the area. Located in the Walmart parking lot brings in some sketchy looking people. But you absolutely have to try this place the food is phenomenal."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for fish tacos. The boyfriend and I went here for lunch and each ordered one fish and one shrimp taco. When you get them, they are plain - just the fish or shrimp. But then you head over to the salsa bar and add the topping that you want.   I added the slaw to both and got a few sauces to try on the side - avocado, chipotle and cilantro. They also have different salsas, ranch, tartar sauce hot sauce, limes, and more so you can really customize your tacos.  The slaw was fresh and crispy. All the sauces I tried were good but my favorite sauce was the cilantro. It was creamy and not overpowering.  The tacos are pretty big, bigger than street tacos. Two were enough for me, boyfriend did go back for a third.  Both the shrimp and the fish were really good and I love that you can add the toppings that you want. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the battered fish, and fish machaca tacos with a quesodilla and fries. Everything had such amazing flavor for a very reasonable price. The salsa bar adds endless possibilities of customization. If you thought you liked Rubio's you'll love Tortilla Fish."}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos are really good here. They've got a good salad bar too! You can customize your taco."}
{"text":"Authentic Sonoran Taste! Taco fish is centrally located, offers a well packed salsa bar, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious. A must try."}
{"text":"Congrats to Francisco on this new location! I'll update this as soon as I can, but suffice to say these guys understand what makes great Baja-style Mexican food! If you're carb-conscious, be sure to try your fish tacos \"naked style\" (no tortilla)."}
{"text":"After visiting TF pretty much every week, I decided it's time to update my review. Bottom line: I love this place! Make no mistake, it's a fast food restaurant in a strip mall, opposite WalMart. But remember the old sage, you can't judge a book by its cover. Same goes here! The place is clean and uncluttered, and the staff is ALWAYS very friendly and helpful.  But the food! Always fresh, made to order, and very tasty! I always order two tacos (and get one free on Tuesdays ) -- naked style, which means no tortilla. Then customize to my liking at the excellent salsa bar. Amazing flavor combinations are possible! Be sure to try the chipotle and the cilantro sauces.  Check out my photos for many examples of what can be created. Today I decided to avoid the fried choices, and went with two Fish Machaca tacos - naked style, of course!"}
{"text":"What a surprise!  We needed a quick lunch and spotted this cafe. It's quaint - seats about 20. Counter service. Lots of choices for tacos and burritos.    We tried the combo specials - I had the fish tacos with fries and the hubby had the carne asada.  Both were good, but the fish tacos were amazing! Big crispy and flavorful.    I love the salsa and condiment bar.  If I have one suggestion it would be to move it to the middle of the room so both sides could be accessed. Where it is now only 1 person at a time can use it so it creates a bottleneck.   We will be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Stopped by with the wife on Friday,and PaPow.Very clean inside and the freshness of the food was incredible.Forget Rubios folks,this place rocks."}
{"text":"The absolute BEST fish taco I've ever put in my mouth PERIOD!!!!  I would drive by 20 places that sell fish tacos to get to these.  Your search ends here."}
{"text":"First time today really love the quesadilla shrimp it is not fried. Diet coke was great but coke was not.  It's Tuesday but two get one free including the quesadilla. So they had no chicken I will go back and try and edit review if need.  The fried shrimp taco was good I just don't love fried food. I will stick with the shrimp quesadilla which is not fried. I can see why this place has such great reviews"}
{"text":"Okay fellow Yelpers, I'm not quite sure what went wrong but this is the first time you've steered me wrong.  We were craving fish tacos and were expecting a great meal but were sadly disappointed.  Maybe growing in SoCal ruined any chance of finding great fish tacos anywhere else...I don't know.  First of all, I'm really not a huge fan of these new \"do it yourself\" or \"have it your way\" type restaurants.  I feel like there is no creativity at all and I really want to be wowed when I go out to eat.  On that note, I get the concept and if I do end up at this type of place, I would expect that whatever I choose should blow me away because it's exactly how I chose to make it, right? Unfortunately, it seldom turns out that way and Tortilla Fish was no exception.  Absolutely ZERO flavor.  And this was with several different types of condiments. I would normally think that maybe my taste buds were off or something, but the husband and the daughter felt the same way.  We were all disappointed.  I suppose I should've known when they don't display the type of fish used on the menu that it was a mistake but I had hope.  I ordered both the fish taco and the fish machaca taco.  The fried fish was cooked well but as I said, no flavor.  And the fish machaca taco was mushy and just not good.  The hubby had two fish tacos and felt the same. The daughter had the shrimp quesadilla and that fell short for her as well.  The best part of our meal were the beer battered fries.  They were delicious and the reason for the two stars.  In addition to the poor food was relatively poor service and atmosphere.  The cashier did his job but the cooks behind him seemed grumpy and didn't even include our daughter's quesadilla with our order.  We had to ask for it so he quickly threw it together and recalled our number.  No apology or anything.  The restaurant is also very small and cramped, which would be fine except that it is also really unorganized with people standing everywhere and not really knowing where to form a line so they are basically standing over people as they eat.  Very awkward.  Overall, not a great experience and I definitely won't be returning.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"It was okay. Nothing to write home about; it was hot, the breaking was what I mostly tasted. Would I eat there again? Yes. It's not my go to destination, but would dine there again. I'm not trying to discourage anyone from trying, it's just happens not to be my go to!"}
{"text":"Loved this fish tacos! They fill their tacos with a great portion of fish. All the sauces are amazing and the mild salsa was very tasty. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! What else needs to be said. Highly recommend that you try this place. I haven't found fish tacos in Arizona better than this."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are really good.  It's just a shame this place is in a Wal-Mart parking lot because the riff raff like to eat here.  On our visit one guy was in handcuffs detained by the police outside (for a non-fish taco related incident) and there were about 20 people crowded around the few tables waiting for someone to leave so they could sit.  Those fish tacos are solid though."}
{"text":"Meh. The fish was flavorless and the barbacoa was burned. The restaurant doesn't offer sour cream. Instead, they provide mayonnaise and ranch. I personally find the thought of those items on a taco disgusting."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp!  Great call on this little hole in the wall. I hit Tortilla Fish Tacos on \"taco Tuesday\" and had three of the best \"fast food\" fish tacos ever. I asked the manager what kind of fish they use and he told me it was Alaskan pollack. Very tasty."}
{"text":"By far best fish tacos I have eaten!   Definitely recommend the full tacos - mixture of fish and shrimp."}
{"text":"The food was good! I was a little bummed that I had a buy one get one coupon & he wouldn't honor it. He gave me a \"free taco\" my coupon said buy one menu item get another free but apparently he didn't couldn't honor it. Whatever. It's lent so it'll be a good place to buy lunch on a busy Friday!"}
{"text":"There were not alot of people in the restaurant when we arrived at 645 on a Saturday so we were skeptical. Don't let that be a factor because you'll miss out. Tacos are great!  You add your toppings which are also very tasty and you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"YUM! So glad I made the decision to give this place a try.  Tasty, satisfying, fresh, reasonably priced, and a couple of really great guys behind the counter.  Theses two are providing guidance and info about the food, directing to the best place for menu viewing, taking the orders, and cooking it up to order. Did I say FRESH?  The fish was fresh and tasty and the light batter was very complimentary, not a lot of fluffy filler.   The salsa/condiment bar was far from what you might typically see (Baja Fresh, America's Taco Shop, etc.).  Not to say anything bad about any of those but this one is just different.  Loved the cilantro sauce and the hot habanero salsa.  You can choose between chopped cabbage or a (dry) slaw as one of your toppings too.  But really, what's a fish taco without cabbage?   And let me tell you, their version of tartar sauce is not what you might expect either -creamy, light, refreshing compliment to the fish.  Wish I could just order the first alone just so I could enjoy some of their tartar sauce with.  They also have a hot oil.   Interesting.   I went with the Full and and one other.  Forgot to get pics cuz i was hungry and anxious to try these.  My son had the Gobernador and Campechana.  I tasted his quesadilla and give it two thumbs up.  We were very satisfied with our choices and glad we decided on this place for lunch. We will be back."}
{"text":"OMG food made with love, fresh at reasonable prices YUM!  We had the fish tacos and shrimp quesadilla you pick your toppings from a little area, pico sauces slaw delicious!"}
{"text":"I would love to get this place five stars however the price and the quality of fish does not allow me too. The tacos them selves are good and the fish isn't bad however there's something lacking in the flavor. The Fixin's bar helps add some kick to the flavor with salsas and toppings."}
{"text":"We had the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, rice&beans, French fries and salsas. Everything was delicious and not over powering.  The portion was spot on."}
{"text":"We love Tortilla Fish! We went tonight for the first time at this location for the free taco opening night! As expected, the fish tacos were awesome, the French fries were perfect and everything from the salsa bar was excellent! There are so many toppings, salsas and sauces to try at the salsa bar! Fast, cheap, amazing food! Looking forward to coming back to try the new carne asada!"}
{"text":"Now I know where to go when I want a good fish taco. The Governador was ok, the tortilla could have been warmed more... French fries were crispy and good."}
{"text":"love this place. this review is based on my second time there. i got 2 fish tacos, 1 shrimp taco, fries, and a drink. the tacos were AMAZING and the salsa bar has a lot of variety. fries were nice and crisp, like beer batterd fries"}
{"text":"My friends enjoyed their tacos and I did, sort of. The medium heat salsa was so hot that I couldn't enjoy my meal. Couldn't even finish the second carne taco. The battered fish taco was really good until the heat kicked in.  The refried beans were good but also had a kick to them.  I'll try again but without salsa. Can't imagine what the Hot salsa would do to me. Yikes!!"}
{"text":"this is the best fish taco ever. i enjoyed every piece of it fresh flavorful. the fries, rice, and beans are all good too. great customer service and can't beat the price will definitely come back"}
{"text":"My experience wasn't bad, just not up to the hype of all the other reviews. I tried the shrimp, fish, campechana and machaca tacos. The shrimp tacos were the best and the little station filled with fresh toppings was great. It was a bummer that my machaca tacos had a lot of little bones in it, and the horchata drink tasted powdery and sour. I also came at a time when the restaurant wasn't busy, but the floor and some tables were dirty. The smell of fried food also lingered in my hair and clothes when I left lol! Again, the experience wasn't bad, but I don't think I will visit again...I still prefer Americas Taco Shop."}
{"text":"These may be the best fish tacos I've ever had  we go with The Full and the Machaca. Cilantro, chipotle, and avacado in the Full and the spicy sesame oil on the Machacas.  If you like fish tacos you cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"Is it weird that my very favorite thing at a taco shop is their fries? Seriously, some of the best damn french fries I've ever had are from Tortilla Fish. Also, the tacos are good. Fish fried in peanut oil sounds weird, but the result is amazing. I love the taco bar to build you own tacos with perfect amounts of condiments and the pricing is decent. I just wish that they served booze - a margarita would be perfect with my taco and fries."}
{"text":"I loved it! My first time here I was kind of nervous, however I fell in love at first bite. The fish and shrimp are so crunchy and I love all the toppings they have in the bar. I didn't have the french fries but they looked like heaven so I will definitely go back with some friends to try them! :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful and refreshing to find such good good north of the border - normally I need to be in Cabo or Rocky point to get such good fish and shrimp tacos - not anymore.  Service was great and helpful with recommendations for the salsa bar pairings - enjoyed to the shrimp corn quesadilla and a couple of full tacos - light breaking flaky and moist fish - a lite cabbage slaw with a bit of their tartar to finish it off - fantastic!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tortilla Fish is phenomenal! This is a healthy substitute to your average Subway sandwich.... But three times better! They offer steamed vegetables and grilled fish for the real health freaks like me. The interior is a fresh blue, with beautiful photography of Mexican shores. They provide quick service, excellent staff, and warm smiles! I highly recommend stopping in here to taste real, authentic fresh fish with natural ingredients! Treat your body & life to some limes, cilantro & spice!"}
{"text":"Fish is Alaskan Pollack and fried in a rice oil so they are not greasy at all!  They have a great season stand with cabbage and all of the fixings. A variety of sauces but must tries are their cilantro and homemade ranch from scratch with veggies and all. Small place to sit 20-30 but I will definitely put this one on my frequent list. A great Lenten Season option too!"}
{"text":"Wow did this place live up to the Yelp hype!   If you're a fan of Rubios Fish Tacos ... I'm gonna have to ask you to RUN to Tortilla Fish.  There's a new sheriff in town, and they kick the chains asses with both hands tied behind their back!   Last week, I had an hour before I had to do my Phoenix-Southern AZ work commute and Dude had a day off work... So we decided it was time to finally try this place.  It wasn't too busy at 11. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by who I assume to be Francisco P. Super clean, even their restrooms.  I ordered the Full and Shrimp Tacos, Dude ordered two Shrimp Tacos. And we also split an order of beer battered fries. The free large drink Yelp check-in offer was a nice bonus!  The toppings and sauce bar was phenom. I tried the hot salsa on one, cilantro sauce on another, and added some shredded cabbage. We also got a side of ranch. Glad I stuck to the hot though; unlike other restaurants Tortilla Fish doesn't lie about spice levels.   Another friendly employee also told us they make all sauces in house daily. So good! Also, they don't cook anything til it's ordered.  I really enjoyed both of my tacos. The corn tortillas were incredibly fresh.   Yes, they fry the fish here but it was flaky, light and not bogged down with greasiness. The cheesy pepper in the Full Taco was sinfully delicious: Take a bite, and it melts everywhere.   Also, the ranch complimented the fries perfectly.   A lot of food for two people; if you drop in by yourself definitely stick to two tacos as the fry portion is huge.   Overall, great experience, amazing food with a side of stellar customer service.   We wish they were open later on the weekends.   Welcome to the neighborhood, Tortilla Fish. I anticipate returning many times and hope y'all stick around for a long time!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome ! Another hole in the wall place run by passionate people serving amazing quality food. Fish, shrimp , chicken , beef and stemmed fish tried it all. Saved on warm fresh soft  locally made corn tortillas. The condiments cart is a unique idea making itself serve to create your own flavors. Great find while traveling. Local gem , must try ."}
{"text":"It's noon, so lunch rush... I get it. I ordered \"combo 2\" (2 tacos, fries and a soft drink). I was quoted 10 min but actual service time was 15 min. If you ask me, that's a bit long for fried fish and shrimp on plain tortillas where you take them to the salad bar and build them yourself. The cilantro mayo is a winner though! Yummm  It would be handy if the tables were re-positioned, especially during lunch, where a lot of individuals are coming in to order. There was no seating available, so if you are one of the many waiting for your order, you will likely feel yourself in the way and awkwardly looming over the shoulders of those seated and eating.   The food is tasty, but the flow of things needs a little work. Overall, I would definitely go back. I'd say it is a good value for the price. The creative twist to the sauces, slaw and salsa really make the tacos unique. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"My Wife and I love Tortilla Fish! The best fish tacos in AZ. They always give big pieces of fish on the tacos. Plus the Chipotle salsa is bomb."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after seeing all the positive reviews and I'm glad I did. Super fresh shrimp and fish tacos made to order, an amazing assortment of daily-made sauces and salsas, incredibly engaging owners and employees, and a nice clean dining experience. Seemed odd to me that they'd offer French fries instead of tortilla chips but I certainly can't complain-- the fries were outstanding, gold and crispy on the outside and downy soft on the inside. Try them with the house made ranch dressing! My husband is a salsa hound so he fell in love with the extensive salsa bar. He eats habanero peppers raw, too, so when he told me that the extra hot salsa was HOT, I believed him.  Thanks, Yelp, for letting me know about this place. I love supporting local restaurants that are trying hard and doing a great job. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The name rings true. They serve fish in tortillas :) The menu is limited to mainly tacos and quesadillas and you can have your fish in various ways: fried, marinated, combined with shrimp, etc. For those that aren't in a seafood mood they do offer chicken and barbacoa. I had a fish machaca taco and a campechano taco. Both were around $3-4 each. I was initially confused because I associate the word machaca with shredded marinated beef. I then found out that machaca is also a type of Central American fish. Anyways, the machaca was flavorful with a citrus-y kick. The campechano taco had battered and fried shrimp and fish. The batter was light and tasted crisp against the tender texture of the fish. The shrimp were very slightly tough though. The name shouldn't be confused with campechana, a cold seafood dish in a tomato-based sauce (I did have some confusion there until I realized it was a different name. Basically there was a lot of word confusion going on in my head today : ) ).  The condiment/salsa bar has a myriad of options for your taco. Tartar sauce, shredded cabbage, various heat levels of salsa, and limes are just a few of the sides available. The very hot salsa is aptly named and definitely packs a punch!  The tacos have a soft corn tortilla shell, double layered and steamed. While they were decent as a vehicle to hold the meat inside, a little grilling would help add some texture and added flavor to the taco.  I came here around 12:30 and there were no seats left in the restaurant. I was originally intending to eat here but I decided to get my order to go since there was nowhere for me to actually sit and eat my tacos. They do have some limited seating outside, but it was a little too cold for me to feel comfortable eating outside for lunch.  Overall, it was an enjoyable meal. Maybe I'll stop by here again to dine in when it's not as busy."}
{"text":"The quesadilla  and tacos were delicious. The tartar sauce and chipotle sauce made them even better!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  First and foremost, the food as delicious and I always enjoy it.  Service is awesome too - months back I placed and paid for an order and left to run an errand while it was being prepared.  Unfortunately, in the time it took for me to return, some kind of police situation had occurred in a neighboring business and I was unable to get my food.  The staff (who were outside due to the situation) promised to comp me for my meal on a future date.  I wasn't able to come in for a few weeks, but when I did, they honored their word and fulfilled my order.  They really didn't have to this since the police situation wasn't their fault to begin with, and the fact that they remembered after such a long time was very cool."}
{"text":"By far the best fish & shrimp tacos!!! Takes a little while to make but well worth it. The salsa bar is fresh and amazing."}
{"text":"I can't even think of where to start. I love this place and love that there are two locations now. One by my house and one by my work! I always get the fish and shrimp tacos, typically two will fill me up but if I'm super hungry I will get three. They also have a Campechano (mixed) taco that comes with both fish and shrimp and that is melt-in-you-mouth good too! The tacos are great size and they don't hold back on the filling!!! I love how they give you the tacos naked (with just the fish/shrimp) and you can add all of the salsa, and toppings you want! Don't let the shopping mall exterior scare you off, this is a diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"Just had the best battered fish tacos here, that I have ever tasted in my life, including anywhere I've tried in Hawaii or Southern California.  Fresh and hot, incredibly tender, fantastic flavor, light batter, just incredible.  Oh, and each $2.99 taco is absolutely loaded with fish, to the point that you can barely close the tortilla.  There is also a very nice selection of sauces, salsas, slaw etc at the fixins bar.  This is a small, strip mall located , order at the counter, plastic utensils and plates type of setup.  Very clean inside.  It's only 11:05 a.m. and the place is already 2/3 full, so that should tell you something.  Can't say enough about the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh and delightful. Order two of the tacos and fries and you are guaranteed to be satisfied. You can not go wrong with this taco shop."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I love fish tacos and try them everywhere. This place batters and frys the fish as you order it and gives a very generous amount of fish one each taco. The best part is the topping bar where you get to choose what goes on your taco! Sauces are made in house and there are a variety of hit sauces to pick from also. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the best shrimp tacos I have had in awhile, friendly service as well, the best day is taco Tuesday buy one get one free"}
{"text":"Found the best fish tacos ever in Tempe AZ. This place was excellent and I have been eating fish tacos all over the world."}
{"text":"We really loved this place! Fresh hot fish tacos, excellent beer battered fries, and a wonderful salsa bar with different salsas and cream based sauces like avocado, chipotle, and cilantro. They also make their own ranch for their fries. The one thing I wish they did was offer flour tortillas instead of just corn; start offering the flour tortillas and it'd be a 5 star from me! Other than that this place was fantastic and we'd definitely be back. Also the staff and owner is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Came for buy two get one free and it was awesome! I never had a great tortilla fish for a long time. I came twice to checked the consistency of the flavors and it still the same and awesome services. I would like to recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Thanks again yelp for this gem! Being out of state is hard to come by great food. Thanks to reviews i decided to back track my commute and check it out.   Combo #1- 2 tacos, fries and a drink.  My tacos were campechana (mixed fish and shrimp). The fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly.  I might say they are the best fries I've ever had!  Omg one of the BEST tacos (fish/shrimp) i have EVER had. The fish and shrimp were deliciously battered and chopped in pieces. The fixings were the best especially mixing the chipotle, cilantro and avocado sauce.  Wow, so good!!! Ok, i need to stop reviewimg and eat. My tummy is happy!!!"}
{"text":"There carne asada is the bomb. Spanish rice FTW! You need this in your life honestly, the only thing missing is al pastor and that's not on the menu!"}
{"text":"Good flavor. Good prices. Definitely worth ten minutes if you are in the area. Very low key."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant. I like to come in on Taco Tuesdays. I order their full tacos and a governor.  The best and freshest tacos, buy 2 and get the 3rd FREE.... always great shrimp and fish tacos, friendly and great atmosphere. Great deal :)."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Best fish tacos I've had in Arizona and in my top 5 overall. Delicious batter that's crispy but not heavy if that makes sense and a very distinct flavor.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service. Everything on the menu is excellent. Try the avocado and/or cilantro sauce. Great salsa bar."}
{"text":"Listen up, this is a huge tip I am going to pass on to you because normally I would selfishly keep something like this to myself but since I hardly ever am in this part of town it's not very likely I'll be able to go to Santa Madre much.  People, this place has the best tortillas ever.  Better than homemade ones I've had recently, and even better than - dare I say - Carolina's.  I just ordered an ordinary burro, but with the first bite I was immediately taken back to my childhood and that freshly made tortilla rolled up with a paper towel, butter running down my forearm.    Really sorry I can't tell you more about the other food, the service or even the ambiance.  The tortilla obliterated all else.  Santa Madre is in a strip center on the North side of the road in the WalMart parking lot, just directly South of the WalMart.  You're welcome :)"}
{"text":"Going up, on a Tuesday! Taco Tuesday's here to be exact, but two items get one free, such an amazing deal! So yeah, they fried fish tacos are delicious, they come on a flour tortilla and you have an enormous selection of salsas and amazing slaw and other vegetables. Will update again on my fourth visit :)"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos. Always fresh. Right price. Fixings bar & sauces are great garnishes. Build your own taco to fit your taste. Yummo! Phx/Thomas Rd. shop has a small outdoor patio to enjoy."}
{"text":"You have to get the full tacos or governor.  The horchata was just OK.  The Yelp deal will get you a free large drink.  The salsa bar has some tasty choices. (Avocado sauce, chipotle,  pico de gallo, limes, and other choices as well.)"}
{"text":"This taco place is a hidden gem for sure .. on the side of the Target shopping center next to GNC ..  Perfect for a work week lunch .. I've had all the fish and shrimp tacos on the menu .. all perfectly prepared.. the beer battered fish & shrimp are my favs.. they serve them plain and you load them up from the salsa /fixings bar.   The french fries are always crispy and the rice & beans are tasty.  They do have other items on the menu .. like carne asada tacos..   Try the unsweetened watermelon ice tea.. yum.. refreshing!!   They have a second location in Tempe closer to home, but I like this one better!!"}
{"text":"This place serves excellent shrimp and fish tacos. It's a great value on Tuesdays, when you buy 2 and get 1 free. 3 tacos is a lot to eat here. They serve you the taco without the condiments. You go to the condiment bar, and add your own. They have onions, chili peppers, multiple salsa choices, cilantro, and more."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Very bland tacos and salsas."}
{"text":"Recently moved to CT so was in desperate need of some authentic Mexican food. This place had great tacos made even better by the handmade tortillas. I sadly go back to CT today, but will definitely come here again next time I'm in town and will highly recommend this place to all my friends and family that live in the greater Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and truly made-to-order. Have you ever had a taco with piping hot fish and shrimp topped with cold poco de gallo, cabbage and creamy chipotle sauce? No? Well go to tortilla fish and come back to this review after you have experienced that first bite from Tortilla Fish. Yummm!"}
{"text":"The best restaurant I've ever been in Phoenix Arizona I hope they make one on the west valley"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place truly serves great fresh food at amazing prices...I  had the Governor which is awesome and flavorful and the steamed fish taco which was delicious as well.  I plan on being a regular here!!"}
{"text":"I was traveling on business and looking for a quick hitter. My Yelp review led me here. It was close to my hotel. I had the full taco and a fish taco. Very nice portion and the food was good. They have a salsa bar with lots to choose from plenty bottles of different hot sauces.  Good food and nice service."}
{"text":"Fish tacos and fries... a simple go together like menudo and a hangover. The fish is flaky tasty battered and delicious.  The fries aee as good as any and better than most the condiments are delicious.. the cilantro sauce pars well with the fish tacos and slaw stuff.   The tartar sauce reminds me of tzatziki.. it is way better than plain ol tartar..   Thus place is pretty tasty for a simple staple place."}
{"text":"I thought I knew what great fish tacos were until I ate here! I'm visiting from Colorado for the week and will stop in more then once! Fish tacos, amazing!"}
{"text":"excellent! I love their tacos and salsa bar! The food is really fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after a full day of volleyball tourneys. Yup there's Walmart.. Lol.....We decided on the fish tacos per my Yelp fams recommendation. We got the fried fish tacos which were actually really good. I was worried they would be super greasy but they were not. The fish was tender and flavorful. We grabbed a bunch of the sauces and salsas. My favorite tho was the grilled jalapeños marinated in soy sauce. I knowwww......sounds odd right but they were oh so delicious...like super delicious and the jalapeños were full of flavor!  I cut them up and put them in the fish.. Yummmmm. We also went with the bottled strawberry Fanta (from Mexico) that Fanta is always the best.   So all in all good food and a place we will definitely do a repeat of in the future."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are awesome! Love the idea of a build your own taco! Batter is light along with the seasoning on the fish!"}
{"text":"Went here today got 3 carne asada tacos w rice & beans. Not really a fan of the rice or beans but they were edible and I was hungry. The tacos were perfect though! They have a salsa bar & make your tacos plain so you can make them how you want! So all in all I had a great experience! Visiting from Indiana, we don't have taco places like these. I usually have to go to an authentic Mexican restaurant and sit down to eat for GOOD tacos, so the fact that I was able to grab & go just made it that much better!!"}
{"text":"IOne of my co workers loves this place and decided to bring us some tacos. This has to be one of the best fish/shrimp tacos I ever eaten. I will defiantly be visiting this place in the near future."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for fish tacos now for a couple of reasons. One is that everything seems so fresh, and the other is that despite my initial impression that the tacos are small, I always leave here full and satisfied. Honestly, the thing I cannot get over is the condiment bar. It is kept chilled and offers all manner of extra taco fillings... fresh salsas, chopped cabbage, limes, peppers, and the squeeze bottles of creamy sauces. I cannot discern what makes the Ranch Dressing here taste a hundredfold better than any other. Is it real buttermilk? Is it whipped up fresh every day? Do they add extra garlic or spices? I can't place it but it is phenomenal.  The other striking thing about Tortilla Fish is that I can no longer eat fish tacos without french fries. Their fries are absolute heaven when you pair them with my own concoction of fry sauce: It's half ketchup and half creamy chipotle dressing. Like their Ranch, the Creamy Chipotle is second-to-none. And the fish taco options keep growing every time I visit. On my most recent pilgrimage, I tried the \"full taco\" (fish, shrimp, and a cheese-filled yellow hot pepper) and the \"fish machaca taco\" (steamed and shredded seasoned fish). Both were excellent.  I'll admit it. I'm addicted to these fish tacos and fries. And there is no rehab for me, simply more repeat trips to my favorite fish-taco craving destination."}
{"text":"I must say this is the first taco spot I've been to where you can order tacos and then apply the toppings yourself. I love the fact that I can us as much or as little of anything and make crazy combinations. The meat portions are sized well and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp this time, I the fish was pretty good on my previous visit.  The shrimp was terrific!  One great feature of this restaurant is that you can put what you want on the tacos at the condiment bar. If you love lots of cabbage and onions (which I do), you can load up your tacos till your heart's content. The horchata was okay, I would have preferred less sugar and more cinnamon and nutmeg. They have coke made in Mexico (they still use real sugar there) which is the best! The menu is somewhat limited, but worth a visit.  BTW - the 3 for 2 Taco Tuesday is a GREAT bargain!!!"}
{"text":"Sadly, it's time to update my review...downwards.    Got lunch here today and ordered the combo #2, which consisted of a small drink, one fish taco and shrimp salad that was a lot bigger than what I was expecting.  I was thinking it was side salad sized, not entrée sized.  (I also thought all of the lunch combos came with 2 tacos, not just one.  *sigh*)  As far as the food goes, the fish taco was great, but the shrimp on the salad tasted *suspicious* so I tossed the whole salad out after a couple of bites rather than risk it.  I may still regret those bites that I took.  That remains to be seen...  The whole meal set me back over $9 and really all I got to eat was one fish taco and small lemonade.  Not so much with the value, eh?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   food was delicious and the concept of me garnishing my tacos by myself with all the condiments that i chose was great.  The staff there was very cool and helpful. This is the only place I've ever checked in and liked on Facebook that took the time to like my status of me liking them!!!  lol  new to Phoenix but this is defenetly one of my new joints you can find me at."}
{"text":"The tacos here are incredible!!  Everything is made from scratch, they have a beautiful condiment bar, and who knew you could make machaca from fish??  Who cares because it's delish!!!"}
{"text":"Second time I've been here and it's amazing! Great fish tacos, but their carne asada is awesome too!! Try some of everything. I'm going after the carne asada fries next."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Been here a few times and comparing it to all the fish tacos out there, can't give it a 4.  This is good, not great.  Not bad at all, just not phenomenal.    Major plus for having the creativity to carry a fish machaca taco.  A major negative from this last trip - got my throat stuck with a bone.  Some people would give 0-2 stars for this, this isn't that kind of place and I'm not that kind of reviewer.  But this pace can do better, and picking out all the bones should be a baseline for quality.  Also, with how wet it is and how much they give, it could use 2 tortillas.  It's not really Baja-style here.  Fried fish tacos in Baja were adapted from Japanese immigrants to the area using tempura-style batter.  Light, crispy.  The coating here is thin with some crispness but not the same as tempura-style.  Again, it's not bad, it's just not traditional Baja.  Also, it's more like a make-your-own taco here, with all the condiments on the side including the cabbage, onions, cremas, and salsas.  Great if you are picky about what goes into your taco, but I'd be interested to see what the kitchen would do if they composed the entire taco.  So not bad, not great.  Value is good for the volume, but compared to the best fish tacos I've had, gotta stick to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Not in my side of town, but really good!! Friendly staff, fresh ingredients and everything we ate was delicious! Had the steamed fish taco and the shrimp quesadilla.  Highly recommended and we will be back again!"}
{"text":"Fish shrimp beef... they have it all, even French fries. My mom says you may not be impressed with the restaurant but you'll love the tacos. She was right!!"}
{"text":"Modern and clean. Dress your own tacos at the condiment bar. I had the avocado sauce and something else...weren't labeled, but delicious none the less. Fish was fresh a little over breaded but crispy and delicious as well. Price point is good tacos are good. Support local this place is worth it."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were some of the best I've ever had. So light and crunchy! The homemade salsas were fantastic. Not much seating options but not a problem at all if you're taking it to go. Would highly recommend a visit here!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were pretty decent. Only problem I had was when you do take out, it's kinda pain in the arse to get all those toppings/sides in little tiny containers. I wish they would have them pre-packed or carry takeout boxes with little compartments for sides."}
{"text":"Really loved this place. I had a fish, shrimp and Carne Asada taco. They make the taco with just meat and the tortilla and let you add all the fixings from their salsa bar which was awesome. Each taco came with enough meat for me to make two tacos if I wanted! I'll be back for sure, just wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST fish tacos in the valley! They only have one location but its worth the trip! The battered fish tacos are crispy, not soggy and not too much breading. You get to top it off with their awesome salsa bar full of fresh limes, cabbage, cilantro dressing, chipolte, or avocado sauce! their grilled taco is also delish, a must try!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best fish tacos I've ever had. I am really looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Good cheap tacos their topping bar is amazing with so many fresh veggie choices and sauces to load up the taco. I love the shrimp tacos they are nice and crispy and not super chewy and staff is very friendly as well"}
{"text":"Great place for taco Tuesdays. The tacos are huge and they provide a free condiment bar with great salsas and sauces."}
{"text":"The fish taco was awesome the shrimp was average at least for me, fish taco was plump and juicy, you can pile up some heathy veggies and the tarter sauce bumped it up! If I'm craving a fish taco this is my new spot Fo sure"}
{"text":"Everything here is good. At the Tempe location I would get the fish and fries combo, but the carne asada fries might have won me over here. Speaking of the fries, they are some of the best in Phoenix. The salsa bar is really where it's at, lots of options and the sauces (ranch, cilantro, chipotle options) all really stand out."}
{"text":"I love the salsa bar and for fish tacos you really can't get any better in the area. Prices are reasonable as well and they seem to have a lot of deals like half price tacos during certain times etc.  Oh... and the fries with the chipotle sauce is such an addicting combo. Some of the best fries in town."}
{"text":"Now that is what a fish taco should taste like.  I tried the full taco, the shrimp taco, and the machaca taco and they were all great. I will definitely be getting the shrimp again and again. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The corn tortillas had a mild flavor and held up well to sauces.   The hot salsa wasn't joking, go easy on it the first time even if you are a spice lover like me.  There were plenty of condiment choices, from the traditional pico de gallo to  worcheschire and tarter sauce. Something for everyone.  This place looks modern and clean.  It has really comfortable chairs, believe it or not. Plus, the staff is really nice. I recommend going on Tuesday for their 3 for 2 taco special. I'm full and my wallet thanked me."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place could be any better. The people there are always really chill and welcoming. Food is always the same: FRESH, and amazing. They make the tacos, and you add the fixings yourself.   I love the fish machaca: very savory.. my husband loves the carne asada - amazing flavor. My favorite is their standard fish taco - always fresh, light and palatable with just about any fixing you like!   I normally go to the Phoenix location, my favorite - one in Tempe too!  Both are good. The owner of these stores is really down to earth, passionate about good authentic food and truly cares about your experience every time you come in. Love that! So hard to find. Go here, you won't be disappointed!"}

{"text":"For a fast food place for lunch... perfectly simple."}
{"text":"This place is so small, seems like a fast food taco place...but, OH IT'S NOT. It's amazing!  Small restaurant, with a small menu, super casual, has a fast food feel to it; the few items they have in the menu, they definitely do them right.  I went for the first time yesterday, on a weekday during my lunch hour, decided to get their \"campechano\" tacos in a combo, which is half fish + half shrimp...2 tacos, a drink, and fries; figured it was a decent meal.  SURPRISE!! Tacos are HUGE and meaty, I couldn't even finish them! They serve you the tortilla w/ the meat, and they have a salsa/veggie bar for you to prepare them w/ the toppings you want. Shrimp tasted FRESH! They don't cook the tacos until you order them. The salsa bar has a great combination of true Mexican and white washed salsas, very great combination! Cabbage, pickled onions, jalapenos, salsa, chipotle cream sauce, very nice variety. Their Ranch does not taste like ranch, it's more like a seasoned garlic cream sauce that tastes amazing! The fries are seasoned fries, cooked to perfection!  The service was great, friendly staff, everything super clean, quickly done order, very satisfied.  I am a fan, and I will definitely ill be going back."}
{"text":"Came on Taco Tuesday!  I got two shrimp tacos and fries and opted for a free drink upgrade vs an extra taco.  The batter on the shrimp was nice and crispy. They have a salad and salsa bar that you can freely top your taco with chipotle sauce and avocado sauce, peppers, and salsa. The fries were also delicious. At first sight the tacos looks small but with the seasoned fries and the extra toppings from the salad bar we left stuffed and happy! If your really felling adventurous try watermelon tea with sprite while your at it my personal fave"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  The carne asada is good quality steak as opposed to the rubber most Mexican restaurants in Arizona serve you.  They also have a nice selection of interesting dipping sauces and tasty chips/salsa.  My kids had the fish/shrimp tacos and loved them as well.  Would definitely return if in the area."}
{"text":"Just tried Tortilla Fish for the first time on my lunch break. The place was clean and the staff was helpful. I got the fish tacos and even though it was fried it was light and moist. Not greasy at all. There is a salsa bar with a variety of toppings and sauces. I particularly liked the extra hot sauce because I like things spicy. Def going back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Fish tacos are amazing.  The place is clean and friendly.  The food tastes too good to be fast food - however if you're trying to impress a date, the paper in plastic baskets won't do it.  Pack it up and take it somewhere nice and pass it off as more expensive fare.  Seriously though, this place is great.    The chipotle sauce is like crack.  I could easily see ending up homeless and toothless for just one more shot of the chipotle..."}
{"text":"NOM NOM NOM.  Very clean, everything tastes very fresh.  The salsa bar is as good as everyone says.  The fries were tasty too.  I think their shrimp is slightly better than their fish.  I normally hate corn tortillas, but was fine with these.  Buy 2 get one free on Tuesdays!  In the strip mall facing Walmart next to Panda Express."}
{"text":"Bring an appetite AND all of your friends with you.  These tacos are legit!!  We almost came back for dinner"}
{"text":"I found this little shop one day while craving fish tacos about a year ago. The fish tacos are delish! Definitely stop by on TACO TUESDAYS, buy two get one free! The food and staff are great! Really nice looking place always clean. The tacos are also BIG and well worth the price."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that I'm not a big seafood eater, but with places like this, it is starting to grow.  I'm always up for trying new things, and a fish taco establishment is definitely new for me.  (I know, I'm deprived.)  I work with the owner's wife, so she suggested that I try it.  I decided to look up the place here, and I think it's a good thing if a place has been open for less than two years, has nearly 190 reviews and a rating of 4.5 stars.  That's quite an achievement because the first few years are the hardest for a business.  So I had to go.  After last night, I'm definitely going back.  Everything is made to order, and it's all homemade (try the ranch dressing with French fries - yum).  If you haven't been there before, the staff will let you know what the favorites are and how everything is prepared.    The menu is small, but I think less is more.  If your menu is too large, then the quality can decrease.  Every bite is packed with delicious flavor.  You get the tacos, and dress them up however you want, so you're responsible if you make it too hot.  :)  Everything is made to order, so if you go during peak times, you can expect to wait a moment or two longer, but they are quick, so you're fine if you only have 30 minutes for lunch....or you could just call ahead so you won't have to inhale your food.  :)  Best of all, this place is doing so well that they are going to open a second location soon in Mesa!  I'm so happy for these guys.  If you're in the mood for something new (if you've never had a fish taco), then definitely try this place.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Two words - cheap and yum! Go during happy hour weekday evenings for $1.99 fish tacos. The fish is perfectly buttery and flaky, and the salsa bar offers delicious fresh toppings, salsas, and sauces to personalize the tacos. The Texas Watermelon tea is nice with a squeeze of lime, and the bottles of cold Mexican Coke were tempting too! The staff was friendly and helpful. Come to Gilbert!"}
{"text":"W wa waeee was www  ^^^^I pocket Reviewed this place! My upper leg opened Yelp, found this place, gave 5 stars, and typed, \"W wa waeee was www\"!!! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Fish Machaca was pretty good.  Wife had the pulled pork which was pretty good as well.  wasn't a fan of the shrimp.  Overall good spot for the price point.  The service was great, very nice lady behind the counter and cook was helpful with to go stuff."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall this nondescript storefront would not have attracted my attention if not for my love of fish tacos. We read the menu above the counter and each ordered 3 tacos, 2 fish and 1 shrimp. Taco Tuesday,  buy 2 get one. Our lucky day. The fish tacos were filled with bite size lightly battered pieces of firm fish. You add your own toppings from the wide selection is salsas and veggies. We also got sides of beans and rice that were good but not the star. An excellent value for a quality product. Not fancy, but not pricy. Go now!"}
{"text":"I was sitting at home last night, and a major fish taco craving hit me.  There aren't any good fish taco places in Surprise (If there are, please let me know where to go!), so I knew I had to take a drive to go find some.  I had Tortilla Fish bookmarked and decided that I would head on down here when I woke up this morning.  I left my place in Surprise at about 10:30 and arrived down here just after they opened.    I walked in, studied the menu for a brief second and then placed my order.  I went with a Fish Taco, a Shrimp Taco, a Full Taco, and a Carne Asada Taco.  Tortilla Fish has a great Yelp check in offer, too....a free large drink!  Score!  Total for 4 tacos was just over $13.00.  The tacos come plain here and you dress them up yourself.  I went over to the do it yourself salsa bar and started getting some of my fixins together.  Speaking of fixins'....watch this Youtube clip from Eastbound and Down on HBO.  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG97kfnaFOA).  About 10 minutes later, my food was ready (Everything is cooked fresh to order).  Here is how everything was..........  Fish Taco-  This thing looked pretty good!  They chop up their pieces of fish here, so you get a full taco which would probably equate to 2 decent sized whole pieces of fish.  I dressed mine with some cabbage, some onions, some lime and a little bit of hot sauce. It tasted pretty good.  It had a nicely fried batter on it and the fish was nice and flaky.  The tortillas they use are pretty good and overall it was a solid fish taco.  4 stars!  Carne Asada Taco-  Eh...just ok.  The carne asada was pretty tender, but it didn't have a smokey, char grilled flavor that I prefer in my carne asada.  It wasn't bad in anyway, just average.  The best part about it was the tortillas...double wrapped flour tortillas!  I would not get this from here again.  3 stars!  Shrimp Taco-  Same style as the Fish Taco...they chop up the shrimp into smaller pieces and stuff the taco full of them! I dressed this one the same as my fish taco (cabbage, onions, some lime and hot sauce.)  I liked this one a tad better than the fish.  Both were good, but if I had to pick only one between the two, I would take the shrimp! 4.5 stars!  Full Taco-  Boom!  The Winner!  This taco is a combo of both fish and shrimp along with a yellow pepper that was stuffed with cheese.  This thing looked awesome!  It had all this oozing cheese on top as well as the chopped up pepper.  It kind of reminded me of the La Super Rica Especial from La Super Rica up in Santa Barbara (their version is a pasilla chile with cheese and adobada), but with seafood instead.  This taco came with 2 tortillas under it, so I made 2 tacos out of it.  I didn't even top this one with anything...just kept it plain, and it was fantastic!  The combo of the fried seafood, crunch of the pepper, and the melted cheese made this a fantastic taco.  When I come back, I think I will order 2 or 3 of these and call it a day.  By far, the best taco of the day!  5 stars!   Overall, I was pretty impressed. Skip the carne asada and stick with the fish and shrimp offerings.  The tacos were very good, the service was excellent, and the free drink (Coke products) with check in was a nice bonus!  This place is a bit far from my house, so unfortunately, I don't think I will be coming back often.  With that said though, if I have a strong fish taco craving, I know where to come!  I'm sure I will be back at some point!"}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely solved my craving for fish tacos! The large free drink was a plus, and there was an abundance of condiments and sauces at the salsa bar. Too bad I missed happy hour but I will for sure go back for more for a filling lunch at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in Phoenix! All the condiments you could ask for and they are all FREE! I recommend the regular fish taco and the machaca as well. You wouldn't expect it here, but you get some of the best fries you will ever taste (dip it in the chipotle southwest sauce for best results ;) ) TOTALLY recommend this place!"}
{"text":"In Tempe for spring training. Wanted something lite. Found tortilla fish on yelp and it was 2 mile from our hotel. I was expecting a hole in the wall Mexican place but it was in a Walmart shopping center next to Panda Express. We ordered one fish and one shrimp each. They came battered on a corn tortilla and you add your own toppings. The fish was nicely cooked and the toppings fit the bill. I was satisfied and met my goal of trying to eat better even on vacation."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good fish tacos. Tasty tender fish, and a salsa cart where you can customize your taco to suit your taste. My first time left me full and satisfied. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great place! Super clean, friendly staff, and authentic fish tacos that make me feel like I'm on vacay in Mexico. I'd been to their Tempe location once, but it is too far to make the trip regularly. I'm a little nervous about how much I'll be eating here now that they opened this location in my hood."}
{"text":"Fish taco yummy. Sadly chicken has an chemical taste to it, barbacoa extremely wet and the rice and beans can be had better elsewhere. But I'll come back for the fish taco only."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! All the best toppings available in the salsa bar! Friendly people and great fish tacos. Best I've had in AZ :)"}
{"text":"Always a clean establishment and friendly staff!  The food quality and portions are tops! The sauces are incredible!!!! The ranch, chipotle, avocado, etc... Are off the hook and all made at location, not store bought! Great salsa bar, I can guarantee u will NOT be disappointed!!! Oh and they also have a chicken tacos for those that don't like seafood! I caution u to try them because u WILL get hooked!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The staff is super friendly and the interior is clean. They fresh fry the fish when you order it, and then you can customize your toppings at their well-stocked taco bar. I like mine with slaw and avocado. So yummy! A great lunch spot, for sure."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Grilled Fish taco looked like cat food and didn't taste any better.  Took 2 bites and threw away."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had 3 tacos. The barbacoa was my favorite of the 3, but they were all great. I loved the toppings/salsa bar. My husband had a combination plate of tacos that he loved. My daughter loved the crunchy French fries. The staff was friendly and helpful and the seating area was clean including the highchairs."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos like everyone has said. Salsa bar is extensive and very friendly and helpful owner. Some outdoor seating, inexpensive but doesn't taste cheap."}
{"text":"This place has great sea food tacos. One of the best I have had here in Phoenix. The shrimp in the shrimp taco was breaded and full of flavor. A bite into one of those, will leave you wanting for more. They also have a wide selection of fresh condiments/salsa and sauces to top your tacos with. Their chipotle sauce is just amazing!! The place is clean and service is good. I would definitely go back for the shrimp taco there!"}
{"text":"OMG! You have to try the fish tacos!  Caution: they are really big and come with a lot of fish! I couldn't finish 2 of them, cause I wasn't expecting such huge tacos! Oh well, I still managed to get through them cause they are too delicious to waste. Taco Tuesday deal is a STEAL!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden near the Walmart shopping center. I have been here twice and will now be a regular. The place is super clean and the employees always very helpful and nice. The food and salsa bar is awesome. The portions are very large and the prices very inexpensive. We questioned how good could it be because of the low prices. That was shot out of the water when I opened up my fish tacos! The fish is fresh an I love their tortillas. The tarter sauce is very different but everyone liked it. I got my mom a fish dinner and she really enjoyed and the hot fries. We could definitely just share on dinner and be full. Instead we had lunch for the next day! I guess they have everything I was looking for . Fresh too!! Yumm"}
{"text":"This was a decent place. Mainly tacos and some quesadillas. The tacos are street style. You can either order individually or in a combo that comes with fries. I would stay stick with the fish in regards to the meat. The steamed fish was delicious, but the barbacoa was a bit bland. Everything else is passable.    Also they need some sort of music or ambient noise. You can hear a pin drop in there and it makes conversation hard."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why his place has gotten so many excellent reviews. Most of the fish is deep fried to mask the fishy flavor and the shrimp quesadilla has about 4 very small pieces of steamed shrimp in it. They also had a rodent trap in the women's bathroom, which left me without an appetite."}
{"text":"Love love love their fish tacos!!  The shrimp ones too.  My favorite is the fish machaca.  Pure wonderfulness and not fried.  The condiment / salsa bar has so many options to try.  Only draw back is that they are not open on Sunday...and that seems to be when I get my fish taco craving!  :)"}
{"text":"On my way home and starving today, the construction at 44th street diverted me here. What a happy diversion it was.   This place has \"happy hour\" daily with half price Fish Tacos. Two guesses what I ordered. They came out cooked to order, hot, not greasy and HUGE portions of flaky fish. And then I got to go get my fixins at the station- love places where I can try all the salsas and fun stuff on display. Got cabbage, lime, two kinds of salsas, and chipotle cream to make my tacos just perfect. Less than 5 bucks later, I'm stuffed and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Had never been here but took advice from Yelp. Let the guy behind the counter know I hadn't been there and he helped guide me through the menu, letting me know what was popular. Had a couple Full Tacos and they were great. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely the biggest burrito in town, it will take a week to digest. Great taste, great value."}
{"text":"This place has bomb fish tacos!!!!!! They are so good and so filling I can't eat more than two. They have the best fried fish and they have so many cool condiments and stuff to decorate your taco and make it super yummy! They have a great taco Tuesday too #lit"}
{"text":"Reminds me of eating tacos on the beach in Mexico, without worrying about if I'm going to get sick later. These are the real deal, it's a simple taco shop. You get your choice of fish, shrimp or both. And they are so tasty. I love that everything is made fresh and the salsa bar is terrific. These tacos aren't the most inexpensive running around $3/ea depending on what you get so plan on spending around ten with a drink for a good lunch. But I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"There are many taco shops that I'd go to before I come back here. I ordered a couple tacos and was disappointed when I got nothing but some meat on dried out tortilla. No cheese, salsa, or other fixings. Okay, so I didn't pay an extra $0.50 for cheese but that was because I was expecting more than just some meat and nothing else. Unfortunately, the meat wasn't very good and the salsa I added from their salsa bar (which was grubby and unappealing) didn't help either. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were great didn't get a chance to try anything else but look forward to coming again . Service was great"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in AZ that I've had easy! Fresh ingredients, the salsa bar is amazing. I like the full taco! The governador shrimp quesadilla is great too. I've never had anything bad here!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great fish tacos, bug portions, awesome salsa bar. Only thing I would change is having rice & beans as options on the menu. Fries were super tasty though. On and did I mention the salsa? Lol! One star missing because they could have a higher fish to breading ratio."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos I've ever had. Price seems high at first,  but each taco is equivalent to 2 of other places. My favorite is the full taco with fish, shrimp,  and a cheese filled yellow pepper.  I usually break it down to two tacos with the 2 tortillas they provide so I can fit my mouth around it. The music they play in the background is perfect for the food and atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! It was spotless/brand new inside.  The fish tacos are yummy (hand-dipped and fried fish nuggets) I love the topping bar - it's a great selection of cabbage and sauces and I liked adding as much as I wanted. The only thing missing was a side of tortilla chips and I found it strange that they offered French fries instead."}
{"text":"Cool little hole-in-the-wall shop to get fish tacos. Also like the salsa bar... buy two tacos get one free on Tuesdays"}
{"text":"Tortilla fish is great. You get a tortilla filled with meat, then get to add all of your own toppings from the toppings bar. I think its a fantastic idea because you can make it as unique or boring as you want. They also have coleslaw which is quite tasty on fish tacos!  Some people may find that annoying but I think its brilliant.   Also, I can't leave out... their french fries are AMAZING! BEST french fries I have ever had. Sometimes I will stop here just for french fries to add to whatever meal I ordered. I crave them. Don't skip out, you will regret it."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are terrible. They are fried and greasy, and the fish fell through the tortilla.  The french fries they had was better then the tacos.   Service was nice, food was horrible.  It was more like a fast food."}
{"text":"Great tacos, burritos and friendly service! Came here off of another yelp recommendation and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has excellent fish tacos. The fish feels and tastes fresh. Service was good and the staff were helpful, giving suggestions and laughing with us."}
{"text":"In the area and trusted yelp reviews. It was average at best. We tried 6 different tacos and shrimp queso. Disappointed overall after seeing 4.5 star yelp rating."}
{"text":"I hope this place stays in business and I almost feel guilty for not going more often it's just in a funky part of the shopping complex. I've eaten there around the time it opened and I liked the concept. Very generous topping salsa bar to truly make it your own. I had the basic white fish taco and shrimp taco.. It was about three bucks a taco service was quick the place was clean. It's a little bit more expensive than rubios but I prefer the delivery and actual product here. I think I would need three to be full but going into a fish taco place you shouldn't come in starving."}
{"text":"This place is always good. I started going here over 2 years ago when they first opened and I lived in the area. Now I work in the area and I still love eating here. The fish tacos are always fresh and the salsa bar is the best. The service is always impeccable and quick. I have only got the fish tacos. My boyfriend said the shrimp tacos were good just not as good as the fish. What a gem in a Walmart shopping center! Who would have thunk it."}
{"text":"Got fish tacos. I noticed they batter and fry their own fish which you just won't see at most fast dinning restaurants. The tacos are served plain but there is a toppings bar with just about all you could want. For the fish tacos especially I loved the slaw and the not-from-a-can/jar tartar sauce with just a drizzle of the very hot sauce. I will definitely go here again!  5 stars based on it being exemplary in it's category of fast-casual food. Definitely up there with some other recent novel additions in this category in the Phoenix area (like fast casual pitas/hummus bowls)."}
{"text":"I had the full taco which was amazing. Everything was so fresh and the homemade tartar sauce was amazing.  I will recommend this place to everyone who loves fish tacos"}
{"text":"Closest to a fish taco in Mexico as it gets.  The tacos are HUGE which is what a real taco should look like and the salsa bar offers endless options.  The Gobernador is my favorite cheat day treat, basically a shrimp quesadilla on corn tortillas.  The Campechano is also a great choice as you get both fish and shrimp."}
{"text":"Some of the best fish tacos I have ever had. The fish itself is very tasty (almost has a kind of Cajun seasoning) but the toppings are one of the highlights of the dining experience. They have a great selection of house made salsas, sauces, and other toppings for whatever taco you choose. Currently only offering corn tortillas but I have been told flour tortillas are coming soon. Staff is friendly and helpful. They do a buy 2 get 1 free deal on Tuesdays and the place is small so you may not find a table at lunchtime on Tuesdays! I rarely give out 5 stars but this is one of my favorite places for lunch so it's worth it...and worth you giving Tortilla Fish a try as well!"}
{"text":"The tacos jammed pack of fish and/or shrimp good enough to get full with one, the topping bar is good, great salsas and dressings"}
{"text":"Awesome fish tacos! I love the salsa/topping bar. I had 1 fish taco, and a mixed fish and shrimp taco. The oil was a little bitter, but not terrible. The tacos were stuffed, and I was way too full to finish the second one. The beans were way too spicy for my liking, but I'm not a fan of spicy hot foods and definitely wouldn't order them for my kid. There are a couple kinds of iced tea and a soda fountain. I left full and relaxed. Friendly cashiers and cook. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This little place had a small-ish menu that was big on flavor. The fish tacos were crunchy and a bit soft on the inside. Shrimp tacos were absolutely delicious - firm and flavorful.  Their little salsa bar had some great choices with fresh cabbage, tomatoes, onions, avocado crème, and three kinds of salsas. The rock shrimp quesadilla was pretty tasty too. If you've a hankering for fish tacos, stop on in and pay them a visit. They've been in business about three months and are friendly and clean."}
{"text":"Very good, diverse selection off filings then you get the toppings. Very nicely put together place and the workers are awesome. Everything home made"}
{"text":"I like fish and I like fish tacos so I thought this would be a no brainer. For the money you really don't get much, and it was mostly fried fish in a tortilla anyway. I'd say skip it and go to a legit Mexican place for fish."}
{"text":"Slow jazz style mexican music being played throughout the restaurant. Small place but bug enough to accommodate a lunch crowd.   Ordered the Carna Asada Burrito, Carna Asada Tacos, Fish Tacos with Rice and Beans.  The Carna Asada Burrito meat was good, they ask you to place condiments from the salsa bar to be wrapped inside the burrito. Average size burrito with generous amount of meat and good tasting tortilla.   The Fish Taco had a generous amount of crispy fish on a soft taco tortilla. Add the condiments like Pico De Gallo, tarter sauce and onions and you have a winner.  The 3 Carna Asada Tacos are a good buy for less than $6. Add whatever condiments from the bar and you have a quality soft taco.  Would definitely co.e back again"}
{"text":"There aren't many places in the Valley that specialize in fish tacos AND are well reviewed restaurants.  I was excited to try TF per the Yelp reviews and my expectations were surpassed.    The menu is small (shrimp, fish, chicken and barbacoa) but you are ultimately responsible for how you enhance the flavor of your fresh meal with the unbelievably tasty salsa bar options  That salsa bar is unlike any other offering I've experienced.  The house ranch is an addictive drug that enhances the taste of the already crispy fries.  The salsas, especially the extreme ones, are fantastic.  Add cabbage and chopped onions to finish things off and you'll maybe make it a week before returning for more fish taco heaven.  I'm very happy Tempe has an unrivaled fish taco shop that I can take guests to from out of town.  TF will make a mark in every visitors' taste buds.  *Tip 1* Tempe residents should check their mail for TF coupons from time to time  **Tip 2** If you return to TF, check to see if the owner remembers you.  I bet he will!!  ***Tip 3*** Half price tacos from 3-6 PM and buy 2 get 1 free on Tuesdays.  Work off the gluttony by playing some video games at Gamestop next door.  ****Tip 4**** Try to eat at the restaurant for your first visit.  The salsa bar should be experienced in house!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I had the 2 shrimp tacos and one fish taco. Both were good portions and delicious. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"AWESOME, even though we were the only ones there.... hope more people find this gem.   Tacos are made fresh to order. You get your base, corn tortilla and protein and then you dress them up how YOU want.     I tried one shrimp and one fish to get a baseline. Both were awesome... but I think the shrimp was the victor.  Make sure you get an order of fries so you can enjoy all the sauces. You absolutely must try mixing the cilantro cream with the Chipotle sauce."}
