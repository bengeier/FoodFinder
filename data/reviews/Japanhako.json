{"text":"this place is amazing. great food, good value and super awesome service. if you go there ask for kayo she is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. The salmon and tuna arburi were fresh and melt in your mouth. The scallop volcano which was baked was out of this world. The  vegetable  skewers were perfect.  This place is like Wow Sushi meets Guu then meets Zakkushi We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was drawn to this place by their specialty rolls, and the result was pretty impressive! We ordered the GTA rolls, the Scallop Volcano, and the treasure rolls. The GTA rolls were my favourite. I loved the aroma of torched salmon together with grilled shrimp; the sauce was tasty yet not overpowering. The treasure rolls were good too with fish eggs, but the jalape√±o in it was too spicy for me. Hubby loved the scallop volcano the most, which was oven baked with lots of cheese. Many of their specialty rolls are marked as torched or oven baked. I thought the idea was quite innovative and enticing. 

We were also very impressed by the sashimi salad. There were more than 6 pieces of each type of sashimi - salmon, red tuna, and another white fish ones that I couldn't name. The dressing was mayo based and had a nice hint of sesame.

Our yakitori (skewer) orders were fine. I liked the chicken cartillages, chicken thigh, and the pork with enoki, but not the ribeye which was too chewy. 

The chicken karaage was still drizzling oil and was the only one that was a bit of a letdown. 

Overall we really enjoyed the meal, plus the service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Found out about this place from blogto so i decided to bring my girlfriend along to give it a try. The place markets itself as a Yakitori/Izakaya joint, and apparently has one of the few places in Toronto with a true yakitori grill.

Environment (4/5) - Nice overall decor. Typically Japanese interior styling which I'm always a fan of!

Service (4/5) - Very friendly and helpful staff. Always greeted with a nice smile.

Food (3/5) - This was where i felt the place is lacking a bit.

We started off with a seaweed salad, which tasted fairly standard but good nonetheless.

Then we decided to order the Katsuo (bonito) onigiri just for something a little different. Unfortunately, it was not very good. The rice seemed a bit too dry and cold. In addition, the onigiri was too salty for my liking. I personally would not recommend it.

For the mains, i went for the Hakozushi set, which is their pressed square sushi. It also came with a choice of 5 pieces of any of their special rolls. I choose the \"Treasure roll\" which was basically a spicy salmon roll. Aesthetically, the hakozushi looked great. The fish quality was surprisingly great - fresh and flavourful. However, the sushi rice was just not cutting it for me - it was dry and not warm enough. In terms of the special rolls, it was good but nothing to rave over. Alongside the set, i ordered 3 pieces of yakitori (harami, nakaochi, and buta tomato). A little salty, but still very tasty! I also ordered vegetable yaki set just to balance out the meat flavours which was done well.

Overall, the place has great service, and decor however the food just wasn't quite to my liking. I think a few tweaks in their sushi rice would change my mind next time. Now would i come back again?If i'm around the Koreatown area perhaps. But i feel that there are better options in the city."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Excellent service. Great yakitori.  Only thing that's a miss is their sushi dishes - not because of the freshness of the seafood (because it is very fresh!), but sadly because of their bland sushi rice.  Great sushi to me is all about the freshness of the fish, and the proper preparation and seasoning of the rice.  They just need to improve this and I would give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Quality food, cozy atmosphere, nice stuff!!
Aburi sushi is special, well-flavoured and tasty!
???!!!"}
{"text":"Went here recently with a friend. Service was pretty quick and reliable. Our server kept on coming by to check on our water. The food was really delicious, we just got two plates of specialty maki and for the price it was worth it. When eating here as a group you don't have to worry about breaking the bank, and I would definitely go again to take more people here! Went sometime ago earlier this year too, tried the yakitori which was really really good!!"}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant being featured on a video from BlogTO and decided to check it out. Seems like the 2 most popular things at this restaurant are the skewers and the sushi. I decided to get the skewers since I eat sushi a lot and wanted to try something different. 

I ordered the premium set ($15) which came with a total of 5 skewers: 3 beef, 1 pork, and 1 tofu. For the price I paid, I expected better quality and quantity. The meat was chewy and just didn't have much flavour. Some of skewers didn't even look full.

Be warned: they do not split the bill. I came in as a group of 10 and the waitress said she would split it for us in the beginning but when we asked for the bill, she said she couldn't split it. We kind of expected this though, especially since you can order the skewers individually. It would make it too difficult for them to split it. So that was understandable.

I'm willing to give this place another try, as their sushi looked a lot better. But I'll for sure be skipping the skewers."}
{"text":"Very friendly service. 
Sashimi set was fresh and nicely proportioned. 
Ordered the takoyaki, it was bomb :) 
The veggie tempura was very nice."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time last night.  Overall, it was great- they offer great quality for the money, and that's the expectation I'd go in with. Simple, elegant interior and friendly staff. And I liked that they let us go at our own pace. We ordered the GTA roll and volcano scallop roll, along with some skewers. All very tasty. I'd go back and order it all again."}
{"text":"This place was such a disappointment. The skewers definitely need more seasoning, they had no flavour. The sushi was also unimpressive. The fish did not tasty very fresh, and I don't like sauce on my sushi, especially on nigiri. Their \"house made soy sauce\" is so light, it has no taste whatsoever. When you dip your sushi in it, it taste like you are dipping your sushi in water. In addition, I came on a cold day, and was seated near the front door, and was constantly blasted by cold wind because their door would not stay shut. Terrible experience all around. The reason behind their high rating is because they offer 10% off your bill if you leave a 5-star review. Frauds."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through a friend and was sold when he said really good Japanese place for cheap. It has a suitable interior for an izakaya. It's a chill, casual vibe, with wooden furniture, perfect for some bar Japanese food. 

One thing I thought was really nice was a complementary chef creation. It was a interesting plating use if rice, seaweed and tuna. Free things are great :) 

Now, some items are really good. They should be charging more for that quality so you get quite deal with cheap amazing food. But their other items seemed bland and flavourless...So I would return but only for specific items. 

If I were to visit here regularly, my go to item would be the GTA roll, any sort of skewer and a sushi-sashimi set. The torched flavour was phenomenal... It really dances on your palate. Highly recommend! 

I tried the rib-eye and some chicken skewer (I forgot which part, but they do list options of different cuts for the skewer.) The rib-eye was juicy and a really nice tender bite. Goes great with a glass of ice cold Sapporo. 

The sushi set was little above average. The fish could be fresher but it is satisfactory. Also, the set we ordered came with miso soup. There seemed to be a deeper flavour in this miso soup compared to most that really complements the sushi. 

The service is a little slow as the restaurant was a little empty but the pace food was coming out longer than expected. However, they ladies checked up frequently to pour tea. They were super polite and really positive so you feel welcomed being there. 

For the most part, it's a nice place in Koreatown. I'd definitely visit again but they definitely need to improve on some classic Japanese dishes that were lacking but came with high expectations."}
{"text":"Awesome staff and food. I ordered the Chicken Katsu dinner which comes with a salad and miso soup. It was delectable! I also ordered a fruity sake which was nice. The place is casual and I love how they play cool songs! I tried to Shazam it, but it didn't work. I will definitely visit the place again once I visit Canada!"}
{"text":"I can't comment on the other food, but if you're looking for aburi sushi, sorry, this is NOT the place for it. I ordered the salmon and tuna aburi from Foodora a couple of weeks back, and the freshness wasn't an issue but the taste was. There was wayyyy too much creamy sauce, no flavour, and just all-around bad. Other places like momo san have really mastered the art of aburi, with nuanced flavours and the right amount of sauce, so this place should learn from them."}
{"text":"What a beautiful experience. This new Japanese restaurant in Koreatown is so much more than just a typical sushi place on Bloor.  The service was wonderful and the foods were beyond delicious (I recommend the hakozushi A set and pick from a huge selection of yakitori). Most of all, this place was extremely authentic. I truly believe that Japanhako is a game changer for Japanese food in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place had really good yelp ratings so I was pretty hyped to check it out. The service here is good and the servers are all super attentive, but unfortunately the food / price was a disappointment. My friend and I didn't even bother to order another round and ended dinner early because the food was very 'meh' but also pretty expensive for the portion size. All the skewers had the same salty taste to them, and I felt the fish to rice ratio was off in the sushi.

tldr; come here if you want to give your taste buds a break for the day, or perhaps for the cheaper lunch menu."}
{"text":"Japanhako is a newly opened Japanese skewer+sushi izakaya in Korean Town (Christie and Bloor). The ambiance is nice and not overly loud like what you get at Kinka/Guu. They have signature rolls that are either torched or oven baked. We tried the GTA (similar to Dynamite Rolls) and the Pink Lady (similar to spicy Salmon Rolls). The skewers we tried two beef, two chicken and two pork. In general, their skewers were just ok. The beef was blend and kind of dry, the pork were too salty. The chicken wings were the best ones for tonight. The service was excellent. If you're in the annex, it's a good new place to try or have a beer with your friends. But I would not travel far just for the food."}
{"text":"Japanhako is a yakitori nested in Koreatown. Japanhako is one of the few true yakitori (grilled meat and vegetables) in Toronto.  While it serves sushi and sashimi, Japanhako specializes in a wide range of yakitori (chicken, pork, beef, tofu and other vegetables). The yakitori is very good and I would recommend trying the premium set so that you get a sample of the different meats and vegetables. 

The sushi and sashimi is also very good.  There is a huge range of sake so that pairs well with the sushi and yakitori. 

The atmosphere is not fancy. It looks like a Japanese bar. The service is attentive, but somewhat slow. Overall, I would recommend trying out Japanhako if you like yakitori."}
{"text":"Super cute small little restaurant! My companion and I wanted to try everything on the menu. We ordered: hakozushi set with treasure roll, beef tartar, ebi tempura, chicken karage, aburi salmon sushi, scallop volcano. As for skewers, we tried: chicken cartilages, beef shoulder, ribeye, pork neck, pork belly, and scallop. They were having a 20% promo, pricey came up to be approx. $80 after discount.

Hakozushi set: I've been seeing pictures all over Instagram of these cute square sushi sets. It looked great but tasted average. (And now I understand why normal sushi isn't square shaped, it was so difficult to pick it with chopsticks and fit it in my mouth. Or it could just be that I suck at using chopsticks.) Treasure roll was quite tasty though.

Beef tartar: Too chewy for my liking. Unfortunately, below my expectations. Would not recommend.

Ebi tempura: Above average. Very fresh.

Chicken karage: Average. Pretty good. Also very fresh.

Aburi salmon sushi: Definitely the highlight of my meal. One of the best aburi salmon I have ever had in Toronto. There was a cream sauce topping that just made it taste so much better. This is a must try!

Scallop volcano: Oven baked roll with some sort of cream sauce with mushroom and scallop on top. Very good. Would recommend.

Skewers: The ribeye was the best skewer I have ever had. Totally worth $6. It just melted in my mouth. The beef shoulder was also worth mentioning, it was very flavourful and the meat was well cooked. The scallop was also very good. It was a bit dry but still very delicious.

Service was great. We felt a little bit rushed when the waitress came around 3 times to take our order when we weren't ready yet, but I don't blame her, we took our time. The waitress also took our coats to coat check which was great. Overall, I would recommend this place. The place was pretty empty for Sunday night, but I would still recommend booking in advance."}
{"text":"Suppose to be a sushi and yakitori place but we got chicken katsu donburi and paitan ramen. My sister enjoyed the donburi and I thought the noodles were just ok. I think it is too pricey for the amount of food your getting. 
Did not make us full so we ended up getting more food elsewhere. The workers are nice and the place is appealing. It's a cute little place. Overall, I would come back to try their sushi and yakitori, maybe with a bigger group so we can order a bunch of grub and share."}
{"text":"It's prob only a two $ sign place imo (instead of 3 as yelp reports). The sushi quality is amazing considering the price level and squared sushi is their speciality. The main waitress is one of the most friendly and really cares about what their customers want."}
{"text":"The food at Japanhako was great! We got sashimi set as well as a sushi set, fish was fresh and sizes were very generous. We also ordered yakitori and found it delicious! Would recommend the extreme dynamite roll!"}
{"text":"Never expected such a good quality plate of sushi from an izakaya. Oh boy I was wrong. 
Whenever I dine at a sushi or Japanese place, I appreciate good quality miso soup. It is a simple soup that could be easily overlooked if the restaurant doesn't pay attention to details. Wow their square-shaped sushi was sooo good. I still can't believe I had all that food under $13 (before tax and tip for lunch only). The portion was so generous that I had to leave behind one piece. 

Nice, clean decor and friendly service. Amazing good and reasonable price. Japanhako became one of my new favourite Japanese places in the gta!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because of the beautiful pictures I had seen of their square sushi. Unfortunately, although the fish tasted fresh, the sushi rice was not good and kind of ruined the overall taste. It was too salty and not vinegar-y enough. I also tried the GTA roll and the treasure roll - these weren't bad. I suspect that the yakitori is where this place shines; the few chicken and beef skewers I tried were quite good. Would not go back for the sushi."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and fresh sushi! Had the awesome GTA roll and can't wait to come back for more :)"}
{"text":"3.5 - - Great assortment of Japanese food ranging from sushi, ramen, tapas and of course yakitori. Ordered some yakitori and sushi, I thought my hand roll was great. Seasoned rice with a good portion of fish as well. With regards to the yakitori, I was expecting a bit more a smokey taste to the meat. Most of it was chewy. I am not sure if I am being harsh as I have not had many other experiences to compare it to. Their chicken wings were delicious though. Seasoned well and cooked with crispy edges. I can find this restaurant a great choice for groups, as it offers such a wide selection. However I simply found the food okay. The service however was great and that's why I am giving it 0.5 extra, so attentive, even for our larger group."}
{"text":"Decided to come here since i was in the area and the reviews said it was pretty decent. THIS PLACE WAS SO DISAPPOINTING. As soon as we sat down there were fruit flies everywhere. Flies continued to bother us the entire meal. We ordered 5 skewers and 3 out of 5 (gyu tongue and chicken hearts) were extremely salty. The type of salty where you gotta chug a glass of water after.The other two were chicken cartilage and smelled super funky. They smelled like wet dog and tasted kind of cheesy?? I asked the waitress if it was marinated or something trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. She said they just use salt on the meat. The chicken meat was grey and definitely off. We also got the ankimo which was okay, it wasn't dressed up or anything. Just a bunch of salt around the rim of the plate. The yukke was pretty decent. Also you could probably get better takoyaki at a night market or even a bubble tea place. 

The waitress was nice but seemed really new at her job. 

Definitely not coming here again."}
{"text":"Saw this on BlogTO and it had good reviews so I was expecting better quality food and service than we received. We were asked to write a good review for 10% off the bill, but we did not take advantage of that. I'm guessing this is why they have such an inflated rating. 

We went on a Thursday night, there was one friendly waitress working the entire restaurant (around 15 groups). Unfortunately she seemed very inexperienced and our meal took close to two hours, around half of that time waiting on one sushi roll.

Our bill rang in around $200 for two people; this place is _expensive_. We ordered one small bottle of sake, one appetizer, one sushi roll, and two rounds of skewers for reference.

The food was good, but considering price you pay, it's probably better to try another izakaya."}
{"text":"Very fresh sashimi.  Large pieces of salmon, blue fin tuna, and mackerel. 

The sashimi is fresh and melts in your month.  

We also ordered their \"special \" rolls.  Do go crazy in this section of the menu.  The special rolls are highly inventive and interesting.  We ordered the GTA and the Treasure.  The Treasure roll was so good we had seconds. 
 
Do you like sake?  I do.  They have a fair selection of sake imported from Japan.  You can't go wrong!

Give this sushi spot a shot.  Don't settle for lame cheap sushi.  Eat real japanese.  A cut above!"}
{"text":"People are friendly. Service is great. But i wish they can give some side dishes."}
{"text":"Super disappointed coming here given that the I had seen nice pictures of the place and also noted that it was a yakitori restaurant. I thought the menu had a variety of options but honestly, the food wasn't amazing. I don't remember what I had anymore because everything was just mediocre. I think we tried the aburi salmon sushi, some yakitori, a mussels special dish and something else.I found some items were overly seasoned as well.The service was also quite slow."}
{"text":"Came here before and it's been pretty good. Came tonight and the service was terrible. We ordered a lot of food and drinks and got literally 1 shot each after being here for 20 minutes and having to go up multiple times to remind the woman for our shots. She was also very rude and acted like it was annoying having to deal with us ordering things when she was practically ignoring us. Also tried to make up a bunch of rules that makes no sense about how many shots we could get and only allowed 2? Really weird and bad experience"}
{"text":"No reservation on weekend but that's not why I give 3 stars.  It's the quality of food. 
Sashimi Set: all sashimi taste exactly the same.  Not fresh.  Not sweet. No fish taste.  Taste like frozen fishes. 
The GTA roll is okay.  
The pressed sushi set: too little fish and too much rice.  The portion is just wrong.  The fish doesn't stick on the rice.  The whole thing is a failure. 
The skewers are not bad."}
{"text":"Still haven't gotten a chance to go to Japanhako yet but I have already been having their food delivered to home by Ubereats a handful of times. The twelve pieces of sushi combo for only $16.90 is my go-to.

I'm sure if one has experience ordering sushi from food delivery apps will automatically set the expectation quite low. Surprisingly, this fairly-reasonably-priced sushi combo's been giving me a sense of decency. Ingredients on top were still quite fresh when arrived but the rice can get a little hard and chewy at times (having to delivery might be to blame)."}
{"text":"The experience was very disappointing. I went with a  group of 6 when the restaurant just opened. Given the instagram hype and the initial high reviews on yelp, I was quite excited to try the food. Unfortunately, the sushi did not taste anywhere as good as how it looked. It was very bland and had a strong fishy taste. Everything we ordered - variety of sushi and skewers - was of similar quality to an average or typical AYCE sushi place. I do not recommend and will not be returning."}
{"text":"We arrived before 6PM and the restaurant was empty. However, it was filled up quickly shortly after 6:30PM

Since it was our snack, we ordered the GTA rolls, Premium Set and Japanhako Set. 

GTA rolls - it is a torched salmon roll with shrimp and spicy crabmeat. The sauce was tasty and we enjoyed it. The size of the shrimp is not \"huge\" as the menu describes. 

Japanhako set - mainly are different part of chicken. This set was pretty good. 

Premium set - different cuts of beef. There was supposed a Yuzu Miso Tofu I really wanted to try, but they replaced it with another skewer of beef without notified us. The skewers looked pretty similar and the staff didn't describe each skewer to us. Not until I checked with the staff if it was a wrong order and she verified with the kitchen for us. Most of the skewers tasted similar/ same except the cuts and texture were different. The meat on one of the skewers was not very fresh. 

Overall the experience was okay and we enjoyed the grand opening 20% off discount. I like the rolls better than the skewers. I may go back to try their square sushi next time."}
{"text":"Such a great experience!  Atmosphere great - unlike other izakayas you can actually hear and participate in a conversation. Sushi was good as well - GTA special roll is a must have. The oysters motoyaki are different and cool as well. Very friendly staff and glad to have sushi as an option with my tempanyaki!  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice resto! 
Saw this on blogto's post on Facebook 

The sushi was amazing ! 
We got the maki combo which was 6 pieces of either California or the spicy special (spicy tuna) with your choice of special Maki's! 

The taste was so good!  We got the snow prince and I forgot what the other one is called. I think baked salmon? 
Both was phenomenal, I had no expectations for the spicy tuna rolls but it was fantastic! 
The special rolls are the bomb as well! 
They also have grilled skewers ,we tried and it was not bad .
The tea that they serve is good! Barley tea I believe ! 
However I saw on the menu that they charge $2 for water? 
We got 10% off for liking them on Facebook! 
Price was not bad! Pretty good! 
The menu has so much items we were overwhelmed !
#worthit"}
{"text":"We came here in a group of 6 on a Saturday evening. We were seated immediately and the place wasn't busy at all. Service was phenomenal, our server was really attentive and also quick on refilling our water whenever our glasses were empty. 

In regards to food, I can't say I'm a huge fan but it was flavorful. We tried the Volcano Scallop roll -- I wasn't a big fan of this dish because they doused it mayo so it became extremely creamy on the palate. 

The menu is a hit-or-miss. I really like vegetables so I decided to order two vegetable skewers - zuchinni and eggplant. And note to self - to never order these skewers again. They were just just two thinly sliced zuchinni and eggplant pieces for $1.90 each, heavily seasoned with olive oil and salt. Definitely not worth my money. My friend also ordered the \"cheese filled hot dog skewer\" which was just Schiender's hot dog on a skewer (I don't recommend this either). 

The Japanhako set saved the day for me because this was a really delicious. I honestly would come here again just for this specific dish. So if you don't want to be disappointing, order this dish."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I REALLY wanted to like this place. We were ending off an anniversary getaway weekend with this meal but it definitely left us disappointed.

We had a huge lunch so we just dropped by Japanhako for a small snack. The place is a bit easy to miss but the decor and lighting is really nice. What intrigued us about the place was the Hakozushi (square sushi). We were still bloated from lunch so we just ordered the Hakozushi set ($16) and planned on ordering a skewer set afterwards if we were still hungry. 

We waited about an hour before our order came and it ended up being the wrong one. They gave us a $40 premium sushi + sashimi set. We notified our servers in case they gave us someone else's food by accident, and they apologized and took the sushi back and said they'll switch the order back. We had to wait another 30-40 mins for our original order to come back (just 8 pieces of sushi). When we asked for our bill, we almost got charged for the $40 set again.

I think this place would've been great but think this situation could have been handled better. I would wait a while before trying this restaurant after they're a bit more established."}
{"text":"I've been twice now since this place opened the other month and it's really great. A bit expensive for the portion sizes but the food quality is on point. I'm also really into the decor/atmosphere. I brought a friend who just moved here from Japan and even she really liked it."}
{"text":"I just had Japanhako for dinner, it was superb.

I've long wanted to try it, as it looks like a sharp new edition to Koreatown, but I still hadn't made it in. I was pleased to see it all up on my fave delivery apps.

I had their Tonkotsu ramen. Yes, it's late June. No, I don't care. I loved it! Their take away containers are better than the uge ramen setup, which I loved. Kudos for sending the meat of the dish in a bowl I can just pour my broth into. Everyone else, take note. 

Their sushi list looks divine, and I'll be trying that soon. Hopefully in person!"}
