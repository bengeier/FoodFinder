{"text":"Lee Chen is one of the most underrated restaurants in Toronto. It's really good, the decor is great and it's food is delicious. It's fun, cheap and really awesome. Despite some flaws, Lee Chen is great."}
{"text":"Went here Jan 1 and ordered the following:
- fiery wontons
- xiao long bao
- hot and sour noodle soup
- Kung pao chicken

Fiery wontons weren't as good as they normally are. Looked like they had been sitting out for a while. 

Xiao long baos were fresh, hot and delicious as usual. Not as good as ding tai fungs but a great showing nonetheless

Hot and sour soup with noodles was good. Oddly came with rice noodles, was expecting egg noodles.

Kung pao (something we never order) was surprisingly the stand out of the meal . SO GOOD - nothing fried just deliciousness!

So great to have a delicious dumpling place in yorkville!"}
{"text":"Great service and clean facilities. The soup dumplings were perfect and did not break apart. The lions head was also just right and not too salty. Not a lot of vegetarian options for my family member. No parking hard to get to. Overall, the food was good quality but a little ordinary."}
{"text":"After a full day of sightseeing we walked up an appetite and Lee Chen was the perfect place, Delicious!!! Pork Cabbage dumplings, ribs, chicken with black bean sauce all yummy. I am sure to visit again when we are back in Toronto."}
{"text":"I ordered kungpao chicken on Uber eat and only to find out there are two long hair underneath the chicken. Truly disgusting. 
I swear to god."}
{"text":"Delicious food, the most charming wait staff, and great prices... three important reasons that Lee Chen has become one of my family's favourite places to eat in Toronto."}
{"text":"Don't bother with take-out! 
That'll teach me to not check Yelp before ordering! I had a serious hankering for Chinese food this morning and had to wait hours for restaurants to open to satiate said hunger. I placed an order through orderit so I could go about my day (of rewatching Lost from the beginning). SO DISAPPOINTED (in the food, not in Lost). This is absolutely not the place to get your Chinese food fix from. I wanted to go all out with food but it was a waste of $50 on 2 combos and an order of mixed veg. I wanted enough food to feed 2 of us for 2 meals. This barely fed us for 1.  We ordered General Tso combo and Crystal Pork Belly combo. The veggies that came with it? 2 pieces of broccoli. 
Waste of money and food was only okay. But I'd say a lot is my fault for not checking what kind of restaurant it really is, but I won't be ordering take-out from here again."}
{"text":"Love coming here! For the price the food is just always delicious. Even the location is great. Everything from the soup to the fried rice is great. Literally my go to Asian restaurant for a causal dining/lunch."}
{"text":"Decor is nicer than most of Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, the soup steamed bun is tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Clean!  Great People!  We went to this restaurant because it was only a block away from our hotel.  We were very impressed.  We experienced the quality on par with those in Los Angeles and San Francisco.  We ordered Popcorn Chicken, Soup Dumplings, Fried Pork Dumplings, Crystal Pork Belly, Tang Yuan, and Shang Hai Soup Noodle.  All of them were excellent.  We wished their portions were a little smaller so we could try more on their menu. Everyone was very helpful and nice.  Will go back there again next time we go to Toronto.  Oh, they are a kid friendly place."}
{"text":"Came here at lunch to a completely full restaurant. Can't believe I haven't heard of it before. Really good food - particularly their steamed soup dumplings. The wrapping is very thin and really authentic. Their braised pork belly over rice is also top notch."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now in the last month or so... The pork soup dumplings are so yummy! We tried a few other things on the menu, but those were by far our fav!"}
{"text":"This wasn't the best Thai food, it had a strong Chinese influence, then meat was low quality and I ended up with a rather large headache afterward, most likely from the MSG added to it. Recommended only if you like Chinese food."}
{"text":"You absolutely must try the soup filled dumplings. These are so rare and unique to find in Toronto because the dumplings are hand made to order. 
Everything at this restaurant is delicious. The dishes are made up of simple, fresh ingredients but complex cooking techniques. I really enjoyed discovering this place and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food. Served fast. Tasty. Lots of options to choose from. Not greasy dirty food like Chinese food court food. Enjoyed my time dining. The ambiance is nice. Clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. I am a frequent diner here and look forward to it every time!"}
{"text":"Soup dumplings were delicious and succulent. Pork ribs could have been a little more well done, but were tender and juicy nonetheless. Great sauce on those - sweet and salty. Spicy shrimp wasn't the greatest. Shrimp were perfectly cooked, but the sauce was too sweet and rich for my taste. Will definitely come again to try more items as everything was excellent on this first visit."}
{"text":"Ordered Xiao Long Bao and spicy beef soup noodle. Both were decent. Clean and nice decor. It would be a good place for quick lunch break when shopping in the Bloor area."}
{"text":"I bought voucher for this deal because I am a fan of authentic dumpling house, and had the chance to come dine with my gf.

When entered, my gf and I def liked the appearance and decor of this place. It reminds us of old chinese movies when ppl having tea and such.
We were greeted by a friendly server who was very helpful in recommendation and we started off by ordering a Pina Colada drink and a bubble milk tea (without bubbles). Both drinks were good.

Since we have $20 for $40 value of voucher, we splurged a bit on items to enjoy. We got 2 orders of 'Xiao Long Bao' which is soup filled dumplings. This is just as good as 'Dumpling King', although the skin is not as thin as 'Ding Tai Fung' back when it was a hit, nevertheless, it is still yummy. 

2nd dish was the pan fried shrimp dumplings. (6pcs) good size dumpling. Perfect crispy skin and good filler inside with a bit of soup in it as well.

3rd dish was the Szechuan Shrimp with garlic. Tiger size shrimp with about 12+pieces and it tasted fresh and delicious.

4th dish was the best dish of the night and the BEST braised meatballs we have eaten at a restaurant PERIOD! Its a juicy pork meatballs braised in clear broth served with bok choy. The meatball had sweet flavour and was super uber tender on the inside. 

On to desserts: Fried banana top with chocolate syrup and peanut. This was a really well done fried banana.
Also had their rice ball with peanuts that had black sesame on the inside. Its really chewy and soft.

In the end we went over the bill of our voucher and spent an extra $40+ but it was really good. Next time we are gonna try their other signature dish like their Crystal Pork Stew and their twice cooked pork.

Service was impeccable and delightful
Food was really good all the way
Price is reasonable
Location is a bit hidden and just needs great exposure.

I will come dine here even without vouchers!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out after some Bloor errands/shopping. It's fairly new and usually empty-ish inside. 
Once inside, you'll be impressed by the simple and elegant decor. Really clean bathrooms (is that key in eating?! Well, you can tell a lot about a place about how well they maintain their WC's, lol.)

Menu is on the sparse side so if you're looking for variety, this probably won't be the place to check out. But in terms of a decent Asian style dinner with friends, it's pretty good. Prices are fair, booze is decently priced and there are a few spots where you can seat a big group."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner here tonight. Having just moved into the neighbourhood it is good to know that there is a good Chinese restaurant nearby. The place is very contemporary in decor. The service is good and quick. The food is very tasty and hot.  We loved the king mushroom and pea shoots as well as the black pepper beef. The Lee Chen fried rice was great as it wasn't greasy. 

We'll be back in the future again to try more things on their menu."}
{"text":"I love Pad Tai however I would not reccomend this place for this particular dish. It was very light if not minimal on sauce and a lot of chilli flakes. It had no flavor! Tasted like hot noodles with chilli flakes. Save yourself the disappointment.  I'm so disappointed with how flavorless this dish was, that I will not try anything else on this menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food, consistently good service. I've been here several times since I discovered this new location (had been to the one in Yorkville many times previously). For downtown, this is a great choice in Chinese food at a fairly reasonable price. While I can't tell you if it's authentic, the food is certainly tasty. The Yorkville location wasn't consistent in the quality of the food, this one has been spot-on every single time, and everything I've tried has been great: the soup dumplings (a must-try if you've not tried them - and once you do, you'll want them again), the pan-fried dumplings, the hot and sour soup, various fried rice dishes, the lettuce wraps, and several more. Oh, and they actually have great chili oil!"}
{"text":"We had the pad thai, the soup dumplings, the onion pancake, and a dim sum item. Food quality is very high for the area ... service is commendable. There was always someone close by to bring an extra drink, or hot sauce.

The atmosphere at lunch time was busy, not too loud, and the food arrived at the table very quickly.

We shared the pad thai (vegetarian) and were pleased that it was not bright red when it was presented. The onion pancake was a nice starter, but the soup dumplings were the star of the meal for myself.

The menu is long and varied, so there will be something for everyone."}
{"text":"Finally, I can have Chinese food around Yorkville area not that expensive. I tried most dim sum items. They are delicious. I cannot believe it. Wow. From now on, I don't need go up to north to have Chinese Chinese Food. Great! And their fry rice are great."}
{"text":"Really what I was looking for. The dumpling was up there with some of the best I've tasted and the fried chicken was extremely tasty."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Chinese food! Very good atmosphere. Every dish we ordered is exceed our expectation. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today.  It was for lunch.  Interior is very big and clean.  Wait staff was friendly and attentive.
I had the beef brisket noodle soup.  It was delicious.  My friends all took the lunch options, and they all enjoyed it.
I would come back for lunch in a heartbeat since it is tasty and the price is reasonable.
Did find the menu a little pricey for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the food is pretty reliable. Not the best I've ever had, but pretty decent. If you want to take friends that are not familiar with Chinese food, this is a pretty easy place for them to experience it. The soup dumplings are on par with what I've had at Asian Legend, though with limited options and not as good as what I had in Shanghai. If you come here, order the bao with shredded pork. It's something you have to assemble, but it's delicious.

Service is usually pretty good and it's one of the nicer, cleaner Asian places in the area."}
{"text":"Came in quickly for a late night bite at 9:30. Despite the fact they close at 10 and I though the staff would be irritable, they welcomed me with open arms and immediately sat me. I had never tried a majority of things on the menu (I'm used to the Americanized version of Chinese food), but the waitress was very nice and happily explained what everything was and recommended her favourites.

I tried the Soup Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), Salt and Pepper Chicken, and Hot and Sour Soup. Everything came out very fast and nice and hot! The soup came first, and I was surprised at its portion size (it's rather large for a starter), but tasted very good! I wish it came without the chicken, but the broth was so nice and the veggies were cooked well. 

Next came the soup dumplings. I have never had them before, and they were happy to show me the proper way to eat them! The pork inside was delicious, and the broth and dough were at a great ratio. From what I've seen online though, they had much less broth than other dumplings. 

Lastly, the salt and pepper chicken was a great add on. Though it did off-balance the rest off the meal, their crispiness, juiciness and saltiness would be perfect to go with drinks or to indulge in between friends late at night. 

After my meal, they did not rush me (despite closing time) and were very nice. I had such a great, welcoming experience and plan to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm a young white guy eating by myself in the early afternoon, and I felt like they didn't want me there any longer than necessary. I've had waayyyy better green curries for half the price, and it came with a spring roll that was cold (it wasn't simply \"not-hot\", it was cold). There is far better in Toronto."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, ingredients tasted fresh and were cooked perfectly. The shrimp fried rice and the dumplings were awesome."}
{"text":"Always a great option for small quick bites, decent soup dumplings, average pan fried potstickers, but that's it. 

Don't venture out to their mains, go to the actual Chinese restaurant for things like sweet and sour pork"}
{"text":"Totally under-rated. Their ribs are great, as are their soup dumplings. Eaten here 4-5 times. Wife loves their bubble tea. Service is good, and the setting is clean and modern. Good quality."}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times, this is the first time I encounter a pain-in-the-ass waitress, she,aka Stephanie, said the reason we can't sit at where we want to sit is because that seat is not under my waiter's range yet there is a couple sitting right next to those seats and we are a couple too. My waiter is actually quite nice. Also I am pissed that the quantity is getting smaller and smaller. I will give higher rating only if I see improvements. 

0 star for Stephanie
5 star for our waiter Kui
4 star for the food
9/3=3stars"}
{"text":"Super nice environment , delicious authentic meals . I wish there are more chinese restaurants like this in Toronto"}
{"text":"Shao long bao wasn't that taste than i was expecting but others foods were much tastier so i would go next time too. Service was ok"}
{"text":"Been here many times for lunch and dinner. Good quality of food and reasonable priced, recommend the steamed stuffed bun."}
{"text":"I recommend the Dan Dan noodles, $6.25 it is really filling and hits the spot.  I always grab one to go when i'm in the area.  It even tastes good cold after having it in the fridge.  The staff is always friendly whenever I go."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a snack.  I had the green onion pancake and tea.  Very nicely done. Food quality was good as was the service."}
{"text":"I decided to go to Lee Chen with my family one day after finding it on Yelp. While it is definitely not authentic Asian food, I still give it 5 stars!

Firstly, something that me and my family really appreciated was how wholesome the food was, ESPECIALLY considering that it was Chinese food. I think you all know what I'm talking about when I say Chinese food can often be very artificial. The General Tso chicken did not have a crazy breading to meat ratio, and the other mains were not drowned in MSG-filled sauces.

Next, the decor and overall restaurant was very well-presented, which is always a plus. Maybe I am just so used to the Mom-and-pop Chinese restaurants, but it was a nice change to have sociable staff and a clean washroom, lol.

Overall, a pleasant dining experience. Definitely not the best Chinese food, but you won't go wrong if you turn in here on your lunch break or when you don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Would give it 3.5 stars. Had delivery.  Sesame BBQ chicken dim sum was great as was the pork wrapped in rice.  Sweet and sour chicken was ok. And Singapore noodles wasn't that good.  Would order again and try to replace the second two dishes."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and got to our table in less than 15 minutes. servers were very nice. Everything we had was great but the shrimp curry was out of this world delicious will definitely go back next time I'm in yorkville."}
{"text":"They changed their shrimp chow mein recipe.  It's not as good as before, but it was still good.  Regular size shrimp."}
{"text":"Ho-Lee-Chen!

After a productive day of shopping on Bloor, I was in the mood for some noodles.  Across the street from the reference library I saw a \"We're now open\" sign and a newly renovated restaurant.

This \"Asian Diner\" is the newest addition to Asian eateries in the Yonge-Bloor area and one of the better ones.

The owners and waitstaff are super friendly and immediately greeted and served me.

They offered me a glass of water while I looked through their take-out menu.  The restaurant has only been open for two days and it was pretty quiet.  A lot of people peered curiously into the window.

The restaurant is nicely decorated, dim lit with dark wood, and ample seating.  I liked that the kitchen was open and you can see the food being prepared.

The music was loud and repetitive.  
I wonder if Chinese restaurants use the same CD.  
Probably from the album Exotic Sounds of the Far East.  
I felt like I was trapped in a never-ending OMNI movie.
Anyways...

The menu had a assortment of traditional dishes and more western dishes.  You can order.... sweet potato fries.... or tofu! 

The menu is very similar to Asian Legend and so are the prices.
They had cold peanut noodles($4.99), spicy beef noodles in soup ($8.99), basic dumpling offerings (6 for $5.99), siu mei (4 for $4.59), a variety of fried rices (around 9 bucks), kung pao chicken, general tso, green curry, etc.

They said that their xiao long bao is good.  
I'll have to give it a try next time...
And perhaps the sticky rice roll with dried pork and onion pancake too.

The Shanghai noodles didn't have that weird fake orange color.
The eggplant was not saucy but fresh.
Pan-fried dumplings were surprisingly satisfying.

I was happy with my meal and service and I'm sure I'll be back for several reasons.
* It's not Hue's (Horrific) Kitchen. 
* It's less pretentious than Spring Rolls and about a billion times more authentic.

I hope this place stays around, Yonge-Bloor can use some more Asian flavour!"}
{"text":"Very decent Chinese food, for sure one of the best in Yonge/Bloor area. The dining environment is pretty nice compare to many other Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I have eaten here and got food delivered loads. 

If you are craving a noodle soup, their spicy beef ramen is amazing. 
Their hot and sour soup is really good too. 
Salt and pepper chicken is amazing. 
Their special fried rice was delicious. 

A friend of ours order a noodle with pork, i am not sure of the exact name... but it was quite bland and I could only imagine eating it with lots of other dishes which has flavor."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here on a Monday night during out trip to Toronto. I was overall very content with the the ambience, the food, and friendly staff.

The restaurant is located below ground level, so we probably would have just passed by it had we not been looking for it. Upon entering, I was surprised to see just how large and spacious it is with very simple, but tasteful, decor. The clean and relaxing environment made it very easy for us to get comfortable as soon as we were seated. 

We both started with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Unfortunately, the drink menu was quite limited with only wine and beer, but luckily, I was very content with the wine I chose

In regards to food, we selected the Soup Filled Pork Dumplings, Pan Fried Pork, Shrimp and Garlic Chive Dumplings, and Sparerib Bites in Rice Powder for appetizers. For our entree we chose the Thai Green Curry Chicken to share.

Both the dumplings were FANTASTIC, and the Thai Green Curry was just as good! Between these three dishes, I couldn't decide which I liked the best! The one dish that was a huge disappointment was the Sparerib Bites. We were served a heaping bowl full of bites that looked quite tasty, but after we both consumed the first one, we quickly changed our minds. First of all, they were bone in! In my opinion, a \"bite size\" item that you can just pop in your mouth shouldn't be bone in! If they are going to be, it would have been helpful if it was indicated on the menu. Sadly, it was not. In addition to that, the flavor was really lacking. We were excited to try this unique dish, but it turned out to be our least favorite of the night. We were quick to agree that we wish we hadn't ordered them, and had gotten another side of dumplings instead.

All in all, I would still recommend this spot to anyone craving some hot and spicy Asian food. My suggestions: dumplings are a must to start off the meal, and if you are to get the delicious Green Curry, make sure you order a side of rice to help soak in every last spoonful of the curry (the entree does not come with rice). With these appetizers, this entree, and the great setting, you are sure to have a fun and relaxing experience, with some delicious food!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've tried a lot of the dishes and none of them disappoint. A few favorites: green onion pancake, xiao long bao (sooo good!), and salt & pepper chicken. The service is always quick too. It can get pretty busy, but I've never had to wait."}
{"text":"Mr. H and I went here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. It wasn't too busy and the place has a nice and clean atmosphere. 

We ordered the soup dumplings and the onion pancake to start followed by the Szechuan Fish and BBQ chicken with one side of rice. The one side was more than enough for the two of us after the apps and the fish was the better dish out of the two. I did not like the BBQ Chicken at all, it was way too sweet! The fish too was sweet (not the authentic Szechuan style), however that seems to be who they cater to, people not looking to try the authentic stuff. It's a chain and I never expect greatness from a chain restaurant. I would probably go in if I'm in the area and with someone who can't handle the real stuff but I don't think I'll specifically go to this restaurant. 

It was okay, not bad, just not awesome. :|"}
{"text":"Got dandan mien and xialongbao. Decent flavour, but I personally felt the noodles were too salty and the sauce-to-noodle ratio was too high. Xiaolongbao were great, and the soup was inside the dumplings as promised."}
{"text":"It's a gem here in Toronto CA downtown. You don't have to wait three hours in line for soup dumplings. The food is excellent their soup dumplings only run you about $7 per order and they are delicious. Thin skin, delicate meat and the soup is broth is clear and perfect. We tried the gaui gaui chicken which was different sweet and savory chicken with dressing that is kinda prickly. Good service please give this place a try when you're in the area."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! It's somewhere we can go eat dinner in Toronto downtown area and not have to worry about crowds. However, this restaurant deserves more business than it's getting on a dinner time evening on a Saturday night. Their Xiaolongbao is as good as Din Tai fung and we loved them so much we ordered 4 orders. We had their gaui gaui chicken which is crispy chicken with a sweet and sour dressing very interesting. I'm not sure if I would have it again. I liked their snow pea tip king mushroom dish and I loved their pan fried dumplings too. The service was great! We totally would recommend this place if Din Tai Fung is too busy. I would come back here to try their other foods."}
{"text":"I was too lazy to go to Chinatown or Markham so I searched for a place that offered XLB in the Yorkville area and Lee Chen is pretty much the only one that popped up on yelp.
Ordered some snacks:
- XLB
Not bad for xlb outside chinatown and markham 
- salt & pepper chicken
Meh... It lacked flavour, I had to dip it in the garlic soy sauce
- fried tofu with garlic soy sauce
The tofu was crispy and hot, but it wasn't seasoned so the sauce helped

It is nicely decorated with booths at the front and more group dining at the back. The service was fast and friendly. I would like to come back to try their main entrees."}
{"text":"really good lunch spot. service is usually really fast especially if you're here on a lunch break. I have never had to wait long for food at all. I get one of their business lunch specials usually which comes with a rice, side salad and a spring roll. really good value for what you get. I've had the black pepper beef which was really good, as well as the ginger beef which was also really delicious. I also get their xiao long bao - steamed dumplings which are delicious. The shiu mai aren't that great so i would pass those next time. They're pretty expensive compared to standard dim sum places but worth it for the convenience."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks! My family and I ordered sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, wonton soup, some dumplings, and kung pao chicken. All of it was amazing, nothing too greasy or garlicy, though I do recommend drinking a glass of water before going to bed so you don't wake up in the middle of the night with a dry mouth. Service was a bit slow, and they seemed a little understaffed, but all around an amazing dinner."}
{"text":"Have been coming here quite often these days.  Food is delicious and well prepared...there have been a couple of issues with service but it is good most of the time...and they have the dim sum menu which is also great if you're dining alone and don't want huge plates. The noise level can be quite loud at times especially in the back of the restaurant.  Some of my fav dishes are the pork dumplings, salt and pepper chicken and fried tofu...the spicy dishes have a great kick.  The misses are the noodle dishes...usually quite bland...by they make up for it with their desserts...very tasty.  My go to place when in the area."}
{"text":"4.5 stars really, as I only have one small complaint. 

Food is great here, though I almost always come for a late lunch that usually consists of something off their soup menu. The spicy beef soup is UNREAL! Rich broth, tender and flavourful pieces of beef, not too spicy, bit that's what the chili oil on the table is for. I have no qualms there. 

Service to great too! Now don't get me wrong here, these people are kind and attentive, almost to a fault. It seems like every time I'm here, I'm offered forks instead of chopsticks and I'm constantly being asked if I know how to eat the food (particularly in the dim sum department). I understand they're just trying to be nice, but it's a little embarrassing to be asked if I know how to eat baos or soup dumplings. 

Decor is lovely. Looks like Chinese colonial. Wood, and high quality wood tables. Bathrooms are super clean!"}
{"text":"Most of what we ordered (soup dumplings, hot and sour soup, and black pepper beef with fried noodles) was like any other cheap and cheerful greasy Chinese food. I would much rather go around the corner to Dynasty."}
{"text":"Wonderful Chinese restaurant serving Shanghai Cuisine! I thought this would be a tiny place with mediocre food, but it exceed expectations. The food was authentic and plentiful with great prices. From the moment I walked in, I was wowed by how beautifully decorated, clean and expansive the dining room was.

Service was very pleasant and quick. We came in half an hour before closing. I thought we would be turned away, but the staff was very polite about letting us know that they were closing soon but that they could still serve us. We were gently reminded about getting our order in, last call, and closing our bill without feeling rushed.

The food exceeded my expectations. We got xiaolongbao soup dumplings, pickled greens noodle soup, green onion pancake, and fried potstickers. Everything was delicious and very well priced. The portion sizes were generally good. The noodle soup was massive and a great size for sharing. The only size that seemed a little less than normal were the soup dumplings which came with only six, whereas I usually get ten in an order at other restaurants in the U.S."}
{"text":"The meal was yummy.  The service was ok. The soup was the perfect size but the waiters seemed so rushed for a mediocre crowd. The selection was good."}
{"text":"Came here for work lunch.  Place is huge!! I didn't even notice this place before.  The lunch menu has a lot of options so I was happy.  Couldn't decide on the Ma Po tofu or sweet and sour pork.  Ended up getting the eggplant and spicy pork rice instead.  They have a little dim sum steamer where they display the rice in which was pretty unique.  Most of the lunch specials comes with 1 spring roll and some broccoli on the side.  What was cool is that the rice and the main dish is separated and the main dish is stored in a nest made of deep fried wonton skin.  Food was decent but it took a while to get our food as I expected it to be faster as other Chinese places in the GTA.  We ended up having lunch for 2 hrs"}
{"text":"Way overpriced, and the food is average at best.  Doesn't taste bad, but definitely not worth the price.  Go to Chinatown and there are cheaper and better ones.  Waiters are not that attentive.  I was in that area and craving Chinese food, but I knew I'd come out shocked by the unmatching price and food quality.  Will try to avoid next time"}
{"text":"Friend recommended and we decided to give it a shot. Xiaolongbao were delicious, but that day all dishes came in an over-salted way which my friend found very unusual. 
Other than the salty issue, everything was great."}
{"text":"Nice place, cozy decor. The service was a touch slow, but pleasant enough! Food wise the kung pao chicken was okay, the chicken wasn't as crispy as I'd like and the flavour was a little too mellow. The pork, shrimp, and chive dumplings were pretty tasty though, I liked these. But oh my god the pork belly bao was amaaaazing!! Next time I'd come here just for a bunch of these! Of note, I came here hoping for dim sum, as this is what I had searched prior to going. But it didn't seem like they had much choice? Everything seemed more like a normal, singular meal price? But this may be my inexperience speaking, I've never done dim sum! Also of note, I asked for a bubble tea after seeing the guy next to me enjoying one. But I was told they were out of bubbles. I find that pretty hard to believe given the guy beside me receiving one just moments before!"}
{"text":"As I really like this restaurant, I took my best friend who was visiting me from Barrie yesterday. Their customer service was great as always, however I have to say some of their food were not as good as before...I was a bit disappointed....We ordered their signature pork soup dumplings, deep fried vegetable spring rolls and chow mein. 

1. Pork soup dumplings were so good as always. You should not miss this! 
2. Deep fried vegetable spring rolls - one of my disappointments...it was very salty and peppery. I could not taste the flavour of vegetables. 
3. Chow mein - my biggest disappointment...no flavour (too plain) and too oily :(  

I had always enjoyed their food (Everything was good before) so I feel like their main chef(s) was/were changed or it happened just yesterday? (I hope so!)  I wanted to write my honest feedback here for them to improve their food as I still want to come back!"}
{"text":"A little over priced, but its in a premium area located one block  above the yonge and bloor intersection.

I've been here once and it was really some great asian food. I got the pork belly steamed bao and it was probably the best steamed bao i've ever had. The meat melts in your mouth. I also had some shrimp and noodles which was very good too. 

I would go there again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"My first encounter was delivery to the office on a late work night, and I wasn't immediately impressed with my Shanghai noodles. The noodles were chewy and not your average udon in disguise, but delivery meant everything was tangled and squished into the packed (reuseable!) takeout box. Fortunately the noodles weren't spicy, so at least it meant I had plenty to spare for lunch the next day.

My second visit was lunch on a slow Friday at work. This time I opted to dine in, and the experience was quite different. The front of the store worried me about whether there would be seating available, but I was happy to find the store to be quite deep and there was about 50-60 seats in total. The lunchtime wait was still something, particularly because there was a walk-in of a 15-person party that they couldn't turn down. Have some patience or opt to try your luck elsewhere, though the wait was probably no more than 30 minutes for a party of two at 1:00pm.

I ordered the pork meatballs with noodle soup, it sounded promising and pork meatballs are a classic northern dish. The meatballs came served on the side with lots of sauce, and the noodle bowl was a good portion. The soup was just a simple broth, but the meatball sauce provided more than enough flavour. I was very happy with the texture of the noodles - chewy and fresh, and didn't get mushy at all to the very end of my meal. For under $15 this was great quality for price, and I have to agree it had a fairly authentic flavour for where Lee Chen's is located.

Service does require you to do some flagging, but the lunchtime rush meant many servers will drop by to ensure you're moving along with your visit in a timely manner - making sure you order as soon as you are ready, asking if you need anything else, asking if all the food has arrived, etc. Don't hang out for too long, and try not to have a long catch-up lunch session here - it'll be loud anyways.

Overall, I had no complaints and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service - definitely revisiting when I have the time!"}
{"text":"It was nice to discover that a new Asian restaurant had opened up close to where I live. I checked out the menu online and was excited to see they had \"xiao long bao\" (soup dumplings) - not easy to find in the downtown core. I visited on a Sunday night with my boyfriend. The restaurant is situated underground along King West and was a lot bigger than I expected. The Asian decor is relatively elaborate. Most of the tables were empty that night and  we were one of the few diners inside. We did, however, see many food delivery couriers come in and out to pick up food throughout the time we were there!

The food itself was decent. We ordered the xiao long bao, fried pork dumplings, salt and pepper chicken, and beef noodles. The xiao long bao were well-made and filled with a good amount of soup inside. The fried pork dumplings were good too. The fried salt and pepper chicken was just average and we likely won't order this again. The beef noodles were delicious - flavourful soup, generous amounts of beef, and tasty noodles. We also shared a milk bubble tea - came in a large glass and was pretty good!

Overall, we wouldn't hesitate to come back and order some of the same things again."}
{"text":"This place has a really nice staff, the food is freshly made by their own chefs, and the decor and ambience is great.

I went there with some Asian friends and they said that it is not just delicious, but very authentic.

Will go there many more times."}
{"text":"a little bit pricey. 
the interior is clean and chic
my friend and I ordered the soup dumplings, house soup rice cake and shrimp lettuce wrap.
The soup dumplings have thin skins and are juicy inside. They are delicious, but of course, not as good as those served at Joe's Shanghai(nyc).
the house soup rice cake really reminds me of China. The taste of home, finally! (Although it is over priced($11.95). )I will definitely go back for more.
The shrimp lettuce wrap has a crispy and refreshing taste with cubed carrots and celery.
In a word, Lee Chen is truly Chinese !"}
{"text":"I ordered the delivery and it was awesome!!!! It tastes better than some other Chinese restaurants feels like home omg."}
{"text":"Nice quick lunch with co-workers, I like that they had set \"business\" menus and took our order efficiently. You simply write your order up on paper and the waitress collects it. Very nice decor inside, fried wonton bowl was a nice/tasty touch, rice came extra hot, everything tasted fresh. The salad was so flavourful. 

I got the kung pao fish ($12.95) which had a lot of chilies in it...wasn't as spicy as it looked. The spring roll seemed to have meat in it but the waitress verbally assured me it was vegetarian.

The only weird thing about this place that we noticed is that if you upgrade to fried rice its just a larger white rice with small niblets of corn... If someone didn't want white rice I'd definitely recommend upgrading to the chow mein which looked a lot better!"}
{"text":"Amazing fresh, fast, and delicious Dim Sum for lunch - I recommend the soup dumplings!"}
{"text":"Solid Solid 3.5 Stars...

We came here last night for a varied selection of dishes that aren't common in some of the older Chinatown restaurants that we usually frequent. Lee Chen specializes in Shanghai Cuisine, which I understand is quite different then the Cantonese restaurants in Chinatown.  We ordered lots of appetizers, Dan Dan Noodles, Green Scallion Pancakes and Shanghai style soup dumplings. All were quite good. We last had Soup dumplings in New York and we were really keen to try them again. They were good, not too salty, with a nice bite of Wonton Soup Flavour inside each one. The Scallion Pancakes and Dan Dan was also quite good. 

All the apps were quite filling so we only had one main, Shanghai Rice Cakes with Chicken. The Rice Cakes had a really gluttonous appearance and texture but were quite nicely spiced and very very filling. Pretty good food all around."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now for the Business Lunch and did the same thing both times...the Black Pepper Beef. The food itself is actually really good, the service is decent but not overly spectacular but that is fine as I dont worry myself too much about the service side of things. The one thing that was disappointing is I really wanted to try the Szechuan but they dont do it with beef or chicken (my preferred options) so there is no customization there. Sometimes that can be an indication of pre-prepared/frozen items or just sticking to what they feel is best.

Overall, I would say this place is worth a try if you are in the area especially for lunch. And I would say the black pepper beef is worth a go."}
{"text":"Not very authentic Chinese food but this is the best Chinese restaurant you can go in the financial district."}
{"text":"Northen Chinese food on the edge of Yorkville. Seems like a fast-paced, \"fast food\" joint. Nice Chinese style decor inside. Can get busy be prepared to share tables. 

Service was pretty good, even though we saw that they forgot one order next to us and one of the dishes we ordered as well. Seems like during busy times they need to improve their system a bit. Food was decent. We ordered a Shanghai fried noodle, the portion was on the small side ($11.95) and the noodle was a flat noodle not the type we were used to. It tasted okay, but I thought it lacked the usual flavour. I also ordered a Shredded chicken and green been noodles, it's a cold platter and it's supposed to be an appetizer. But it didn't come until after we were almost finished the noodles and of course we had to remind them that we were missing a dish. But it was tasty and reasonable portion for the price of $6.25. 

This is a good place to go to if you are in the area and if you are craving Chinese food, just be aware that they might forget your order once in a while."}
{"text":"When the store first open, i thought it was just like a regular western style Chinese food.
However, after i try different things from the restaurant knew i was wrong. This place is surprisingly good in terms of the food quality and flavor. It is fresh and flavorful. If you want to try some traditional Chinese food with traditional flavor, you have to go there.   
The appetizer, cold platter and specialty are awesome! My favorite dishes are soup dumplings, dandan noodles, spicy beef tendon, braised bamboo shoots, fiery wonton, spicy beef soup noodles and its fried rice. 
The downside of this place is $$$. It is quite pricy compared to other Chinese/Asian restaurant. I guess mainly due to the location as well as the decoration. It is more like a high quality Asia food place. 
Also, their spicy food is really spicy, but it tastes very good."}
{"text":"Was walking at Yorkville and walk pass and wanted to try this place out. Inside was nice and confrotable with and Asian dark wooden design. 

Servers were nice.  We ordered the siu long bao. It was great the thin wrap, inside soup and meat was well balance not salty and not too oily.

We also ordered sweet warm soy bean. It was medium  warmth. Not that sweet maybe just a very little sweetness.

Green onion pancakes are one of my favorite, at Lee I found that the pancake was had a nice crunch to it but needed more green onion to bring out the flavor more

The green onion soy sauce oil noodle. It was kinda small would of been a bit more better with more noodle. Kinda salty from the soy sauce. 

Noodle with the meatballs. Not too bad, the noodle in soup was great. Soup did not taste salty at all. The meat ball was suppppper soft. Once you bite into it it melts in your mouth.

Overall nice service nice decor and food was nice would come back for the siu long bao."}
{"text":"I was eager to find a reasonable (and Asian) dining option in the Yorkville area when I shop @ anthro (quite regularly). *sigh*

So i was excited to see Lee Chen on the Yorkville radar. 

I came here for lunch today; it's steps from the Bloor TTC and the restaurant is huge. 
Contemporary Asian Teahouse is the best way to describe it. 
The prices here are reasonable, albeit higher than the usual Chinatown fare; but this ain't Chinatown folks...it's the borderline snooty Yorkville. 

Had the Shanghai Dumplings (xiao long bao) steamed in a bamboo basket, and freshly made to order. The dumplings were quite delicious; delicate skin, savory filling with a drop of soup in the dumpling. 

I also had the Shanghai Spicy Stewed Beef Noodles. I dumped a ton of chili in the soup coz i like it extra spicy...and it was delish. 
The noodles tasted handmade, the soup was yummy and the generous pieces of beef were tender and flavorful. 
The bowl of noodles was Huge. 

Service was good; efficient, friendly, nice. 
I'd come back for lunch with friends to try various dishes. 
Highly recommend for the area."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the soup dumplings! The shell were thin and delicate, the filling had the right amount of soup and meat. Really enjoyed the dumplings! 

My friend and I also ordered from the lunch specials, ginger beef and general tsao chicken... Presentation was nice but not so practical to actually eat. These dishes weren't as tasty as the dumplings. I would come back and only have the soup dumplings!!"}
{"text":"For Chinese Food, their food selection is on the simpler side but the restaurant is clean, spacious and good for a larger group. Food was pretty good. Considering it's on yonge-bloor, good enough for me"}
{"text":"From the outside, it doesn't look like a very big place, but once you walk in, you'll see that it's very spacious inside.

Everything looks pretty clean. Washrooms are clean. They've even got small trays of grass in the washrooms which is something you don't see often. Some of the decor is kind of interesting to say the least...

* * *

We came with a group of 8, and received 5 menus. Well, other chinese places usually just give you 2 menus for a group of 8 so this isn't so bad. It's also a pretty expensive-looking menu compared to sheets of laminated paper with string bindings.

Our server briefly walked us through the menu.

All sorts of dishes that you would expect at a chinese restaurant: veggie, meats, noodle soups, fried rice/noodle. There are some dimsum dishes as well if you'd like to try some of those on the side.

At the back of the menu there are lunch combos that come with white rice, spring roll, and a salad. You can substitute the rice for brown rice, fried rice, or chow mein for an extra $1.

5 different bubble teas are available. For dessert you can order passion fruit custard, fried sesame balls, or tang yuan.

* * *

You don't get free tea. It comes as a drink order for $2.50.
However, they give you this massive thermos with a tea bag, which is good for 3 or 4 people. 

The servers will check up on you from time to time, seeing if you would like re-fills on any beverages. Not sure if they charge extra for re-fills.

* * *

I ordered the \"Crystal pork belly\" lunch combo, black milk tea with tapioca, and fried sesame balls. The pork belly dish comes with 5 pieces of pork belly inside an edible bowl along with the combo items. It was very tender and juicy, and the soy sauce/sugar flavor wasn't too overpowering. 

The bubble tea was just ok. It comes in a mug and is about the size of a large cup from other bubble tea places.

I liked the fried sesame balls. The inside was quite chewy, with a somewhat crisp exterior.

It's a nice place to go if you're looking for a chinese restaurant in downtown core."}
{"text":"This was a disappointing experience. I came here for lunch with 3 friends. From a service perspective, it was a mess. One friend's entree came out in about 4 minutes (not sure how fried rice can be prepared that quickly), and then the other dishes started to arrive (all staggered) over the next 5-10 minutes. What's the point of putting one dish on the table? They should just hold off until most of the dishes can be served. This isn't a fast food restaurant. Worse yet, the two appetizers we ordered came AFTER the entrees had arrived. 

Food was very mediocre. I ordered Beef and Broccoli with a side of white rice, and for $20 I expected more beef. I basically received a plate of broccoli and mushrooms. The vegetable dumplings we had didn't taste all that great.

I'm not sure why this place was busy when we arrived. There are so many better Asian places in the area. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Our waitress Amy has a huge attitude problem!!! She seems like she is in charge. but seriously girl? U don't even know the menu! We ask for her recommendation btw two dishes, she told us that she haven't try it she wouldn't know.  



As a real shanghainese, I have to say the skin of the soup dumpling(xiaolong Bao) is very good, but man too much MSG in the fillings!! And everything else we ordered had too much salt in it! Especially the steamed vegetable dumplings, they HAVE to be light and fresh so you can taste the freshness of the veggies wrapped inside. But there were just too much salt in it  that gave me a headache after eating too!! 




horrible service and way too much salt in the food. Will never return again!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night because of the yelp reviews and was not disappointed.   Had the spicy beef soup and fried dumplings and shared some other appetizers.  We will definitely return when in the Yonge/Bloor area."}
{"text":"Looks great, tastes great. 

The atmosphere is a step above your usual Chinese restaurant. It's all dark wood and low lighting. The menu has a good mix of traditional Chinese dishes and Canadian-style dishes. 

The food was really great. To be fair, I wasn't expecting much, as I kind of have a bias against Chinese food in non-Chinese neighbourhoods. I was delightfully surprised. The soup-filled dumplings, though small, were very delicious, as were the pan-fried dumplings. The fried rice was really good, with lots of plump shrimp. What really stood out to me was the Sliced Pork Belly with Garlic Purée. Tender-crunchy slivers of pork belly in a spicy, garlicky sauce, with cooling cucumbers. I could have eaten the whole plate. The chow mien and green onion pancake were also good.

Service was quick and very friendly. This is a great spot. Definitely get a bunch of things to share."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, spacious and clean washrooms. Good tea.
Service is polite but very slow at times. The food is quite below average.

Appetizers:
Almond fish - thin pieces of fish battered with almond flakes, pretty good, it was the best dish out of all of them.

Fiery Wontons - very small wontons with little filling, the sauce wasn't spicy at all. By small, I mean very small, about 1/3 the size of wontons you could get at any restaurant in Chinatown.

Main Dishes:
Kung Pao Chicken - sauce was too salty. Very little chicken pieces! Mostly veggies and onions. For $13 it wouldn't have hurt to put in a bit more meat in the dish.

Chow Mein - meh. Greasy. Nothing stands out about it. Also a small portion for the price you pay for.

Overall, average tastes, small portions, and high prices but this is in the Yorkville area so that's probably why. Probably wouldn't come here again. Spent over $40 and my boyfriend and I were still quite hungry afterwards!"}
{"text":"I would give 3 n 1/2 stars for this place for the ambiance and a clean Asian restaurant. I do hope they maintain this way until next time we come back. I enjoy the foods we ordered... 

Noodles taste good. Popcorn chicken is awesome... I do wish it was a bigger portion though. Pulled pork bun was okay... I don't recommend it due to small portion and it was salty for the amount of bun they included (2). Very juice 'xiao long bao' ordered 2 which my kids loved it and they wanted more.

The service in general was good. Although the they missed my order and had to wait for the missing order when we were almost done. I will definitely go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Very clean and beautiful space. Of course, that's why it's a bit pricier.  I've had a lot of dim sum that's crowded or loud or cheap or greasy or too authentic with the dirty plates greeting me as I entered. This was a perfect place for a sophisticated authentic, well balanced flavorful meal. Great intro for newbie dim sum goers. Try to scallion pancakes, dan dan noodles, and of course, fantastic xiao long bao."}
{"text":"Delicious xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and chong yao beng (green onion pancakes) as well as many of the mains (favourites are Thai green curry chicken spaghetti and Wuxi spare ribs).  The restaurant is also very jook sing (Canadian-born Chinese) friendly as they don't judge us just because we are of Chinese descent and can't read the language (too well).  There are many places - especially those who have that \"other\" menu (in Chinese only) who find us a bit...odd (because we're westerners, culturally speaking but aren't of European descent).  One point of criticism:  Many of the items list Shanghainese bok choy on the menu (e.g. Wuxi spare ribs), but are, in reality, served with gai lan.  Shouldn't they therefore edit the menu to reflect the change?"}
{"text":"Prime location, clean decor and great service. Expensive for chinese food, but on par with the food prices in the financial district.

The food was very well presented, and I was pleasantly surprised by the taste. Especially the panfried shrimp and pork dumplings - I was delighted to bite into a whole shrimp in the dumpling (on top of the pork), rather than diced up shrimp mixed in with the pork.

The lunch special is a pretty good deal as it comes with a spring roll and salad. The sweet and sour pork was okay, maybe a bit too saucy. The spring roll was awesome. 

Overall, a good dining experience!"}
{"text":"The service was very quick and attentive. The prices are reasonable for the area. We ordered the general tsos and Kung pao chicken, neither was anything to write home about, but it satisfied our hunger."}
{"text":"Lee Chen undoubtedly makes much of their dough on the unfailing lunch hour flow from the surrounding office buildings. Their \"Business Lunch\" menu ($11-14, extra for options) capitalizes on it, with an array of pre-made meals that include:

- a small bowl-size portion of one of their popular dishes - Kung Pao, General Tso, sweet and sour, Szechuan, green curry, etc. (I go for shrimp or fish)
- side of white rice
- three pieces of canned fruit à la Chef Del Monte
- a veggie spring roll
- a literal sample of the world's least Asian salad (two pieces of broccoli in mayo), which they refer to as \"seasonal greens\" because it's always nice to have a lil' laugh to start off your meal.

As noted by all the previous reviews, it's overpriced. But the food is tasty and the clean, up-ish-scale decor works well for...well, a Business Lunch (though you should be prepared to take a number and wait in the cramped doorway if you show up during the rush). If it's just value and \"Chinatown\" ambiance you're looking for, Dumpling Queen down the street might be more suitable for you.

BEVERAGE ALERT: For all my soulmates (i.e. natural ginger beer aficionados) out there, they have bottles of Bruce Cost Ginger Ale! *Jay-Z hands emoji*"}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated, clean, friendly staff, and of course - great food!! I absolutely loooooved the scallion noodles. It really reminded me of Asia."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday night. They seated us right away and we got a little booth. The menu is expansive so you really have a ton of choices to suit your tastes at the time. I went with the pork belly bao to start followed by the pan fried pork dumplings. A double dosage of pork, I know, but it was worth the health splurge. The pork belly bao was better than I've had anywhere else. I liked being able to put it together and add as much sauce as I'd like. The dumplings following were also delicious. I wouldn't call them the best dumplings I've ever had but they still got the job done. My friend got a similar mix for their meal and they agreed that the pork belly bao was the best. 

This place seats a lot of people so it was quite busy and from the time we sat down, there were multiple people that came in and out. The food came out really quickly but I didn't feel rushed to leave which I appreciated. The restaurant was very clean and the service was great. We really enjoyed our meal and I would recommend this place if you're looking for this type of food and want quick service in a comfortable environment."}
{"text":"Pros:
1.  Authentic Mainland Chinese food.  My Chinese in-laws were quite satisfied with the food.
2.  Depending on what you order the quality ranged from 'ok' to 'excellent'.  Not one of the dishes ordered was sub-par
3.  Some Canadian-Chinese wait staff made it easy to communicate and ask questions about the more hardcore items in English.
4.  Ambiance/Decor is excellent
5.  They accept Visa
6.  Staff, overall, were very courteous and friendly.

Cons:
1.  Portion size for the \"Specialties\" like xiao long bao, shao mai, green onion pancake, soya bean curd soup were extremely small compared to Asian Legend.  The soya bean curd soup was only 1/3 the size of what you get at Asian Legend.  The others as well.
2.  Price is expensive.  Seriously expensive if you compare the cost of dishes to Asian Legend.  Quite unbelievable actually.  However, keep in mind they are right at the corner of Yonge and Bloor, I'm sure rent is insane.  But, this is one draw back...why go here when you can go somewhere else for cheaper food with larger portions that tastes just as good? Asian Legend wins."}
{"text":"Asian Bistro disappointed me. The dishes are priced far beyond their value and you leave feeling like you ate a pound of salt. My dining partner and I had pork soup dumplings, shrimp and chicken steamed siu Mai, and crispy pork belly.

The dumplings were uninspiring and bland. The soup wasn't as flavourful as it should have been and the texture of the dough was plasticky. The pork belly was incredibly salty, although nice and chewy. The shrimp/chicken steamed siu Mai left no impression, which I suppose is better than a negative one,

Service is fine. Decor is fine. Atmosphere is what you'd expect. For quite sub par Chinese food, the price will make you cringe. Will not return."}
{"text":"I agree with Christian P. I myself also noticed the quality of food is going downhill. They used to use sushi rice, now they just use those cheap long grain rice....very disappointing.."}
{"text":"Went for brunch here last Sunday and it really wasn't set up for a traditional 'brunch', but, no matter!  The food was delicious and tasted 'authentic'.  Everything was presented well, and I felt satiated upon exit.  The bill for four of us came to less than $100.  

My only gripe would be that they open at 11:30am on the weekend - I think they should open earlier and serve a full dim sum menu - I'm sure many would come."}
{"text":"Decent food, fair pricing and great location for Chinese food in the heart of the city."}
{"text":"2.5/5 since my standards for Asian food are high.  When comparing the food quality with what you get up Markham, this place isn't that great and is over priced.  But considering there aren't much competition for this type of food around downtown, it's okay.  I got the Kung pow chicken with fried rice for an extra $1.  Skip the fried rice cause from the picture, is quite sad.  The Kung pow chicken isn't too bad.  The soup dumpling is average and the pot sticker is okay.  You know it's westernized Chinese food when they give you fortune cookies..."}
{"text":"I ordered two noodle soups to go on a busy evening. They were not packaged properly, and the paper bag broke as I was crossing Yonge Street- the noodle soups were lost forever. When I returned to the store, I did not have to ask twice- the owner rushed out to apologize profusely and I was back out with new dishes within 10 minutes. I would give 4 stars for the food and 5+ stars for the service."}
{"text":"I started a new job in the yonge and bloor area, so naturally I searched the area to find good dives in the area that serve a quick lunch. I met up with a few friends at Lee Chen after reading their reviews. They are very time conscientious which is GREAT when you only have a half hour for lunch. I ordered the shangai fried noodle. I was told that they only had egg noodle or rice noodle that day. I opted for the egg noodle when the waitress informed me that this was the thicker noodle. Of course the substitution was not what I had expected. Being the good sport I am, I ate it anyway. We all ended up sharing our meals. A friend of mine had the sweet and sour chicken and the shrimp dumplings which were good. We did have to remind the waitress several times, that we ordered a side of rice with one of the dishes. The food is overall good but a bit all over the place with the service. Definitely recommend this place for a quick lunch and NOT a dinner!"}
{"text":"I bought a coupon for this place as I've never had the mandarin style soup dumplings.  
I went with a friend who has tried them so he could tell me what he thinks.
We ordered some snow pea shoots with king mushrooms, pork ribs (can't remember the sauce), dan dan noodles in peanut sauce, shanghai? style rice cakes.  I think that's it.
Now the dumplings were smaller (my friend said ) than he's used to.  However, he liked that the wrappers were thinner as well.  So overall he thought they were very tasty.  I thought that they were a bit shy in the filling as I was thinking i would be more in them but it was my first time.
The ribs were okay.  My friend like them.
The snow peas shoot were fresh and nicely done. (cantonese style -garlic sauce)
the dan dan noodles were tasty and spicy though I think a few shredded vegetables would had added to the dish.
The stir fry rice cakes my friend thought were heavy.  They are, I've had them as you can buy them in the korean grocery store (frozen section) and I've used them in soups, stir fries and yes they are heavy but I like them,.

Service is decent.  
Atmosphere is very nice.  They did a great job as it was cozy in there.

I would go back if I'm in the neighbourhood.  My friend lives nearby so he plans on going back when he wants chinese food."}
{"text":"This is somewhat a Shanghainese restaurant. 
Small soup filled buns are something you must try and order! Even though my friend from Shanghai told me it would be more authentic if it contains more soup in the bun, we both agree that it tasted really good. 
Wuxi ribs is surprisingly good. Ribs are perfectly cooked, super juicy and tender. 
We also ordered bamboo shoot, sautéed string beans, fried rice and Szechuan fish. These dishes are just on an okay level. By the way, Szechuan fish does not have a strong spicy flavour. It's more like a mix of sweet and mild spicy. To be frank, I think fish fillet or tilapia doesn't taste as good as fish itself (sometimes with fish bones). But I'm sure it's very clean and convenient to eat fish fillet. So if you are not a Chinese, I think you will like this fish. But if you are looking for an authentic Chinese fish dish, this is not the one you are looking for.  
Overall, very good Chinese restaurant nearby St Andrew subway station."}
{"text":"Not really sure who this is even targeted at. My Asian friends all thought it tasted bad and I thought it tasted even worse.  At least the vibe/décor is tolerable."}
{"text":"You know what? See my previous review but I think I was too harsh on them before.  Their presentation is good, they are consistent and have good service. It's no Congee Queen but probably best Chinese in the area"}
{"text":"Pretty good for uber eats Chinese food. I got the chicken in black bean, white rice ots, and Shanghai noodles. 
The black bean was great, not too salty, the veggies was alot vs chicken ratio. 
The Shanghai noodles I didn't love. It was bland not much flavor going on, deadish in a sense. Not alot of cabbage, lots of big pieces of green onion."}
{"text":"Came here on two occasions, both times were very good! Two words to describe their food style is clean and refreshing (two words you'll see often in the next two paragraphs haha). 

We've tried the peanut sesame noodles with chicken and julienned carrots and cucumbers. So refreshing, it's one of my favourite dishes here. The peanut sesame sauce is perf . The only complaint we have is the portion for the price, since it was really small and slightly pricey for an appetizer.
We also tried the Xiao Long Bao (soup dumpling) and they were also good, but not outstanding. I liked the vinegar sauce that came with it though.

For mains, we tried the fried rice with pork and shrimp, and that was also one of my favourites - it tastes so clean and comforting at the same time. The sliced pork belly with black bean sauce and a heap of julienned cucumbers was also so refreshing, pork belly was not greasy and not fatty. Second time we tried a deep fried pork dish, also very good.

The prices are very slightly on the high side, like $15 - $20 for a main, but considering the location and the service it's reasonable. Service is attentive, interior decor is cozy, modern and clean. I'll definitely be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch with some friends. The restaurant looks fancy and traditional inside. My friends recommended the Spicy Beef Soup Noodle. The broth was good but wasn't spicy enough, so had to add a bit of chilli oil sauce. The noodles were thin and curvy, which are rare to found elsewhere. The beef was tendered but cut averagely small which I would prefer to be a bit bigger. There were 2 pieces of Chinese cabbage and some pickled vegetable on the side.  Overall it was a good meal."}
{"text":"We were here for early dinner on Saturday because our friends picked this place. We tried their dishes 4 years ago when they just opened, before we moved away from downtown. 
The service was nice. Decor was nice.

We ordered a lot. Presentation was nice, and taste wise was average. Pork belly was cooked through, tender and nice color, however it tasted too salty. The meat balls contains too much flour,and too much of chopped gingers. The almond fish was too thin. 
Cold noodle tasted okay, but I think they used some mayo instead of sesame paste.
Steamed buns was average.
Rice cake was good.
Might come back next time when our friends come and visit us again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch the other day and was impressed. 
Myself and 2 co-workers all enjoyed our selections from the business lunch menu (kung pao chicken, black bean beef, or szechuan shrimp) which comes along with a choice of rice or fried noodles. It came to just under $40 after tax before tip. 

Service was pretty good, food was totally enjoyable, and the interior/ambience was perfect for the business casual lunch vibe. It's officially now one of my favourite restaurants in the Yonge and Bloor area."}
{"text":"Lee Chen has become one of my favorite staples in the neighborhood for Chinese food. I come here mainly for the soup dumplings, which are absolutely delicious and satisfies my soup dumpling cravings without having to drive all the way out to BFE for DTF (that's ButtF***Egypt -- aka Markham -- and Ding Tai Fung, if you're not acronymically inclined). The dumplings are small, bite-sized, and filled with porky broth and meaty filling. It's like having an inside-out wonton soup. :) So nom-tastic.

The rest of the menu is good, but not as good as the soup dumplings. The siu mai is large and meaty, and the Lee Chen Fried Rice is fresh and filling. The black bean beef is a bit too salty for my taste, though. I keep wanting to try the Wuxi spareribs, but every time I go to Lee Chen, I stuff too many of the soup dumplings in my face-hole and then unfortunately get too full to order spareribs! (First world problems!)

Service has always been great at Lee Chen. Attentive, but never annoying. I just realized while I was writing this review that they also deliver. Yay!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! The atmosphere and service is even better. I will be coming again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden gem.

For the record, I don't really enjoy Mainland Chinese food, with a few notable exceptions (I've been to China many times, so I can say I've tried enough Chinese food), but this place was a real hit.

I was entertaining out of town guests, who really wanted Chinese, and while they were drooling, I was decidedly miserable, until I've started eating - wow is the only thing I can say.

Combined with great service, and endless attention, this place is a definite repeat."}
{"text":"Surprised I ended up here for a weekday lunch... but my 2 co-workers chose it while I was parking. Boy was I glad! Brown rice and black bean chicken? Unheard of! The presentation was gorgeous with some edamame beans and the rice was in a cute little tiny steamer!

The spring roll was a spring roll...meh

The pan fried veggie dumplings were a bit doughy... not the best and took 15 minutes to make so i expected better.

Next time i'll have to try their soup dumplings...

Service was great!"}
{"text":"More like a three-and-half-stars place for me.

A neat place to enjoy Chinese food downtown without having to head to Chinatown. The restaurant is clean, and the decor is modern. The ambiance of the dinning room is comfortable and unhurried, which makes the establishment a relatively rare-find among Asian restaurants. While some may appreciate the Chinese-language pop music from the 80s and early 90s playing in the background, I find it distracting and increasingly irritating over the course of the dinner. The waitstaff are generally quite friendly. Food sometimes is on the blend side, although there's nothing that a bit of soy sauce can't cure. By the same token, their traditional Chinese desert is not overly sweet, which actually makes it quite delicious."}
{"text":"On a cold winter day, my friends and I came here to enjoy some delicious dumplings. I always seem to past by this place but have never been here until now so I was quite excited to try this place. We came here around noon for lunch and it wasn't too busy when we arrived. Located on King Street and known for their lunch specials, it does get quite busy here despite being a fairly large restaurant with plenty of seating. My friends and I ordered a bunch of both fried and steamed dumplings ranging from $6.99 to $7.99 you get about 6-8 dumplings with each order which is a pretty good deal. Our order came out pretty quickly. We ordered the soup dumplings, steamed vegetable dumpling, fried pork dumpling, fried pork and shrimp dumpling and the green onion pancake. Dishes were great. I especially loved the soup dumplings- nice size and very flavourful. The fried dumplings were cooked very nicely. You can't go wrong with the classic fried pork dumplings. However, the steamed vegetable dumplings didn't taste great at all. I've had better vegetable. Service was good and staff were friendly. Overall, a pretty good place to get dumplings and other Asian dishes. Prices are pretty reasonable. Will definitely recommend to others and come back again for delicious soup dumplings!!"}
{"text":"I came in on a whim and only ordered two items - the xiao long bao and the scallion pancakes. They were good but not like, outstandingly good. Service was fast and friendly for an Asian restaurant. I would go back again but with more people so I can try out more things and not look like a pig eating so many different items."}
{"text":"I didn't think you could find soup dumplings in Toronto, but recently found a few spots... All of which were OK, but not great. That is - until I found this place. We ordered 3 orders of the Xiao Long bao, scallion noodles, pan fried dumplings and spare ribs in rice powder. All amazing. Most especially the soup dumplings and scallion noodles. 

This is the real deal. So glad this place exists. I would go as far as saying it's as good as some of the great dumpling places I've been to in Shanghai. 

It's a nice restaurant, service is great, food is spot on. This is a great restaurant to have real Chinese food. If you've been to Shanghai and loved the food, this will fill the void."}
{"text":"Tea is an extra $2.50 which they don't tell you until you get your bill, and they don't mention it when they ask what you want to drink in the beginning. Xiao long baos are good but too small. Pan fried dumplings are crispy but not juicy enough inside. Pork belly baos are delicious, but the orange sauce is a bit too overwhelming, covering the goodness of the pork belly. Overall pretty pricey, but I guess that's how it works in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Nothing really stands out about Lee Chen Asian Bistro. Their food is okay, nothing special, and they are a little more pricey on a dish by dish basis than the average Asian restaurant. Tried the Xiaolongbao and shu mai, both were below the normal dim sum standards. Also had a rice dish, noodle dish, and chicken dish which were not too memorable. Decor is nice, the actual restaurant is tucked away sort-of underground. Service was a tad slow. Overall was  okay but don't think I would go again."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the lunch here. This place is huge and so are the portions!

My friend commented that it was the \"Asian Pickle Barrel\" because the menu was so extensive! It's actually much better than that. I had a green chili shrimp and it was very good. The calamari appetizer is better than good - the Asian 5 spice kicked it up a notch to excellent!

Service was a little off - we didn't get our food in the traditional order - drinks, appetizers, entrees. In fact, the appetizers came last. It also took forever to get the bill - we asked at least 3 times.

Still, despite the service, the food was really good, and there was more than enough. I'll likely return."}
{"text":"Love dining here, we really need more spots like this in downtown Toronto. I find Chinese food is typically not served in nicer establishments with good service. I always take my friends who aren't necessarily familiar with Chinese cuisine and it's always a hit.

I ALWAYS get the soup dumplings here, I'm glad I moved offices because my wallet would hurt everytime I come here for lunch and order them. They are addicting and you will crave them. Tip: put a drop of chilli oil on the soup dumpling and eat them whole.

I've tried quite a few other items and they're all very good. Even a dish like \"braised eggplant\" (which might not sound appetizing at first, but it's amazing). The lunch menu is very filling, you won't need to order anything else on top of it. For dinner, the plates are usually shareables for the table.
Only thing I dislike about this place is the prices.... I used to live up north and would frequent North York/Markham/Richmond Hill for Chinese cuisine of the same quality and they weren't this expensive. In Chinatown you can probably find the same dish at half the price as well, however I personally haven't found a spot that I like more than Lee Chen in Chinatown."}
{"text":"This is a very good resto. Excellent hot and sour soup, though without shrimp, good dimsum, and very fine Szechuan shrimp. The service is prompt, the prices a bit higher than in the Chinatowns, but worth it if you are in Yonge and Bloor area."}
{"text":"I just ordered food from here online and I tried the general Tao's, chow mein, beef spring rolls and wonton soup. The general Tao's was a bit saucy and not tasty as I thought it would be. The chow mein is a bit salty for my liking and considering the price it's definitely not worth it. It taste like those noodles you get from Manchu Wok/Asian fast food chains you find in a shopping mall. The spring rolls are like seasoned taco meat in a fried roll. The wonton soup was ok. 

I doubt I would ever order here again and since I always check reviews of restaurants, I just wanted you guys to know."}
{"text":"Other reviews lead me here and I was pleasantly surprised. Very nice environment, staff and especially the food. Only here for 48 hours but if I lived in the area this place would defiantly see more than once. #fatboyapproved"}
{"text":"Let me start with the positives: Location, interiors, ambience and service are all above average. These are what most Chinese restaurants in Richmond Hill / Markham lack and Lee Chen scored flying colours in these. 

Now, however, in terms of food - let me say that is a little underwhelming. The best one I tasted that night was the Dumpling soup (Siao Long Pau) and I would give that 8/10, the remainder of the dishes are just average - 6 at most including the Spareribs, Szechuan Shrimp, Almond Fish. Some of the dishes are so sweet that it's something that you could literally get from Mandarin. There's just nothing special to it and definitely not an authentic attempt at Chinese cuisine. It's probably a Chinese fusion dishes. If you're not familiar with Chinese dishes, this would be the place to go.

Also, they charge $2 for hot teas? What Chinese restaurant in Toronto would charge for hot tea? I don't mind paying $2 and we did in fact with no qualm but I'm sure there are people who got turned off a little he moment they learn they have to pay for hot tea."}
{"text":"Located at Yonge and Bloor, Lee Chen is an Asian fusion restaurant that's serving some traditional and creative dishes. 
They've got an extensive menu along with daily specials for both lunch and dinner.
The interior is clean and beautify with hints of pan Asian decor giving the ambiance a warm and cozy feeling. 
Their service is pleasant but at times a bit slow due to lunch time crowd. 
In terms of food digging into it I decided to try one of their lunch specials; Schezuan fish lunch.
lightly fried fish tossed in a Schezuan sweet and spicy sauce in an edible bowl, along with a bowl of salad and small bamboo dim sum cup of rice.
Presentation was beautiful with various selection of colors, after all I do eat with my eyes. The dish was pretty good, a solid 4.  Portions were sufficient and it was an overall good experience. 
Service was a 4, food selection 5, food 4, ambiance 5, price 4.

Overall Lee Chen is a solid 4."}
{"text":"Surprising Gem. When we walked by after reading some yelp reviews, we almost pass on it by looking at the exterior but we were starving and decided to try it anyways. 

Decor inside was exceptional from what we expected from the frontage since its was in the sub level. It was clean and service was excellent

Really nice soup dumpling and steam pork dumplings. The waitress recommended sweet-and-sour chicken which I thought it was not \"authentically Chinese\" but, it was the best one so chicken I've ever had.  Tender chunks of bread, lightly coated with fresh pineapples and the sauce was perfectly balance between sweet-and-sour. 

We also ordered General Tsao shrimp, Shanghai noodles and mushroom/peas sautéed. You can just tell when the ingredients are really fresh. Think you'll really enjoy taste and freshness. We would come back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous service.  Food was extremely fresh-especially the veggie dumplings. Very inviting and warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would really recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants soup dumpling, green onion pancake, fried dumplings or soup noodles in financial district. I love the fact that I don't have to go all the way to Chinatown to get good Chinese dishes. We ordered the soup dumplings and for once there was actually soup in it! It tasted so good! The fried pork dumplings were just as good, crispy on the outside and flavourful on the inside. We also ordered the pulled pork bao, that's the one I don't think is worth it. It was good but not great. The green onion pancake was ah-mazing! I think it might be the best I ever had. We also ordered the pork belly soup noodle and that was really good! The pork belly was my favourite! Overall I would give this restaurant 4/5. The restaurant can get busy really quick so the service might be a little slow. But other than that it was well worth it and the price is great! Definitely coming back when I am craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon. Restaurant was not that busy to my liking. The ambiance is very good.

Ordered the Xiao Long Bao after the good review on here, and Crystal Pork Belly.

Xiao Long Bao
To be honest, I'm slightly disappointed. It's not bad, but as a fan of xiao long bao and having had the real taste in Shanghai, these are mediocre at best. The skin was too thick and hard to my taste. There was soup, but not enough. The skin felt kind of old and tough, felt like not freshly steamed. There wasn't much umami; not \"xian\" enough as you'd put it in Chinese. 

Crystal Pork Belly
This dish was alright, fatty pork belly and the portion was big (8 pieces for $16). I feel like there is more than enough to share with 3 or 4 people, as 2 chunks will satisfy you. The flavor is mildy salty, and again lacks Umami. The meat texture was alright, not too tough but definitely does not melt in your mouth. I have had better pork belly that melt in your mouth (best one in my life), but generally speaking this is not bad. The two veggies on the side are a bit crispy and bland, which is perfect to go with the fatty, slightly salty meat. I enjoyed it.

Summary
Lack of umami. Very straight forward seasoning (mildy salty). Ambiance is great."}
{"text":"The interior is nice! the green onion pancake was nice and flaky, but too thick and pan fried a little too long. the soup dumplings were nice, but didn't amaze me. The crystal pork belly was absolutely fantastic. tasty tasty sauce, and rich succulent fat, and it came with bok choy! It was a heavy dish though, recommend sharing it and eating it with rice. Their service could have been better, it took us a while to flag them down, but they weren't rude."}
{"text":"Business lunch menu is quite nice. With meat. Vegetable. And spring roll. Price is decent. Clean interior.  Quick service.   Excellent jasmine tea"}
{"text":"This restaurant is such a lovely place with well-priced lunch options, a beautiful presentation, very quick service, and a clean and cozy dining experience. As upset as I am that this restaurant is closing down in Yorkville for yet another condo, I am excited to see it reopen on King/University! 

Also - delicious. I would love to see more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I came here a few years ago when they first opened and I wasn't impressed with how their food tasted and service was pretty bad too. However, I am very impressed with how far they've improved. Although they haven't improved on their service. Oh well.

Upon entering, you'd notice a very zen Chinese decor. It's a very relaxing dining environment. 

We ordered Xiao Long Bao, Green Onion Pancake, Crystal Pork Belly, and Guai Guai Chicken. 

I'd say their soup dumplings are one of the best I've had in DT Toronto. The skin was thin and silky. The filling was of a good portion where it didn't create a heavy chunks of pork and it made the soup oozed out nicely. 

The pancake, wasn't my favorite. I found it a little boring but my friends liked it. 

The crystal pork belly was really good. It was soft and tender and the flavor was spot on. I personally don't like fatty pork. The fatty layer was almost too much for me. I got more fat than meat. That's just me and I would order it again for sure. 

Lastly, the Guai Guai chicken. It looked simple but the flavour was dancing in my mouth. The sauce reminded me of \"Lou Sang\" a Chinese New Year dish. 

All and all, I would definitely go back and have some decent Chinese food. They do have more sophisticated and better tasting Chinese food, which you can hardly find in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum with my friend.  It was delicious.  The only thing we were disappointed with is that they didn't have Har Gow (steamed shrimp dumplings).  It's such a stable of dim sum!  Other than that, however, it was very tasty.  I tried the soup dumplings and I love how they just explode in your mouth with flavour."}
{"text":"Xiaolongbao tastes good! I think this restaurant has the best xiaolongbao in Toronto. 

Atmosphere is quite. Compare to other Chinese restaurants, this place is clean and stylish."}
{"text":"This location offers take in or dine out. If you take dine out make sure to check the order before leaving the location. My order was missing an item (a soup). 

3/5 *"}
{"text":"Excellent food and customer service, dumplings were amazing. Fried rice excellent too. A place to be with the whole family."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5
Environment: 4/5
Service: 5/5
Value: 4/5

As a shanghai native, I approve of this restaurant. The Wuxi spareribs are to die for. It is better than the ribs I've had in China!  Unlike most Chinese restaurants, Lee Chen offers a clean and comfortable dining environment. It is a lot pricier than most Chinese restaurants, but the quality of the food and service makes up for it. The servers don't hustle you for your order and check. Lee Chen offers authentic Chinese comfort food in the heart of Toronto."}
{"text":"Another Toronto eatery that had us smiling after. Service was great and food was really good. The decor was nice too. Would recommend this place for locals and visitors."}
{"text":"Food was alright, staff was very friendly. I guess the price is ok for Yorkville area but I still feel like there are better places with cheaper costs. The decoration inside is very nice although the seats in the booth we sat in are wooden and stiff so it was difficult to get comfortable. The overall atmosphere was nice.

We ordered hot & sour soup ($6ish) and was able to share it among two people. If you like spicy food, this was definitely spicy enough for me and I love spicy food. We got their signature fried rice ($13ish) and it was just typical yang chow fried rice with a fancy name on it. It was also a little oily for our preferences. With the rice we got their mapo tofu ($12ish) and I didn't think it was anything special. Finally tried their onion pancake ($6-7ish) which wasn't bad, a little salty for my tastes but my friend liked how layered and crisp the dough part was. Also I got a corona ($6-7) with a nice looking chilled cup to keep it nice and cold.

Probably won't go back because I have better places to try and nothing made me want to specifically come back but if I were in the area and not willing to blindly try something new, I would want to try their other food to give them another chance."}
{"text":"The best part about this restaurant is it's location! Don't get me wrong, the food is good too. Probably not the best authentic Chinese food that you can find in Toronto, but it's clean, offers good service, quality food at a fair price. I would absolutely visit this spot again."}
{"text":"Expensive and not worth to spend money on this not so delicious food. very little foods in the bowl. The food cost $3in china cost $20 here."}
{"text":"OMG LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Cannot describe how GOOD the food was at this place! We had one shumai, one XLB (soup dumplings), two orders (!) of beef soup noodle, and one pad Thai, one bubble tea, one soy milk, and one sesame balls in soup. All of them were D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S! Everything was authentic and affordable! Would highly recommend anyone who loves Chinese food or wants to try Chinese to visit this place. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"A stylish, modern, and decent place for a formal dinner. Good place for celebration. Nice service, quiet, relaxing, yet formal atmosphere, and very clean environment. However, the flaw is that the food was only ok."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant with great ambience, nicely done decor.  The rest rooms were clean and tidy - yes, I judge restaurants based on their rest rooms.  I went for a work dinner around 5pm, by about 6pm the place was getting filled up.  It is a bit pricier than your average Chinese restaurant, but the service and quality of the food make up for the price different.  The food was good, perhaps a bit smaller in serving for the price, but the taste excellent.  Would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Very good, huge portions. Dumplings are top!
We were served near to closing time, but still the staff was kind, informed and attended us in an expedited way."}
{"text":"Found bugs in my food and they didn't seem to care. Waited 15 min for the waiter to come and then took another 15 min for the manager to come. I told them I didn't want the food anymore but they still ended up charging me regular price. Never going back here again. Service is crap, food is terrible, and it's very expensive."}
{"text":"Soup dumplings are the highlight of this place but the rest falls pretty flat in comparison to the large selection of dim sum in Scarborough and Toronto. For the price you can get much much more at your local dim sum hole in the wall. I suppose this will do if you are really craving dim sum and don't have access to transportation to go somewhere better."}
{"text":"We can always count on Lee Chen when we come to Toronto. The food is excellent - freshly made and delicious. My favourite is the fried dumplings with shrimp , pick and chives. The Chinese Pancakes are also wonderful. My husband loved the Wonton soup tonight. I was too full to have it! Service is fast, pleasant and courteous and prices reasonable. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This has been our go to for ages since it's a block away from home.  If you want easy access Chinese food this is your place.  They say judge the bathrooms as an indication of what the kitchen is like, so everything is clean, and you'll get your food freshly prepared and hot.   We always order the same things, and I'm usually all about the starters.  The steam dumplings, salt and pepper chicken, tofu and scallion noodles are all good from the start.  Rice cake soup is really really good too.  Try it and tell me what you think."}
{"text":"As far as Americanized Asian food goes, Lee Chen isn't bad.

I was part of a large group at lunch, so I decided to just order from the \"Business Lunch\" menu. A quick perusal quickly brought me to the often-reliable General Tso Chicken (\"stir fried w/onion & red chilies in a tangy spicy sauce\").

A short time later, the food arrived. The presentation is certainly unique, as the restaurant serves the main dish in a bowl made out of a crispy wonton wrapper (ie the bowl is edible!) The dish also comes with a bowl of rice, a salad, and a spring roll (which was oddly served almost 10 minutes after I received the platter).

The food is okay. It comes with a whole mess of red chilies, which are too spicy to eat. But the problem is, the dish is otherwise totally lacking in spice. It's actually pretty bland, to be frank. The small portion only adds insult to injury, but when coupled with the other items on the plate, it's a good amount of food. (The tasteless salad was pretty disastrous, admittedly, but the spring roll was good.)

I guess for a quick lunch Lee Chen is fine, but I can't imagine ever returning when there are so many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Before going to a TSO concert I was looking for good restaurant that was reasonable cost wise and of very good quality. I noticed a new restaurant where a bakery once was and I decided to give it a try.

The restaurant was near full capacity but had a spot for one.  I was promptly seated and checked out the menu. I ordered an onion pancake and the house noodle pork soup. Many restaurants over-salt their food or add msg, but not here. The food was flavorful, tasty and the service was grade A. No doubt, a definite must when in the King and University area."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent restaurant.  Good for food and atmosphere.  Not bad for business meeting or dates.  The food we ordered was good.  See pictures I uploaded for the good ones.  I left out the ones which were ugly.  Definitely not a food mine and worth the time.   It was otherwise a tad expensive."}
{"text":"The food is just ok. I tried a variety of dishes and found them to be quite one dimensional in flavour and many times more on the oily side. What I appreciated was that the noodles had a good texture to them, quite different from any other Chinese place I've had (more like a ramen or hand-pulled noodle type of elasticity/firmness to them). In particular, the peanut sesame noodles were quite good, but everything else was pretty standard.

If I could, I'd give this place a 7/10, but I've decided to round up because of the great service there. It isn't particularly fancy or over-the-top, but the servers are all quite pleasant and courteous, especially for Chinese restaurant standards. We had someone celebrating their birthday in our group, and they happily accommodated our cake and even presented a complimentary dessert. They were also good with splitting the bill for us.

The decor and vibe of the place are excellent as well. I always appreciate a place with an open kitchen. The food isn't quite to my liking but that's perhaps because it is a different style of Chinese cuisine from what I'm accustomed to. Overall, I'd still say the place is worth checking out if you've never tried it before."}
{"text":"I don't come here often enough. The price is reasonable, the service is quick, the food is good!

I've started to develop a liking to warm soy bean drink and Chinese donut/cruller. This place offers that! One order of each can be shared. Last time we were here, we also got some dumplings, scallion noodles, almond fish and the chow mein. That is quite a lot of food! The almond fish is amazing!! It went so well with the chow mein.

It's not the place I think of when I want Chinese food.  But in this neck of the woods, it is one of my favorite options for Chinese."}
{"text":"The restaurant is right across from the Toronto Reference Library. I passed by many times but never went in. I went in on a Friday during lunch time and it was packed. Menu looks standard all your Chinese noodle house items. We had two orders of the Xiao long bao, the stir fried dumplings, the spicy beef tendons, the Shanghai rice cakes, and the soy bean soup. All of them were pretty good and make for a satisfying meal. Nothing off the charts or anything with the WOW factor but given the value, the taste and the location, it was decent."}
{"text":"Excellent! We went here for first time since we were in town and the soup dumplings were amazing! If we come back to Toronto this will be a must stop! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Average at best...

What I ordered:

1. Soup filled dumplings

Not very juicy... not going to lie, they kind of taste the same as the frozen ones you buy from any Chinese supermarket. 

2. House fried rice cakes (pork)

The texture wasn't great and not very flavourful, just not the best fried rice cakes I've had. The toppings were kind of lacking and it's just not as good as Asian Legend! $15 was a bit more than I expected to pay for this dish. 

3. Spicy beef noodle soup

The noodles were good, the best part. The soup was meh.. the colour and smell just wasn't super appealing and felt very artificial. 

The restaurant itself is pretty cute and when I went on a Thursday night at 8:30, there were only a few other tables so it was good for talking. The staff are friendly, which is always nice."}
{"text":"i went to this place yesterday with a friend. it had a very nice decor and good service. waiters were friendly and dishes were taken away quickly. it's not expensive either. but the food was ok. i expected better. i got soup-filled dumplings and pad thai - the dumplings were good but not the best. there wasn't much soup inside dumplings, so that was a bit disappointing. pad thai wasn't that good. the usual non-authentic pad thai you can get in toronto is sour-ish but the one at lee chen was blend and kind of tasteless... well, this place specializes in chinese food so i guess it makes sense that their pad thai isn't great. i think i would come back if i were in the area and wanted some asian food in a nice place with good service, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to here."}
{"text":"*more of a 3.5 stars*

Lee Chen is deceptively small from the outside and surprisingly gigantic on the inside. We arrived a little before dinner time so we could sit anywhere, but at around 6 pm the entire restaurant was packed. The interior is really chic and I love how clean everything is- as well, the washroom is super nice! 

We ordered a few appetizers and a main course. The waitress was attentive- she made sure our water glasses were always full and she cleared our plates immediately. The food arrived within minutes and the serving size was good enough to split between the two of us. The food itself tasted alright- nothing special, but decent enough to keep us full.

It's Shanghai cuisine, and I haven't seen a lot of places that sell Chinese cruller donuts or soup dumplings in Toronto, so it's worth visiting Lee Chen to eat them. They're not the Best I've Ever Had! but they're good for a quick bite. 

Tip: order more appetizers (soup dumplings etc)  and less main courses (rice cakes, noodles etc)"}
{"text":"The spicy beef noodle is mediocre at best and it's way too expensive. It cost $15.50 for a bowl!!! They put so less noodles and so much soup. This is just another example of Charidise that just opened not long ago.A nice looking place but so overpriced."}
{"text":"Very impressive dining experience!  Honestly, our whole party was quite impressed and we would happily come back for more. 

One of the diners was staying in the neighbourhood and when asked about dinner preferences, she said Asian!  Nothing more than that. Just Asian. Since she is a world traveller, has cultured taste, and is Asian, we had to find someplace great and quickly. 

So first of all, thank you, fellow Yelpers!  

After my wife narrowed down to a few options, we turned to all of our Yelping friends to make the decision. The reviews seemed honest and pretty good and hence we took a chance on this 4 star rated restaurant. And we are really glad we did. 

We made a quick reservation for a few hours later and they took it happily. Mind you the place was not that busy.   When we walked in they offered us window or dining room and we chose one of the two booths in the window. The menus came and since we hadn't seen each other in a while we talked and caught up without making choices. The wait team were very polite and did not rush us. We asked for Jasmine tea and it was good. We then proceeded to pick some of the delicacies. 

Our order consisted of soup dumplings (so good we ordered a second after the first). Thin dough layer and brimming with deliciousness. We have had Din Tai Fong in HK and while they are the kings/queens of this fare, the ones at Lee Chen were excellent. A savoury soy soup, my wife remembered this from when she was little. And liked it very much. 
Next came the pork dumplings the green onion cake and the mushrooms and snow pea leaves. 

And surprise surprise, all of them were really good. The snow pea leaves were cooked to perfection. Colour and all. Just enough crunch and so full of flavour. 

Then we got fancy. The House fried rice cakes were so good, texture and all that I think I ate the whole plate. Like little discs of pure pleasure and the flavouring was light but also complex. Add a beef noodle soup, which was deemed ok, and some rice with Ma Po Tofu and we had some eating before us. 

Apparently Ma Po Tofu is complicated to make and is a telltale sign of a good chef. While the peppercorn spice is not my cup of tea, I did enjoy this dish as well. 

For dessert we ordered the peanut coated Tang Yuan, which are made in house, and were the perfect topper to cap off our feast. 

Even though the food was Asiazing (yup, my new word of the day) it was the service that pushed this place to 5 stars for me.   For example, we wanted Sapporo for three people and asked for two pints spread across three glasses. No trouble at all. We were there until close and again no trouble. The team recommended items, answered questions and I felt genuinely cared for. 

As for ambiance, it is casual to fancy.  And overall a very clean and pleasant place to eat. 

Price is a little higher than you would expect for Similar fare but I think that may be a little to do with the quality and location. 

If you are in the neighbourhood, venture in and you will be rewarded!"}
{"text":"Really good food and decor. Priced were reasonable as well.

Ordered dumplings which were flavorful, wonton soup, and a rice dish. All tasted great but portions were on the smaller side. Only miss was the pork belly buns, which you created yourself fajita style and curiously had spicy mayo that IMO didn't go with the bun at all. Thanks for trying though, and you can just eat without.

Another major gripe that I wish the restaurant would fix is the cups. They are notoriously hard to hold with such a tiny handle."}
{"text":"I have been to the Yonge and Bloor location many times, but have decided to try this location which is close to work. Restaurant is very spacious and it is one of the better Chinese restaurants downtown that's not really expensive. They have lunch specials that range from $10 to $15 that comes with rice, a spring roll and a salad. My recommendation is the spicy beef noodles from their regular menu - it's actually not that spicy, just has a bit of a kick - and the beef briskets are quite tender.

Was going to knock a star off as we had to ask our server several times to bring us cutlery for sharing the food, but the free dessert at the end made up for it."}
{"text":"I came for the soup dumplings and they were alright. Service is fast though. The dan dan noodles were my favourite."}
{"text":"I was just in the mood for some chicken fried rice after work (I work across the street from Lee Chen) so stopped by to try them out.  I need all these \"chinese diners\" to recognize something - I don't care how pretty your restaurant is, you simply cannot, EVER charge $11.29 for a small single serving of fried rice.  You can't.  You CAN'T!  YOU CAN'T!!!!!!!!!  For $11.29 that rice dish better feed the whole table with leftovers!  

I can get a massive single serving of amazing fried rice at Sam Kee at Jones and Gerrard for $4.  I can get a massive table sized seving of fried rice at Swatow at Spadina and Dundas for $7.  If you are thinking of charging $9.99+ tax for a single serving of fried rice, get over yourself, your restaurant really isn't THAT good.

I'll give this place two stars since the rice itself wasn't horrible but it was very typical chicken fried rice, a touch too greasy and definitely loaded with too much MSG.

I got my food to go.  I might have eaten there if wasn't eerily empty and the two servers weren't bickering.  They eventually bickered over who should bag my meal for me as well.  Nice.

Their other food might be fine but the serving size matched with the price tells me this is just another overpriced mediocre joint on Yonge Street."}
{"text":"This was a last minute decision and I am so glad we chose to try this place.  The food and service were fantastic! And two people (including a bottle of plum wine) and samples of at least 8 dishes? Was just around $100.  No one in their right mind needs as much food as we ordered. We couldnt finish it all but when you see the menu you will understand why we wanted to try everything!

We had their special dumplings with soup cooked inside - sinfully delicious
Rice cakes - new to me - extremely flavorful and generous portions!
Pulled pork dumplings - softest dumpling I have ever tasted, pork tender and well spiced
Green onion pancake - im not an expert here but my companion claims they taste very authentic
Did I mention the plum wine? Well worth adding to the feast.
Then for mains we had the pork ribs (fell off the bone), a tofu dish with vegetables in broth and a traditional noodle dish I am told is served on food carts back home.
The sesame coconut balls for dessert are a must try! We also had the more traditional balls in soup dessert...like I said we tried a lot of different food options - most of which were new to us.

The servers were extremely helpful explaining what we were eating - and although the restaurant was packed - we felt like the only patrons there. Super attentive (but not in a creepy way).

We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I was drawn by the # of Elite yelp reviews and high rating. So I decided to try it ourselves.  I can only give this place 2 stars due to the prices and overall food experience.  We ordered the spicy beef tendon appetizer to start. The taste was good but very small portion. The Sia long bao was next. Which again I say was underwhelming given they charged Ding Tai Fong prices for maybe T&T taste.  The beef noodle soup we ordered was okay in taste but @ 15.95, I could of ordered 2 bowls in Chinatown or a superior bowl maybe @ Magic Noodles for better.   It also could be that I'm Chinese and maybe this place really caters to the non hardcore authentic experience."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a dumpling restaurant downtown Toronto for a while and after trying out this place... I'm still looking. Dumplings were not as expected- too much dough around and the filling was not as good as elsewhere. I would rate their dumplings 2 stars only. However I really liked the greens here and the atmosphere is really nice, as well. I would come back to try their curries and different greens but not the dumplings. I still think that Ding Tai Fung dumplings are the best I have tried so far."}
{"text":"I come here often with my coworker, I think as much as once a week (as embarrassing as that may be...) But we absolutely love this place! It's usually pretty busy during the weekday during lunch hours. 

The staff here are friendly and are always smiling. Tables and surroundings are really clean. Wait for food isn't really that long.

When my friend and I come here we always get the usual. She gets the Shanghai noodle soup and I get the Hot and Sour Noodle soup. The soup is absolutely delicious. The noodles are the thick shanghai noodles, they are cooked perfectly, not too soft not too firm. The broth however, when I'm almost done the soup, leaves my nose running like a faucet. I have a high tolerance to spicy food, but every time I finish my soup. It leaves my nose running. 

For anyone coming here for lunch, I recommend you order from the back of the menu (the lunch specials). You it usually comes with one vegetable spring roll, an order of meat (chicken, beef or pork, depending on the dish you chose) and an decent side of rice or noodles. The rice comes in the most adorable tiny dim sum steamer!"}
{"text":"Xiao Long Bao's are out of this world (although a bit on the small side, so def need more than 1 order). Great ambiance, clean, and service is good. A bit on the pricier side."}
{"text":"I find myself oddly disappointed consistently when I go to Lee Chen or order from there. 

I have it built in my mind that the food is going to be great and that I'll really enjoy it there. However, it never seems to be the case and that the food is mediocre at best. It isn't worth the money in my opinion. The servings for take out aren't great either and I felt ripped off a bit.

It's OK in a pinch but not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Step into this restaurant on a busy weekday for lunch and you are instantly transformed.   It's on the lower level along King Street and away from the noise. We did not have a reservation. There is a small sign along the street in case you get lost as this restaurant is abit hidden. 

I have never had my order brought to me so quickly. I had lunch with a co-worker around 13:00pm on a Thursday afternoon. It took about 5-7 minutes before flavourful steaming food came out. I ordered the Kung Pao. Presentation was definitely fusion based hence the theme of  this restaurant. On a white square plate were a large single spring roll, steamed white rice, a small salad and a bowl of sweet and sour spiced chicken. 

The rice was served in a cute little brown bamboo weaved basket that also had a cover. I noticed that the salad had about three pieces of boiled eggs on top. I did not appreciate that. It's either you put an entire egg or you don't. It seemed odd as it was just three tiny pieces. The salad was iceberg lettuce tossed in a delicious sauce. The flavours I cannot decipher but it reminded me of a Thai peanut sauce despite the white colour. I enjoyed the spring roll. It was steaming hot. Golden and crispy it was stuffed with vegetables such as carrots. I paired this with the packets of plump sauce that was available on the table. The spicy chicken was presented in a rice paper bowl that was edible. It was about 1 1/2 cup of vegetables and chicken in the bowl. The steams made me want to dive in without regard for the hot temperature of the dish. The bowl was crispy on the top. I could not resist breaking a piece off to taste it. The chicken was tender but not spicy at all. It was accompanied with red and green bell peppers that were cut to the same size and white onions. I found a large piece of onion with a piece of the head attached. The vegetables and chicken were steeping in flavourful juices and topped with roasted cashews. They were unsalted. In the end, the bowl sucks up the juices and makes eating the bowl delicious. The star of this dish were the four dried red chillies. I obviously ate all four. Again not spicy at all. 

Chopsticks were too large. However, they provide a fork in case you can't use them well (quite handy on their part if you ask me). Dressings on the table were the standard soy sauce and chilli oil. I tried the chilli oil on its own and it was not the least bit spicy. I like spicy so I may be bias here. The bill came with fortune cookies of course. 

They have a lunch special menu which I recommend ordering from as food is alittle on the pricey end here. The lunch special is at the back of the menu. There was a nice calming atmosphere with music playing in the background. I liked that it was the right amount of lighting to give a nice business feel to the place. I liked that the air conditioning temperature was set perfectly as it was a hot day. We were seated immediately upon walking in which is always a bonus. You can always tell alit about a place from the state of the washroom. It was a beautiful washroom that was clean and modern. It goes without saying that the restaurant on a whole was clean, spacious and breathable. I think this is hardly the design for restaurants downtown. This pale cuts it. 

Overall, this is definitely a place worth trying. Service was good. I would visit again."}
{"text":"Food tastes really good, however somewhat on the pricey side. Also I find the seating pretty crammed."}
{"text":"The pork bao buns were amazing, but the steamed soup dumplings were just ok. The skins were tough and there wasn't enough soup. The plum wine was good, but overly strong almost like bourbon."}
{"text":"If you are in the Yorville area and happen to be craving for Chinese food, Lee Chen is probably your best bet.  The food is here is adequate, the wait staff here is more professional than those in Chinatown, the decor is nice, and the ambience is relaxing.

I stopped by here for lunch and I ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and soup dumplings.  The noodles were were good; they were the Taiwanese style that came with pickled vegetable you can put into your soup (which cuts the strong soy sauce flavour of the broth).  The noodles were nice and chewy and the chunks of beef loin and brisket were very tender.  I was disappointed by my soup dumplings because there was barely any \"soup\" in them.  I didn't get that surge of hot soup when I bit into one; I could actually just put the whole thing in my mouth and eat it like I would a normal dumpling.  Needless to say, it's a letdown when you're expecting something to be hearty and juicy but it falls flat (literally).  

I would come back again if I were too lazy to go to Asian Legend in Chinatown but I definitely won't be ordering the soup dumplings again."}
{"text":"Wanted to try some dim sum so decided to try this place out. The restaurant is located below ground level in a business building. There was no wait when we got here but the restaurant seems busy with 5-6 table left.

The waitress here are very nice and attentive to our needs. The food was good. But I still like dim sum from LA better. We order Xiu Mai, pork dumplings, wonton soup, and pork buns. 

The xiu mai and pork dumplings tasted very generic just like every other places I've tried. Their wonton soup was just okay. A little bit flavorless, however the pork buns was extraordinary ... they gave us a dish filled with veggies, sauce and pork and a separate plate of buns. You wrap the buns in the spot. Overall good quality was better than average but it wasn't exceptional."}
{"text":"Canada never let me know on Chinese food. 

A friend lives in Toronto recommended this Shanghainese food place to us. It looks tiny from the outside but actually pretty big inside.

The soup filled dumpling is more of a \"OK\" dish. It could be more flavorful than what we had. King mushroom sautéed pea shoots is super good. The mushroom is very fresh and tasty and works perfect with the pea shoots. Wuxi Spareribs is super good! It's one of these dished you'd remember for a while after eating. The ribs were perfect cooked, tender but flavorful. Crystal pork belly is impressive too, if you don't mind eat something a bit greasy. The sauce and everything in the dish is just perfect. 

I'm surprised people just gave a 3.5 star to this restaurant. I'm totally happy with my experience here."}
{"text":"I was in town for a convention, and my coworkers and I were looking for a fun place to eat on a Wed evening. Walked by this place and my coworker (who is Asian) said because there were Asians eating there, it had to be good, so in we walked. It wasn't very crowded, and the atmosphere was relaxed. Really liked the décor, too. My Asian coworker proceeded to order dim sum for us (in Chinese, so we had no idea what we were getting). Needless to say, everything was great - even the eggplant (and I don't like eggplant but loved their version). The service was attentive - there was an older gentlemen who was a total character, joking around with us. Was a wonderful meal and would definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

When I first heard the name of the restaurant, I thought it was a spin off of Lee or a collaboration of some sort hahaha.. but I was wrong :p

Lee Chen has a classy yet traditional interior with wooden furniture and decors. It brings me right back to Shanghai (I just came back from Asia!) and I am curious to try our Canadian version.

Service was great :) Very courteous and attentive. Waiter automatically speaks to me in mandarin, but I appreciate that they can switch back to English unlike in Shanghai (my mandarin barely passed in Asia hahaha...)

Food was good. Xiao Long Bao (soup dumpling) definitely can't compare to the ones in Shanghai but it was decent but a bit smaller in size.

Almond fish was thin, did not have much fish meat but it was pan fried and completely coated with sliced almonds. If you love almonds, you'd love this dish!

Shanghai soup noodles was really good :) The texture of the noodles was chewy which I love very much... kinda reminds or of hor fun (thin rice noodles).

Shanghai garlic bok choy was delicious. Simple dish but I enjoyed it very much. Plus, I haven't been eating much veggies during my meat-eating Asia trip lol... so this was really nice!

Tang yuan in sweet wine soup had my favourite black sesame tang yuan (glutinous balls)! Normally in this particular dish, the tang yuan is served without a filling and is much smaller. This dish has fermented rice in it too... so you can get full from it lol. I think I would enjoy the tang yuan in clear soup than in their version of wine soup.

Overall, very pleasant meal :) Be sure to get your fortune cookie on your way out! (We took one on the way in too hahaha!) My fortune said I am a very wise person lol. #justfotlaughs

P.S. This is the 100th review for Lee Chen, weeeeee :D"}
{"text":"My friend and I were both hungry and we were around this area so...we decided to try this restaurant. 

The restaurant has nice decoration and the service is pretty good. The staffs are friendly and nice. They let my friend charge her phone in the back (where the kitchen is; and not all chinese restaurant will let you do that). 

The food portions were decent. We ordered pork belly over rice, noodle soup (beef, baby boxchoy), and shaomai. The rice was pretty good, even it's listed under appetizer,  my friend and I got half-fulled finishing it. The soup was yummy. It was big, I couldn't finish  it myself. It came in a big bowl, the meat was very tender. The broth was good yet a bit plain. But few drops of soy sauce makes it better. The shao mai was okay, too salty for me. 

The price was reasonable for a nice, upscale Chinese restaurant with good customer service and for high quality, authentic Chinese food.

I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This is a really good Asian place. We went for the soup dumplings and they are good. Love the hot sauce. The almond fish is a unique appetizer."}
{"text":"A little bit pricey, but the quality of their food is really good. I usually come here for lunch with my parents since it is a nicer setting and the food is higher quality. It does have a bit more of a western feel to it since they have fortune cookies everywhere and you have to pay for tea. 

I probably wouldn't come here myself, but if you have some nicer company and want a better looking Chinese restaurant with better service id choose here."}
{"text":"TASTY FOOD! COMFORT AMBIANCE! GOOD LOCATION! 
quite delicious shanghai dim sum here! their soup dumplings are classic and local?xiao long boa! I am excited to find soup dumplings are not been \"westernized\"!
Next time I'll try the CHINESE CRULLERS
(Youtiao) & soy bean milk!
BTW their Original green bubble tea are the best I have ever tried in Toronto!"}
{"text":"At first, I was very impressed by its interior. This place made me think that I was in China. My husband and I ordered xiaolongbao, popcorn chicken, Taiwanese rice dish and spicy beef noodle. I was very excited, but soon I was very disappointed. This restaurant took so long to have soy milk ready(not the fresh kind), but it was okay. Got soup dumplings after waiting for 20 minutes. After a while, got our rice dish. Suddenly there was nobody working in the kitchen...it was not even 7 pm.... finished rice dish, and waited more. Chefs came  back  after 15min or so, and we started seeing other tables receiving soup dumplings faster than we received. They even got my noodle dish...!!!! I ordered my dish before other people even showed up!We called waitresses(yes called more than one). After waiting another long minutes, our waitress came, and we asked about our order. There was no answer or explanation. We finally decided to leave. All we needed was simple explanation and apologies! Bad service! Food was okay, not like coming back quality."}
{"text":"Ate here during lunchtime last week and my friend and I absolutely loved it. Great flavours, fresh and authentic feel. We ordered the green thai curry (excellent) beef and broccoli which was also very good and the pad thai, delish! I also loved the presentation and great service. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I did not expect to like this place as much as I did. Everything was absolutely delicious!  

My friend and I had the Vegetable Dumplings to start and thoroughly enjoyed them! They are steamed to perfection and super flavourful!  These are very filling, so definitely good for sharing!  

For our main course we had the Black Bean Chicken and an order of Egg Fried Rice. I have never had Chinese food like it before. It wasn't greasy at all and the chicken was cooked PERFECTLY! It looked like a lot of food at first, but the two of us managed to pretty much polish it off. 

I really had no intentions of ordering dessert, until I saw the Coconut Sesame Pillows on the dessert menu.  Who the heck can turn down a pastry referred to as a \"pillow\"?? It sounded too heavenly to pass up and I am so glad that we didn't.  You have GOT to try these - they're addictive.  

The service was also fantastic. The waitstaff are very friendly here and they really strive to provide a relaxing dining atmosphere.  Our waiter made excellent recommendations and was very attentive.  They even put a little cooler pack around our white wine carafe - nice touch!"}
{"text":"2.5/5

Im from Markham which means my dim sum standards are high. Though Lee Chen did have some good dishes, I just did not enjoy my favourite go-to's as much as I usually do. 

My first fave is Xiao long bao (soup dumpling). They really aren't that tasty here. The dumplig is very doughy and the inside is nearly void of soup. Its as if its just the natural juices from the meat filling. Kind of defeats the purpose.

Another fave of mine is Siu mai. This was also done terribly. The dough was once again thick and even worse, it was dry too. It just threw me off guard because I am used to a softer texture. 

House noodle soup (pork) was a terrible disappointment as well. Noodles were disgusting store-bought tasting udon noodles. I feel that they are the \"don-don\" noodles you buy from no frills. Barely any pork. The broth alone was not impressive.

The two dishes that were good were Szechuan shrimp (very good, actually) and the green onion pancakes. I loved the shrimp because they were slightly spicy and there were ao many! It is an expensive dish but, in this case, you get what you pay for. Not much to say about the pancakes. They were good. 

Dinner came to $55...and we drank water fyi...But the servers are nice and ambience is pretty. If any of these two were missing, it would easily be 1 star."}
{"text":"The food is slightly better than the Chinese food you find in a mall. 

The bigger problem is that the restaurant doesn't put any vegetables in their food.   And even when you find some, it's thinly shredded pieces of the cheapest vegetables like onions and carrots.

If you're just looking for some noodles or rice with some veggies, look elsewhere.  It's all onion.  They're too cheap to put any actual vegetables in their food."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good quality Chinese food in the Entertainment District then try this place. The food was great. The soup dumplings are a great app. The staff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Yes!, giving this this place 5 stars. The food has the WOW factor here, and even simple dishes such as chicken with broccoli have a different spin here. The shrimp curry actually had more shrimp than filler, the service here is excellent and the decor is clean and modern :) Great location too :) If you are in the mood for Western Style Chinese food but with a flavor infusion you really need to try this place out :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice. I love the decor. I have to say the food was exceptional but the service wasn't as great. My boyfriend and I got a bunch of appetizers. Dumplings, shrimp dumplings. We also got the rice roll with pork and the specialty soup dumplings that is VERY VERY good. I would recommend this place to anyone. I just hope the service is better next time!"}
{"text":"With a full house at Gyu-Kaku and an estimated wait time of over 45 minutes, we opted for some good old classic Chinese cuisine. 

The foods we ate did not disappoint! We ordered the House Fried Rice Cakes, the Spare Ribs, Xiao long Bao, Cold Noodles, and Shao Mai. 

They all were really delicious but the cold noodles really stood out for me. I loved their creamy peanut sauce. It was also slightly sweet. It was great!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but they do not take Amex card. If you pay US dollar in cash, the rate is 1:1, I checked today's exchange rate is 1 $ to 1:28 Canada $, I also gave tips. What a rip off!"}
{"text":"I don't quite understand why their rating are so low given the fact that their food is really authentic. I got the soup dumpling and beef noodle soup. Both were fantastic and tasted exactly like the one I used to have in China. Strongly recommend to those who want authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and the food is quite salty. However, I still really like the Szechuan fish ($14.95). The fish is very tender and garlic-y. This combo comes with rice, Edamame and a spring roll. Their Pan Fried Shrimp, Pork & Garlic Chives Dumplings ($7.50 for 6) are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Staff remains very nice but not as attentive as at the begining of this place. Whereas they once decided to be open until 11pm during week-ends, now they are back to 10pm only, every day.
More importantly and very sadly, whereas the freshness remains, the quality of the food has degradated... dumplings were amazing and now they are too oily and blander. I almost thought that Asian legends was better (this latter is good but not as good as this place was before, but at least they proved to be consistent). 

Please react, do something, I want to go back and be as flabbergasted as I was the first 2 times I came here. Work on the quality. I don't care about fancy printed menus with pictures. I care about food."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to avoid the crowds you always find at Ding Tai Fung. Mission accomplished!

The interior of Lee Chen is very nice, and you'll find it located down a set of stairs from street level. The staff was nice and attentive in getting us seated, taking our orders, and checking in on us.

We ordered a variety of foods, but we came here for xialongbao (XLB) and it did not disappoint. It had all the characteristics of top notch soup dumplings that you'll find at any decent Chinese place in a Toronto. Thin skin, soupy broth, well seasoned meat, and it doesn't tear at the slightest pull.

The other items we had like the Guai Guai chicken were very different from standard Chinese cuisine, but it was a nice cross between something Chinese and Hispanic because of the salsa like sauce.

The veggies (king mushroom sautéed with pea shoots) were great and goes so well with rice, which you actually have to ask for separately.

This was a great find and I'll gladly come back again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I would of never found this place, it's basically a secret spot if your told exactly where to go. It's just taking notice that it's downstairs or underground or a lower level when your on the street.

Blessed vibe, amazing food! Clean washrooms, service was on point. Everything was great about this place.

Went during the international car show so plenty of restaurants were crazy busy. But my girlfriend stumbled upon this restaurant and we actually walked by it because another restaurant was too busy so walked back and found it. 

We ordered a ton of food, green onion pancake, pork dumplings, fried tofu, fried rice, Thai green curry chicken pad Thai and pork noodles and everything was on POINT!! Everything was amazing I couldn't believe how everything was so good. Maybe I was just hungry but damn definitely coming back to try everything else."}
{"text":"Tried this place open on a holiday, and it was not bad. Service was decent but there was a language barrier when we went. Hopefully that has improved since opening. Prices are okay. Food is good. The restaurant is worth a try.

We tried:

Xiao Long Bao: they weren't piping hot just warm so kinda disappointing at the time but it was soft and filled with juice so it was good.

Green onion pancake: not bad but needs a bit more flavour. 

Siu mai: really enjoyed these with the shrimp on top.

Pulled pork bao: quite small baos and just decent flavour.

Cow mein: was not bad but again needed some extra flavour to make it great

Braised pork belly over rice: again needed something to put it into great territory."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Service was barely existent. Food was very bland and fatty. And overpriced for the quality of the food. Would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by my second visit, like another reviewer. Food quality has definitely gone downhill but the service quality is what has deteriorated the most. Got one of the main course dishes WAAYY later than other dishes, and each time we needed a server we had to spend a long, long time trying to get their attention. Had to finally walk up to the server. Hope they buck up!"}
{"text":"A very interesting Chinese bistro restaurant. delicious goid and fast friendly service. king street west downtown near theatres and st Andrew station."}
{"text":"We had the Kung Pao beef, garlic chicken with broccoli and Wuxi pork ribs.  My beef dish was nothing to write home about.  In fact, I found the beef to have an odd texture to it.  The garlic chicken was very garlicky but okay.  The pork ribs were supposed to be marinated with a ginger soy sauce, but it tasted like hoisin to me.  But it was still pretty good.  Overall, this place was decent and the service was very prompt and attentive."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Lee Chen for lunch today and it was not the most satisfactory experience I've had at an Asian restaurant. Customer service was fair - not bad, also not stellar. In hindsight, we should have taken the almost empty restaurant as a sign, as well as the fact that it was called an \"Asian Bistro\" cause we all know that usually never works. The dumplings were average (not sure if they were handmade or not). But my main course, the wonton noodle soup, was terribly bland. The wontons in it were yummy, but the broth was pretty much unseasoned. Definitely turned me off. We also got two different kinds of wok noodle dishes to share, one of them being the shrimp chow mein which I also didn't enjoy. The rest of my family got their Business Lunch plates, and although some of it were good, the fried spring roll that came with the plates were grainy and most likely frozen. Price-wise, I think it was a few dollars more expensive than a standard (read: better!) Chinese restaurant that you'd find in San Francisco.
TL;DR: If you've had excellent and authentic Chinese food before, leave your expectations out the door cause this place isn't going to live up to them. Sorry!"}
{"text":"I love their lunch specials and of course, my favourites, the spicy beef noodle soup and soup dumplings. For a Chinese restaurant downtown, it's actually a pretty good place, and the food quality is pretty close with the Asian places up in Markham/Richmond Hill. 

The decor and atmosphere gives you a pretty modern Asian feel to it. Service and cleanliness of the restaurant is also pretty decent.

Although the cooking style and taste is not the full on traditional type, where you'd expect a much stronger taste in spices, I'd still recommend it for Chinese food lovers around the area."}
{"text":"Food was overall very good. Green Onion Pancake and a Fried Dumplings were excellent. General Tso was good but nothing special. Service was horrible. Had to ask several times for water refills and even had to ask for the bill."}
{"text":"Solid Taiwanese food in downtown Toronto and you won't find another Chinese restaurant in the city that is clean, has efficient service and good food. We ordered the crystal pork belly, soup dumplings, fried dumplings, fried rice, hot and sour noodle soup and beef noodle soup. The soup dumplings could have been better (I like Asian Legend's more) but everything else was delicious. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I would say the best xiao long bao in downtown I always hog 1 order to myself minimum. .The service here is always attentive and friendly. Their lunch combo menus are also decently priced."}
{"text":"This fusion restaurant was really easy to get to from my friend's apartment downtown. We came after a night out during pride for some dim sum, and a little bit of a wake me up. 

We split a bottle of the of the sake between four of us, and the server would fill a little carafe with the sake, bring it to be heated and then bring it back to our table for us to consume! They were very quick (though it might've been because it wasn't super busy when we were there). 

All the food we ordered was pretty tasty, although next time I probably wouldn't order a rice based dish. The pork belly was delicious and wish that we had ordered another plate. Should hopefully be back here in about a months time!"}

I never expect Lee Chen Asian Diner to be that good!

I was a little skeptic when I saw the menu. I thought Lee Chen is a restaurant that specializes in Northern Chinse cuisine, but Pad Thai? Teriyaki? Curry?

The decor is really chic and has a lot of Chinese styled furnitures. 

I was greeted warmy by the staffs and sitted at the booth.

I want to drink some hot tea which is usually complimentary in \"Chinese\" restaurants and usually served automatically but here teas are $1.99. 

Jasmine Tea ($1.99) 
- it was  served as a tea bag I got from T&T in a saucer cup... I wish it is loose leaf tea, no such luck!

Spicy Beef Noodle Soup ($8.99)
- the braised beef was so tender and flavoured. especially the tendons has this rich butter texture
- the noodles was chewy and soft at the same time, with a great bite 
- apparently, the noodle though not made in house, but was made to order with a special recipe from the noodle factory
- The broth was quite good, but not spicy at all... chilli sauce on the table fixed that problem!

I was almost ready to leave then suddenly I have a craving for something sweet. The dessert choice here was diisappointing lacking! The waiter suggested:

Black Sesame filled Balls in Sweet Wine Soup ($5.49)
- a little over cooked as the filling was leaking when I tried eating them
- the sweet wine though smell good, but just too carb heavy for my taste

Free WIFI just ask for the password!

Waitstaffs needs a lot of training! Hopefully the next time I drop by to try out some dumplings, everything would be running smoothly!"}
{"text":"Compared to my favorite restaurants in Chinatown, this place is more expensive but also less crowded and less noisy. Food is good and the menu offering plenty of choice."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Somewhat tight inside for strollers. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for an afternoon snack.   The service was great and the food was good, but nothing special.  The restaurant does northern Chinese dishes like Xiao long bao and green onion pancakes.  This is not a Cantonese dim sum restaurant. If you want dim sum in the downtown. Area, you would be better off going to Lai Wah Heen."}
{"text":"The good was insanely good. The vibe was casual and friendly.  I will return as frequently as possible and will dream about the house rice cakes."}
{"text":"Très savoureux avec de très bonnes portions. Le personnel y est accueillant. L'ambiance chaleureuse avec beaucoup d'espace pour souper en amoureux"}
{"text":"Very good reviews so I checked it out. Not happy with service. I could tell the waitress was being pushed around by the manager too hard. Waitress was the only one to speak to me the entire time despite having 10+ workers brushing my back while doing other things. 

Food was decent. Not great portions for $16 per person. Seems like they got comfy or just assumed that someone coming in alone was a write-off. Not worth the high price tag!"}
{"text":"Everything here is pretty good and tasty but the bigger noodle dishes are a little on the pricier side. I guess the ambience makes up for it though - nice decor, clean. Love the beef noodles and xialongbao here. Fiery wontons are pretty good too (tip: dip it in the vinegar that comes with the xialongbao if you order that too - so good!!). Pretty authentic! Wish they had half portions of the veggies though... can never order when there's just two of you because theyre big and kinda pricy. Would be good for large parties though! Also don't know why they don't offer the fortune cookies with the bill... I always grab one on the way out anyway."}
{"text":"I would recommend eating at Lee Chen. Their food is amazing and they have excellent soup dumplings. Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"Awesome new place that just opened up recently. My favourite dishes were their Xiao Long Bao, Pork Belly Bao and Beef Noodle Soup . Has a nice authentic Shanghai style taste to it, will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I noticed that Lee Chen opened up near my office but didn't visit until recently. I came here on two different days. The first visit was on a Tuesday and the restaurant was busy but I was able to quickly get a seat. The second time was on a Wednesday and the restaurant was extremely busy. I had to wait about 15 minutes for a seat.

The interior is very spacious and modern with lots of tables. They definitely need all of the tables they can get. I browsed through the menu and was hoping to see some familiar dim sum items, but there were few. I ordered the xiao long bao and the Lee Chen fried rice on my first visit. The XLB looked hastily made, but it was flavorful and the soup was tasty. I guess that's what matters the most. I thought the rice was very aromatic and flavorful. On the second visit, I ordered the XLB and the pulled pork bao. I was going to order the pan fried dumplings, but the waiter told me that it takes a long time to make. The baos were soft and sweet. The pulled pork was juicy, savory, and very tasty. The sauce was spicy.

Prices were reasonable. I'll definitely be back, but with reservations."}
{"text":"If you are looking for close to authentic Chinese cuisine downtown in a fast service setting, this is the place. 

Located close to the subway. As a vegetarian, I love their vegetable fried rice. The service is efficient and attentive. 

The decor, while ethnic, is modern and clean."}
{"text":"So I'm sure you know what Chinese food tastes like, right? No it really depends on where they from, orange chicken can be watery from the other orange chicken place down the road. Before you order any dish from this place be sure to take a look at it first. Yes I can taste the MSG!"}
{"text":"Over all I liked the place and would stop back in if ever in the area. The inside looked nice and clean but nothing unique. The servers were nice and attentive with the menu being pretty good with the selections. 
I had the soup dumplings which tasted really nice and the hot and sour soup was delish. The egg rolls however were very greasy. 
Other than that it was nice and you should try them."}
{"text":"I love dim sum but this shanghai style restaurant was very impressive. I had the xiao Lon bao and the peanut sauce noodle with chicken. Amazing! I'm currently obsessed with Taiwanese food and they had some good selection of that as well. My friend ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and loved how the beef was so tender and the soup wasn't overly spicy. The noodle itself was my fav! I may be wrong but I think it was handmade :) 

The dessert Tang Yuan is my current obsession and was excited when I saw this on the menu! (It's like Mochi with sweet sesame paste inside)

To top it off, the price was extremely reasonable so overall I was very happy with the experience here. Will highly recommend! The location is convenient too! :) right by Yonge/bloor station."}
{"text":"It was such a delightful place, all of the staff were so friendly, quick and helpful, AND THE FOOD WAS BEYOND DELICIOUS!  My family and I ordered 8 items off the menu, and each one impressed.  Honestly, I cannot say a single bad thing about this place!  I strongly recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Came here with my family on a Saturday night. I'm surprised how empty this restaurant is, given that it's downtown at a weekend dinner time. 

We ordered soup dumplings (great), braised eggplant (great, although a bit too saucy), braised tofu (the tofu didn't really have much flavour), and a shrimp lettuce wrap (great healthy option, although I didn't care for the regular hoisin sauce that came with it), with a small side of steamed rice. 

Great service and very speedy!"}
{"text":"**UBER EATS REVIEW** 

Ive ordered Lee Chen's off of uber twice now. Got the spicy beef noodle soup twice, its actually quite tasty especially since I'm not big on spice. The portion is generous and could definitely be split in two. I would suggest that they send one of the items in a larger bowl so they can be mixed though (noodles and broth come separately)  - with the size of bowl they currently come in the portions need to be halved in each container. 

overall a good experience - will probably order again sometime."}
{"text":"Came here dinner for 2 on a Monday at around 6pm and it wasn't busy. We were seated right away. Ordered mango and taro bubble teas which were really tasty and not too sweet. Soup-filled dumplings for an appetizer were amazing, 10/10 would eat again. Comes in 6pcs bite-sized. Ordered black pepper beef and BBQ chicken and egg fried rice for main dish. The beef was melt in your mouth tender, black pepper sauce was savory and on point, and vegetables cooked just right. The fried rice was flavorful and not greasy. This place was perfectly portioned and priced. My only complaint is that I couldn't eat more."}
{"text":"Great food! It was good quality Chinese food, clean restaurant, good presentation. They accommodated our two babies with strollers. Tried the chicken dumplings, fried shanghai noodles, pepper beef and general tsao chicken. Everything was tasty. The general tsao chicken was very spicy."}
{"text":"Been here twice for lunch and the place was busy both times. The atmosphere is buzzing and all the servers seem busy.  The interior design is Asian inspired with the wooden chairs and tables. Be sure to make reservations for a big group because it's packed during lunch. The service was mediocre, good thing the standard for the food was much higher.

Ordered noodles both times because noodles are definitely preferred over rice dishes. The first time there was definitely leftovers that had to be brought home. Even the family agreed that the crystal pork was amazing. The noodles on the other hand were plain with a lot of bean sprouts. The pork was the star and saved the noodles. The spicy beef noodle was great. The beef was tender, the soup had just enough spice and the noodles had the perfect texture, just the right amount of bite. Combined together it's something definitely worth ordering again. The portions are on the bigger side but that matches the cost.

Don't forget the fortune cookie on the way out. Overall, will definitely be back again for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been dying to find Shanghai dim sum in downtown Toronto. SURPRISED TO FIND THEM HERE!!!!

My strong cravings for Shanghai dim sum (#1 favourite food) are definitely satisfied for these reasons:
- Lee Chen is not westernized or whitewashed. Food isn't like crap from Spring Rolls
- dumplings are decent!! I've had WORSE Shanghai dim sum at Chinese dim sum restaurants. Lee Chen is good and I will return.
- prices aren't THAT bad.... This is Yorkville after all

Soup Dumplings (xiao long bao) $6.50 for 6
These are probably the tiniest xiao long bao dumplings I've ever seen, but they were pretty good. The soup isn't hot, there's a lot of soup, agree with Bernie that the meat is tiny. However the dumplings are still very very tasty. Also the skin isn't thick.

Pan Fried Pork Dumplings (wor teep) $6.50 for 6
These were alright, probably 3/5 in my books. My favourite of this dumpling is from a small mom & pop shop in First Markham Place food court. Shanghai restaurants in Markham could create 4/5. Lee Chen does 3/5 which I'd say is good enough in Toronto. They're softer (less fried), smaller-size dumplings, less filling, thicker skin.

Spicy Beef Noodles $11.95
I was afraid they'd serve a \"western\" size, but this dish surprisingly comes in a big bowl. You start digging into the bowl and you'll find that there are plenty of tender meats, enough noodles for 1, and lots of soup. I actually enjoy the noodles here!!! Jen K says they're not made in-house, however they DO taste like they're made in-house (chewy and aren't falling apart). The soup is pretty flavourful (NOT SPICY) and the beef is very tender (tasty enough, and of course I've had better). 

We actually ordered a second bowl of Spicy Beef Noodles!

The prices are decent for a Toronto \"fancy\"-looking Chinese restaurant. $11.95 for a big bowl of soup noodles is fantastic!! Okay yes this isn't Chinatown cheap, but Lee Chen is very clean, has good service, and the food is good. 

I'll be back!!

oh and: Bubble tea is actually yummy!!! (the price of BBT is fking expensive though, $4.95 + $0.50 for taprioca for A SUPER SMALL GLASS)"}
{"text":"This is not your typical Diner....In fact I have no idea why its called a Diner in the first place. Its really quite pretty inside, totally not what I expected. It's a pretty big space and very clean with dark wood running throughout, modern look with splashes of Asian decor and furnishings.  

The hostess eagerly greeted and took us to a booth. She placed the menu on the table along with a sheet and pencil. You just tick off the items you want and place it at the side when your done.

Green Tea arrives as a prepackaged bag from Ten Ren and a big thermos of hot water. I liked that they gave you a thermos of hot water so I didnt have to keep asking for more hot water.

Our orders included

Fiery Wonton - boiled pork filled wontons served in a delightful sweet & spicy Szechuan sauce
Tender meat in a steamed wonton, good balance of heat and sweet. About 8 pieces

Sesame Buns -baked pastry roll sprinkled with sesame seeds w/bbq chicken filling
Pastry was crispy with a slight sweetness and a mild bbq chicken filling. I've never had anything like this before, it was a good combo of sweet and savory. 2 pieces

Kung Pao Chicken - tender chicken slices stir fried with dry chillies and roasted cashew nuts, in a sweet & spicy sauce
Chicken was indeed tender, nice presentation, and big portion, I didnt find it very hot though.

Steamed rice

Overall service here was really good. They brought out dishes one at a time so we were not overwhelmed with dishes and asked before if that was ok with us. They kept the tables clear and glasses full. Dessert menu is lacking...they don't even have Green Tea ice cream here?? However waiters were really attentive and food comes out hot and fast and portions are reasonable especially for the price."}
