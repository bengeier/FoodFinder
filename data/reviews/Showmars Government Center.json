{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite before a meeting in the halls of the Government Center. The cajun chicken sandwich is out of this world and the make your own Arnold Palmer is always a great addition. Make sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"Staff is rude. They have to serve the same people over and over so they know us. Used to be nice before they signed the new contract and remodeled. Prices went way up after that. It's uncomfortable they are so rude. Sad."}
{"text":"Since its renovation last month, things are looking up. They have more inventory stocked so they're no longer saying they're out of this or that. The place is also much cleaner and fresh looking. 
Their gyro is why you want to visit. It is very tasty and is a hearty portion. The Taziki sauce is very good too. 
They also make a great gyro salad, especially with salmon added. It comes with puta bread and Taziki sauce. 
This Shomars is a great choice for government employees to eat at on their lunch break. They offer a 10% discount for them every Tuesday."}
{"text":"Convenient and cheap eats if you work around the government center or find yourself doing business nearby. Menu can be confusing because they change things frequently depending on what's available but other than that that, pretty to the point."}
{"text":"You've gotta get the fried fish sandwich! While down here for a conference, my coworker who was local convinced me I had to try the fish sandwich...and get one to take on the plane too. While the crinkle cut fries are uber tasty, they're not the most amazing thing I've ever had. The mac and cheese was a good call (more on the gooey side) and the fish, while messy, was simply astounding. All for approx $10 too. plus they're a local Charlotte family chain, which I absolutely adore. Service was prompt. The only thing is that they close at 3pm. 

If I ever get to come back to Charlotte, I'll pick up some Showmars!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. Very convenient to the Mecklenburg government center and adjacent to parking (paid).  

The classic double burger was very good but the flounder in the fish sandwich was a little stale and dry compared to the fresh moist tender fish sandwich we've enjoyed at the Huntersville Showmar's.  Food quality between locations is not consistent.  Ordering and service was good however."}
{"text":"After craving a Greek Salad all morning, I was trying to find somewhere I could grab a quick lunch,in uptown, and get back to the office.  However, my mind drew a blank, and feel like Greek Salads are hard to come by in uptown.  With that said, I thought I'd give Shomars a try, being that it was close, and I have the chicken pita before and liked. So, I ordered the Greek Salad with chicken and a side pf pita bread.  The chicken was cooked to perfection and the salad was good, very large too.  However, I found the dressing to be a little oily than what I prefer, but will definitely go back for the chicken pita again, love the tzatiki sauce!"}
{"text":"There's a certain point in southeast Uptown where the restaurants start becoming few and far between.  The Showmars at the Government Center pretty much has a captive market due to it's location and lack of restaurants surrounding.  I came during an off lunch time, but you can see the remains of the lunch crowd that pretty much destroys the restaurant (figuratively speaking).  You walk in, and there is a sign that explicitly says to form 3 lines and the cashiers will call you went its your turn.

If you are walking to the building, you will have to go through metal detectors since the building is a secure location.  It's a little strange to feel like you need to go through security just to go to a restaurant, but hey, I get it.

Typical Showmars menu here...   items are made to order and are quickly to you after they give you a number tent and you find a table.  Since I came after the lunch rush the staff had closed of some table sections to clean, it was a little awkward when you got \"fenced in\" but easy enough to move a chair to go get a drink refill."}
