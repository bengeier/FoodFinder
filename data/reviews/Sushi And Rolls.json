{"text":"Some one who eats sushi on a regular will tell you not to pay more then 50% of the price.

Lots of rice inside the role, and the fish is not fresh.

Price is  double of what it should really be.

Common Ajax, try some fresh fish between the 400 and the 404, and you will never look back"}
{"text":"Wow! Loved it! Excellent service, fast, friendly and delicious! We had the spider, volcano and rainbow.... With the drive for us, Will return:)"}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant that I have been to. The food is very delicious and comes quickly to the table. The staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"First time here and the sushi isn't bad. Had the lunch special, ordered from the menu not AYCE. I ordered 2 of the spicy salmon rolls and it came with soup and salad for $10.50. 


There was a hard piece of sharp rice on the second roll I ate. I showed the waitress and she got a man, that I'm assuming is the manager or owner, and I asked for a new one. He apologized and said that I can have one set of rolls for free. So I have 18 rolls (which is wayyy too many rolls for me). 

The rolls were decent. The place is clean. There are Tvs on the wall with the news playing. Staff were very kind. They checked up on me three times. 


I would return if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I started eating here on a whim about a year ago and it's been an absolute favorite in the area ever since. The quality of the food is amazing. Everything has a very authentic, homemade quality to it, as opposed to many other sushi restaurants where some food seems pre-packaged. A good example of this is their teriyaki, the sauce is just incredible and the cuts of meat or vegetables they use are always perfectly shredded and cooked. Beyond that, the menu is big and diverse. Try the teppanyaki for some delicious and tender barbequed beef, or the sparkle roll for a surprisingly delicious dessert roll. Top all of the great food off with wonderful, personable, servers who do their absolute best to serve you well, and fast, and it's easily one of the best sushi restauarants I've been to. Don't let the plaza location scare you, this is a great hidden gem."}
{"text":"The all-you-can-eat option here is not good. The food is fine, but we waited over half an hour for it in the second round. Both rounds, we had items missing. The servers are friendly, but it is just too slow."}
{"text":"Decent  sushi, not the best I've  ever had  but good. The AYCE is good, if there is an item you would like to try  that is not on the AYCE menu, they will make it for $2.99."}
{"text":"I won't go here anymore. I always found it expensive, but the service has gotten too bad as well. I went with my wife and son for a late dinner recently. All you can eat. A typical fill-out-the-sheet type of sushi order. Gyoza and sake served right away. One plate of 6 rolls came quickly. Then NOTHING for an hour.  Staff just disappeared. There were no other customers in the place. Eventually staff came out and told us that kitchen (for the hot stuff) wasn't making anything. They probably lost our order- what did we order, please? But what about the cold - the sushi, I asked? Why was it taking an hour in an empty restaurant? Staff pretended not to hear or understand me and tried to leave. Until I demanded an explanation. Other staff (sushi prep) came out and said it was because they were busy. I pointed out that restaurant was empty but for us. He looked around and said maybe there was a lot of takeout. I saw no takeout while I was there, and one delivery go out. BS. 

So he hugged me and said I should be happy, it was going to be okay. 

We cancelled most of the rest of the order, since we weren't really hungry anymore. 

No consideration of giving us a discount for bad service and not bringing us most of the food we ordered. 

$80 for two adults and an 8 year old to have sake, iced tea, gyoza, a few rolls and a dragon roll and ice cream. 

They were happy to take our money. 

I used to be here once a month. And my wife went more than that. Not anymore. Not after I was ripped off like that."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch.  Didn't look busy at all and yet we sat and waited for almost 45 min. No one came to take our order. Worst service I've experienced"}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs.  the rolls were horrible, sashimi was still frozen and thin, only thing i liked was the tempura.  I did all you can eat and regretted it.  Their advertising said one price and they charged us more and then apologized but still charged us more.  isn't that illegal.  They also charged us for our 2 year old that ate next to nothing.   I'll never come back here.  At first  they were hospitable but understaffed and totally rude when it came to the end of the meal.  I can't believe people are recommending this place.  
we all left disgusted"}
{"text":"Just happen to drive by and decided to eat there. The decor was nice and seemed like a good place to eat. The menu had a good variety but the pricing was expensive. Ordered the food and it was good. But then it started to go down hill from there. The service was awful. They were completely overwhelmed and the server comes by our table several times but does not serve us. We even had problems getting water.

If you want to go there for the food, I recommend take out or order at home. The prices don't make it worth to dine in. It will ruin your dinner."}
{"text":"Great authentic Japanese food with great service. Free wifi available too."}
{"text":"This place took over the Baywood Bakery which was a great place for Brekkie and brunch - one say the staff showed up and they were locked out and out of business... anyone know what happened there? :/ 


Anyways now we have lovely sushi to rave about!
This place seems pretty dead all the time but I'm sure once once people start coming in and word gets around, they will have a better stream of people coming in and out. 

I was here for the all you can eat sushi.
Good quality food and good portions.  Be careful not to order too much and not finish because if there are left overs you will be charged.
Order in smaller doses, you can always get more.  Of course my friends ended up ordering everyone is one shabang! lol  (of course them being boys).

We have an assortmant of salmon maki, deep fried tofu,sashimi, seaweed salad (Very yummy!), tempura and spider rolls.
Everything came fast and fresh.  We aren't talking about tiny little rolls either- this was the real full size stuffed with goodness.

Roughly $20 a person for dinner but well worth it. 

Hopefully this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"The website claims you can place an order for delivery and if you order less than $30, you pay a $4.00 delivery charge, (fair) so I called to order and was REALLY rushed by the server, she then alerted me I would have to pay an extra $6 because I live in an apartment (it's one block away) and ontop of that the additional $4 delivery charge. Then when my order came to $24, I was told they will not deliver unless I had $30 worth of an order plus $4 delivery PLUS $6 because I live in an apartment building. I used to really like this place but honestly they were super rude and it seems like a huge money grab which isn't cool"}
