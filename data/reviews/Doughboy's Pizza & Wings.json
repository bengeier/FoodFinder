{"text":"The pizza is fantastic! In 5 orders from Doughboy's, I have yet to find a pizza that wasn't delicious. I highly recommend the Double/Pepperoni-Double/Cheese specialty pizza. I did, however, bite into a bone in our \"boneless\" wings, so we'll call them \"bone-maybe\" wings. I jest. If anything, it shows that they're using real chicken. This is a great local place. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Perfect amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings! The crust was baked to a golden brown. We also tried their wings that didn't taste dried out like most places that cook their wings days ahead of time! We will definitely be back! The only turn off was the smell when you walk in,  it was like old chicken grease or something."}
{"text":"I ordered food here and got delivery. It took a little longer than expected. I ordered a white cheese pizza, there chicken dinner meal, and cheesy bread. The pizza was so bad I ate one slice and couldn't eat anymore. I gave my husband two slices on his plate. He took one bite and told me he couldn't eat that. It tasted like dough and a thin layer of cheese. Couldnt even taste the sauce and when I lifted the cheese I couldnt even see any sauce besides crust. The pressure cooked chicken however was delicious. The cheesy bread was for my husband and he liked it. Overall experience was ok. I just wont order that pizza again."}
{"text":"Wouldn't honor an entertainment book coupon i had. They tried to say it wasn't for a specialty pizza but it doesn't say that anywhere on the coupon. They said only up to a discount of $12 which it does say on the coupon. I said couldn't I just pay the difference then? It's the same thing as getting a free $12 pizza and I would be paying full price for the first one and the balance over $12 for the second one. They got rude and I told them I just won't order from you guys again and hung up the phone. The employee who answered was nice. The manager who got on the phone had a rude and nasty attitude. One time money is obviously more important than customer retention to them. They just lost a good one. They can keep their little coupon and their $12. In the long run they will lose lots more. I won't be back! I usually support local businesses but Good luck if you go to this one, I won't be treated like a stack of money! I'll call pizza cutter down the street from now on. Much better anyways. Just a little further."}
{"text":"This is a great pie. My father hates pizza but loves this place. My only complaint is that there are not enough pepperoni on the pizza but that isnt enough to cost it a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Another great, local pizza joint!  They have great pizza, wings, pressure-cooked fried chicken, pasta, sammiches and so much more!  The workers are friendly and you can tell that they appreciate your business.  Of course as with any non-mega chain pizza place, their prices are a bit more, but it's worth it to me.  They do have monthly specials with coupons in the Town Money Saver and you can sign up for their email list for more deals!  They also post specials on the marquee sign in their parking lot.  Their fried chicken is very good and juicy.  The pizza is great and they offer regular crust or thin.  I'll admit that the first time I had their pizza about 4 years ago when I moved to Avon Lake, it wasn't very good, but that was the only bad experience I've had there.  I usually decide between Doughboy's or Pizza Cutter, which is just a few miles east in Avon Lake.  Both places are great!"}
