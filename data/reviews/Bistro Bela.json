{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. From the service to the food to the way my beer was poured-- it disappointed at every turn. Just go to the Local, it's right across the street and actually pleasant."}
{"text":"I have thought long and hard before writing this review. It was Good Friday and this was one of the few places open so very excited. There was no staff and the only person manning the restaurant was the mother of the owner or waiter (couldn't understand her accent). She was kooky but pleasant. It became obvious she didn't know how to cook from the menu. I ordered the Bella burger and there was no caramelized onions or garlic aioli. She didn't know how to pour beer or know the beer or drinks selections. All she wanted to do was chat and didn't want to work. I felt so bad for her. Come on, if you love your mother would you do this to her? If you care about your business would you do this?"}
{"text":"I've been several times, both before and after the rebranding from BQM, and this just isn't worth the risk.  Sometimes the service and food is reasonable; but it's often just terrible.  Don't roll the dice.  The Local, the Cider House and even the Loon all have better, and more reliable, burgers and service."}
{"text":"very nice and apologetic server, but the food was awful. lamb burger tasted like freezer burn and my gf's burg didn't have the correct ingredients on it."}
{"text":"Excellent burger. Ordered from uber eats and it was still warm when it arrived. The meat was juicy and flavourful. Excellent all around!!"}
{"text":"I don't usually leave reviews, but this was a bad enough experience that I feel others should be warned. My girlfriend picked up food from here tonight (we live around the corner from this place). She had a BLT, which she said was quite good. I had a lamb burger, bad choice, it was inedible. Ordered as medium rare, but it came way over done. It was also covered in way too much goat cheese. I took the toppings off and even wiped the patty with a paper towel to redressed it, but it was still too dry to eat. Think I took about 3 bites and had to throw it out. Total waste of $14 for a \"burger\". Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"You would think that it is easy to find a medium of the road resto in  Roncesvalles, but alas it is (high is high and low is really low).  Bistro Bela does three things beer, bourbon, and beer. Check on all of them, good beer selection, juicy burgers (and even creative and great tasting salads) and a decent bourbon selection.   Beer, Burger, and Bourbon for less than $30. Great service and the owner is often your burger master."}
{"text":"This was a dry and flavourless burger.  The fries were stale as reheated or refried.  I also ordered bacon that didn't make it into the burger.  Bad use of over $30 for 2 burgers.   Will not come back, which is a shame because the  Neighbourhood is lacking for good burgers."}
