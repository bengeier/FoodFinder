{"text":"Delicious cheese steaks made the way you like them.  Cheese fries are sloppy but delicious.  Take out is quick."}
{"text":"Standard sandwiches with great flavor! Best service I have had in years. My husband had just had surgery and I tweaked my knee on the stairs so we decided to order dinner in but didn't want pizza. Looked this place up and called to see if they delivered to our area and they said yes. We ordered the cheese steak and Italian sandwiches and steak fries ( get the steak fries). It took a little while to get here and we really hadn't noticed but the shop called to apologize for the wait. The shop owner delivered our order and said he was sorry it took so long but there was a mistake on the order he had to fixed and that he wouldn't be charging us for the meal. Having worked in a service job for a decade I was surprised at how nice we were treated.  For me service and consideration is a large part in my decisions to continue to visit places especially restaurants. No doubt we will be back here again!"}
{"text":"After waiting two and a half hours for my food and calling four times the woman I spoke too blamed me for not answering my phone. The reason I did not answer was because they called the wrong number, which they also typed incorrectly on the receipt which the driver showed me while he apologized for the stupidity of his coworkers. The food was horrible. I fed it to my dog.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"After living down the street from Philly's for ~7 months, i decided to check it out. For the price of a cheesesteak (i got the equivalent of a 6 inch), which is very reasonable (under $6), i definitely recommend them.  The sandwich, I got the Chicken Cheesesteak, and it was a good sandwich for the price but was a bit par for the course  Giving two stars because of that and the fries.  Avoid them at all costs.  They're overly salted, you can only order them in one size, and the fries in my order were either overly crispy and crunchy  or a soggy mess.  I'd recommend Philly's for a movie night or similar event when you want to get quick sandwiches to eat. All in all, i was mildly impressed but don't think i'll rush to return."}
{"text":"Currently sitting at 2 (TWO) hours waiting for delivery that I ordered off Grub Hub from here. We got a pizza, wings and a cheesesteak and fries.  TWO.  HOURS.  On a Tuesday evening with no sporting events or other extenuating circumstances going on.  On the off chance this is literally the best food I'll ever eat in my entire life, I will never order from here again. They tossed me a 10% discount and said, \"I don't know, the delivery guy got stuck in traffic, I honestly couldn't tell you,\" when I called to ask what the hell was going on.  We just got it as I finished that. As I suspected: waxy, microwaved pizza, the worst cheesesteak I've ever had, and soggy, unsalted fries. The fact that they somehow managed not to screw up the wings is a minor miracle entirely overshadowed by how overwhelmingly terrible that food was. Atrocious from beginning to end. Never again."}
