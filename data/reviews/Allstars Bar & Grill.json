{"text":"Drinks are cheap and well made during the day but I will not eat here as I witnessed a cook in washroom and after he finished he didn't wash his hands and just left the washroom.  Gross.  

Sorry but I don't want someone cooking and touching my food who has just touched his dirty penis or scrubbed his arse.

This place become infested with ghetto babies and power drinkers after dark so not a safe place to bring your date."}
{"text":"Came here with my lady and was just taken by the drug dealing dudes were involved in infront of our faces. People walk in talk to a couple of dudes and off they were with what they came for, loud hardcore hip hop, lack of service, servers looked like laid off strippers, food wasn't fresh and the sketchy clientele. 

Now just read that this place shut down and arrested 3 dudes for cocaine traffickingdoesn't surprise me... place should've been shut down after the murder that's happened there his past summer. Good riddance!"}
{"text":"Horrible atmosphere....was meeting my wife there for dinner at 5pm Friday - thinking it was the \"all stars\" franchise chain but was shocked when I arrived. Shady people hanging around the front door, waitress looked extremely exhausted or intoxicated. No couples or families were eating inside either. I took a table in the patio where a guy approached me and tried to sell me weed- who appeared very high himself. After several attempts, he finally went back to the bar. At this moment, I messaged my wife to not come inside as she was already on her way. I then rushed out the door to my car and sped off. Ghetto place!!"}
{"text":"Went to see friends play... Not too impressed with the environment but the service was good"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall bar completely unrelated to the All Stars chain of pubs. Someone described it as \"seedy\" and without disparaging their customers I can't disagree that that word at does least come to mind.

The wings, described as the best wings in town, were pretty average and in fact very much over-sauced. The value was very good though with 2 pounds costing about $13 (no sides).

It's not that I wouldn't go back, but with so many other places to go I'm not sure why I'd ever have to."}
{"text":"There is almost zero reason to go here *unless* you drove your boyfriend to the airport, missed the flight, have 5 hours to kill, and develop an evangelical drive to take this 27 year old man on a healthful nature excursion at Claireville Conservation Area, after which you promise to Yelp-out the nearest chicken wings locale, so he can \"rebalance\". 

Food was totally fine for a bar by the highway. Service was friendly!"}
