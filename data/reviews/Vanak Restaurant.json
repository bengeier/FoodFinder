{"text":"Came here in the area to eat practically anything, and to my surprise found a friend chicken place basically across from Popeyes and decided to try it. The staff are kind and friendly, I think this place is mainly used for take-out as the plates and cutlery resemble a fast food place, tacky plastic plates etc. The chicken was fine on the other hand, they have a few specials for slightly over a dollar per piece and fries were fine as well. Overally if you are in a rush for chicken for a party or something it wouldn't hurt to come here. Chicken was more like KFC, and is greasy compared to Popeyes'. It wasn't overdone or anything, and I thought it was decent."}
{"text":"This place has an identity crisis. It can't decide if it is a burger place, a pizza joint or a fried chicken house. You know the expression, jack of all trades...

I was very disappointed with the chicken, which was at previously their main fair. It had little meat, was over cooked and bland.

While the deals may seem a like a steal, there is very little value in what they are offering.

In all fairness, I have not tried their other items, but if their main attraction was that poorly executed, I have little desire to explore."}
