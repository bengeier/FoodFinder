{"text":"Huge fan of Braut Haus and was not disappointed with Smoke Haus! Best new addition on Scottsdale Road. Great assortment of meat options, really inventive sides - my faves was the pork belly Mac 'n cheese and the bleu kale salad."}
{"text":"I went 2 nights already. First night I had the ABT's for an appetizer and the  ribs w/ a dbl kale salad side. Loved all of it and even shared w/ the two gentleman on each side of me, total strangers but it was so good and large portions that I couldn't finish all of it by myself.  I went back again Sunday night w/ my girlfriend and once again had to order the ABT's so she could try them and got the Salmon for my dinner entry.  Once again shared our apps w/ strangers at the bar and had a great time. My Salmon was cooked perfectly, girlfriend loved her Rib dinner w/ a dbl Mac & Chs side and the gentleman to my left said he liked his Rattlesnake Chili. 
The restaurant/bar area had a nice feeling and I can't wait to sit under the huge tree out on the patio."}
{"text":"I was here the other night and I've been reading about this place they have pretty good food in here I like that pork belly mac and cheese the closest pretty good to have that tri-tip plate pretty tasty I would recommend this place to anybody"}
{"text":"Tender and smoky tri -tip sandwich. Focus was on the meat, and it was good. Well though out beer list. I will return."}
{"text":"Worst BBQ I've ever had. The sides were also horrible. Nothing had flavor and the meats were not smoked or grilled. The place was pretty empty and it took over an hour to get our food. 
   We will never be back. Terrible!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner at the new Smokehaus in Old town Scottsdale the other night! Very pleased with the whole experience! Friendly staff, awesome place cool decor and some delicious food. Had the Taco Salad it was on point! Good work guys definitely be back."}
{"text":"Superspectacular place with BBQ that is worthy of even the most pickiest BBQ lover! Kenny more than impressed us with his knowledge behind the bar and his friendly manner was extremely inviting and refreshing. I highly recommend this place for the food and atmosphere!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there despite a low rating on Yelp. Place was empty as in the only two people there were us. The food came out and it was cold, apparently they smoke the meat during the day and leave it in a warmer for the rest of the night had to sent it back. On the second try it was a little better but still not hot as I am used to eating . Either way won't be going back therefor dinner this might be lunch spot only."}
{"text":"Been here three times and love this place. The BBQ is so tender and juicy. Don't forget to save some time for the desserts. The chocolate cake is out of this world."}
{"text":"We had 3 generations of family there Sunday.  Grandma and Son loved that they had some Stone Brewery choices on draft.  Daughter and kids loved that they had Big Red on the soft drink list...hard to find that anywhere.  For entrees, pulled pork was very tender, juicy and flavorful, tri tip was up to Son's and Granddaughter's standards, and Child's Plate hot dog satisfied Grandson. The service was good and friendly, and the prices are family friendly too."}
{"text":"Tri tip sandwich top shelf.  Service friendly and fun.  Beer selection excellent.  Looking forward to a return visit"}
{"text":"We found Smokehaus when walking and decided to give it a try. I ordered the chicken / tri tip combo with kale salad and mac 'n cheese.  My husband ordered the tri tips with mac 'n cheese and grilled broccoli. 

The mac 'n cheese was good, my hubby loved it. The broccoli was cooked perfectly. The kale salad was nice, but it has a heavy blue cheese dressing. I'd have preferred something lighter with the mac 'n cheese, but it was tasty. 

The beef was really good, but the chicken was divine! Seriously, it's the best bbq chicken I've ever had. 

Heads up, the tri tips are served at room temperature. It's by design. They're smoked, then grilled, then allowed to rest."}
{"text":"If you are craving good smoked meat, skip this place.  The tri-tip is tough and under cooked.  The chicken wings were raw and ceasar salad coated in fish sauce."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for a romantic evening and this didn't quite provide the vibe we were looking for - its very casual. The food was great but the waiter didn't actually listen when we gave our orders so both mine and my husband's sides were wrong when they came out and they ended up charging for both the correct and incorrect sides. Unfortunately for them, they didn't have the excuse of being busy as it was a slow Wednesday night with no major sporting events going on (they have large TVs for watching sports) That being said, I can't give it an awful review as the food was great - tender meat and satisfying portions - just wish they had better customer service."}
{"text":"Great parking free parking, love smoked meat... Ill be back often...

Had a bar as well so we can get everything in one stop..

I was alzo pleased to get Rc Cola there, grew up on that.... 

Ordered ABT as apitizer at manager Scotts recomendation. Well worth it thanks"}
{"text":"I'll start with the good: the outdoor patio was great, the service was excellent, the drinks were nice and cold.  But I think it's sad when the best part of a BBQ dinner is the Texas toast.  Smokehaus has some great Texas toast. That's about it.  We ordered a few things to get a good variety of flavors and none were very good.  The pork ribs were extremely dry and very tough - to the point where it was just too much work to eat them.  The appetizer we ordered had such promise - jalepenos stuffed with sausage and cheese and then wrapped in bacon.  I could barely finish one, the taste was just off and not appetizing at all.  We also ordered the pork belly macaroni and cheese.  The noodles were so soft and mushy and it didn't really have a very cheesy taste either.  Also, the place was empty on a Saturday evening, maybe that should have been a sign.  Ya, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Found this place on accident. Best accident that ever happened. Food was exceptional the service was fantastic! Our server Claire was mostly responsible for our exceptional experience. She was attentive knowledgeable and fun. This could become my new regular hangout."}
{"text":"This place was delicious the tri-tip, chicken and pulled pork. Gave 3 stars because the sides weren't that great. Ranch beans tasted like spaghetti sauce with beans in it .."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Words can't describe how bad the service was. Hoped the food would save the day but it was disappointing too. Tri-tip was tough and tasteless. Bad service wasn't limited to our table. Other patrons were frustrated too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and has weekend happy hour! Can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu. We had the wachos which were incredible! Everything is made from scratch!"}
{"text":"They messed up our reservation. The service was very poor. The food was decent, but nothing noteworthy. Overall, it was a disappointing dining experience."}
{"text":"So... I was all excited to hear a Santa Maria style barbecue place was opening up in Scottsdale.  I looked at the website, read about it on AZCentral, watched a segment on Fox 10 and the more I heard, the more apprehensive I became. It just did not seem like Santa Maria style. But we bit the bullet and gave it a try hoping for the best. 
     Walking into the place, it seemed like it could have been uprooted from the Central Coast, dark wood, big tables, a nice grill in front but what the heck was a smoker doing here?  There are no smokers in Santa Maria. There were also piles of wood stacked around the patio that they call red oak. California Coastal Red Oak is the wood of choice but that ain't it. Not sure what they were trying to pass off but it goes with the rest of the charade.  We were quickly seated by a manager who was very nice and accommodating, we had a nice place on the patio and the weather was great. 
     Next concern, bbq sauce on the table.  There is no bbq sauce in Santa Maria style barbecue. Silly. Our waitress was very nice and I was pleasantly surprised that they had Firestone 805 on tap, hadn't seen that outside the central coast.  The food menu was pretty big but the only meats that were Santa Maria-esqe were the tri-tip and the chicken, so I ordered the chicken/tri-tip plate with beans and the Mac and cheese. My wife had the veggie burger with a Caesar Salad. 
     Tri-tip is a tricky meat to cook, best served medium rare. But this is where that random smoker came in, the place first grilled the meat and then smoked it to well-done. Well-done tri-tip is dry and tasteless. Alas, this was dry and tasteless. I will say the chicken was excellent, juicy and flavorful. I would order that again. When the waitress came by to ask how everything was, I asked for salsa, as salsa is a standard part of Santa Maria style barbecue. She seemed surprised by the request and told us they had no salsa in the entire restaurant.  WTF? 
    Ok next thing, Santa Maria beans are a little pink bean called pinquitos which are not cooked sweet.  They are savory with chile powders and onions and transcendent when done right. The crap beans they served were sweet and definitely not pinquitos.  The Mac and cheese was tasteless and gluey. My wife's veggie burger was dry so she had to make use of the bbq sauce. We finally understood why it was there. The salad barely had any flavor. I did enjoy the toast that was included but again not Santa Maria style. 
    Overall I liked the space, the service was solid and the chicken was excellent but the place is just another bbq place. Nothing but using tri-tip makes this a Santa Maria style restaurant so before they continue using that term, they should first find Santa Maria on a map and maybe make a visit. The roadside open pit places that are set up every weekend blow the doors off the Smokehaus. And remember when you are looking for Santa Maria on a map, it's in California not the south.
      No matter how many of the owners friends put in fake reviews, the place is still not good. Oh well"}
{"text":"Food was awesome!! Wide beer selection, friendly and fun bartender. Totally worth it and I'll be back for sure.  Tri tip was perfect and plentiful."}
{"text":"Finally a place that serves Santa Maria Tri Tip. I use to bring it home whenever I visited Santa Ynez California. It has been years and Smoke haus nailed it, cooked perfectly with all the flavor I remember. I had with grilled shrimp which was also very good.  Clean,open place that is ready to serve a crowd. I will bring the company for happy hour."}
{"text":"The tritip is perfect, Santa Maria style! Enjoyed the pulled pork walcjos & porkbelly mac & cheese! Will be going ba k ag s in.& again!"}
{"text":"fries were fresh and crispy.  basic burger was $7.50 with no sides and on the  dry side.  2 salt shakers weren't dispensing properly. good beer selection.  wine was average. but not expensive.  smokehouse burger was 9.75 plus we paid extra for multiple cheeses and didn't get.  Staff were friendly but didn't work to engage.   3 weeks open.  good luck."}
{"text":"Not sure the smoked wings were actually smoked? The Mac and cheese was good but was only available as a side and therefore a small portion. Happy hour was limited but the patio and atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Went to Smokehaus during Spring Training. Was very excited for the Tri-tip. The whole experience was very disappointing. Cornbread was dry and lacked flavor. Ordered the Tri-tip rare and it was at least medium and lacked both smoke and flavor. The smokiest thing on the menu was the broccoli that came with the grilled vegetables. My mom got the shrimp and they were too salty to eat and she adds salt to everything. It was the waitress' first day and she tried but seemed very untrained. I tried to order a side of extra pork ribs and she said I could but the kitchen later said no. I also had to get more utensils and condiments for the table as there were not enough for the number of guests. I would say that I won't go back next year but I don't think they'll be around by then."}
{"text":"Did a quick check on this new place owned by the guy next door. They have good happy hour prices on domestic drafts as I have been seeking the elusive $2 happy Hour draft. There are other discounts on craft beers also, but only four specials on food for HH and the back patio  only has tables and nowhere to mingle to just enjoy the weather. The big smoker also takes up a good chunk of the patio. The rest of the interior looks like they spent no money as it is basically the same look as the last tenant. Not a fan of this sort of BBQ (and frankly this style is not something that needs to leave CA), but the good HH should get me back a few times. Taco Haus failed in North Scottsdale, but if you have money to throw around, you try again."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good BBQ place and though the tri tip was good it wasn't anything special the Mac n cheese was very dry and no flavor the beans had a sea food taste to it. I won't be going back not worth the cost and the wait to be seated when there so many tables were available."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm saddened that I cannot recommend this place. After asking twice for ice water as well as our drinks, my wife secured water from the bar.

The tri-tip was nothing special and tougher than it should have been. I found the Mac and cheese to be unfavorable and dry. The Kale salad was soggy and had a funky flavor.

This is our second disappointment in Scottsdale, I'm thinking this is not a place for \"foodies.\"

Cap'n Lefty call's for a \"go-around\" and find an alternate."}
{"text":"We celebrated my daughter's ASU graduation with a group of 9 for lunch. The service was excellent. We ended up trying quite a few appetizers. All of them were amazing. The prickly pear margarita is as good as it looks. The wings were my favorite. I'm not a big meat eater, but I sampled the tri tip and it was really good. Ended with the chocolate sheet cake. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I love the vibe here ! The whole staff are happy and helpful . 

Q was our server and he was awesome! The food is very good here and we can not wait to try other items !"}
{"text":"I won't be back any time soon. The service terribly slow, the order was not delivered correctly, and the lack of customer service overall was mediocre at best. I'm not sure what the deal was, however, there are much better options in the are that have much better service and food."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!  We came in and put our name in.  We're told it would be awhile.  After 30 minutes checked again and were told if we wanted we could go somewhere else.  We asked a server if we could sit at one of the many open tables inside and were told sure no one is waiting.  A waitress promptly came up and asked for our order before we even received menus.  We all ordered sandwiches(FYI this is ala carte, no sides).  Way too over priced for sandwiches only!!  We received our sandwiches and all 4 felt like they came out of the fridge.  Sent all of them back.  They all came back cold again.  I strongly recommend that you stay away.  The owner should stick with hotdogs, this BBQ sucks!!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once so far, but I will be back.  I am a big fan of the Brat Haus next door (same owners) and so my hard choice will be which purveyor of prepared animal flesh will process my credit card on that particular day.

Nice large interior (unlike the smallness of the neighbor to the south).  We were a party of ten for happy hour and there was plenty of space and options for us inside.  We tried a few appetizers, ABTs, jalepeno sausage and smoked cheddar and the smoked wings.  ABTS are fine, though not out of this world. The sausage was dead on, moist, flavorful and worthy of a try.  The cheddar was ok, but juxtaposed to the sausage it was a nice touch.  The wings were a disappointment, the were definitely under done.  When I asked to have the cooked more, the waiter noted that smoked chicken is often pink.  I know this as an avid smoker of meats, but these were not pink muscle meat, but bloody joins and veins.  Not pretty. even when they went back and came to me a second time they were not quite cooked to my liking.  next time I will ask that they over cook them - crispy.

I will be back, others were excited about the pulled port or tri-tip nachos.  next time."}
{"text":"Visit for a late dinner near closing time and were warmly greeted and seated and served our drinks without delay.  I had the Tri Tip plate which had excellent flavors nice and smokey, not an easy cut to cook correctly.  Sides consisted of beans and mac both were above par but I might double up on the beans next time.  Dining partner had a burger or sandwich, not sure which one but the plate was empty when we left so assuming that it was good too.  There were two BBQ sauces within reach, I like them both and being unable to decide which one was better I mixed them together."}
{"text":"Very cute server and hostess. That brought me in and enjoyed the ambiance. I ordered a 1/2 lb burger and asked for lettuce wrap rather than bun. It came out small and not to appealing. No lettuce wrap, but this isn't California. So the patty was smoked and tasty, but the only other thing on the plate was potato chips. A $7.00 beer and a burger patty cost me $25 including tip..."}
{"text":"Not a good smoke on the cue. Everything was just average 1990s BBQ. Ribs had gross sauce on them and tasted like the oven baked grocery store kind. Cornbread dry. Fries soggy. Service okay. This place won't last."}
{"text":"This place is NOT what it says it is. Brat Haus next door is better. This sister restaurant says it's a smokehouse, but it's not. 

First of all you cannot smell it... I should have known before I entered that something was up. The ambiance is casual. We sat outside and it's pretty. The service was so slow and bad. Took forever to get us anything we asked for. 

The food....OMG, it was BAD. This is not smoked meat. It is pricey for what it is. If you look at my pictures you'll see that it didn't looked liked a smoked meat. The tri tip was dry and tough, fatty...BAD. It came out cold after a long wait. I let the waitress know. It wasn't even warm. I hate writing reviews like this, but I wanted be honest. They took it back and were back in less than 5mins. It was warm in spots, so I'm pretty sure it was microwaved. :( I really wanted to like this place. The fries are frozen fries and the brussels sprouts  had no seasoning. 

Try any where else and come by if you'd like $2 Miller light for happy hour."}
{"text":"This place is very homey and if you are one for watching your weight, abort mission! The menu alone will make you drool and the drinks are tasty! I can't wait for dessert, the Texas sheet cake sounds like happiness! They even have Not Your Father's Root Beer on tap"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here tonight and we were not disappointed. We walked in and were approached seated almost immediately by the manager. He was very nice and helpful. Our waitress was super nice and very punctual throughout our meal.

To start we had the Wachos, they were really tasty. My husband had the Tri Tip which was  so so good! My son had the Tri tip Sandwich which was equally good. I myself had the Salmon and it was cooked to perfection! So much flavor in all of our main courses. 

My only complaint is the side dishes. We had the pork belly mac, street corn, and the bbq beans. None of which were to our complete liking but certainly within a good food standard. My favorite side was actually the garlic texas toast that was more of a garnish. But very delicious. Maybe the others sides just weren't meeting our personal taste.

The pricing and atmosphere were on point for what we were expecting as a family with 2 smaller kids."}
{"text":"Great new place ... Love the casual vibe. I felt like I was back in Central CA at a cool hole-in-the-wall bbq joint. Chicken sandwich was amazing, and if the pork belly mac & cheese was a person I would marry it. Amazing apps (try the bacon-wrapped jalapeño bites) too. I thought the service was great, despite the reviews saying otherwise. They just opened a few weeks ago so maybe they are working out the kinks, but we didn't have any problems. Definitely recommend! Cool addition to this part of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"As someone who grew up in Santa Maria, CA. I was very excited when I saw the Smokehaus advertising Santa Maria style Tri-Tip. Sadly, what they are advertising and what they are serving are completely unrelated to each other beyond both being meat. First off, the steak they were calling Tri-Tip is NOT Tri-Tip. Sirloin maybe, Tri-Tip no. Secondly it was still extremely rare, almost raw, even when ordered well done. Third, when ordered as a steak, not a sandwich, I expect it to be thick, not lunch meat thin. The sides were satisfactory but lackluster, probably due to the pathetic 'steak' they had to accompany. If you enjoy a good steak, avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place and was disappointed. Not with the food because unfortunately I never got to try it. I sat there for 15 minutes and was never acknowledged by a server and the place was pretty dead so I left."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved everything about this place!  Chicken wings were best I ever had.  Had the 1/2 chicken dinner with the blue kale salad and veggie side...Clean plate yummy.  The skin on the chicken was thin and crispy the kale salad was amazing...the bbq sauces are delicious and the smokiness of the food is perfect and not overwhelming like alot of other smokehouse restaurants.  Visit Sam at the bar...great service and knowledgeable about the different beers and the menu."}
{"text":"When I heard that Union Barrel House was going out of business I had hoped something great would move in to fill the void. Unfortunately, Smokehaus fell short. For starters the beer list isn't all that impressive. But the real issue was the food. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and it was just OK. Wasn't a lot of meat/slaw on the sandwich; mostly dominated by the slightly dry bun. Additionally there are no fries on the menu, received a side of Ruffles potato chips. My date ordered the tri-tip salad. She was extremely disappointed in the quantity of the quality ingredients (very little cheese, steak and walnuts but a whole bunch of lettuce). She said that although the salad had a good flavor, the lack of food was a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Frank admits he had high hopes for
The BBQ Smokehouse located in Old Town Scottsdale but was disappointed , I guess YELP reviews didn't lie...

Upon entering I was intoxicated by the smell of BBQ Mesquite wood burning and flesh... But my short lived ecstasy ended when my food arrived. The rattlesnake chili was like a think goo with no liquid in it, I'd say More like a chili paste. Very unsatisfactory for chili in the South West so be warned. Now the signature Santa Maria Tri Tip sandwich underwhelmed me because the meat was dry and bun not fresh. The perfect sandwich but have a soft bun and not a day old tasting bun that's semi hard & crusty.. And last but not least who serves cans of soda at a restaurant ( OMG ) how tacky..

I will note the bar looked amazing so I'm sure bellying up to the bar should not be an issue gather people in, but the food needs some TLC. You've got a wonderful location and building but  fix the menu."}
{"text":"I love the tri-tip, yum! Kale salad was tasty and the cobbler is to die for. Try the prickly pear margarita too! Great location, friendly staff and free parking."}
{"text":"First time at the smokehaus, in Scottsdale, AZ! I ordered the wings and a couple craft draft brews. I must say, they know what their doing! The wings are char-grilled with three killer bbq/hot options. Overall, very pleased with the food and the selection of American craft brew! I'll definitely be checking this place out once again!"}
{"text":"Oh because you're a professional BBQ eater. Like you are so excited to finally have a platform to speak your mind on BBQ. Shhhh...

I loved this place. And while I haven't summered in Santa Maria, I certainly know good BBQ and even more so, good service when it's standing across the bar from me. Steve was super (and not just his beard) - attentive, conversational, and on top of our orders. My fiancé and I didn't wait long for our salmon (mine, because I'm sweating for the wedding) and tri tip plate (his, because he's smoking hot already) with sides of pork belly mac and cheese and fries because PORK BELLY MAC AND CHEESE - all cooked to perfection and super flavorful. Not at all overdone (tri tip was actually quite rare - yum) and moist *shudder* 

The owner, Dave (shout out to Brat Haus next door) even came by to check in on us, which I appreciate. Cool vibe, non-pretentious clientele (minus the Santa Maria snobs) and great food. Yay for another chill Old Town joint. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The place certainly looks and smells the part.  Once they get a few of the noted service kinks out of the way I am confident that this will become the defacto BBQ spot for patrons of Oldtown.  The BBQ sauce and pork ribs stood out as favorites.  We wanted to love the signature tri tip sandwich more but it was a little too tough for our liking.  

We may be miles and miles from Central California and the PCH but this place at least gives us a small taste of the experience."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my experience at Smokehaus.  I conversed with the chef, manager, and owner all of which were extremely friendly and entertaining to talk with.  
I wanted to try a variety of tastes the menu had to offer and the staff was willing to accommodate my desires.
I ended up getting pulled pork, chicken, tri tip, blue kale salad, ranch beans, Texas toast, pork belly mac and cheese, as well as the ABT's and wachos, and texas sheet cake. 
The trip tip had a beautiful pink color and was very tender.  The pulled pork was as if it melted in my mouth and loaded with flavor as well as the chicken.  The chicken had the perfect crunch on the outside and the perfect moistness on the inside.  The pork belly mac and cheese was very good, and was delighted when I saw this on the menu.  The Kale salad was very light but it was tasty and I am not the biggest fan of blue cheese.  The ranch beans were good and offers a bit of surprise with chucks of tri tip in it. The ABT's and Wachos were bomb, I came during happy hour and decided on these appetizers as they came highly recommended, I was not disappointed at all! 
However, a warning, the Texas sheet cake was delicious as this is one of my favorite cakes, but it is such a big serving, definitely a piece of cake that would be good for three to four people. 
Good serving portions, great food, and friendly staff. Don't know what much you could ask for."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but the staff is not ready fro prime time. Maybe they opened without proper training, but a simple lunch took far too long was marred by multiple mistakes by the staff. Inattentive on a day with very few patrons, unexplained delays in service, no apology, so sugar, no refills. The Brat Haus has been fine in the past but the SmokeHaus needs a significant improvement in their customer service."}
{"text":"The service-terrible. Food-not worth it. 

I am very disappointed and won't be going back. I ordered a sandwich....they took 60 minutes to bring it out and then brought out the something I didn't order (and due to food restrictions don't actually eat). The waiter then told me that the wrong sandwich would be on the house (duh) and they would put in an order for the actual order at that time (....great another hour??). Sandwich came out in 30 minutes. It was not great. The meat was badly charred and really...not worth the wait. There are better restaurants in that area so that's that for me!"}
{"text":"The place was maybe half full but we were told before being seated that the food would take over an hour.  Pass.  They need to get it together.

Taco Haus all over again?  It seems these guys can do brats and nothing more."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Had the pork BBQ sandwich last night. So delicious, decided to come back for lunch today. Had the tri tip. Cooked perfectly. Tender and cut in strips. The baked beans are amazing. I'm from Texas so I know my BBQ.  Glad I found this place. 

Service is impeccable. Kenny is very attentive!  Thank you."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.   When the BBB burger finally arrived it was pretty good but had to ask for salt & pepper. Why aren't shakers on the table?  Never did get a drink refill and the wait for my check was excruciating. Awful service.   Someone mentioned the ribs,  best in Scottsdale are at  Dickey's."}
{"text":"Walking around old Scottsdale saw this place and decided to stop with my family.  Anything BBQ on Memorial Day sounds like great idea.  

We ordered the Wachos for appetizer, which is a mixture of waffle fries, beans, cheese, ranch, BBQ sauces and pulled pork.  That's stuff was delicious but then they took it away in the middle of us eating it. Cause I order it without Green chili and they gave us the wrong one.  They brought us another one back and again was good. 

We then ordered ribs, tri-tip, tri-tip w/ chicken and a burger.   My tri-tip came with Mac and cheese and fries.  Tri-tip was bloody almost uncooked, fries were burned and hard.  Mac was actually good.  I asked for them to take the tri-tip back as it still smell like raw meat.   My wife ribs were also overdone. Hard to take off the meat off the bone even with a fork and knife.  They just over cooked them by hours I would say. 

Absolutely disappointing."}
{"text":"Nice place with some tasty food. The staff is very upbeat and pleasant, the smokey smell is so enticing it will pull you in off the street. Happy Hours are very agreeable as well. Where else can you get Blue Moon for $2 (3-6pm) and you gotta try the Wachos which are only $5 during HH!!!
      If you're in Old Town Scottsdale swing on by, it's worth the trip. Oh yea they always sell 10 oz. PBR for 99 cents !!!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection, inviting space, service was ok. But why three stars? The \"signature\" tri tip was overdone and served on a doughy dry roll, with some super sweet sauce that was the only thing we could taste. I know tri tip is a tricky cut to cook as its lean and not very tender. Done right it can be fantastic. But cooking it to well and serving it on a thick dry roll with some sickly sweet sauce is highly unsatisfying. I'll give this place another try but if tri tip is going to be their signature dish they need to step it up. Lose the sauce, get a smaller roll, cook it medium rare, and maybe include some of the drippings on the bun to add flavor and moisture."}
{"text":"Here on opening day.  This is a special place, Santa Maria style bbq is easily found along the Pacific coast in California but is very rare here in AZ.  Different wood, simple rubs and of course tri-tip are what set this apart from regular bbq fare. Tri-tip sandwich was very good. Decent tenderness and perfect bread for this sandwich. See picture."}
{"text":"First off.. I am a tri-tip SNOB... And #sonofabitch, the meat here certainly does NOT disappoint.. Cooked perfectly. Juicy, pink, and the flavor... Omg. Oh and the  Mac and cheese : bomb..  My hot ass fiance got the salmon plate and, same result.. Straight up - When Harry Met Sally status.. 100% worth it. We'll be back soon.. like lunch tomorrow soon homes. The bartender Steve was cool and had great reccomendations.. The owner came and checked on us and even invited us next door for a tour of Brauthaus.. Do yourself a favor muchacho, come Czech this place out.. You'll be back. Mattandemilypowpow.."}
{"text":"Beer - Much less selection compared to the former Unionhouse, seems like they even have better drafts next door at Brathaus. Also, happy hour didn't apply to drafts, just domestics.

Food - Started with hot bbq chix wings, they are really good. Moist, nice tang to the sauce. I was unimpressed with the tri-tip sandwich, was very dry. Literally just meat on a bun, wish I would of gotten a side of pickles or slaw to help with the dryness. Meat itself was good, tender. Wife got the salmon sandwich, she described it as average. 

Increase the beer selection and I'll be back for happy hour! Skip the dinner...

Need BBQ? Wait in line @ Little Miss"}
{"text":"Like Scottsdale in general, all style & no substance. Wings...undercooked and pink. Signature Tri Tip was grilled but definitely not smoked. Tough, chewy & utterly forgettable. Sides were borderline nasty and the staff was rarely to be found. If not for wayward tourists, this place would be mercifully dead in three months time. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"My husband and I were actually big fans of Smokehaus overall! The ambiance is pretty casual and cute, what you would expect from a bbq joint. I was a little worried when we arrived and there was barely anyone there during prime lunch hour, but it turned out to be a great experience! My husband got the tri tip sandwich & I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. One thing I will say that was slightly disappointing was that the 9-10 dollar sandwiches didn't include any sides with them, which seemed a bit silly. I understand this is somewhat common with bbq restaurants, but the pricing seemed a little steep for what we got. Both of us really loved our food though! The fries were crispy & hot, and I really enjoyed their bbq sauce. Both of our sandwiches were delicious and I was very happy that their pulled pork was not fatty at all. Our waitress was very attentive and sweet, and we walked away happy and full! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Got the tri tip & chicken, sausage sandwich and cornbread. All were GREAT. Potato salad was great, pickles were oddly good, and a great selection of beers. We came very close to closing, they were more then accommodating. Nothing but good things to say about it."}
{"text":"No Briskett....slow service...order came out wrong....no lemon or sugar for the iced tea....grilling tri  tip before smoking...terrible mistake....very tough....however the Blues Music was awesome"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, but, I'm sorry to say, I probably won't go back.  One test that I have of a place is their burger.  This burger is a double, so my friend and I decided to split it, thinking it would be gigantic.  But, when we got it, the patties were super thin, and it looked like a Big Mac, only not as good (and I don't like Big Macs).  In addition to being thin, it was pretty bland.  My friend got the ribs, and they were ok, but nothing to write home about.  In a bar-b-q restaurant, they need to be excellent.  Mac n cheese and fries were pretty good, but I can get those at a lot of other places that have better entrees to go with them.  Overall pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times now. Gets better and better every time! Love what they have done with the decor of the restaurant. They have a great patio.  Having a giant smoker out there really adds to the fun and keeps Old Town smelling amazing. 
 
The ABT's are a must have. Smoked jalapeños stuffed with cheese and sausage. And to top it all off they wrap them in bacon. How could you go wrong. 

The wings are delicious!  Perfect amount of smoke. They make their ranch and bleu cheese in house and both are great. 

I love what they did with the \"Wachos\". Had them with the tender and delicious pulled pork. 

So far my favorite would have to be the Tri-Tip. Nicely seasoned and smoked to perfection. Ordered the plate with a side of potato salad and Pork belly Mac n' cheese. Definitely recommend getting the Mac n' cheese. 

Desserts were also great. Had the sheet cake and the cobbler. 
 
Great cocktails and draft list. 
 
I really enjoy this spot. Looking forward to coming back and trying some new stuff."}
{"text":"Went with a crowd, the waitress could not handle our group. We had 10 people and restaurant was not crowded. Water took a bit to be refilled and half the table wasn't even acknowledged. Would maybe consider going back at a different time with less people."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice their first week. The menu has evolved a little since I have first came, but the quality and service is always great. Love the atmosphere, the music and I especially love the food. Sometimes as expected everyone orders the same item and you might have to wait, but the flavor sells it all. Yum"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the negative reviews are all about...but I had a far more positive dining experience.  The outdoor patio is terrific. Our server was lovely; the service unobtrusive.  Drinks were large and strong.  The signature steak sandwich was very good, though I was expecting a bit more intensity based on the smoky aroma wafting in and around the place.  The pulled pork seemed a bit dry until you added one of the BBQ sauces handily on the table. And there is a handy-dandy parking lot right behind the place.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here, but never again. The tri-tip was cooked nice but not very flavorful. The chicken was so-so. The sides need some serious re-thinking. We had the grilled veggies (broccoli), and pork belly mac n cheese for sides. The Mac was super runny, and lacked flavor. The pork belly on top of the Mac reminded me of a meat captain crunch. The owner was very nice, and checked on us. My drink came out with two flies in it and the server said that's what happens when you sit outside... Happily brought me a new drink but I didn't appreciate the snarky comment. I'm excited for a new restaurant to take up that prime real estate in S. Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Smelt this place for a mile. Had to stop in had an amazing meal! Went for the signature tri tip sandwich and some abt's! The abt's were spicy but super delicious and the tri tip was to die for!! Loved the friendly staff and the happy hour specials are great!! 2$ domestic's sounds like a deal to me!! Deffinetly will be back :)"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here May29th,2016....can't believe this place is listed as CLOSED.
I wanted to say----try the onion rings, you won't regret it !!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, we just walked out. 10 minutes waiting and you can't even get someone to stop and get drink order. Food might be good service not so much. Plenty to eat nearby."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. The real problem was the service. Like many others have said its extremely slow. Our waiter seemed to be clueless and messed things up all night. What a shame really."}
{"text":"As big fans of Brat Haus, we were extremely disappointed with the experience at Smokehaus. 

We were initially seated at a table but asked to move to another table in order to be closer to a TV with the NBA game on. The gentleman that had seated us acted as though we had inconvenienced him and mumbled to follow him. We asked him to repeat himself and he said \"Get. Your. Menus. And. Follow. Me.\" as if we didn't understand English.

We ordered our food pretty quickly, a decent sampling of the meats on the menu as well as a few appetizers. 

We waited 30 minutes for our appetizers, and we finished eating them before they came back with the side plates for us to use. I will say that we were happy with our apps; the ABT sausage/jalapenos were good, and the corn muffins were good, as well. 

At the 45 minute mark, our server came to apologize for the wait on the food. 

It finally arrived around 50 minutes, lukewarm, and sans one person's order, which hadn't even been made. The meats, which we assumed would be the showcase, were not great. The pulled pork, which has been \"smoked for 18 hours\" certainly wasn't falling apart like you might have expected, nor did it have any kind of discernible flavor. The tri tip was chewy and flavorless. We requested some salt and some BBQ sauce (the meat platters are served naked) to try to help out; they certainly weren't pulling it off on their own.

As for sides, we were equally disappointed. The chips they include with the sandwiches are just Ruffles upended on the plate. The regular cole slaw was completely flavorless. The bleu cheese kale slaw didn't even feel like a slaw, really... just some raw kale with cheese crumbles on top. 

Small details that are taken for granted in most restaurants were overlooked: our waters weren't refilled until I asked, we weren't offered additional drinks when the first round was finished, we were barely checked in on, etc. A manager came by to ask about our food and when we gave them some unfavorable feedback, he downplayed our concerns instead of taking them seriously.

While I understand that they are only on their fifth day of being open, maybe they should have taken a bit more time to figure things out before opening. 

If you want good BBQ in Old Town, you'd be better off at Bootlegger's or Bandera."}
{"text":"I stopped in to grab a quick drink at happy hour. The staff was great, the owner was nearby and checking on patrons; he readily changed tv channels as a game I was interested in was on. The ABTs were really good. I will be back for those very soon. Nice portion, great flavor. Overall they were great. Happy hour prices on beers were very good too, especially considering the area. I'll be back to try other menu items as the aroma coming from the kitchen is amazing."}
{"text":"Good food for a decent price. Seasoned good .. not a long wait. Very pleased. The wings are juicy and flavorful. Theburger was seasoned good and not dry. The tri tip sandwich was filling and cooked to medium perfection. Will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! I recommend it to everyone. First off, you can't beat their happy hour that includes food and drinks. The pulled pork in outstanding and they have delicious bbq sauces. Get the wachos! They are seriously amazing. Oh, and the service is always good too!"}
{"text":"I read about this opening up on az Central a few days ago and if a new Bbq joint opens up even if it's in old town I wanna give it a chance.. Very clean and new in here. Farm style tables with colorful metal chairs. Decent size patio that faces Scottsdale Rd. Since the smokers are outside not pet friendly. I ordered the tri tip sandwich and abt's which is smoked Jalapeño stuffed sausage cheese and bacon. They have quite a few beers on tap besides the standard domestics. Quite a few bourbons and whiskey as well. I ordered my food to go and since they are still working all the kinks in the kitchen I had time to have two beers very slowly. While I was waiting I ended up ordering a few sides. I got pork belly mac and cheese,bbw beans and kale slaw. I also ordered the pecan pie to go. Yes I spent almost fifty bucks after tip but I wanted to get a decent sample of the menu. 

The tri tip meat was good. They hype the Santa Monica style of cooking but not sure I noticed any difference.. Regardless the main item was good and I woukd get it again. I liked the bacon wrapped Jalapeño with a lil smokie inside(ask them what abt stands for) . I expected/wanted it to be more cheesy. I also liked the kale slaw and this is coming from a non kale lover. It had Bleu cheese nuts and some kinda light dressing. I'm glad I tried the pork belly mac and cheese. The combo was good I definitely would have expected/wanted more pork belly. Maybe even cut up smaller and more crispy. The beans were ehh. Not bad not good no true complaints. The pecan pie was g
Tasty more doughy than my style but absolutely shocked at how small it was (that's what she said?). In a nut shell not bad but I still have my fave bbq place in town that I'm willing to wait an hour in line for."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Best new restaurant in Scottsdale, this place is a must. Favorite part - California tri trip!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. I had the Tri Tip sandwich. The meat was really tender. And Spicy BBQ sauce was amazing! Pretty reasonable priced menu and the food comes out pretty quick. Good place to hang out and get some food and drinks with friends before the night out in the town. My favorite part is that they have my favorite IPA on draft \"Grapefruit Sculpin\"."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich and chicken were amazing, their signature dish the trip tip, was dry and lacked flavor. Mac and cheese and grilled veggies sides were disappointing.  The \"grilled veggies\" were 1 piece of grilled broccoli.  The Mac n cheese needed real cheeses, key word cheeses, it tasted bland and fake.  Hot link tasted like something you'd get at home.

I'd go back for the pulled pork, cocktails, bar service, and onion rings."}
{"text":"It is with a very sad heart that I have to give this place two stars. I heard such great things about the food, so my boyfriend and I headed there this weekend. 

It had all the looks of a great place--slightly off the main drag of ole town scottsdale, so we actually got a parking spot right up front. Gorgeous day for sitting on the patio with the small of delicious BBQ in the smoker right behind us. We sat down and had a nice waitress, Brooke, greet us. 

That's about where the pleasantness ends. We ordered our food right away bc we were starving and we knew we wanted the pulled pork sandwiches. As we were sitting on the patio, we realized it was a good day for a beer, so we stopped Brooke and asked for a beer menu. There was quite a selection and Brooke offered to bring us samples of any beers. We asked for two samples and she came back with them. A good fifteen minutes later, she came back to see if we wanted to order a beer. At this point in time we'd changed our mind out of a pitcher and almost out of a beer. She finally took our order around the time the food came. 

Where was the juicy sandwich topped with coleslaw on a toasty but still soft bun that I had heard so much about? I had to stop another server to ask for slaw since mine had about three slivers of cabbage on it. The meat was cold, the bun was soggy. The pickles I can say were delicious. It was as if our server had let the food sit in the window the entire fifteen minutes she ignored us.

We still debated another beer and she stopped by as we were finishing our food to ask us if we wanted another round. I hesitantly asked for \"one second\" before we ordered our next round. Fast forward twenty minutes, an empty beer glass, and an empty water, and we had once again changed our mind. This is a sure way for a company to lose money---first a pitcher of beer and now our second round.

There were at least three occasions our server didn't bother to check on us for over twenty minutes. She chatted with the hostess and didn't bother to look over at us. The really sad part? The restaurant wasn't close to busy. At the end, we were her only table.

I'm just not sure I have it in me to give this place another try. It looks like it has a good happy hour, but with a new restaurant, you can't afford such bad service and inconsistent food."}
