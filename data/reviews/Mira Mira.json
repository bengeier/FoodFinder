{"text":"Maybe I didn't order the right dish. I'm on the fence. I loved everything about this place. The options. The people. The food. No wait... not the food. Unfortunately for $24 I got the veggie burger with salad and chips add on.   The burger was loaded with SO much salt I could have sworn one bite gave me a medical blood pressure issue immediately. It wasn't just a tad bit. It was SO ridiculously salty that I'm convinced it must have been a mistake. It has to be. Couldn't eat the rest. Sadly got it to go so couldn't go back and tell them.   Maybe I will go back and try their falafel instead."}
{"text":"Staying here at the Sheratin Center for the week on biz from San Diego and discovered this venue.  MiraMira, great food, service and friendly people.  Dishes were unique and tasted great!  Great space, people, foid and drink!"}
{"text":"Setting all time records for talent per sq ft in this petite restaurant located within the gorgeous Assembly Chefs Hall. Was very impressed by the quality of food and friendly, professional service. Located steps away from my office, I'm equally as excited to bring clients in for lunch and to stop by for a drink while picking up a couple orders of kimchi chicken to take home for dinner."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to revisit the Chefs Assembly eatery. So far my experience has been good and Mira Mira is no exception.   I had the BBQ Okra plate. It had okra, cauliflower, peppers and red cabbage slaw.  Everything was cooked just right. Veg still had a fresh crunch. Flavour wise the dish swung towards the mild side. I did wish for some stronger flavouring.  All in all a 'pleasant' dish."}
{"text":"My friend suggested Mira Mira for lunch and I'm hooked!   Their kimchi chicken is delicious - it's grilled chicken with kimchi sauce on top. It's very juicy and there's a lot of flavour. It comes with kale salad which is sprinkled with cheese, seeds and chickpea sprouts. I haven't tried other items on their menu yet because I keep ordering this haha.  I'd highly recommend it! :)"}
{"text":"I like the health focus of Mira Mira, the food tasted like a lot of care was put into it and was very fresh. I ordered the kimchi chicken, which comes with grilled chicken loaded with kimchi sauce, and a heap of kale salad.  The chicken was grilled to perfection and super juicy. I wasn't in love with the kimchi sauce on top. Maybe I was missing the typical crunch from kimchi, or maybe a combined bite with the kale was a little unusual for my taste buds. The portion of the kale salad was huge. Its loaded with seeds and chickpea sprouts. I've never had chickpea sprouts and I think this was a good first. It added a little bit of surprise to each bite.   Located in Assembly Chefs Hall with so many different stall options, this place would not be the first one I'd try, but worth checking out some time. The hall has lots of seating and a very lively atmosphere. The space is newly renovated and beautiful. And as a closing remark, the price is a bit ridiculous... after tax, it came out to a little over $20, assembly chefs hall mark-up :s"}
