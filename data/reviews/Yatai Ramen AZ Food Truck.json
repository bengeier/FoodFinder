{"text":"Yatai Ramen came to my work this week, and it was fabulous. Their broth had the perfect balance of being light and rich. The meat and veggies were great. But the real show stopper is the noodles. They make their noodles by hand, and the noodles have a wonderfully chewy texture. I can't wait for Yatai Ramen to come back!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to see ramen in Arizona. However....was pretty disappointed. It was pretty salty and I was not a fan of the egg. It was alright for a food truck though."}
{"text":"They came by my office today.  All I can say is amazing!  Super friendly Japanese owners!  They keep the menu simple, there were 4 things.  I ordered the Japanese Chicken Curry.  I love Japanese curry, but it is in short supply in the valley.  I was not dissapointed.   If you've ordered form a food truck you know that you are often served smaller portions at a very high price.  That is not the case with their food. Generous portions, nothing more than $9.  Amazing service and the food was served very quickly.  The curry was amazing and I eventually found myself trying to lick the container.  I was stuffed, but it was so good I ordered 2 more portions to eat later.    Everyone kept asking what smelled so amazing.  But you better believe no one will be eating my precious Curry!!!"}
{"text":"Tried their Raman in a Japanese festival. It was crowded and the Raman I got had only one piece of pork and no egg. After Ocatumen it was a fail."}
{"text":"Phenomenal ramen...and from a food truck? Seriously some of the best I've had in AZ. Loved the chewyness of their noodles. Tasty broth too!"}
{"text":"I like the concept of food trucks. I had some really good food from food trucks in the past, and it is a great way to get into the food business.  I like ramen and always in search of really good ramen shops in US.  Ramen I had in Arizona are so far just average. Since this is served in food trucks? I had high expectations.  I've been following them on Facebook to see where they might show up, and every time they come to my area, either I was out of town or already had lunch appointment. Finally I had a chance to try today... Every time I missed them, my expectation grew...  Noodle was very nice with good ramen noodle texture. Unfortunately broth was a bit weak for my preference. It could just be my personal preference as I just ate really good ramen in San Francisco a few days ago, and some reviewers said they were salty. Ramen came with boiled egg and it was just hard boiled egg, not soft egg I like for ramen. Perhaps it doesn't do good to serve soft egg from food trucks.  My friend had yakisoba and i got to taste a little from her plate. It tasted like real yakisoba.  The chef was very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"A nice couple runs this truck. From a food truck, the ramen is not bad. It tastes better than something from Ramen Republic any day. The broth is not that rich but it's also not diluted in any way where it taste like water or something. I do wish it was a richer broth but it's sufficient. Noodles are good and you get egg and meat. There's other items on the menu too but I haven't tried them. I just stick to their ramen since I love ramen. :)"}
{"text":"Got the chance to visit this truck again at the Street Eats festival this weekend - and I'm so glad we did! They took care of the long line of hungry patrons much quicker than at some of the other trucks, and we loved the generous portion of edamame we were served. My 5-star rating definitely still stands!"}
{"text":"Ramen at food trucks have been so disappointing for me. Either too expensive for what you get or \"ma ma\" (so-so in Japanese) quality. I ate the ramen of the Arizona Matsuri's other ramen truck last year and was disappointed. Enter Yatai Ramen AZ Food Truck. EXCELLENT!  Quality and quantity were great. $8 per bowl is really reasonable for food truck fare. And you get a big bowl of ramen. It filled me up. There was hard boiled egg, sprouts, kombu, and maybe something else, too, but what really struck me was THE best pork I have ever had in a ramen! It was so tasty, perfectly tender, moist, and flavorful. Some pork slices you get in ramen seem almost dried out.  The broth was really good, not overly salty. Noodles were just right.  This is a wonderful food truck.  5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money. 4* = Outstanding. Top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business. 3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it. 2* = Not so good. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money. 1* = How are they still in business? Stay away at all costs!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best ramen I have ever had in my life!! I would eat this for bfast lunch or dinner!!! Its especially good for a hangover!! Lol!!! It does the body good:)"}
{"text":"I have nothing but high praise for Yatai Ramen. A husband/wife team runs this food truck and they do an amazing job. The wife takes the orders and the husband makes all the food. They are very efficient working in that tiny truck! The few times I've been, I usually wait 15 minutes or so for my food. Which is pretty good, considering how popular this truck appears to be!  My husband and I have tried everything on their limited menu - ramen, yakisoba, curry, and teriyaki chicken. We've even had their fried egg rolls and Judy's famous Hibiscus tea. (The tea is amazing - if it is available, GET IT.)  My favorite dish is their teriyaki chicken bowl. Juicy teriyaki chicken with vegetables over rice. The chicken is sliced a little on the thin side, but super juicy and flavorful. The rice is tender and sticky - in a good way! I always want to order it, but since it is usually \"the special\" they have run out a few times.   My husband loves their chicken curry and I'll admit, it's definitely tasty. The chicken is tender and the curry is delicious. Not too spicy. As for the ramen, both my husband and I have tried it on separate occasions. While it is delicious, it isn't my favorite. The broth is good, but I wish there was a little more meat or something more filling.   Overall, it's a great food truck. If you like Japanese food or want to try something new/different, give them a try. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Tried the Yatai Food Truck for the first time today.  I'd heard about them but was never in the right place at a convenient time to catch them.  Boy am I impressed.  This is the way the broth should taste in a bowl of tonkotsu ramen.  For me, it's the broth that makes or breaks the dish.  This broth has been cooked for 20 hours and you can really tell.  The flavor is rich.  This is the only bowl of ramen I've found in Phoenix that even gets close to true tonkotsu ramen the way it's served in Hakata on Kyushu.  If I had one bit of constructive criticism I would like the broth to be a little bit thicker in terms of the texture, just my personal preference.  As far as I'm concerned this place sets the bar for ramen in Phoenix.  If your establishment can't meet or exceed this level of deliciousness, just give up and stop serving ramen.      Can't wait to get another bowl from Yatai Food Truck!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love following this Ramen cart to the various Japanese festivals they cater. The tonkotsu ramen is to die for. The pickled ginger and other toppings compliment the broth beautifully. It is the most authentic bowl of ramen I have had in AZ. The price is very reasonable as well. The curry is not as satisfying as the ramen, but still worth trying."}
{"text":"Well, I guess it is about time to update this review and add a star because you can tell that these guys have gotten a working system down. They continue to show up somewhat regularly on Thursdays at Hayden Ferry office complex and when they do I always get a bowl of Ramen. Hot and delicious, you can tell they put a lot of care into their product. The wait times are not as bad it used to be. And I appreciate the new bowls so that I don't burn my hands trying to carrying it back to my office."}
{"text":"We ate here at a Japanese Friendship Garden Festival We waited about 45 minutes for our food, but to be honest, the place had a huge line and there were some electrical problems such as some power failures.  When we did get the food, I had the Ramen, which was alright but for the price they listed, didn't really fill me up. The Yakisoba my friend got was pretty bland as well.  I do like the friendliness the place exerts and the kind of rustic, homeliness the truck's theme shows. No fancy truck skins here!  My advice? Go here for the ramen. That's what they're known for anyways."}
{"text":"I attended the Food Truck Festival at Salt River about 2 years ago.  We arrived early enough before the insane long lines.  We were all happy to see this food truck at the festival.  The bowl of ramen was decent. Ingredients were on the smaller portion end tho for the price. Broth was just ok since I'm used to the richer taste.  It wasn't too bad for a food truck."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Yatai for a while but since they're a food truck it was kinda hard to find them trough the week. Finally I found them at the Tempe beach park annual Hawaiian Festival. Ordered a tonkotsu ramen and literally there were like 4 people in front of be before ordering. They had one lady working at the register charging for the transaction, an older gentleman working as a cook , and 2 \"aides\" doing nothing. Waited 25 minutes for my ramen. Broth was bland, ramen noodles undercooked, stiff kinda like a a doughy texture. Chashu pork was nothing spectacular just ordinary pieces of pork, bland and just a couple little pieces. Egg was over cooked. I was so disappointed, I would not recommend this place I ended up throwing away my ramen plate."}
{"text":"Well I wanted to try this food truck because they have Teriyaki Bowls not much of a Ramen or Noodle guy Give me Chicken Veggies and Rice any day! The chicken is great with the perfect balance of veggies and rice. Id recommend the Teriyaki Chicken bowl any day!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best Raman ever. The stock is succulent, tasty, complex and the other stuff that sits in it is perfect. I could eat the pickled ginger all day. The owners are super friendly.  I could eat this healthful goodness every day."}
