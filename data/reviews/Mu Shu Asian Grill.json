{"text":"This place was delicious! Great service and yummy food. We had 2 stir frys and a shrimp mu shu. Family owned business and super clean and cute ladies room. This is a must if you ever in Pheonix!"}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions and this is a solid joint to get some stir fry!  I usually opt for the make-your-own stir fry or the occasional pad thai dish. The sauces they use for their stir fry are delicious and the vegetables they provide are fresh and crisp. The portions are large and it's hard to go wrong.   As for the pad thai they serve here, I have mixed reviews. The first time I ordered it it was bland and didn't satiate my craving for savory pad thai, granted this isn't a Thai place, but still. Then I ordered it again, but this time asked for EXTRA SPICE. It was a success! Much better than the first experience. Still not the best place for a pad thai lover but good if you're in need of a quick fix.   The only negative I have about this place is the service. Every time I came in I was never greeted with friendly smiles, or enthusiastic hellos. I like to be somewhat acknowledged somewhere when I come in often. The waitresses almost make me feel like they want me to leave. Besides that though, good food!"}
{"text":"For years I drove past this place... and a good analogy would be don't judge a book by it's cover, or a restaurant by the bus stop in front of it. When I finally did stop in for dinner I kicked myself for not visiting sooner. The Ong's are amazing people and are always really welcoming and nice. They even ask about my daughter if I don't have her with me... and it's not like I'm in every day. You open the door to a happy cat giving the high five and it only gets better. This place is clean, clean, clean. You could eat off the floor clean. Yes, Asian food can be high in calories, and if you are one of those people that count them, then this is the place for you. They have the freshest vegetables for stir fry (the buffet is always beautiful) and they can stir them up healthy and low cal for you in a jiffy. Or if you are old school you can kick it fried with a sweet and sour sauce. It is the best of both worlds and they have something for everyone, even a kids menu. My daughter loves the honey chicken with white rice. And I swear, the most expensive thing on the menu is the lobster and at $15 dollars... well, need I say more. Most lunch items are $6.95 and they pop it up to $7.95 for dinner. It is almost crowded at lunch and all sorts of smart people can be found eating there. Dinner is a little quieter, but on a third or fourth date this spot can be a great place to eat and converse and it won't dent your wallet. No one rushing you out and it's quiet in a nice way. They also serve beer and wine (happy hour is 4 to 7) and they have a soda fountain so you can help yourself or the server will top you off... especially at dinner when it isn't as crowded. This is really a mom and pop place and they take pride in all they do. If you are looking for hip/franchise (drive) move along. This is a one of a kind place with regulars. My favorite dish is their Mu Shu wrap which includes all the yummy deliciousness of the traditional Chinese dish wrapped in a tasty tortilla. I'm pretty sure this is the only place that has a Chinese/burrito and it is fantastic (I can barely finish half of it.) My only complaint could be that the servings are huge or to put it nicely very, very generous. It is all a part of the awesome hospitality of the place so I don't hold it against them, but you won't be able to leave without a take out bag (because you wouldn't want to hurt Mr. Ong's feelings.) Take out is quick, their food is great for the price, and if you happen to be a bus rider the nearest bus stop is only a few steps away. They have a web site with coupons sometimes, so check them out on-line before you go. So uò dé kuài lè!"}
{"text":"I went around 5:30pm during the week it looked dead but the food was really good. A plate of stir fry was more than enough food for 2 people....even had leftovers! Will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Mu Shu is the go-to place for lunch/dinner take out.    They have a menu, but why would you bother?  The build-your-own stir fry is the way to go.  Take your choice of chicken, shrimp, and whatever else they have... choices of sauce (go for the spicy garlic), and noodles, white or brown rice.  Then grab a bowl and stuff in as many veggies as you can.  The veggie bar is immaculate, and you can tell they use the freshest ingredients: onions, broccoli, bean sprouts, watercress, kale, tofu, green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and probably 5 others I got.  I usually go with chicken, light spicy garlic sauce, and white rice.  It runs me about $7, and I end up saving half of it for a second meal.  The take-out service is super quick, and the staff couldn't be friendly.  It only took two take-outs to become a regular.  Be sure to ask for a stir-fry card (I believe its 11th one free), as you will be using it!"}
{"text":"Mu Shu can be very average or very good depending on what you order. The dishes that we all love like Orange Chicken aren't very good despite using chicken breasts and good ingredients. You can tell that it is quality, but there is no \"pop\" to it. However, the mu shu wrap is outstanding (add a little plumb sauce), and the Mongolian grill is pretty solid but could use more options.   Here is your Mu Shu fortune cookie:  \"Your happiness will depend entirely on what you order.\""}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent people! Loved the mu shu wraps and veggie spring rolls. The food was fresh and the service was extremely efficient. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Just had dinner. Going to the ballgame, streets flooded by downpour. Traffic so bad we pulled over at first restaurant and missed the game. Great place. Very friendly owner and staff. If I lived closer, this would be my place for Asian. Had Pork Egg Fu Young. Fresh, light, tender coat on perfectly cooked vegetables. 3 good sized patties with steamed rice on side. Sticky, and  broke up nicely. Very good. Two spring rolls with sweet/hot mustard. They were fried. Wasn't expecting that. But I liked them for what they were. The Lo mien was very good and lively. Both dishes not greasy. Cold Kirin beer went very well."}
{"text":"Love getting all the veggies I want and having them cooked with noodles.  Very nice people working here.  Good lunch spot compared to Pei Wei..."}
{"text":"Dropped into Mu Shu by chance., Had a great meal with plenty of fresh veggies and great service from owner and his wife."}
{"text":"Shrimp Pad Thai like no other. The General Gau chicken is another good one. Take out time is quick,so we just do take out mostly."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this place for months , good food and good service. And one time I take other customers food by mistake, they even don't let me pay it.Feeling so guilty, so in return five stars for this great place!"}
{"text":"Today, my husband and I had lunch here. We've been here multiple times in the past but today was really disappointing. My husband had the steak mu shu and I had the combo, where you get to pick 3 from what they have. The steak on the mu shu was not good quality and my husband had to spit them out. I didn't like my meal as there were barely any meats . Overall the price is steep for the quality you get."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding customer service is great excellent value. I've been I have been here several times the food is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"I love getting take out from this place. The veggies are fresh and most of the entrees are delicious (some are only \"just\" good).  The owners are very friendly and welcoming.   It's my go-to for chinese food.  The atmosphere is not awesome, and so that's why it's better for take out in my opinion. I recommend the spicy shrimp and broccoli.  The crab puffs are delicious and I get them every time.  The Mu Shu Wraps are a bit salty, but otherwise good."}
{"text":"I love Mu-Shu's stir fry. I get to pick all of the fresh veggies and the meal always feeds me for 2-3 meals. The staff and owner are personable and always friendly. Just a heads up, they are NOT open on Sundays, so I try to plan my cravings accordingly. All of my friends that I have brought here love it."}
{"text":"Pretty clean place very awesome workers and the food was fantastic.  Decent price for the high quality of food and service. Definitely coming back for more at a later date, it's close to my work so even better."}
{"text":"This is my first time here, and I ordered the veggie Mu-Shu wrap and it is amazing! I will defiantly be back!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and the people are super friendly, but the atmosphere looked a little dirty or old or both."}
{"text":"If you care about customers then you listen to what the order is.  3 different occasions and only 3 occasions they absolutely didn't cater to our vegetarian diet --- even though when placing the order they repeated it back perfectly ----   And how lame to have to call back or drive all the way back.  People have health concerns --- bottom line ---  and when you ask for NO SUGAR -- expect it here. And when you ask for NO SALT or Soy sauce in the side, expect it.  Let's face it, you can make anything taste like Sugar and Salt, but that's not health ((( as they bill themselves as )))  Try catering to peoples requests."}
{"text":"I have been coming here 1-2 times per month for the past year now for their stir-fry. They have a big salad bar of veggies and you fill up a big bowl and then they cook it with your choice of meat or tofu, sauce, and rice or noodles. For only about $10 you get a delicious, huge, healthy meal (for me it is enough for two satisfying meals). I don't even bother making stir-fry anymore. It's awesome!"}
{"text":"I love the food it was my first time being there The beef is so good and I would recommend this awesome restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I went to this place because it was closed my hotel in Phoenix downtown and it is 4-star in Yelp.   To my disappointment, there was no meat to pick and very limited vegi for stir fry. so we decided to order the regular dishes.   There were just a couple of tables but the service was very slow. The dishes are very tiny for the price and the tea would cost extra.   Overall, This is NOT an authentic Chinese food restaurant. Might be a place that just caters the lunch for people working in downtown."}
{"text":"Great food and nice people.  Everything was very reasonably priced and the servings were big.  My sister has been telling me about this place for years but I never got around to trying it.  Now I know what I was missing.  We tried the hot and sour soup and it was wonderful.  I always judge Asian restaurants by their hot and sour soup and this was some of the best I have had.  We also tried the stir fry and I was amazed by the number of vegetable choices.  Everything from 2 kinds of cabbage, snow peas, spinach and zucchini.   There was enough in the bowl to split and still take some home.   The server and the owner both made a point of stopping at our table to make sure we were having a good time and that we had everything we needed.  The menu was pretty good and I saw lots of my favorite choices.  I'm going to have to force myself to try other things because the stir fry was so good and there were so many options, I could see just getting that every time.   I can't wait to recommend this place to all my friends who live in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is delcious! The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The place is clean, the location is convenient, reasonable prices... what else could you ask for? Try the vegetable Mu Shu; its the bomb, yo!"}
{"text":"Healthy, delicious, fast, relatively inexpensive.  You can assemble your own stir-fry dish to make sure your favorite veggies are apportioned just right."}
{"text":"This place was amazing ! Anyone in the area should stop by.   We were greeted with a warm hello as soon as we walked in and taken to our table and served right away. The food was delicious and nice and hott . Servings are definitely  large and two people can easily share a plate of a la carte . We had egg drop soup ,spring rolls ,lo mein and orange peel chicken and spicy shrimp and it was all great!"}
{"text":"This family owned restaurant has a very welcoming and happy environment. Their stir fry is always excellent (I prefer the chicken stir fry with spicy garlic noodles) and my mother always loves their spicy beef noodle soup. Their chinese food is very addicting and I'm always tempted to make the drive there just for some wholesome chinese food. Definitely one of my favorite places for Asian cuisine in the central Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Dinner was awesome! The food was great the prices were reasonable. My only complaint is that we ordered 2 of the combos to go and did not receive our soups that were supposed to come with it. The only reason this was a problem was the soup was the only reason I ordered the combo. Other than that everything was great!"}
{"text":"Nice lunch. Got the moo shu wrap and it was way too much food. They make it right out front. I got a lame fortune.... :)"}
{"text":"Never been here before and i don't eat chinese food often, due to it usually being quite greasy and low quality ingredients. I was pleasantly surprised at the freshness of the ingredients here. The flavors in all their sauces was quite robust as well. We tried the lemon chicken, mongolian beef, and shrimp foo young. All were very flavorful and the proteins were cooked perfectly. I also appreciated that they have an open kitchen, which looked very clean, far cry from most chinese joints. Service was prompt and friendly as well."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here tonight - I was in the mood for some basic Chinese take out, this was close to us and reviews looked good.   I ordered the most basic Chinese takeout you can order - sweet and sour chicken, brown rice and an egg roll.   The sweet and sour sauce was good. The chicken was dry yet coated in soggy, mushy breading. The brown rice was dry. The egg roll lacked any sort of crispy crunch. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing for take out? I don't know. I just know I won't give them another try."}
{"text":"The Mu Shu grill is good for what it is - a simple make-your-own stir-fry combo restaurant. Loads of veggie options. I made a bowl with veggies and chicken and got the Chinese spicy sauce. Unfortunately, the sauce was really unremarkable and tasted like some hoisin that I could have bought from Safeway.  However, the bowl was neverending. I ate. And I ate. And I ate some more, with no dent being made in the bowl. So needless to say, you'll definitely get your money's worth. I just have to pick a different sauce the next time around.  Cheap, quick, and easy (I'm talking about the restaurant, people, get your minds out of the gutter)."}
{"text":"I was craving fresh stir fry and happen to find this place. I drive by it every day and never made time to try it till now. I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised. The service is friendly and fast. The place is very clean. The food is healthy and delicious. My food tasted so fresh and so full of flavor it was really delightful. I will be recomeded This place to my friends from now on. - I had the build your own stirfry / with king pow chicken - my husband had a similar dish. We loved it! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Excellent as always! When you see a variety of ethnic backgrounds eating in one place, you know the food has touched the palette of many!  *Tip* Ask for your rice to be put in bowl after it gets strained so the rice don't get soggy."}
{"text":"Super fresh veggies on the \"build your own\" stir fry bar. The final product was also REALLY good. I got the spicy garlic sauce with rice noodles and chicken. The portion was HUGE once it was all prepared.   We came on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. The owner chatted us up and seemed like a really nice guy... Answered all our questions.   My wife got the Mu Shu Wrap and it was really big and super tasty. (She let me have a bite.) We also shared some wonton soup that was made on the spot   with fresh stock and spinach off the stir fry bar. It was great!  Overall I really enjoyed this place. It's not upscale but it is a really fresh tasty alternative to traditional Chinese or greasy fast food.   The owner says they get a big lunch rush during the week but they have plenty of seating and I think they'd be able to accommodate groups. I had a really good experience! Totally worth a visit to try!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here when they first opened  and the concept was a little strange at first I hadn't eaten here honestly in a few years. My bad. I hit it up recently and it was absolutely delicious. Everyone needs to try this place. I forgot to take pictures of my food because I ate it all before I thought about it but because you can make your dish however you want it becomes perfection and mine was. Try it if you don't like it- it's on me. But you have to find me first. LOL"}
{"text":"I tried the beef stir fry with spicy garlic sauce, no rice, no noodles. I could eat this everyday! So fresh and full of flavor. The veggie choice are typical of asian cuisine and I love how I can choose what veggies and how much. Great choice for my Paleo-diet!"}
{"text":"Well, I really wanted to like this place due to how close it is to our new home. However, we must have ordered the wrong items. First off, the staff is VERY friendly and made an effort to be courteous and attentive throughout the meal. Also the spring rolls were pretty darn good. Unfortunately for us, what came next tells a different story.   The almond chicken was very non-tradition being that it contained different veggies than usual and had shaved almonds sprinkled on top instead of cooked within the dish. The chicken spread throughout the dish is comprised of all dark meat fatty pieces. The pork low mein had rubbery strips of pork; looked and tasted oily. In fact everything we ate seemed to just slide down your throat because it was VERY greasy.   Again, maybe we ordered the wrong items. However, I don't know if we will ever know because most likely we will be headed back to China Chili."}
{"text":"First time dinning here, order the veggie stir fry with noodles and my father order the beef stir fry with rice. Great vegetable selection, and food was made fast enough to get you in an out for lunch."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for great Asian food. Its priced reasonably. The quality is excellent. Top marks for the Teriyaki  chicken and the fried rice. The Teriyaki chicken is not the usual sweet stuff. Its a hearty almost beef broth like flavor. I'm a huge fan of the friend rice as well. I've had numerous beef dishes. The meat is always super tender. The staff is super nice, very attentive, always quick to take your order or get a drink. Its never busy for dinner either. With a restaurant.com certificate it makes the deal even better."}
{"text":"Hands down the best/healthiest Chinese food in all of Arizona and trust me I've tried them all! I highly recommend the house fried rice with their hot mustard (yum yum it's the best mustard)!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in last night at 8:45pm when they close at 9pm.  We asked if it was still alright to get an order to-go.  They were supper welcoming and didn't rush us at all.  All the vegetables for us to build our dish we beautiful and fresh.  While we waited for the food to cook, I got to watch them all work to close-up.  Each person paid attention to the details and they didn't take any short cuts.  This place was spotless clean. Finally, the food was amazing!  I got the veg stir-fry with Kung pao and noodles. My man had beef and pork with spicy garlic and fried rice.  Plenty left-overs.  Look forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"Great spot! Love the \"Stir-Fry Your Way\". Their veggie bar is great, the veggies are varied and fresh, and you get a lot of food for the price!"}
{"text":"great place to eat healthy Asian good. Not greasy or processed. I've have the noodle bowl with tons of veggies and the mu shu burrito with chicken. One of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"My very favorite lunch spot. I have been here many times over the years - but now I go a few times a week for lunch. Everyone at my work is addicted as well. Great owners and staff."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for lunch, however it can be crowded and hard to move around in.   The stir fry bowl was very fresh, the one thing I noticed was that they probably don't clean their stir fry grill that often between bowls as some of my beef tasted like fish (not good for those with food allergies), but I would assume you could ask them to clean it first.  Could have been a bit more beef in the bowl for the price.  Not sure if I'd go again."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years. Its my favorite place for Asian food!  Its locally owned so that's important to me to support our local businesses.  Its family owned and they are always so nice and friendly and even advised me to eat the hot and sour soup while i was sick cause it would make me sweat ."}
{"text":"I decided to break a three day fast here, and  I was really hungry. I would have eaten just about anything.   I ordered the calamari appetizer and Shrimp lo mein. The calamari was served black and burned, furthermore I'm 99.8% sure it was imitation calamari. The shrimp lo mein was really nothing special. P.F. Chang's frozen dinners are better.   The bill for the burned calamari and and bad lo mein was twenty dollars. It's a shame because it's close to work, but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Their stirfry is so fresh and I love how healthy it is with all the vegetables. The owners are so sweet and always chat with me when I go in."}
{"text":"This place is great. You pick the protein and any amount of fresh veggies you want so they can stir fry it together. Its healthy and taste great. They also have a Burrito like meal which they call MuShu which is AWESOME!!.. You can't go wrong, and be for the look out for the older asian lady, she is nice, so you should tip her =D"}
{"text":"Have never actually sat down to eat here as I've only done takeout, but the food is always really good...we have tried a little bit of everything and never been disappointed. The owner and family are there and always very nice and helpful. It won't be the cheapest meal on the planet but Chinese food never is, but it will be worth it...which I don't say often lol."}
{"text":"Great experience! Fresh veggies stir fried for you. Nice selection of sauces. Prices are really good. Staff is really friendly. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing , nice and fresh veggies. The people are great!! I recommend the bowl."}
{"text":"Custom stir fry is amazing. Healthy and reasonably priced. Owners are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!  The owner is super friendly too which is a plus.  Just go!"}
{"text":"Quick service, you cant get anymore made to order than here!  Love this place, it also has an element of fun to the whole pick your own veggies and the amounts of each.  Then watch them cook it right in front of you in the open kitchen.  Very very tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"This is definitely our go-to spot for Chinese. I used to be more adventurous but I have found my favorites and they are great every time!! I appreciate that consistency. I do the \"Make your own\" Stir-Fry and the Moo goo gai pan. My hubby gets the combo plates and loves the Mongolian Beef and Lemon chicken (with their awesome Hot and Sour soup!!) We also do the Pu-Pu platter! My only qualm is that the mushrooms I would like to use in my stir-fry aren't always as clean as they should be. /:"}
{"text":"I build my own stir-fry and I had the veggies with noodles.  The service is quick and the staff are very friendly. I had left overs and I had it to go. Make sure to ask for a bag to place your to-go box, because the sauce from your food will leak and you don't want to wear it on your shirt or spill all over your car.   Nice place to eat Chinese food!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and I was hesitant but my co workers convinced me that it was a good place to try for lunch. Good thing that they did because I loved it. For my first time it is something that I will continue to be coming back for."}
{"text":"Tried their m u shu pork wrap with fried rice on the side . It was too large to eat in one sitting  . The fried rice was bland and not sure it goes along with the dish . There are a lot of vegetables  a little  on the salty side . I asked for less salt and oil. The staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Good stuff! I got the veggie lettuce wraps and the veggie mu shu wrap. The mu shu wrap looks just like a chipotle burrito but it's filled with a Chinese stir fry... Yumm!"}
{"text":"The owner Gary is very friendly,  I like the  grilled vegetables,  one bowl, but  you can fill to the top, I like this with spicy  garlic  sauce with shrimp,  enough  for a meal and a half ,, let them know if you like your vegetables  soft or firm , reasonably  priced"}
{"text":"The sizing rice soup was soo good, not at all greasy or salty, very healthy. The broth was good. The egg drop soup was ok."}
{"text":"A good Mongolian BBQ choice to load up for lunch.  The spicy was not very hot so I'll head back to try more spicy selection.  Good food that is close to downtown."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, along with the service! I'll be coming back for sure!  I ordered a combo with Lemon Chicken & Kung Pao chicken. The combo also came with soup to start & a spring roll on the side.  I couldn't eat it all and for $10, I got 2 meals out of it! My boyfriend ordered the stir fry with chicken.  We both agree this place has fresh, tasty food!"}
{"text":"To us this is one of those gem's you hear about. We have gone to Mu Shu many times for lunch and never had a bad experience.  We usually get the the stir fry its a great deal and always have leftovers. This trip we were with a friend and ordered off the reg menu. Once again they did a great job.  The place is always clean and staff friendly."}
{"text":"Great mu shu. My husband had their make your own stir fry--huge servings and fresh ingredients. We shared wonton soup with fresh spinach. My mu shu was sized like a big burrito, fresh and moist and tasty."}
{"text":"The food and service are outstanding. We have been coming here for a while, hopefully a lot more people will start coming here.  The stir fry dish is A-Mazing."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever and I am just now trying it. We stopped in for lunch and were greeted by a friendly host who was happy to explain how to create your own stir fry bowl. My coworker ordered off the menu but I did the make your own bowl and was able to choose between various proteins, rice or noodles and an assortment of vegetables and sauces. I loved being able to load my bowl up with squash instead of the usual peppers and onions. The bowl was huge. In fact I ended up eating the leftovers for dinner that night. While waiting for your meal you can also grab a bowl of wonton chips and sweet and sour sauce to snack on. I could honestly just eat those the are so yummy.  The restaurant is clean and the service is friendly and efficient. It's a great quick lunch option."}
{"text":"This is very simple, very healthy and very good! You walk in, place your order, pay and find a seat. If you choose the Asian grill you take a very large bowl and fill it with a wide variety of biased sliced, fresh veggies. I added baby bok choi to my mix. Then you request beef or chicken and order your drink and seat yourself. You also must order rice or what kind of noodles- flour or rice and which sauce. I chose rice noodles, chicken and teriyaki. There is self serve drinks, chili sauce(s), fried wonton and sweet and sour sauce. They call your name and you are ready to eat in the same bowl you used to select your veggies. I like to eat Asian food with chop sticks. I also dip the wanton in the sweet and sour- very good! The food is cooked perfectly, neither under nor overcooked. Kinda of a small meat portion but that's fine with me. The chicken was cooked perfect, the beef thin sliced and tender as it should be. I would have liked a shrimp choice but that's not the case. You can also order egg rolls and other standard side dishes. All-in-all the food was good, the bowl holds so much you need to take some home. I highly recommend Mu Shu, it is nice, clean, the Asian staff is friendly and there was a beautiful water color painting on the wall."}
{"text":"Went to Mu Shu today at noon with my wife for first time.  We were both very impressed with the food, the service, and the friendliness of the personnel.   Mu Shu kind of reminds me of a cross between a mongolian grill and a restaurant.  The stir fry which we both had was very, very good.  Large portions and lots of veggies. We'll go back."}
{"text":"If Asians eat at an Asian restaurant, it has to be good, and I have often seen Asians eating here. Lovely architecture and decor, great pick-your-own stir fry, and plentiful classic dishes to order off the menu. Not crazy about their soups, but their entrées are tasty."}
{"text":"Went there service was bad and the food was bland and unsatisfying. The decor is horrible and confusing."}
{"text":"It's fine. I think Ghengis Grill has a better variety and better flavors."}
{"text":"Got the shrimp stir fry.  Overall quantity of food is good but as to the protein...Only 5 pieces of shrimp for almost $12!!  Also, take out box is not leak proof. In fact when I got back to the office, there was a lot of sauce outside the container.  At least the plastic bag did not leak or else my car would smell like soy sauce forever...."}
{"text":"This place is \"da bomb!\"  Been going there for about 10 years off and on, very close to Central Phoenix, easy access from westbound Thomas, just turn right into the parking lot (which can be crowded at lunchtime).  They are open daily 11a - 9p (EXCEPT SUNDAYS).  If you avoid lunchtime, you can get the shortest lines.  You can go very healthy with the self-serve stir fry by choosing lots of darker veggies, going with chicken, asking for half the amount of sauce and choosing brown rice instead of white rice.  I also avoid soy products and cabbage (thyroid issues), so I avoid the cabbage and the tofu that are available in the self-serve veggie buffet, but I get everything else and there are a lot of other choices of veggies (huge fresh spinach leaves, bean sprouts, green peppers, celery, mushrooms, cut zuccini, tomatoes, onions, pea pods, bok choy, etc., etc.).  It's a comfy little place to \"eat in,\" but personally I like to hit the self-serve buffet and split.    It's very convenient to the Central Avenue Business Corridor and is frequented by people who work near there during lunch, so try to go some other time like before or after the lunch hour to get in and out quicker.  The kung-pao sauce is very, very hot, so next time I think I'll ask for \"half Teriyaki sauce and half Kung Pao sauce,\" then ask for half as much total sauce as they usually provide -- otherwise the rice gets too soaked and the box leaks.  I also ask for the veggies to be stir fried lightly so they're crunchy (al dente) (why fry all the nutrients out of the veggies?).  I think next time I'll ask for aluminum foil to line the styrofoam takeout box so the sauce doesn't leak in my car and the hot food doesn't melt the styrofoam (a xenoestrogen), or if I think of it in advance I'll bring a sheet of aluminum foil with me.  Perhaps someday they'll change to a more environmentally friendly and healthier alternative to-go box made out of a paper product or something, instead of the current styrofoam box.  Very friendly service, especially the manager dude -- I can't believe he recognized me after like 4 years!  The place is SUPER CLEAN, but the restrooms are teeny tiny.  I fill my self-serve stir fry bowl to a mound of overflowing veggies and since they are fried only lightly (per my request), they don't melt down to a small volume, so there are leftovers for the next day.  My ONLY possible suggestion for them would be if they started serving MONSTER SIZED EGGROLLS.    Very casual dining/take-out, no need to dress up.  If you DO dine in, they have FREE REFILLS of sodas and iced tea at the fountain.  Do not pass \"Go,\" do not collect $200, do NOT miss Mu Shu!!!  These folks thought of self-serve stir fry YEARS BEFORE Mongolian BBQ came along..."}
{"text":"If you like spicy Asian food, do NOT come here. It's very bland and flavorless. Even adding a ton of soy sauce and chili oil didn't help. If you don't like much spice or flavor, this is the place for you. It's too bad, the service is great and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is incredible if you're looking for good mu shu. They actually use the authentic thin wrappers that are typically used for this dish instead of tortillas by most places around here.  It wasn't overly saucy like many  Chinese restaurants often tend to be nowadays. And did I mention their mu shu wrap is ginormous! This place is defintely in an unsuspecting location, but I'll defintely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Love this place and the service. Also conveniently located by PC so post workout dinner is always a plus. Healthy and fresh food!"}
{"text":"One minute from my house.  Mama memories and flashes of my past life as a restaurant child come flooding when I see the hardworking family crew at Mu Shu holding it down. The personal touches and friendliness go so far. It makes me want to support this little sparkly jewel in my sector.  The stir fry is where it's at. Also, the beef on a stick served at the table with a tiny, fiery griller was the unequivocal favorite of my party. Char! Char! Char!  Great price point, fresh and healthy selections (if that's what you're after) and lovely service.  Mama is the glue."}
{"text":"I'm back! is what I proclaimed as I walked through the door. However the longer line just gave me an odd look.  This trip I decided to take my entire team, which ranged from Chinese food pros, to a recent grad from Montana who had to ask me what half of the veggies were.  Overall we had a good trip, our food was good, the service was pleasant and overall it was a good value. Because it was a busy Friday it did take longer for our food to cook than expected. Also we got the last parking spot in the lot, if we were a few minutes later I don't know what we would have done.  I opted for the make you own stir fry with kungpow sauce. I recommend when filling your bowl you skip the broccoli until later as it just takes up excess space at the bottom. I went heavy on the tofu and pea pods this time. The food came nuclear hot so it did take some time for it to cool down enough to eat.  My coworkers were surprised by the volume of food and they seemed to enjoy their shezuan beef and chicken dishes.   I am not the food authority at the office, if some one is going out they now ask me where to go thanks to my recommendation of this place for lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to My Shu for dinner tonight. I can sum up the food in just one word \"YUM\"! Everything was so good, the veggies were so fresh, spring rolls to die for. I had the Veggie My Shu with fried rice. It was huge and absolutely the best Mu Shu ever. My husband had Sweet and Sour chicken and he loved it. He can be a bit picky about Asian food and this place was a hit. The service was wonderful, everyone was very friendly. I loved the open kitchen concept. I could see right into the kitchen and it was super clean. 5 Stars!!"}
{"text":"Extremely satisfied with this restaurant!!  As soon as we walked in the door we had prompt and courteous service. The waitress was so upbeat and available when needed! Our appetizers and food came really quick and hot!! The waitress routinely checked on us. The manager or owner was great also! He came to everyone's table and asked How our food and service was and chit chatted also! The food portions were large and tasted amazing! The price was perfect for the amount of food and great service we received.  For two dinner plates 1 appetizer a glass of wine and a soda it was 42.00."}
{"text":"Wow. We really like this place a lot, especially the stir fry!  My wife gets nothing else. I have had about half of the items on the menu and have enjoyed each. My new favorite is the honey chicken. The house fried rice is full of veggies and meat, it's a meal in itself. The owners/staff are so sweet and friendly to boot and always make us feel welcomed, especially our 2 year old daughter. The husband/owner always makes a point of offering her a fortune cookie right away and she loves the attention. I kind of don't want to write how much we like this place for fear others will start going and we will not be able to get in, so don't go! ."}
{"text":"This place is easy and convenient, but a little over priced.  I love that you can pick your veggies and get as much as you want, but once they're doused in sauce, you can't even tell which veggies are which.  I will be going back because I do love the veggie selection, but I won't  EVER pay the extra $1 for fried or brown rice.  You can't even tell the difference between the white, brown or fried.  The next time I go, I plan on asking about limited sauce.  We shall see!"}
{"text":"Our go to place for fresh, fast, reasonable, healthy food! We love everything here. However if you are a Egg Foo Young fan their's is truly the best in the valley. The chicken egg rolls are fantastic. All the soups and the clay pots are amazing. Filling your bowl with all the vegetables you want, then picking your protein and then your sauce is my fav...."}
{"text":"Meh. Not impressed. The food was below average and the people who work there were unfriendly."}
{"text":"After reading all the hype I decided to check this place out.  I checked out their online menu and the lobster in black bean garlic sauce caught my eye so I headed out the door with my wife and son and went for dinner.  I did not order the stir fry.  I arrived at the location and was greeted by an older asian woman who sat us and got our beverages.  I ordered shrimp fried rice, lobster in black bean garlic sauce, pot stickers and my wife ordered the peking beef.  The food arrived and as soon as I saw the lobster I knew we had a problem.  The plate itself looked messy and unappealing.  The lobster was way overcooked and hard, I did not consume half of the dish.  The taste was very lacking and the sauce was very bland.  The shrimp fry rice was basic with peas and carrots in the dish.  The pot stickers were delicious.  The peking beef was okay.  Needless to say I will not be returning to this place and would not recommend it to anyone else. I did communicate my dislike to someone who looked like the owner or manager."}
{"text":"Stir Fry Done Right   At Mu Shu Asian Stir Fry you create your own stir-fry, and this is stir fry at its finest. First you choose from two types of rice or noodles,  mix in your choice of four diffrent sauces, select a protein (chicken, beef, pork, shrimp veggies). Then get ready to add some side dishes to compliment your entrée, such as spring rolls or pot stickers.  If you want to try something diffrent but absolutely delicious, order a Mu Shu Wrap. It's  a huge tortilla filled with your choice of protien,  fresh onions, carrots, scallions, cabbage, bamboo shoots and mu shu sauce, all stir fried in a sizzling hot wok. On today's visit, I had the Steak Mu Shu Wrap and it was delicious.   At Mu Shu Asian Grill you are served such a generous helping you will be able to eat this meal twice. The entrées are affordable, customer service is outstanding, and the food is delicious.  If your ever in the area give Mu Shu Asian Grill a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a great meal and the service here is fantastic! Book marked this place for future dinners!  I tried a chicken bowl with veggies and rice. They offer very large servings my fiancé had the combo meal and it was huge!"}
{"text":"Great owner. Great food. Great service. Wonderful stir fry. Menu prices well and combinations are excellent."}
{"text":"We came here because they offered low carbs and my friend is on the Keto diet. While nothing seemed to particularly point to low carbs on their menu, the visit was incredibly memorable for a few reasons: Upon walking in we were surprised to find a full stir fry vegetable selection aisle as well as a well lit open table setting. The place was very very clean and really inviting, and we could see a huge line was already building at the register. We didn't know what we were getting and I didn't see a menu in sight unfortunately, but luckily the owner spotted us on our phones and quickly offered menus. The owner was incredibly kind and social, making conversation with each person that came. I ordered the mu shu wrap w/chicken brown rice and medium spice, while my friend ordered the stir fry with the spicy sauce. We were particularly hungry at this point so we threw in the beef on a stick appetizer. Really good pricing ($8) The beef on a stick was ready for us very quickly, maybe after 5 min, and came with a portable oven for us to roast the beef to our liking. We were really into the interactive part of this dish and it honestly made the experience 10x better. It was without a doubt delicious, highly recommend this appetizer. I should note that this whole time while we were eating, the waitress came by multiple times asking if we needed anything, and even brought to go boxes without asking us when we clearly needed them. really sweet person! I have never had mu shu before, but I've heard of it many times, which is pretty much why I ordered it. The mu shu wrap looked basically like a burrito, Asian style, and came with a side of a sweeter sauce. I subbed in the spicy garlic sauce they had near the drinks instead, and all in all, it was one of the best \"burritos\" I've had. cannot stress how absolutely delicious this wrap was! I think the spicy sauce really helped, but still great on its own. At the end, we thanked the same owner who took our order on our way out, and he asked us how we found out about the place. We told him Yelp and he mentioned that they don't advertise at all so that was really cool that we found out about their place. Because of that I thought I owed him a review (my first one), and because the place definitely deserved it.  5 stars easy, will be coming again!"}
{"text":"We finally got a chance to stop in Mu shu Asian Grill last night. The first thing we noticed was how clean the restaurant looked. We were seated immediately and asked what we would like to drink. The menu is filled with the items you would expect in a Chinese restaurant but also features a stir fry menu. Pick you protein, chicken, steak or shrimp then go up to the bar in front of the opened kitchen to select your fresh vegetables. Choices of rice or noodles are also included. We started with the egg drop soup that was very good and after a few minutes our meal arrived. A huge bowl filled with all of the pre-chosen veg, meat and rice. I choose the classic Chinese sauce and it was delicious. Our server was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Mongolian BBQ...On the NW corner of Thomas & 15th AvenueLove this place!  ...If you go here, get the Stir Fry in the front!...I love to add my own ingredients into my bowl which they take from you & stir it all up with the sauce of your choice. Very hearty, lots of food. Always hot & fresh! Very friendly!"}
{"text":"The food was very delicious! And the customer service was even greater than five stars!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this this family owned spot.  They are always super friendly and will recognize you as a \"regular\" by your second visit.  The food is fresh tasting and everything I've had on their rather extensive menu is great.  They have the big grill, so you can either \"create your own bowl\" of goodness, piled high with a huge variety of fresh veggies and your choice of protein / sauces, or you can pick one of their menu favorites.  The space is fairly well lit for this type of establishment and is always clean and tidy.  The decor is sparten but the food is good enough to rise above the atmosphere.  Or have them pack all of your goodness up and take your food on the road.  Either way you will have a great meal for a decent price and still have enough left for another meal.  Mu Shu is everything a family owned restaurant should be topped off with a fortune cookie. :)"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese food and we found this little gem. The food was fresh and delicious. Better than expected.  We had the pupu platter, house fried rice and chicken lo mein. A must try!"}
{"text":"Have been to Mu Shu many times and have never left disappointed. Must admit I get the same thing every time but have yet to taste any difference from the first day I tried it. All guess that I have been here with have been very complimentary about the food and service. A bit pricy but everything is cooked fresh and in your view."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't think I've ever ordered off the menu at Mu Shu Asian Grill, other than to get some pot stickers or something. We always get the choose-your-own stirfry and I've never been let down.   That said, the service is what really shines at Mu Shu. Everyone is attentive and friendly. Their pride in the restaurant shows and makes your dining experience that much better.   Go to Mu Shu Asian Grill -- both for the food and the service."}
{"text":"I was struck by a very intense Chinese food craving on Friday night and this was the closest place with the best reviews. I'm so glad we chose it!  We ordered take out since my husband and I were feeling somewhat under the weather, so I can't remark on the service; except that the very nice gentleman who handled the transaction (he seemed like the owner, but I'm not really sure) was awesome. He gave us a free 2012 calender! And I really liked his vest.  And, the food. We ordered staple basics...chicken lo mein, house special fried rice, teriyaki chicken, and some dumplings. They were all fantastic! The sauce for the dumplings was crazy spicy, though. The food was all a very acceptable level of American-style-Chinese-food greasy, not so much to give me a tummy ache, but juuust enough to make it tastier (in other words, not as good as China Grill in terms of no grease, but wayyy better than Chen & Wok, everything there gave me a bit of a tummyache). Everything seemed really fresh and we both thought everything was crazy delicious! And, $30 (no tip since it was take out) for all of that, and I still have some leftovers. Fantastic! I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix for a conference & headed to another restaurant. When we passed the Mu Shu Asian Grill, the sign caught our attention and we decided to eat here. Are we ever glad we did!! The restaurant is clean; staff is friendly. Service was good but the food is amazing!! There is a bar with veggies you can choose from for a stir fry, to which you can add meat or shrimp if you choose to, and different sauces you can choose from, and the veggies are crisp & fresh. We ordered several items from the menu and each was delectable and tasty. Prices were very affordable, too! It was so good that we came back again the next night and brought others from the conference. We will definitely come again next time we're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Mu Shu is a great place for a fast pace lunch, and low key quiet dinner.   The food is fresh, service is fast and friendly, and the restaurant is extremely clean.  I got the Stir Fry and it was a bowl of hot fresh veggies and your choice of meat. Its a great place to eat healthy food, but be careful you don't over eat cause the portions of food is incredible.  I heard the Mu Shu Wraps are awesome, and I'm gonna try it next time. Also, if you like spicy chinese food, you can always request for them to add spice to anything!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and I actually really like the House special chicken. It is very gingery and green onions. It is lightly battered and fried and just soaked in a light brown sauce. I absolutely love it. This place can get packed and the wait can be a little long sometimes.  You can always call ahead and place your order for pickup."}
{"text":"This was my husband and my first visit. We stopped in for lunch. We were greeted by a gentleman who inquired if this was our first visit. We replied it was, so he walked us through how to order on an order sheet using the menu he gave us to look at.  It is akin to a Mongolian barbecue. We picked our protein, sauce-mild or spicy and then in a bowl we selected our veggies. Once that was completed, in the grill area they have your protein waiting to go with either rice or noodles. They offer steamed white rice or fried rice. If you select noodles it's $2.00 extra and beef is $1.00 more than the pork or chicken. We ordered hot tea and ice water. Our waitress brought our beverages and won ton chips with sweet and sour to our table. She checked with us frequently making sure everything was good and refilled our water and brought more won ton chips. She asked if we would like a container to take home what we could not eat and she brought a plastic bag to carry it out in.  Lastly, she brought out the fortune cookies. I really appreciated her and the excellent service she provided. The restaurant is clean and organized, it runs efficiently and has wonderful and caring staff. The food was fresh and delicious. The beef melted in my mouth, mmmm! We will be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Vegetable Egg Foo Young DELICIOUS! Will be taking my hubby here, for sure."}
{"text":"I've liked everything I've had here and you get a good amount of food. Love the make-your-own bowls with rice noodles, and egg rolls. Had a few different entrees but you really can't go wrong with the make-your-own. Added bonus are the free bowls of fried wonton crisps with sweet and sour and mustard sauces. Only down part is you could spend $15 or more for lunch (if you upgrade to rice noodles and add an egg roll)"}
{"text":"Good, not great, but I can feed myself for two days with one stir fry.. can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great for take out or stay there. Fill a bowl with the vegetables of your choice, then they add meat and sauce of your choice and then noodles, or different types of rice...brown, white, fried.. it's delicious, fast, healthy, and the people are very nice! They also have many other dishes. Yummmmmm!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times just for the stir fry. You pick the meat, sauce and rice or noodles. What I love is that you can put whatever vegetables you want in your dish. Its buffet style when it comes to this, you just grab a bowl, fill it up with whatever fresh vegetables you want and hand it over. They take it and throw it in a Wok with the other choices you've made. For me, its usually hit or miss. When I go close together, I remember what tasted great or egh the time before.   This time I chose shrimp as my meat. I got 5 shrimp in my bowl :( I won't be getting that next time. I also chose the spicy garlic sauce which wasn't that spicy to me. The dish was huge and could easily serve two.  The spring rolls are good, the crab angels are okay, they have this taste that just doesn't taste right to me.  All in all, its just okay. I'm sure there are better places for this type of food, I just haven't found it yet."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood restaurant for me, and I love it!  The food is always fresh!  Being a person who tends to be more of a low carb style, I LOVE the \"build your own stir-fry bowl!!! It was nice to stop by, or call on my way home and have a fabulous dinner available!  The staff is very nice and the establishment is always clean..."}
{"text":"Great food, affordable prices.  Just don't ask for the won ton chips if you're getting your food to go.  Unless you really want someone to tell you off.  Or if I'm there to watch.  It's pretty funny."}
{"text":"LOVE the beef lo mein. This restaurant is very clean but it can get hot inside so I wouldn't sit down with the family and eat here."}
{"text":"Ok I pass by this place all the time and have wanted to try it out.     So finally I did.   The outside of the restaurant looks like it will be a fine dining establishment.  The inside ambiance feels more like a middle of the road buffet.  Cafeterias like chairs, no salt, pepper or sugar on the tables.         I ordered the happy family seafood dinner and egg drop soup.  It came fairly fast.  The soup while good, needed salt...but no salt on the table.   The happy family seafood meal was tasty and had large scallops, medium shrimp and Krab (imitation crab meat). It would have been better without the Krab meat.  It was hot, plenary was there, however the rice portion should have been a larger portion, as it was there was only enough for half the meal.   I ordered iced tea, they asked plain or sweet, since I could see there wasn't any sugar on the table I ordered it sweet.   It was ghastly, some fruity semi sweet slightly sour tea.   I would have appreciated it better if they had told me it was going to be flavored tea.  Personally I think it may have been sitting there all day because of the sour flavor.   The price for this meal, too high in my opinion.  With tip it was about $24.    For that much I would at least expect fresh tea and salt sugar and pepper on the table.  Go figure.     Would I go again?... perhaps.  I'd like to try their Pho. And maybe 1 other dish to give them a second try.   The people were friendly and somewhat attentive."}
{"text":"We loved Mu Shu! I got the stir fry with tofu. You get an enormous bowl to fill with vegetables and pick your sauce and rice/noodles. There was an ample selection of veggies and they all appeared fresh. Our stir fries were ready in just a couple minutes. Overall the portions are very generous. The tofu was the silken kind. The best part about our meal was the service! All of the people working there were incredibly nice and friendly and made us feel so welcome. They explained to us what to do and made sure we got exactly what we wanted. Their smiling faces and kindness made our night!"}
{"text":"Best pot stickers EVER! I have vowed that for any pot sticker cravings I will have, THIS IS where I will go to satisfy my cravings!"}
{"text":"Last Friday was my first time in. Amazed by all the pictures on Yelp I figured I needed to stop by and give this place a try. I am glad I did. Besides the variety of tasty options on the menu, they do build your own stir fry bowls. That is the option I went with. I loaded my bowl with a variety of veggies (bell pepper, red peppers, bean sprouts, spinach, onions, carrots, tomatoes) and paid $2.00 extra for noodles. The sauce I chose was a spicy ginger sauce and meat choice was chicken. My food was cooked fresh to order and came out piping hot. My friends meals were off the menu. I stabbed my fork in theirs which was good but not as good as mine.  Easy process at this restaurant. You walk in and pay for the items you choose. Then you sit down and they call your name. There is a server to check in on you once your seated.   I will be back this place is great."}
{"text":"The food is good. The issue I have with this place is that my wife have gone here once before and we did the create your own. They charge the same ($8.95) no matter if you get just veggies, chicken, or shrimp. That's ridiculous! Both of us got the veggie thing and with a drink we spent almost $30. The veggie option should be two to three dollars less than if you added meat."}
{"text":"Being the first time here I didn't know what expect. I walked in an no one was at the register. All the workers were sitting , having lunch and talking about who would be the one getting up. I waited for a minute and a cashier handed me a paper menu. Since it was my first time here I wanted to take my time and look through the photos in yelp. I ordered honey dipped chicken, I don't recommend, in the picture on yelp looks red but is light brown and very sweet plus the honey makes it too slimmy. The rice was hard and dry , I don't know why this place has sick good reviews"}
{"text":"The prices are a little higher than normal but the food is of a higher quality. I love this place. They have this white sauce that will make you question way have you been putting soy sauce on food ever. They have a great staff and a very short wait time. If you in town take some time and stop by. They have a healthier spin on take out so its good food which doesn't leave you feeling bloated afterwards."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. This place is amazing! I literally am sitting here with a belly full of delicious Hot and sour soup, crab puffs, orange peel chicken, and Peking beef! This is probably some of the best Kari Out I've ever had. The meat is quality, the vegetables are fresh, and for the amount of food they give you, you can't beat the price! I'll be having the rest for breakfast tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, got a bowl with chicken, fried rice and spicy garlic sauce.  They put too much sauce so my rice got soggy.  Also they don't put that much chicken. Very friendly and attentive, but nothing too special.  If you're looking for a quick lunch at a clean restaurant, give it a try."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that for the past 2 years I have lived in Boston, which has some decent Chinese restaurants, great food, but rude/curt/abrupt service. I had learned to keep my head down, not make eye contact and not ask any questions. Eat as fast as possible and get the hell out before someone starts yelling at you!  So understandably my guard was up when I entered Mu Shu Asian Grill. However, complete opposite here. Mr Mu Shu welcomed me to his establishment, asked me if I had ever been here before and took the time to explain the stir fry/salad bar station.  I was in the mood for Mu Shu, and a place named Mu Shu must have great Mu Shu, right? Mr MS described to me his version of MS, I heard him say something about a burrito, but I really wasn't paying too much attention as I smugly thought I knew everything there was to know about Mu Shu! Boy was I wrong! When I get it, it's bigger than my forearm. It's packed full of shrimp, veggies and fried rice. Wow, what a great flavour!  You've heard of Asian fusion? This is Mexasian!"}
{"text":"Mu Shu is an all time favorite of mine!  I have been going there for about 5 years now - the owner Gary and the staff are all so nice!   The place is like a Mongolian BBQ but 10x better than any one that I've ever been to - the bowls are twice as big, you don't have to touch the meat, it's cheaper and it just tastes fresher!  The food is delicious and you always have plenty to take home!  Seriously, I can put some food down but I always end up with a full take home box.    You should definitely try this place if you haven't!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent selection. Particularly like the create your own stir fry where you pick a bowl full of veggies and add meat, sauce and rice or noodles of your choice. Cooked fresh for you. Delicious health choices. Love it"}
{"text":"Mushu is great! My boyfriend and I come here a couple times a month and the owners are always working and remember us every time. They are extremely friendly and the service is great. The mushu wraps are great, but we have never been disappointed by the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Love this place! If you like the idea of mongolian BBQ grill like YC's, then you'll definitely love this place. I love that you can pick what kind of sauce you like, your veggies, and either noodle or rice, and they do the rest! They make sure your food is yummy! They also have a regular menu as well which is also delicious...Definitely inexpensive for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"Mongolian Beef, Orange Beef, chicken egg rolls, Any of the Fried Rices. All 5 star. Totally Delish! The mu Shu Wraps and lemon chicken are good too. This is the best place near us. Our only go to. Fast, always good and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am giving three stars because of the variety of fresh vegetables you are able to self--select for your stirfry. I was not at all impressed with the seasoning options because they did not pop with flavor and taste relatively bland. They definitely give heaping servings to make sure your belly is full. I had to try the spring rolls because of all of the reviews which said they were excellent. As a spring roll aficionado, I am going to interject that there are several restaurants in the valley such as Chanpen and Unfogettable, which offer much better spring rolls at a better price as well. These taste pre-fried=greasy. Although the fountain drinks are in the dining area we're just can reach, it is only an option for the wait staff to give you your drink and it is not assumed that you would want a refill= 1 cup of fountain drink for $1.95. A little bummed that there is not a kids menu or kids portion. My four-year-old's chicken teriyaki was a whopping $9.95"}
{"text":"I've been here before and loved it. However, I don't often find myself in this area, but was glad to be able to return last month. Stir fry is one of my favorites and always results in some delicious leftovers. If you aren't in the mood for stir fry, they have other options on the menu, all of which look delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years and except for one time where I had an issue with the food I've always enjoyed eating there.  The prices are very reasonable and the food terrific.  The owners are.usally there helping serve and helping wait tables.  Visit for lunch and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"There is no option for an individual 4 1/2 stars, but that's what I'd give it. There are better Chinese restaurants, but the combination of taste, value and service is really GREAT! We always get the stir fry in which you choose the veggies. YUM. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a decade and Garry never fails to deliver. The Mu Shu Wraps are amazing - not your typical egg wrapper make-your-own mu shu, these are gigantic Chipotle-style Chinese burritos! The Mongolian grill is phenomenal, with fresh veggies all hours of the day and plenty of sauce varieties to choose from. And kudos to their Orange chicken, Mongolian beef, and I just recently discovered their pad Thai, which is excellent! Garry always is there putting the personal touches on his dishes. Make sure to check out this neighborhood staple!"}
{"text":"I stopped in and ordered the stir fry bowl with noodle to go. I paid just under $12 and the bowl fed me 3 times. I loaded up on chicken and veggies (mushroom, onion, eggplant, celery, bell pepper, bean sprout, kale) and go the spicy ginger sauce.   I will definitely be back, the ingredients were fresh and it was woked in just a few minutes. The ambiance wasn't the best inside, but it will be in my regular rotation for pick up locations."}
{"text":"So I walk in and it being my first time here my face must have gave it away because the owner walked up to me and asked if this was my first time here. He then walked me through the process, almost everything is made to order except for the daily combo they are already precooked. He handed me a menu which is fairly basic but had some great items on it. I walked up to the cashier and she was friendly and welcoming she gave me some ideas and help me decide on what to get the Mu shu wrap.....AWESOME.... It was stir fry, rice and chicken wrapped in a tortilla, it was heaven.   I would totally recommend this place and will be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Since I didn't really want to cook for Christmas Eve dinner, we had to find a place that was open, and not only did we find this place but the food was great.  The owner/manager was very nice and explained the menu. Since we all decided to have the stir fry, he then helped us decide how spicy for the sauces and also helped us decide what would be best--rice noodles, flour noodles or rice with each of our bowls. The rice noodles were very good with the mix of veggies that I added to my bowl.  I really liked that I didn't have to decide what size bowl, as all the bowls were the same size. I had shrimp in my stir fry. I was expecting smaller ones, but these were medium sized and very tasty.  Food was decent, but the people working here were so nice! Five stars for a great experience on Christmas Eve!"}
{"text":"All i wanted was a little mu shu.. but boy was i surprised at the large portions, the dish i ordered was the Spicy Mu Shu Burrito with Chicken and Beef with Fried Rice.. yeah i paid a little bit extra to get the combination of meats, but to me it is worth it..  The flavors are so unique and satisfying that i wish i could finish two."}
{"text":"This is mediocre Chinese, but for sure there's a lot of yelpers who are giddy about putting stir fry into a wrap.   Like, that's the best thing about this place. An asian-inspired 'burrito' on-the-go. When I've sat down here, I've just been disappointed several times. Whether it was the most bland garlic chicken I've had in quite some time, or the sesame chicken that was loaded with so much sugar that I questioned whether or not the sauce would not be better served on top of a dessert.   My understanding is this used to be a buffet, but transitioned to a 'real' restaurant. I think the buffet quality persists. Maybe someone will come by and correct me and find something I like here, but there's really no rush for me to return."}
{"text":"1st time here for an early dinner. Walking distance from my work so I thought I would give it a try!  I had the stir fry. All fresh veggies to chose from. I got my stir fry with Shrimp. Kung pow sauce and white rice! You fill a big bowl with all your veggies and they cook it up and put two scoops of rice on it too!  I did only count 6 shrimp in my bowl, so if you wanted to save a couple bucks just do the veggies! I never get meat at an Asian place!!"}
{"text":"I've gone twice now. Friendly staff, good food at a great price. The stir fry is good and so is the walnut shrimp."}
{"text":"I've here a few times and the food is great. What I didn't like was the service and the fact that they had lowered prices on yelp but not at their location. Also I highly recommend eating it their, they stiff you on To-go's with portion size and no additional white rice compared to if you were eating their."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, had the potstickers and make your own stir fry (Mongolian BBQ). The potstickers were pan fried on the bottom, steamed on the top, tasted excellent. The choices for the stir fry veggies were great and made for a tasty dinner."}
{"text":"If you want fresh, healthy, Americanized Chinese food in central Phoenix, Mu Shu Asian Grill is your place! This isn't authentic Chinese food by any means and they don't advertise themselves as such, so it's too bad people have taken away stars from their ratings for that reason.   This review is for dinner, never been for lunch or gotten take-out. We have gone half-a-dozen times for dinner since moving to central Phoenix a few months ago and we'll keep coming back. The owners and staff are always very friendly and efficient. The restaurant is neat and clean. The food is consistently fresh and tasty. What more can you ask for?  I am that person who finds something on the menu that they like and then always orders it. For me, that's a small hot and sour soup and their Ma Pao Tofu. Their hot and sour soup is really not very hot or sour, but it is the best iteration I've had flavor wise in the Valley. Ma Pao Tofu essentially means home-style tofu, so it's different everywhere you go. Their version is super fresh and healthy, not greasy or heavy. My dinning companion has let me have bites of all the various dishes he's ordered - shrimp, fish, pork, tofu -  and all of that has been delicious too! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A great restaurant for a quick healthy dinner. Loved the fresh veg bar which was stir fried perfectly with the chicken in garlic sauce. Wish I lived closer to this restaurant as it wound be a great option for weeknight meals."}
{"text":"I ordered stir fried pork. The pork was very salty and uneatable. I told the owner about it and she tasted it and said it is normal and didn't do anything about it. I thought there was something wrong with my tastebuds today. However, one of my coworkers tasted it, and he also said it is very salty. Just like you are eating salts. I had the same pork last time and it wasn't salty like this. I'm not going back there ever again."}
{"text":"Food is great - it's hard to go wrong with it when you can choose your own ingredients (as much as you want). It's reasonably priced, the staff is friendly, wait time is 10 min or so!"}
{"text":"Mu Shu Asian Grill has a fast-food look/feel about it as a restaurant, and it appears most of their business is to-go, but the quality of the food is solid.  On a recent Saturday night, my spouse and I shared orders of peking beef, pork egg foo yung and ma pao tofu.  All three dishes were properly cooked and spiced and served at a piping hot temperature, along with plenty of rice. I think what I appreciated most is that none of our dishes came drowned in the typical, nasty canned sauces that most Americanized Chinese restaurants use.  Rather the food here reminded me of the food you'd actually get in Asia, such as from a street vendor or whole-in-the-wall restaurant.  Prices are quite reasonable too, with entrees ranging mostly from about $8-$10. The vibe of the place and the employee attitudes seemed pretty comfortable too.  Overall I really like this place for casual Chinese dining.  And they even throw a wedge of lemon in your icewater!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Have been passing it for years and finally went a couple of times and was very very pleased. It's extremely clean, the service is mom and pop very friendly, and the food is tasty.   I've tried the hot and sour soup which is tremendous, kung pao chicken which is fantastic, crab puffs which are great, and the create your own stir fry is fun and you can make it as healthy or fattening as you want."}
{"text":"Staff is super pleasant along with the owner. Quick service and food made to order and willingness to make sure you get your food how I preferred it"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim. I placed a take out order instead of dining in.  I loved having this convenience.  The staff when I arrived to pick up my food were very social and friendly.  The dine in restaurant is not what I expected.  It appeared that they had some type of buffet bar as part of the dining experience.  My food was ready by the time I arrived and stayed warm for the whole trip home.  I preface this food review with the warning that I am not a big fan of Most Asian foods. I tried the ginger garlic chicken and was not very impressed.  I'm sure that the food itself was good it was just not what I was expecting.  I also sampled the honey dipped chicken which was the more tolerable dish between the two.  The potstickers were very tasty.  I was a little disappointed with the crab puffs.  There didn't seem to be very much filling inside the fried wontons.  Despite not liking my dish I wouldn't mind trying this place again to see if I can find something on the menu, other than the potstickers, that is worth coming back for on occasion."}
{"text":"From the moment we entered we felt like we were the most important guests and the establishment was going to do everything possible to make our experience first class.  As this was our first visit, the owner/manager explained the menu choices to us and after a short discussion we all decided on the stir fry.   We headed over to choose our vegetables and this was the one piece of our dinner that didn't quite rate five stars as there were only about fifteen vegetable choices and, other than the bok choy, the choices were very American. I was hoping for a few more exotic Asian vegetables to choose from. However, they were all fresh and looked delicious.  We then chose our meat or seafood followed by our sauce. You can also elect to have noodles rather than rice, which I chose, to complement the pork and Kung pao sauce.  When the food arrived it was perfect. The flavor was wonderful. The spices were infused throughout the dish and eating it was a mouth-watering delight.  This restaurant should be on everyone's list of must go to at least once."}
{"text":"A couple coworkers introduced me to Mu Shu over a year ago and I was instantly hooked. As lover of Asian Food, this place is right up my alley. Its a quick and easy concept and you'll end up with lunch, dinner and lunch again the next day - there's THAT much food for less than $9. You pick your meats and spices and the rest is up to you to load up your bowl with veggies as much as you'd like. Don't be scared - load them in there!  They grill it all up and serve it hot over rice. Its delicious and generous. While you wait, you can help yourself to crunchy noodle chips dipped in sweet and sour (delicious) and a soda fountain. I love that you're not waiting on servers but you still get that sit-down lunch vibe. A must try."}
{"text":"We have friends who rave about mu shu. We like it, but not enough to make it regular, and we live just a few blocks away. Price/value is measured in pounds. Friendly service, still it's cafeteria quality"}
{"text":"I love Mongolian bbq, not really impressed with this place.  YC's is much better..."}
{"text":"I've tried Mu Shu a few times, always hoping that it will be fantastic.... always being a little disappointed. When I have gotten take out, it has been the most disappointing. The food takes on the flavor of their containers a little, which is generally unpleasant. The last time I visited, we ate at the restaurant. It was definitely better than the take out. They have build your own stir fry bowls, which are a good value ( I ended up with 3-4 servings of food). I had tons of veggies and beef in a kung pao sauce and asked for it extra spicy. The spice level was minimal. The flavor was a bit bland. The positive was that the portion was huge and the veggies were fresh. I'll probably still come to Mu Shu when I'm feeling lazy (it's less than a mile from home), but it definitely isn't my first choice in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. The people working there are very nice and the service was good. However I ordered the Kung Pao and the dish was just bland. It had no taste at all. Felt like I was just eating veggies and meat in a watery sauce."}
{"text":"My first trip in and it was a good one! I love that I can build my own stir fry and the ingredients are so fresh. The food came out quick and hot. It's nice to find a place that is such a great value and clean inside especially around this part of town."}
{"text":"This is truly a diamond in the rough. It's a cute, non-descript building on the corner of 15th ave & Thomas that you've probably driven past a hundred times. Do yourself a favor and stop in for an inexpensive, absolutely delicious lunch or dinner. Their mu shu wraps are essentially asian burritos and they are not to be missed. The staff/owners are so sweet and friendly, I would return just to chat with them! Great food and great service, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"My friends and I really like this place. The people are very nice, it's always somewhat busy, but not too busy that we've ever had to wait for a table.  The food is great.  Soups are delicious."}
{"text":"We let the owner know it was our first time coming in, he did a very good job explaining how the menu works and was very friendly and patient with us. We got our food fairly quick and it was fresh and delicious! You can tell they use fresh produce and meats, it felt very authentic and healthy. The whole staff was friendly which is very important, because we felt comfortable like if we had known them forever. The owner even goes around the tables to see how everyone is doing which shows how much he cares about his business and customer service. Most of the people there were regulars , the owner seemed to really know the customers even by name which I thought was sweet! I would definitely bring my family back!"}
{"text":"This is a very fast and fresh alternative to the standard fare.  Close to downtown it is a good place to grab some lunch and they do it in good time too.  The wraps are big enough for 2 meals and I have even grabbed one on the way home from work for the hubby and I to eat for dinner.  The veggies are super fresh and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"We have passed by here for years, finally stopped.  We will be back. Wonderful service, amazing food. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor. The gentleman, I'm assuming the owner, makes you feel like you are his only customer."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my favorite Asian lunch spots during the work week! It's like a Mongolian BBQ except it's CHINESE.  You select your meat (chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu), then your flavor (kung pao, classic, teriyaki), then choose between plain or fried rice or noodles, then you get a pretty wide range of vegetables to pick from, such as broccoli,  carrots, cabbage, mushrooms, snow peas).  It can get really crowded on a good work day, but you'll walk out full and satisfied.  I have been going here regularly and the best part about Mu Shu is the CONSISTENCY in the QUALITY!  $10 or less meal with a drink."}
{"text":"On my way in for a late night of work and decided to try this place.  I got the honey drizzled chicken with brown rice and some hot an sour soup.  It is a quaint place where they take your order and call your name when it is ready. There is one lady keeping the front clean and providing refills and boxing up food to go. The music is way old school but adds ambiance.  Back to the food. It was delicious and I loved the hot and sour soup. The honey chicken wasn't heavy, the brown rice was perfect and oh lord that hot and sour soup. I will be back. To summarize YUM YUM."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent, nothing spectacular though.  We went one day after driving past this place for months.  We just always thought it was closed down or something, it never looks open.  The place is a decent size, but not too large.  You can create your own stir-fry, which I should have done, or you can just make a selection from the menu.  The husband and I chose the menu and got sweet and sour chicken.  It was pretty good.  Run of the mill Asian food really.  The portion was really big though and the price was fairly low, so that is always a major plus.  It wasn't bad.  I will probably visit again out of curiosity.  I really want to make my own stir-fry.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town! I order take out here often with my boyfriend.   The Mu Shu burrito is huge, we often share the burrito with another dish. The ingredients all fresh and the dishes aren't too oily.   The service is always kind and friendly. The food is evens better!"}
