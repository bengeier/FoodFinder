{"text":"This food was sooo good!  This was my first time in Canada, so I had no idea where to go for good food.  However, when I saw the gentleman cooking on the grill out front on Eglinton at midnight, I knew we would be back.  I ate everything (in 2 sittings since there was so much food).  The oxtail was falling off the bone, the rice and peas were delicious, and I even ate all the coleslaw!  

The atmosphere is very casual and the people are friendly.  The prices are good for the amount of food you get and....the food is soo good.  I will definitely be back when i return to Canada!"}
{"text":"Everything i said about 'Raps' ... DOUBLE IT! The gentleman in the rasta hat is always a pleasure to chat with and the lady behind the counter is my new BFF! forget about the chicken its phenomenal of course but that sauce!!! I'll drink it with a straw ... I've been tempted to run away with their hot pot LOL ... I'm never going anywhere else for Jerk Chicken. Thank you Raps for being closed the day i walked in to this place."}
{"text":"Lining up here late at night felt umm a little awkward. Reminded me of being at universal studio during Halloween or more uncomfortable than going to Cambodia for vacation by myself. Yet, a little Taipei night market sensation. But having said that, the chicken was tender and juicy. Very different!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just happened to be driving down Eglinton at around 1am on a Sunday morning. We saw the BBQ smokers outside and had to stop in. We shared the jerk chicken and rice. It was delicious!!!! Definitely recommend it you're in the area. Everyone is super friendly, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I would have to agree on this little place that sits in the shadows of Raps. The people here are very nice and well mannered, and the jerk chicken with a touch of sweet bbq sauce on the side was to die for. I liked it better than Mr Jerk on Wellesley.......accept Mr Jerk has those incredible sandwiches."}
{"text":"Had the intention of visiting another jerk chicken place in the area but luckily it was closed because I wasn't disappointed here.  

Ordered a small jerk chicken with peas and rice. Had plantain on the side.  

Went outside to get the chicken fresh from the BBQ.  

Friendly staff and yummy food. Can't find wrong."}
{"text":"Wayne and sweet mama - u are forever consistent and hard working. i know i can always get a warm welcoming and a good dose of soul food at the best value in all of Ontario i could say. them ppl at Hot Pot work their  fingers to the bone. The traditionally BBQ'D Jerk chicken fresh off the grill goes perfectly with your specialty gravy (i always ask for more.. i am an addict sure) and the coleslaw and rice n peas play their part magnificently in this Kings dinner for $10. The BBQ man has rightfully earned his dibs on my first born child lol. still open til 2 or later most nights"}
{"text":"It was late and I was actually looking for Raps but they were closed for the evening (strange). Anyhow, I was craving jerk and it so happens that these guys have a batch smoking on the sidewalk of the street. So I figured if they can survive next to Raps then their jerk game must be strong!

This is a strange place. So ghetto, so busy, so intimidating yet so good. This is an area of town not for the weak or the ones who wouldn't put their life on the line for chicken. Luckily, I am anything but skittish as I would gladly sacrifice my well being for some delicious chicken.

This stuff is almost as potent as Raps. Well seasoned, smokey, tender with an intoxicating aroma. The only little quibble I have is that it's not as juicy as Raps and they don't have too many options for sides.

If Raps is the gold standard for jerk in this town then these guys are a close second. It's definitely worth the drive out here and put your life on the line for this stuff."}
{"text":"Sorry raps, but this is by far the best and most authentic jerk chicken i have had in toronto. i come here religiously for a quick dinner for my girlfriend and i. 

real deal!"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken is BOMB! The line ups for this will be at least 30 minutes (at least every time I went) but it's great. The chicken is always so moist and the skin just falls right off. There is NO dryness at all. The rice is super flavourful and the coleslaw is a great touch 


4 stars because the line ups are just way to long for a place that is supposed to be take out, but I have no regrets waiting because the food is so good. Also, the hours are super late at night, great after a night of going out and you want some heavy food!"}
{"text":"They do an awesome jerk bbq chicken and on Friday and Saturdays, amazing jerk bbq pork.  More of a take out restaurant, they have a huge charcoal bbq sitting out front at night.  Great food and nice people."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best jerk chicken and pork that I've had in the city. It's a very simple establishment that opens late but they bbq the meat outside in a steel drum, though I'm not sure if this is only on Fri/Sat nights."}
{"text":"Anyone who can post up on the same block as Rap's, hold their own and earn my Jerk Chicken loyalty is legit. The seasoning on the chicken is a little less in your face than their more famous neighbors, but I think the gravy here is tastier, better rice and peas, and count on a more generous portion. Either way, you can't go wrong, but Hot Pot is definitely a sleeper in the Jerk world."}
{"text":"The throwdown is on! Oakwood Village (Toronto) is the home of one of the best Jamaican Beef Patties. The place is iconic and has been around for decades. The Place is Randy's Patties (I'll review that next time I visit). But also on this strip of Eglington the home of three popular Jamaican joints that serve up jerk chicken into the wee hours of the morning. In fact, they don't start serving until 18:00 (Jamaican time, so it's really anywhere between 17:30-19:30 and I recommend that you don't come until at least 18:30). Regardless of when you arrive, expect to wait, there's always a line. Always.

There is metered street parking as well as a Green P nearby; and you can probably find free street parking on the adjacent streets. The area isn't the best, and the locals can probably smell fear, so don't show any of it. Service doesn't really exist even though there are tables, the business is 99.99% take out. The three restaurants competing are less than 100' apart. They are: Hot Pot, Raps, and Spence's.

All three places serve a variety of Jamaican cuisine, saltfish (cod) and ackee, goat, ox tail, plantain, rice and peas, etc. but the focus of this throwdown is JERK CHICKEN. All three places serve it the same way. You go into the restaurant, line up to order, pay, and receive an empty take out container for your chicken order. The prices are all the same for the same size containers. Small is $5, Large is $10. Cash only. Bring exact change.
Your container is simply filled up. No measuring, no weighing, your portion is what the chef puts into your container.

There are basically two elements to Jerk Chicken; there's the flavour of the chicken itself (spices and dry rub), and the flavour of the sauce that complements it. For all three places, the chicken is cooked in the ovens inside the restaurant and finished off on the charcoal grill outside. Wood chips are added for extra smokiness. Your order is served \"Street Meat\" style, the chicken is removed hot off the grills, chopped up, and put directly into your container. Sauce is optional, but if you get it, they put it directly onto the chicken (no separate containers)... you can't beat street meat!

Hot Pot's jerked full chickens. You can get both white meat as well as dark. I didn't specify the type of meat I wanted and got a mixture of both. To keep this throwdown on an even playing field, I will only compare the dark meat with Raps. Once again, I asked for sauce on only half the chicken in the container.

The chicken. Cooked well and thoroughly. The skin was not as crispy and the meat was a little drier in some areas due to some of the chicken skin being mangled up (not from chopping the chicken into pieces either). The chicken skin was also a little soggier without the majority of the fat being cooked off. A little more smokiness to the meat which was nice.

The rub was not very prominent here. very light flavours of allspice, paprika, and a slight sweetness to it. Without the sauce, there was just about no heat to the meat. A bit disappointing really. 2 stars.

The sauce. There are two types, mild and spicy. I went for the spicy. The sauce had a nice dry heat to it, reminding me of a good dry wine. No signs of tabasco here, crushed seeds are visible revealing the chili peppers from which they came. The consistency was simiilar to gravy, not clumpy, but chunky in some spots. The sauce was definitely a nice add to the chicken providing some needed moisture as well as flavour. 3,5 stars.

Overall, nothing special really stood out with this chicken. The sauce was definitely the key here, and I think the main reason for all the good ratings. But for me, I use sauce for dipping rather than having a dish come smothered in it. Jerk Chicken is no different. I will have to go against the grain of other Yelpers here, 3 stars overall.

Next up: Spence's

*** Note *** Well, it looks like I forgot to check into Spence's, so I'll be posting my review the next time I visit. I will also post the winner of the Oakwood Jerk throwdown!

Price:
Prices were really good and was cheaper than most Caribbean restaurants!"}
{"text":"Came here around 11pm on a Friday night. Festive atmosphere with the sidewalk grilling and a whole bunch of people milling around. I had the jerk chicken on rice with gravy and hot sauce. Both the jerk chicken and rice were super flavorful and the hot sauce was appropriately spicy (but didn't blow my head off). Only issue was that there were a couple small gritty bits of bone in the rice, which were unpleasant but didn't ruin the meal."}
