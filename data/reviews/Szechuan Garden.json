{"text":"This place is outside of the \"mall\", closer to the Jacob outlet (to the left if you're facing Jacob).
Plastic sheets are the substitute for table cloths. It reminds when I was young when all the Chinese restaurants used them. 
I came here with my friend who just went here last week and enjoyed it. We ordered the duck roll pie, mushroom with shredded chicken noodle soup and pork & chive steamed dumplings. 
The duck roll pie is like Peking Duck wrap just a bit less crispy but just as fatty (which makes it delicious).  It's a bit difficult to eat as it falls apart easily so maybe not the best choice if you're coming here with someone that you're trying to impress. 
The mushroom with chicken noodle soup came with wood ear mushrooms (love them), king oyster mushroom, a lot of chicken pieces, bok choy and of course, noodles. It was a bit bland so we had to add hot sauce to it. Wouldn't get it again. 
The 8 dumplings were plump and really juicy. Yummeh. 
I think I'll have to come back and try other mains to really make a better call on this one."}
{"text":"The lunch special is not bad for the price. The food here is decent, environment is a lot better than other small restaurant. Nothing is really impressive though. Very suitable for fast work-day lunch."}
{"text":"We randomly went into this place for lunch last week, and once again was shocked by the amazing lunch deal. As cheap as $5.95, you can get a big bowl of noodle with soup / soy milk! and for $3.99 you get an order of 8 steam dumplings too! I got the soup, which was hot and sour soup, it was delicious! and then for the main, I ordered the rice cake in soup..yay, it was a cool day, I just want hot soup. The rice cake was a bit over cooked....but it got lots of veggie inside...it's good for me because that's the way I like it. Two other people ordered beef noodle, and they look good too.

Taste was a ok though....in fact two of us (out of four total) felt slight discomfort in the afternoon.  The other two people were fine."}
{"text":"I am pretty much of the same mind as Vivian W. This is a great lunch place with clean well prepared food with ridiculous low price. When we ordered the sesame beef and the salt and pepper pork we both were amazed at the sizes of the portions less than $ 5.00. The hot and sour soup was not very good but otherwise this is a great value on par with the food fair in the adjoining mall. We certainly will return."}
{"text":"Szechuan Garden is located in First Markham Place (FMP) among the plethora of other restaurants. It's always hard for my gf and I to agree on which restaurant to go. 

We went during lunch time where dim sum was 20% off. 

We ordered:
Steamed bak choy and pork dumpling (8) - Though it is served in 8 instead of the usual 12, the dumplings were big. It was tasty and contained a savoury soup. Soup kept bursting out of my dumpling with each bite. Luckily, the table was covered in plastic sheets... 

Shanghai steamed pork dumpling (6) - Same broth as served in the other steamed dumpling. I should have just ordered 1 serving of steamed dim sum instead of 2. Likewise, it was still as tasty. 

Braised lamb in noodle soup - The noodles were hand made, served al dente. One thing that this restaurants does well is that it doesn't hold back on serving size. The bowl is enough for 2 people to share. The soup base was flavourful.

I left feeling satiated, without that greasy/bloated feeling I have with most Asian restaurants. A great option for vegetarians as well !"}
{"text":"great place out in a shopping strip mall. 
ordered a spicy beef noodle - great noodle and the portion are huge.
pork dumpling, eh.. you can skip those, I don't think szechuan is known for its dumpling.
this place have similar name makes it remind you that you are entering a spicy food restaurant. but apparently, its not. it just like other regular chinese food restaurant.
I also ordered sticky rice roll (not that great) I was hoping it would taste like what I had in taipei (street vendor, they were awesome)
they have tons of deep fried snacks food (surprisingly, like variety of pan cakes)  
price is not bad too. but, when you order a couple of small things, they all adds up. so be careful what you order, their portions are big (for me anyway)
good place for you to take your taste bud adventure, not too far from TD.
the service tend to be slow, I think most of the chinese restaurant that sells dim-sum will take time to prepare the food, where if you are in the US (most of it), they already have the food pre-heated. so for dim-sum, the order will come out much faster."}
{"text":"Good food, knowledgeable and friendly staff, decent pricing.  Perfect."}
{"text":"MSG Alert!!

If you are allergy to MSG, don't even bother ordering their \"Hot Pot\"!!

Mix Vegetable & Pork Hot Pork ($12.99) is tasty because of the massive MSG they put in. I have the typical MSG reaction the whole night... not even drinking a whole litre of water help. And I thought I am immune to MSG with all these years of eating out.. and boy am I wrong!

The dumplings still great...but just make sure don't order any of those \"Hot Pots\"!"}
