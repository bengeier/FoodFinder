{"text":"another place i would not go to again.
took drink orderes wrong food was cold or wrong or late .
took a long time to come out with beers and drinks or waters. was faster if you go up ur self and go right to the bar. i even had the bartender stop what she was doing, pick up the ringing phone at 11:30 at night and talk on the phone while there are people waiting to have there drinks.
we as a large group ordered appetizers before our main food.
wings, fries,machos things like that time passes and passes and passes and passes.  we never got our food then all the food comes out at once everything comes at once. appetizers and main food we sent back all the appetizers back to the kitchen. the main food was cold or given out incorrectly to the person. it was a huge mess, wait staff had a attitude problem, not going back again thats sure. this is another place that if they keep going like this they will die in business."}
{"text":"this Irish restaurant is another local favourite. it's kinda scuzzy, and reminded me of the 'rough-aroound-the-edges' kinda bar. the place is packed with locals, which aren't really classy, but very friendly, blue-collar workers, and the food is good for the price- although lately, i wasn't impressed, as their menu isn't updated, and a few dishes i ordered were no longer available. some of the waitstaff look like pure hicks, and some are great. they have nightly specials, and the wing night (Tues & Thurs( are busy, and fun. Fridays they have karaoke."}
