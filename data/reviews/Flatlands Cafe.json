{"text":"Honest Review From an Honest Person:  Just ate there as I am visiting the city and happened to walk by.  I like little home grown type restaurants and had a closer look.  At lunch time I could see many customers inside so I had a good feeling about the place.  The outside could use a little update etc. but I ventured in.   They greeted me right away and pointed me to the order line.  It is not run down by any means but still could have used a little more organization or something to make it pop.   I ordered from the chalk board menu - Chicken with Vegetables on a wrap and they were quick to complete the order.   In total with a chip and drink it only came to about ten bucks.  the food tasted great and I had no complaints.  it really hit the spot and was a healthy alternative to the fast food places near by.   I could tell they took great pride in their store and even the coffee creamers had cold ice packs under them so I knew they were on top of things as far as food safety goes.    Still in town a few days so I might go back again tomorrow."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but the prices are just too high for what you get in my opinion. I went there twice -- the first time I think I had a ham and cheese sandwich, the next time a tuna salad sandwich. Both were priced at $7.95. Please note we're not talking about grilled ahi tuna or something... just basic tuna salad, meaning canned tuna mixed with mayo and maybe a couple other things. We're also not talking about a sub bun, just two regular sized slices of bread. Maybe I'm cheap, but both times I felt like I didn't really get my money's worth. The produce on the sandwich was also less than fresh -- not rotten, but brown spots on the lettuce and grainy tomato. The sandwiches were fine, they tasted decent, but I would have felt satisfied paying about $4 instead of $8. My coworker got a container of quinoa salad that couldn't possibly have contained more than four bites, and it cost $4.25. I hope it was the most amazing salad ever at over $1 per bite."}
{"text":"Not bad but paper plates, styrofoam cups, and plastic cutlery means never again for me.  Protein breakfast was fine but nothing special, basic grocery store breakfast sausage."}
{"text":"Accidentally found with quick search local area sandwich stop. Just right. I having only a snack item.  Both guys having sandwiches. They say are good. Looks good to me. Great service here and accidental find parking close. We would return."}
