{"text":"This is a love it or hate it hole in the wall place.   My wife and I love it.   Pizza is different as it has American cheese on it.  Neighborhood isn't the best but they keep it clean inside."}
{"text":"Because P&M was highly recommended by my boyfriend.. I was so intrigued to learn of this pizza .. since I am no doubt a huge NY style thin crust pizza fan.  I had to find out what was so special about this pizza..  I have heard you either \"love it \" or \"hate it\"  well folks.. the verdict is in and I in fact love it!    The pizzeria is located in downtown Arnold.. off the beatn path no less.  I got a warm vibe just walking into the restaurant.  We sat at a cozy booth in the back part of the restaurant.    Started off with red ribbon \"cherry\" sodas which were totally appropriate (bottled Natrona Bottling Co) and so delicious and refreshing.    Plenty of options to the menu but we were interested in the \"original thin crust P&M pizza\".   It arrived piping hot ..  and within a few minutes was cool enough to enjoy.  The cheese is what makes the pizza so good.. and lack of dough too.  I love the combination of the pepperoni and cheese.   The cheese blend is a big secret and their specialty.  I think its nacho cheese or similar type cheese.   It's no doubt good and worth the trip to get the pizza.   $10.00 for a large - original\" thin crust pizza.. totally the right price.     Its not typical pizza.. its unique.. and definitely worth it.    Cash only folks.. no credit cards accepted.   Bravo P&M !!"}
{"text":"I like how it's a hole on the wall, that's part of the charm. Now their NY style is pizza is damn good. But their original is some of the worst tasting burned pizza I have ever had. I would rather melt velveeta on cardboard. Avoid like the plague."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza. They specialize in a thin cracker like pizza. The pizza I don't care for unless its their regular traditional without the weird processed cheese. The crowd at times is uppity uppity which is odd. Parking is horrible and be sure to lock your doors.  Pizza is one of my all.time favorite foods, their is expensive and not great. Phillipies has something like it call the birdville taste WAYYYY BETTER! Seating is cold and uncomfortable and not good for families. Id say pass this place up for much cleaner, cheaper, and delicious alternatives."}
{"text":"The same thin pizza has been made here for many years. My Sicilian grandfather would take me here to eat pizza when I was just 6 years old. So many stories and memories at the P&M Pizzeria!!!"}
{"text":"Like someone else said love it or hate it. Cheese is different thin pizza but the best out there. It's a little dive bar usually take it to go."}
{"text":"P&M Pizza is awesome.  The Original P&M is unique to this area.  It has some crazy cheese blend that is really tasty.   It's worth trying.  If you don't like the Original P&M, you should try the New York Style pizzas.  Their NY Style is some of the best pizza I've had in the area, and I've had a lot of pizza from the \"best\" in the Burgh."}
