{"text":"Headed to Jackie's hoping to discover a hidden gem within the Eau Claire food court...

Wanted to love this place but am gonna have to give it another try. Have eaten my fair share of Thai food in my time and grew up in SE Asia, so my knowledge of the regional food is decent. Had the Thai Basil Chicken thinking it would be made fresh. It was served out of the ready made selection. I was warned that it was the hottest dish out of the day's offerings. Was quite watery with not a whole lot of flavour. Didn't notice much if any basil flavour or leaves in the dish, though it was quite spicy as advertised. The carrots were quite soft, almost mushy. I guess I envisioned a dry stir-fry bursting with Thai basil flavour. Not so much. Even Thai Express, another local food court Thai food provider makes a product with more flavour than this - though their product lacks in protein content. I will say the serving was quite generous and the chicken was tender.

Thai iced tea was quite good however and I thought the chilis, cilantro and various seasonings available at the counter was a classy touch. 

I do realize this is a food court establishment, but with mostly great reviews on here, was hoping for something that surprised me. Will give it another try soon and hope for a better showing..."}
{"text":"Jackie's Thai is a true hidden gem. I would never have expected to find such authentic and delicious Thai food in the food court of Eau Claire Market. Ever since trying it for the first time late last year, I just can't get enough of their food. My favourite dishes are the Pad Thai and the Chiang Mai Noodle Soup. The Pad Thai is always available whereas many of the dishes, such as the Chiang Mai Noodle soup rotate. You can look on their website to see what dishes are available on a given day. I love the Chiang Mai Noodle Soup because it has such unique flavours and is unlike any other Thai dish that I've had before. I also like their papaya salad which is made to order. Jackie's is my go to place whenever I'm craving Thai. Their prices are really reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a quiet corner of the Eau Claire Market food court is probably the second best Thai food in the city (after White Elephant). I know what you're thinking: \"Another five stars, Paul?  You must be getting soft in your old age.\" But what's not to like about a plate full of delicious curry (6 choices every day) and rice for $7.50? It's rich with coconut milk and great traditional Thai seasonings.  I'm not a big green curry fan, but gobbled up Jackie's with gusto. It helps that you can customize with the  numerous and attractively presented serve-yourself toppings by the cash register , ranging from peanuts, cilantro and limes to homemade chili oil to manicured green onion stalks.  I'm definitely coming back for the soup and Pad Thai, as these look great too.  If you're in Eau Claire, eating at Jackie's is a no-brainer based on flavour and price."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!
It's located in the food court in the eau Claire shopping center. 
The food was delicious and true to genuine Thai flavors. The dishes were portioned just right with either small or regular size. They have several veggie options for those who don't eat meat. The prices are very reasonable $6-$10 depends on what you get and they do have some specials. You can taste everything that's already made and make up your mind like that. 
I was very happy with the food (and I've been to Thailand many times). Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"With such a high rating, I had to try this  place out.

Service was friendly but I was surprised that I was given a bag to pack my own food for takeout.  I would have expected with 4 items, they would have packed it for me.

I tried the green curry chicken.  It wasn't anything special.  Flavour was good but the chicken pieces were dry and way too much potatoes.

I also tried the oxtail soup.  This was a much better taste experience.  The oxtail was very tender and the soup was tasty.

It's good for a food court, but I wouldn't make a special trip if this was a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai I've had since Thailand.  Chiang Mai noodle soup is great and so is the Tom-Yum-Goong"}
{"text":"I went here because of Yelp reviews. Yelp reviewers are often way off. This is not a 4 or 5 star place. I had green curry with chicken. Lots of rice, very little chicken, and no vegetables. The taste was slightly bland. I will not go here again. I am not from here but how can someone say this is your best Thia food.  Very dissatisfied with Yelp reviews lately."}
{"text":"I think the other ratings were by the employee or owner.  Wow. Worst mush ever. Not even any Thai flavors.  I will say that it was spicey hot. But really some of the worst mall food I've had.  I've been to Thailand ,  they would be ashamed."}
{"text":"Tried this today based on the positive reviews.  I tried the Penang beef.  I've tried this at several other places and they have all been better than here.  There is nothing wrong with it.  It was just very middle of the road.  Not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Not too shabby at all. Tasty Thai food here. I'm sure it's not the best in town but pretty good actually."}
{"text":"I go here quite a bit and today I opted for the basil chicken. It was tasty, but the \"small\" portion was just that, \"small.\" Perhaps it was due to the size of the to-go container. Either way I was a bit disappointed and hope the portion I get next time is more reasonable."}
{"text":"If you want affordable Thai that is the best in the city this is it. The chicken salad is absolutely amazing. If you try it you will be hooked."}
{"text":"How could we not drive across town to try this Yelp 5 star rated Thai place?! Thai ranks up there as one of my fave cuisines and Jackie's did not disappoint. They know their Thai!

Did you know that when you buy 3 dishes you get one free, even for take-home? Lots of food but we know it will freeze well if it need be.

The staff were so accommodating and friendly. The menu is ever-changing but what they do have, you are welcome to try a sample. I love that they do not hold back on the spice!
What I loved the most so far is the Pad Thai and the red curry with pineapple on rice. SO warming! 
We also got to try the papaya salad and this was tasty and unique. 
I blocked out the whole food court ambiance and was lovin' every bit of my pad thai with shrimp dish. (This particular noodle dish does not keep as well if taking home than some of the other rice dishes)

I have no complaints whatsoever and all the compliments I have read on here on Yelp for this place are warranted. It was nice to see Jackie working away in the kitchen putting all her love into her food! You will taste it in each bite!"}
{"text":"Five-star Thai with a food-court front.

Who would have thought that nestled amongst a Subway®, a Taco Time®, and all your other usual food court suspects, would live some of the best Thai food that Calgary has to offer (certainly that I've ever had).

The menu changes depending on what Jackie (and yes, it's actually Jackie who makes the food) has cooked up for the day.  There are usually red, green, and yellow curries, but the meat and veggie combinations are switched up all the time. It's wonderful - every visit feels like a new experience! 

They always have creamy delicious options that would be friendly towards most peoples' taste buds, but if you are in the mood for something a little spicier, be warned, they are not afraid to turn up the heat!

As far as the ambiance - well, it's in a food court, so it's plastic trays and paper plates all the way. The food is fantastic, and the price can't be beat. 

Grab a couple meals to go, take a two minute walk to Prince's Island Park, and you've got yourself a memorable date-night for under $20."}
{"text":"Aroi!  (Delicious)     

Friendly staff and great food.  And you can purchase frozen Thai Curry :)"}
{"text":"I had the yellow chicken curry and it was delicious. Buttery smooth flavours. Wonderful."}
{"text":"OK, before I get pounced on for not giving Jackie's 5 stars...I will clarify that I would like to go back to try their other dishes.  And their prices are pretty good to get freshly-made Thai to go.

Their curries smelled delicious - just a bit heavy for me at lunch, so I opted for the Prawn Pad Thai.  I've had better.  The noodles very greasy, the dish had almost no flavour (other than being covered in onions which I painstakingly picked out), and the prawns were cold and tasted like the fishy-fake-frozen ones.  

Again, I would go back to try other dishes as I love Thai food...but the Pad Thai was disappointing."}
{"text":"I didn't expect to have an awesome Thai meal in the food court of the Eau Clair mall, but here we are. At Jackie's Thai you can buy a meal to eat there or grab a container of pre-made dishes to bring home. 

You can choose either a single dish or a combo plate to try a variety of the flavourful recipes. On my first visit, I chose a two item combo including thai green curry chicken with bamboo shoots and \"Spirits in the Garden\". My favourite was the latter: a red curry chicken dish including yams and peanuts. Both dishes were rich with amble sauce. 

The plating leaves something to be desired, with both curries plus rice piled high on a too-small paper plate. But, for the quality and price of the food, I will forgive this shortfall.

If you are downtown, make sure to visit this small business in the back corner of the Eau Clair food court!"}
{"text":"all the pictures of the place are totez wrong.  these dishes  no longer exist, those food items are gone , forever deleted by tape on the menu.  I imagine they were losing too much money on heaping piles of beef, so its incredibly misleading.  Too bad you cant delete former glory's from years ago that are no longer offered to actually not mislead people like me into eating at another frozen dish place.  The chicken pad tai is meh at best.  All the dishes are 'meh' made 6 months ago , frozen and then heated in a steam tray at the beginning of the week? or who knows really whenever they finally run out and have to go to the freezer to grab more slop.  throw some peanuts on it and enjoy?    I'll never be back, save yourself the trip and hope that eau claire is finally demolished to make way for skyrise condos"}
{"text":"The highest level of food you could receive from a food court.

I'm a big fan of Jackie's because of what it is: very decently priced and tasty Thai food. The rating of this place can be misleading as it implies that Jackie's is the best Thai food in the city which I disagree with. I head over there at least once a month because it's of great value and they have tasty curries. It's awesome for a food court and I've been meaning to try their take home food.

Food court prices for delicious Thai food."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise for food court food. The owner came out to our table with an additional small heaping plate of Pad Thai for us to try. I tried the chicken and pineapple curry on the recommendation of the owner, tasted like they used fresh pineapple instead of canned, very tasty. Had the two meat combo with rice , Paneang curry, the pineapple chicken curry and the sample of Pad Thai, all tasty and authentic. This food court Thai was better than a highly rated sit down Thai restaurant we tried the week before. Highly recommended for a delicious quick dinner when near Eau Claire market or going to the movie theatre (Tip: Eau Claire cinema has the lowest prices for first run movies in Calgary)"}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best Thai in Calgary!
Yeah, it's in Eau Claire (aka the Dying Mall), but this place is too legit to quit.
I've spoken with the extremely nice owner and it turns out it's his wife and sister who came over from Thailand and make traditional recipes for their restaurant.
Me and my main squeeze always share the \"Thai Style for 2\", which is 4 curries and rice for $25 - a hell of a deal! 
I typically love their green curry - full of chicken and bamboo shoots and just the right amount of spice.  Their pad thai is drier (read: not as oily) as the thai you know from food court food, but seriously addicting.
But my new fave is the Springtime in the Garden (or something like that) - slighlty spicy curry full of spinach, sweet potatoes, chicken and coconut milk. Soooo good.
They have tons of \"after toppings\" to add to your meal too - bean sprouts, limes, chili oil, etc.
Give it a try, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Jackie's is a solid place for decent thai food at reasonable prices in a food court. I don't think it's the best thai food in the city. It is very convenient since they do sell takeout (do not need to pre-order) which you can get in hurry on your way home from work.  My favourite dish is the seafood curry (usually frozen) because it is very spicy with lots of flavour.  At lunch you can share the meal with a friend for about $20 and there's an abundance of food."}
{"text":"This is a new space in the Eau Claire food court- it replaces the venerable and not-all-that-great Touch of Ginger Viet place. Menu changes all the time but there's always a good assortment of curries and stir-fries (basil, ginger, etc), noodles and salads. I had the panang curry with beef and the green curry with chicken. Excellent loud flavours, especially the panang. They don't do what too many Thai places in town do which is to skimp on jasmine rice- they cover your plate with rice and then spoon the curries on top, proper Thai style.

During Folk Fest I eschewed  most of the onsite truck's at Prince's Island and ate three meals at Jackie's. Every one of them was the unique (to me since I've never seen it on another Thai resto manu) Chiang Mai chicken noodle soup. It's not \"soup\" like pho with a thin broth; it's more like a Thai version of fettuccine alfredo but but with rice noodles and a coconut-milk based sauce, incredibly rich, to which you add these house-made pickled mustard bits. I've never had anything like this and it was spectacular."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look like much but it's delicious! The owners are so nice and generous. I often crave their green curry!!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try out this little Thai place in the Eau Claire Market Food Court. I had the papaya salad (which was freshly made) and the red chicken curry with rice.  The red curry was really good!  The papaya salad was a nice compliment to the fiery curry dish."}
