{"text":"I really like the food here. The best deal, I think is the 2 dinner for $50. I usually pick the triangle looking appetizers and they bring you lentil soup which has chicken and is to die for! Then two main entrees... I love the curry stuff, not a fan of the grill items but still tasty just not my cup of tea. By this point you are almost ready to pop with the rice and the garlic naan bread, chips with the two sauces (brown and green) the brown sort of sweet and sour is my favorite. To top it off you each get a choice of dessert, pick the pistachio ice cream and the rice pudding. You will not be disappointed.  The restaurant décor is great, I can't remember what kind of music they have but perhaps could be more memorable, nice location if you want to walk afterwards... the service is sometimes really good, sometimes they forget to refill your water type thing. My only complaint... oh! And that it would be nice if it was busier  I like to people watch while I am eating."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to JOTC a bunch of times. The food are always delicious, the service is spotty at times but not bad enough to make us not comeback. Now according to my Australian husband this isn't exactly the best Indian food he's ever have but until Phoenix comes up with better Indian food they got our business."}
{"text":"This was only my second experience with Indian food, so let me just say up front I am obviously NOT an expert on this cuisine and don't have much to compare it to.  All I have is my palette!  

With that said, as far as positives go - the restaurant is located in the Scottsdale Mall, nice area and right next to the Scottsdale Performing Arts Center.  The inside is nice too.  I ordered the Chicken Masala (kept it basic and simple).  I thought it was flavorful, I liked it!  It's served with a side of rice.  They serve this cracker bread type thing (sorry, don't know what it's called) for the table when you sit down, along with these 2 sauces to dip it in. Both were delicious, full of flavor.  They had a spicy and sweet quality to them.  I also ordered one of their special cocktails, can't remember the whole name - Madarajah something.... it had bourbon, ginger and lemon.  Was very good!

Now for the negatives....we went on a Friday night, the place was almost full and there were 3, THREE servers working the entire restaurant, INCLUDING the bar.  So basically the \"bartender\" was a server who was leaving the bar unattended to take tables in the dining room. (while my friend and I sat, unacknowledged, for 15-20 minutes till we finally went back to our table and had our server just get the drinks for us). I was pretty surprised that on a Friday night there were only 3 people.  Now, they were definitely hustling and running around and working very hard (we were a large party) but in my opinion that is just completely ridiculous to be that understaffed. It creates a tense environment and you feel like you are overwhelming them if you ask for anything.  Granted, our server was very nice and clearly was running his ass off!  The food really didn't take long considering all this, I was pretty shocked.  I am not saying I wouldn't go back, but I would not go back on a weekend when it's chaotic like that.  Also, and maybe this is because I have worked in the food service/restaurant industry, but when the food runner came with our food, they were \"auctioning off\" the food.  This is a peeve of mine, I find it completely tacky and unprofessional.  Not to mention the guy doing it must NOT have understood English because he gave me the wrong dish twice before giving me my order.  LOL.  Again, it's not enough to keep me from returning, but I think they need to stop doing that!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here on a Saturday night recently, and it was our first Indian food dining experience. It was amazing, we are so glad we came here!! 

We ordered these potato like appetizers which were so flavorful, along with garlic naan (bread) and soup.  We also ordered a couple different indian cocktails. We went with the server's recommendation and so glad we did because they were both delicious! For main course we got chicken tikka masala and the lamb entree, every bite was savory and honestly the best chicken tikka I've ever had. My boyfriend says the lamb was his favorite and the best he'd ever eaten as well. For dessert we ordered the chai tea and rice pudding, which finished our meal perfectly! 

The service was exceptional as well. We sat on the patio overlooking the Scottsdale Civic center lawn. An adorable hidden gem with authentic atmosphere and knowledgable/friendly staff!! We will definitely be returning here soon!!"}
{"text":"The service was good, very nice lady! She refill our waters many time! Gave us 10% because one of the plate came very late. The food was just amazing!! I ate the vegetarian korma. First of all I was pleased to see so many vegetarian option and second it was delicious!! My husband was so jealous of my plate that he went back the day after and order it!! Love this place and we will go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my gf went to Jewel of the Crown on a Saturday night and it was incredible from start to finish!!!  Everything was SO good!  From the service to the drinks to the apps to main courses down to the dessert and chai tea....chicken tiki was fantastic and the lamb was the best I've ever experienced.  

We sat out on the patio which was really great, awesome setting and mood.  We will definitely be returning!  Wish we would have known of it sooner but it's a little hidden, a hidden gem though for sure!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to work near the downtown Scottsdale area and being an Indian food lover I've eaten at Jewel of the Crown many times. Each time I was disappointed. 

I've ordered lamb biryani and the rice was mushy and looked at though all of the ingredients were tossed together like a pilaf as opposed to a biryani. 

The dhals I've ordered have been decent but nothing really special. A lot of the dishes taste similar with a generic flavor as opposed to being spiced individually for meats vs. dhals vs. vegetables.

My other complain is the staff refusing to believe I like my food spicy. I have a problem with this in a number of restaurants that assume that due to being a whitey I'm not SERIOUS about wanting my food spicy. SERIOUSLY, I want it HOT. Sheesh.

Their one saving grace is their neebo pani (lemon water), their spice mix for the drink is wonderful."}
{"text":"This is comment to the owner of 'Jewel of the Crown'.

The food was really good.  Customer service was really good.
However, we had a '1' star experience at your restaurant.  

Three of us with a Groupon certificate for $50 visited your restaurant.  Before-hand we called and explicitly asked about any 'catches' we should be aware of.  Being the day of the expiration, or the fact that 3 people are sharing the same coupon would not be a problem, etc.

We were told everything is good and that our coupon will be accepted.

When the bill arrives and the coupon is presented, we are told that we had ordered an 'non-Groupon' menu item and therefore the Groupon cannot be accepted.  We were also told that had we presented our Groupon at the beginning of our meal the server would have told us about the 'non-Groupon' item.

I pointed out that perhaps we should have been told about this 'catch' when we had called earlier and asked about any 'catches'.

This went on for several minutes with our server at which point I asked to talk with the manager.

The manager apologized and took the 'non-Groupon' item to be paid for separately.

The server then came back and said we 'had' to keep ordering food until the $50 limit was reached.  Another set of discussion happened to make it clear that we did not care about 'credit'...simply let us pay the bill and we can let 'burn' whatever credit remained on the coupon. 

However before we had a chance to order, the server came back saying that we were over our $50 coupon anyway, so there was no need to order any extra food.

We were just besides ourselves.  A perfectly good meal and 3 new fans that you had found that would have no doubt been repeat customers and would have brought friends in, are no more.

Here are some suggestions for future situations like this:
1) When a customer calls about any catches regarding Groupon, please tell them about the non-Groupon items on the menu.

2) Apology in words means very little.  We appreciate that finally the Groupon was accepted, however, we were insulted that the order of our friend was taken out to be charged separately.  The 'apology' would have been not to separate out the checks.

3) Have the server do the math before bringing up non-issues with the customer.  Why were we put through the miserable experience of being explained to order more to fit the $50 quota when we were already $12 over!?

4) When customers present a Groupon, it's very unnerving having the server stand there for 30 awkward seconds - reading it like you are at a border crossing out of a communist country.  Just take the coupon along with the credit card and examine it out of sight of the customer.

Again, I appreciate the verbal apology and final acceptance of Groupon.  However we were not there to simply fill our bellies.  Our lunch experience at your wonderfully atmospheric restaurant was shattered.

Regards,
I will gladly remove this review if asked by the owner of Jewel of the Crown"}
{"text":"We went here because it's very close. I've had good Indian food, so maybe I'm biased. We got the Tandori chicken which tasted more like marsala to me. I wanted the grilled taste with the beet flavor, and it wasn't there.  We also got the alu gobi and the cauliflower was way over cooked. The naan was bland, and a little soggy.
The staff was great, very polite and prompt service.
I won't go back as there, as there are way too many other Indian food restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"Great NORTH Indian food, not to be confused with crappy South Indian food. This place has been through a couple of location changes since it first opened in Phoenix in 1985 at 44th St. and Camelback just down from Cork & Cleaver. Its current home in the Scottsdale Civic Center is easy to get to with lots of parking in the adjacent garage. The décor is the nicest I have seen at any Indian place in town and the owners are usually there and make sure the food is consistent and good. They have a wide range of both meat and vegetable dishes and the \"Jewel Dinner\" at only $25 per head is a great way to go for both experts and novices. It includes a rack of grilled meats and fish as an appetizer, a sampling of four or five dishes and even dessert! Also, be sure to try the stuffed breads or \"naans\" they can be had with potatoes, lamb, chicken, etc, and are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Hands down the best Indian food in Arizona.  Excellent staff, super cute patio out front, lovely location.  Usually has a Groupon out so give it a try.  Fantastic chicken tika masala and aloo gobi.  The garlic naan is out of this world.  We have tried a dozen other Indian restaurants and none comes close to this place.  
  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during the week. Not only is it beautifully decorated the serve was right on point. He was very professional.  The garlic naan was hot as well as the food. I had the samosas and the spinach with cheese. All of which tasted great. Perfect amount of spice. The atmosphere is romantic and classy and you leaving full and happy. Amazing! Next time I am in Scottsdale I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is gooood. The food seems fresher than most indian food places, and it definitely doesn't taste like it's been sitting out all day. That might actually be a complaint. I'm so used to eating vegetable pakoras that have been sitting in a vat under a heat lamp that these were too fresh for me to like. You know? It's like being raised on Taco Bell and being so used to that as your definition of Mexican food that when you actually go to a Mexican food joint with fresh ingredients you're like, \"WTF is this?\"

Oh yeah, and it's definitely more expensive than other places in the valley."}
{"text":"Excellent Food!!! Travel all around the world and know Indian food well. This is truly one of the most authentic Indian food you will find.   Same ownership for close to 30 years is proof enough that this is the best Indian restaurant in the Valley of the Sun. Great ambiance and service too!"}
{"text":"As other reviews for this place go, taste of the food is good. Decor and ambience, not so much. Chandeliers had a few fused bulbs, not replaced. During dinner, that does bring down my mood a little bit. We found the prices to be a little steep.. $15.99 for each curry was a little too much. Our bill for 2 people, a la carte .came up to $70 approx. We had chicken and vegetarian dishes. Chicken tikka masala, veg samosa, shahi paneer, onion kulcha, veg biryani. Quantity of food on par with the rest of the Indian restaurants in the valley, if not less.. We went there after reading other Yelp reviews about the food. A long drive from north valley( the restaurant is located on scottsdale rd and Indian school rd). Hardly worth the drive and the cost of the total bill. My husband had the veg biryani. Said it tasted like Paella, a spanish rice dish. And he wasnt satisfied with the taste of his chicken appetizer either.No issues with the curries, though tey could have been spicier."}
{"text":"I do not know why people would ever give this place low stars. Jewel of the Crown has been one of the best Indian restaurants in the valley. They use really fresh ingredients and their food does not have that overwhelming richness most Indian food usually has. I'm indian, and this food is a replica of what my mom makes! AMAZING.

My favorite dish is the Chicken Tikka Masala! It is amazingly good and what they are known for! Everything is priced fairly...after all you are in Old Town Scottsdale. All the other restaurants are the same. Atmosphere is SO beautiful..everything is nice and clean too unlike some other gross Indian restaurants. 

Overall, excellent!!! :)"}
{"text":"I have been out of town for a couple of years and remembered this place quite fondly as my wife and I enjoy eating Indian food on a regular basis.  Regardless, food was only ok, chicken biryani rice was too wet and had large chunks of tomato, onion and green peppers in it - not my preference.  The tiki masala was good, just not delicious as it usually is.  The naan was delightful.  The mango masala was more tart than usual.  Would go here again but will try other restaurants first to see if we can find an Indian restaurant that meets our preferences!"}
{"text":"We had restaurant.com certificate for this restaurant. I called them up almost a month back and told them that i am having restaurant.com certificate - is there any limitations or rules to follow(as there are reviews from customers who had restaurant.com certificate and they had very bad experience). The owner was very rude and told me that don't come on Friday to Monday...I said okay...I was in this area and I had my restaurant.com coupons with me so i decided to go on Wednesday. We were two in number and i told about the restaurant.com certificate itself. So the waiter told us that we can't order thali which we were planning to order. So first order i need to cancel then i went with the second order - this time we were told that for the $25 restaurant.com certificate we need to order minimum of $50 food..that was very ridiculous term..but i thought okay let's do that...but we were told that you can carry out any thing...i was speechless and i decided to walk out. Then this person said that he has already redeemed my restaurant.com certificate, what???? In a nutshell i will say avoid this restaurant..the restaurant was only 20% occupied and these folks have an attitude that you really need to tolerate. On top of it they have made so many rules which will make it extremely difficult for any reasonable guy to deal with them. Just avoid the restaurant.com and avoid this place. Moreover i can figure out there were no indian customers nearby so obviously food is not good and not at all crowded place..why in the world any restaurant will align with restaurant.com or groupon.com if they are good??? Moreover rather than making so many difficult rules and being rude-if they focus some half of this brain into something useful they can increase their sales. This place is definitely not an option - that's it. Because i want my review to be published that's why giving a generous 1 start otherwise they are -ve star place."}
{"text":"Consistently outstanding food. I have enjoyed this restaurant for 8 years. Sometimes the service can be slow but everyone is very friendly and accommodating. A lovely location near the Scottsdale mall and nice ambiance in the restaurant. A nice place to take a date. The hosts are always thoughtful about where they seat guests. The menu is varied and includes vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Not impressed. First visit was last night and food was delivered at a tepid temperature. The cauliflower was actually cold to the touch. My dinner was delivered first and then we waited for my 2 companion meals to be brought to the table. Didn't have too long of a wait but there were no other customers even in the restaurant so really no excuses for not serving entire table at one time and the timing in the kitchen should have been better. Not impressed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time recently.  The food is delicious! If you're looking for amazing, authentic Indian cuisine, this is it!  The leftovers were just as good the next day!  I subtracted one star, because the service could be just a little better, but nothing that would keep me from coming back for more!"}
{"text":"There is very little quality Indian food in the greater Phoenix area, and this place is by far the best. The lamb Korma and chicken tikka masala are both excellent with chunky, lean meat and succulent sauce. Definitely a hidden gem in the valley of the sun."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food! The place is a bit hidden but that's what I liked about it. Great menu, amazing tastes. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"My favorite upscale Indian restaurant in Phoenix, hands down.  Their food is just more flavorful and more carefully prepared than anywhere else.  And the atmosphere is date-worthy.  As good as the best Indian restaurants in major cities like Chicago and San Francisco.  This is the only Indian restaurant in Phoenix about which that can be said."}
{"text":"I've had the same problem with this restaurant that others here have had. The service is essentially non-existent and the food comes out cold/lukewarm and of low quality. However spicy you make your food, it's still somehow obvious that it's just not good.

I recommend driving down the street to Tandoori Times instead. The food, service, and experience is infinitely better."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their chicken tikka masala, lamb saag (maybe spelt that wrong) and a simple made mango lassi here. With the 20% discount here, it is totally worth it! (Believe me, i have had horrible indian food..)"}
{"text":"Very happy with the food, service, atmosphere, and prices.  My wife and I enjoyed the dining experience and was very satisfied with the quality, taste, amd presentation of the food.  We will be back!  We were so surprised at how nice and attentive the staff was.  If we were in the area we would eat there again tonight."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the hate for this restaurant.  I am very very picky about the food I eat, particularly Indian food.  And I have literally eaten at every Indian cuisine place in the greater Phoenix area.  I cant believe people would write a bad review of a place after eating the ONE damn time.  Are you kidding me.  That's like never riding an airplane because you had one bad experience.  I just want to get 1 thing straight.  That older man with white hair is neither the OWNER nor a SERVER.  He is a very good busser.  I've been eating here for most of my life and have never once had a bad experience, food or service wise.  The Tandoori is JUICY and the food can be spicier than hell.  Friendly staff and great atmosphere.  SHAME ON YOU NEIGH SAYERS! SHAME!  Actually reading some of these makes me wonder if its just the competitors putting up BOGUS reviews.  Like Tandoori Times... some one actually said they had better food.... maybe if you had no taste buds and you like everything to be over salted and dry.  Everything is good here I usually get the Chicken Tikka Masala w/ Garlic Naan bread and a Taj beer for dinner.  Lunch is awesome too for 10 dollars I can get a mixed plate (they call it a Thaali) With everything in it, INCLUDING desert!  So what I have to say for all the bad reviewers, stop putting down one of the best Indian Restaurants I have ever eaten at (besides India of course).  Go back today and prove me WRONG... I dare you!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, good food though. Looks the waiters just dont want to work! Good location and decent food but you need to get past frustration, stupidity and next to nil service...."}
{"text":"When I told my mom I just paid $11 plus tax for a plate of daal, she yelled back over the phone in total angry brown mother voice.

\"Vaaaaat?! Are you stupid? Why would anyone pay 11 dollar for daal? Maybe if it had gold flakes. Otherwise, no. This is like stupid place we went to all the time long time ago.\"

See, when I was a little kid, stupid place was an Indian restaurant called Gaylords in San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf because back then, it was one of the only Indian restaurants in the entire Bay Area (yes, the irony that there was a restaurant called Gaylords in San Francisco that had nothing to do with gays or lords has not escaped me). The food was mediocre. And whack expensive. But people still kept coming. Clueless tourists who had no idea what Indian food should taste like and brown people craving for anything remotely resembling something from the motherland.

And so I hate to say this, but Jewel of the Crown is the Phoenix metropolitan area's Gaylords. Because blase lentils have no business costing double digits. Actually, every vegetarian dish is double digits. Potatoes and peas? $11. Curried eggplant? $11! 

\"But it's expensive because it's so amazing,\" you say.

Nope. I've tried around 8 dishes here and the food is pretty much standard fare. Which, if you're a carnivore,  kind of sucks when each dish is $15. Indian restaurants aren't supposed to break your bank, but this place does it with panache. It's kind of like a relic of a bygone era, when it was one of the only Indian restaurants in the Valley, and therefore could get away with its prices and somewhat discombobulated service. But with a new Indian restaurant practically opening every week, there aren't really all that many compelling reasons to go here, especially since it charges twice as much for each dish than everywhere else. Service was standard, so it must be the location you're paying for (which admittedly is nice).

My recommendation: If a sudden intense craving for Indian hits you while you're meandering around the Scottsdale Civic Center, I'd say eat here and go to town. Otherwise, for a better value with your money and probably better food, head elsewhere. Your wallet and your taste buds will thank you for it.

Overall, somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant was awesome. Everything we tried was great. We started with the Pakistani Alu Tiki, just delicious. We were pleasantly surprised to find that most appetizers are gluten free. Save for the Naan, which I hear is great.  I had the Vindaloo and my husband had the Vegetable Korma. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was very nice. They played Indian music - which is a welcome change compared to some ethnic restaurants that play Kenny G.!  Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend wanting to try some indian food. Everything was ok, the food was good, but when it came time to pay we wanted to use a restaurant.com type certificate for $25 off. The waiter came back and quickly pointed out that in the small tiny fine print on the back it says weekdays only. Well I guess \"technically\" they were right, but it was clearly deceiving. Here is a piece of advice: don't juice your customers. Before this happened I said out loud \"we will definitely be back\". Afterwards not so much. So congratulations on paying restaurant.com or whoever you use for your shady coupons in driving away customers and increasing negative reviews. Also we were the only party having dinner around 6 pm on a Friday in this restaurant so I'm sure they're just turning customers away!"}
{"text":"We discovered this restaurant while attending the Yo! Matsuri Japanese Night Festival at the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts and it was a great experience. The outdoor patio was perfect for enjoying the beautiful evening and we were still able to hear the music on the outdoor stage while eating dinner. We shared the coconut shrimp curry dish and ordered mango chutney with both Naan and Bhatura breads. Yum! The food was delicious (the shrimp were huge!) and the service was friendly and efficient from the time we were seated by a lovely older woman. We'll definitely be back."}

{"text":"I used to work nearby and would visit JOTC weekly for lunch. It was never very busy and the lunch waiter would recognize us and get us everything we needed quickly.

The Keema Samosas are delicious!

If you are new to Indian food, I recommend the Non-Veg Thaali. It has an assortment of Tandoori chicken, curry, a veg dish, naan bread, yogurt and rice pudding - all for $10.

My favorite dish and the one I ordered every time was the Chicken Tikka Masala. It's like $15 and doesn't come with naan or rice, but it's worth it. It's a lot of food and it makes me oh-so-happy everytime.

By comparison, the lunch Chicken Curry special for $8 comes with rice AND naan. 

The rice pudding is excellent as well.

I will miss JOTC!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great quality food! They allowed me to setup arrangements for my guest far in advance. We thoroughly enjoyed ourself. All of over were correct and delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian food and well priced. Everything was very flavorful; I can't wait to dine here again. Garlic naan was best I've had and I also loved the chicken curry, veggie korma and chai."}
{"text":"Staying at the Saguaro Hotel and stumbled across this place. this place has great decor and plenty of seating. The food was delicious, Chicken Vanderloo and Tikki Marsala is a must. special thanks to Melinda, great recommendation on the desert pudding. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"First of all, am not an expert on Indian food and we don't opt for it often. Have had mixed experiences in the past. This place had a very good selection of offerings. We liked that the dishes came in mini chafing pots and in just the right amounts. Service was friendly and the decor was pretty. Parking in the municipal deck was free and hope it is also the same for weeknights. The only problem we had was the GPS was not exact in how to find it. Good for groups and nicely priced."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience. Terrible service. We waited five minutes for someone to approach our table and it was the busboy. Fine. He brought ice water. Another five minutes passed and a waitress came by. Ok. We ordered a glass of wine and a beer. That took nearly ten minutes to be delivered. She was pretty useless in navigating the great looking menu. We were on our own. She either doesn't like Indian food or has no opinions, recommendations, knowledge or enthusiasm. We ordered well - maybe just lucky. Frankly I bet everything that comes out of that kitcheon is great. FTR - We ordered the lamb curry and shrimp Marsala. 

The food came out quickly and was delicious. First rate and the restaurant is lovely. We ate our wonderful meal and decided to order coffee and desert. We waited. No one bussed our table (ever) and we never saw the waitress again for ten minutes. We finally decided to get ice cream cones at a shop next door. However we still didn't have our check. After demanding that the waitress bring me my check, I had to get it from the busboy - our hero. The waitress acts like her guests are nuisances and she is doing us a favor to be there. My guess is that she's a long unemployed humanities major that resents waiting tables. Probably recently divorced and still bitter. She doesn't belong in the service industry!!! The owner/manager appeared confused and out of her depth. I suggested that since her kitcheon rocked, she should tighten up the table service. All she could do was apologize repeatedly. I don't want an apology just attentive professional service.

Please don't miss the fact that the food was great. You just may need to wade through and wait out the unprofessionals in the front of the house."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and missing Indian food so went to Jewel of the Crown.  Ordered an appetizer and two main dishes and found the dishes to be very well put together.  This does not seem a place where food is thrown together.  Rather it tasted as if it were just made in the kitchen.  The taste was authentic  and we would definitely come back if we are in the area again.  The staff too was very attentive and friendly.  The only difficulty was finding the restaurant but the owner was very helpful when we called to ask for help.  Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food in the Tempe/Scottsdale area, and possibly the world. Chicken curry, vegetable korma, aloo gobhi, garlic naan, vegetable samosa, and chai tea were all excellent."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is off the charts, great patio, excellent service. I'm super picky about restaurant lighting. I like a dimly lit restaurant. When we got there, the dining room was very bright, so I didn't want to eat inside. We chose to eat on the patio. My boyfriend was getting very hot, so we were going to eat at the bar. Our server asked if we wanted a table and I said no because of the lighting. She offered to turn the lights down and lit the candle on our table. Problem solved! We had a great meal!"}
{"text":"Mediocre and extremely overpriced Indian food. It's about $4 per single garlic naan? $7 per tiny Samosa? $6 mango lasi? Take your business elsewhere. The kicker is not only is it overpriced, it's not even good. Not terrible, but not good either. And the service slow as a snail's pace. Will not be back ever again."}
{"text":"This is our 4th time eating here and it has not disappointed. The restaurant is an authentic Indian setting, the service is great and the food is really delicious. We will continue to come here for our Indian food cravings."}
{"text":"This used to be top our favorite Indian restaurant.  It's very sad to see the quality of food and service decline to the level it has.  After our nearly inedible meal there last weekend we will most likely not return."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Indian restaurant by far in the Phoenix/Scottsdale are.  The food is as close as it gets to eating home cooked Indian food! The chicken saag is outstanding, the mixed kebabs are excellent. I love the dals, aloo gobi (cauliflower with potato), okra, the eggplant bhartha,  the channa bhatura (chickpeas with bread), the kheer (rice pudding) , gulab jaman and kulfi (ice cream) to name but a few. The setting is beautiful in the Civic Center area. This is as authentic as it gets!"}
{"text":"I travelled through two top Indian food states this year (Kerala & Punjab) over the course of two months. Simply, Jewel of the Crown is best."}
{"text":"Great location. Food was good, but not great and it is slightly overpriced. Service was good."}
{"text":"My first Indian food experience was Jewel of the Crown catering at a Thunderbird Global Management graduation party. Not knowing what it was, I scooped up some Paneer Tikka Masala on a garlic naan, and I've been hooked ever since. 

I have now been a customer of Jewel of The Crown for eight years and everything I've ever had on the menu has been fantastic. Being a pescatarian, there is a plethora of choices for me on the menu. If you are vegetarian or vegan, they are extremely accommodating. 

The mango lassi is fantastic for the children, while they have a great array of alcoholic beverages for the adults. Heck, I order the mango lassi for myself it's so good! 

I *highly* recommend getting garlic naan with your entre and then an extra one to take home if you have leftovers. When heating your leftovers up, separate the rice from the entrée, heat on the stove, and broil the naan on high (watch closely!). It will be just as good as it was in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Meh; while this used to be a favorite spot to take guests because of the excellent food and location, it now has only it's location going for it. Food was severely under seasoned,  naans looked packaged, and the chicken tika was served on a non-sizzling sizzler. Sigh, now I need to find someplace to take my guests."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery Wednesday evening via UberEATS. We had chicken kabob, a lamb and veg dish, saag, eggplant, basmati rice and roti, mango chutney and raita. Everything was excellent. So delicious that I had to call the restaurant and tell them. The flavors are really subtle and well rounded. Don't be afraid of the heat, medium was very palatable. I will definitely order again and plan to dine in at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend tonight, and it was very, very good. Service was friendly and attentive, food was excellent, atmosphere relaxing and stimulating. It's a bit pricier than the rest of the Valley, being in Scottsdale, but it's well worth it. Well situated, next door to the SMOCA in the Civic Center."}
{"text":"Every once in a while you just need some good Indian food to spice things up... on those days we always go to Jewel of Crown.  When you walk in you get hit hard by the lovely aromas of Indian spices... reminds you why you came!  We've probably been there 5-6 times this year and it has never been busy. It's kind of sad actually. They have a nice vegetarian selection; my favorite is Malai Kofta... which is veggie meatballs in Masala sauce!  I have also tried Saag Paneer and Bharta Makhni which were also excellent.  My Bf is also in love with the Chicken Masala... and Raita.   We typically order our food with medium spice because we like a bit of kick to the palate!  If you aren't used to Indian or spicy food, I would order medium-mild so you can enjoy the flavors before you decide to kick it up a notch.   Please give Jewel of Crown a try, it's my favorite Indian restaurant and I'm afraid it will go under if business doesn't pick up.... Oh yeah, and you'll enjoy it!"}

Chicken Tikka !!!

Chutney !!!
Chutney !!!

One of the better Indian food places in the valley... lavish enough to sit and pass time (family or friends)... Except for items above, nothing happens to be very great as such but overall nothing happens to be bad too... 

Ohh yeah.. and one more thing...

{"text":"This is our favorite Indian restaurant in the valley. Very nice staff, great food, and a nice atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is fast becoming one of my favorite restaurants. We are here every other week, and have not found a dish we didn't like. The Chicken Tikki Masala and the Chicken Bryani with Garlic Naan are what we usually get. The spice levels are always right on with our tastes. The two servers we regularly see are very nice, and are always ready with a recommendation of something new to try.

It's always quiet, with only a handful of tables full at any given time, but that makes it a nice place for conversation, versus some of the busier places in Old Town."}
{"text":"I like how the food comes out in mini buffet warmer type bowls with the tea lights underneath.  We got the lamb masala and chicken curry - both solid offerings.  However, thought it was a little light on the meat and spices.  We also got garlic naan which wasn't bad but again a bit bland.  I think the prices don't justify what you get, I'd be curious to see what the lunch portions look like."}
{"text":"Yum, love Indian food and this one was not a disappointment. I hold all other Indian restaurants to their standard and many times it doesn't come close to this culinary perfection. There never seems to be a crowd so I hope they stay open. But truly great food - I'd give it more stars if I could! I can't begin to pronounce or spell all the wonderful delights on their menu. You'll just have to take my word for it."}
{"text":"Used to visit the buffet as a child when this restaurant was in original location. Now fast forward many moons, and brought my child for a valentine dinner.

The restaurant was not busy, maybe 20 guests; however the service was horrible. Mostly the staff was seen having conversations rather than tending to guests. Forgetting to fill up waters, table was left un-bussed as the next courses arrived. 

Food was mediocre, cold rice with hardened naan. Flavors of dishes: Chicken Vindaloo, Shahi Paneer, Veg Samosa, Malai Kofta, Tadka Daal were lacking in both depth and interest. 

Definitely not worth returning soon to pay for the over-priced menu based simply on location."}
{"text":"Not too bad, Customer service is outstanding.I can't wait to come back and try more. The location is great. Food is totally typical indian, you wont be disapointed"}
{"text":"Nice looking place with average food and horrible service.  Everything took forever and no one came by to see how we were doing.  We literally watched our server going around setting tables and taking napkins off of empty tables rather than making himself available to us.  He wandered around from table to table in a completely unoccupied area of the restaurant the majority of the time we were there.  The food was luke-warm and nothing special.  I was only here once so I hate to be so down on the place, but based on the other reviews my experience sounds pretty typical.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Vegetarian Menu : made us sick.  

We should have complained and left but we ate it and forever regret it.

We ordered 4 Vegetarian entrees and all were OLD VEGETABLES ( I eat fresh vegetables every day so I know when I'm served old vegetables). 


We went there on a Friday night and from 6:30-7:30pm there were only 3 other patrons."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Indian cuisine I have had 'hands down'....now having said that...I will say that they are not known for their decor or service. But if you can look beyond that....I can clearly say that they spend their efforts then on their cuisine. 
Having grown up amongst their culinary culture and nurtured a desire in cooking some of their specialities - Jewel of the Crown is pretty much tops for me!
My favorite WAS Vig's in Vancouver, but that is now a close second to Jewel of the Crown.
From the Samosa's to start, Mulligtawny Soup, Kormas/Saag/Vindaloo with Raita, finish with Gulab Jamun ---YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I had eaten here before with a friend and when I saw a Groupon for this restaurant I thought I would grab it and treat my husband to some Indian food. So we went there for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and ordered the Vegetable Samosa to start off. They were delicious. I then ordered the Vegetable Biryani and my husband order the Chicken Tikki Wrap. My husband really enjoyed his wrap. My rice was okay. For $14, I thought it would be a little better, but it was okay. Some of the vegetables (peas and carrots) seemed like they came from a frozen mix. I wasn't that impressed. The kicker came when we went to use our Groupon. Even though we had ordered over $25 worth of food without our \"lunch special\", we were told we couldn't use our Groupon  because we ordered a \"lunch special\". We told them that is fine, don't include the \"lunch special\" and just apply it to the other food we ordered, the waiter didn't want to split out the check because it would make the owner mad. I was like what?? Don't make the customer happy - great choice. Customer service is not their first focus. It would explain why they were so few people in there and they need to do a Groupon. There are other Indian restuarants by us with better food, so we won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been to other restaurants serving Indian cuisine (in Sacramento) and Jewel of the Crown delivers. This place impressed me with its understated, elegant ambiance, service and food quality. Not only was the mixed kabob tasty and filling, the presentation was equally impressive as well (please see the photo I took). I think the food was reasonably priced and the service size very generous. I would go back the next time I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Hands down, the most consistent and delicious Indian food in town - the jewel kabob appetizer is a gem in itself.  Naans, curries all outstanding.  It's also one of the few spots in town where we request it \"spicy\" and they actually do it..........it's also extremely convenient for our other favorite hangout where they serve those oh-so delicious swimming pools, er I mean martinis.  LOL"}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT
Located in the Civic Center area next to AZ88 and the theater. This restaurant has been here for years and continues to win local restaurant awards.

Dim mood lighting with lots of indoor round table seating. There's also a small bar area.

MENU
Everything you could want in Indian food and a lot of things I've never seen before. Wine, beer, liquor, etc. 

Garlic Naan - ALWAYS ORDER THIS! It's a must. 

Spicy Chicken Masala - So spicy! But unlike the most spicy options at Indian restaurants in LA, this is edible and worth it. Served with rice. 

Chicken Curry - Good curry. medium spicy isn't really spicy (to someone like me who loves super spicy). Served with rice."}
{"text":"Memorable curries and vegetarian delights. We took a couple of friends for his birthday on a Sunday evening to check it out. Waitress was super nice, has worked there many years. Yellow lentils were rich and delicious, and my wife's eggplant dish was quite tasty. Tikka masala was one of the best our friend had tasted. Not all enjoyed the fried onion appetizer, and the pitcher of sangria could have had more pizzazz. But the naan and rice were prepared perfectly, and each entree was scrumptious. Would most definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"One of the best North Indian restaurants in Arizona.  Their presentation is something you just don't see at other restaurants.  I've always loved Indian food, but my wife has shied away at times.  This all changed when I brought her here.  She loved everything from the Mixed kabobs, to the chicken curry.  I was very excited to bring her here, and have her enjoy it the way she did.  I was also a big fan of their nann bread and their Alu Gobi, which is a cauliflower and potato dish.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Dh and I came here tonight to use or groupon... We've been coming here for the last 20 plus years, and it use to be our go to Indian restaurant! After the visit tonight we will never be back. We got our dishes medium And spicy, but neither had any flavor. We had an eggplant dish And chicken tikka masala, as well as kebabs, soup, and dessert... We decided to splurge and get the $50 dinner for 2. Food was terrible as was the service.... People who had come After us who had also gotten the same dishes and the dinner for 2 left before we had even finished our entrees. Server was so swamped that he had no time to come and check in on us to see if we wanted anything else or to see if we were doing ok. There was also a hair in the rice dish. We will never come back!"}
{"text":"Found this place by happenstance. We had tickets to see a show at the Virginia G Piper theater. We got here early so that we may have dinner. Not having made reservations anywhere we decided to check out AZ88. Well of course the wait was ridiculous so we decided to check out the Jewel of The Crown. 

Much to my surprise the food was excellent! Now mind you, this was only my second experience at an Indian restaurant; so I was a little speculative. I had a Ginger Chicken Kabob dish that was really delicious.  

As for the service, well it was an unexpectedly busy night for them; so it was a little slower than expected. I must say though,  we had excellent service. Our waiter was Gabriel, and he really took the time to explain all the dishes I had questions about. He was extremely helpful and pleasant. He really knew his stuff. 

I highly recommend The Jewel."}
{"text":"My sexy Indian man (as I like to call him) and I decided to have thanksgiving dinner at this place since I didn't feel like cooking and you can never go wrong with Indian food. 
I ordered the house wine which was NASTY. I bet it comes in the plastic gallon from over at Walmart. 
The lamb and chicken kabobs had 2 tiny pieces of lamb. Samosas were dry and the lamb vindaloo had little lamb and a ton of potatoes. My son enjoyed his chicken tikka which was kind of flavorless, but surprisingly not dry. I give this place 2 starts only because I loved the decor."}
{"text":"Very surprised by some of the negative responses here.

I ate at Jewel of the Crown for dinner with my family, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  My waiter was quite nice, and our food was tasty.   Admittedly, the dishes were not among the best Indian I've had, and service could be speedier.   Bottom line:  It's a mid-level spot -- certainly good enough to visit again, just not my first choice."}
{"text":"We ordered take out for lunch and we clearly stated lunch special multiple times. The person on the phone repeated the order and everything was ok. But when we got there, they had billed us for a regular order and overcharged us by 30 dollars. I tried reasoning with the owner who rudely started yelling at me. 
There are plenty of Indian places around. I would skip this one. Not worth the hassle with unscrupulous owners."}
{"text":"I had to chime in for JOT-C (yep, that's what I call it) because I know it very well, and it's gotten an unjustified bad rap from other Yelpers so far. I've eaten here for over a decade. I've brought friends, college classmates, relatives, and dates here. I lost my dad 3 years ago and I have fond memories of dining here with him. I distinctly remember spilling a Coke all over myself the first time I brought him here. I also remember coming here on my very last day of law school, with a bunch of classmates from Employment Law. The folks here have seen their share of special occasions in my life. Wouldn't be true if this were truly just a 2 star experience. 

I don't think it's fair to nail a restaurant with a bad review based on only a single visit, in most circumstances. Restaurants are run by humans, who are allowed to have a bad day now and then. I've eaten here a billion times. Occasionally something has annoyed me. Most of the time the service is prompt. And those things are true of every restaurant I've ever frequented more than once. At JOTC, even if it's not prompt, it has not even once been unfriendly. There is an elderly gentleman waiter in particular who I especially like. A non-Indian friend I came here with once asked him, \"So, what part of India are you from?\" The waiter look back puzzled and said in his typically mild and hushed manner, \"Sir, I am from Mexico City.\" We LOL'd. 

It's #2 on my list of Indian restaurants in the Valley, which is pretty good. Since Tandoori Times is so close by it almost always wins out on a given night, over the past year or so. But the fact remains that JOTC is solidly #2. 

The food is good, by my Indian standards. Samosas: awesome. Chicken tikka masala: very good. I tried the bhindi masala once and that didn't turn out too well. A unique JOTC feature is that dishes are served in very cute, traditional-looking, brass or copper Indian pots. 

Little details like that lead me to say that the decor and atmosphere here probably beat out Tandoori Times and every other Indian place. Simple but elegant, with old Indian art on the walls and cool room dividers thoughtfully placed throughout. The outdoor seating is very pleasant, with heaters to warm you up during winter. The location only adds to the reason to eat here. It's in a cool space next to the Scottsdale Civic Center, a few yards away from AZ 88. It's a solid place to come with a group to eat, drink, and enjoy some good conversation.

JOTC doesn't blow me away (thus only 4 stars), but it needs to be said that if you live in the Valley it is worth at least one visit if you like Indian food, which you wouldn't be able to tell from the other reviews. Judge for yourself."}
{"text":"We had a delightful lunch at Jewel of the Crown on a Saturday afternoon. The November weather was perfect and we were able to sit outside, listening to the next restaurant's live entertainment. 

We ordered off the dinner menu rather than get lunch specials. The tandoori chicken was very good and had a nice kick to it. Likewise for the chicken tikka masala, a generous portion with lots of wonderful creamy sauce. It was also spicier than I have had in the past but was excellent. The only disappointment was the naan bread, which was nothing special. 

If I were in town again I would absolutely go again to try some of my other Indian favorites. 

The hours are unusual so make sure they are open before you go."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times for dinner and lunch and it never lets me down.  The Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Saag are my favorite dishes and some of the best Indian food in Phoenix.  I just wish they had more options for lunch specials!  Some people would say the dinner is a bit overpriced, but it feels you up and the flavors are worth it.  I will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"I'm not real experienced in the field of indian food, but wow I left here happy!! I am a vegetarian and was always unsure if I'd really like indian food that much to go out and get it since it can be expensive, but I gave it a try and I'm glad I did.
My mom and I went here for lunch after the Scottsdale arts festival and no one else was there when we got there! As we were eating more people showed up though. They had some lunch specials that were reasonably priced so I decided to do that! I got a vegetarian sampler type thing for $11, my mom got a vegetarian curry and we shared. Our server did great, was attentive and served us well! I don't even know exactly what I got but dang everything was delicious! Was worried I wouldn't like some of it, but everything was excellent, paneer with spinach, lentils, vegetable curry, some kind of yogurt type sauce, rice, and naan. Everything was delicious! The naan was a little crispy and idk if it's supposed to be like that, but I enjoyed it. My mom loved hers too. Mine also came with a dessert and I wasn't too into it, but I just don't really like desserts like that. Was cool to try something new though. Glad I came here!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food not great.  Came in on a Saturday night, was craving Indian.  Not busy at all.  (Never a great sign).  The samosas were the best in town, piping hot with a great filling that was redolent of spicies and not super mild like some other restaurants.  The lamb korma and chicken tikka masala were okay.  For some reason it didn't pop for me.  It had nothing to do with the spiciness level, it was just missing that extra pop you get from a truly great curry.  I don't know if the spices hadn't been freshly toasted, or if it was lacking a crucial pinch of love that day, but I wasn't feeling it.  I left full but not quite satiated of my Indian food fix.  And the quest for the best chicken tikka masala in town continues....(oh I should mention the interior of the restaurant is beautiful, the service good, but the prices a little steep for my taste)"}
{"text":"I travel often to Scottsdale for business, and I always make it a point to come here.  The lamb korma is great, the chicken masala great as well.  Service can be a little slow at times.  All in all, wonderful Indian food!"}
{"text":"Went here on Valentine's Day 2009. Best Indian food i've had anywhere in Phoenix to date. Great atmosphere, great service, and outstanding food. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I come to this restaurant probably every 6 months or so. Not because I wouldn't want to come more, but because it's what I consider to be a \"special occasion\" restaurant. We come when family is visiting from out of town and we want to make an evening out of dinner. We're always craving some really delicious-hit the spot-comfort food when we all get together, and this place is just that. Every single dish I've tried here has surpassed my expectations of Indian food in America. I've visited India on a number of occasions now, and having had many home cooked meals in the mother land, I can say I've got a pretty solid grasp on what great Indian food tastes like. The ambiance is also really beautiful and inviting. It's a great place to gather, pour some wine, and enjoy authentic India cuisine."}
{"text":"So delicious! Parking can be a challenge. Park north of here in public parking ... never had a problem. Order the alu tikki for an app. So incredible. Leaves a bit of heat on the lips but just the right amount. Comes with 3 ... very filling and could be it for dinner for light eaters."}
{"text":"We just love this place.  They have the sweetest little patio that overlooks the civic plaza lawn so it's nice and quiet and not on a road.  I've never ordered the same thing twice and I've always loved everything- that's saying a lot!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Made reservations for NY's eve, seated immediately. Service excellent. Food delicious. Lamb perfectly prepared. Enjoyed Daal soup & Naan. Several children with families present, welcomed. Had \"dinner for 2\", required \"go boxes\" so much food. Delightful people, food, and decor. Would definitely go back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday night (8/9/13) because we purchased a Groupon. 
Now, I am NOT one of those people who, by default, think that all Indian food in the valley is horrible because it does not compare to my Mom's cooking. 
I am judging this place based on other Indian restaurants in the valley and the quality of food. 
Quantity of food - Really good. 
Ambience - Very nice. The decor is nice and pretty. I liked it. 
Service - decent.
Taste of food - It was really bad. I am sorry to say it was boderline inedible. We ordered the chicken tikka masala, 2 plain naans and chicken biriyani. The chicken tikka masala was too \"tomato-y\". All I could taste was an overpowering tanginess from the tomato paste and it wasnt pleasant. The chicken wasnt soft and tender and flavorful either. The chicken biriyani was similarly tasteless. The rice in the biriyani was clumpy and overdone. You KNOW that is a cardinal sin while making biriyani....overdone rice!!! The naan wasnt like a naan at all but more like tandoori roti. 
My point in writing this is really to inform the owners. I think that, with a little bit of tweaking of the food, this place could be excellent!  But unless they do that, we are not going back again."}
{"text":"We had the best Tika Masala Chicken last night! I'm still in heaven.  My mouth was doing some kind of dance that I had to continually eat for about 20 min. non stop. And those who know me know I love to talk and eat, but this time around it was all about eating and nothing else.

I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good Indian food =)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian Restaurants I have ever tried in the Valley. Great location, service,  and food. They are pricey comparing to others but worth it. What is different about it is that they introduce the dessert in a nice way and provide variety.Would go again. The place and rest are nice and clean."}
{"text":"Excellent Tika Masala Chicken!  I would highly recommend this place for good Indian food. Nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Most certainly one of the best and premier Indian Indian restaurants in Phoenix, but arguably one of the best in the southwests.

Can't really identify anything we didn't like. Atmosphere is great. Lamb masala and fish tandoori was spectacular. Garlic naan, on point. But the vegetable samosas were the spotlight. Not too doughy, the vegetable filling was unique. And paired the side of channa chick peas- delish!! 

We will be back and probably be bringing friends with us to show them this hidden gem. And it is a little hidden, tucked into one of the plazas in old town. But if you are familiar: it's nestled in by the iconic AZ88. 

Spot on. Thumbs up all around."}
{"text":"If you're heading to a show at the Scottsdale Center For The Performing Arts, this is your best convenient bet for dinner (if you like Indian food).  It's average but can probably satisfy your curry craving."}
{"text":"I'll go back AND get the same dish!  Now, that's some serious business for me to say!  
Ordered the following:
Keema Samosa - eh....  I just have such specific fond memories of the samoosa's we'd get back home and I doubt I will ever find anywhere that will match them -too bad so sad-  :-(
Lamb Curry - lamb was delicate & sauce was just a touch spicy, delish!
Chicken Korma - chicken was so tender, very flavorful.
Alu Paratha (bread) - this was just okay to me, but it was great when I doused it with the sauces :-D

I thoroughly enjoyed it, everything was very flavorful and the smell of spices when you walk into the restaurant, OMG, so wonderful!!!
Do I think it's super authentic, no, if that's what you're looking for, keep hunting..."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and have been eating Indian food for over ten years. I've eaten at a lot of Indian restaurants in MD, IL, and DC and this one rates high on my list. My husband and I went with my sister who is not a vegetarian. We had the channa masala, matar paneer, garlic naan, and puri. My sister ordered the mixed kabobs. We loved our dishes. They were flavored perfectly. The breads were just ok. We are used to garlic naan that is more fluffy and buttery. This naan was pretty thin and did not have the butter glistening on it. The puri was not very flavorful. The breads were not bad, just not the greatest. Next time I will try the bhatura. My sister liked her dish a lot. Her dish consisted of lamb, chicken, fish, and shrimp all prepared with different spices. The presentation was pretty cool. 
The service was great from the time we walked in the door. The place wasn't crowded when we went. There were two people waiting tables and they were both pleasant and attentive to their customers. Decor is very nice. There are some wires on the ceiling that they could cover up, but that does not take away from the ambiance. My sister was bothered that there was some spilled rice on the floor that no one felt the need to clean up. There was no one dining near that table so for me it was not a deal breaker. I highly recommend this restaurant. You will enjoy the food, decor, staff, and don't forget to take a stroll around the grounds outside of the restaurant... very nice."}
{"text":"I had dinner here two nights ago. It was great--every dish had its own distinctive flavor. My favorites were the samosa and kulfi. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Thanks Groupon and yelp for introducing me to this place. I probably wouldn't have tried it if there hadn't been a Groupon, and probably wouldn't have bought the Groupon without reading the good reviews on Yelp. This place is pretty hidden so you most likely wouldn't find it unless you were looking specifically for it. I love Indian food, though there aren't a whole lot of options for it in the area, especially in Old Town. The first time I went there was an office Christmas party going on so we went and got some beers at OTT first and then came back and even though they were still pretty busy they were accommodating. Both times we got the kabobs as an appetizer and split the Chicken Tikka Masala and both were really good. One entree is enough for two people to split for sure. The garlic naan is also the bomb and last time we were there we got some mango ice cream for dessert and it was really good. Haven't been disappointed by anything there thus far. They have a patio and an inside area which is cool because I love patios and I also like options. If you want to get in and get out go around 6pm otherwise it will get pretty crowded. Also, they give you some stuff to munch on when you first sit down, which is always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"The staff are well trained and knowledgeable. They knew what was and wasn't vegan, or what could be made vegan, on the menu and helped us order. That might sound like a no-brainer, but so many restaurants (even supposedly veg friendly ones) don't train their staff this well. Great flavor. Good spice. We ordered the Veggie samosa appetizer, Aloo Gobi, Vegetable Korma without cream, and Roti without butter. We will probably repeat that exact same order next time."}
{"text":"I have many things to say about this place.  I'm not even going to mention the Groupon issue I had today. I'm not gonna.  

a) what kind of Indian restaurant charges for naan?  come on.
b) I 'thought' they were honoring my Groupon (WHICH I'm not going to mention) so I got an appetizer.  I ordered the Jewel Kebab.  The lamb was great actually; however the chicken came out on bones.  huh? I had a drumstick and a thigh. That's not a kebab. That is, well, chicken legs and thighs.  Weird 
c) So they bring out my entrée:  lamb curry.   About 4 pounds of rice and a huge tureen of curry, so I thought.  The curry was in a silver tureen/warming pot and I was thinking \"Wow that's a lot of food\".  No, it was a shallow pan and everything below it was the heating element.  While I don't need a week's worth of food for my entrée, I do have to say that there were maybe 4-5 chunks of lamb and the rest was the broth. So basically I had soup.  

They didn't honor my Groupon (which, again, I'm not even going to mention)  so my lunch came out to $23.  WAs the quality of my lunch worth $23?  No.  It was certainly edible and I did in fact eat it, but the weird kebabs and the lack of lamb in my entrée was in no way worth what I accidentally spent.

There are far better Indian places."}
{"text":"Great experience I've always loved indian cuisine for it's bold seasoning and rustic plates Jewel of the Crown delivered on both those ends. Every dish was well made and seasoned, the lamb was tender and the chicken was still juicy. Garlic naan was the best! Only reason I did four instead of five stars is the service took a lil longer than I expected for my large party. I would definitely go back though."}
{"text":"I live in Old Town so getting Indian food that I enjoyed meant going to Tempe or Chandler....Thanks for fellow yelpers, I checked it out on a Sunday...the service was great until it got busy.  Quick to realize that the two servers on the floor were not only the servers but also the host/hostess and bartenders.  It didnt matter because the food was great...I am no connoisseur of Indian cuisine but haven had dined well over 3 dozen times at Indian establishments, this place did just fine.  The location is not ideal since you are forced to park in a parking garage although AZ88 is right there for drinks after.  The decor was in my opinion a fair attempt to an authentic Indian restaurant.  We ordered nothing outside of the basic chicken curry, naan, saag paneer, rice pudding (best I have ever had), mango lassi (not very cold or thick but good), and the galub jamun (which tasted like it had been frozen and thawed....only thing I didnt like)  Overall, I really enjoyed it and will be back when the craving for stuffing myself on Indian food revisits me."}
{"text":"An absolute hidden jewel. This is the best Indian food place I have ever been. The Chicken Masala is absolutely amazing and legit. The chicken curry is excellent as well. You will not find Indian food this good on this side of the world. Everyone I've taken here has been highly impressed and I know you will be as well."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and the food has been excellent both times.  

The chicken curry I had there for lunch today was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The rice and naan it was served with were also good if unremarkable.  For some reason I decided to try the salted lassie today and salty is an understatement.  I LOVE salt and still only managed to make it through 1/3 of this drink so lassie drinkers beware.  I had the plain lassie the time before and it was good, if a bit foamy.

Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This was actually recommended to me by a friend from India who said this is the only place he felt was close to what he had from India. The owner has run this place for 30+ years. They have great lunch specials that are very filling. We ordered the chicken tandoori and jewel curry. The chicken had a nice kick to it and the curry was a flavorful vegetable curry."}
{"text":"We really wanted some indian food...so we went to Jewel of the Crown for take out.  It was Saturday night and there were about 20 people dining so we felt like at lease some people were eating there.

We ordered shish kabob...it ended up being dried up and spiced oddly...we could not stomach eating it.

The vegie korma was ok but had huge...not bite size vegies in it.  Like really large carrot pieces and like whole quarters of potato.

The Chicken tiki masala was pretty good the chicken was tender and the sauce was pretty nice.

The rice and nan were fine.  

I guess we were expecting something really great and it was so so...next time we will try a different place until we find an Indian place that is better:("}
{"text":"Love the lamb curry, palak paneer, daal curry, and mutter paneer here.  Atmosphere is perfect- beautiful decor, very inviting, and just a great escape.  I truly feel like I've gone on a mini-retreat every time I dine here (twice so far).  The sole reason I haven't been back is it can get pricey.  Food, while small in portion, is terrific.  Authentic?  Yes- you won't find beef in the menu!"}
{"text":"We went there after reading all the amazing reviews on Yelp.And Disappointed is what we were.Yet another Indian Restaurant that fails to deliver.It's at a beautiful location in Scottsdale Mall and the interiors are tastefully done but that's that.  

We started with Drinks followed by an endless wait of 30 minutes before our appetizers arrived.The place was pretty full and almost all the tables were waiting for food.I wondered what was going on in the Kitchen.There were no servers around except for the lady who was taking the orders.I did spot the illusive servers once or twice when they were coming with food for other tables but failed to draw their attention.

Our order was Chicken Ginger Kabob  which was just chicken coated with some ginger paste on a bed of stale onions.The chicken was cold and very dry.It had no flavor.The only relief was the chutneys tamarind and mint which they serve on table with Pappad.
Too hungry to complain we just wanted to get our hands on the Main which was Chicken korma and Rice.The korma did arrive at the table but it was a VEG korma.
The lady took that away leaving us with Rice as we waited another 15 minutes for the Chicken korma to arrive.When it finally did the Rice had become cold! 
The Chicken Korma (boneless pieces of meat cooked with onion, cream or yogurt, nuts and delicately spiced) was nothing of the sort.

Also be prepared to wait another 10 minutes for the Check.Meh... I have definitely experienced better."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for lunch occasionally since 2011 when I've been working in the area.   Nice decor inside, and nice outside in cooler weather.  I like their lunch selections, from the wraps to the sample platters (thaali)...I usually get the non-vegetarian thaali with chicken curry, chicken tandori, naan, etc.   Always fresh and flavorful.    Good beer selection."}
{"text":"We had a very nice meal here last night. The curries were pretty authentic and carried enough spice to make them very tasty. Unusual location but it wasn't hard to find. Good service, though we were only ones there when we finished at 8pm."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service. There was a mix up with our carry out order, but we were offered complementary drinks while we waited for the cook to make our food fresh. We were also given a nice little discount (we didn't ask!). The girl working there was super nice and accommodating. Also, the food was amazing! Very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This place has great Indian food!  Try the Saag Paneer, Vegetable Korma and Mango Laasi.  Great for groups or date night!"}
{"text":"After several years of abstinence from Indian food, I thought a visit to Jewel of the Crown would give me warm fuzzies all over. I was expecting a rush of passion that you get from food affairs, but instead of being overcome with flavor, comfort, and satiation my vegetarian meal left me feeling unsatisfied and underwhelmed. 

I will try not to repeat that word too many times in this review. However, my vegetarian meal was indeed underwhelming and I did not take the leftovers or bother ordering dessert.

Service was A+ but food averaged to a B- because the hearsay I have about the meat raises the grade. Meat was seasoned exceptionally. If you're a carnivore, I suggest you order mixed kabobs ($20) for a sample of lamb, seafood, chicken, etc. Kebabs were served vertically suspended over chutneys and yoghurt and their presentation was more appealing than anything else on the table.  

Yes, you heard right. A display of hanging meat looked better than anything on the table.

For me, flavor seemed to come from only the chutneys. One red, which was mild and tasted like tamarind; the other green and spicy with cilantro and other herbs my tongue couldn't recognize. In fact, chutney saved the meal. We ordered a third chutney, mango ($3 - not worth it), which isn't made in-house. It is overly sweet with chunks of candied fruit. Unimpressive. 

Samosa appetizer was served with a spoonful of chana. The breading was fried right and not too thick. Not spicy at all, so I slathered it in green chutney. 

Bharta Makni ($12) came in a hot pot with tea candle underneath and still simmering on arrival. The menu describes it as eggplant mixed with onion and tomatoes, but it was an unrecognizable pureed dish with mushy green peas mixed in. I could barely taste the spice so I slathered it in green chutney.

Vegetable curry was served chunky but with all starchy veggies and I quickly lost interest.

Unfortunately having an underwhelming meal leaves my mind to wander. I began annoyingly verbalizing comparisons to other restaurants. Minute details which I would usually ignore became bothersome: 
 
1.  Is this garlic naan? Really? Garlic?
2.  Where's the garlic? 
3.  Do you taste any garlic?
4.  Not worth $3. One, yes, but not three.
5.  This is the first indian restaurant where I haven't received a small plate of pappadum upon seating. 
6.  We have to pay for pappadum?
7.  Isn't naan suppose to be fluffy bread? 
8.  I remember naan being fluffy.
9.  This naan is flat on one side. It's like cracker texture. 
10. Where's the garlic?
11. I still don't taste garlic?
12. They don't even offer mints or licorice at the end. 
 
So, three out of five stars for Jewel of the Crown. 
Yes, I would go again, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"With our regular Indian place converted to buffet and my lunch companions refusing to go (don't tell them, but I would go anyway), it was time to find a new Indian spot for the work lunch rotation.  We were on a mission and I was trying to figure out whether Jewel would be added to the list of acceptable lunch haunts.  After managing a circuitous route to the top floor of a parking garage, we navigated a maze like structure of corridors to find the restaurant.  Travel time was starting to negate Jewel from the list.  The lunch menu was small, and we all ordered the thali meat combination.    After a modest wait time the food arrived in an array of metal containers and was delicious.  I hope we go back, but majority rules."}
{"text":"My favorite indian food restaurant. Vegetable korma is the best I've had in phoenix. Always good service and not busy. We usually go early for Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"A long time ago in a galaxy far....wait, wrong story. A long time ago a client of mine who happened to be from India said Jewel of the Crown had the best Indian food in the area. Two days later I went (being a huge fan of Indian food), ordered everything hot. It came out milder than your average buffet food. Overall I found it bland, the service was poor (he was new), and no I can't add hot sauce to my aloo gobi to make it hotter....bleck.

Last night I was in the area and decided to give it another shot, right? Ordered chicken tikki masala, malai kafta, and lamb biryani. The first two hot, and the rice dish medium. It came out with the entree's being mild, I mean not even a hint of heat, with the rice being a weak medium. Why?

Also, if I order $50 in food and then add a side order of naan, shouldn't it be a little more than half a pita worth? I mean really...normally you get a little basket of naan, hell, normally plain naan comes with the entree. I don't mind ordering it on the side but bring me more than two little bity pieces!

Hate leaving two star reviews but seeing as it's happened twice in the same fashion...I just can't see going back. There's too many other great Indian places (down in Tempe!)"}
{"text":"Very bad taste, half cooked gravy flavor, both dishes tasted the same, and bad service not to mention couldn't eat the food or pack it, and they didn't care we threw the food and we didn't like it. No credit courtesy at all. Never going back. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Overall, it was good, but not great! My husband enjoyed it more than me. Really quiet for Thur dinner... 
Only 4-5 tables full (mostly couples). Not greatest spot for kids cause of noise level...really quiet inside. Our son is kinda loud : p  
Service was good, but not excellent. 
Sauces ok.
Breads ok. 
Dishes ok.
Could have better sauces or better flavors.  
Nice romantic atmosphere-they dimmed the lights & with our toddler that wasn't a good thing. Better for couples. 
Dishes a little more than they are worth."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to in the valley.
It has great reviews from critics and some famous clientle that frequent the restaurant.
The location is great for an artsy-evening since it is right by the performing arts center and the modern art museum.
It is quiet and intimate, a great menu and food.
Each experience has been wonderful, both the food and the service."}
{"text":"There wasn't a large crowd - yet the service was awful.  The food was okay but I paid 15.00 for a miserable lunch.  I really can't remember the last time I sat in a restaurant for thirty minutes without food or water.  Never again - I don't plan to return - and would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Great helpful server!  Excellent food!!  Yum!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, not amazing. The location is great, in the Civic Center. But this place is WAY overpriced. Chicken dishes are $15, lamb dishes are $17, and they charge you for naan (and an order of naan comes with ONE piece of naan! We had to order two for two people). I come from a place that normally has higher prices than AZ and our Indian places were better, less expensive and always had free naan. If this weren't so much closer than other Indian places, I would say I wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent staff and service. Food was good, but waitress was puzzled when I asked for pickle."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant ever!  The Vegetarian dishes are my favorite (paneer masala, saag, Bharata). Love the Chicken Tikka Masala!  Onion Kulcha and Bhatura are delicious!!! Tandoori is just right amount of flavoring.  Best food ever!!!"}
{"text":"I'm at an impasse here. The service was jumpy in terms of friendliness. The food was good enough and I suppose it wasn't too much (say 10-17 dollars a plate), but it certainly wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Took a walk through the Scottsdale Arts Center area and was convinced by my girl to detour and dine at Jewel of the Crown.  I've seen this place over the years but have always walked right (into AZ88) instead of left.  Pleasantly surprised by this authentic looking and tasting Indian restaurant.  

Gabriel, our waiter, suggested the chicken masala.  We took his advice and ordered that along with the vegetable korma and a mulligatawny muglai soup.  We both enjoyed the tamarind and mint chutney sauces that arrived with the cracker like starter.  Gabriel explained to us that their mint chutney is made in house with cilantro, jalapeno, ginger, and oil... We both thought the meal was impressive and a nice change of flavor and pace.  Our entrees came with basmati rice as well.  We didn't get any of the naan this visit, but we will be back!

This place is a real diamond in the rough, or better yet, a \"jewel of the crown.\"  Been in business for 22 years - that's gotta tell you somethin'!"}
{"text":"I discovered this jewel while looking on the Internet for Indian food near my office and was very pleased.  While dinner can be a little pricey, lunch is extremely affordable.  I loved the Chicken Koorma and the Chicken Tikka Masala.  Naan was fresh baked and delicious and was great mixed with Saag Paneer.

I have introduced a  few friends to it now as well who love it too.  The service depends on who your waiter is.  I have had good service and poor service but will keep returning for the food."}
{"text":"Tuesday lunch closed? How about updating Yelp's hours?

Walked 3 blocks to get here. Yelp says OPEN right now."}
{"text":"Do you know what's worse than being hangry (sic) and having your mouth all ready for something only to find out you cannot have that something? Nothing. Nothing is worse than that! Unfortunately, this is exactly what just happened to me.  

I have been to many Indian restaurants and all have been very accommodating with vegan requests, even if they were not a vegetarian restaurant. Nonetheless, I called ahead of time and spoke with a man who assured me that they could make vegan Aloo Saag for me. So I rushed over, happy to finally get to try this place out for myself. I could practically taste the spices, I was so excited!

When I arrived, the place was empty, except for me and 2 waiters.  I was promptly greeted and seated by server #1. Water came quickly and the second waiter took my order. I requested Aloo Saag made vegan with a hot spice level. Waiter #2 wasn't sure if they could make Aloo Saag since it wasn't on the menu. I didn't mention that I had already received an answer; I patiently let him do his thing. He returned and confirmed they could do this. I thanked him and went to wash my hands for my meal. I was so hungry, I could still taste it!

When I returned to my table, waiter #2 came over and told me that they could not make my Aloo Saag without the yogurt. Surely, he was mistaken. He said the kitchen told him that it was pre-made so there was no way to make a vegan version. Huh? I was befuddled. I asked to speak with the owner or manager. I was hoping the man from the phone (he had an Indian accent) would appear and set them all straight, but that man was nowhere to be found. Instead, waiter #1 came out and explained, again, that they pre-make the Saag now, so the yogurt is already mixed in... They cannot make a fresh, dairy-free batch, as other restaurants do and as I was told they could. So I left, hungry and pissed. I will not return. 

The good? Cute restaurant and waiter #1 was pleasant, professional, and apologetic."}
{"text":"We have eaten at JOTC many (MANY) times over many years, and it has always been excellent.  Because it is a little bit of a drive for us to get there, we repeatedly try other Indian restaurants around town, but we always come back to JOTC.  Why?  Glad you asked.

As others have noted, the restaurant is a nice place in a good location.  But it is the quality and consistency of the food that brings us back.  The chicken is always tender and not dried out.  The lamb is always meaty, not full of gristle like so many other Indian restaurants.  We love the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Chicken Tikka, the Lamb Saag.  And a cold Taj Mahal really goes well with it all.

As to the service, yes, it is sometimes a little slow.  Nothing is perfect.

But the food is always first rate.   I don't know what these other reviewers expect (free naan??  where do you get that??), but we have eaten in Indian restaurants around the country, and JOTC stacks up against them all."}
{"text":"Had  dinner  there tonight. The food was adequate.  The service  was terrible. After being seated it took 15 minutes to get a waiter. 15 minutes to get a drink and then 40 min. to get our food and then 15 min. to get our check and they weren't busy! Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is a good North Indian restaurant.  Here are my thoughts, and a few notes:

1) I am of Asian Indian background, and am familiar with the cuisine
2) It is a perfect place to go to for dinner after a show at the Scottsdale Center For The Performing Arts (walk just across the way)
3) The restaurant does cater to what I would call as the mainstream \"Westernized\" taste and view of India.  If you are expecting something like what you had in India, you will be disappointed.  
4) The quality of the food is good, though it is a bit light in taste....note that I am of Indian background, and used to having more fire in my food.  My mother and wife were with me, and they both found the food to be prepared well.

As far as what we ordered, we ate three dishes:

Lamb Biryani
Bharta Makni (Eggplant and Tomato Curry)
Bindi Masala (Okra curry)

All of them were good.  They were a bit light in taste though."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant that I've ever been to. I've eaten Indian all over the US, including in Europe and it's still the best. Authentic, great ambience in the dining room and beautiful patio in the old town courtyard near the performing arts center. Food and Service is excellent and $ affordable. I've been going there for years, and highly recommend. We get the same thing every time: delicious Vegetable samosa, Lamb Korma, Paratha, garlic naan, Lamb saag with raita... all excellent!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for Indian food, the chicken Tika Masala is one of my favorites. The nan bread is awesome but the best thing is the desert, pistachio ice cream! Staff is friendly and the place is pretty welcoming."}
{"text":"I am came here with my friend and my other friend, the Groupon.  I have heard great things and some negative things about the place, but I am adventurous and wanted to give it a try.  I actually passed by the place on a Tour of Scottsdale event.  Its kind of in a hidden corner inside a plaza.  I think I would have noticed this place if it was actually facing the street.

When I enter the place, it made me feel a little bit like I when I visited New Delhi.  We came later in the night, but the energy level and care of service was excellent.  The food was pretty delicious as we ordered saag paneer, vegetable korma, garlic naan, and onion paratha.  Overall the food was solid quality and one of the better Indian restaurants I have been in Arizona so far."}
