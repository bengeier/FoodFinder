{"text":"This is my most favourite place to buy sushi, especially my favourite, SPICY CRAB! Yummmm! Anyways every time I go to Scarborough Town Centre. The only set back is the money. For 6 pieces of sushi, it comes to about 6$ which I think is a little too much so, i usually buy it at the end of the day sale."}
{"text":"I was really craving sushi one day so I decided to drop by. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the sushi despite being a food court/mall sushi place. I know the sushi is definitely fresh since they have an end of day sale everyday. I've only tried their spicy califronia rolls and I love it - the rice is thin with lots of crab meat and good flavour. Will definitely be dropping by more often!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review assuming this is the Mac Sushi inside the Scarborough Town Centre near the food court.   I am a vegetarian who loves spicy food and sushi, and I have to say, this place has my ALL TIME FAVOURITE sushi ever! I feel embarrassed when I tell people that the best sushi I have ever had is from a small stand in the Scarborough Town Centre but it's true!  I very highly recommend the \"spicy crunchy veggie\" roll to anyone who has a tolerance for spicy food (it is quite spicy!) I have had these rolls at Mac Sushi stands in other malls such as Yorkdale and Fairview, and I have to say that they still don't compare to the ones at this location! I think it's the way that this location prepares their spicy mayo... I would love to know their secret!  The only issue I have is price, as it ends up costing me $9 for 12 maki rolls, and many restaurants give you even more for the same price (yet I believe that this is actually slightly cheaper than the Mac Sushi in Yorkdale!). My suggestion is to wait for the end of day sale when they price the rolls down, generally after 5pm I believe.  I have not tried the Mac Sushi at the other end of the mall yet, but this one is amazing!! Definitely go out and give it a try! =]"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. The sushi didn't taste fresh, as if they made it days before, and it was covered in wasabi as there was no little plastic separation from the sushi and the ginger + wasabi. Their soy sauce also has a strong bitter taste even with the smallest amount. It tasted horrific. I went to complain but they said nothing can be done. I left furious as I realized I wasted my time and my money.  I came to this sushi place to satisfy my craving, but instead it killed my appetite. Sushi had been my favourite food, but I'm starting to question is as I have realized that there is a lot of places that make bad sushi.  Most people say that you only get what you pay, but the quality of my food was significantly less than what I paid. I paid almost $13 for a small container of sushi when I could have gone to a restaurant like Tatami Sushi or Sushi Legend.  Trust me, don't go to this place at all. I never recommend getting any kind of takeout sushi as it will never taste that good."}
{"text":"I don't eat seafood but I do like veggie rolls. I came by for their end of the day sale which seems a little gross, especially if you're getting seafood. However mine was fresh and cold. I got the spicy crunchy veggie rolls. I didn't find it very spicy but that's just my palette. I loved the crunchy bits on top but it can get a bit messy. It was cheaper because it was end of the day but I would definitely come back and pay the full price. It's nice to have a veggie roll that doesn't taste bland. A must try! This was the one by the Walmart which is less busy than the one by the food court"}
{"text":"This place is decent for mall sushi. I like eating here when i can get the end of day special. The food is pretty good. Keep in mind this is mall Sushi, so its not made fresh, and it has probably sat around for hours. Keeping that in mid it is pretty decent for what it is, and I think it might be an ok introduction for people who like the courage to go into a full on sushi bar in order to experience sushi at it's finest. It is definitely good for what it is. Even though that's probably like saying it's the worlds tallest midget."}
{"text":"Spicy Crunch Vegetable Rolls are my favourite, best sushi place I've been to though I haven't been to many aside from T&T which was gross.   Be sure to go in during End of Day which usually starts about 2-3 hours before closing, get a deal!"}
{"text":"I really like the sushi here. I have an allergy to shrimp and I really shouldn't be eating here because of it. However I always get the vegetarian one, which I love with the rice rolls (not sure of the name). Last time I had it I think I had a reaction. So I wont be going back, unfortunately. Still, its a 'must try'."}
