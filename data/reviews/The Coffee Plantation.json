{"text":"Many Coffee Plantations seem to have closed, and there is a very good reason for it. This one is large inside, but on a Sunday morning after going to Church, Butterfields across the parking lot was packed so we thought CP was a nice option for time purposes. The place was mostly empty with one worker behind the counter, keep in mind that most places this size would have a minimum of 6 employees working. CP does practically everything wrong in the restaurant business: employees who lack that \"welcome\" attitude, pricing, cleanliness (every one of the tables had some sort of residue making it hard to choose a spot to sit), the coffee was not very good and since it would have been $1 for a refil....OVERPRICED! I threw 90% of it away which is rare for a coffee addict like myself. I ordered a breakfast bagel which was very pricey and took forever to get made which was odd since the place was not busy. I do not know why I care so much about this review as this Coffee Plantation will most likely close because they do not know how to run a restaurant. Too bad, they once were the best coffee place I had ever been too, and this is coming from someone from Starbucks Country."}
{"text":"Love this place - very laid back, with great super-friendly customer service and personable employees.  I come for the coffee and space to work using the free wi-fi, and I also really pleased to find that the food is quite delicious."}
{"text":"I went with two friends to this Coffee Plantation on a Sunday morning wanting a breakfast sandwich.  There was only one person working and the line for ordering was ten people deep.  When I finally reached the order counter, the young man stepped aside to fill the orders that he had stacking up.  When he finally came back to the line which was still long behind me, I ordered my sandwich and coffee.  I received the wonderful coffee, but it was 45 minutes before the sandwich was ready and it was cold, cold as tho it had just come out of the fridge.  I won't go back unless Coffee Plantation can afford to staff the place so service is acceptable."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood coffee place!  Awesome location with lots of chairs and couches to just hang around.  The owner works hard and employees are all super friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great coffee, great food & great atmosphere! Cord is my favorite barista, always greets me with a smile & makes sure my drinks are dairy free! Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Great place to study! The seating is so comfortable and I swear it's been a good luck charm. Many hours spent in here studying for tests or socializing; best ambiance of any coffee shop in Scottsdale. Check it out."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to read and work on a project. Great wifi, relaxed atmosphere, music upbeat but not invasive, comfy seating (inside, outside, couches, chairs). Have only tried their hot vanilla latte, but have had it several times because it is delicious. There is also chess and backgammon for the game inclined.

Basically now my favorite work spot. No more Starbucks for me! :-)"}
{"text":"This is ridiculous. Probably the busiest Coffee Plantation in all of Phoenix Metro, one girl taking orders and preparing food and drinks... very poor service but not her fault! Shame on management for understaffing. Only go here if you have the luxury of wasting time."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see that there is still a Coffee Plantation around! They have the best iced cafe mochas!!!"}
{"text":"Employees need to learn how to handle food.  Handled customer money three different times while making my sandwich. Stick with the beverages."}
{"text":"Cleanliness is not on their radar. Outside patio was filthy, server kept running his hand thru his hair."}
{"text":"As I was waiting the women working there were talking bad about customers.
Felt like I didn't matter at all."}
{"text":"I'll give this place one star for being able to sit outside, zero for anything else. The latte was burnt to undrinkable, the person making coffee ( not a barista) didn't want to be there at all."}
{"text":"Found a hair In my latte which was not mine... The guy remade my drink and it was fine afterwards but I've had some pretty bad service here on multiple occasions. I do think the space is very nice but because of the lack of attention to detail In their customer service .... And also how I didn't get a refund for that latte with the hair this place is a one star. I will say that when cord is working in the mornings my drink is always good. Will be finding a new coffee shop to study at."}
{"text":"It had been two years since visiting, and the things that have changed are not for the better.

There are cleanliness issues I'd never seen during any of my previous visits. The bottom of the pastry display case had debris, and there was dried batter and dust behind the crepe maker next to where prepared drinks are picked up. It was obvious these areas had not been cleaned recently. A big reason for the low rating is what appears to be unhygienic practices on the prep side of the counter.

Another negative was being treated as if we were a nuisance. The only person this happened with was a man who may have been the owner or manager. He waited on us at the register and made our drinks. When we approached, he appeared incredibly bored - eh, this happens, not a big deal. It got uncomfortable when he barely looked at us and didn't take the time to say anything when I asked what kind of chai they used. He responded with a general turn of his wrist to his left. I looked to my right, saw small shelves, scanned the items displayed, and found bags of chai available for sale. The interaction was off-putting from beginning to end.

On to the items we ordered... my mom said her cappuccino was very good tasting, my chai was bland and too sweet, and my dad's macaroon was dry and not fresh.

These are elements I'm glad have not changed:

The seating is plentiful - inside and outside. The main outside area is encircled by a metal fence - much appreciated since the coffee shop is on the strip mall's end corner where there's more car traffic. Inside many of the numerous tables are large enough to accommodate a group. Adequate size for playing a game or having a meeting.

The customer service I've received from the other baristas has been TOP NOTCH - always personable, warm, and eager to answer questions. The espresso drinks they made were good and hit the spot. Thank you for your genuine and thoughtful efforts!

This shop has its high and negative points. With many independently-owned & consistently high-quality coffee shops in Scottsdale, I will be frequenting them rather than stopping at this Coffee Plantation."}
{"text":"Every so often there's a place that I'll visit and not return to for years. It's a weird occurrence where you don't realize at the time but the place you're in somehow becomes a regular stomping ground. 

For the past several months I attend a writers meeting and our fluctuating group of three to eight or nine are well received and accommodated. The servers chat with us and if they aren't assisting a customer they're cleaning, refilling the complimentary water (+1 in my book) or doing something productive, rarely have I seen them just stand around. 

The Coffee Plantation is located at the end of the strip attached to the Gelato Spot and a Pita Jungle. In the past few years a lot of the shops' patrons were people from Gelato Spot needing a place to sit. Now the Coffee Plantations seats (inside and out) are filled with young adults sipping iced coffees, munching on croissants or sipping lazily on a whipped cream concoction. 

Like my group a lot of customers are there in groups doing homework, attending a study class, hanging out with friends or conducting business. Over half will have their laptops and are hooked into the free wifi. 

I would choose this place hands down over Starbucks... their coffee has a lighter flavor and slightly sweeter, their tea is always yummy, pricing is more reasonable & their baristas seem more genuine (sorry Starbucks but your people seemed to be trained to be a little too peppy. I just want my tea, not some tea and a shot of guarana).

A coffee joint wouldn't be my first choice of a hang out, but for meetups and meetings this place is great."}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for a different type of coffee shop, and stopped by the Coffee Plantation, after seeing it in a strip mall on Shea.  Large, lots of room, mostly business people when I arrived about 10 in the morning.  There was one person working the counter and being the barista, but it wasn't so busy that he couldn't keep up.  Not only was he efficient, but also very friendly.

I had a bagel with cream cheese, and coffee.  It was quite nice - gave me a chance to read my newspaper after golfing, and just relax.

It doesn't appear that they do any of their food preparation - so it isn't really a place to come to eat.  There are rolls, bagels, sandwiches, if you are hungry, but it is pretty basic.

It is different from some of the other coffee shops in the area, and they have free wi-fi, lots of outlets, and plenty of room. I haven't been there in the afternoon, but mornings are very pleasant. A nice option for coffee drinkers."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee places in scottsdale. I like their smooth and dark espresso roast. The atmosphere is quiet and casual. Excellent place for my meetings."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place... 
Day One: I came the first time because I was on a lunch break (temporary training in the area) and liked the interior immediately. The layout and decor made it a great place to put my stuff down and study for a while. 
I went to the counter to decide on my items, but the guy behind the counter was not helpful. I asked about a certain bagel,      \"Is that a plain bagel? Or a raisin?\" I couldn't tell because it looked like it had dark spots. \"It's plain.\" When I asked if we were looking at the same one he just stared at me waiting for my choice. I just decided to ignore his lack of service and order a coffee and the bagel. 
The coffee was mainly just syrup and the bagel was so salty I had to remove most of the top layer! Yuck. I threw my coffee away and half my bagel and left. 

Day Two:  Now if I had an experience like that, why did I go back? It was the only place right by my training that wasn't the gelato spot and where I didn't leave a tip! Plus, I loved the decor remember? So I went in and this time it was a different guy who was very helpful and got me what I needed quickly and was just very friendly. I didn't get coffee this time but I could relax, study my information and leave. 
So, I guess I would say on the right day this place had good food and friendly staff. And on that off day... Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I know this a long standing business in AZ! I'm all for supporting my local small business!! However I went in today and couldn't believe how dirty/dusty everything was, dust hanging from the awnings hanging over where coffee is brewed,shocked they haven't been fined! Hope they can improve that part! Until then..."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and it only gets better! LOVE: Hot Chocolate and the Chai Tea any which way. ALL TIME FAVORITE: White Mocha Mindfreezer. If food ever made me happy this would be it. Overlooking the sugar and caffeine this is the best drink of all time. People are awesome, hours are fantastic, service is always good and best thing is that all of those things are consistent. Go. Here. NOW."}
{"text":"Best white chocolate mocha I've tasted in a while...wish the morning energy was a bit more upbeat. Love to go back and try one of their pastries and maybe a lunch item. I'm hoping the register guy was just having a slow start to his morning. I'll be back for another go!"}
{"text":"Best Latte! Often start my day with their oatmeal and connect to wifi in peace :) Compy place to meet friends and catch up on life! 

The staff comes through with making you feel welcome. New to the area so glad my friends recommended Coffee Plantation!"}
{"text":"Thank you omar you did fantastic with my drink I'm so happy great service great expresso and not to mention i have made so many friends here thank you thank you TK"}
{"text":"The coffee was delicious but the sandwiches were pretty bland. I liked the barista with the blue hair because she seemed really attentive to my needs and she was able to answer my questions. The store was decently clean but the tables were a bit messy and sticky. All in all a nice, albeit overpriced cafe in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent ambience and the dirty vanilla chai latte is to die for. Don't miss out on getting the pesto chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place several times the last few months and had the opportunity to finally stop in yesterday for a quick business meeting.

The place has a comfy, living room feel with a nice amount of 2 and 4 seating arrangements spread throughout. When I was there about 3 PM it didn't have that early morning coffee house vibe and energy that perhaps a Starbucks has instead it was pretty chill. All throughout it seemed that everyone in there was busy on their laptops working and the place had a quiet library vibe. 

My first impression was that we had to have a very quiet meeting as the rest of the customers were busy with their heads down and in their own worlds. Since it was a bit a warm yesterday, I felt more like drinking a flavored iced tea then coffee so I ordered a large, iced green mango tea and my business partners followed suit with their iced drinks. The girl behind the counter quickly produced the iced teas in less then a few minutes.

After choosing a table that seats four people I looked closer at the surroundings and noticed a couple of things. As I pulled the chair out to sit down I noticed that under the table were pieces of lettuce stuck to the floor and some other food items I didn't recognize.

I casually sat down conscious of where the lettuce was and put my drink down on a sticky spot on the table that had sugar sprinkles on it. By the look of things, our table had not been wiped down nor swept under.

As I perused the other open tables around me and the surroundings, I saw the same consistent thing...tables needing to be tidied up and the floor needing to be swept, windows that needed wiping down and dust on the cafe furniture equipment. It just didn't feel like a clean place.

As far as the iced tea, my tea was fresh, not too much ice, lots of tea and it was served cold. What was nice was that you could actually taste the mango flavoring in the tea. It was nothing special but it did the job as I was thirsty.

Overall, the counter girl was okay, I saw nobody cleaning up and tidying about, the tea just basic.

As far as returning it's in a convenient and happening location and it would be good if they could improve the cleanliness of the place as it's an eating establishment and cleanliness should be a priority and top concern."}
{"text":"Stopped in because a good friend told me it was a great place...
Tried the frozen caramel drink- yum!!!
Chocolate macaroon- which they teased me about it being my breakfast ;) - mmmm!
I even got compliments on my top! 
Great start to my morning! Thanks coffee plantation!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Coffee Plantation for years now and I have always left happy. There is always plenty of seating and many outlets when I come in to do homework. During finals I especially LOVE coming here because they are open late!!! Cord is one of my favorite baristas because he is always friendly and knows my \"usual\" drink and snack. The drinks are great, the food is great, and the customer service is great!!"}
{"text":"This is my 4 th time here and love this place to study. Great relaxing place with decent snacks . Customer service is great but need slight improvements."}
{"text":"Coffee and food is just okay. Service was lackluster.. Customer service soft skills training and basic manners missing.. usually smaller coffee chains have friendlier and more attentive service than places like Starbucks or Coffee Bean, but not in this case. They treated my sweet mother like crap  Next time we'll wait to eat at Butterfield's!"}
{"text":"Why I decided to check this place out?

1. They're pet-friendly. Always a plus 
2. They're open later than most coffee joints in Scottsdale. Double plus 

super friendly barista & a home-y vibe... :)"}
{"text":"Wow -- finally, I've found a coffee shop in Scottsdale with more than 4 tables. Seriously.I haven't been able to find anyplace within a half-hour of my apartment that has:

1. Enough tables
2. Decent-ish coffee
3. An absence of blasting rock music

And now I found this place. Even better? Free Internet access. Why don't more place in this town have it?
So, yeah, I know CP is a chain. I know the coffee isn't fabulous. I know it's in a strip mall. Sure, compared to coffeehouses in college towns, it would suck. But, for Scottsdale, it wasn't bad!  And the cappuccinos were pretty good. Also, I know other posters have complained about a loud, high-school crowd here. But, at least on a Sunday, I didn't experience that."}
{"text":"Their food is overpriced for what it is, but the coffee is SO GREAT. Probably one of the best perks of this location too is that you can take your drink into the Harkins Theatre that's next door. 

This location also has a massive amount of inside as well as outside seating and it is also very easy to find a spot next to an outlet plug for your computer."}
{"text":"Was here today for the first time and love it! Great ambiance and great coffee!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Scottsdale I have to hit up my favorite coffee spot! The coffee is great and a wonderful break from Starbucks. The breakfast wraps and pastries are delicious as well! 
Be it morning or night I always receive great customer service which is an added bonus."}
{"text":"Great place!! Recommend. Good prices, clean,amazing coffee.
Nice seating area outside. Lot's of choices for breakfast i'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My all time favorite coffee shop! I live 45 minutes from this place now, so I don't get there as often as I would like. The flavors are much better than Starbucks by far! If you have never been to this place, it is definitely a 'must try'. If you like frappuccino's, try the mindfreezers :)"}
{"text":"Another crazy incident at this coffee shop and it might have been with the same dude who I had the previous debit card incident with. I was suffering through another bad date on one of the leather couches (oh please dust your coffee tables. .it is comically dirty) and we decided to thankfully leave the place. This woman could not be any whineyer or duller. Anyway..we parted ways and I took off walking around for an hour..but realized I had lost my keys and they probably fell out in the couch. Anyway..somebody had turned them in or the dude had found them and i was back in business luckily. I'm curious what will happen next time I return. Nice job though to get the keys back. Iced mocha not bad..but needed major stirring."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 5 stars because of the memories associated with it. I've been coming here with my Phx friends for as long as I can remember. When we were younger, we used to go here several nights a week before officially starting our nights out to catch up. My friends and I have gone through a lot together at this little coffee place. I've even met boyfriends, gained friends, lost friends, and caught up with a lot of old friends that I miss dearly. Even though it's super sugary, I usually order the peach italian soda, which is super good and simple. 
Is it an amazing coffee shop? Definitely not. But it's a nice place to relax at, especially in a city like Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great ambiance for studying, there is tons of room and wall plugs which is amazing.  The sandwich I ordered was disgusting though.  I couldn't believe how bad it was.  The menu said it was going to be on sourdough and it was on what tasted like cardboard with seeds.  I could've made a better sandwich at home for free!  The coffee was delicious though!  If I come back I won't be ordering food."}
{"text":"This is really a 3.5 in my book! 

The space is pretty big and they have both indoor and outdoor seating. They have free wifi and on a Saturday morning it is very quiet and a great place to work. 

The morning torque protein shake... Seriously one of the most delicious things ever. If I got to drink one of these every time I worked out, I think I would work out way more.

The Cali wrap for breakfast was pretty standard. There was a lot of wrap compared to inside goodies."}
{"text":"So for me, just drinking espresso over ice with a touch of cream is pretty basic, and CP does a solid job at serving a good espresso.

I like when even though their not Starbucks, the barrista tried to make my fiancee  an equivalent of an iced mocha fufu thing.  I'll give him an A for effort  and probably a B+ for taste but it was nice to hear someone have some passion that you'll get something good.

Enjoyed the ambiance which is spacious and the music in the background ( 80's to 90's ) provided good background noise so it wasn't a library.  

I'd support CP since their an independent business competing against a few corporate giants in the field.  And the fact they have good coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee + love the Chai, this branch at shea & scottsdale rd is great, the atmosphere is just right & Omar runs the place is great with customer service!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but tables and countertops were dirty and garbage overflowing. Staff seemed uninterested and distracted.  Food pics better than the actual."}
{"text":"So many coffee shops in this area and I was so tired of Starbucks, Dunkin, etc... I hadn't been to a Plantation in a while. First off, the place was immaculate; super clean and organized. It was a busy Sunday and only 1 counter girl there. Jessica was AMAZING! Super friendly and complimentary. She answered my questions thoroughly and made suggestions on drinks that she likes, off the menu, which I LOVE! Her service was quick, the coffees were delicious, and I left with a smile and good feeling. I will DEFINITELY return to Coffee Plantation if I'm ever back on this side of town. Thank you for your great service and coffee Jessica!!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Nice venue, lots of seating.
Coffee tastes good. 
One problem - the smallest cup size for latter is 16 oz (I like mine 8 oz)."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite some time now and there's obviously a reason. The staff is friendly and they are always very quick with getting my order read to go. Or on the other hand when I'm not in a hurry it's the perfect place to sit and work on the go. It's an easy going, laid back environment that's just quiet enough to focus."}
{"text":"We come here every Tuesday, and it's fantastic!  The girl that works every week is super friendly, personable and efficient.  The atmosphere is also very welcoming and comfortable and not as unapproachable as some coffee shops. 

The only negative I'd say is that we did try going on a Monday, and the girl that was working was off putting.  She acted like getting us our coffee was a chore and she was doing us a favor.  She didn't seem welcoming as her back was to the door when we arrived.  Again, we usually go Tuesdays and never have a bad experience on those nights.  Overall, I definitely recommend this place.  Just maybe not on Mondays."}
{"text":"I am a regular on Saturday for the Chess Meetup. Love this place with the coolest baristas and comfy couch area. It has both indoor seats and outdoor patio sets with misters. Also great location next to a theater and other restaurants."}
{"text":"Four stars for Coffee Plantation.  I come here for the iced coffee, free wifi, and chill atmosphere.  They have plenty of outlets so I don't have to go racing home when my laptop battery is running low.  This is a great place to just enjoy a caffeinated beverage and get some work done."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places for coffee and breakfast snacks.   I go every Sunday to buy the church audio vis folks their caffeine for the day!   Corey is very conscientious and kind every time I visit there.   The drinks are always fresh whether Hot or Cold.   I'll continue to go here forever!"}
{"text":"Coffee is pretty good 

Service is (from what I am being told) normal for AZ 

But.... and that is a big butt.... the big brown chair just inside the door?   OMG!   THAT S.O.B should be a national treasure.    I could eat, sleep, read, and poop my life away in that amazing warm hug of furniture.      If that chair every goes away, I will never go back."}
{"text":"Love that they have numi tea and wifi! Don't love the parking lot so much. And prices are kind of steep. (4.50 for two small teas)"}
{"text":"I always feel a little weird entering an establisment with the word \"Plantation\" in the name but Dave said the coffee here is bigger and cheaper than most coffee spots so in I went.  

I'm sipping on the iced Americano I got from the joint right now.  Decent.  It's allllll good."}
{"text":"Coffee here is good, food is hit or miss. The supreme sandwich on a bagel is frivolous, the wraps are now so great. The person working the counter was very short, not sure if it was just a bad day but it left much to be desired. 
There was a couple packs of open cigarettes, a lighter and keys on food prep counter. 
The berry blowout smoothie is great. 

A good alternatives to Starbucks for coffee but I wouldn't have food here again"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am not a coffee drinker and I prefer to drink tea at home. I go to the Plantation with my husband who really likes their coffee. The one thing that will keep me away from this place is the smoking. We usually sit outside as do the other smokers as well as the people who like to hold loud conversations on their cell phones. To be clear, I don't have a beef with the service or their food and beverage. I actually find the staff quite pleasant. I hate cigarette smoke and discourteous cell phone users."}
{"text":"The tea is good but it's an absolutely filthy place. If you go, check out the canopy inside over the food and drink/register area. It's cute until you see the years of dirt and dust that have built up on it over the years..Now think about all the dust and dirt in your drinks and food. Yuk!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have experienced in a long time! Go down the street to Starbucks. I won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"I'd have to agree with Jane... but if you are going to the movies at the cineplex it's not a bad stop for a cup of coffee... but not worth going out of your way to grab a cup, far better places to go around town..."}
{"text":"A far cry from the day's on Mill Ave... but the \"Plantation Roast\" is solid.  Good service. Still kind of a local place."}
{"text":"FAST, AFFORDABLE, QUALITY, FRIENDLY, GREAT ENVIRONMENT. What more could you ask for? Nothing. I've been coming here for years. About a decade actually. I've seen employees and owners come and go but I've stayed. One employee, Cord, has worked there for about as long as I've been going. He's one of the reasons I keep going back. Great guy. Plus, they've always been more than accommodating towards my pets. Great music usually playing too!"}
{"text":"I will agree that there are large tables, free wifi and plenty of outlets to plug your computer in, but it's frankly not worth dealing with the rude teenagers who work behind the counter. Whoever does the hiring seems to hire the \"same type\" of employee. If you go there often you know what I'm talking about. That place has only one asset to it, and that's some guy with dark hair, who seems to be there all the time. It's not the owner. The place has really gone down hill, sadly. They need to upgrade their food. hire employees who have some common sense, and show some kind of appreciation to the regulars who are keeping their doors open."}
{"text":"I like it here at night. Usually a good vibe, good service, and good coffee. I came here in the day, and yikes! It was like night and day! I was rushed out with my coffee. It was a business crowd and less of a hang out. It was ok and what you would expect."}
{"text":"Stopped here as my attitude for coffee is ABS, or \"Anything But Starbucks\".  Especially if it's a local place.

Cool place inside and plenty of patio seating.  Service is fine, cappuccino was properly made.  Have to hunt a bit for plugs and I didn't see any outside, but otherwise this is a great coffee place to visit.  If I'm ever back to Scottsdale I'd come back to this place."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect when we stopped in while waiting for Butterfields.  It's a counter service semi kitchen production line. Very mom and pop feel, which can be good or bad.  It was fairly empty inside while was fine because we wanted to get in and it. The coffee and muffin we got were decent enough.  I don't know if I'll be back just because here wasn't a true wow factor in anyway. If you're going to be competing in the coffee Biz you might want to amp up some part of the operation and clean your grill ever now and then.

Also aren't plantations notoriously known for underpaying the workers in an effort to grow rich at the top. Not a very large history of positivity in the world of plantations."}
{"text":"Watch out for the junior high and early high school kids at this location.... it's right by the movie theater, which means they all hang out here before and after the movie. The coffee isn't especially bad...but it's not especially good either. Fine if you're in the area. If not, it's not worth a special stop."}
{"text":"A place that clearly has a following and which has entirely \"uped\" their game lately. New digital menu boards that boast their  coffee drinks (of all types!), smoothies, and even the freshly made food they offer. Customer service has done a 180 in the past couple of months and you can tell they want to help you and even see how you are doing. 
All-in-all, it is a wonderful place to catch up with old friends, or even just be with yourself over yummy food and drinks. Simple.
I like simple."}
{"text":"When I first came to town, I was stuck going here for my internet access.

I had to pay for a monthly subscription, but could use a wired connection.  I suppose it was worth it, but naturally free wifi is more enjoyable.  I am one of those people who appreciates free over inexpensive.  Many people do not value something if they didn't have to pay for it.  That's not me.

This place in Scottsdale was my first realization that I was living in a place that was a giant trophy wife farm.  As I was here doing internet things pretty frequently, I treated being a captive audience to the most inane and astonishingly moronic conversations of my life.  High school girls would come in here and babble about the most pointless things.  I had no idea that high school girls could talk for hours without finding a topic, but I see now that they can.

The coffee is alright, I guess.  It is no better or no worse than any of the chain coffee places staffed by untrained teenagers."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is A-Ok, just as the 3 stars indicate.  The drinks are pretty good, the food is ok, the seating is ok and the service is ok (it's like Cheers - everyone knows your name but the service isn't really zippy).

I used to stop here often, but it had been a while. They've gotten a lot of new tables and chairs which makes it a lot less divey than it used to be.

Overall, a nice place to to grab a drink and relax."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for seven years to work, relax, play chess, and drink the sublime mango iced green tea. The vibe is relaxed and friendly, and the layout of the shop is conducive both to work and to meet with friends. The patio area is perfect on a nice day! I also recommend the scones and cookies. Great place!"}
{"text":"Noticed dirty dishes being dropped off at the same counter where the food waits for pickup! Gross! Then as I watched, some guy dropped off money at the same counter. Maybe a tip or something? Don't know but smells like it could use some fresh air in there, and again, please don't use the same counter for fresh food and dirty dishes!"}
{"text":"Been here many times...would have given them three stars before..with there new remodel ..they get 4.5...always great drinks and personable service..now very nice ambiance"}
{"text":"Love the staff here. They know my father and I very well as we are regulars on the weekends. 
They give you a really good portion of coffee when you buy it, it doesn't take long to get it, and the selections for flavoring (sugar, cream, cinnamon, etc) are better than Starbucks. I love it. The best part about it is for the most part it's very peaceful, so I am able to get a lot of work I need to get done, done. :) I wouldn't go on Saturday nights or Late Sunday afternoons. It gets very busy. But, of course, if you don't mind crowds, then go anytime! Again, I love the staff there. Chill and mild-mannered. 
Kind of pricy on the baked goods, but all prices are worth it. This is my main spot!"}
{"text":"One of the most mediocre / bland restaurants I have ever had the displeasure of dining at. My friend and I immediately regretted our decision to eat there."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop with a cozy atmosphere. Great selection of coffee, teas, juices, and kombucha. Comfortable outside seating as well."}
{"text":"Been coming here for-e-ver! Staff has changed over the years, baked goods have switched out good and not as good, but with the recent remodel and the lastest baked good selection, I think they have it down. We're regulars on our 25 mile bike ride here, so they know our needs and sometimes even have them ready before we sit down, so check it out, you will LOVE their coffee drinks. Sometimes it gets a bit noisy inside but now that the weather is cooling off, the outside patio is really nice to hang out at. Only recommendation for them is get new inside chairs! The rattan ones have seen better days! ;) LOL!"}
{"text":"Meh, ok coffee shop, with ads on sidewalk to order their new crepes. OK, but you can't order crepes after 2 pm??!! Then why advertising this after two pm? Moreover, crepe is not a breakfast item in any other shop and you can order it anytime of the day."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and the service is absolutely amazing. Julia helped me today and she went above and beyond the service standards. My food and drinks are always made properly. If you're in the area this is the spot to go to."}
{"text":"This place has made some great changes under new ownership.  I really enjoy relaxing here and enjoying my favorite coffee or tea beverage while I use the free wifi.  It's always clean and pretty quite, and the staff members who have helped me have always been very nice.  I see one of the owners here regularly and he is a great guy - ask for Omar.  They have really increased their food options, as well, and I like their sandwiches.  What more can I say?  I dig this place."}
{"text":"If your searching for coffee and don't want the typical Starbucks, then you've found your new home. 

They actually cater parties as well. There food is decent. They have a wide selection from desserts to actual meals. They catered my birthday party, and were very accommodating to me and my time. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the food, and were quite impressed it was from Coffee Plantation! Nice work guys. Not only do they have great service, but it is a place for memories, studying, and seeing familiar faces. It's a definite go-to coffee shop."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite coffee shops. Plenty of space inside and out, great drinks, friendly staff, comfy seats, and I would occasionally see people playing board games here. Another big plus is that it's open till late. I haven't tried their food yet but there are plenty of options."}
{"text":"Some things I really like about The Coffee Plantation:
- They have very tasty coffee, and good specialty coffee drinks.  I have had regular coffee (nice and strong), and an iced mocha (very large, good amount of chocolate, very yummy).
- Their food is better than I would expect from a coffee joint.  I have had a bagel, a bagel sandwich and a chicken sandwich, all of which have been pretty good.  (Admittedly, the bagel is served with packets of cream cheese which- although, just a presentation thing- reminds me that I could've had one at home for cheaper ha ha)
- Their atmosphere is great.  This part of town is lacking good local coffee places to go and hang out at.  The Coffee Plantation is spacious, has lots of seating inside and out, and comfortable seating at that.
- The prices aren't too bad. If you get coffee and a food, expect to pay in the neighborhood of $7-12, depending on the type/size of coffee and food item.

Thus far, I haven't had a truly bad experience to touch on.  That being said, as the other reviews indicate, from time to time others have had bad experiences (slow service, issues with wifi, etc.)  

Something to keep in mind: the wifi password changes (I think daily), so make sure to ask. I saw in the reviews where at least one person was heckled for not buying enough items to use the wifi...I've purchased only coffee and had no issues from the staff for using the wifi and sitting around for a few hours

*Short version:  The Coffee Plantation is a great place to enjoy good coffee, relax, read and get some OK to good food.  Although I haven't had a bad experience yet, like anywhere, you may encounter some slow service or poor customer service.  That being said, my opinion is that these issues are uncommon!  I would very happily bring friends or guests here, and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Coffee Plantation has a good neighborhood coffee shop feel to it. That's hard to accomplish at Scottsdale/Shea but they really nail it. Plenty of seating, with a variety of tables/chairs/couches, as well as games and outdoor seating, this is becoming my go-to coffee place. 

The coffee tastes very good, with a good amount of variety in their choices and flavors. I would definitely recommend. I like their later hours as well, though staying open until midnight on the weekends would be even more ideal."}
{"text":"Went in to buy coffee and use internet. The snot nosed child behind the counter informed me that they were closing in 20 minutes, mind you it was 940pm. I informed her that the website yelp.com indicated that the hours of operation were till 10:30p and she might want to have someone update that. She said :\"I have no control over that.\"and went on about her business.  We specifically went to this place to drink coffee and use the wifi and I figured that helping them get IT right was the right thing to do so I said \"I'm sure the manager can update those hours, you know the manager right?\" she said \"Oh, do I?\" \"I don't know you work here. you know what? we're going to skip the coffee we don't like this rude attitude goodbye\" can't rate these asshole's coffee cause I didn't have any. Skipped the wifi too.  It gets better.  After I leave I call up and ask for the name of the manager. Its the child again. I am told that I am rude and condecending. Maybe, but I didn't ask for your opinion on the subject just the name of the manager. They say something unfriendly and Then a dial tone. Hung up on me.  I dont know about yall but next time I want  coffee I wont try to buy it from Cynthia."}
{"text":"I would've been totally satisfied with my \" to go\" mocha experience if my bank statement didn't reveal that I was charged an additional $3.00 above the price on my receipt.  WTF?!  I will not be returning here for my coffee fix!  I would recommend cash only if you choose to go."}
{"text":"I will never set foot in Coffee Plantation again. Today, as I was meeting with one of my students, I asked the barista for the wifi password (for her math homework.) we had just started-- she had already purchased a $5 beverage. From across the coffee shop, he shouted that I would need to buy something as well if I wanted to use wifi-- which is free. I usually buy a coffee wherever I am, but we had just started. 

When I didn't come over immediately to purchase a drink, he threatened me... Actually told me if I didn't come talk to him and buy a drink (I was only there to meet a student)  that he would call security. 

We were not loud, we had already purchased a drink, and simply asked for the wifi password. 

We promptly got up and exited-- I was shaking. Never have I been threatened by a barista at a coffee shop... And for what? Not also purchasing a coffee, since I was going to use the wifi? Thanks, coffee plantation, for actually helping me be a Starbucks fan. 

Customers, beware! If you get off on being hassled, this is the place for you! If you are accustomed to human decency, stay far, far, away."}
{"text":"Love the coffee here, but more importantly, the service is fast and friendly.  Have tried their oatmeal in the AM, and its good, you get a giant bowl, so be hungry.  I have also tried their latte and their mind freezes, which they can make with almond milk on request.  They are nowhere near our house, but we make the trip"}
{"text":"What's up with all the shouting and \"confusion\" ambiance? I understand it was the film festival and there were more clients, but still no need to rush you in to order when you are barely looking their menu.

I had a roasted pepper panini. The bread was tasty BUT who ever prepared has no clue how to cut a bread in HALF! that SIMPLE detail ruined the whole experience.

Coffee was good and strong, and all the chess players make you want to sit and play backgammon instead."}
{"text":"Try their mocha Mindfreezers - great taste and is mind-numbing. Love their ample patio space as well. Customer service is always cheery and full of sunshine. 

Bathroom was so dirty yesterday, however, that it looked similar to a gas station's. Blech! Not to be gross, but toilet needed to be \"bleached down\" and the door lock (it was a \"onesie\") needed to be fixed. I got caught w/my jeans around my ankles on the pot by a lady. I think she was more embarrased that I was! Also the bathroom sink was clogged."}
{"text":"It started off pretty good. Greeted, check out was easily. Place seemed pretty chill which is what I read on other reviews.  Lots of plugs, nice, music not too obtrusive. 
The reason why they got 2 stars? Very simple. The internet is slower than dial up. I did multiple speed tests and it took forever for anything to load. Of course the douche bag customer that doesn't seem to respect other people needs to put tweety bird on silent before I straight up throw the damn phone in the garbage. I have provided a picture of the speed test. No excuse for speed this slow. Especially when I pay 2 dollars for a water."}
{"text":"Iced white chocolate mocha was pretty good. Not the best ice had but the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to stop in and try this place for some time now and I just did!! It's very cozy and quaint, I got a iced Carmel machiatto and it's great!!! I also got the pb bliss cookie which was GOOD, BUUUUUUUUUT... not as good as mine!!! :) I definitely plan on coming back and trying a wrap and a sandwhich!!! And may be it's just me but it does seem a little warm... the barristas are very friendly and helpful! Oh ANNNNNND they still have the cream out, most places are getti g stingy with that!!! (:"}
{"text":"An excellent Americano with 6 shots and honey drink just now. Nice setting and seating areas. Quick made and a bottle of honey at ready position!! I like this place. Lots food options here for breakfast or otherwise. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Bad service, nasty food, uptight environment. Definitely not a coffee house vibe. They don't even have music playing. I won't be back!! I ordered the plantation sunrise and it tasted dry and fake. I could've done a better job at home. The two female workers also used a lot of profanity and weren't attentive to their customers. They just sat on the counters and ate their fruit bowls because apparently they were on some kind of diet. I stood at the counter for a while before I finally had to ask them over the counter for service. They both looked at each other and hesitated and then one put her food down to help me. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food! People are super friendly and I love how creative and accommodating the people are here!"}
{"text":"Lots of seating, good atmosphere, good coffee, unobtrusive music, and free internet for customers. Exactly as a coffeeshop should be."}
{"text":"This place needs a face lift.  There is no better way to thank your customers than to make your establishment a pleasant place to be.  Seats were disgusting, and it's at least been a few days since someone swept the floor."}
{"text":"Great local spot. Lot's of comfy chairs inside, huge patio area with smoking and non-smoking section"}
{"text":"Great coffee, tea, sandwiches and salads.

I enjoy coming here after watching a movie at the harkins theater in the same center.

It is a great place for a business meeting or to have a coffee/tea with a friend.

The environment is cozy with a couch area, bar area, and tables.   The temperature is always right on for me.  I also love the fact they have TVs so I can see the game or the news.

Sometimes I like to come here put on my headphones and hide away to do my business planning.

One thing that is hard to resist is sitting there while they make sandwiches.   It smells so good and the salads are amazing!

Now the best part is the Mocha Mind Freezer.  They are yummy and addicting! and unlike any frappacino or other blended drink out there."}
{"text":"This place is full of interesting people that is for sure. Often a cop hangout when I have been there. It is also full of teens on the weekends or poetry slam folks on certain nights.  The coffee is average. Good but not amazing. The staff from what I recall has been really nice every time I was there. A better hang out than a Starbucks, but I would avoid it on the weekends when it will be packed with a movie crowd."}
{"text":"Pros: 
Lots of seating - couches, large & small tables, a bar.   Outdoor seating too. Staff was pretty friendly.  Pastry was good. Oatmeal serving was huge for $2.99. Free wifi. Really friendly atmosphere.

Cons: 
Coffee wasn't great. Soymilk is sweetened. None of the sandwiches are vegetarian. 

Note: Chess club meets on Saturday afternoons and you can hang out all day."}
{"text":"Okay so that visit was a mess. 

Arrived 8:30 pm, and there was no one at the register. Stood there for 15 minutes. Several customers came and went as we waited. Finally, the lady comes out from the bathroom. She's apologetic, but asks first \"were a lot of people mad?\" I mean, I'm one of those people. Her eyes were tearing up-so I asked, are you okay? She responded that she was very ill. I inquired as to why she was working and she replied that she had to close up and no one would come in to cover. she then asked if I wanted a drink-which I did-but not if I knew she was ill. I don't know what ill she was, but I know she should not be prepping drinks for people. Her hand should not be plunging into ice machines and touching sweets. Finally, a backup employee came in at 9, but by then, the original workers sick was on everything. 

Always wanted to come here. Never coming back here."}
{"text":"Good coffee. Very large shop with lots of seating. I had a veggie bagel sandwich that was very good."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place is still around! I used to work around the corner from here (I'm talking about 10+ yrs ago), and stopped in every now and then. I don't know if there's other Coffee Plantation's still out there, but I remember the big one on Mill & the small one in Fashion Square that are no longer around. 

Anyway, I randomly found myself in this area, wanted coffee, and stopped in for old times sake. It still looks the same! There's a lot of comfy seating (the inside is really big), and from what I can tell they still do live music at certain times (weekends I'm guessing).

They're a little pricey compared to other coffee shops, and maybe this is because I'm being nostalgic, but honestly I thought the iced coffee was good...like REALLY good...like Dutch Bros level good (like I said, I might be letting nostalgia set in). I also has a chocolate scone that was delicious! 

I'm never in this area anymore, but I'm glad Coffee Plantation is still here. On the rare occasion I'm in the area again I'll happily stop back in!"}
{"text":"Coffee plantation is a nice laid back coffee shop. Good drinks, prices are average. The shop is unique and comfortable. Patio is smoker friendly but has non smoking patio area."}
{"text":"This one of me favorite place to relax, it is open till late. friendly service,"}
{"text":"The great thing about Coffee Plantation is just great people like Omar and Cord making your stay pleasant.  They prepare good coffee drinks as well as an egg bagel that's out of this world!  Their pastries - cranberry scone - is fantastic too. The Strawberry salad is amazing too!

But the real beauty of this place is it makes for a great meeting spot.  It tends to be quiet, unlike Starbucks, and there is almost always good seating somewhere. 

I've been coming here for 5 years, that's how much I love the environment and food."}
{"text":"The Coffee Plantation is my \"go-to\" place for coffee....I personally have never had anything less than great service, the coffee is fantastic, free wi-fi all day, plenty of seating inside and out as well as bar-style stools to post up, numerous electrical outlets to plug-in, full menu for lunch and breakfast plus a display of sweet treats!
No complaints here, I have spent many full days working from here and enjoyed them all, a nice change of pace from the home office."}
{"text":"Location is great. Drinks are good. Central place to meet people.  Breakfast sandwiches are good. Love all the open windows and views."}
{"text":"This place is very good for business meetings or hanging out with friends. They have really good breakfast menu as well as variety of coffee drinks. The location is very nice as well. The four stars is because it is not a bomb coffee place but definitely the ambience is."}
{"text":"Did the owner/manager seriously spit lougies in my burrito?!

I haven't been back here in years, but I'm updating my review because the experience haunts me. I was a fan some years back. I came regularly and enjoyed camping out with my laptop, sometimes I people watched but mostly I just got work done. I regularly bought more coffee/food so it's not like I was wasting space. Anyway, I really liked their breakfast burrito. I complimented them once or twice on the hot sauce they put in it. Subsequently one day they put too much in, so I complained. I wish I hadn't done that. But every visit thereafter there seemed to be something wrong. Something weird. Something gross. Like something rotten was put in it. It wasn't a strong taste, but it was definitely not normal, like the slime of week old lettuce. It was always just a bite or two, but it was noticeable, right in the middle of the burrito. Since the next bites tasted fine I tried to ignore it. One day maybe two years or so ago after I had moved further south and hadn't come so frequently I came back again and ordered the same. While my head was turned, my hunch that something was wrong was verified. One of the ladies was watching the owner/manager prepare my breakfast burrito and she gasped, loudly, like she just witnessed him spit a lougie into my food or something. He said to her, \"He says he likes the hot sauce and then he complains about too much hot sauce!!\" I didn't look. I heard the whole thing, though. And for some unknown reason, I ate it. The whole thing. And I tasted something wrong again. 

Never been back. :'("}
{"text":"If you're tired of Starbucks and looking for something new, hit up Coffee Plantation. If you're more concerned about better tasting coffee, I'd say go back to Starbucks.  The coffee here is just so-so. And they don't have as many fun options as well, Starbucks. Also, my beloved frappaccino is a 'mind freeze' here and it pales in comparison. 
As the review before mine stated, there are a ton of high school and junior high-ers here and boy are they annoying. I've tried to work at this location before and they're loud and distracting. But what can you expect? They're teenagers. 
Come during school hours- that's your best bet."}
{"text":"My go to study destination in Scottsdale! I love the layout/decor it is 100% set up for homework. I come here regularly to study and always get iced coffee. Their iced toddy is one of the best in town the flavor is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've tried Coffee Plantation twice. 

Both times I ordered a vanilla latte, and both times the espresso was extremely bitter. The first time, it was just bitter coffee taste + milk (no vanilla or sugar flavor whatsoever). The second time, it was bitter coffee taste + vanilla syrup + way too much sugar.  No consistency in recipes apparently, but consistency in the espresso sucking.

The guy last night was reasonably nice. The girl I had the first time was very short, impatient and seemed very unhappy to be there. 
Menu is hard to read - sure, handwritten chalkboards are cute, but this one is a jumble and is hung way up and far back. 

There is ample seating and it seems like a decent place to hang out. Unfortunately the coffee is so bad I wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"This place isn't a full menu restaurant like others in the same lot. The food was great and fresh.  The staff was very helpful with making a gluten free modification.  My husband got a breakfast wrap and didn't notice it came with hotsauce so it wasn't as enjoyable."}
{"text":"Really nice workers.  Sandwhiches and smoothies are fantastic.  Coffee is pretty good.  Very comfortable and relaxing enviroment."}
{"text":"I go to Coffee Plantation at least four times/week and it always feels like home.  Our family loves their coffee, tea and delicious food!  CP is one of the few true coffee houses in Scottsdale.  It's open late, has a loyal following and feels unlike the chains that are everywhere else."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and food. Anyone who is looking for a laid back coffee house. This is your place.  Staff is always friendly. Prices are fair. My friends and I have often made this meeting place for all sorts of occasions. My favorite is their iced mocha. Keep up the good work. Coffee plant is one of the many locations that makes Scottsdale great"}
{"text":"Great Place to have a study group, eat  a bagel and drink some coffee. Very convenient location with Wifi and very clean. I will be back the next few weeks with my laptop and business material."}
{"text":"Coffee is great! We take the dogs and enjoy the patio on Saturdays. Cory is very friendly and talks with us every time we go because we have a mutual love for dogs. I would recommend the hot caramel machiatto it is frothy and yummy!"}
{"text":"Extremely Spacious inside and outside (patio).  Great ambiance,  decent coffee and food.  Its the comfortable hangout ability that pushes the plantation to a 5 star rating for me.  This is a great place to get some work done during a meal or just to chill on your PC.  Its never too crowded from my experience (sometimes on a Saturday during the Chess groups).  I'm a fan of their Supreme for breakfast and their Turkey Club for lunch or dinner (hold the 3rd slice of bread).  Free WiFi with a purchase (you have to ask for the password - don't expect high speeds).  I recently found out that you can get a $1 refill on a regular coffee - nice to know."}
{"text":"I have gone to coffee plantation and it has the best coffee, tea and atmosphere. I get all my work done, never bothered and the staff is great. I do  not even like coffee that much, but if i ever get it its only from CP.  You can read the newspaper, play chess watch tv or just mingle with some regulars. In addition , i go there to chat with the manager Cord. He is respectful, extremely nice and does a great job running the place. There location is perfect and i look forward to going there whyenever i get the chance. I will not go any where else, especially Starbucks where the coffee is just plain bitter and over crowded. You have to fight to get a chair."}
{"text":"Coffee is good, service is good.  The food looks good too.  This has more of a relaxed feel than Starbucks and as pretty full at about 10:30 am.  There are regular tables and couches set up which make it easy to get to meet new people.  I saw several people introducing themselves to the person next to them, asking where they were from, etc.  This place is pretty cool in the fact that it has this friendly atmosphere.  Just a nice place to hang out, meet new people, bring your own group or just relax and read the paper or do some paperwork."}
{"text":"This is not a place for eating things. It's more like a basic lounge with emergency food and drinks only to be consumed in the event of imminent death due to starvation.

I don't mind hanging out here and ordering a tea in order to say, \"I respect the convenience of your establishment, here's two bucks so I can kick it for a while\", but literally every drink or food item I've tasted is slightly worse than the memory of a  brownie I ate on an airplane two years ago. 

All the food stuff comes from some external source, and the internal source of drinks does not give a single fack about you. They don't have a kitchen, and the staff is pretty much just teenage girls who wanna talk to each other about hooking up 'n stuff lyk that, ya know? Plus, I saw one of them sneeze on a sandwich, look around, and then pretend nothing happened. That kind of irks me, considering \"snot\" has yet to be listed as a condiment option.

If you expect nothing besides a good location for gathering friends, or using wi-fi, you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"Some of the baristas here are not the most customer service oriented.  But some of them are really wonderful....and their chai is beyond delicious! Chocolate coconut macaroons are to die for.  And its a great place for a meeting or a quiet place to study."}
{"text":"I like meeting clients here as there is a nice patio that is shaded outside. Inside there is plenty of seating. There is also a great variety of food that is delicious including gluten free cookies that taste great."}
{"text":"Great spot to spread out for a while with a big group. My family and I ordered coffee and breakfast munchies here on a Monday morning and spent a good several hour making our way through our coffee and a game of Phase 10. There was plenty of seating (a good 20 tables outside and inside each). Of course it being a Monday, it wasn't crowded, but I imagine any day of the week you'd be able to find a spot even with a group of friends. That's rare for a coffee shop. Food and drinks were above average, probably an 8 out of 10. The only downside is that on the main outdoor patio, smoking is allowed. There are some outdoor tables on the side that are reserved as non-smoking, but they are all small two-seaters. My family had to move indoors halfway through our game due to several people who chose to light up around us. For some this may not be a concern, but we certainly found this aspect unpleasant."}
{"text":"Do NOT bring your business here. Horrible customer service and horrible employees. I went here to get tutored today and was harasssed by an employee over the wifi password. I had bought a juice from them fifteen minutes earlier then asked for the passsword. The barista yelled at me off-handedly from across the store, demanding I buy more than the juice because I wanted to use their wifi. I ignored him, shocked by his rude bahvior. He then threatened to \"remove me\" from the store if I did not cooperate. I have no idea how they stay in business with an employee like that but I will NEVER be going back."}
{"text":"The only dependable cup of coffee in Scottsdale.

A pre-church ritual, Coffee Plantation not only offers good coffee and a serviceable breakfast and lunch menu, but the friendly counter staff also provides great service. 

Lots of conversation spaces and high-performing Wi-Fi makes the Plantation an ideal spot to hold meetings or book club and the convenient location near Scottsdale and Shea makes for a nice date stop before or after a movie or dinner."}
{"text":"Very good coffee here. My hubby loved the coffee and I loved their latte. I definitely noticed the extra frothy milk in the latte and it made a big difference. 5/5!
They start serving hot food starting at 9 am on the weekends so we couldn't try any food, but hopefully we can next time around."}
{"text":"Unless I am dying because of a lack of caffeine, I will never come here again. The place was so dirty and the two behind the register were talking trash about people. It literally took 7 minutes to make medium latte. The place is a cute hangout sport, but I don't see how they have not been closed due to health violations."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place as well as the location! I found the Baristas here to be very bubbly and welcoming. I generally like vegan goodies, but tonight I tried the vegan ginger cookie and wasn't the least bit impressed. Definitely tasted like it \"needed something\". Also wasn't thrilled with the cookies & cream mind freeze drink. The flavor was too intensely chocolate...more like mocha instead of cookies & cream. 

Will go again though because the menu is expansive enough to try something new & different on each visit. I've previously tried & loved their macaroons & was disappointed they didn't have any tonight."}
{"text":"Great place all around. Right behind Butterfields that usually has over an hour wait for breakfast. Why wait when you can get an awesome breakfast sandwich or crêpe here in less than 10 minutes!! It's a Big place that can accommodate big groups."}
{"text":"The coffee is good, better than Starbucks! The chocolate peanut butter smoothie is also very good! I may be a bit bias since I met the love of my life here, but the ambiance is great as well. Lots of seating and very spacious inside and out. Located in an interesting complex that also had a movie theater. Whenever we visit Phoenix, we always stop by here to remember how we met and reminisce. They also have gluten free desserts, not too many but usually a couple."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, so far: at the wee hour's of dawn and at 3 p.m. on a weekday.

This place is surprisingly hopping and happening mid-afternoon with a lot of one-on-one business meets, friend greets, and individuals working on laptops or reading while reclining on a comfy-looking sedan or sitting and staring at nothing.

 What impressed me was that you could host, say a job interview or other professional meeting here, and unless you're a really loud talker, you'd experience a sense of privacy. This place is large enough inside and out to accomplish all that.

The  coffee is really fine as I recall from my wee-hour's-of-dawn visit some time ago and the berry smoothie was outstanding and less than 5 bucks at my 3 p.m. visit. The service is casual, friendly, and hopping like the place itself.

It's located a half-block east of Shea Blvd. and Scottsdale Road. Check it out. I've made a mental note to frequent this place more often."}
