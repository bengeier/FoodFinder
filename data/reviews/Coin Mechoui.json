{"text":"Not sure what's going on here... I bought my parents a gift certificate, as I had enjoyed the food. They tried the use it and the owner would NOT HONOUR it. Very disappointed.  Bad business ethic, do not recommend."}
{"text":"Watch out, change of ownership last summer means that previously purchased gift certificates and fidelity cards are not being honored. :(  That being said, the new owners have done a decent job is staying relatively faithful to the old menu and recipes that loyal customers have loved over the years."}
{"text":"The place looks very dark on the outside and old on the inside but please let this not deter you!  The staff is very friendly and experienced. The food is really good!"}
{"text":"To noise and to high price for the food.  The place need some touch to make it completely nice. I felt stress to eat because the owner don't stop to push the employe to be fast and press on the costumer. I think the price of the plates are high because it's have a baily dancer, who don't know how to dance and maybe that's why the money help to pay the staff and the entertaining time. If you need a real. Traveling in Middle East don't go there it's not representative o what it should be...."}
{"text":"I was invited by friends to join them in this little restaurant and my! was I ever satisfied. It's located in a small plaza but in it you'll find a family run business with friendly service and fresh tasting Mediterranean food. The food was delicious and fresh and very healthy. I had the chicken breast which came with rice and salad. The chicken was grilled and the salad was crisp with nuts and raisins and fresh herbs, it was tremendous. Their hummus is great and their roasted potatoes and falafel are other great side orders to share! Oh and might I add- very affordable! Always a plus."}
