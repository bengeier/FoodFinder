{"text":"We took a friend's advice and ate here today.  Everything was great. My husband is very picky about his ribs and he was impressed. The meat was plentiful and done to perfection. He had the hottest sauce and loved it.  I had the brisket and a huge spinach salad and we  shared mac and cheese.  We thoroughly enjoyed it all. The staff was super friendly and efficient. The prices are very reasonable.  I highly recommend this eatery.  We ate here for the second time and this time we brought friends.  The ribs, brisket and Reuben were all excellent. Our friends were as impressed as we are and we agreed that we have to go back, again. We arrived a little after 6:00 on Saturday and were seated without a wait but the tables all seemed to be full when we were leaving.  The staff was friendly, efficient and accommodating .  This really is a great place for barbecue."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today. Great decor pleasent service. Had the brisket sandwich. It was excellent. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I was curious to see what restaurant would follow Del's.  Jabo's is a nice addition to the restaurants in the neighborhood.  The decor is welcoming and the service is friendly. I had the Smoque Stack with fries and my husband had the half rack ribs + half chicken with mac and cheese.  It didn't dissappoint, we will be back soon."}
{"text":"I live so near by, I have been hoping for months that whatever replaced Del's would be great. I needn't have worried--Jabo's is going to be a repeat favorite.   It's warm and cozy but well lit. All of the wait staff seemed to be chatting with the customers and making them feel welcome in the new establishment, but I can really only speak to our waiter, Nicole, who gave us loads of tips on what was what and offered sauce samples!   I got the quarter chicken and it was tender and flavorful with a delicious dipping sauce. The mac and cheese side was creamy and not overly rich. The bites I stole of burger were juicy with crisp, contrasting bacon.   Basically: yes, good, more!"}
{"text":"Pulled pork tacos were pretty standard; good, but nothing to write home about. Jabos Hickory Smoked chicken was very good. Great smoky flavor and cooked to perfection.  Mac and cheese side was a little lacking and not very flavorful. The combo platter ribs and brisket were dry, but had decent flavor.  Drink prices seem reasonable for the area. Nice wait staff, but still working out some kinks (understandable). Did also find a long thin hair in my side salad.  I understand this is sometimes unavoidable, but I've seen at least 1 other review stating the same issue."}
{"text":"Most amazing ribs for sure...Wouldnt go anywhere else. Bar tender was very friendly knew the drinks we wanted and carried on good conversation. The owner himself is a wonderful guy, very friendly and welcoming. If your looking for good drinks family atmosphere and the most amazing BBQ and home made food this is it !!!"}
{"text":"As someone with celiac, it's really important to be able to communicate clearly and effectively with staff at restaurants, as mix ups could lead to severe reactions. When I called Jabo's to ask abour gliten free options, the host didn't really seem to care, and didn't seem to know what she was talking about. She told me all the meats and sauces were gluten free, so I decided to come in.when we got their, I wanted to double check with our server, who had no idea what items on the menu were gluten free. After checking with the kitchen, it was revealed none of their sauces were glutwn free, and almost none of the appetizers.  Overall bad experience, and wouldn't recommend this restauraunt to anybody with allergies or dietary restrictions, as the staff is both unknowledgable and uncaring"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to love this place, but it fell short of my expectations. We were sat in the back of the restaurant in a dead-silent dining room, which had a completely different atmosphere from the area around the bar where you walk in at. If you like eating in complete silence, ask to be seated in the back! -__-  Our food was just average. I got a half-chicken and my girlfriend got the chicken sandwich. Their BBQ sauce is pretty sweet, but it's good. I would give this place one more try before writing it off."}
{"text":"Best wings and Pulled pork in Pittsburgh .  Nice find for great BBQ and Beer.  New interior and great to watch a Pens or Steeler game."}
{"text":"The food is good.  The wait staff were very slow when I went in with my family on a weeknight a couple months back.  Like, it was kind of ridiculous how slow they were.  We were embarrassed we had to stay the whole time after it was clear they didn't really care about serving us or checking up on us at all."}
{"text":"Best dry rub smoked wings I have had! This restaurant is extremely clean and recently updated, very nice atmosphere and the staff are awesome!"}
{"text":"Just had a \"quick lunch\" at Jabo's today.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!   We stood at the door for 10+ minutes waiting to be seated.  Then a bar patron said to go sit down and he'd tell the bartender.  5 more minutes before a waitress came....   1. the SWEET TEA was like licking a sugar cube - impossible to even drink it was way too sweet, but I guess that's personal opinion.  It made McDonald's sweet tea seem like water.  2. Our water glass had lipstick on it.  gag.  3. Another friend's salad was a $6 pile of the white stalk part of the lettuce and 1 wedge of tomato.  We did finally ask the waitress if we could speak to a manager.  The waitress said this was a side salad so instead of $6, charged her 2.99.  I still think a restaurant shouldn't give out the white part of lettuce in a salad.   4. my chicken sandwich tasted so smoky I pretty much just ate a campfire.  I guess that's just personal opinion.  It was a let down.  The waitress was training a new waiter.  The trainee was very nice & efficient."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times and always had good food and great service. Pittsburgh really lacks when it comes to good barbecue joints, and this place does it very well. Used to visit this location when it was del's bar. Jabo's has just about every kind of whiskey you could want so its a great place to grab a drink too."}
{"text":"Thought I'd stop in with 3 other hungry guys at Jabo's on a tuesday afternoon.  We had a warm welcome from our server and sat in a high top near the front.  The beer choices were quite good, not too many but a good sampling.  The decor was comfortable and in line with what I'd expect for a smokehouse/BBQ restaurant.  The entrees we large, I had a half chicken that was dry rubbed and received BBQ to dip in:)  The Mac and Cheese was very good, not too creamy, which I like, beans were great.  The other meals in our group, burnt end sandwich and the Jabo burger, were well enjoyed.  Overall the meal was great, price was very reasonable and it was a solid experience that I will plan on visiting and recommending again.  We met the owner and he is passionately striving to listen to feedback and see what he and the team can do to improve or continue.  I don't give out 5 star reviews often and I do when all aspects of my high expectations are met."}
{"text":"the only bad thing i have to say is the wait was an hour for our food.  went there for the first time, sister in law was in from ga, so we decided to give jabo's a try.  food was amazing, wings are to die for.  waitress was super friendly, owner spoke with us several times, just a nice atmosphere all around.  will definately be going back soon!! great addition to bloomfield neighborhood!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was awesome and gave us great recommendations. Had a killer burger and wings with drinks for my wife and I and spent under $40. The Mac & Cheese was amazing. Will come again when we're in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"I was excited to have BBQ in a convenient location. Unfortunately, I won't be returning to this spot. The service was great, but the food was less than average. The coleslaw has way to much mayo and sugar, the menus look cheap for a new place, and overall the BBQ is subpar. I expected a lot better from the rating on yelp, but it must be from friends and family of the restaurant. They could make a few easy adjustment on their look and food. But for now it's not worth the drive."}
{"text":"I ordered the brisket, ribs & chicken combo with mac & cheese and potato salad sides. Amazed by how Underwhelmed I was by everything. The brisket, chicken and ribs were bland and fairly flavorless -- like I would have gotten the same result cooking in my kitchen oven. The sides were blandly unimpressive as well. Holy bland-out! The ambience of the place is non-descript with no theme and little atmosphere which is fine by me if the food is good. For some reason there was a movie poster of Casablanca tacked on the wall opposite my table (maybe they'll get a barrel house piano player to counter ole' Sam from Rick's Cafe). My waitress was very friendly and efficient however as was the staff generally speaking... It just doesn't appear that they know what they're doing when it comes to BBQ."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place out as I had heard good things, sadly they turned out to either not be true or we came on a very off night. I will say the wings and bacon for the appetizers were very good but once we got to the entrees it went very downhill both from a food and service standpoint. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich and it came out cold around most of the sandwich besides a lukewarm center and was very dry. My dad ordered the brisket dinner and it was very dry and cold as well. My girlfriend ordered a combo platter and had the same issue with the brisket and had a curly black hair underneath her chicken breast. We alerted our waitress to the issues and she was very apologetic and promised to get it right. While we were waiting for her to take care of the issues a gentleman who identified himself as one of the owners came over. We told him about the issues and he offered replacements but said that the brisket is cooked, sliced and put into a steam tray and would most likely be no hotter or less dry. My dad decided to go for the ribs instead, I asked for a replacement sandwich but for the brisket to be heated up before being put in the bun, my girlfriend was grossed out by the hair and decided to skip eating. The owner then popped up a few minutes later with a bald gentleman and said \"hey guys I found the guy who's hair was in your food haha\" and walked away which we all found to be extremely unprofessional and definitely not a good thing to do when you're in the process of rectifying a situation after multiple mistakes. The owner then came back a few minutes later with my dad's ribs and I asked when my brisket would be coming out. He said that he didn't think I wanted it anymore so he didn't put in another order and that he went back and checked my prior sandwich by putting his finger into the center of it and that it was \"warm enough\" and became argumentative. I told him I had no wish to argue with him and would just go hungry and have him remove it from our check instead. At no time during any of our interactions with the owner did he offer and sort of apology to us for the issues we had. For the owner of a restaurant to become combative with a customer who had an issue seemed like something out of kitchen nightmares. Extremely sad to see that this business was not what we hoped for, I hope they are able to fix their issues and improve the way they interact with their customers."}
{"text":"Took a large group of my friends to Jabo's as we were looking for smoked meats and a great beer selection and thought we'd give it a try. Everyone was amazed from the time we entered the place as we were greeted by the owners who couldn't have been more accommodating to our seating request. The wait staff was awesome and very attentive to our needs.  We ordered a large selection of their smoked meats and wings for the group and couldn't believe the size of the portions.  The quality of the food was impeccable and we couldn't believe how reasonably priced it was for the quality. The beer selection is awesome! It's our new go to place in Bloomfield!  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great variety of food! Extremely friendly staff! Nice atmosphere and location in Bloomfield.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Was driving by and decided to stop with my girlfriend. It's was later in the evening and they were closing kitchen  In 15 mins, when we found that out we told them we would leave and they insisted it was fine and were very polite so we stayed and asked the chef(frank) what would be the easiest for him to cook then clean.. Frank was a very nice gentleman but the food was average at best..y bbq sandwich didn't have sauce on it and I had to get it on the side after. My girlfriends burger was rare and cold in the center when ordered medium.. nice employees but will never go back"}
{"text":"Definitely the most delicious food and best service I've received. Don't sleep on this place- go! And get some wings!"}
{"text":"No, just no. Food was tasteless. Meat (ribs, chicken and brisket) was bone dry. My broccoli tasted like it was frozen in the same bag as fish. I was so disappointed and a little angry that I had to dish out $110 (family of 4) for this horrible meal. Trust every negative review you read, I should have. I will say that our server, Glenn, was pleasant."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant for the first time. It was a Friday around 1:30PM. It was extremely cold in there. Many people complained. The management seemed to have no clue how to change things. Service was extremely slow, although there were probably less than twenty people in the restaurant. Food was plentiful, but exceedingly dry. We asked for more sauce, which again took forever. Now the food was not only dry...it was cold. We will NEVER go back. By the way...where do they smoke the meat?"}
{"text":"We decided to try Jabos due to the great reviews on Yelp. It was a new restaurant in the area so we gave it a shot.  Unfortunately we are unsure of why the ratings were so high. Firstly, the service was good and all of the staff were friendly and kind, however the food was subpar. The food was very \"home style\" is not the most pleasant way. Given all of the new and amazing restaurants on the area this does not compare. All of the food was very bland and under seasoned as well as a touch greasy. I got the chicken stack sandwich with smoked bacon and mashed potatoes and my husband got the pulled pork and Mac n cheese. The BBQ sauces were very good but everything else was nothing special. The sides were so bland that they were no different than store bought products. I would not say that the food was bad, but I would not say it was good either and we will not be returning. It was also terribly over priced"}
{"text":"Being a native Texan, I have a deep love of brisket. Low and slow with a dry rub and all the fat rendered to keep everything nice and moist is what it's all about. Since moving to Pittsburgh in 2008, we've been on a never-ending quest for decent Texas style BBQ. We've had sweet St. Louis style, We've had tangy Carolina style, but have struck out finding our true taste of home. Until now. Tonight we ate at Jabo's in Bloomfield and we were blown away with their genuine Bar-B-Q skills. 12-hour slow cooked dry rubbed brisket on an onion roll with choice of several flavors of sauce, including some that would appeal to Texans, i.e., not vinegary and not sweet. Huge pickle slice on the side and choice of side, I settled on the french fries, which were very tasty. The meat stands on its own. I forgo the sauce but instead dip my fry in it which is just right, not overshadowing the delicious brisket. This is the best brisket I've had anywhere outside of Texas.  My husband got the pulled pork sandwich and loved it, but wished he hadn't put on so much sauce as, once again, the delicious meat  stands on its own merit. This is the best pulled pork we've had since eating at Colonel Poole's Pig Hill of Fame in Elijay, Georgia. So, Jabo's had hit the ball out of the park twice. How lucky are we to find this place.   And, I can't skip overthe delicious bacon appetizer. Yummmm, bacon. Just bacon and nothing but bacon. What a way to start out what turned out to be one of the best meals we've ever eaten here in Pittsburgh.    Can't fail to mention all the nice staff that welcomed us from the host who made certain the music was on in the dining room we were seated in to Lindsey, our super friendly and attentive server. Plus we met co-owner, Jerry, and had a thoroughly enjoyable chat with him.   If Jabo's keeps cooking like this, they'll keep enjoying the great customer turnout they've already cultivated. Five stars all the way and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was too!!! Had the brisket sandwich and Mac and cheese and it was delicious! Absolutely will come back!!"}
{"text":"I've added this place to my weekly rotation of restaurants.  The environment - There's lots of room here. The main seating area room needs better heating though as it gets really cold during the winter. Not too many people come here, so it's never too noisy and the service is never slow.  The staff - The staff is usually really nice. We have a female waitress named Kerry usually and she's one of the best waitresses I've had. Always friendly and can take a complaint with a smile on her face. She's a great symbol for this place.  The food - I usually order chili cheese fries and ribs here and my mom gets the salad. The portion sizes are great and they give you more than enough to make a 2nd meal out of. The ribs are nice and big but you have to make sure to let them know you want BBQ sauce on your ribs. They do not put any sauce at all on the ribs otherwise, which I find strange. They'll be happy to fix it for you though. My mom said the salad is really good. The chili-cheese fries have squares of beef which is different, but they taste fine. Wished they used cheese sauce instead of shredded cheese, but again, the taste is fine. They also use a neat garlic seasoning on their plain fries which goes really well with the ribs. They also give you a piece of cornbread which tastes good.  The price - The prices aren't too bad and the portions are extremely generous. When I come here, I know I'm also getting a meal for the next day as well.  Overall thoughts - I gave it 5/5. Nice staff, good food, the price:portion ratio is worth it. I really hope this place makes it as it is part of our weekly rotation."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped in by chance as we were driving home from Oakland. I found the restaurant on Yelp. We love southern BBQ and this restaurant proved to be true to the south's flavors! I had the beef brisket and sweet potato. Yummy. The service was impeccable. The atmosphere is trendy and comfy."}
{"text":"What a great location in booming Bloomfield. I'm always down for BBQ and I was definitely excited to try Jabo's out. Unfortunately, the food didn't quite meet my expectations.  The hub ordered the Jabo sandwich (brisket with mac and cheese) and I got the combo platter (ribs, chicken, and brisket). We also got a side of cole slaw, which I did not like at all. I should've read some reviews before ordering it, as it's very mayonnaise-y. It's basically all mayonnaise with a bit of cabbage mixed in. In terms of the entrees, I thought both the brisket and ribs could have used more flavor. Jabo's gave me three different sauces, but I wasn't a huge fan of any of them. I usually like a darker, sweet sauce, which one of my sauce options fit that criteria. However, it didn't blow me away. The other two sauces were on the tangy side. What I did like was the chicken which had a nice crispiness to the skin and a mild smoke flavor.   While the service was good, I don't think it made up for the less than enjoyable food. I'm not sure if I'll be back. If I do return, I will try something that isn't BBQ, which is a shame since that's what they specialize in."}
{"text":"Haven't even received my meal yet and I'm writing a review.  Jill is our server, she's upbeat and amazing.  Appetizers.. wings, pulled pork nachos, and bacon. Yes.. bacon. The wings were perfectly crispy and their dry rub is fantastic. The pulled pork on the nachoes melted in our mouths and was seasoned perfectly. The tortilla chips were crispy not soggy, bonus! The bacon.. what else can I say? It's bacon.. yes, you heard me! smokey.. delicious.. bacon.   Soups.. chili and chicken tortilla soup. There was no shortage of meat in this chili. Seasoned perfectly and filling! The chicken tortilla soup wasn't a favorite but everything can't be a win. Generous with the chicken but the broth wasn't spectacular.  Sides.. Cornbread and Mac n Cheese. Cornbread.. I loved it! Smothered it in butter and dipped it in my chili.. To. Die. For. However, the mac n cheese lacked in flavor, texture, and color. It tasted watered down and had next to no cheese flavor. (This was taken care of on our bill.)  Entrees.. Bloomfield brisket, half rack of ribs, Cajun burger, and another burger I forget the name of. Bloomfield brisket has onions and peppers with melted provolone, I chose to have it on an onion roll. Brisket was succulent. The ribs came out completely overdone, also taken care of on the bill. Both burgers were cooked as preferred and the meat was seasoned perfectly. Juicy and excellent portion size.   If 3.5 stars was an option, I would have given that as opposed to the 4."}
{"text":"Normally, I'd offer some slack cause this place has only been open for 2 months...but it's not even worth it. I had the ribs and chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and beans.  What's good: the bathroom   What's bad: - the ribs where dry, not that smokey, or seasoned...like at all, no dry rub or mop. WHAT!!??? Who does that?! - the chicken was dry and again, lacking...oooooh, what's that called.????? oh yeah!!!...FLAVOR!!!!!! - garlic mashed potatoes, again, DRY AF!! They're lumpy barely mashed and lacking that velvety mouth coating texture so easily achieved by adding those very exotic ingredients, like milk and butter. - the beans where runny and of the Campbell's sorts, again, little flavor with the consistency of soup....yuuuuuk...damn - OMG!! I have to mention the BBQ sauces     *regular = too sweet, my gawd, too sweet     *bold = is the regular, with too much vinegar     *spicy = not terrible????   The bar and bartender, both, emitted an ora of indifference towards actual cocktails.  The music was white, and annoying. Your a BBQ joint, get some soul.  Another thing I just noticed when leaving is an old pizza peel nailed to the wall, maybe to pay homage to the previous owners? Idk, but TAKE IT DOWN, your a BBQ place.  This place is annoying, lacks depth, lacks moisture, lacks flavor and lacks character.  Damn Pittsburgh, you just can't make good BBQ happen. No offense to Wilsons."}
{"text":"Pork was dry and over-seasoned, I couldn't discern many flavors as the excessive amount of salt and whole peppercorns dominated. Cole slaw and baked beans were pretty average."}
{"text":"Brisket stuffed baked potato was great. Brisket was melt in your mouth.  A saltiness of bacon would have been a great addition.  Brisket burger was a great end to a long day.  The coleslaw and pulled pork was a perfect compliment to the burger."}
{"text":"Not having any good ribs for a long time since Max and Erma closed, I decided to try this  place. DREADFUL!!!  The Manhattan I ordered had a thimbleful of liquor where the cherry took up most of the room! It cost $5.50 and I was told that if I ordered a double, it would be twice as much money. I ordered the half rack of ribs with side orders of Mac and cheese and a baked potato. The ribs had a dry, tasteless crust on top and below it there was overcooked mushy and tasteless meat! The Mac and cheese was also dry and tasteless. NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Jabo's for lunch. Giving this place 3 stars out of 5 is probably generous. On a positive note, the place does have a small parking lot on the side of the building, which is great considering it is in Bloomfield. Also, the wait staff were pleasant and attentive. The amount of food was good for the reasonable price.  But the food was mediocre at best. A better descriptor would be 'bland'. Like many others, been looking for good bbq in Pittsburgh, but still looking after eating at Jabo's. Had the 1/4 lb brisket platter with mac & cheese and coleslaw. The brisket was a tender piece of meat, but had zero bark or color on the outside edges. I really doubt this was smoked at all, since it had no smoke flavor what-so-ever. The coleslaw was bland. The mac & cheese was also flavorless. The bbq sauce provided on the plate was overly sweet and not at all spicy. The interiors are uninspiring - including faux-painted fake brick walls. This place adds nothing to the vibrant Bloomfield neighborhood. And the owners and cooks know nothing about authentic bbq or smoked meats."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and wanted to give Jabos a try. The food was great and so was the service. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"So happy to have this place near by! I was bummed when the Del's location was vacant for so long but happy to hold out for this place!   First of all the inside is great. Totally different than Del's with a beautiful tin roof, cool lighting, a nice long bar and two dining rooms for a variety of different \"atmospheres\" in the same place.   The bar has lots of options and beer prices are reasonable. The menu is extensive with so many things I want to try.   My sister had the pulled chicken quesadilla and it was awesome. I had the smoque stack sandwich and it was REALLY good. The brisket had a great flavor and was really tender and the bacon on it was thick and juicy (sometimes bacon that is added on to a sandwich gets neglected). I had the sandwich on the onion roll which is also really good. For the side I had the mac and cheese. The sauce was flavorful with a hint of pepper jack. It could have been warmer but I think they are still working out some kinks, and I'm much more picky about food temp than most people.   My boyfriend had the combo platter with ribs, chicken and brisket with potato salad and cornbread. We liked that they gave you a choice of white or dark chicken meat. Everything was well seasoned and tasty and it was a huge amount of food for the price. The potato salad wasn't the greatest -- a little too much mayo, but the cornbread was probably the best I've ever had.   Service was excellent as well. We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVED this place!  I went with the Jabo's Burger, my girl got the dark meat quarter chicken. Potatoes were wicked, beer was noice, the Mac and cheese was the creamiest, and the service?  Fantastic. You guys  killed it from every angle, keep it up yo!"}
{"text":"After having some of the best BBQ of my life down South - I was hankering for more when I returned to Pittsburgh. After a friend recommended the place after eating there the week before, so we went back and brought some buddies.  I was thoroughly impressed. Not only is the pricing great, but the portions are large and the food is excellent. The beer is cheap as well and there is something on the menu for everyone, even those who aren't a fan of traditional BBQ.  The highlights for me were the ribs and the nacho appetizer, but everything was delicious, including the brisket, chicken, and pulled pork. Pittsburgh's BBQ scene just got a massive upgrade with the opening of Jabo's. It's some of the best BBQ I've ever had and in my mind it's the new king of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Nice variety of foods  (not a meat eater so can't comment there) Great space especially in the back room for a group,   Kerry was awesome.   Very accommodating from bills to temperature to music!   Spacious bar.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Interesting to see this BBQ place pop up as a new business one day and that got this place on my radar to come check out. Came in to see a rather lavish interior with plenty of seating all around and a very nicely done bar. Unfortunately, can't say all the same for the food. Though the sides were adequate, I found the brisket to be a bit disappointing, considering that I've had Texas brisket cuts before, the ones found here are not even close to the real deal. Chicken was alright, although I think most places can do chicken well ... least I hope they do. Ribs were sorta disappointing, too. Way smaller than I anticipated and definitely not as juicy and flavorful as I expected. I'd say even the Costco St. Louis rib racks are more juicy and better tasting than the ones found here. All in all, a very average experience at best ... certainly not worth the hype it's been given as a new establishment."}
{"text":"We decided to come here on a Saturday night after reading many great reviews and wanting to try some BBQ. We arrived around 8 to find a half-filled dining area in the front and a busy bar. We were seated immediately and given menus. The dining area has a TV, but was much quieter than the bar area, so I could have an actual conversation with my husband. There is another dining space in the rear, which was not in use the night we were there.   We were greeted by a waitress, but another waiter ended up taking care of us the entire night. After explaining the menu and BBQ procedures to us, he left us to browse the menu. They have a nice draft list and some house wines at reasonable prices. I ordered the Pinot noir and my husband had a bottle of Guinness. They arrived promptly and we then ordered.   I had the smoked wings, which were delicious. I'm used to fried wings, but these were crispy and covered in a flavorful dry rub. I loved them! I had a side of the bold and tangy sauces, which were adequate. Maybe I'll try the spicier options next time! I also had a side of fries, which were thick and crispy but not the best fries in the 'Burgh. I wish they have collard greens as an option...but maybe that's too southern?   My husband ordered the brisket and pulled pork sandwich with a side of homefries. He was underwhelmed by the brisket, noting that it could have been smoked longer and needed more flavor. He did like the pulled pork, but had to eat everything with a fork since it was too hard to eat such a large sandwich on a bun. The bun was fine and fresh, just big! The homefries were crispy and came with peppers and onions, a nice addition.   The waiter was kind and attentive, literally running to get us more BBQ sauce at one point. We will soon be returning to try some of their other options! Overall it was a fine experience if not amazing. We live close by so it's nice to have another option for a quick and cheap dinner."}
{"text":"The place is nice and neat. Good atmosphere. Food was great! We came for lunch and have taco briskets and sandwich briskets both were delicious.  Service was very very good. Everyone with great smile and wiling to serve"}
{"text":"I had an awful experience at Jabo's last night.  I went on a Thursday night. The restaurant was empty, and there were three folks sitting at the bar.  The bartender took about five minutes to ask me if I needed a drink or even a menu. I ordered my food (a half rack of ribs with broccoli and fries). The bartender repeated my order, and all was fine.    I was brought out my food. They brought a full rack of ribs, and I said to the server that I had ordered a half rack.  She said \"no problem, we will box it up for you at the end, and adjust your check.\"  The food was fine.  There are much better barbecue restaurants in Pittsburgh. I then asked for my check, which was brought to me and had the full rack of ribs on it. I asked about it, and mentioned the conversation that I had with the server.  The bartender then went to talk to the manager about it, and the manager says to me \"well you are taking the full rack home in a box. So, I have to charge you for it. I'd be happy to take the leftovers back.\"  What are you going to do? Take the ribs back and serve it to someone else?! Needless to say, I was overcharged $15 for something that I didn't order, and also did not take home.    As I said, the food was not bad, but based on this experience I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious is an understatement. All of the smoked meats are amazing, highly recommend the brisket and the bold sauce (not too spicy at all).  Tried the mac & cheese, garlic mashed potatoes, and corn bread sides- can't go wrong with any of them.  Very fair pricing, love this spot!!"}
{"text":"Its hard to find good BBQ in Pittsburgh. It's even harder to find it in Jabo's Smoque House. I went with my family in summer of 2017. The bartender and wait staff were fine, but the food was just not worth the money. We shared the Brisket, Pulled Pork, Ribs, and 1/2 Chicken. Of those 4 dishes I'd say only the chicken was tastier than something you could for lunch get at Donatelli's for $2.50. Nothing was worth the price, especially considering what $12 will get you at Tessaro's, Lot 17, Thai Cuisine or Gourmet, BBT, Caliente, or even Nico's. The side dishes were very disappointing. When I saw my Mom putting salt on the mac and cheese I thought she was having a senior moment. When I tried some of it, I longed for a pot of hot water and the $2.75 it would cost to buy a box of Velveeta shells and cheese from ShurSave, though considering their prices it's probably $6.50 by now. This place is not worth my time or money. Maybe someone with more of both will try it in a few months and it will have improved by then. Dopey name aside, it would be nice to have a decent BBQ place besides Tessaro's on Tuesday or whatever."}
{"text":"Never again. The food was not good and the quality of service (bar and chef) was bad.  I'm not one who will complain much about a restaurant and it takes a lot for me to dislike a place. My boyfriend and I went here for the first time and our experience was AWFUL! They were out of the beer I wanted (which was ok because I know that happens) and they were out of the brisket dinner entree... on a Saturday. Which was not a big deal until they told a couple they were out of it 40 minutes AFTER we had arrived there (the couple was there before us). During our wait for our food, three tables left before receiving their food. They were not busy at all from what we could see in the dining area either. Plenty of empty tables.   My boyfriend also ordered a beer and after trying his, I asked for the same... when I received mine, it was not the same as his. Two different beers (huge color difference and taste). He ordered a second beer after finishing the first and the beer he ordered tasted exactly the same as the first (we both agreed without doubt on the taste). The beer was also expensive and so was their wine. They charged $5.75 for a glass of sutter home moscato - insanely expensive for the type of wine.   When our appetizer, the nachos, came, the pork on them was cold, and the cheese was not melted at all. When our food came, my coleslaw was simply coleslaw/shredded cabbage without mayo, and my boyfriends baked beans tasted spoiled/bad. We didn't eat either (note: we are the LEAST picky eaters you will ever meet!). The pulled pork is also very very fatty - it was either very burnt, or 90% fat. Still don't feel well after eating that.   I felt bad for the waitress because none of these issues were her fault. Definitely do not recommend this place to anyone unless they make some changes."}
{"text":"I am totally at a loss as to how Jabos is 4 stars. To be quite honest I was kind of disgusted with my meal and the decor is just a total fail.  I had high hopes for Jabos before I ate there due to the positive reviews however as soon as I walked in the door I was completely skeptical just by the decor. You can tell a lot about the quality of a restaurant just by their decor. The tables and chairs seemed old, they had cheap dollar store plastic salt and pepper shakers on the tables and they have dirty commercial grade carpet!! Restaurants please DO NOT have carpet on the floors..it's really gross! It makes the place feel cheap and dirty. It had a Pizza Hut kinda vibe going.  My husband and I both ordered a brisket sandwich and a side salad. The salad was so bad, I didn't even finish it. It was basically a bowl of the white ends of iceberg lettuce. The brisket (if you can even call it brisket) was SOOOO DRY! I had to drench it in BBQ sauce just to stomach it. I have had some of the best brisket in Texas and this my friend is NOT brisket!!! Real brisket is SO juicy, a little pink, falls apart when you try and pick it up and best of all you don't need any sauce because it has enough flavor on its own.  This review may come across harsh but Pittsburgh has a lot of really good restaurants so if you wanna compete you have to be on top of your game. There are also a few other places in Pittsburgh that serve brisket and they are by far way better and much closer to what you will find in Texas.  Please do not waste your time or money eating here!"}
{"text":"I loved the idea of Jabos and thought the menu had a lot to offer. I got the Jabo which was very good, would have liked a little more macaroni and cheese on it though. I got the side of cornbread which was phenomenal, and then paid an extra $2.99 for a side of potato salad which is where I was disappointed. While the potato salad tasted good, I received a tiny portion with only about 6 potato pieces in it. In addition, our waitress had NO idea what was going on, she said it was her first day so I gave her the benefit of the doubt but she could not even remember a simple drink order, even after writing it down and had to run to the bar to ask a question every time we ordered something. I am also a waitress so I can understand a bad first day, but somebody should have been training her or she should have shadowed another server.  All in all, good food and nice environment. Just bigger side portions if you're up charging and please please please train your servers before throwing them out there if they have never served before! Once little New opening kinks are ironed out, I think this will be a great place and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best, if not the best BBQ joint in Pittsburgh!! My husband had the St. Louis style ribs and they were fall off the bone tender. I, myself, had the brisket which was very tender and full of flavor. Next was the BBQ sauces, oh my goodness!!! They are amazing!! Beer selection is wonderful and they definitely make sure to have something for everyone's palate. Our waitress, Brooke, was very hospitable. She made sure that we enjoyed our meal and our experience. We will most certainly be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to see a BBQ place open up in Bloomfield and it's definitely worth checking out! This restaurant replaced Del's, just next to the Bloomfield Bridge.   You enter in the bar room and then can walk through to two additional dining areas. The bar room has a few TV's and would be a great place to come to watch a game. The atmosphere is completely different than when it was Del's and it has greatly improved! Our service was great, the food was timely and my boyfriend and I were both glad to get sucked into playing Jeopardy while we waited. (There is a large TV in the dining room where we were seated)  The beer list is reasonably priced with a good mix of light domestics and heavier craft beers. The food is also reasonably priced for great portions. I went with a brisket sandwich and my boyfriend had a combo platter of ribs and chicken. The sides are pretty generic; we went with mac & cheese, cole slaw and potato salad. I'd say those were all pretty average quality. While all of the meat was done well and delicious, I was most impressed with the smoked chicken.   They also have a variety of BBQ sauces ranging from a house version to some other sweeter or spicier options."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a local BBQ place open up. Jabo's is fine if you don't love BBQ. My fiance's family comes from St. Louis, so we have a pretty high standard that has yet to be met in all of Pittsburgh. The ribs we ordered were okay. But the rest of the meal went downhill. Nothing was horrible, but nothing stood out or had a real smokey BBQ flavor."}
{"text":"Jabo's was a great experience, from beginning to end. We had the bacon appetizer to start, it was the best, thick, crunch on the outside, not salty, meaty on the inside. The burger I had was delicious, ground rough with the taste of beef and a bite; it was topped with the same bacon, on an onion bun. I tried the corn bread as my side, unique in that it was moist, I think there was a taste of jalapeno in there that just added to the flavor. The half ribs were tender, and the meat fell right off the bone. The half chicken was heavy in smoke flavor. Neither came with a sauce, but, sauces were available. The atmosphere was great, comfortable, made for friends and relaxing. We remember the restaurant this place was, it's not at all the same. It is new, a place you know will be welcoming to the neighborhood and travelers for years to come. A new gem in Bloomfield. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Loved the bacon appetizer and the brisket.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food/drinks are good, if you are lucky enough to have the service to deliver it. 3 people behind the bar standing around & we can't get a drink. Servers seem to be overextended - out of breathe when delivering our meal after an hour of waiting, while the bartender refuses to take our drink order while the server runs around trying to attend to everyone on the floor. Adjustments need to be made or this is just another Dels."}
{"text":"Well my brother in law heard great things about this place. I ordered the pork entree. 1/3 of my pork was fat. Even the waitress thought it was a lot. But didn't offer anything. My mom got the ribs. Not bad. Some tough. Some falling off the bone. Charred a bit too much. Definitely not my favorite Pittsburgh eats."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The brisket, ribs, and sandwiches are all great. The one issue I have is when I got a to go order the portion size of the sides was minuscule. That was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Very good meal overall. Prices are reasonable. Started with the smoked wings which are some of the best wings I've EVER had. Honestly, they were juicy and cooked perfectly well. For dinner my husband and I both had the brisket which was tasty. They had a lot of different BBQ sauces to try which were tasty. The garlic mashed potatoes were good. Broccoli was a bit bland. My husband had corn bread which he said was very good but the mac n cheese was not good at all. Bland and sort of amorphous. The service was good. Our server was attentive and checked in on us several times and refilled our waters and drinks. Overall definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Jabo's four stars. We had dinner here the other night and is didn't disappoint. We got there a little late, around 8:00 or so and had an easy time getting seated. The seating area is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside.  We started off with an order of 9 wings as an appetizer. They were really freaking good! I'm not sure how exactly the make them, but they were awesome, and that's without any sauce. For a meal I ordered the brisket, chicken, and ribs combo. The ribs were unreal! Loved them, sadly there were only three though. The chicken was good, but nothing too amazing. I didn't really care for the brisket, just seemed a little chewy to me.  You get two sides with you meal and I ordered the beans and corn bread. I was brought the bean and mac and cheese by mistake. The server realized this and brought the corn bread out quick. The mac and cheese was good as was the corn bread, but I didn't care for the beans. My friends at the table said the loved the beans and quickly ate them all, so opinions may vary.  Overall a good experience with good food and good service. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here on their third day open. The staff was amazing. You could tell that they were excited to be open and that they were proud of what they were serving.   I ordered 6 wings with the dry rub. They were amazing.   I then had the pork shoulder with a sweet potato and broccoli as sides. The total order was under $20 and I couldn't finish it. This is coming from the guy who prefers buffets because I hate not getting full.   Everything was great.  I liked it just as much as Union Pig and Chicken except I paid a lot less.   I'm really excited to have this place a block from my apartment."}
{"text":"I am kind of bummed that I have to give Jabo's only 3 stars! The service was good, the brisket was tasty. However, there wasn't anything that really impressed me. i ordered mac n' cheese and it didn't really have a taste at all. My boyfriend and I got different sauces but I also couldn't discern too much of a difference between the two. They were both tomato-based and overall decent but, again, nothing really standout. I am not opposed to going back to Jabo's but I would hope that they just get better with age!"}
{"text":"Opening night so the crowd was mostly friends and family - and us! St. Louis rib appetizer - delicious. No sauce needed, but tangy sauce was a tasty add. Potato salad is sour cream based, not mayo, also delicious (I would add some more celery, scallions and green pepper, but that's me). His brisket sandwich was substantial and good - side salad was generic (not in a bad way) and balsamic vinagrette was lip-smacky. $36 including tip and a beer (I was charged for a club soda, which should just never be) makes it not an everyday visit, but we will be back. Great addition to the neighborhood, based on this first impression. (The bartender recommends the grilled chicken so that will likely be next...)"}
{"text":"Wanted to check out this new place in Bloomfield, and what has been done post Del's. The inside definitely switched around where the bar used to be located on the left if you are standing in front, and the dining to the right which is now reversed. Overall, they did a nice job on the place inside. Now for the good stuff...or not so good stuff...  My partner and I went in Saturday night around 9 PM and sat at the bar, and were greeted by someone friendly when we went in. It was maybe five minutes until we were greeted by one bartender, and since we were not ready that bar tender disappeared and then were greeted by a female bartender who was much more attentive, warm, and friendly who got us our drinks. The bar had cleared out by 9:15. I ordered the house margarita which was fairly priced and my partner ordered a beer. We had another friend meeting us, but felt very pressured by the male bartender to put in an order for drinks and food, he was not so warm and smooth.. maybe his shift was ending and he wanted to get out of there ASAP?   So, our friend met us, and then we decided on three things:  APPETIZER: Cajun Fries served w/  Cajun dipping sauce DINNERS: 1/2 rack of ribs with fries & mac n cheese  + smoked half chicken with sweet potato and broccoli.  As our dinners were coming out the appetizer was nowhere to be found and hadn't come out, but wait... it was coming out behind the dinners.   Smoked Chicken: very greasy, as if it was smoked then dropped in a deep fryer, but the technique completely failed and the amount of oil and grease made me sick. The broccoli tasted like MEAT, it literally tasted like it was steamed or cooked, or stored with meat, I couldn't even eat it. Sweet potato, well you can't mess up a sweet potato really.   Ribs : not such a good quality of meat, and the mac n cheese was not too good either. The sauce was served on the side, but the bartender did not really educate us on the sauces or what there specialty was, recommended etc.  Cajun Fries: Just frozen fries, with some cajun seasoning on them, and an attempt at cajun aioli. The cajun fries were the only good thing that we received food wise.   Overall, I agree with DJ J. who left a review on 1/5/17 that said how interesting it is with 5 Star reviews; Has anyone else been to all of the OTHER amazing restaurants in Pittsburgh vs. Jabos ?   I was not impressed by any of means, no WOW factor here, folks.  With all of the amazing food, trendy restaurants, and creative ideas Pittsburgh offers, this place has a lot of work ahead. As far as the service, Jabo's definitely landed for the most part good people, but their overall operations needs some work, and the food is nothing I would ever drop money on again with Tessaro's right down Liberty, Shadyside five minutes away, and Lawrenceville not far either. The couple next to us ordered, the bartenders and staff apologized because they ordered salads and it had been sometime since they came out, the dressings were missing , etc. I would say give Jabo's the benefit of the doubt since they just opened, but these are restaurant basics 101 they are missing the swing on.   Would maybe stop in for drinks ,but will not short myself of great food the Steel City has to offer again on Saturday night here.Good luck to others who try it out , maybe your experience and food will be worth it."}
{"text":"Visited for dinner and had a great meal. The prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you get. Only critique is that the sides are only okay. My macaroni was very meh. Though the sweet and spicy cornbread was quite tasty. Service was excellent.  We also held an event here in their back room and our service was wonderful. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about the latest bar/restaurant in Bloomfield. The food is amazing. I had tortilla soup and my daughter had a hamburger and fries.   Jabo's also serves what I consider to be the most authentic Irish coffee in Pittsburgh. I was just in San Francisco at the Buena Vista in the spring so that's the basis for my comparison.The staff is very friendly and helpful and are actively working on offering the best service on the avenue."}
{"text":"Great barbecue for a very reasonable price.  We had the sampler platter (ribs, brisket and pulled pork) and, despite the large portions, there were no leftovers."}
{"text":"I went to Jabo's this afternoon for lunch, the bar area was pretty crowded, which provided a nice ambiance. I ordered the Bloomfield Brisket, which was amazing! My friend ordered the smoked wings, which may be some of the best wings i have ever had. The beer was cold and the food was great! I will be back very very soon!"}
{"text":"The burger I ordered was adequate, the smoked pork on it divine. The attitude from the waiter, deplorable. My fiancees chicken breast was cold, likely from sitting during our 30 minute wait for our food.  We bring it to the waiters attention, and he rolls his eyes in disgust.   Manager brings a plate of bacon and an apology, along with excuses for the waiter. Handled well by the manager but seriously will not be back."}
{"text":"Great BBQ is only part of the story here. The brisket was great but don't sell short the other menu items if you have someone in the group who doesn't like bbq. Meatballs are great and they have Sammie's corned beef too!  Cool build out in and old school bar and I'm looking forward to the patio for the spring. Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Jabo's on a snowy Saturday afternoon. The decor is decent, the food was decent and the service was a little better than decent. Beer selection, though good for a pittsburgh restaurant say 15 years ago was pretty much par for the course. Not over inspired but certain that you can find a something reasonable to drink. Disappointed to not find a single stout or porter on tap despite it being the dead of winter. Only Guinness by the bottle. There is better smoked meat available in Lawrenceville so i will not likely go out of my way to return unless my other standards are closed. I wish them luck. I am sure if i lived in the neighborhood and could walk that i would visit it again. Certainly a good addition to Bloomfield but not a destination spot."}
{"text":"Excited to see the old Del's in Bloomfield get a new life as a barbecue destination. We enjoyed what turned out to be a very large lunch here a few days ago. Large enough that I had leftover lunches the following 2 days. I ordered the combo platter with brisket, ribs, chicken and 2 sides. My husband ordered 1/2 lb. of brisket which also comes with 2 sides.    There are definitely some winners on the menu - the brisket, mac & cheese and their wonderful house made barbecue sauce all top my list of items I will need to have again. The ribs and chicken were good, but the brisket made both take a backseat. Although my meal came with 3 different barbecue sauces, the house made one was my clear winner.   Some of the side dishes could use some work. The baked beans need more flavor and both the coleslaw & potato salad are very mayonnaise centric. Personally I think mayo should remain hidden in the background of a sauce. A little work on the side dishes could really elevate the dining experience.   One of the chefs came out to greet us after our meal and we happily shared how much we love what they're doing here. Overall I'd give them 3.5 stars but that brisket pushes it up to a 4!"}
{"text":"Yummy food - love how they redid the inside of the place - called ahead & good was ready right in time. Very friendly staff - definitely will be back"}
{"text":"There food is the bomb! I normally don't eat ribs . I don't even need sauce on these. We have sent 2 - 3 groups to Jabo's & they all love the food. 5 stars plus!!!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I was so excited to come here, I was so excited for BBQ that was close to my house, I just left let down though. The food was not good at all. After Union closed down I have been searching for a place to compare and to get my BBQ fix at. This will not be that place. I had really high hopes and they fell very flat. The only thing that was good about the place was the wings and maybe the service (our waitress was really nice).    Appetizers:  WINGS: Smoked and Grilled with dry rub or choice of BBQ sauce. Served with ranch or blue cheese and celery. These were really good. The wings were a great smokey flavor and so juicy. We got them with a dry rub and some BBQ sauce on the side for dipping. The waitress did not ask if we wanted ranch or blue cheese dressing so we got the ranch. That was fine, I like blue cheese but ranch is always a nice choice. I will say that the celery was only two sticks. I like just a little bit more greenery with my wings. But this appetizer was really filling and I would suggest it.   Main Dish:  COMBO PLATTER: 1/4 Rack of ribs, 1/4 Chicken and 1/4lb Brisket and two sides. This is where the meal went wrong. All the meat was just dry and hard to eat and just blah. Brisket should not be the same taste and consistency as beef jerky. I could not believe that it was so tough. I was chewing through it and thinking that my jaw might fall off. The chicken was equally dry. We had to keep on drinking water to try to get it down! I could not believe it! How could you serve those two meats and think that they were edible? The ribs were ok. They were juicy and flavorful but very fatty. I know, ribs are fatty, but these seemed overly fatty and we were both put off. Nothing on that platter was good. Nothing at all. We had some of the meat leftover and when the waitress asked us about boxes we refused. WE never refuse!!! We would not leave food no matter what, but this was just..ehh.. Also as a BBQ sauce fan, the three sauces were not even that great. Subpar. Blah...   Sides:  Cornbread: This was actually pretty OK and had a hit of spice to it. I don't know if it was jalapenos or what. It was pretty good.   Mac and Cheese: Congealed cheese and noodles. Stay away.   I was not impressed and even more so I am disappointed. Maybe I will try them again once they get their act together and go through their growing pains. But until then, I am staying away."}
{"text":"Stopped in to meet a friend.    Was interesting in trying with so many 5 Star Reviews from many with only 1 review, knew many of the reviews must be experts. Ha!  We sat in the bar area that has 3 TV's over the bar and a TV beside the door for a table in the window.  Our server was good but seemed to always have to ask everyone a question when inputing the order in the system so there was some loud asking about type of sauce or bun or whatever across the bar and room. Must be a new wait person that hasn't figured out what is needed to complete the order when asking at the table.  There are about 20 beers on tap and pricing was good.  Ordered The Jabo which is Brisket topped with homemade macaroni and cheese and Jabo's signature BBQ sauce, on a fresh baked roll with a pickle spear and one side.  The sandwich was interesting. My brisket was mostly cold, thought it should be warmer and did not have much of the smoke BBQ flavor I expected.  The mac & cheese was OK, prefer it to be sharper cheese.  My side of baked beans was good and spicy.  As for the pickle spear..it did not appear and I just decided not to ask.  Looks like Jabo's has some service issues to work out but since they just recently opened will have to give them the benefit of being new."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what Bloomfield has been missing. The bar area is warm, inviting & affordable (no beer on tap was more than $5.50). And the seats were nice and comfy! I'd have no problem settling in to watch a game there. The service was great, the owners were even better and the food was delicious. We had the chicken, brisket, and pulled pork with Mac and cheese, slaw, fries, and a house salad as our sides, and honestly, everything was really great. The couple next to us loved everything they tried, too. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Carlos the manager/bartender/server was amazing. It was pretty packed but we had our pours and order taken within five minutes of sitting down at one of the high tops on the bar side of restaurant.  Ordered three tacos (just 9.99 for all) to share: BBQ brisket, pulled pork and fish.  The fish taco was ok, decent, tasty. The pulled pork taco was fragrant and flavorful. But, the Brisket taco, OMG...super delish melt in your mouth with an out of this world smoked flavor. I could eat the brisket tacos for days. Everything coming out of the kitchen for other tables looked like it all needed to be in my belly. All of the brisket in all forms---in my belly, now. Living just a few blocks from here I'm happy to see the old Del's has a new breath of life. The interior is clean and modern with a down south BBQ joint kind of feel. Can't wait to come back and eat more!!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and was a little disappointed there were no happy hour specials or menu items.  So I ordered some brisket & pulled pork taco's from the dinner menu and they were fairly ordinary.  They only had shredded lettuce/cheese/tomato on it, could have been a little more imaginative with the toppings (some type of slaw).  And I had to ask for extra BBQ sauce since there was barely any on the taco's.  I guess they need to work the kinks out since they are new, but please consider adding a happy hour menu and being more creative with your taco's"}
{"text":"First time visitor,  had a nice look to the bar area. The front dining area looked a little rough like it was thrown together pretty fast . Bar had a half decent draft list . Tried the brisket Sammy with bacon and cheddar .super tasty bacon and brisket . Nice bun and had an excellent baked potato with it. Tire the pulled pork and it was tasty as well as the mac and cheese and the Cole slaw. Solid meal and would definitely eat here again."}
