{"text":"Yes, pricey... Um you are in Vegas. Illy coffee is always solid. Their almond croissant, best one I've eaten. Grapefruit salad, pairs nicely with my croissant.  Like the name, doing good. Overall legit."}
{"text":"Delicious, creamy gelato.  The best I've had.  The sugar free chocolate gelato is so outstanding you can't tell it's sugar free."}
{"text":"A lot of reviewers commented on the high prices........ Come on people, this is the Cosmopolitan and if you're staying at the hotel, you already are paying a higher than averge price for the rooms, so paying $6 for coffee is normal.

I've been here many times.  Their butter croissants are out of this world!  They're flaky and layered and just melt in your mouth.  The Italian breakfast sandwich is also very yummy and can be shared.  The ice cream is smooth and creamy.  The muffins were a tad on the dry side but yummy as well.

Nothing beats a caffe mocha and a croissant after you've rolled put of bed and stumbled down to this place.  I just wish they had other locations."}
{"text":"Cute cafe inside the cosmopolitan.
Modern seating area and design.
Friendly and service.

Coffee was good, but not worth 4.60$ for a medium."}
{"text":"We stopped for breakfast this morning. Everything was ok, but not wonderful. The cashier wasn't listening & failed to give us our pastries. My husbands mocha was more like hot chocolate & my was just ok. My muffin was a bit on the stale side."}
{"text":"Great pistachio gelato and service was friendly and fantastic!  Would stop by every time we come to Vegas! Did I mention the pistachio gelato?"}
{"text":"Service - 6
Atmosphere - 6
Food - 7
Vegetarian Friendly - 9
General Awesomeness - 6

Great gelato, we got some pastries to go for breakfast the next day, they were good too.  Nothing really stood out as great, but nothing wrong either.  If you are walking by and want a coffee or some sweets, stop it.  Don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has negative reviews, but for morning coffee and pastries this place is pretty good. Compared to room service, this place is cheap! Have had coffee and pastries from this place almost every morning while in Vegas over the last two years, and it's a good value. Way better than Starbucks too! The only complaint is they can be a little slow sometimes, but sometimes it takes time to make a specialty coffee so I understand. Overall, a great place to grab a quick breakfast!"}
{"text":"Worst cappuccino ever. This place is not Italian. It is just branded with two Italian words. That does not mean you get it right."}
{"text":"Coffe was bland but the espresso was good. Hard to mess up espresso tho I guess. Staff was really nice tho. Starbucks is better and I don't say that lightly."}
{"text":"I work at a retail store in the cosmopolitan and I often stop in here before my morning shift. Victoria is always personable and greets me by name, and every member of the staff is helpful and very nice. Prices are a little steep, but I'm always happy with my beverage. 

I recommend the grapefruit salad and the pastries are always fresh!"}
{"text":"If you like being taken advantage of, go here- this could be your morning coffee run.. We were staying at the Cosmo and decided on our last day to give this coffee shop a try instead if walking across to the PH Starbucks. Tried to order 2 iced coffees with flavor, one with soy. Had to give the order THREE times to the woman behind the counter. Also got a blueberry muffin and a banana. The first time it was rung up, the total was $18. I handed her my money, when all of a sudden the total jumps to $26 (!). I questioned the mark-up and the on duty manager came over. She verified my order as iced coffees, I said yes, and yet it still got rung up as $26. I don't care how fancy, or expensive a hotel is- at some point it becomes price gauging and taking advantage of tourists. I told them to forget the order, I would go to Starbucks. Staff tried to tell me it would cost the same there (we actually laughed at that). Ordered the SAME thing at the 'bucks, came to TEN dollars less. Take the five minutes to cross the walkway to Planet Hollywood!!"}
{"text":"I like this place because it is one of the very few places that serve Illy coffee. It reminded me of a cafe in Rome. Located in the Cosmopolitan, it is convenient place to get your coffee and food to go. Also, they have quick eats here like sandwiches, salads, and pastries. The place doesn't have a table, but you can stand and get a quick bite. There is no better place for your coffee than Va Bene."}
{"text":"Review of Service, Food, Ambience, and Price!

Would I go back? YES.

Do not expect a smile when entering. They were not busy as only one person was in line. If you engage them however they won't be rude. Service was fast.

I love Va Bene's modern chic look. I will atest to the chairs not being particularly comfortable, but everything else from sleek marble counters, to the red color scheme, made me want to take a dozen pictures.

I had the Caramel Éclair, Vanilla Tart, and a Caramel Apple Gelato. First of all, the pasteries look gorgeous, and happen to taste just as good. The éclair was heavenly. The gold chocolates on top were not merely decorative(unlike the gold flakes), but tasted like European chocolate. Everything was absolutely delicious top to bottom. The tart was equally as good. The gelato I will continue to crave for eternity. It was tart, and had no strange after taste like one you'd get from artificial flavoring. The caramel was lucious and made for a dense spoonful of bliss.

The most complaints come from it being to expensive, and I'd agree if I could get the same quality desserts from somewhere cheaper. I believe it's still worth trying (I'm only vouching for the sweets!)

All in all, I could eat 7 of those éclairs, and a gallon of their gelato. Service, meh. Definitely a cute little spot to try."}
{"text":"Just had a coffee and cheese Danish from here while staying at the cosmopolitan. Seriously one of the BEST cheese Danish I've ever had, however it is very pricey (but what isn't in Vegas)."}
{"text":"I'm always up for something new and va Bene is just that. When I want to treat myself to something sweet I satisfy my craving with a coconut mocha. It's the best! The Italian sodas are also good. Try the coconut cream soda. It was recommended to me by one of their team members and it is delish!!  Thank you va Bene you and your team rocks!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by Va Bene Caffe, a coffee shop inside The Cosmopolitan, for some gelato. We ordered a scoop of the tiramisu gelato, which was $5.41 w/tax. To get a waffle cone was $9 plus tax. The texture of the gelato was quite good--smooth and creamy--but the flavor was somewhat lacking, weak without any depth. The cafe has extremely limited seating, and fortunately we arrived on a slow weekday afternoon and found a seat.

For the price, even though this is Vegas, Va Bene Caffe is so-so."}
{"text":"This place is tiny, on the first floor of the Cosmopolitan, but if you happen to pass by, don't overlook the BEST croissant I ever ate!  The Nutella croissant.  They also have exceptional cookies and very good almond croissant. Although some may feel it's too sweet.  I regret finding this place on the last day of our trip, otherwise I would have tried everything!"}
{"text":"OH MY CHAI!  ridiculously overpriced, hands down BEST chai tea EVER!  I also love that the managers are always on the line taking orders and making drinks!  THAT is teamwork!  Nicely done!"}
{"text":"We eat here every time we stay at Cosmo. Unfortunately the Cosmo doesn't have a lot of dining choices so we frequently grab a sandwich and salad from Va Bene and its always great!"}
{"text":"1.5
my flight was delayed so everyone was going to do wicked spoon lunch after checking out from our respective hotels..i didn't think i was going to make my flight after seeing the long line at wicked spoon so opted to catch a cab.. my friend was adamant about getting me a bite to go (i didn't eat much during my entire trip)

ordered:
-prosciutto panini: this was ok, wished there were more slices but it started to get really salty halfway through
-iced chai: love chai so this was good and refreshing 

if i was going to get an overpriced panini i'd rather go back to jean philippe bc it was slightly more filling.."}
{"text":"$20 for 2 cups of Coffee!! Ok, No problem.
Coffee was moderate tasting at best. 
The order takers, However gave us The Caca face barely cracked a smirk and to add to my disappointment assumed what type of roast I wanted.
The (african-american young lady)cashier was very nice and courteous. But the blond heavy set woman that took our order is the reason why I downloaded the yelp app to give you this review. I don't bother to give reviews but I'm so utterly irritated. Thank You.
This was Sunday 11/9/14 @11:00am."}
{"text":"These guys have an espresso kiosk on the second floor of the West Tower. All I want in life in the morning is good coffee without any trouble, and that kiosk fits the bill admirable. Perfect latte, good blueberry muffin and kind staff. They'll get my morning trade anytime."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick ice cream treat for the little while we were taking a stroll through the Cosmopolitan. 

It's very small, with roughly four tables for seating.  

It's pretty pricey for gelato at $5 per scoop.

The staff were not the friendliest.  They weren't even busy and they were still grumpy!

I expect to pay more at a place located in a resort or a casino; that's understandable.  And I suppose most people take their beverages on the go, so seating may not be an issue most of the time.  But... grumpy staff make me grumpy.  You can find gelato just about every time you turn around in Vegas so next time, we'll give someone else a shot."}
{"text":"Located on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, my husband and I decided to grab an afternoon snack on Christmas day (surprisingly all the stores/ shops are open on this day). We ended up getting:

Kale salad, $8 prior to tax- This comes in a 16 oz container, but because I was sick, I asked if it would be possible to have it split into 2 containers. The employee who took my order said she could do that for me (which she did). This salad was really tasty, I especially liked the pomegranate seeds for the added sweetness and the citrus dressing. The kale itself was hearty and fresh tasting. 

My husband liked his portion of salad as well. 

16 oz Mocha, $6.50 prior to tax- I did not have any of my husband's drink but he did like it and thought it tasted like a standard mocha drink.

--------------------------
(Total= $15.67 after tax)

Our transaction was easy and pretty quick. My salad was given to us after we made our order. But for our drink, we had to wait to have it made. One thing that I did not like was that they never said our name or call out the drink name once it was made. The employee who made it just placed it on the counter and walked away (where anyone else could have taken our already paid drink). But because we sat inside (seating is limited, there is also some seating outside), my husband was able to watch so that he could get it as soon as it was ready.

Overall, a convenient place to pick up something to eat (they also sell sandwiches and a few other salads, along with pastries) or drink (they also provide bottled water with the Cosmopolitan logo on it for free) while you are gambling your money away."}
{"text":"Pricey but good.
When it comes to coffee I'll take expensive over cheap.  They use illy espresso not cheap Starbucks crap.
I love their white chocolate iced latte. Perfect stop for hangovers or a pick-me-up before hitting the craps tables.

The staff is very nice and understands how I like my coffee."}
{"text":"Their biggest strength: The tea and hot chocolate we got was boiling hot and stayed hot for almost an hour!  Really great for those who like their drink piping hot, but it made things a little difficult to sip without burning your mouth.

The Mud slide cookie was like a walnut brownie on the slightly dry (not fudge-like, but not crumbly either) side, but had a good flavor.

The fancy manchego cheese Danish was delicious, with a chewy pillowy texture.

There's not a lot of places to sit down that aren't part of a bar, sadly."}
{"text":"When I stay at the Cosmo i always come down here for coffee in the morning.  They have very good service, the girls at the front are always patient while I make my decision.  The coffee has been smooth and slightly above average.  The only thing i don't like is that they take forever to complete your drink- whether it's 1 or 5, I have always waited 7-10 minutes for my drink.  
They also have the BEST nutella gelato."}
{"text":"Nothing is va bene at Va Bene... except their croissant is passable. 

We usually stay at the palazzo when we go in big groups and I'm used to getting a perfect coffee and PERFECT croissant from Bouchon Bakery every morning when I'm in Vegas.

This time around was a smaller group so we opted for the Cosmo. I love this casino... but am VERY disappointed in Va Bene. NON VA BENE.

First, it took me repeating my order multiple multiple times for them to get it all. The drinks were a little complicated but nothing an experienced barista couldn't handle:

Small iced vanilla latte, regular milk, 1/2 the vanilla syrup
Small almond milk cappuccino

This took a little longer than desired but understandable. The 1/2 syrup throws some people... I guess...

Then I said, banana, OJ, plain croissant. THIS was where they got confused. Multiple times.

Then the cashier who was standing right next to the person taking my order and just waiting for me was NOT listening and I had to repeat everything AGAIN for the 10th time to just pay.

Whatever... they looked super tired and maybe that's it. Though I would imagine they work at a cafe... they should be expecting a crowd in the mornings.

Then as I wait for my order at the side, the woman bringing my food items CRUSHES my croissant between her arm and her boob. I mean... DUDE.... make two trips or put the croissant on top of the other customer's boxed order.... there were other options other than crushing the ONLY thing passable about va bene.

The croissant surprisingly was very flakey and had that fermented flavor. I will give them that.

Then the latte comes which I cannot verify in terms of quality.

Then I wait. And then wait. And then wait as three customers who had bigger orders and were after me came and went.

THEN I get my cappuccino. I leave and get to my room. Take a sip of this long awaited caffeine goodness and BLECH. It tastes basically BURNT. 

After last night's perfect cup from Scarpetta.... this tasted like cigarette ashes.

WORST."}
{"text":"I recently went back and was a bit disappointed  - the croissants were not as great/fresh as they were before.  Hope that they will work on it, since this used to be my favorite place for breakfast & croissants.  They are still better then other places, so it's worth a try...."}
{"text":"I stopped in twice here during my three day stay at the Cosmopolitan. The first stop was unexpected because I didn't realize that this hotel has a coffee/cafe shop, so when I saw gelato, I had to check it out. I got a small scoop of the Nutella gelato... Ahhhmazing :) 

My second stop consisted of 3 min before I had to be on the shuttle back to the airport, so I didn't really pick and choose what I wanted. I grabbed three desserts  - a Chocolate cannoli, a delish looking cheese danish for the bf, and a raspberry tart pastry. Three pastries equaled to about $15, which is wayyyy too much for my liking. But due to its incredibly convenient location next to all the restaurants and stores on the 2nd or 3rd floor (don't remember), I give this place four stars rather than three. Also, everything I did try, was incredibly delicious and fresh. 

I hope my next stay in Vegas will be at the Cosmopolitan, because honestly, it does NOT get better than that, so I will def be back to Va Bene for a quick bite to eat, or just some cold gelato to cool off in the heat!"}
{"text":"My BF and I stayed at the Cosmopolitan the last time we were in Vegas.  Of course, coffee was the first thing on our minds in the morning and Va Bene is the only coffee house at the Cosmopolitan.  No biggie, right?  

Wrong.  Two coffees (one drip and one iced--literally, just iced, not a latte!) and an egg panini cost us $23!  After that, my BF was in a pissed off mood.  He couldn't believe we just spent THAT much on a breakfast sandwich (we shared!) and two coffees that would've been a 1/3rd the price at a Starbucks.

Skip this place.  Go outside, cross the street, and get your coffee at 7-11."}
{"text":"Amazing roasted beet  salad marinated with vinagrette and mixed with mandarin oranges and red cabbage.   Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Super pricey! Wow!

I know this place is the only coffee joint in The Cosmopolitan, but are you serious?! Seven to Eight bucks for blended drinks?! Crazy stuff.

To top it off, the coffee and pastries are average at best. I would say Starbucks at a different hotel is a better bet. If you want great coffee, head over to Palio at the Bellagio!"}
{"text":"A good option for an iced coffee when the line at Starbucks is staggeringly long.  Nice selection of baked goods from croissants to muffins to cinnamon rolls.  They even have an Arnold Palmer on the menu."}
{"text":"$3.50 for a cup of tea????? I know this is Vegas, but I didn't realize hot water was a commodity."}
{"text":"Eh - I know I shouldn't expect too much from a cafe in casino, but still - this place lacks. I've tried it twice now. The first time was while we were waiting for our room to be ready. The line was ridiculous, so we watched it and went over when it finally looked like it had died down. 

The chai latte - awful. Just awful. I don't know if it was the spice or bad tea or what - but I had to choke it down and eventually just threw it out. The chocolate chip muffin was adequate, but nothing special. 

Decided to give it another try this morning - stopped by at 7:15am and there was only a small line. Too bad I stood in it for 5+ minutes before I could even order. When I finally did, it was another 5 minutes before my coffee was ready. And the coffee is awful. White chocolate mocha latte - totally bland, almost burnt tasting. Just not good. 

And of course, since it's a casino - they charge you an arm and a leg for slow service and sub par drinks. But that's on me - I could make a little effort to walk to Starbucks."}
{"text":"This little cafe is the perfect go to if you just arrived at the Cosmo to check in and are starving! Just keep walking Down the hall after you check in at the front desks, and the cafe is located on the left. I actually stopped here to ask if the Cosmo had a food court like at Caesars and the employee was super polite and friendly. The closest food place would have been down the street and I was dying of hunger after my flight. They serve lots of different salads, panini/sandwiches, and pastries here! And lots of drinks and coffee as well. My turkey panini was delicious and was $13.. Kinda pricy.. But the paninis are huge, so I had them cut it in half and it became two meals for me :)

The water and drinks here are a bit pricy too, so if you're really thirsty and just want a little cup of water for your panini without having to order a whole water bottle for a couple dollars, just go to the bar right before the cafe, and they have a little dispenser on one of the bar corners with chilled water and cups that you can get! Free! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after feeling screwed the day before paying almost $20 for 3 very mediocre MINI pastries from the Cosmo room service.

I had pretty low expectation looking at the overall 3-star ratings here on Yelp. Got the Panettone, chocolate croissant, and plain croissant (told you I'm a tubby at heart). Also got the Vanilla Latte with Almond milk and was pretty excited about this because I'm lactose intolerant and Almond milk tastes better than soy. 

Got my latte, drank it, and was disappointed right away. Not enough vanilla (I asked for more), and just watery. The beans are probably on the \"greener\" side, because even though the latte didn't taste like much/\"watery\", it had a LOT of caffeine in it. I would give a 1-2 star for the latte experience.

The pastries, however, was BOMB. I was very surprised, especially considering my standards for croissants are pretty high, always comparing with the best croissants I had in Paris. Va Bene makes croissants truly like the French. Perfectly flaky on the outside, super yummy buttery and moist on the inside. 

Highly recommend their plain and chocolate croissant here for breakfast."}
{"text":"Snazzy coffee shop in the Cosmopolitan.  Stopped by here to pick up a latte (for me) and blueberry muffin (for the kids) to snack on while we waited in the monstrous line for Thanksgiving Wicked Spoon.  

Nothing spectacular about either item and very comparable to a Starbucks.  Latte lacked a thick foam on top (so it was basically just hot milk and espresso) and the muffins were just meh.  But they did the job in staving off the hunger pangs that we all suffered from in that long LONG buffet line...  At least you don't have to walk too far for a coffee."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much a breakfast snack shop. I think it might be open 24 hours but not sure. I was staying at Cosmopolitan and was looking for a little bite to eat for breakfast. I ordered two almond croissants and 2 waters and it came out to $20! This place was too pricey for what it was. All there is in the menu was breakfast things. Not sure why it is open 24 hours then and they don't add more food to their stand.

I would recommend trying to find other places to get food than this because this is way to pricey for what they are selling. If you're desperate and need something to drink/eat and can't find anywhere else, then go here. I won't be coming back here and will walk whatever distance I have to to get my food/drinks."}
{"text":"If the people here could get anyone's name correct on their order that'd be great. I was called Cathy and Karen. Not even close. Another woman was named Lisa but her food came out under the name Jen. What??? It makes picking food up when it's called very confusing. First morning we wanted bagels but they were all out. Settled on the egg sandwich on a croissant. Greasy and the eggs were literally a block telling me they're pre made and then heated up but it wasn't bad. And considering the price it was one of the better options in the hotel. Drinks however were a rip off. Go to Starbucks if you're willing to pay that much."}
{"text":"Va Bene is the only café I know that manages to screw up Illy. Not good.
Here's a list of food items I tried (but will never touch again):
- A horribly salty and greasy prosciutto & cheese sandwich with pesto on a tasteless bun
- Blueberry muffin on steroids 
- Heavy, faux-éclairs that in no way resemble the delicious, cream-filled choux-pastry delights I love

Va Bene is pricier than Dean & Deluca in my building in Manhattan while it consistently disappoints. Definitely not \"va bene\"."}
{"text":"YUMMY!

This was the perfect quick breakfast place for my friends and me. They have coffee, pastries, orange juice, gelato, macaroons and other sweets. I ordered the cheese danish and I think I cursed out loud. (Which I think I'm prone to do when eating something delicious.) 

Don't make a special trip but certainly stop by if you're in The Cosmopolitan around breakfast time. 

To whomever made that marscarpone cheese danish? I want to meet you and kiss you on the mouth."}
{"text":"Va Bene is a nice italian coffee house. They know how to make a proper cappuccino with a lovely head of foam. They also have a nice selection of fresh pasties. They also have a few breakfast sandwiches that are tasty. I ate breakfast here a couple of times on my last visit to Vegas and made a couple mid-day stops for a quick double shot of esspresso pick me up."}
{"text":"Had a good egg and martadella sandwich here! It's unique and modern little cafe, great to get some coffee and a quick bite."}
{"text":"This is a cute little coffee and gelato shop located in the Cosmopolitan. $9 for 2 scoops of gelato in a waffle cone was pretty steep, but all you need to know is that their straciatella flavor is amazing. Another thing is that I usually love Pistachio flavored things, but their pistachio gelato tasted more like peanut butter...

I didn't try get to try the coffee that day, but perhaps next time?"}
{"text":"$8.92 for one Large Iced Vanilla Latte.  The coffee was very good and enjoyable but the baristas were rude.  They need some friendlier folks working this little place."}
{"text":"Ever since they opened the Starbucks in the hotel, this place is less crowded. Which for me is a God send, because waiting 15 minutes at the Starbucks in the Cosmo is painful for me after a night of partying. They brew illy coffee here, and their sandwiches are delightful as well."}
{"text":"You know those small coffee makers inside mediocre hotel rooms that come with the cheap packaged coffee? Well that coffee is better than the coffee here. Not to mention it's super expensive. I also tried their pasta salad and their caprese mozzarella salad, bland and boring. Stick to whatever is in your hotel room..."}
{"text":"Love their breakfast panini sandwich it doesn't disappoint! Large enough for 2, and has egg, cheese, prosciutto, and pesto served on toasted sourdough! Yum! The line can be long to grab one but goes very quickly! They also have pastries, coffees, smoothies, desserts and more! If you're watching your wallet, kinda pricey!"}
{"text":"Coffee and desserts. Overpriced for both. 
IIly coffee served here, with seasonal treats including pastries as well as gelato options nothing that really stands out. Expect a large drink to run you $8 simply because there are no other caffeine options in the Cosmo. Service was nonexistent. Chairs are extremely uncomfortable."}
{"text":"While our stay at the Cosmo I purchased 2 small mochas (a regular and a coconut made with soy) and 2 muffins (bran and apple cinnamon) in the morning for Hubs and I. 

The staff was friendly and helpful. Order was ready quickly and correctly. They serve a small selection of pastries, parfaits, pre-made sandwiches, gelato and fruit.

The mochas turned our great and the muffins were fresh and delicious. 

A little over priced but to be expected in a hotel (paying for convenience) Overall it is much better compared to the nearby Starbucks. My total with tax was $23.24. 

Decent place to grab a good coffee and a quick bite."}
{"text":"Strictly rating the Italian breakfast sandwich. We thought it was delicious and a great option to split between 2 people for breakfast on the go. More expensive than Eggslut. Preferred Eggslut cold brew coffee to their iced coffee."}
{"text":"Slow service and coffee is very bitter with a strange after taste. Take the walk to Starbucks instead."}
{"text":"For a quick bite to eat, this place really hits the spot.  After not eating for literally the entire day and walking the floor of the CES, I came here for a relatively inexpensive fast meal that I could take back.  Thinking I was incredibly hungry, I ordered two sandwiches - the Italian and a chicken parm, as well as a cannoli.   

Eyes truly bigger than my stomach, I could only eat half of each sandwich and was sufficiently stuffed.  Chicken parm though, really delicious.  Don't hesitate to order it.  

I could do without the Italian and the cannoli.  The cannoli in particular was way too sweet.  

Also have good-looking gelato and lots of coffee options, though I'm not a coffee drinker (gasp!) so I couldn't tell you about it."}
{"text":"I always love to get a fancy cup of coffee whenever I'm in Las Vegas. There is usually one fancy coffee shop at each one of the resorts. There are actually very few that I have not tried, at this point. When I saw Va Bene, I was very excited to try the coffee there in the next day. When I approached the register, the lady was very confused by my questions. I couldn't tell if it was a cultural difference because she was not American, or if she was just being rude. It put a bad taste in my mouth, figuratively before I even placed my order. I wanted to know what kind of roasts they had. I wanted to know my options. I guess that was a confusing question. She said \"we just have our  roast\" I said \"ok, well then I'll have that.\" My fiancé and I each ordered a medium cup of coffee and split the turkey Panini. For two large coffees it was $9.50, but what I thought was cool is that if you keep either your coffee cup or your receipt - you get free refills all day. That makes the $4.25 coffee a little more justifiable. The coffee is pretty good, but the turkey Panini is really what to write home about. It's absolutely delicious. I really wanted to go back the next day and get their breakfast Panini. That will be for another time since we tried Eggslut instead. Review on that later. Overall, aside from the odd confrontation at the register, this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"Best hot chocolate in the world. Every time I'm in Vegas I go there just for a cup. It's always the perfect temperature, perfect sweetness, and perfect kiss of chocolate. I usually get Dutch Bro but this is waaaaay better. In the winter people are always looking for a place to get hot chocolate get it from here."}
{"text":"I only tried the croissant.... And it was soo good! So flaky and buttery... The outer shell was crispy and then inside was so soft and velvety. Yummmmmm I want some more"}
{"text":"My second review as a resident of Las Vegas and my first stop of my coffee house hunt, located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo (same floor as marquee) it was JUST OK, Va Bene uses illy beans which isn't my preference (Hakimer , intelligentsia) but it turned out okay.

I ordered a medium iced coffee at $5.60 with tax (nevada has a state tax of 8.1% for beverages and food, BOOOO..) pricey even for LA standards.. 

on to the next one, can i get some recommendations for coffee houses on and off the strip??"}
{"text":"For what we just paid for gelato, the least the red headed cashier lady could do was smile. This is Vegas, capital of the service industry.  She scooped my friend's gelato and filled it up about 2/3 of the way while my scoop from the guy was all the way to the top of the cup.  There's no consistency.  The customer service by the staff here at Cosmo so far is sub par.  This visit occurred today 11/10/14 @ ~2:15 pm.  Manager needs to pay the staff more or hire friendlier staff."}
{"text":"The taste was a 3 star, but $6.49 for a 16 oz iced vanilla soy latte? Really? Definitely minus one star for the ridiculously expensive prices. I could have gotten 2 drinks at Starbucks, and taste isn't much different either."}
{"text":"Not to damn Va Bene with faint praise, but I will say that this was the least disappointing place I ate at in Vegas.  Coming from the Northeast and marrying into an Italian family, I've had a lot of excellent gelato in my day.  While Va Bene is not quite on par with that, it was pretty close.  I had a scoop of nutella and a scoop of coffee with white chocolate crunch.  I thoroughly enjoyed both.  I also got coffee from here a few times.  It was fresh and delicious every time.  If you need a quick, good cup of coffee, or a snack, not a bad place to go."}
{"text":"Amazing almond croissants! Crispy and sweet on top and soft and creamy on the inside. Paired with delicious illy coffee! Great place for breakfast, late night snack...you can also add alcoholic shots to your coffee! :-)"}
{"text":"I loved this cafe!  It reminded me of the newer, more modern caffès throughout Italy -especially one in the a train station in Roma.
Drinks were expensive, but not as expensive as most non-starbucks coffee options on the strip.  I loved that their black and white mocha was named a 'chiaroscuro'.
The espresso was great quality. 

HOWEVER, they do not offer soy or any non-dairy 'milk' options- so my lactose intolerant friend missed out on a yummy drink. And that was pretty frustrating. 

So if you don't need some sort of espresso/coffee drink with soy milk, then I would definitely recommend stopping by Va Bene."}
{"text":"$8 for a small coffee that tasted burned and an iced tea with very little ice, cloudy and a TON of attitude when I requested lemon. Awful."}
{"text":"Great place to have coffee. Great cookies as well. O would recommend to stop here and have a quick refresh.  Great service.  For sure will be back here"}
{"text":"Cost is high but you get great service and its about the location as well.  Your in one of the nicer hotels so don't expect not to spend some money on breakfast.  Coffees are kept fresh and when you ask for a triple shot they do not short you like a few other places... Worth it."}
{"text":"Heather was super sweeeeeeet and accommodating. She greeted us with a huge bright friendly smile and gave us whichever samples we asked and even made suggestions for us. Thank you for making our quick stop memorable"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a cup of coffee while at the Cosmo. During our stay at the cosmo, instead of spending boat loads of money on room service for coffee, we'd grab the large cup of coffee here and go back to our room to enjoy it before getting the day started. Good service, friendly people."}
{"text":"Cosmo has this shop and Starbucks. I like this place better. This is a great place to grab an easy bite, snack, coffee on the casino floor. No vegan options but there is 2 vegetarian options. Keep receipt on coffee, get a free refill same day. The little desserts are really good but messy. Can charge to room but it seems I get cur in front of slot here. I am disabled and use a walker and it never fails at least 1 person cuts in front of me each time, cashier eager to serve them."}
{"text":"Va Bene offers a lot more than coffee and is a great spot to check out for coffee and...broccolini? Yeah, fresh, garlic-punched broccolini. 

On separate occasions, I indulged in an iced coffee, mini cookies, plain coffee (now with soy available!) and on pizza night, headed over for a side of broccolini for a nice side of roughage.

Overall, great service and a beautiful addition to the shoppes and the Cosmo. The coffee is smooth and the perfect pick-me up while in the area."}
{"text":"Gem's Addiction!

Va Bene Caffe is an Italian cafe/bakery located in the The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, NV. There are 2 locations, one on the 1st floor near the casino & the other is on the 2nd floor next to Holsteins Shakes & Buns.

Va Bene offers a variety of pastries, donuts, cookies, muffins, macarons, salads, sammies, paninis, and an array of hot & cold beverages & a variety of coffee/caffeinated drinks. The 2nd floor location is a storefront and also sells gelato & has limited seating available. The 1st floor location is just a kiosk and doesn't have seating or sell gelato but has everything else.

Va Bene serves up breakfast & lunch sammies/paninis & other quick foods, but I only tried some of the bakery items, the gelato & of course the coffee, but the salads & sammies looked fresh & good! 

FYI: Va Bene has a stranglehold on the coffee biz at The Cosmo. It's the only place you can buy a cup of coffee, no Starbucks or other coffee shops on site like at Caesar's Palace :-(  So being a person that drinks coffee at any given hour, 24-7 & am cranky without it, I quickly became a regular at Va Bene during my stay at The Cosmo out of necessity.

I'm not a complicated coffee drinker & I never get the fancy coffee drinks with all the goodies in it. I just like my coffee strong & black & really hot! So as long as the coffee meets this criteria, I am a happy glamper. The coffee at Va Bene was good & hot but a medium, black coffee was a lil pricey at almost $4, 4-gems!

FYI: There are no coffee pots in any of the rooms or suites in The Cosmo, so unless you wanna cough up $25 for a \"not so big karaffe of coffee\" via room service every morning that you are too lazy to make the hike down to Va Bene, then you better put on your walking shoes & throw on a hat! My laziness cost a cool $50 plus tips! But in my defense, I didn't have to ride the elevator all the way down to the 1st floor in my jammies from the 36th floor aka \"cost-convenience analysis\" people! 

On to the sweets...Va Bene offers a few free of gluten bakery items, and I tried the gluten-free, mudslide walnut cookie & the gluten-free, mixed berry muffin. The gluten-free Mudslide walnut cookie was chewy in the middle but with crunchy edges. It had a rich, dark chocolate taste with chopped walnuts baked inside it. It's not a soft cookie, but it's tasty. It cost $4.50 but is a decent-sized cookie, 4-gems!

The gluten-free, mixed berry muffin was a mixed bag. It was soft in the middle with a nice berry flavor, but the muffin top was really hard. In fact, I cut it off & didn't eat it. (I hate hard muffin tops!) The muffin was good sans the hard top. I paid $5 for said muffin but ate only $2.50 worth of it.

The chocolate croissant only had a lil schmear of dark chocolate inside of an overly dense shell. I was hoping for a lighter, flakier croissant with a lil more chocolate inside...$5, Schwing & a miss!

One macaron will cost you $3 a pop. I got 1 tiny raspberry macaron. It was a cute, purple, airy, lil, bitty taste o'berry & down in 1 bite! Good but one & done! 

Finally, my fave dessert/snack at Va Bene was the Irish Coffee gelato. The only other thing I love as much as a cup o'hot coffee is a cup o'premium, yummy \"gemlato\" to pair with said coffee, rain, snow or shine! A small scoop o'gelato in a cup will cost you $5, but I thought it was a pretty generous scoop. There aren't a whole lot of gelato flavors at Va Bene but sampling is allowed & I definitely think Irish Coffee is the best flavor there. If you've ever had an Irish coffee drink, it tastes just like that but in smooth, creamy, thick gelato form. It tasted gemtastic with my regular, house-blend, black coffee, 5-gems!

So if you're stayin' or playin' at The Cosmo and you need a light breakfast, lunch, snack or jolt o'caffeine, take 5 & stop by Va Bene Caffe cuz it's bene good & you have no other choice! Yes as other yelpers complained about, you pay a prettier penny at Va Bene for your drinks & treats, but live a lil people, um it's not Dunkin' Donuts. Just remember, you're in Vegas for thrills & great meals NOT good deals!"}
{"text":"I loved nearly everything about the Cosmopolitan with the exception of this place.  I got the worst, most stale bagel I've ever eaten in my entire life here---it was essentially inedible and had to have been at least a few days old.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"Terrible drip coffee. Workers  don't want to be there. Only positive is their pastries. This place is just for convenience. I don't recommend. Your better off going to SB."}
{"text":"Probably the best croissant you'll ever have! As other reviewers have said, this place is not cheap (what really is in Vegas?) but the atmosphere is clean and bright. Service is friendly and efficient. Most bakery items in their case are about $5 each, including the croissant. I had a croissant two mornings in a row due to the amazing quality and taste. Very flakey on the outside, soft and buttery on the inside. For $5 it was gigantic and filling enough to hold me over until lunch at my convention. 

A friend I was with had the chocolate croissant twice and said it was also delicious. Another friend chose an egg filled breakfast panini ($14) and was not impressed. 

If you are looking for a treat for your tastebuds, enjoy a bakery item from Va Bene!"}
{"text":"ILLY COFFEE that means its good coffee.  Little Pricey but there is a price when you pay for good coffee..."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED!!!!! but....Delicious. 

This is not your ordinary cheap coffee shop. They have great tasting coffee and pastries but it's overpriced, especially if you are staying at the Cosmo for more than 3 days and you need coffee or tea daily as a quick picker upper. 

I ordered 1 coffee, 1 tea, 2 chocolate croissants and 1 yogurt parfait and the total came out to almost $35. Yikes"}
{"text":"Great strong coffee. At first I thought $5 for a large Americano was ridiculous until I was told there were 5 shots of espresso in it! 1 cup definitely did the trick, it kept me up all night. They offer soy, almond and coconut milk and truvia. I thought that was nice. Staff is friendly and if you're looking for a late night snack they offer delicious treats"}
{"text":"This place is nothing special.  Just a glorified Starbucks.  The cosmopolitan is pretty cool though."}
{"text":"Glad it is here.  Certainly a good thing to have in the hotel and I came here several times during my stay.  And it's just fine.  Not as efficient as a Starbucks.  Croissant not as good as Pret-a-manger.  Pineapple chestnut thing was tasty and light and the espresso coffees were just fine."}
{"text":"Va Bene caffe bar is located in the West Tower on the first floor. It's conveniently located near the check-in desk. They offer pastas, sandwiches, pastries, etc. along with coffee drinks.  So why the two stars? The small chai latte that I ordered was awful. It set me back $6. It was a cup full of bitter tea and left me as such. As my four year old nephew would say, this is BIDICULOUS! Yes, he says ridiculous with a B. 
Anyways, two stars for good service and the quick food variety. They could improve on quality considering the price point."}
{"text":"Three words....ITALIAN BREAKFAST SANDWICH.  I could not have asked for a more delicious and casual way to begin my days at the Cosmopolital Hotel.  This sandwich is from heaven.  Imagine it: sourdough bread, cheese, pesto, italian meats and a slightly runny egg (though I'm sure they will cook it more if you prefer).  Ridiculously delicious and big enough for two.

They also have amazing unique fruit salads for breakfast.  For example, we tried pink grapefruit with almonds, honey, and a few red pepper flakes for a surprising but yummy kick.  Sweet and hot all in one bite.

The coffee is Illy and it's also so smooth, rich and yummy...perfect to cure any hangover.

Though I didn't ty them, their assortment of pastries lookd beautiful as well.  Muffins, italian cookies, cannoli, breads...yum!

Now the joint isn't cheap but it's really good and better than so many alternatives in the hotel and on the strip.  We paid $23 for a coffee, fruit salad and a breakfast sandwich big enough for two.  :)  

Mangia"}
{"text":"On the way back from a breakfast special at Planet Hollywood, we passed this place on the way to the elevator leading to our room in the Cosmopolitan.  We saw from the mall area, a generous Almond Croissant that beckoned us by name and rifled through our pockets for the dollars and cents it would cost to buy it!  Hmmm....this was THE BEST croissant my husband and I have ever had and almond.......up the wazoo...best $5.42 we ever spent on a pastry."}
{"text":"Yes, the coffee is good.  However, $9 for an Americano is CRAZY.  The mark-up is out of control and you end up buying it because you don't want to actually sit at a restaurant, call room-service, or leave the building.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Although I didn't actually pay for the coffee myself, I know the price is far too expensive for what it was worth. 

I had a medium iced white mocha latte, and was really disappointed. The syrup to coffee & milk ratio was perfect which is usually hard to find, but the espresso shot itself was at best was a 15 second shot and tasted too bitter. 

Maybe i'm being a snot, but I'd much rather drink the illy coffee at work than go back here again."}
{"text":"Best food I've ever had from counter service. Salads are great, as as well as sandwiches. Not a restaurant by any means, but great for grab and go."}
{"text":"1 Double Espresso- $4.50. 

F!

Quality of the coffee was good and there's some nice space to chill. A good option if you really can't bear to leave the casino, but I think I'd rather have gone to Starbucks. $4.50, my god!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service, and they make a great ice chai with a shot of expresso with no questions....that is sometimes hard to find. A little expensive, $4 for a self serve coffee and $6.50 for a chai. This coffee shop has no place to sit so don't bring a paper or a computer. For me if the price was a little lower they would get 5 stars =)

{"text":"This place used to be AH-mazing with a long line out the door every time, ice cream, tons of pastries and coffee options. For some reason they are no longer on the second floor (Eggslut now occupies the space). They moved onto the first floor in the back of the casino near the check-in area. It is now a small walk-up counter with hardly any pastries and snacks, and no more ice cream. It doesn't have the cool look, and the coffee just wasn't that impressive. When it was upstairs, everything was better including the staff. With this downgrade of a location, I feel everything else downgraded with it. Bummer."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Convenient place to get coffee while staying at the Cosmo. Located on 2nd floor, near East Tower elevators. No line at the times I went. Employees were nice enough. You'll pay about $1-2 more than other coffee shops off the Strip, but that's not a surprise and not unreasonably high to me. A small mocha was about $5.50. Pastries were mostly around $5. I saw some panini offered for about $13 each. They have gelato and other items too. No big complaints here. I was just glad to find a place to get my morning caffeine."}
{"text":"This little spot was a pleasant surprise. We decided to go here for desert because we didn't want to spend more money at Comme Ca. The employees are friendly and happy to assist you in choosing out a flavor. We went with a white mocha latte which went down very smooth and had a rich flavor. We each had a scoop of the gelatto-- my girlfriend opted for the pistachio and i went with the chocolate chip and cream. Both very impressive-- I must say that the pistachio takes the cake because it had the strongest pistachio flavor of any ice cream i have ever had...anywhere. The chips and cream was buttery and delicious. The next time we're in the Cosmo we will probably be back for seconds."}
{"text":"The place is cute and convenient and it's nice to be able to sit in the nearby lounge area. However the prices are high for mediocre coffee. They serve the coffee scorching hot and it lacks fullness/body. The pastries and gelato are ok but it's so much better at the Bellagio."}
{"text":"Super convenient if you are in the Eastside Tower - take the elevator to 2 and you're practically dropped off here. 

They offer decent coffee and pastries at a hotel price point, with service that's fast and friendly. Coffee and espresso drinks are not that different in price point (about $5 for a large coffee or $7 for a large latte that contains four shots - latte, please.) Chocolate chip muffin was great, but I wish I could get the bagel with butter or strawberry jam or basically anything other than cream cheese. I also liked the nutella chocolate croissant ($5, same price as a reg croissant)."}
{"text":"Ever since a local cafe in good ol' Orange County got rid of my beloved chocolate croissants where the chocolate was uniquely baked into the dough instead of just stuffed inside a plain croissant, I've been on a quest to find a comparable chocolate croissant. I was staying at the Cosmo and walked by this little coffee storefront on the way to my room...and lo and behold, I spotted such croissants! I immediately ran in to buy one, and even though it cost a ridiculous amount, it was well worth every penny! The croissant was very flaky, and each layer had just the right amount of chocolate.

I also ordered a latte, but it cost almost $8 because I got a larger size and asked for soy milk. The latte was just okay and definitely wasn't worth the money. I would only come here for the chocolate croissants, but not for anything else, considering the pricing is so steep. I would much rather go to another coffee shop for everything, but the croissants! ;) 2.5 stars, rounded down for being a rip-off!"}
{"text":"After an Elite Yelp event I snacked on some pizza and washed it down with some mint chocolate chip gelato from Va Benne. They only have one size -- 2 scoops for $4.50. It was ok... not enough minty goodness and a touch on the bland side. Definitely not worth the calories.

They also had plenty of paninis and baked goods that looked pretty good. It's a worth a stop if you're looking for an inexpensive dining option at the Cosmo."}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian sandwich and a coke 17 bucks! Sandwich was just A-okay but I was super hungry so oh well probably would not go back for real food but ice cream looked good."}
{"text":"Sorry, but this place is ridiculous. If your charging me$5 for a bagel, I would think it would at least come with some good cream cheese, nope, just a little thing of old Philadelphia. Not even lite or flavored, just the original. And $5 for a small ice coffee? Come on, I know it's in a beautiful hotel, but that's absurd."}
{"text":"Delicious coffee, pastries, and sandwiches. There's two locations one on the first floor and one on the second floor near the east side towers.
What's nice about it is you can get free refills of coffee :)"}
{"text":"Over priced poor quality coffee......don't go here. They charged over $ 4.00 for their smallest generic coffee. It was very weak. Next time I'll walk further instead of to Va Bene."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad. I waited in line 30 minutes for a muffin and an Italian soda. Other customers were arguing with the cashier, thus holding up the line. When I get to the front I discover the cashier is completely clueless and the food was subpar. Starbucks has better pastries than this place. Starbucks doesn't charge $5 for a dry crumbly muffin."}
{"text":"Cafe is open really early, perfect for that pick me up after the night before... The Italian breakfast panini is really good! Great snack to have in between playing. And staff is relatively friendly and speedy."}
{"text":"Went to visit with a couple friends staying at the Cosmo. Upon my arrival they werent completely dressed, so I figured I'd head down and see if I could grab a quick bite to eat. 
This was the first place a spotted after getting off the elevator. Decided a sandwich would be great to soak up some of the alcohol I planned to drink. 
Its a tiny spot with a limited menu, but all I could see looked delicious. I choose the roasted turkey panini. I gave them my name and shortly after my order was up. I was tempted to play a little Wheel of Fortune as I waited.
I hadn't eaten since the night before, but I dont think it had any bearing on the fact that it was soooooo good! It was made with a cranberry bread that was so freaking delicious! I almost went back to get another, but I was headed to a pool party and didnt need the extra bulge in my belly"}
{"text":"The coffee is ok, of course being in the Cosmopolitan it was $6.50 for a Vanilla Iced Latte and $6 for an Americano.  Very pricey for what it is.  We would go to Starbucks next time, if for nothing else it is consistent.  Muffins and pastries are $6+ but look pretty good."}
{"text":"I got the Salted caramel peanut gelato because i LOVE caramel!! Very smooth, creamy, yummy, cold, and delicious. They also got affogato here."}
{"text":"$18 dollars for a med size black coffee small bottle of water and a cinnamon roll that was at least 3 weeks old.  I wish I could give negative star rating. This place is set up just to exploit hotel quests."}
{"text":"Basic coffee and espresso fix. Nothing worth mentioning. Unfortunate that the Cosmo doesn't have a much better coffee option."}
{"text":"It's Vegas.  It's not cheap.  But where else can you get a Jameson and coffee at 4 in the morning?  If you are hungry, take a look at their paninis.  Quality ingredients at an attractive pricepoint that will help soak up all the alcohol that you just consumed the night before."}
{"text":"Small latte + extra shot = $8.51
Served with too much foam after an exhaustive process of trying to get  two different employees to take my order correctly. 
Medium latte, whole milk, extra shot, 130, no foam.  
  It's not that complicated. 
After getting the first order written on the wrong size cup, skinny and never got across the 130° point, we started over.  
Right cup size, right milk, extra shot, temp understood - 
Handed off to the guy making the coffee.   
 I received a HUGE head of foam on a room temperature cup of coffee.  
  This was just one day, one cup of coffee.  
Here's the problem..... I want my coffee to be pleasureable and experience the moment as I begin my day.   Not start out irritated over an expensive and incorrect latte.
  The Cosmopolitan has ONLY one choice for coffee and this is it.   
I was here for a week in February and I'm here for five days now, in November without choices.  
As of today's visit, I have never once ordered my latte and gotten what I asked for.   NOT ONCE. Go somewhere else?  Sure - walk blocks along the strip searching for a coffee done correctly because the staff can't manage to listen to a simple order. 
   Very frustrating to say the least.  

Poor quality
Bad service
Too expensive"}
{"text":"Great little modern coffee shop to sit and have a snack.  We ordered some Macarons (French cookies) and some bottled orange and lemon italian sodas for the kids.  Nice place to stop and people watch.  It's located inside the Cosmopolitan near the shops."}
{"text":"I came here to get coffee to keep myself from passing out during the 1.5 hour wait in line for Wicked Spoon! Their coffee is nice, high quality. The fact that they are inside the Cosmopolitan gives you an idea that you will be spending more than at other coffee shops.

Be aware that they do charge 25 cents if you ask for a cup of tap water."}
{"text":"This coffee/bakery shop is inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel in a few locations. It is pricey, but it is good. The coffee is pricey but it is strong and awesome. The pastries are good and so is the gelato. 

Good place to grab something in the morning, dessert, or on your way home when you need to stay awake for the drive back!"}
{"text":"i liked the white chocolate espresso 
and italian breakfast panini"}
{"text":"Had the most basic drink: a small coffee.

But it was very tasty. I think it was Illy.  

However, I think that little cup of coffee was over $3.  But it is the Cosmo, so I'm not sure if you can find a cheaper coffee.   I think the lattes were over $5! and I don't think it comes with a gold leaf or anything.

There wasn't too much of a line so it was very quick, but when we left a huge group of people were in line, and depending on what they order, I have no idea how long it could take (e.g., gelato, sandwiches, snacks, etc).

Takes credit cards, so that was convenient.

If you're looking for a coffee, it's really not a bad option, just be prepared to pay for it, as if the coffee were made of gold."}
{"text":"It's food, and it's convenient. I guess at $8 for a cantaloupe salad and $6.50 for an iced chai, it still might be cheaper than the other food offerings in the Cosmopolitan. For me though, it was just a little too ordinary."}
{"text":"No.
walk away. 
the design and fanciness of this place makes me cringe. the staff here are sweet. i had fun bs-ing with them while ordering my coffees. i stayed at the Cosmo for a week and got coffee here 3 times only out of convenience. each and every time, a SIMPLE iced coffee and regular coffee taste foul and the grinds were in there. i also grabbed coffees for others at Va Bene Cafe, but their mochas, latte and coffee all had faults to them. 

I walked to Starbucks across the street at Planet Hollywood or even Walgreens will better suffice."}
{"text":"If you're staying at the Cosmo this is a good breakfast option. It's good and quick, which I like because it lets you get on with your day in Vegas. I did see that they also offer coffee and gelato, however, I can't comment on the taste of either of those options. The caffe is small, there isn't really a place to sit and eat/drink your purchase at this location, but it's near enough to other seating options.

Star #1: Flavorful food. Panini was good.
Star #2: Food causes cravings. No.
Star #3: Price worthiness. I feel like I have to scale my price worthiness on what's available in the area. It's $11 for the sandwich, which is a pricey sandwich, however, it's tasty and convenient. So yes, I feel like it's worth it for the convenience. You do have the option crossing the pedestrian bridge to the Miracle Mile area for cheaper food options.
Star #4: Decent service. Minimal interaction, but there were no incidents.
Star #5: X factor (ie amazing service, ambiance, creativity, etc). No X factor, but I'm going to mention that the decor is cute and it fits in nicely with the rest of the hotel."}
{"text":"This is short and simple review for all the coffee drinkers out there. A small watered down coffee for 7 bucks! I say just walk on over to the back of Cosmo and pick up a latte at the good old trusty Starbucks."}
{"text":"Very mediocre cafe.  There's a Va Bene upstairs and downstairs at the Cosmopolitan hotel in Vegas (where we stayed recently for my friend's bachelorette party).  I wasn't too impressed.  An average, somewhat dry croissant cost $5.  A bottle of water cost nearly $5.  And my friend's breakfast sandwich (which looked dry and old) cost her $13.  Thanks, but no thanks.  I'd only visit if I absolutely had to."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the casino of the beautiful Cosmopolitan. The lines can be a bit long in the morning. The lattes are delicious but the pastries look better than they taste. I go there anyway."}
{"text":"We were in the Cosmo and wanted a quick bite to eat.  From the reviews, I knew it'd be pricy but since we decided to split a sandwich and drink, $18 for the two of us didn't seem too horrifying.  We opted for the chicken parmesan sandwich and a blood orange italian soda.  The soda was excellent - a unique flavor, well balanced, and refreshing.  The sandwich was also excellent - high quality meat and flavorful breading....until we got more than two bites in and found it stone cold in the middle.  

The girls behind the counter seemed nice, but distracted and disorganized, and the place is obviously lacking in quality (temperature) control."}
{"text":"Yum!! so many pastries to choose from and they're big too unlike the teenie tiny ones from Starbeezy. Ordered the walnut croissant -- maybe it was almonds, idk it was nutty.

Anyways... conveniently located in Cosmo, affordable and the cups are bigger :)"}
{"text":"Only tried their caramel soy lattes here, but my friends tried other coffee drinks. I am not a  big coffee drinker but I am picky with coffee when I DO drink it and I think this place is OK.  We went here because we stayed at the Cosmopolitan and could not find a coffee bean or starbucks nearby. However, we were not disappointed, nor were we uberly-impressed. BUT their staff was exceptionally friendship and amazing and for that reason, I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Located in The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas Hotel Casino on The Famous Las vegas Strip. Ok, this place is ok. This is an \"Ultra Modern\" cafe, ultra modern is Italian for uncomfortable chairs. The prices are not great and the espresso was just ok, nothing fantastic, but it's not terrible, if you need a pick me up and happen to be in the area stop in. But there is better out there. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"I've been running around the Cosmo looking for a salad and this place popped up. I got the Caesar salad, but was a bit disappointed when I could add anything else to it. The staff was very friendly! If you're in a rush to grab some quick bite then I'd suggest coming here, otherwise spend your $10 on a Caesar salad elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great little spot for coffee at the Cosmopolitan, and near Crystals shopping area.  

Free wifi from the hotel (no log in page even).

Good for lattes.  Grad a croissant (chocolate for a quarter more), even though they are already $4 a pop.  Pretty large though."}
{"text":"This was my favorite place to get food at the Cosmopolitan. They had a selection of about four or five sandwiches that were all delicious or looked delicious. I ordered the Italian three times lol. My friends also enjoyed the Mediterranean veggie sandwich and some other sandwich that had chicken in it. Service was very friendly also. I'd give this place five stars if only it was a little faster. I feel like I had to wait at least five minutes or longer for my sandwhich which they just zapped in a super oven.. so that should take less than a minute. Oh well. It was super convenient and a good way to keep my blood sugar up."}
{"text":"Great for quick breakfast. Got a coffee, fresh OJ and cinnamon swirl with whip. Very rich and filling. The Fresh OJ was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars because of the great customer service I received from Rosie! Rosie thank you for being so sweet and going over and beyond. You made our experience much more than just a quick stop to getting some coffee."}
{"text":"Modern and up-to-date with digital menu boards, this bustling coffee shop in the Cosmo in Vegas has fabulous, friendly staff and a great selection of coffee, gelato, sweets and sandwiches.

I just had the $4 coffee, which was decent. Everything looked delicious though."}
{"text":"I'm only rating this place a 3-star simply because I had a great enough company with me to disregard the overpriced coffee and muffins I bought. The place, no doubt, has a great atmosphere. It leans more to the contemporary and trendy style but $5 for a really small cup of latte and another $4.50 for a muffin pushed it a little for me. Still, my friend and I were on the strip and like Disneyland, overpriced food was inevitable. We sat on the bar stools overlooking the lounge across the cafe. The service was really good, we had a cool, flamboyant cashier who was very accomodating. 

I'd say it was very smart of the Cosmopolitan to fit in a little cafe amongst the high end shops and glittery chandelier lounges but if possible, perhaps cutting back on the pricing could help garner more customers, not that there weren't a lot when we went. People were enthusiastically handing over their $10-20 bills for a pastry and drink. 

For the most part, keep in mind you'll ultimately be paying for the fancy atmosphere so not unless you're planning on staying in for awhile to chit-chat, go to the Mirage and get yourself a starbucks."}
{"text":"Not the best cafe on the strip, but very convenient in you're staying at the Cosmo. Their coffee is watered down and selections are limited. However, you can't go wrong with their to-go salads. Very pricey, but they're always fresh and tasty. My favorites are their grapefruit, kale/pomegranate and cantaloupe/fig salads."}
{"text":"Good coffee, nice pastries quick service nice atmosphere
Come here every morning and love it"}
{"text":"Bought chicken millines sandwich. Returned sandwich. Will not purchase or refund in the future."}
{"text":"The OJ is refreshing and delicious. I also had a chocolate chip muffin & fruit. All were tasty. A little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Convenient if you are already in the Cosmo. The croissants were fluffy and crispy on the outside

This smoothies are pretty decent as well"}
{"text":"CAUTION: Mild ranting to follow...

I went to this coffee shop after having just arrived to the Cosmo, our hotel, after a 5+ hour drive; thus, coffee was a necessity! :)

Anyway, I was happy they had almond milk, BUT dismayed by the price. $7 for a regular almond milk  hazelnut latte.  In addition, I asked for a cup of water and the barista tried to charge me $.25, so I said forget it.  The flavor of the coffee was fine, but it was nothing special.  After having Stumptown coffee in New York for cheaper than $7, this was a joke.  

I know Vegas is expensive, but there are other coffee shops that will probably be cheaper in Vegas.  Some cons, though, are that if you want a flavor shot or almond milk, they charge a lot more.  For hazelnut flavor, they charged me like $1.50 and then another $.50-$.75 for the almond milk, which added up to a ridiculous $7+! 

...end of rant.

Overall, not worth it.  I would venture across the street to the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. It is a bit pricey as well with flavor shots and non-dairy milk substitutes but at least they give you a 16 ounce beverage, instead of a double-the-price 12 ounce beverage.  If worse comes to worse...can't believe I am saying this...just go to Starbucks...at least you know the price is standard and what to expect."}
{"text":"Located on the first floor near the front desk and across the floor from Identity Membership. It's open 24 hours and served beverages and light food (similar to Starbucks). It used to be one of two locations, but since the arrival of Eggslut on Level 2, it is the only one.

My sister and I were recently on property for a short errand and stopped by for a quick coffee. I opted for a 16oz. Iced Coconut Mocha with Almond Milk ($6.50). I wasn't expecting anything amazing, but the coffee was delicious! A lot of places only serve soy milk as a milk alternative, so I was delighted to find almond milk. Anyway, deeelicious mocha that I really enjoyed and a good experience. I would totally stop by for the same drink again!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here to meet up a TX acquaintance who needed some coffee to revive himself at 5pm. I was headed back to SD so I wasn't looking for anything with caffeine in hopes of knocking out soon. They had several choices for smoothies and I opted for the Acai. It was pretty good - similar to what you'd get from Robeks. Since I've been on a dessert spree, the gelato caught my eye. We got the salted peanut on his recommendation and the pistachio. He was right, the peanut was tasty, although I wouldn't get the pistachio again."}
{"text":"You know you're in the right place when they start remembering you from day to day, and you've only been there 3 days.  Quick service and tasty drinks made me a happy customer.  I'll definitely go back if staying close by on a trip. While the prices might not be the cheapest, the service and taste of the items make up for it.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"So...the pastries are decent. (Read: pretty standard) the coffee is illys so it's decent better than most other coffee chains. Sadly the hot chocolate is not. It taste eerily similar to Hershey 's syrup with steamed milk. So it too sweet and and doesn't taste of cacao but rather of just sugar."}
{"text":"PART 1: boring breakfast
What a waste of money! $13 for a mediocre iced latte and a Danish? I ordered the Danish but was given A croissant. Sadly I was too far away to return it. Neither were worth the money and I think I could get the equivalent at a street cart

PART 2: gelato redemption
Have you ever thought, that Nutella is good it would be better As gelato? Me either, but I wish I had. It was perfectly flavored and went delightfully with mint crunch. The homemade waffle cone was not worth the extra cost.

2 stars for breakfast
4 stars for gelato
Average: 3 stars have the gelato but eat somewhere else"}
{"text":"Expensive but awesome food choices, I liked their cinnabon and macaroons."}
{"text":"After waiting nearly an hour to pay and line up for Wicked Spoon buffet, I ran over to Va Bene Caffe, in heels, at that, to satiate my growling tummy. 

Everything in Vegas is expensive, but this food was DARN good. I ordered the blueberry muffin on two different occasions. It's the first I've had with a crispy exterior and a soft interior. SOOO GOOD!! The hot cocoa is what we call \"CoCocaine,\" because it's sooo rich and delicious that it's addictive!

My server was so sweet and open with recommendations. I also love the look of the place -- very modern. You can't go expecting much, but a darn good snack. Yum!"}
{"text":"Good location in the Cosmopolitan and great service. The espresso was the perk I needed after an afternoon of walking the Strip."}
{"text":"I only got a caramel latte, it was delicious. Service was good too, she deserved a tip."}
{"text":"Best coffee on the strip! I come here a few times a week for a little pick me up pre-work. I never shy away from my usual iced mocha coconut (no whip) and will occasionally splurge on one of their delicious macaroons. 

The baristas are very friendly and work fast! I needed a pen my last time visiting and the barista happily let me take on of theirs."}
{"text":"Va Bene Caffé has a sophisticated sounding name.  It occupies prime real estate in the sexy and sophisticated Cosmopolitan.  It serves iLLy coffee, a much more sophisticated cup than Folgers.  At its heart, though, it's a coffee shop that serves coffee.  Roughly $4.50 for a medium-sized regular cup of coffee, black no sugar?  Sorry, but, I guess I'm not THAT sophisticated.  At least, it was hot and tasted good.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I'm all about continuous networking and building relationships with all sorts of people in all sorts of industries. When I had the opportunity to meet with a regional manager from Yelp, I didn't want to miss that chance. We both decided to meet up at Va Bene Caffe as she was staying at the Cosmo. 

When I walked into this place I was pleasantly surprised! For a coffee shop, this place was pretty stacked. You first notice the huge windows separating this cafe from the Cosmo floor. There's a red and black theme going on which gives that regal modern impression. There are high chairs and bistro table tops for seating. The was ok. They were nice when you asked for help, but didn't really offer it. 

This joint offers gelato, pastries, alcohol, coffee and tea. Pastries go for about $3-$5, coffees and teas around $3-$7 and cocktails for $12. On my visit, I got the large green mint tea for $5. They used 3 tea bags to make a dark green flavor accompanied with a lot of depth. Along with that, there was a prominent mint presence. The tea was made scalding hot though. I had to wait almost 10 minutes just to be able to enjoy it. 

This place is definitely a product of a strip casino. The look is modern, dramatic and totally consistent to what the Cosmo stands for. Through the glitz and glamour, it's just a regular coffee shop. When you're in the Cosmo, be sure to check them out. On my next visit, I'm going straight for the gelato!"}
{"text":"At 1am, yes, one in the morning....(Sunday night).....
Not only do they have excellent pastries, espresso/drinks and macarons (the French soft sweet cookies....not to be confused with macaroons which are the coconut cookies)--- 
the whole staff also have fabulous customer service....with a smile. Led by a great manager, Carlo, who talks to all his customers: politely and charmingly......
the rest of the cafes and bars in Cosmopolitan hotel should take a class from this VaBene team. We will definitely be back with all our friends! Thank you for the great midnight snack. ;)"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good cafe in the Cosmo hotel. I got an iced almond latte, wasn't the best and wasn't the worst. I liked the display of sweets, pastries and sandwiches - very appealing. I wish there were more sandwich options!!"}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for macaroons & spotted them in the pastry case. The service was great and the employees were very friendly and helpful! I had a great experience and the macaroons were fantastic! I will definitely stop in the next time I'm in Vegas! Macaroons were a tad pricey but you get what you pay for so I can't complain!"}
{"text":"Their Chiaroscuro Mocha is the best!! Sweet bold wonderful flavors in a cup!

This coffee shop fits right into the Cosmo, everything at this hotel is unique including this shop with the bright neon lights and electronic menu boards."}
{"text":"Good coffee and fun decor, but so pricey!! I guess that describes a lot of the businesses found within the Cosmo, sigh. As the hotel's only real coffee bar, the morning crowd here on a Saturday was pretty insane. I got a small Chirascuro (fancy name for \"black and white\") Mocha and it was like $6. I think a friend's regular drip coffee was like $4--which she had to go get herself from those dispenser carafes, I might add. I didn't try any of their food but their dessert and deli case did look amazing. Well the next time I feel like spending $20 at a coffee place I'll go back and try those items."}
{"text":"My friend, Amber, who works at The Cosmopolitan told me the Everything Cookie  is her favorite. 

I bought four. One for Amber, one for another friend, and the other two for me and my kid. 

Crispy at first bite, smooth and flavorful with each chew. Milk is optional. Dang!

The Everything is a favorite for all of us."}
{"text":"The coffee is fine, nothing spectacular, the same goes for the pastries. The lines move fast, though, which is a plus when you need that caffeine fix first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"Oh Va Bene Caffè... you have saved my exhausted Va Butt more times then you will ever know! 1) Rolling in from an long flight with a lay-over from H-E-double hockey sticks. 2) Partying all night Vegas style. 3) Shopping all day long like my AMEX is on fire and realizing dinner and a night out are approaching, and fast! 4) Partying all night Vegas style. 5) Partying all night and day Vegas style. 6) Well, this could go on, and on - you get the point. 

Basically, Va Bene has some of the best espresso on the strip that is guaranteed to wake yo' a$$ up!"}
{"text":"My husband and I bought 2 large coconut mochas. They were delicious and we bought them everyday we were in Vegas. The consistency changed a little bit thru the week, but they were still good. I would rather go here than Starbucks (a chain)."}
{"text":"Every time I am here at the Cosmopolitan, I'd stop by Va Bene for a scoop of coffee gelato. At ~$6 for a scoop, this place isn't cheap but the ice cream is rather delicious. You're not allowed to bring food into the Chandelier Bar but the waitress will make an exception for a scoop of gelato. ;)"}
{"text":"My cousin got the white chocolate mocha and I got the vanilla latte with a shot of hazelnut.  Not sure if she even got the right order and her drink was warm.  Mine however never came out.  I had to address it to them and they finally got it right.  My coffee was pretty good.  Just really dissatisfied with the service."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place in our hungover state. No wonder this place is only getting 3 stars! No one wants to pay $5 for a coffee/juice and wait forever on slow service when desperately seeking respite from the night before. Thought a pastry would be tasty sustenance for the morning, but the almond croissant was so... chewy. We sadly slunk back into our heavily-curtained room and gave up that morning."}
{"text":"There are 2 va bene caffes at the cosmopolitan. The one that serves gelato is in the 2nd floor near the chandelier. 

I got the pistachio gelato and it was sooo delicious. For sure going to get it again if I stay at the cosmopolitan. It was a bit pricey. I believe it was $5 for one scoop and $7 for 2 scoops. We got the 2 scoops and took out one scoop and put it in a cup when I got back to my room :)"}
{"text":"Great little snack spot inside the Cosmopolitan...they have a nice little assortment of various drinks and baked goods!

I stopped by here on a hot Vegas afternoon and tried out their Passion Fruit cream soda...

My initial reaction after the liquid hit my tongue was MEH, but after the second and third sip, it started tasting a lot better!

I also took a few sips of the orange cream soda that one of my friends ordered, but I still liked the passion fruit cream soda more.

If I'm ever in the Cosmo again, I'd definitely stop by and check out the other snacks here."}
{"text":"Very good Coffee. We were starving after our flight, so we both ordered the same Panini. The funny thing was that mine was extremely spicy and Diane's was very mild. We checked to see and we did have the same sandwich, so I am not sure why there was such a difference. Since Diane likes spicier stuff than I do we just switched sandwiches. It is an order at the counter kind of place, so access isn't an issue."}
{"text":"After drinking at Marquee on New Year's Eve, we tried to eat at the secret pizza place but the line was out of control, so we checked out this little cafe at 3am. It's  not cheap but it is the Cosmo. We got 2 paninis that were good, nothing spectacular, but what completely stole the show were the Mudslide Cookies! They were huge and packed with big chunks of chocolate and I believe macadamia nuts. I'm not usually into crispy cookies which these were on the outside but they were SO chewy on the inside. I am so coming back here for another Mudslide Cookie asap!"}
{"text":"The raspberry sorbet and the hot tea were great ! Staff are very sweet and gave good recommendations. I went to the one on the second floor and the line up there was a lot less long than the line at the site on the first floor during breakfast hours on Saturday.  Prices are decent. The staff move rather quickly to get you on your way. Overall I recommend to all !"}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service - great for grabbing a bite to go. Picked up a breakfast panini (the bread was very hard, ouch, but it was scrumptious otherwise), orange juice, and a cookie here. Kinda pricey but it was to be expected. There aren't too many other options in the vicinity so it's convenient that they carry the good basics. 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"This review is dedicated to the wonderful young woman with the glasses who was working the counter in the Morning on May 1. I bought coffee with points and later went back to get more coffee and drinks to take upstairs. She said she remembered me and that my second coffee was free as they have free refills with your receipt. the day before when I got coffee the guy with the beard didn't tell me that. So now I know as who doesn't love 2 cups of coffee in the morning!"}
{"text":"Even though the Cosmopolitan is filled with restaurants (and their awesome buffet!), I think it's pretty cool how they still manage to fit in a cute, little coffee/gelato shop.  Of course, it's still rather chic and modern like the rest of the hotel...but a coffee/gelato shop nonetheless.

After seeing their case of Panini's and sandwiches earlier in the day, I stopped off on my way to my room to grab a Chicken Milanese sandwich for dinner before heading back out for the night.  Essentially a breaded and fried chicken cutlet with a spiced tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, the sandwich was surprisingly filling but it was just okay.  I loved the melted mozzarella, but I got a tired of the sauce by the end (the spice kind of overpowered everything else).   While the chicken cutlet was fine for the most part, it kind of sucked how the breading started to get soggy by the time I got back to my room (the sandwich steamed itself during the walk from Va Bene to my room).  Hard to blame Va Bene for that one though.

Between the small Orangina and Chicken Milanese sandwich I had, my dinner was quick, but not really cheap for what I had ($13 or so).  Not all that shocking being the Strip, but there are better sandwich options nearby if you're willing to walk (JJ's at Paris or Earl's at PH).  Otherwise they aren't bad and offer plenty of menu choices for a caffeine fix to keep you going for the day.  Or night."}
{"text":"I was craving for something cold and icy, I asked the casino host for some advice and they show me up to this joint.

I got a blended cafe mocha, it satisfied my cravings but something wasn't quite right.  Didn't taste rich, needed more sweet.  Should of asked for some caramel.  

A tall cup is $8.30"}
{"text":"The staff are patient and helpful. I ordered the Acai, banana, berry smoothie and it tasted so horrible I threw it away. 

They also have coffees, Italian soda and some pastries, gelato and pre made sandwiches. There is limited seating but ok if you just want to grab something and go."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is shockingly expensive.  You really are paying for rent here.  Check out my receipt here and you will see how these people roll.  The pastries are good, the latte was good.  $6 good, uhhh, no way.  It would be IF it had liquor in it.  So this is definitely a 4 star place if it was 25% cheaper so I docked 2 stars because it is one of the most expensive lattes I have ever had in my life (so far).

So if you are staying at the hotel like yours truly, you have 2 options, bend over and get your coffee here, or hoove it elsewhere. Perhaps you might be able to score some coffee in the casino, but who knows how much they are going to gouge you."}
{"text":"Illy espresso made by robotic-like servers.   Espresso plus a barely edible chocolate croissant was close to $10.  The shop itself was sort of cool, in a chrome and 1980's GQ sort of way."}
{"text":"Good espresso coffee drinks.  There are locations on the first and second floors of the Cosmopolitan.

Because there aren't huge conventions and the shops are not located in major walkways, the lines for coffee in the morning aren't too bad compared to some of the other hotels, but the baristas seem slow and don't have a good system as people behind me got drinks before me.

That said, i think they are best with their sandwiches.  I highly recommend the Italian sandwich toasted if you are looking to not eat in a restaurant in the hotel.

My only beef is that the second floor location closes early.  They also have good gelato!!"}
{"text":"East coast time in the west coast a PIA , East coast time on the west coast on the Sunday where the time changes for spring Brutal.  So i set put to find some coffee that will help me become a marginally norma human being, hotel breakfast coffee was not going to cut it. Va Bene is located on 2nd and 1 st floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel. Since I was in the west tower I picked first floor lobby. Va Bene bless your soul for making an espresso based wake ip call and putting in it a to go cup for me. However i refuse to pay 7 dollars for the large one I am needy not desperate!!! So i opted for the small Latte still 5 dollars. I also tried their chocolate croissant because really what goes better with latte? Trick question nothing does."}
{"text":"I love the hazelnut latte here! There is almost always a line, but they are really efficient and move the line fast. 

I only had the hazelnut latte here, but they have tons of options and ice cream too!"}
{"text":"The three-stars is only based off of the spinach and egg breakfast sandwich I got from here. Swung through here on my way through the Cosmopolitan to grab a bite on the go. They had two breakfast sandwiches in the display, so I opted for the spinach and egg $13 dollars. 

The sandwich was served on sourdough bread with a square shaped egg with some spinach cooked in. I am definity not picky at all when it comes to food so it was not bad but nothing 4 or 5 star worthy of writing. They warm up the sandwich prior to serving to make everything warm and crunchy. 

If you're in a pinch or want to grab 'n go this place is that check-in-the-box for a quick refuel on coffee or snack."}
{"text":"Not a fan of italian pasta dishes, but i sure love their sandwiches!!

This italian coffee/gelato bar/shop is just around the corner near Cosmo's Marquee. It's easily passed by since it just a tiny store between restaurants and shops however. This place is IT!

I went here for a quick dinner prior to partying @ the Marquee. Service is decent, waiting time is not even there. Staff is nice, place is petite, nothing fancy, but then the food is delicious. Their sandwiches, as simple as they get are awesomely mouth watering. Don't have the appetite for ice cream but they're gelato looks yummy though i haven't tried it. 

Will come back here for a decent bang for your buck quick grub, if you don't wanna fall out of line to Marquee!!!!"}
{"text":"Love that they serve Illy coffee/espresso here. But the service and drink quality can be a mixed bag, with occasional sloppiness and rudeness from the manager on down. I am disappointed that they stopped carrying the Bombassant, their version of a cronut. That was an amazing pastry. All will be forgiven if they'd bring it back."}
{"text":"Open early and closes late. A very convenient coffee shop that serves panini, coffee, and pastries on the go. This is a great place for a quick bite before heading out. I had the chocolate muffin, nutella swirl croissaint, egg spinach panini, italian panini, lattes, and strawberry banana smoothie. It's about $60 total for all the above listed, but it's decent, above average good food. We are usually on the run to drive out to hike and this is the perfect place for quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Not that great:( very pricey! $40 for 2 small coffees 2 breakfast sandwiches, what do you do no Starbucks Cosmo:(  have to go there and pay the price! Coffee was very weak!"}
{"text":"Grape Fruit Salad!! Italian Breakfast Sandwich!! The Coffee!! All delicious! I ate the GF salad everyday! Yea it's pricey BUT so is this hotel.. So worth it! If your worried about the extra few $$. It's not for you. 

I still think about the GF salad daily. :)"}
{"text":"I came here at some awful hour of the day and was pleased they were open. I looked forward to the illy espresso and people watching, but was a little shell shocked when I saw the price for my latte. A medium latte came to $7. 

I paid the $7 and was very pleased with my drink. It was perfectly prepared and I had a nice conversation with a woman behind the counter. 

There were plenty of people on staff and busy for 515 in the morning. It was clear they were having fun with their job and were happy to be at their job. 

Although it's pricey, it comes with the territory. I enjoyed stopping by, being involved with the energy of the baristas, people watching in the Cosmo, and sipping my expensive latte."}
{"text":"I didn't go into the actual restaurant but I greatly appreciated the fact that they had a little coffee cart right by the elevators on the second floor so that I could run down in my pjs and grab a couple of lattes and pastry to bring up to the room.  On a related note, what's up with the Cosmo not providing coffee makers in their rooms?  In our suite, we had a fridge, a microwave, a dishwasher (I'm being serious) but no coffee pot. WTF?!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best croissant I've ever had. So fresh and flaky on the outside, soft and airy on the inside. And it's fresh regardless if you have it at 6am or 9pm. Trust me I had a few during my stay. Coffee is good too, a little overpriced but you get free refills for the rest of the day when you keep your receipt, why not!"}
{"text":"Impossible to get my coffee right even after returning over and over. I used to work on the property so I would come in often and even after a pricey coffee that included a discount it still would not live up to Wynn's standards. Never again."}
{"text":"Great oasis for a quick coffee break. Since it's located literally in the casinos there's no relaxing tables and chairs so be mindful of that. 
Food is decent. Loved the largest Palmier I've ever had. Wish there's a vegan menu."}
{"text":"My iced latte was mediocre and overpriced, I also had their version of a Cronut and that was pretty good, But my gripe here is with the staff, who are INCREDIBLY RUDE! Service matters, because it can ruin an experience no matter how good food can be. Everyone in the hotel has been gracious until my boyfriend tried to order a chai latte with soy milk and an add shot. The cashier kept interrupting him when he was asked to repeat his order not letting him finish his sentence because he was confused about the add shot request and spoke in a condescending irritated tone and practically rolled his eyes at us!   Service was so bad I felt compelled to speak to the manager because I was so appalled at how we were being treated and wanted to prevent others from experiencing this, unfortunately they were unavailable. The baristas saw this happening and I could tell they were uncomfortable with what was going on. 

I'll save my caffeine fix for Starbucks instead next time, sorry Cosmo you hired whack people at this place."}
