{"text":"Disgusting stopped in for schnitzel this guy doesn't have a clue I grew up in germany. Trying to make a quick buck off of bs. The meat tasted spoiled."}
{"text":"Good pastries and coffee.  I am excited to try an entree there sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Owner is greeting and friendly. The pastries are great. I gave 4 points because the food is kind of ok taste. Overall a nice place to spend with friends & beer on a nice evening...."}
{"text":"Just flew in from Denver saw the sign across from our hotel, homemade and delicious. Owner sat and talked with us. Great place"}
{"text":"What's up with the wait staff? I order veal goulash that came with a salad from the owner. Moments later he served me a  bowl of soup saying \"a big guy like you should be eating a bowl of soup, not salad.\" My mother who was with me began to laugh, so I ate the soup in good humor.

I thought I was getting noodles with my goulash which is standard fare. Instead he served my goulash with mashed potatoes exclaiming \"I was a big guy and should be eating goulash with potatoes and not noodles.\"  Later he attempted to make up for any confusion by bringing over a strainer of noodles that he poured on top of my goulash.  As we prepared to leave he gave us two free cookies. All said, the food was good despite the mix ups. I never received my salad."}
{"text":"How does this guy stay in business?? I have never had such an unpleasant experience. I went there three times and all three times he said he was from a different European country. I ordered coffee which stated was $4.25 and he charged me $5.50. I ordered a beer which was $4.00 and he charged me $6.00. Every time I complain about price he says the prices were raised and he did not have time to change them. Last time I was there he was yelling at a customer.
This is a joke of the place. A complete embarrassment to the community."}
{"text":"LOVE IT.   Once I discovered it, told ethnic family and went back for breakfast and dinners and brought friends.  I love authentic Croatian-Slovenian food and this is exceptionally authentic.  Either owner Anna or John is always there and they make everything, plus they treat you as if you are family that just came over to visit.   My guests loved the homemade soup, veal and chicken paprikash, and poticia.  Everything is made from scratch, including the pastries and it's wonderful.  Pretty interesting wines too.  Go there if you want authentic home-made and to make a friend with the owners, who sincerely want to get to know how to serve you."}
{"text":"Really good home cooking. If you grew up in a European home, and you miss your moms cooking, look no further. Good coffee as well."}
{"text":"My wife, daughter , and I had dinner there a week ago. The food was good except too much gravy made food soggy. Need to keep the noodles away from gravy. The owner sag with us entire meal. Interesting guy but we did go there to have a family only meal. He should of asked if we were interested in him joining us!! I wonder why when I go by this restaurant I see few people there!"}
{"text":"Food was very good overall, and service was quick, but I got my food to go and the owner was sort of pushy about trying to make me walk out with more than I wanted to order. Some of thsi was just emthusiam about his food, but still it could rub someone the wrong way."}
{"text":"Caf√© Europa is a strange little gem. The owner is so eccentric and a little weird, but man can he cook. And it tastes like the kind of cooking you can only get at ethnic church dinners. The coffee is good. So far I've had the German Breakfast and the cabbage rolls. Both were delicious. Hubby has tried their torte and it was wonderful (I stole a bite!)
I've never seen this place busy, so I wonder how much business he has- but he's always been friendly and the food makes my day."}
{"text":"Great home made food and service is fast and friendly.  The owner/chef is charming and very welcoming.  Great coffee and desserts too."}
{"text":"You win some and you lose some. Tonight I lost. Not a big deal, but the menu says Pepsi products, so I ordered diet. The owner brought me a can of diet coke and poured it before I could say no. I ordered a bowl of wedding soup that came in a bowl that was almost a plate. I finished my less than seasoned soup in about five spoonfuls. My Schnitzle came served on rice with some mixed vegetables that tasted like they were from a can. The potato salad was watery and inedible. Halfway through the fair tasting Schnitzle, I took a bite of the rice and vegetables only to bite down on a small black ROCK!!!! When I brought this to the owner's attention, he threw his Amish produce vendor under the bus!!! No sorry or reduction in bill, or anything. Over all, it was an unimpressive evening."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, where do I begin?  Everything was fine until we ordered.  The chef/owner/waiter was charming, extolling the excellence of the food, pushing the European entrees.  There were 4 of us and two opted for Chicken Paprikas and 2 for sandwiches.  That seemed to set him off.  I ordered the 1/2 pound Grilled Reuben and my other friend ordered a Club Sandwich.  When the food finally came, the Paprikas was an inordinately small portion for $9.75--approximately 1/3 of a chicken breast, 2/3 of a cup of cooked spaetzle and a great deal of gravy, no vegetables were visible.  The sandwiches were a hoot.  My friend's Club Sandwich was 2 pieces of turkey Lunch Meat with lettuce and Italian dressing on 2 pieces of ultra thin dried out rye bread.  My '1/2 pound' Rueben contained at best 1/4 pound of sliced corned beef Lunch Meat--you know, like the kind of Roast Beef they serve at Arby's--processed meat food product!  The bread (the same junk my friend got) was toasted, (not grilled--there was no fat on that bread) on 1 side, the meat was barely warmed, the cheese was not melted--oh, and the sauerkraut was out of the refrigerator cold!  I took 1 bite and pushed it aside.  Oh and the potato chips were stale and largely the 'bottom of the bag' scraps for both of us.  The owner/chef/waiter finally came back in 10 minutes and said what is wrong--I told him the kraut was cold.  He actually hollered at me that you don't cook kraut!  I asked for a box, planning on taking the 'meat' home to put with some other real meat and make a hoagie.  He came back and said, I explain to you--I said I don't want an explanation, I just want a box.  My friends who had the Paprikas mentioned the unpleasant heat in the gravy--likely because instead of sweet paprika he opted for hot Hungarian paprika--probably not the best choice to appeal to global community!  All in all a delightful lunch with friends, but the food was 2 thumbs down by all.  Oh, and I think the ice tea was made from powder.  When I ordered the Reuben I wasn't expecting a Slyman's sandwich.  But I did think it would be better than a sandwich I could have gotten at the Stop n' Go gas station, especially for $9.75."}
{"text":"I call my story the Mocha experience when relating it to friends. My son has a martial arts class in the same shopping center as this place. I went down there one evening deciding I wanted a coffee. I walk in and saw a Europa Mocha on the menu so I said I will have a Mocha to the owner. He said, I know what you want and grabbed a cup put a shot of white chocolate flavoring in it and went in the back to finish making it. He brought it to me and charged me 5.25. I was confused because the only Mocha I saw on the menu was 4.25. I thought maybe the shot was the dollar extra so I payed the cost and walked out. The beverage was delicious cold as it was served to me. The following day I went back seeing as my son had another martial arts class. This is when I noticed that there were two distinct mocha's a white Mocha and a Europa Mocha and they were a dollar difference in price. This time I was clear, I said to the owner I will have a Europa Mocha and he started to make it like the one the day before, I said no please don't put the syrup shot in it and he didn't then he went in the back to finish. He came to the register, handed me my beverage, then charged me 5.25. I said 4.25, I wanted the Europa Mocha and then he blamed the miss communication on not being able to hear me because of the music but did not offer to correct the mistake or charge me less. The mocha without the shot in it was horrible. I came home and the next day sent the owner a harsh message explaining my experience and how upset I was. He responded that evening saying that he was having a bad day and to come in and he will give me five free beverages, that he is a good business owner. I decided to give him another chance. I went down there the following day and he made me a Mocha and I asked for the syrup because I was concerned it would taste horrible without it. I asked him if he had a minute to talk, he said I fix umbrella and kinda started to head outside when I said I will come with you. I also offered to help him if he needed and apologized for the harshness of my message. We went outside and he was busy with the umbrella so I told him I would come back. I had finished my Mocha while watching my son training and decided to get another. I went back and told him I would pay for the next Mocha put the shot in it I won't take advantage of your kindness. He made the drink, took my money and then we began to talk or should I say he talked. He talked for about 15 minutes straight about his business and his food, it was like an infomercial. He asked one question, where do I work. I'm not complaining it just seemed he was more into selling his business to me then actually getting to know me. I'm glad I got the opportunity to know his business a little more but it felt kind of impersonal. After my son's martial arts studio let out I took him down there for some desserts and the owner bragged about them saying they were the best. I had a taste of two of the cakes and one was awful at 4.00 a slice and the other was mediocre at 4.00 a slice. The coffee alone is good though. Three out of the five things I tried were not impressive at all yet he brags about everything as though it is the best! I believe this place could do much better in every area accept the look and cleanliness of it, almost every time I have been there it has seemed empty and its not that big. This is a two star establishment in my book!"}
{"text":"This is a homemade hands on restaurant serving classic comfort food like Wiener schnitzel and cabbage rolls. 

Very affordable ample portions the food is very good and you can order beer or wine but the selection is limited. Homemade desserts coffee espresso and gelato from Italy.  

Breakfast is good too. 

This is a nice little place"}
{"text":"What a great hidden gem.  Talk about authentic!  Friendliest staff ever, great prices, and great food.  Pretty much organic everything and all the food is literally made on site.  I'm currently in town for some work training and am so glad I found this place."}
{"text":"The owner is a very friendly guy who is from Germany. Food was great. I personally  loved the Black Forest cake. Can't wait for him to get his gelato machine."}
{"text":"After reading the first review I don't think we were in the same restaurant.  It is not anything like what Olga says.  It is in a small strip mall and it does serve eastern European food but what I make at home is better.  I ordered cabbage rolls and it was mostly cabbage and very little meat.  The sauce tasted like Campbell's tomato soup.  My husband ordered chicken paprikash and he said what I made was much better and that it wasn't made with sour cream.  The bread was terrible - just white bread toasted.  The salad was ok but what can  you do to a garden salad.  It came with Italian dressing on the side and we weren't asked what kind of dressing we wanted.  No music, only one other table was occupied and they were speaking something other than English and the server spent 90% of his time talking to them and paying little attention to us.  It is cheap - guess  you get what you pay for.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"We just had the best eating out experience at the cute cafe. The owner is an amazing person. He was very understanding with DJ's behaviors while eating. He even gave us some Holy Water he got from the Vatican.  He said a prayer over DJ. He also told us not to worry about what other people think. DJ is our blood, our son, just be grateful for our special family. I was in tears. We will definitely be going back soon. I encourage everyone else too go to."}
{"text":"Best Wiener Schnitzel I ever had in US!  

This place serves like a cafe restaurant that is found in an I untouristed town in Germany.  Food is not fancy, it is like home comfort food. Even deserts are more European than American. I wanted to get one custard pie but I was too full to do so.  The custard looked like custard that you find in Germany, not the conventional supermarket custard. 

Atmosphere inside reminds me the one found in Europe. Deserts show case, drink refrigerator, and the decoration....

Owner gets vegetables from Armish community and they are very fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"I'm a bad employee.  I took today off and went to the north chagrin falls reservation instead  (60 degrees in January?  Who wouldn't?)   I decided to try a place in the area so Cafe Europa it was.  I placed a to-go order and went to pick it up about fifteen minutes later.   The place was completely empty which was a shame because it was absolutely adorable inside.  Kitschy and friendly.  There was homemade baked goods for sale and a little shelf with chocolates and other European desserts.  The prices looked pretty affordable too.  
I ordered the Tuesday special, stuffed cabbage.  For 8 bucks it came with mashed potatoes and bread.  The bread was toasted and buttered and pretty darn good.  The mashed potatoes tasted homemade but nothing really stood out about them.  The stuffed cabbage was a pretty big portion and quite tasty.  However, I thought the sauce (broth?  Don't know what you call it)  was kinda bland.  I had to add hot sauce, salt and pepper.  Overall, a pretty good meal and if I was in the area I would definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"I hate to be a wet noodle for this place because the staff was friendly but that is about it.  I found the place totally empty when I went in 6pm on a Thursday evening.  I ordered Veal goulash & salad. The noodles were watery, the meat was so gross! They didn't take the time to skin the meat...there were pieces of flesh/skin attached to all of the meat...ew! There was a lot of meat but I was so turned off I couldn't eat it. I wondered where the meat came from and was it processed properly.  The sauce was bland on the noodles, I had to add a lot of salt and pepper when I got home.  The home-made bread also lacked any real taste.  I really only wanted 1 piece of dessert but the staff recommended I get two - he wanted me to buy two portions of dinner too, I started to feel bad for them so I ordered two pieces of dessert.  I tossed my bread and goulash in the trash and stashed my dessert in the fridge thinking maybe I could heat it up later and add vanilla ice cream to it.  The salad was ok.  I ended up pouring myself a bowl of corn flakes for dinner. Yuck, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great overall experience!! You walk in and talk to the owner... You can definitely tell how authentic the food is going to taste. Everything is made from scratch, including the pastries!! My family doesn't really like to try different types of foods so it was pretty hard finding something for them to eat. They ended up ordering the chicken marsala with mashed potatoes. It was good. I ordered the chicken prapikash which was outstanding. We also tried about three desserts which were all yummy! 

We will be back. I need to try their coffee :)"}
{"text":"The food was just OK, and that's usually enough to make me try again but i found the owner a bit pushy. He tried to convince us to order beer and/or wine. A little while later he said something like \"You're a big guy, you should get soup, it has a half pound of chicken in it.\" Well I did and no chicken. A few meatballs at best. The soup was good but not seasoned enough. I also ordered veal goulash. It was supposed to come with salad but the salad never came. The goulash was OK at best. The meat had some skin (or tendon or something) on it which was a little gross. The owner was also the waiter and chef. As you can imagine, this can slow things down a bit. The decor is warm and friendly. I wish this would have been a better experience."}
{"text":"Slow but courteous service. Waited a half hr for pancakes and it was mediocre in the taste category. Outside seating available, didn't have a choice to eat outside due to the high temp inside the restaurant. Convenient to all, however."}
{"text":"Ordered vegetarian food owner said he was a vegetarian and they gave me soup that had sausage in it and I found it halfway through the bowl.never eating here again."}
{"text":"The owner is a nut job, yelled at my husband repeatedly( and he wasn't being obnoxious just made the mistake of asking for a piece of bread) the paprikash has no chicken and no flavor. Overall weird bordering on twilight zone experience. Won't go back., pretty apparent why we were the only ones there at dinner time:)"}
{"text":"Cafe Europa and Bistro was wonderful. First of all the owner was one of the nicest people we've ever met. So kind and welcoming. I had the chicken paprikash which was delicious. We also sampled three desserts which were equally as good. They make wonderful espresso and coffee drinks. We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We came in from Texas and this place was absolutely delicious. Everything is homemade, authentic and organic. Staff is very inviting and friendly 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Wonderful baked walleye (not overcooked!) served over a rice pilaf, fresh veggie blend of summer squash, broccoli, red peppers and side of homemade redskin potato salad.  Menu features lots of European specialties (paprikas, goulash, homemade soup) and there's a very tempting display case full of desserts!"}
{"text":"This review is for anyone who find themselves within a two mile radius of this place, living or driving by. 

This review is just and only about the noteworthy bread they served me with breakfast. Warm and capital B- Buttered. 

Now, breakfast is breakfast, and their service has consistently been friendly, but I have to give this place a boast for their bread. Now you KNOW. They have the heartiest loaf of yum bread around and I do declare you've missed the mark if you come near this place and have driven by without snagging a loaf for yourself. Love your kids. Love your friends. Buy a loaf. Buy me a loaf. It's such a nice \"just because\" I'm coming over gift. It's a great buy for when you have a warm gathering I guarantee you will be asked about it. Slice it with the generosity of a loving mother to her favorite child. Elevate it with good butter or your own famous spread. Or serve it plain with a variety of jams for everyone to choose from. Tell me about it.

(Now, they don't really REALLY sell this bread by the loaf, but they are *willing* to... and you would be in luck if they had any available after I let this Insiders tip out of the bag. Maybe call first. Maybe make sure that i didn't get the last loaf before you walked in. See you in Willoughby, here's winking at you, kid.)"}
{"text":"Small intimate place with only home cooked dishes, paprikash to die for, incredible desserts, great coffees.... Strudel or dobosh torte and coffee with friends, or meals from breakfast to dinner. I can't think of a a criticism. Every thing is good and the prices are reasonable. Authentic European dishes. (Call ahead with a large party, tho). The owner is a doll, will make you feel like he's welcomed to his home, sharing thoughts on making strudel or the mostly local ingredients at dinner. His wife takes care of breakfast."}
{"text":"This is the most authentic and fresh European food I've tasted around here. do yourself a favor and try it!"}
{"text":"we are headed to a family Octoberfest where we bring something authentic and German beer or wine. we just got back from honeymoon and setting back to work so hubby found this authentic European bistro.  Walk in and greeted by owner who clearly is passionate about his  business/craft. so friendly we told him what looking for and so many choices for bakery and he explained ea piece. Johan gave us tour of kitchen and explained how fresh and homemade everything is. they offer breakfast beginning monday-friday 6a.  sat 7am and sunday 10am.  did anyone say Crepes?   everyone loved the pastries and we look forward to checking out dinner .  love local."}
{"text":"Friendly, extremely clean, good value, attentive, local owners (chef & waiter) and slow food: all made on site. 

What's not to like with a hard working couple who really, really cares about the customers & the food?

We'll be back again. Thank you for the delightful lunch on such a cold & miserable snowy day."}
