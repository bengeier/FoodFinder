{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but the fact that we waited an hour and a half for delivery that never arrived because they gave our order to someone else....not only did u screw us over but the uber driver as well.   So for service you get. 0"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today. I'm a fan. The staff was really nice. The prices are great, especially if you choose one of the daily specials (6$). They have Japanese food but also Korean items on the menu.

I had beef teriyaki (6$ daily special), with rice and veggies. Wakame salad (3.5$) which was really good, I love the dressing. And I asked the chef to make me a sushi roll with his favorite stuff. The roll was great! I ended up paying 20$ for the beef, the roll, salad, 2 soups, and juice - which is really reasonable."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is so delicious and very fresh.

I'm always on the search for good healthy, reasonably priced options and this place hits all those notes. 7.99$ for a bibap and noodle soup is extremely reasonable for fresh veggie dishes on King St. (seriously, it's a good 4$ more for a salad that size from just down the street at brioche) which makes it a perfect lunch spot. I treat myself to it whenever I feel like a salad from the area --side note, I just ask for less rice to make it a salad (nice to be able to control how hearty you want it). And I love that you can see all the fresh toppings going into your food. As for the portion sizes, I had the take out bowl and when I put it on a plate, it was a mound. 

Overall, I'm always satisfied and I didn't blow my budget or calorie budget for the day. I'm a big fan. I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I stopped by to grab lunch while waiting for a prescription at Shoppers today and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and service here -- especially given how cheap my food was! Great sushi (with black rice, which is super healthy) and very friendly, competent staff. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I use to always go here for lunch - religiously. They were one of the, if not only decent sushi place along the path that was also decently priced.

Recently however, I noticed that the portions and the quality of their items have gone downhill. It's such a shame that this had to happen because everything was pretty good before this sudden shift.

The only redeeming quality they have now is that they have 30% sushi after 2 or 3pm."}
{"text":"Delicious (soup is my fave) and the man is so friendly. Did feel he was pretty rude the girl working so is probably a slavedriver."}
{"text":"Good place for lunch. The food is fresh and healthy. The people who work there are always very polite and welcoming. I'm a big fan of the beef bibimbap and the chicken cutlet."}
{"text":"I only ever get the bibimbap, it's healthy, tasty, well-portioned and the joint gets full stars for the service."}
{"text":"Got the beef bibimbap in June (shortly after they opened). Tasted great, and their eggs are shaped like flowers.

Unfortunately, the serving sizes were way too small for a ~$10 lunch. They only filled the take out bowl halfway."}
{"text":"I always sorta scoffed when I saw this chain downtown Toronto, I kinda wrote it off as crummy Korean fast food and I never gave it a chance. Recently, they opened a brand new location in the Sussex centre near Burnhamthorpe and Hurontario in Mississauga near where I have my office and I had the opportunity (more like had limited options otherwise) to try them out.

Wow. It's actually a legit meal. It's healthy, it's fresh, they provide MASSIVE portions and it was such a great value. 

You can have fresh sushi which is pre-prepared but always fresh daily, or an assortment of Korean-infused mains, Without question, the go-to option @ Bibab Express is their Bibimbap bowls (boxes). It's set up in the same style as a Subway or Chipotle where you build your meal with the ingredients you want from meat to veggies to rice (white, brown or purple) and top it with the sauces of your choice.

I went with a purple rice, bulgogi beef bibimbap topped with everything including a fresh egg. It was super heavy in my hands but light on the stomach in the end (as well as the wallet - $8.50+tax). 

Best of all when you purchase 9 bibimbap's you get your 10th free! Really enjoyed this and it's definitely a great fresh healthy alternative to nearby food courts at SquareOne Mall.

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"The bibimbap is okay, but I found the flavours boring and out of harmony with one another. Also, the eggs are not freshly fried. I understand why they do this, but the pre-fried egg was rubbery and lukewarm. 

The sushi was also okay. I purchased a tray of salmon sashimi and california rolls. The sashimi was acceptable, but not the best grab-and-go I've had. The california rolls were atrocious. The avocado was rock hard and stringy with brown spots. Completely inedible."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place in the Richmond-Adelaide Centre foodcourt and the line was quite long so I decided to give it a try.

This place allows you to create your own bibimbap. 
Step 1) pick a rice (white, brown, black)
Step 2) meat choice (chicken, beef, tofu, salmon)
Step 3) Veggies 
Step 4) Sauce (different spice levels).

The one I got was quite spicy which drowned out the rest of the taste of the meat and veggies, otherwise it was quite enjoyable for a food court korean place. With that being said, it is a pretty unique choice from all the other chains in the downtown core."}
{"text":"Had marked this fast food joint a long time ago and hadn't had a chance to try it. Finally made it for lunch. 

Ordered a Tofu Bibimbap that comes with a tiny Miso Soup. 
You get a choice of white or brown rice and a choice of veggies that you want. If you say everything a bowl from literally nowhere comes and all the veggies go into your box. You still get asked if you want onions and a mixture of green/red peppers. A sauce gets added and a red pepper hot sauce is added as per your preference. Go ahead and be bold as the sauce is not as spicy I ordered a hot option and it was medium level for me. 

There is hardly any Tofu that you can taste. The quantity was disappointing and so was the cut of Tofu. The Tofu were cut in thin strips. 

The overall quantity of the Soup and the meal is disappointing as well as it ends up as a light meal for me. So if you are hungry try something else or alternatively if you want something light, it's good. Mind you in a couple of hours you will need a snack to tide you over."}
{"text":"Tired of Freshii? Want some real meat with your salad? Do you want it Korean style?  If you said yes to all of this, then this is the place to go.  It's like an Asian Freshii but cheaper and better than Freshii.  They seem to have different daily specials too.  I came for lunch on a Wednesday and had the beef bimibab  special for $6.95.  It came with a small bowl of miso soup too. 

Ambiance: 3/5 - mostly takeout with 3-4  tables and about 10-15 seats, but very clean.

Service: 4/5 - yes, it's mostly takeout and usually when you do takeout (even if you eat in), you pay ahead of time.  The nice owners here were like \"sit down, you can pay later\".  So friendly and accommodating.  Love it.  

Food: 3.5/5 - don't expect piping hot stone pot bimibap here, but what you can expect is really fresh ingredients (which doesn't always hold true for this dish at other places) that is tasty and a reasonable portion for a very reasonable price.  I also noticed they had some nice looking sushi.  

Overall, I'd give this place a 3.5/5 but will round up to 4 since the owners were so friendly."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim yesterday as I was working from home and too lazy to make my food. First off, this is fast food and located within the Sussex Centre across from the Novotel Hotel in Mississauga.  

Most of the people buying work in the building so there are only two small tables.  I don't, but I was curious to see what was in there and saw a Korean fast food place which intrigued me.  They had bimibap, bento boxes, noodle bowls and sushi.  The sushi looked expensive (about $10 per roll), but everything else seemed reasonably priced.  I had a bento box, where you can get to choose your protein, get a side of rice and veggies and then get to choose two sides (sweet potato noodles, fruits, rolls, etc) and it was $10 before tax.  I think everything else was close to that as well. 

As for the quality of food, well the ingredients were definitely fresh and very well laid out.  The service was very friendly too.  However, overall taste was average, but if I worked in the building, I would go again. Actually, since I only live a 2 minute walk away and I'm feeling too lazy to cook and I'm working from home, I'd go.  

Verdict: Good healthy fast food place if you're in the area, but I'd assume they only be open Monday to Friday during the lunch hours since it's an office building."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to see this little gem in downtown!? I was looking for something small to eat before the work and the Bibab caught my eyes. Wasn't hungry enough to go for the full portion so tried their roll. Nicely wrapped and most importantly, I could still sense crunch shrimp underneath the thin layer of firm rice. Very pleasant experience!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite place for lunch because the food they serve is truly the balance of eating healthy but not overly healthy like pure salad (greens) only.  My personal go to food here is their Noodle Bimbap.  It's very similar to the regular rice bibimbap, but instead of mixing the vegetables and the choice of your meat (Chicken or Beef) or Tofu into your rice, the mix it into a udon and it becomes what I call a Udon Salad!

The Udon Salad portion is huge, I consider myself as a big guy and it can fill me up fine for lunch.  For just 9$ for a Udon Salad, it is one of the better if not the best semi-healthy meal in downtown standards.  The Udon Salad (Bibap) comes with an egg and you can pretty much choose whatever vegetables you want.  Top if off with either a spicy or soy sauce and a complementary Miso Soup, you have yourself a great meal!

If you work in the financial distract and is good navigating the path, I recommend checking out this place!"}
{"text":"Bibab Express is conveniently located at the food court near my office so I go there religiously for lunch!

I usually get the beef bibimbap with purple rice ($10) and choose from their assorted sides such as shiitaki, spinach, carrots, cucumbers etc. - you can choose as many sides as you want). You also have the option of getting a flower-shaped sunny side up egg which I find very cute! Miso soup comes with the meal as well. I always overestimate my tolerance for hot sauce so it's nice that they have a water machine nearby so I can put out the spiciness in my mouth! 

The quality of the beef is a bit inconsistent. Sometimes they are cooked too well and they end up being very dry. Overall, I think the price is reasonable for the quality Bibab Express has to offer."}
{"text":"Ordered sashimi n the guy was lazy n turned me away. Dont bs saying u got nomore sashimi. Bad service"}
{"text":"I like the concept of this healthy Korean / Japanese food. 
I can have choose of rice, veggies, meat and mix with the sauce that I choose as well.
Welcoming couple owner's always friendly to me.
It's such an enjoyable lunch time for me."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch with a coworker. I ordered the Bulgogi on rice ($8.45). 

To my surprise you can choose either white, brown, or black rice at no extra charge for the latter two. This is good because I would definitely prefer the latter two and other restaurants would charge like a dollar extra. The food comes with a bowl complimentary miso soup and you can get lemon water and tiny cups of ginger as well. For about 10 bucks after tax it's a pretty good deal. 

When I started trying the food I found the brown rice to be a bit too hard, like they haven't cook it thoroughly enough. There were a lot of rice, I had some leftover. The beef was pretty good and they give you a decent amount of it. Vegetables are disappointing because you can tell it's been frozen. The broccoli was dry and the taste was bad. The other vegetables were ok though. They give you a little bit of everything.

I would come back to this place again, maybe try out their build your own bibimbap next time."}
{"text":"Efficient, efficient, efficient. In the food court, this place consistently has the longest line (maybe competing with the nearby Soup Nutsy). They still get everyone through the line really quickly.

Pick your bibimbap (soup? rice? meat?), pick the veggies to go in (Subway-style), and watch as they mix it up with sauce, drop a fried egg on top, and sprinkle away with sesame seeds. Good to go. Cashes in at a little under $9.

If you're looking for good bibimbap, you're in the wrong place. But I am assuming you are trying to get lunch during your one-hour lunch break; in that case, this place isn't bad. It's filling, not overly unhealthy, and tasty enough. A little too cold to be real bibimbap though.

They also have bento box and sushi options, if bibimbap doesn't tickle your fancy. (And if you are REALLY particular, you can ask them to make specific sushi rolls for you on the spot.)

I AM a fan of the awesome korean ladies who work here though-- even given my one-minute progress through line, she made conversation with me and smiled a lot. Definitely brightens up your workday!"}
{"text":"Really dont like giving negative reviews, but... food was cold, and veggies were all stems (not sure if fresh or from frozen). Bento box special spring roll had literally one carrot inside. Dont think anything was made from scratch onsite except for the sushi. Left full, but mainly on rice and miso soup. Other reviewers suggest friendly service, but I went in with a smile hoping the place would be good, was only person in restaurant and peoole did not seem happy. Wouldnt go back. Way better korean spots out there with made fresh food, more flavor, and better value. Disappointed :("}
{"text":"Passable Maki, edible sushi, horrid Bimbim bop... beef tasted like like overdone taco bell meat.   For the prepackaged maki/sushi or Bento, as mentioned, sushi/maki is passable.  Bento falls into the Bimbim bop catagory.  Over done meat, rice is not that great, overly sauced.."}
{"text":"Excellent option in the area for a fresh 'clean' lunch. I ordered the bibimbap bowl with brown rice, chicken and all the vegetables - at least 10 different kinds! The sauce is amazing, but I forego it to avoid the sugar. For under $10 you could easily split it into two lunches."}
{"text":"I love this place in the PATH at Richmond Adelaide Centre! The employees are all so cute and super nice :) I usually get the bibimbap, and I like that you have the option of getting it with white, brown or black rice. You can also customize the vegetables you want in it, but I just usually get everything. They have a very wide variety, which includes peppers, mushrooms, onions, spinach, and even alfalfa sprouts. You then also get to customize your sauce to the level of spiciness that you want. The best part is the egg they put in, which is sooo cute and flower shaped! It is $7.95 + tax if you get the bibimbap with meat, and also comes with a free miso soup :) Overall the quality of the food is good, although not as good as the bibimbap in a restaurant because it is not in the hot stone bowl. Sometimes I do find it to be a little bland. However, I would still consider this to be good for food court food."}
{"text":"Good, but could use either more doenjang or doenjang with more flavor.  Very clean and very efficient.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I just happened to be walking home looking for take out and came across this place in my neighbourhood which I was meaning to try.
They have a nice selection of Korean dishes and prepared sushi plates. I was there towards the end of the day which just so happens they mark down their sushi by 30% on their already reasonable prices. It's definitely better than any supermarket or AYCE sushi, and the fish was fresh and the flavour was there.
The manager was really nice and guided me through their dishes and selection of sushi. The place was clean and modern and service was really good. It another fast casual restaurant for a quick bite or take out, nothing special but everything was good and well priced. Prompt and very friendly service was a plus."}
