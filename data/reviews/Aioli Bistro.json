{"text":"recently dinned here for the first time earlier this month and enjoyed everything from the delicious vegetarian pasta the chef created, to the cozy, romantic candlelit ambiance. Aioli is a little hidden treasure in the east end, I cannot wait to return. I especially loved the fresh, warm bread with the olive? dip.  I don't even like olives but I really loved that dip! the staff, including the chef, are very friendly and courteous.  The restaurant is clean and quaint. you would never guess such a lovely place existed on the Kingston strip."}
{"text":"Henri is a fantastic host and the food is outstanding! Very authentic and wonderfully intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Great French food. Big portions. The chef knows what he's doing here.   I got the Chevre en Croute, to start and Cassoulet de Toulouse for my main. It was absolutely scrumptious. If you live in Scarborough and appreciate good food you have to go here.  I can echo the positive customer service I read in the other review. Really attentive service and the chef answered all my questions about the dishes."}
{"text":"Terrific! Food is delicious and wine is fantastic. Chef Henry makes the experience. The place won't disappoint. The food and music evenings are wonderful for any music or food enthusiast."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious. Love the ambience and customer service. Food was a little over seasoned and salty. The lavender and honey Creme brûlée was a little different from what I expected. The bread was good. Overall experience was ok."}
{"text":"I'm almost afraid to write this review else too many discover this gem in a not so great location in Scarborough. Although originally from the East Coast I don't normally eat fish. My dining companion said \"you always have chicken- be more adventurous\" so I had the Atlantic salmon and it was to die for - most delicious salmon I've had in about 30 years & the price was phenomenal as well.  The only negative is that you can OD on the freshly baked baquettes with the most delicious garlic butter spread which is included with your meal.  Thank You, Henri - I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious and was truly impressed with the quality and overall experience! Each meal comes with a fresh baguette accompanied with a housemade aioli was that smooth, creamy, slightly garlicky, but overall, delicious as a starter. The muscles (as a starter) were immersed in a creamy, broth-like white wine sauce that was also garlicky but featured amazing flavor that complimented the muscles well; the sauce in itself is good on its own as well. As for the entrée, the lamb was cooked to the point that the meat was falling off the bone, yet it was not overly done to the point of being dry, but rather remained moist and flavourful. The lamb sat on roasted sweet potatoes and mash potato, all in a wonderful sauce that pulled the entire dish together. Desserts were alright, in comparison the rest of the meal. The creme brûlee didn't have a creamy texture, and unfortunately, the sugar on top was burnt, leaving a slightly bitter taste. The crepe was interesting, as it was served cold, with an odd, slightly sweet liquid all on top. Overall, the bistro has a nice ambiance, while serving amazing, flavourful food. Chef Henry made an effort to speak to our table, to ensure the meal was going well! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Terrific little French bistro here in Scarborough! I had driven past it so many times, I finally decided to try it out - best decision of the weekend! The ambience really tries to re-create the true French Bistro feel, and the friendly owner certainly helps that out. The décor is comfortable, and the place is small, so reservations are a good idea on the weekend. The wine list is small but very well set out for you to enjoy without draining your wallet. The chef brought us amuse-bouche to introduce us to the experience - delicious little broiled cherry tomato tarts. We started with the Caesar salad - very nice, with good quantities of real bacon and homemade croutons - and the mussels marinieres - excellent, large, plump mussels that were not overcooked. First of the mains was the cassoulet - delicious, marvelous rich flavor, although I personally thought that the ratio of meat to beans was actually too high. Don't kill me, I actually like beans, and cassoulet should be beans flavoured with meat, not meat flavoured with beans. Either way, it was still excellent! Next was the daube d'agneau - a Mediterranean inspired lamb stew that was probably the highlight of the night. Rich, tender chunks of lamb in a delicious sauce - I ate until I hurt! Finally, I should talk about the terrific salmon - perfectly cooked, lightly flavoured to accent the fish not hide it, this was excellent. It was all washed down with a wonderfully affordable wine. Unfortunately, the mains were so good and so filling, none of us had room for dessert, which is a shame because they looked spectacular! You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"(1st visit) A warm and welcoming little bistro in this unassuming Cliffside village strip.  A pleasing sort of split level dining area adorned with art and curiosities that ( I assume always) starts you off with fresh baguette & that wonderful aioli spread. Apps were impressive, loved the smoked duck.  Salad was fresh with a nice vinaigrette, not to be sent back.   The Muscovy duck was so memorable - a tender savoury-sweet sumptuousness that we both can't wait to return for.  My date shared her braised beef and it was melt-in-your mouth, nicely seasoned, not overcooked.  Great wine list. Not a dessert guy but imho they were good ( a cheesecake, creme brûlée which she said wasn't the best ever but decent) Henri  is a very friendly attentive host and even let us sample a bit. 1st dinner but I suspect they shine most brightly on their meat entrees (hope to try the lamb shank next time). I'm not a foodie fine dining snob - I like value4$ and In this middlish neighbourhood this little spot has to be one of the best. Very rarely give 5/5, was tempted here."}
{"text":"This place is a gem, and they serve fresh hot baguette! Our baguette came with an aioli made with garlic, capers, and olives which was surprisingly good as I'm not a fan of olives. We ordered the grilled calamari az an app to share, then go the main salmon, spicy sausage pasta, smoked duck pasta, duck confit, and scallop risotto. All were delicious except the calamari and duck confit, hence the 4 stars. The grilled calamari was so over cooked, and the salad it came with was over dressed. The duck was just too salty. Other then that, everything was great and the staff there were so pleasant. Would definitely go back, just not for the grilled calamari."}
{"text":"Fantastic! We've have been meaning to try this place for a few weeks now. We showed up yesterday around 5'clock,without a reservation and the Chef squeezed us in prior to a party of 6 people booked for 6. We promised to be quick and he was more than willing to accommodate us. Over all fantastic .A must visit."}
{"text":"We came to this beautiful little restaurant at July 25 which is my birthday. What I really like about this place is those 80's decorations.   The food is absolute delicious. I really like how they make their garlic butter go with bread. Besides you won't worry about walking out from this restaurant with three course food but still feel hungry. They have very large portion for their main course.   In the end thanks the chief for the free Dessert and salad. That was the nicest birthday gift from a stranger."}
{"text":"Overall solid 4 stars  First off, Kudo to Aioli for doing Winterlicious right: the entrees offered were from the regular menu.  Customers got a taste of what dining regularly could be like and, I assure you, would want more.   I had the duck leg and my boyfriend had salmon fish fillet as entrees.  Both dishes were well portioned.  The duck leg tasted bold.  The meat fell off the bone.  It was slightly over cooked.  I was okay to overlook the minor imperfection as the business volume of Winterlicious often forced kitchens to cook in big batches.  The sides were earthy; they balanced the boldness of the duck well.  The plating was beautiful.  So much attention to details.  The salmon was delicately flavoured.  The chef let the ingredients shine.   The appetizers (soup and mussels) and desserts (creme brulee and crepe) were good.  The housemade baguette and aioli spread were outstanding.  I am so glad that Winterlicious introduces this hidden gem to me.  The restaurant is quaint.  The services is welcoming.  The regular menu features more duck entrees.  I am tempted to return soon.   Last but not least, the pricing of the regular menu is affordable for French food.  All entrees are priced mid-$20.  Desserts are around $7.  Prices of appetizers vary."}
{"text":"I can only assume the reviews have been written by their friends.   No 'foodie' would give this place a good review.  The place itself has changed names more times than I can remember and it's still the same owners.  If you like stewed type food then maybe you will enjoy but otherwise the menu is very outdated.  French cuisine? circa 1950 maybe. If you really like good food, well prepared ViPei is 100% better than this place.  I wouldn't recommend  this place to anyone.  Cheap yes good no !"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Feels like you are in a Paris bistro."}
{"text":"Love love this new find of a restaurant! Recently bought a place and moved into the Birchcliff neighborhood and was looking for a nice neighborhood restaurant to pass sometime. Given that Suburban living is quiet an adjustment after living downtown for years. So I went yelping for some cool restaurants and found Aioli on Yelp. I went to check it out with my mom and the food was great! Doesn't hurt that the place is so cute, cosy and intimate. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"A little getaway on Kingston road.  The chef was a lovely attentive man.  The place is tiny and cozy so make a reservation.  The appetizers and the crepes were my favorite.  The dinners we had were really good portions and very subtle in favour.  We loved the décor and the atmosphere.  Looking forward to another visit to try some more of his dishes!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous quaint little restaurant, located in an unassuming neighborhood. A real gem!  The service was impeccable, with our server remembering our 7 year old daughter's name throughout the dinner and engaging her in conversation, unlike most servers who ignore children almost completely (other than shoving some crayons at them).  The food was fantastic. Warm bread with delicious aioli, mussels, lamb shanks, salmon, pasta.... all delicious and extremely generous portions. Two thumbs up from my 17 years old and 7 year old, and each of us took home a second meal!  A special treat were some dessert samplers, on the house for my birthday celebration. They were FANTASTIC, as was my glass of Bordeaux.   The prices were quite reasonable, with mains around $20. The wine was a little pricey, but totally worth it.  We will be returning soon, thank you Henry."}
