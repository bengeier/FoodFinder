{"text":"Love this spot, great food especially the hot dogs. Some people complain about the wait however I think they are worth the wait since the food is made to order not just sitting there and taste delicious when it's freshly made. It's my go to spot since it's convenient due to their hours, open late for them late night munchies."}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs!!!!! Must have if you're on the west side of town! You won't regret it and they offer more on their menu not just hot dogs. If only I could eat here every night without the calories... Haha"}
{"text":"So I've been going to this place for a while and they always take a good while to make the food. During the week is not so bad, but on the weekends it does take a little bit longer, because it's so busy. I asked as to why and I was told it's because they make the food as you order it. So, no wonder it takes them some time, but also no wonder it's so delicious! It's definitely worth the wait. What I do now, I order 30 minutes before I go pick up my food, it's always ready to go around that time frame."}
{"text":"This place has awful customer service. Took them more than 30 minutes to make 3 hot dogs when there was only 6 people at the food truck. We finally gave up on waiting so we just got a refund and left."}
{"text":"This is probably the last place you would want to get a torta. There tortas are too skinny.  The customer service is terrible. Waited for 10 minutes and no one came and took our order until finally we said something. When I asked for the check, the girl had to add it all up and was still taking her time chatting with another customer instead of focusing on us. I'm sure the hotdog was okay but I would rather go to La Pasadita Hot Dogs instead."}
{"text":"The food quality has definitely gone down. And when I say food quality, I mean specifically the elotes. I used to go and get an elote in a cup and they used to be DELICIOUS but now they put a lot of butter and not enough mayo and never enough lime. Meh!"}
