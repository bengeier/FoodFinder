{"text":"Great place, we went there for the first time and sat at the bar.  We were bar hopping and decided to have their house wine and calamari.
The calamari presentation was beautiful, it was cooked perfectly and it was delicious.
Good service, good wine, friendly and relaxed atmosphere.
Will go again and try the wings, i was reading other reviews and apparently they are awesome (i'm crazy for wings and the Black Cat's dry spice wings are the best so far, at least for me)"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review for my girlfriend who said to me: \"Something needs to be said for our awful food/service!\"

And just to say, we only came here because it was 3pm and The Local was not open until 5pm.

From the moment we stepped in I could tell the waitress was unhappy with her miserable life, or something. She kept texting on her phone and not paying attention to us even being there... (It was not busy, maybe our table and 3 others) When she FINALLY got up off her butt to come serve us, her arms were crossed in a very closed off and unfriendly manner, as she asked what she could get us. My friend asked for a drink menu in which case the waitress said \"we don't have one\" and looked away from her.. Not even mentioning what she had on tap, what she could get us instead... she just closed off the conversation completely. When we finally ordered, (it was like pulling teeth to get her to tell us what was on tap...) I had the burger which wasn't so terrible. But my friend had a cajun wrap which was absolutely disgusting. There was too much seasoning. It was like biting into a giant grain of salt. By this point I noticed my friend wasn't eating. I tried to get the waitress' attention but she was in her own little world.  She had only come back once to refill my friends boyfriends drink and left mine and my friends drinks empty for an hour, without the mention of a refill... and without her coming over to take my friends complaint to fix her food. She was too busy texting.

Needless to say after an hour of waiting... We put our plates and my friends unfinished plate of food on the bar for her to take away (When she was ready of course) And went to grab beers somewhere else.

Needless to say we did NOT tip and we will NOT be back.

Do not go here."}
{"text":"This place has amazing wings. The lemon pepper and blackened dry rubs are particularly awesome. They have really nice flavour. They charge $18 for 1.5 lbs of wings, however it was worth it (they did half wings one flavour and half the other). They were so great we came back again. The only disappointing part was the second time we came back, they charged a $1 fee to have two flavours. Not too happy that they don't apply this consistently (and that they charge this in the first place). Also, the food is a little pricey --- $7 for fries. I'd come back again for the wings though."}
{"text":"We visited this pub  today after a walk in the area. The place was clean and lively with all the soccer games playing on the many tvs.  The service was friendly  attentive and efficient.  There was a nice beer selection and after describing what we wanted, we enjoyed recommended selection by our waitress.

We had three freshly prepared dishes as we were  sitting by the kitchen and were able to see the prepareation 1. a side cesare salad  2. crab cakes with a baby green salad 3. voodoo shrimps with cornbread.   

All food items we had were very fresh and tasty.  The dressing on the crunchy romaine lettuce cesare salad was full of balanced rich flavour topped off with real bacon and a lemon wedge for added zest.  The crab cakes were dense crispy and moist with fish and not filler.  They sat on a lovely  chutney and were served with a baby green salad topped with a delicate cilantro, tomato chive dressing.  The voodoo shrimp were spicy and flavourful served with toasted cornbread.  Again well balanced flavour an textures. 

We will go back again for more food and beer and feel the prices are fair for hand made, quality pub food."}
{"text":"Nice little Sports Bistro on Roncesvalles and definately great to watch sports at. Lots of TVs conveniently located and a nice up front patio to watch the Roncesvalles walking traffic. Good selection of beers including my fav cobblestone stout. Food is tasty. I had the Blue Jay sandwich and fries. Tasty but definately priced at upper scale pub prices ($14). my plate was 3/4 fries and 1/4 sandwich. The service was good and attentive.

Definately a good choice for sports and beer on Roncesvalles."}
{"text":"I recently ate here with a group of friends and we found the food to be overpriced and mediocre, and the service to be poor.

Our waitress (dressed in a ratty tank top with stains on it - uniforms or proper clothing, anyone?) couldn't be bothered to return to our table to ask if we wanted another drink or if the meal was OK - it wasn't busy, so there is no excuse.

And then she made a fuss when we asked her to split up the bill. She seemed miserable. Listen, if you don't enjoy your job, find a different bar or find a different industry altogether.

They have a good selection of local beers on tap, but don't be fooled ... gastro sports pub = typical sports pub.

I will not eat here again. There are better options in the area."}
{"text":"Went to The Dizzy for the second time last night and it was a great experience. The service was great, Kaisa always made sure that we were doing well and had everything we needed. My friend got the chicken poboy and loved it and I had the J.R burger and it was delicious! Great restaurant and I will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for a drink with two of my friends. The service was fantastic; our waitress (she had almost white blonde hair) was more than ok that we wanted to only order drinks. Very sweet and friendly. No complaints about service.

The decor is nothing to be enthralled at. A bunch of license plates and sports logo memorabilia on the walls. Kind of gaudy...stuck in the 1990's.

The customers are... hmm, how do I say this? They stared at us. We are 'different people', but I don't know if that was the reason. No awkward comments thrown around like the last reviewer experienced. Still, I didn't feel comfortable. I get the feeling that it's a bar that is a hangout for a group of friends that grew up together and have been going there for 20 years - not open to new regulars. Just my perception, though."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this with some friends Thursday night. This place is home to some wicked and not-so-wicked food. So fair warning, be careful when you order. Must haves: the Mexican flavoured wings, Jalapeno burger, or Austin City Melt (for those of you who are vegetarian). Do not order: Jamaican jerk wings, or the chicken tequila pasta. Both were tasteless and major regrets of the night."}
{"text":"Sunday around 4:30pm ...Atmosphere was good, pretty good crowd, menu SOUNDED great. Got three quarters of a way through our drinks when a HUGE ROACH started to crawl towards us on our bench (was the bench closest to the kitchen in the very back) My friend went and told the waiter we would not be eating there and we would settle our bill for the drinks- the waitress didn't bat an eye when she said \"Dont worry about the drinks, have a good night\" 
She also did not make any moves to go and kill the huge SUCKER before it crawled onto anyone elses table BLECH**"}
{"text":"This place is great!!  Their food sets them apart from other 'pubs' big time, I had the Steak special which was super good and really affordable as well.
Beer selection was great, plenty of craft and standard brews to pick from.

All in all, it's your typical Roncy spot where the people are friendly, the food is great and the beer and wine flows freely!!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've only been to The Dizzy a couple times. I'm sure I'll be back again in the coming months to try more of their menu and drinks. 
There are so many great spots along Roncy, how can I choose? Well, this particular day i was searching for some good nachos. Not all pub/bar places serve nachos (gasp!) but they really are a must for me when i need something crunchy and cheesy (which is often). 
Friends I've gone with have had the wings and the ribs, which they both enjoyed. But I can really only speak for myself and my nachos. They were good! Lots of toppings, good distribution, plenty of cheese. Very enjoyable. 
They staff was super nice and fun. Chatty but not overly so. 
The atmosphere is cozy, the big booths are coveted. I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a neighbourhood watering hole, you can't do better than the Dizzy. Places like this are sadly in decline with the prevalence of chain pubs and sports bars where the service is impersonal and robotic. We popped in here after a delicious Polish Dinner down the street and were greeted my Michelle, who was rocking the whole place. This girl is a total professional and has a great rapport with her guests. She took care of us like we were regulars and I really appreciate when service staff are human and enjoy what they do. I would come back to this bar in a heartbeat because of that level of service and care. The Dizzy is a neighbourhood gem. Thanks, Michelle!"}
{"text":"It was ambiguous and, sadly, not embiggening.

Gastropub is a tough term to clearly define as it is, but The Dizzy takes things to a new level categorizing itself as a gastro sports pub. Yup, it's right there on the sign and the menu.

The menu certainly didn't look as swanky as other gastropubs I've visited thought the beer selection was really solid with quite a few irregular beers.

There were a lot of TVs and each one of them had a sporting event on display, so that fit with the name.

And there were nice booths and a really friendly server. That's pubby, yes?

I'm so confused and I think The Dizzy is too.

It's definitely worth a stop for a few pints and a look around just to figure it out for yourself."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots on Roncy.The Chicken po boy is fantastic and their burger is one of my favourites. Great selection of beer and the steak night special is sooo good and cheap!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for wing night and was not disappointed!

The atmosphere is friendly, the service was fantastic and the wings were good. They also had some good beers available (Beau's is one of my new favourites). I asked for the spiciest wings, of course, and they were pretty spicy, but nothing crazy. They also had dry wings, which I was kind of regretful for not getting. 

The fries are great! They're sort of bistro style with the skin on. 

One of my dining companions is allergic to dairy, wheat and eggs and was super happy to be able to find a wing place that does them without breading.

Monday is wing night, where wings are 50% off. They have food specials every night of the week.

They also have a bunch of screens for you to watch sports if that's your thing, and also a few banquets so it's easy to talk to your friends, if that's your thing. I'd be back again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Great spot! 
Came by on a week day after-work for a drink and light dinner. The patio was full, but there was plenty of space inside. 

Got a pint of Wellington I think - I really don't remember. But it was cold and refreshing - just what we needed.

They had fish tacos on special, so grabbed a couple of those as well. I wasn't expecting much, but really good tacos! I'd definitely order again."}
{"text":"I like the food here!  I know some say it's over priced for pub-type food, but I've not found it to be THAT expensive.

Last time we were there, my bf ordered the chicken po-boy on ciabatta and I had wings and nachos with the salsa/guac/s.cream martini thingy.  The nachos/salsa thingy was over-priced at $8 ($8?? I mean c'mon, really?) but the rest was reasonable.

The chicken po-boy was AH-MAZING. So good and fresh and crispy and juicy and.. ohhh.. uh hem. I'm drooling. Sorry about that. They make it fresh to order and when it's gone, it's gone. 

Anyway, the food is good. The service is okay.. nothing to brag about. I like the atmosphere, there's lots of TV's and it's a cozy little place to duck into on a chilly day and grab a bite and a beer after walking around on Roncey. I love the curved booths.. nice and relaxing to chill in."}
{"text":"Good place to watch the game or have a casual dinner. Had the wings and they were grilled rather than fried which was nice. Very tasty.
Lots of good local craft beers on tap which I like. Friendly service and lots of TV's to watch the hockey game if that's why you're going. Haven't tried any other food there but from what I saw it looked good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I just got home from having one of the most delicious meals I can remember...  

I've always enjoyed the Dizzy, although they've gone through periods where they are better or worse, but if today's special was anything to judge by they are definitively on an upswing.  

I have a feeling that it's going to become part of the regular menu, but just in case it isn't run to the Dizzy and order the braised lamb shanks with mashed potatoes and braised red cabbage.  

Oh my lord, it was so tasty...  The meat was like butter, falling off the bone, the sauce pungent and deep, the red cabbage was intense and appley (I know that's not a word) the mashed potatoes perfect and creamy...  Delicious! 

My brother had the Game and Tame burger which came with perfect herbed frites.  The burger was charred on the outside and pink on the inside (just the way I like it) and arrives topped with a portobello mushroom head, bacon and cheddar cheese.  Yes, it's decadent, but so good...

I love the booths here, they are very comfortable and big.  The only downside to the Dizzy is that it's a sports bar.  It stopped me from checking it for a long time, but I'm sure glad I found it.  What a gem on the Roncesvalles strip.

The staff is always friendly and it has a casual atmosphere.  I was so blown away by the meal that I requested a conversation with the chef who was more than happy to share all his tips on braising lamb and red cabbage, even going so far as to give me the name of the guy who supplies his meat.  Very sweet."}
{"text":"The food and staff are amazing! Favorite things are the steak, the burgers and the big booths in the back. It's like a modern Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years now. 

This is, in my opinion the best sports bar in the city. Really good beer. Amazing food. Lots of screens, and they make sure you have the game you want to watch on the screens near where you're sitting. 

The wings are nice and big, and finished on the grill. They do an amazing steak on Thursdays. The fries are amazing. Everything is top notch. 

But the thing I love the most about the Dizzy is it seems to me to be the only grear sports bar downtown. There are many other sports bars downtown, but all of them have at least one thing missing. Either it's too grimy and the food sucks, or it's too much of a lacquered King Street douche bar and they charge cover. The Dizzy is the perfect balance. Great food with the focus on whatever game is on that night. Simply put - it's what all sports bars should be and I'm not sure why there aren't more like this in the city. I've given up on the rest, and if I feel like going to a sportsbar - I just go to the DIzzy. I live in the core and it takes a 35min streetcar to get there, but it's truly the only proper place for beer, wings, nachos and to watch a game. So this is my go to. 5 stars all the way. Going now by the way."}
{"text":"Well one night I just happened to be in the bloor area visiting some friends, when all of a sudden I had a wing craving. So I asked my friend what's a good wing place in the area and she said that her boss had said there was a place that he consistently goes to for wings. It just happened to be the Dizzy. 

So we all decided to go out for wings. The moment we got there it  looked like all the other pubs/bars I've been to. Big screen T.Vs patio, booth fit for 5 and a bar of course. 

Now we were sitting right beside the kitchen/grill which was nice because I got to see what some of the other food looked like, and lets just say that they LOOKED amazing, The burgers were huge and I'm not just talking about the bread or the toppings the meat was huge. As well the steak there looked delicious. But that wasn't the reason we were there it was the wings.

They had five different flavours of wings which worked out b/c there was five of us so we each got a flavour. There was Texas BBQ which was my absolute favourite, the waitress warned my friend that it was spicy b/c she doesn't like spicy food but it was not spicy at all. A tie for second was Sweet chili thai which is a little spicy for some and honey garlic which was very well done not too saucy at all like some places where you're consistently licking or wiping off your hands. And the two worse ones were the classic buffalo style which anyone can make at home and blackened chicken. I don't know why people would order blackened chicken its just chicken that the chefs forgot about and burned! 

Besides the wings we got fries and a order of calamari. The fries were very good it had a bit of a cajun spice, the kind that you would put on at New York Fries, as well it came with The Dizzy's special sauce which was basically mayo. As for the calamari lets say the presentation of the plate was so much better than the actually taste, in a way it ruined my meal.

As we were leaving it started to get very busy roughly around 9:00, and lets just say that the only girls there were the waitresses and my two friends, this place is a definte guys hang-out. 

Items to order:

-Texas BBQ Wings
-Sweet Chili Thai Wings
- Honey Garlic Wings"}
{"text":"Delicious food for a bar!  Glorious little booths that are the perfect place for a quiet chat with some friends, as long as there's no big game going on.  I watched Obama's inauguration speech here, and it always has a special place in my heart.  The service is generally good, but I've been neglected a couple of times when the bar was virtually empty.  Keep an eye out for that stuff; if it happens, you may need to grab someone's attention to order and pay, and you won't be checked on, but they are always friendly."}
{"text":"The Dizzy is a great place if you're in the mood for a relaxing atmosphere. Its a perfect spot to watch sporting events too (lots of tv's) but there's something specifically romantic and calming about this place.

Couldn't ask for more polite and attentive servers. The food was incredible. I ordered a pasta and my date had the chicken sandwich and we both just loved it. The chefs here take good care of their customers. They offer weekday specials and a good variety of beers. Average pub menu and prices.

The best part is the cute patio out front where you can sit and enjoy the street life.

Check it out if you're in the Roncey area!"}
{"text":"So, The Dizzy. The food is great, service excellent and prices reasonable. The crowd? Let's just say it can get a little... ratchet. 

I've lived in the neighbourhood for almost two years now. Last summer a group of friends and I were walking past when one \"patron\" yelled that he 'liked chocolate'. I guess he felt he was being ignored because when we walked by again he let me know I was being complimented. To be fair, I didn't know or assume he was referring to a human being. I thought they served dessert! 

Today's visit to The Dizzy was overall pretty uneventful. My friends and I knew it was time to leave when a middle-aged white guy called his friend on the phone a 'nigga'. I almost ordered a second helping of wings and fries to take home and pig out on by myself, the food was that good / I was that hungry. And the waitress was really attentive.

If you ever decide to go you won't be disappointed in the food / service. And you might even get a little entertainment, free of charge!"}
{"text":"Used to be a fan many years ago. Gave it another try - and found it to be stuck in time with regulars (and one of the few patios) keeping it afloat.

Walked out after 15 or so minutes without service. They were really known for awesome service, great beer selection, and food. None of these appear to remain."}
{"text":"The only place I actually will go out JUST to eat wings. The wings are great, cheap (on half off mondays) and larger portions the most other places :) All in all, nice place, nice atmosphere. When me and friends are considering wings, this is where I insist we go!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Always a consideration for some grub and knocking down a few pints, this modest Gastropub is a gem along the Roncesvalles strip.

The atmosphere is comfortable and not one bad seat if your looking to watch a sporting event.  My preference is the curved booths which I would give up my first born child to sit in!  Remarkably we always seem to get the last one which offers a perfect view, plenty of space and you feel engaged with the rest of pub while still having privacy.

Expect Bistro pub prices on the food but don't let that fool you as they are worth the value.  The burgers rock, salads are refreshing, honey garlic wings rock and the fries are addictive. It's worth it check out the daily specials as I've been blown away in the past by the fish & chips and impressed by the pulled pork.

The wait staff is cute, friendly and competent, rarely do I have to make effort to get attention nor am I ever left with an empty glass. Speaking of which, there is a solid selection of beers from bottle and tap. This all completes a worthwhile experience, making it not only the the top choice for food, drinks and sports but one of the best spots in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Have not been here in a few years but went back with my family and had a good experience. Menu is smaller but still some interesting dish. 

Butter chicken and pierogi were excellent. Wings were solid, and the chicken fingers for the kids were pretty good. 

Good selection of beers on tap. 

Service was ok but not excellent."}
{"text":"This is my local, a Roncesvalles institution, and I love it. It is the perfect place to just chill, watch some sportballs, and eat some truly decent food that is made with way more care than your average pub.

The Dizzy from the outside has a collection of patrons either on the patio or grabbing some air, with a few dogs tied up outside hanging out. Inside, the atmosphere is just as relaxed - dark pub styles with sports paraphernalia, big booths, and a bookcase of pop culture curios. The game will be on and there's always a handful of armchair coaches at the bar discussing sports. The clientele is a real mix of young and old.

Staff are friendly and the service has never been bad. The food is the other highlight - for how chill and pubby the place is, it serves up real food and has a solid, balanced menu of the usual starter suspects like nachos and wings, fresh salads you won't be nervous to order, and sandwiches, burgers and entrees (the butter chicken and steak frites are both solid choices). There are also lots of specials throughout the week - everything seems to be made using fresh ingredients and you don't leave the place with that \"ugggh, pub food\" heaviness. 

Lastly, in a quickly changing neighborhood, the Dizzy has been around for a long time and while many newer offerings on Roncesvalles try (and some struggle) to integrate into the character of the area, the Dizzy is a longstanding part of that character - and I love to support businesses that care about the community they're in. For all these reasons, I regularly head to the Dizzy to get my pub fix. JUS DO IT K?!"}
