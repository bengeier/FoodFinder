{"text":"Food was good. Was a lot of food too. I got the chimmi with beef and green chilli. 

Seating is very tight. So if ur really fat not the place to be. 

The service was bla... Only saw the waitress 3times. (When she took our order, brought out our food and took our check) didn't get refills ."}
{"text":"I love this place. I recommend it all the time. 

However, I always....and I mean ALWAYS have to explain to people that this is \"not the place with the little flag that gets you more tacos\" 

This restaurant has a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"Everytime my husband and I fly down to Phoenix, Az. We have a tradition to order food here and eat it while watching the beautiful sunset on top of South Mountain. I am happy to say this place brings nothing but happy/cherished memories while living in Phoenix before moving to Salt Lake City. I would recommend this place to anyone requesting a great place to eat/order out."}
{"text":"So, this place is like my family's tradition, yet today was the first time I've ever tried it (or the first time I remember trying it...) Anyways, it was great! We sat and ate in the bar, which at first looked kinda dingy, but it actually has pretty decent decoration. We were served right when we got there (we came when it opened up) and our server was really nice! She deserves to be mentioned by name, but I don't remember it.... sorry! Anyways, the menu was big but not-too-big, of you know what I mean. I ended up getting the shredded chicken chimichanga, and I also tried some of the Pollo Fundido (spelling?) and both were DELICIOUS! Yes, the portions are HUGE! It is imminent that you will fall into a food coma, even if you have a full box of leftovers to take home. It was a tad greasy, but it's fried mexican food, what do you expect? In conclusion, I say that it's my new favorite mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent service!! Pollo fundido was mouth watering!! Salsa and chips are always 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Went to Ponchos while in town on vacation upon the reviews of locals who recommended it.  
 First, the setting.  The place seems to be somebody's old house, with 5 or 6 small rooms (bedrooms maybe?) off from one hallway.  Luckily, we were seated in what was probably the living room at one time.  The largest room in the place.  It really reminded me of Thanksgiving at my Aunts place when I was a kid.  Too many people in a dinky house.
  Service was OK, we were greeted, drink orders taken, and a basket of chips with sauce brought.  Our server returned within probably 5 minutes to take our order.  Not overly friendly, strictly business.
 I ordered the chicken chimi with red sauce, the wife ordered the same with green sauce.  Found out later the green sauce was loaded with onions (possibly the reason i had to make a bee line back to Walgreens for Immodium after arriving back at our condo). Both dinners came loaded with beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce and tomato. A ton of food, which we both finished half, and left with to go boxes.  The Chimi did leave me wondering if they make them wrong back in Michigan, as it was not deep fried and crispy. Back home, what I had is called a wet burrito.  Any who...the thing was LOADED with shredded chicken, and pretty tasty.  
 I have always looked forward to trying authentic Mexican food in the Southwest, and was a bit disappointed that it wasn't  a \"wow\" thing.  Have had better back in Grand Rapids. Not that it was bad, just not up to the hype.  And yeah, Bill Clinton ate there 15 years ago.
 Have always looked for an opportunity to say this on the web. Meh."}
{"text":"We always order from here and typically get the same thing all the time, we went to pick up  our order tonight and they had 3 cheese crisp (we only ordered 1) 2 tacos which were correct and the other two we asked to have without lettuce they just put meat no cheese. They had the nerve to say we were wrong and that's what we ordered they actually said we called back and added! Which is insane and pathetic because we surely did not. They argued and we paid and after we paid they said we already paid for the stuff anyways so we had to take. No way we are going to eat 3 open cheese crisp. We went to find a couple homeless people and gave to them because it would have went to waste. They get zero stars I will not be going there again. I can only imagine how bad hey are with people. Thanks for nothing!!!"}
{"text":"Poncho's is an Arizona institution, and has the best Mexican food in town!  Whenever we are craving authentic Mexican food, Ponchos is our first choice!  In fact, we recently took some visiting relatives from back east and they loved it and can't stop racing about the food!  I would highly recommend Ponchos to anyone looking for a great Mexican food experience."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever!! We will not be returning. We were recommended this place by some friends so we decided to try it.
1) the place was overly crowded and tables are extremely close to each other.
2) the host didn't even greet us and seemed in a bad mood as she was walking us to our table. 
3) our server took over 20minutes to ask what we wanted to drink and took another 10min to bring them to us by then we were ready to order. 
4) another server brang out our food but we were never advised that she was our new server so we sat there waiting for the server we had initially no where to be found.(the food was nothing special by the way)
5) when we finally realized we had a new server she took FOREVER to bring us our check she came and went around our table over 5 times every time we would make eye contact so I can get her attention she would look away fast and walk away this made me super angry so we finally got up and headed to look for a manager we ended up bumping into her and she said she will get our check immediately. 
H0RRIBLE. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Even though there are not too many authentic Mexican food restaurants Poncho's Mexican Food has to be the most memorable! This is a restaurant is located near south phoenix and the exterior is very creative and has the feel of a home. The interior is about the same as the outside because the restaurant was originally a home. I really enjoyed the food it was filled with various flavors, the serving size was perfect even though I had some left overs. The service was okay because our food took a while to come out and we rarely saw the waitress. However the food was well worth the wait, I would recommend trying it at least once because the food is not something a person should not miss."}
{"text":"Really good food! Only thing is the inside is kind of strange, tons of hallways and different rooms, looks like it was probably a house before it became a restaurant. Not the best in on the inside but the food is good"}
{"text":"This place is freaking amazing. My boyfriend grew up eating there so he craves it from time to time. I've only eaten inside once and we usually get take out but it's so good. He gets the red chili burro and I get green chili. We also order a cheese crisp folded and side of chips and salsa. Yes all in one order, I seat half the next day. Highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Service was good. Had the chimichanga it was very good. Great atmosphere and very clean. I would eat here every day if possible."}
{"text":"The food is good but what kills my review is the wait time, size of dining area/bathroom, and the temperature difference in each area of the house. Cold in one room and hot in another. I use to go here at least 2x a month but because of all this.... it's been at least a year since I've visited them. I use to think it was the best I ever had but not coming and venturing out---I've found even better Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Mexican Food, not the best in Phoenix. I ordered a chile relliano , green corn Tamale,  enchilada platter and found the food bland, not very tasty.  Much better places for Mexican food in the valley."}
{"text":"Green chicken tamale was amazing.  Perfect moisture.  Not to salty.  The kernels of corn added sweetness to it. There was a nice manageable amount of masa. The thing was like crack. Could not get enough.   Also had the
Chicken chile relleno.  Which was amazing tasting..       

The only downside was being tucked away in a broom closet with three other tables.      And cheddar cheese?     Go with some authentic Mexican cheese and it would have been perfect.   Eat here eat here. Cause dang its good."}
{"text":"This place was ok but then again I am a true Mexican wouldn't call it the best Mexican restaurant but it was decent"}
{"text":"went after reading positive reviews and craving authentic mexican food. BUT this was HORRIBLE. Staples like chips and salsa were stale and bland respectively. But to make matters worse, my fajita was the most disgusting thing ever. The chicken was fried to the point that I could not chew it, and the veggies were covered in grease, and the whole thing was cooked in Soy Sauce! Is that traditional?? It was a nasty overall experience..."}
{"text":"I have been eating at poncho's for years. The food is great and the prices are very reasonable. They have a good lunch selection. I love the chicken tacos!!"}
{"text":"Poncho's is this native's favorite Mexican place, by far!! You just don't get any better than this. Simple, fast, cheap food served by super nice people. The place is no-frills but clean and casual. People are overstating the divey-ness of it, it's not that bad. I find it to be very relaxing and comfortable. Truly though, the food is what keeps me coming back for many years. Get a simple bean burrito with a side of rice and you'll see what I mean. Love, love, love this place. Getting hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"I found out about Ponchos since the early 70's , it was good then as it is now and now i live 5 minutes away and go there about once a week, love it ...."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Everything was great from the salsa to my main dish which was the pollo fundido with extra jalapeño sauce. I recommend you ask to be seated at the cantina side as it has a great atmosphere, and even if you don't drink you will enjoy the music."}
{"text":"Food good quality however the waitress was loud and obnoxious. Someone with the hospitality of a bowling alley snack bar attendant . I don't understand how the owners would hire her . The reputation of the restaurant is at risk ."}
{"text":"The service isnt amazing, but its the best Mexican food in the world. Just my opinion but its good old Sonoran style cooking and I just love it.  Their hot sauce, rice and beans are second to none.  Theres really nothing bad on the menu, only bad for you.  It is one of my favorite places ever."}
{"text":"I love the food here!  Ive always shared the combo plates that lets you get a taste of everything.  Definetly fills you up.  My only complaint is the entry way/waiting room.  They need to widen it so people can actually walk thru while other people wait.  Am definetly going back!"}
{"text":"There is a reason this was the place picked by President Clinton on his trip to Phoenix. The food is authentic. I recommend the pollo fundito. I would caution travelers. The ambiance is second rate and the neighborhood is quite sketchy. Definitely a day visit place.  Lines get long after five and the weekends."}
{"text":"Having been to Poncho's many times over the years, and never being to excited about their food and service, we happened to be out and about, and hungry Saturday 11/1 around 9pm. I remembered Poncho's serves food late, so we stopped in to give it a try. 

The place we packed. Hardly an empty table which seemed like a good sign.
Service took quite a while, but there were several large parties around us, (one who clearly never heard of \"inside voices\", but rather \"screaming voices\") so they were busy. A simple \"hello, be right with you\" would have been nice though, as opposed to being completely ignored.

We loved the screaming child next to us, who the parents ignored and chose to drink many beers instead of correcting his behaviur. When he knocked some holiday decorations off the wall, the parents simply set them on the floor and went back to their beer. ( not the fault of Poncho's, but indicative of the typical clientele.
I asked about beers on tap, and was told \"Bud, Bud light, Miller). Seeems like a Mexican restaurant would have some Dos xx's , Tecate or something, but no.
 We asked how the quesadilla was, and were assured it was fantastic, so we had that, and 2 different combo plates.

 Well, the \"quesadilla\" was simply 2 heated tortillas with greasy runny orange cheese. No sides, no toppings, just orange goo.

Our entrees were no better. The beans were bland and tasteless, and were the burritos.. It was like eating air. 
The beef taco was HORRIBLE. I literally watched oil run out of it as i held it up.
I voiced my concerns, but was just given a shrug by the waitress.

I used the bathroom, which was a wreck, dirty and no paper towels or soap, and headed out their door for the last time.

I have never understood how people can rave about this place, but they can have it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Don't expect quick service, but you can't go wrong with the shredded beef tacos and the pollo fundido. They are exceptionally delicious. I get weekly cravings for this place. Their bottled sarsaparilla (root beer) is so good too."}
{"text":"Today the manager for the take out window was so rude and condescending that I was floored. Not only were \"her girls\" as she put it were disorganized, but I did not receive a platter that I had ordered a week prior for our traditional Christmas party. This was the first time in twenty years that we did not have a platter for Christmas. And I received not a single apology for the oversight. I received nothing but attitude. I suppose she had to substitute attitude for a lack of attention to customer service. We will certainly not be returning to Poncho's for our holiday p"}
{"text":"I ate here last spring and ordered the chicken fajitas. I was served rubbery chicken that seemed to been cooked in pure salty soy sauce. My dad ordered the steak fajitas...again with the soy sauce. I was with some vegetarians (I don't remember what they ordered) but they were pretty meh about their food as well. For the 9-10$ the fajitas cost, I was expecting a little more than soy sauce seasoning.

The actual place is pretty cute and they have various rooms that are decorated well. The service was ok. The chips and salsa were the best thing about the meal. I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"You had me at hello. You had me at hello...

For me (and my dad), I am all about first impressions, and if you have bad salsa than I am not likely going to return. Or if you make me PAY for my chips and salsa--FAIL!

Pancho's salsa rocks the house! 

Their food is great and call me crazy, but I like eating in their seedy bar. 

Their frozen margs arent too bad either.

If you want authenticity--this is the place!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here. We went on Saturday night, 01/06/18. What a huge disappointment! I ordered the President's platter of mini items. The only thing edible was one miniature taco. Never in my life have I had a green corn tamale that I didn't like...until Ponchos! I can't even describe the taste other than to say it was NOTHING like a green corn tamale. The chimis were way over fried. The filling was disgusting....tasted like red chili powder. The \"chunky\" salsa was gross and I had to request it twice before knowing how bad it was. Maybe they can fool white folks, but this Latina wasn't happy. My roommate ordered the fajitas. No sizzling platter. The beef was obviously overcooked as were the peppers and onions....and it all tasted like teriyaki sauce...WAIT...where am I? Oh yeah, in a MEXICAN food restaurant, not an Asian restaurant. The rice and beans were good! I was praying the waitress would not utter the words, \"did you like your food\", but alas she did! My roommate immediately said \"no\", and this is a man who rarely complains. At least they did not charge for my meal. None the less, I will never step foot in Ponchos again! The food at Federico's on 35th Ave and Baseline is a 1000% better."}
{"text":"Best cheese crisps and chicken tacos! I'm really picky so everything else on the menu is average tasting! Pollo fundido is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Quick getting seated. Friendly staff. The food came out so fast and it was delicious. I got the pollo fondito, which is supposedly \"everyone's favorite\" but I have to be honest, it was good but not the best. My fiancé got the el crudo and it was great! I'll definitely be coming back to try other dishes, though!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST mexican food in the valley. Beans are the BEST. Enchilada's and folded Tacos are very good. Pollo Fundido is very very tasty. I usually stick to my usual routine: the \"Muchas Cosas\" plate: cheese enchilada, folded taco (i always get beef), bean tostada, beans, rice &amp; a flower tortilla. You can't beat it. I really like this place, although it can get very busy and customer service can be hit or miss, but overall they are all pretty friendly and helpful. My only complaint, not really a complaint, just a preference, is that I love the FLAVOR of the salsa, but prefer chunkier salsa w/ fresh cilantro. But the salsa they have is GREAT in folded tacos. The chips are good, but i prefer thicker chips, but again, thats just a preference.

They are ALWAYS busy, so get there early (or wait til later to go). They have a take-out window if your in a hurry. Don't even worry about the neighborhood. We just moved near south Phoenix from Chandler, and its fine. The ambiance inside is awesome and the hostess is normally very friendly. 

You just can't go wrong here. A++++ food!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Comfy, friendly and great food. The way Mexican restaurants used to be.  No pico de gallo here.  Good rich and smooth salsa with a nice bite. Hot chips, as much as you want. Everything I have tried is way above average. Try it you will like it."}
{"text":"Really gone downhill. The smell was awful, I could barely finish my food. Food was good, buts its really become rundown. I've been coming here since I was a child, but I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I use to come here a lot with family, and the food is delicious, but the customer service is a hit and miss. There  needs to be consistency with how diners are greeted. My complaint is about the lack of customer service I received yesterday. I called my order in over the phone, and when I arrived to pick it up; I was told that it would be coming out shortly. 30 minutes later....yes 30 minutes (although I called ahead) I had to ask one of the ladies behind the to-go counter where was my food. She asked me for my order, and once I repeated it; she said \"Oh here it is; sorry about that ma'am.\" So basically I waited outside for 30 minutes for my food that was ready and just sitting on the counter. She was so engrossed in her conversation with her co-workers that she forgot to call my order??  I can't with this place...bad customer service can ruin a business reputation, and it seems that SOME of the employees there are on a mission to do just that."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Good food, so it is always busy. Unfortunate they prove they don't need any more business with the way they treat their guests."}
{"text":"Ew to poor service and less than desireable food!  No bueno"}
{"text":"Went there with a group of about 8 people.  I ordered a 'big' margarita...which actually wasn't bad.  The food on the menu looked good, but I was not a fan of the chips and salsa.  I know most people rave about it...but the whole squeeze bottle salsa was actually too thin for me.  I like my salsa chunky so that I can dig in with my chips.  Anyways, I ordered the my food and was happy with it.  It was very good.  Probably worth 4 stars in my book, but since I only gave this restaurant 3 stars your probably wondering why only 3 of you just said it's worth 4 stars.  Well the reason I knocked it down was because of the service.  Just not very good at all.  Our service seemed irritated everytime we asked for anything.  She only came to check on us 1 time during the whole meal.  We had to get up ourselves and go to the kitchen to get a side of sour cream and our own napkins.  I'll try them again to see if maybe she was just the bad apple of the bunch."}
{"text":"Food was just plain awful and it was like eating in a filthy basement. How do places like this stay in business?"}
{"text":"I call this... \"Ode To The Only Resturant I Truely Love\"

My parents went to school with the owner's kids. They remember when it was a walk-up window take out place. Infact, when my father picked my mother and I up from the hospital after I was born, the FIRST stop they made on the way back to the rez was Poncho's! 

One of the co-owners likes to laugh and say that she saw me before most of my family did! I went from being in a car seat gurgling as my relatives chomped on the best chips in town served with some awesome hot sauce that hasn't really changed since I was young. To being a little girl who always ordered the deep friend tortilla wrapped hot dogs with crinkle cut french fries and the BEST coldest ketchup I ever had!! To being a young woman who brought every single close friend I met while being away at school or through the native pageant circuit to enjoy the wonders that is \"The Works\". 

My FAVORITE meal there is the cheese crisp as an appetizer, Combination #18 which is two tacos (i always order beef!), rice & beans. They have the best beans EVER!! And the rice is awesome too! I've had all the desserts on their menu and nothing really jumps out at me. I guess I still love the family tradition of going to the water & ice cream shop for thrifty ice cream before heading home! 

I have had many experiences at this resturant. I've held my high school graduation party there; this resturant was the place where I signed a contract that made me the goodwill ambassador of my people for nearly a year; it was from their bar that I had my first LEGAL margarita on my 21st birthday, it was also the place where my then boyfriend got on one knee and asked me to marry him, and it was their waitresses who said \"to HELL with him!!\" when we ended our engagement. 

It's a wonderful place to me, I like that I can go in and say \"Hi Marty!\" to their one time waitress who now manages the resturant. and have her yell, \"HI CHERYL!!\" Yes... that's right!! That's how long she has known me!! She can call me Cheryl and get away with it!! I also love the other long time co-owners/managers. There is one that always wants to buy a certain piece of jewelry off of me. And another who always laughes when I bring someone new in. 

Poncho's is a place of regulars... LONG time regulars. and i think this is what every great restuant needs. Local, long time regulars who grow with the restuant. Who bring in new friends to enjoy the huge wonderful chimichangas or the Presidential Special and laugh over delicious enchiladas while a secret service agent (who kinda looks like leslie nealson if u ask me) painted on the wall watches on. While a bustling resturant does what it does best: offer homestyled, friendly, affordable and great food to it's old time regulars and it's about-to-become regulars."}
{"text":"The food is good, the restaurant is absurdly filthy.

Disgustingly dirty, slow and uncaring wait staff, you typically get sat next to either a table full of screaming kids, or a group that believes loud profanity leads to stimulating dinner conversation.

My strong suggestion - get your food as takeout. It is a shame this restaurant is operated the way it is. There is absolutely no reason for the third world conditions."}
{"text":"We just left ponchos, haven't been there in about a year the food has gone down, The chicken chimichanga was very salty, the Sonora style enchiladas Patty was very hard couldn't cut it with a knife, The green chili look like slop, the service has gone down.  It was my favorite place to go but not anymore!!"}
{"text":"I don't remember the last time I walked out of a restaurant and actually prayed to throw up. My friend and I ended up spending the next 15mins in the parking lot hoping to be rid of the food!!! I whould NOT recommend going there, unless all you're after is quantity!!!"}
{"text":"Although i love Ponchos and the food is awesome, i hate the take out girls. They mess up every time we get take out. They have no respect for customers and employees. I don't feel comfortable calling and complaining every time and i mean EVERY TIME, they forget something in my bag or mess the whole order up. I live in laveen and by time i get home I'm not going back for a mistake that happens way too often. Example: I go yesterday to get our evening dinner. Made it simple but we did order a lot. I paid with my credit card. Well i checked my bag before i left the window. Strike 1: half pint of chili i ordered wasn't in there, but they insisted it was. Oops try again. Strike 2:  I ask for my receipt, not credit card receipt but the food receipt showing what i ordered. Response to that was well ummmmmmm when you use your credit card the only receipt you get is the transaction one you sign. My response is no that's wrong i want my food receipt. She refused. Strike 3: when she closed the window on my face. WWJD? Walk away i guess. I had my hands full, my two kids with me and I was very tired. I'm over it. Take out window will not see me for a while. I hope Ponchos management looks into a customer service class for these ladies, because these ladies acting like that now at such a young age will find out real soon when life hits them as adults, that they need to be CLASSY."}
{"text":"hey folks I love this place grew up in the area and it is awesome!! There was a review in 12-10 you may read over it but i totally disagree. Everytime i go there i see someone i know and service is fun loving and freindly! Today im having take out just eat at home 3-way burro ench style yummy with 2 hard tacos. Hey the bar is awesome and if cryng baby's bother you while dining in thats the place to b. C a current b-ball or football game and drink away the days stress with that huge tasty strawberry daquri! And if you're not drinking it's a family rest. so people of all ages eat and enjoy this place... even the little cryng ones."}
{"text":"I used to come here once a week, sometimes more, i always get four tacos and albondigas soup. Slowly but surely every time it got worse. A few months ago there albondigas tasted like BBQ sauce... ew that is not how it is supposed to taste.. and yesterday I was hoping everything would get better.. but when my boyfriend opened our albondigas.. there was no soup/ juice. It was just rice and meat. No broth or anything.. it was really salty and they were really hard to cut through. 
And they also changed the size of their hot sauce.. so now it's even tinier and they still don't give you enough. I don't think I will be returning.."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed by the food or experience. We had a long wait but not enough room in the \"lobby.\" It's a converted house so I like the character of the place. However, our service was extremely loud-for no reason-the food was just bleh, and my husband's fajitas was saucy (why, I don't know). His meat was over cooked. The highlight? The margaritas were amazing! I may go back for happy hour but probably not for food."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in South Phoenix. There are others good, some great but Pancho is my heart."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here again,and as expected the bomb!!! If you like mexican food go to ponchos the pollo fundido is to die for!!  The service is awesome."}
{"text":"My friend and I  love our  Friday night  diners.....we start with a LG margarita on the rocks. Then the food...bring it on......great Times......."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill.  We went there tonight to celebrate my best friends birthday with some yummy food and margaritas.  We left there 3 hours after having gotten there beyond disappointed.  First they wrote down the wrong name for us so when they called, we didn't say anything and they gave our table away.  We asked them the status an hour after being there and their response was oh well we called you, now you have to wait.  They admitted they just wrote a random name down and didn't even ask us if maybe that was our party. We finally get squeezed into a booth made for 4 people, we have 7 in our party....we didn't fit...shocker.  they got us another table and then took 10 minutes to take our drink order and brought us the wrong drinks. Our server was nowhere to be found and we had to tell one of the bussers to let her know we were ready.  By now we had been there for over 1.5 hours.  She takes our order and disappears again, comes back to take the other tables order and disappears again.  30 mins after that, she brings the other table their appetizer, which happened to be the same as ours, and disappears again.  Never once checking on us, no refills, no chips...nothing.  when she finally comes back with the food, we mention the appetizer and she's less than apologetic and says I guess I can get it for you for free.  Now, after over 2 hours of being there, our party finally getting our meals, she says to me, \"oh we don't have what you ordered. It's not my fault but you can get something else if you want\".  Horrible. I asked for the manager who decides she will just comp our food instead of coming to talk to me.  I left there, after being there for 3 hours, hungry, upset and frustrated.  I've been going to Ponchos for years but I don't think I will ever go back again.  Shame because I used to love it."}
{"text":"It's good place to eat but it can be a bit too greasy.  The service is good.  They have good margaritas and it's a good place to hang out and have a bite.  I think there are better options to check out like Garcias or Comedor.   But no complaints just which the food is a bit too greasy and you can feel it once you're done eating.  But if you're into that type of food and margaritas this might be up your alley."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for Mexican food in south Phoenix. The Mexican pizza is very yummy even for a last minute late dinner."}
{"text":"We ate here in July 2013. I heard great things about their nachos. They really were good!! However, after being blown away by the nachos, I was a little disappointed with our main entree. I wasn't sure, but the rice and beans weren't as good as other places.... but this might be a location thing. 

I will definitely go back to just eat nachos!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch not happy with my lunch enchilada was cold, my tostada was ok. Sticking with chips and salsa from now on."}
{"text":"Today was not a good day. For a Sunday it wasn't as busy as I expected but today it's my daughters birthday and we wanted good Mexican food. The waitress was very nice, a little busy but nice it's her birthday too. I think their bus boys quit because the table next to ours has yet to be cleared and it's going on 30 minutes, so this fly has found an excuse to circle around us. I'm not giving her two stars I'd give her five, but whoever is managing should be written up because there's really no excuse. We felt like we were eating in the kitchen. Just got the check and ready to go...still no bus boys :-("}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for lunch. I got two things a-la carte: the beef tamale and chicken enchilada because I love them both and there was not a combo for both items. I had the red and green sauces on the side. The tamale was alright. It came out of the husk which made the outside a little drier than usual. The enchilada was better of the two in my opinion. And I actually like the salsa that came with the chips better than the red or green sauce - go figure. Also, the large margarita is a good size. It was much bigger than I expected. 

Service was quick and friendly. And the prices were soo cheap. 

I might come back and try some more things because my friend that I came with raved about the cheese crisp and burittos...and Bill Clinton visited too!"}
{"text":"I don't understand some of the bad reviews here. I have been driving to South Phx for years just to eat a Pollo Fundido at Ponchos. Last night we took a couple of friends who had never been. We have not been in over a year. Everything was great. Service, food was exactly as is always has been. Friends love what they ordered, one the beef chimi, the other pollo fundido. The totally enjoyed it as did I.
I would highly recemmend this place as I always have. Its a family restaurant, cozy fun atmosphere. you  might wait a bit on a friday night and the bar is noisy, but it has a fun vibe ."}
{"text":"I ordered hardshell tacos from the take out here today and they were very good. I tried this place after a friend recommended it and was happy with the tacos. Will have to try a few other menu items to get a better overall picture of what is available here."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with 5 of the girls. I was hoping that this would be one of those mexican food places that had kept the food tasty even after all the good cooks were run out of AZ by Apairo and his gang of thugs. Since this was my first time here I don't have anything to compare the taste too, but they only get 1 star for a reason....I couldn't give them no stars. The place was packed at 11:30 on Good Friday so the service was slow, but I expected that. What I didn't expect was the blandness of the food, not just 1 item, but everything we ate. It started with the chips and hot sauce (anyone heard of El Pato sauce?). When asked if they had anything hotter or spicier, the answer was no. When asked by one of the girls which was hotter, the red or green sauce the answer was neither. As Judge Judy would say, \"Get where i'm going with this?\" I ordered a cheese crisp, it came out as a cheese limp. One of the girls ordered a side of guacamole. She said it had more sour cream in it than avocado. None of the food was seasoned. Then to add insult they added 18% gratuity to a party of 6! We left and won't make the long trek back. Bill Clinton has left the building and probably won't be back. Save yourself a disappointing experience and go to La Pinata instead."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch on a Saturday. We were seated immediately. Chips and salsa arrived soon after and the waitress took our drink and food order. Food came out hot and timely and was very good. We were in and out in less than 45 mins and for only $27 w/o tip! Great place. Very authentic. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile because of poor customer service and inconsistent quality of food. We were in the area so we decided to give it another try. Let me say first that I've been here numerous times for lack of knowing anything else and because of loyalty. We grew up eating here with parents and grandparents. This was always our go to place. The waitress this trip was nonetheless unaccommodating when placing our order. That's also a reason why we stopped going in the first place. She ended up getting it wrong but, we didn't want to wait for them to get it right. I always order the Pollo Fundido and it was delicious. This was actually the first time I remember it being hot. The only reason I give 3 stars is because of poor customer service."}
{"text":"I've found my new home! If your like me and you are drawn to places that are a mix of color, character, funk and a touch of danger, this is the place! 
I've driven by numerous times, I didn't even know if was a sit down restaurant, because I always say a line of people ordering from the takeout window at the front. Craving some good mex food, I was going to hit up one of my regular places, but decided to try somewhere real close, and ponchos came up.. Walked past the line of large parties waiting to get in, they had some tables for one in the back. I walked past a very eclectic mix of people, bikers, couples, tourists, and what seemed to be a lot of regulars. The atmosphere, decor, smells and sounds transport me to a place of sheer happiness.
The Food: I probably could have been served a tv dinner and still loved this place... Chips and a full bottle of salsa appeared seconds after I sat down. It took me 4 bites to decide that I liked the peppery salsa, but by the end of my meal, only a half inch remained, I realize this may be something I will crave if I ever have to go more than a few weeks without. 
For my main, I chose the pollo fundido, as it seems that is the go to dish here. It really was fantastic. Not complicated, greasy, or light, just simply delicious! 
For a beverage, I had a small margarita, which had no price, listed. When info the bill it was only $4.00 which was a nice surprise. 
After cleaning my plate, I just wanted to sit back and enjoy the vibe, listen to the ranchero music, and pretend I was an actor in a Tarantino/Rodriguez movie. 
So if your in town on a smoldering saturday night, you'll likely find me here indulging a neon green bowl o happiness and an empty bottle of salsa."}
{"text":"The food is alright.. Their take out service is terrible. 1, the restaurant menu is not the same as their take out menu.  2, the setup for pick up is like a cheap fast food walk up window. 
3, the cashiers are rude.

Check Comedor Guadalajara . Much better place."}
{"text":"OMG!  Had I known that Bill Clinton dined here I would not have gone !
But I must say the food was fantastic!  The beans were great!  Had to wait
for a table longer than I would have liked.  But I'm glad I did.  This is ins
South Phoenix, so it was a little bit of a drive.  However, with the freeway
just north of it, it's really not bad.  25 minutes for good Mexican food ?
I'd do that all day!  I only hope I didn't sit where you know who did!"}
{"text":"I love this place and drive about 20 miles just to eat here it has great food and great places. I always get the pollo fundidio and it is delicious every time. I have been going here for about 10 years."}
{"text":"Poncho's....WOW! This place is soooo good! I love it...If it's good enough for President's to come eat here, it's good enough for me! You better come hungry though, because the portions are huge..I always have to get a to go box followed by a food coma..."}
{"text":"Just moved here and this was Mmy first non-chain restaurant in Phoenix. Loved the chips. Loved the squirt bottle of red sauce on the table. Yummy smokey flavor. I want to marry that sauce. My flauta was a bit overcooked, but tried other peoples dishes and they were great. I'm craving the green tamale right NOW. Best of all was the service. Very friendly. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We have gone to this so called Mexican restaurant. And one time we saw roaches on the wall . everyone that Was sitting in that area . including us we left ."}
{"text":"The WORST dining experience I've had, since moving to Arizona, last year. My wife, stepdaughters, and I waited, for twenty minutes, before anyone took our order, while people who walked in AFTER us were seated, had their order taken, and received their food. The food was microwaved, and overcooked. I would like to believe that our \"waitress\" was just having a bad night, and that her poor execution of her job had nothing to do with the color of our skin...but that's highly unlikely...
Oh yeah...two employees walked through the dining area with a garbage can...nice, huh?"}
{"text":"If you want a family night out to Mexican food...this is the place!

Pros: Not too pricey, great amount food for the price, great drink specials (21+), outside quick to-go order window.

Cons: Be prepared for long wait times Thursday-Saturday, small waiting area, no parking, small water cups (you have to keep waiving a waiter down to get a refill) 

Overall great spot to take the kids and family"}
{"text":"Disgusting atmosphere.  Food was mediocre, but in my table of four, the other three people all received their food while I waited about 25 minutes for mine. No apology or anything. I didn't even want it by the time it came since everyone was already done eating. 
This was after about an hour wait to even sit down
The staff was rather unpleasant looking and acting, dirty carpet and just nasty in general. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"When you call a day in advance to order a party platter, you expect to have it ready by the quoted time.

They lost our order and we had to wait for them to make it.

Not professional, but the food is good."}
{"text":"Exploring new places close to our home. Decided to take in this Mexican restaurant that look like it was always busy. We came through the back which basically was the bar entrance and had to walk through the restaurant which was divided into sections and we had a hard time finding the front entrance. When I found the front entrance it was a small crowded hallway with a bench seat provided. We got seated within 10 minutes even though the host told another couple that it was going to be 20 minutes. That couple stepped outside and lost their place in line. The atmosphere of the seating arrangements were either bench seats or chairs. I ordered the pollo fundido which when I bit into it was excellent but after a while the chicken taste like it was from a can. The waitress was pretty good about filling our drinks but never asked me if I wanted another wine. I would definitely go back to this place to try other foods."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars only because I enjoyed the chips and salsa. I ordered a combo of a Tostado,enchilada and A tamale. The tostado shell was overcooked, the enchilada was unremarkable and the Tamale had very little meat in it and tasted just like the enchilada . . I honestly had one bite of everything on my plate and then pushed it aside. My son ordered something else and he did not eat his meal either. My daughter in law had a green chili burrito and she loved it. So if you must go to this place try and order that. I wont be going back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant my whole life.  If you're love authentic Mexican food, then you must try them, they are worth the drive.  The food is delicious, the prices are great!"}
{"text":"We live in Tempe, my wife works in Phoenix and we both make the trip to Poncho's for lunch and sometimes dinner. It is worth the drive as their food is by far, the BEST! We've been coming here since 1991, and yes, several new places have come and gone, but the best remains. The food and service are second to none. We even bring out of town visitors here to show them what quality tastes like. I hope they stay around for another 30 years as I WILL be here!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and I consider it to be authentic. The chips and salsa are addicting! Ponchos loses two stars because the service is always very bad.  I have gone to Ponchos several times for several years so I know what to expect...poor service! My friends and I went today and the service we received from the waitress was no different than prior visits...poor! However, Louie should have been our waiter! He is actually the busboy and was more helpful than our waitress!! Louie took very good care of us...very simple requests our waitress didn't even come around to ask, more napkins, chips and one refill on our drinks.  So my friends and I agree....ASK FOR LOUIE!!!!"}
{"text":"Meatballs in albóndigas were raw.  I called the place since it was pick up and they said all of their albóndigas are always that red in color.  Very disappointed as they didn't offer to correct the problem."}
{"text":"I love this place so much , my mother in law was the first person I had gone here with and now me and my fiancé are HOOKED ! So good , I know the wait is super long but it's so worth it ! I'm obsessed with the chimys  will be at ponchos this Thursday with the hubby ! Yesssss"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere because the servers and bus-boys are always fooling around with you and having fun, and their service is ok,but this place still has many problems. 
 
First is the room inside, this place makes lots of money and it would be nice to have a little more room inside. 
 
I have been coming here my whole life and the food is always good, but you get a sense that this place isn't as sanitary as it should be. 
 
In the past i would recomend this place a lot but after hearing a lot of stories from friends and recent experiences i have decided not to come anymore, and recomend you do the same."}
{"text":"How has this place stayed in business for 36 years serving the weirdest, unauthentic Mexican food ever presented on a plate? It might be because Bill Clinton ate here in 1999 and they are still getting food tourists? Not sure, but I did snap a photo of Clinton's table and that earned the extra star. The place is a mishmosh of small rooms and is old looking, but seemingly it retains its customers somehow, The guy next to us said he has been eating here once a week for the past 20 years and the waitress must have been here from day one. Have you ever heard of a waitress being too efficient, doing her job too good - kinda weird concept, but maybe somebody will get it.
    Even though, waitress informed pop that the fajitas were cooked in Teriayki sauce (WTF?), she said they were good and he took the veteran's bait. Big Mistake because our regular told us later that they just cook the chicken in Worcesthire sauce. His plate was swimming in salty, black liquid, only one tortilla was given, the guac had no chunks and looked like green toothpaste and the original salsa served with the chips was a watery mess of slightly hot red liquid (nothing in it). The $1 chunky salsa was better, but still on par with a chain or something (no offense to the much better chains in the area). 
    My $9 combo was a mess covered in a tasteless green sauce. The enchilada tasted like stale tortillas were used and the green corn tamale was all fluff and no green chile or corn present. The chile Relleno might have been the best item, but they used a green chile, not the traditional poblano.
     Pancho needs a break, a new menu and can someone mention to them how to cook fajitas properly because that crap should be taken off the menu forever. Clueless restaurant and even more clueless people who think this is real Mexican food. It aint."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant expecting great Mexican food, but left quite disappointed. Our 'baseline' Mexican food restaurant of choice is Los Dos Molinos and Poncho's is no where near as good (when comparing, service, alcohol, food and ambiance). The margaritas at Poncho's are made with a generic margarita mix, the flavor of the dishes we tried (Burros, Chimichangas and Enchiladas) was unimpressive and this restaurant does not serve any pork dishes! If you like medium-spicy Mexican food, then Poncho's is not for you. The only thing that's acceptable at this place is the ambiance (which is not enough or us to ever make a second visit)."}
{"text":"Alright, it hurts me to do this, but after today, Poncho's is dead to me. I was a faithful customer for years as I grew up in the Laveen area. I returned today, excited for the same quality and feeling a little nostalgic. 

Bleh. It was incredibly loud and every table had a crying baby. Don't get me wrong, I love babies, but every reasonable person has limits. Also, our waitress was awful. I'm not usually too picky, but she didnt once come by after our food was dropped off to ask how everything was. She was morose, made no effort to engage and everything we wanted, we had to chase her down for. 

And we arrive...at the food. The zucchini appetizer is off the menu, big disappointment. My beef tamale was awful. I would have sent it back had my waitress ever returned. My chicken enchilada was edible but tasted like one of those frozen entrees. The salsa is still good, but I'm not about to drive down to south Phoenix if everything else sucks. 

Sorry, Poncho's. You used to be high on my list but you've really lost a lot of flavor and character since my last visit."}
{"text":"Place has really gone down hill. It use to be my favorite.... But service has gone to the dumps!!! Food quality is also bad.. I'll be taking my business to Los Dos... DONT COME HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I can find in the Phoenix valley. It also has a great little neighborhood bar in the back of the restaurant. I tried to stop in here at least once every time I am working out here."}
{"text":"Now for the review. I had the Pollo Fundido which was delicious. However it was truly smothered in the jalapeno and cream cheese mixture as in possibly an 8 ounce brick of it! That said, I would get it again but would ask that they go easy on the cream cheese jalapeno sauce on top.

I agree with the reviewers who said skip the guacamole. They put jalpenos in it which totally overpowers the more subtle flavor of the avocados. They also add sour cream as well. It seemed to be so whipped that there were no chunks of avocado in it whatsoever.

Fantastic waitress and service! So nice and a great job!"}
{"text":"The food is good but if you have children like do, take little as possible inside! I have infant twins with a toddler and Thank God they sat my husband and I with the kiddos of course in a small dining room. It would have been a struggle anywhere else.  The food was good...I had a chimichanga which was decent just not as crisp as it used to be. It was like a wet burrito which are yummy as well."}
{"text":"I go every time I visit Phoenix! Love the Mexican Pizza, the salsa, and the atmosphere. I wish we had food like this in the South."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with food consistency, could update the place after all of these years. Wonderful margaritas and tortillas. I always get the Red Burrito. The bar has always had a nice vibe, never really enjoy any other area."}
{"text":"Just because bill Clinton ate at this restaurant doesn't make it any more of a hole in the wall then it already is. . Nothing special here, I've got to admit there salsa is the bomb as in real good but the food was nothing special, very bland, service was ok. .. if you're ever on the south side of town and you need a bite to eat on your way home hit this place up prices are reasonable here. .oh!  And \"\"\"Bill Clinton ate here\"\"\" as everyone likes to mention . .I guess it's a great selling point for this hole in the wall restaurant. You'll see pictures of him on the wall. .yay! !!"}
{"text":"Very very VERY disappointed with today's food and service, not only did we wait 15 minutes for our server to greet us and take our order, my wife's chicken chimichanga was dry, greasy, and tasteless (not how it used to be) we so happened to over see the bartender while waiting for our server to greet us  stick her finger inside a customers drink take out whatever that was floating and served that same drink to a customer (VERY DISGUSTING AND UNSANITARY).  My wife and I have been coming here for years and really loved the food, but today was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT and we will no longer return to this place or recommend this restaurant to ANYONE!!"}
{"text":"Food sucks, service sucks, and the atmosphere sucks.  Wish yelp allowed negative stars."}
{"text":"I love Poncho's. I grew up in South Phoenix so my family and I came here all the time when I was a kid and I continue to make the drive back here years later and always bring new friends to try the place out. My favorite dish is the Pollo Fundido. It's so good. The salsa in a squeeze bottle is kinda weird, but good. 

Be sure to check out the room with a mural of ex-Pres. Clinton sitting at the end of your table. And the secret service standing on the opposite wall."}
{"text":"I would give them a 5 but it's been a year since I've been there. Ponchos is Mexican Food to me. I compare all other food to Ponchos. I've been there easily a million times. I blame at least 50lb on my body to them. I say that in a good way. Great chips and sauce. I always get the green chili burro enchilada style. They have an awesome bean burrito too. I can review all day. Love you Ponchos. I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I'm not going to spend much time on this review because clearly they have somehow managed to build up a following and they are making the $$. Just to sum it up:
- service was beyond horrible. Managed chaos...screw that, total chaos. We had this tatood waitress who couldn't give a shit. Literally EVERY person in our little room got pissed at her. That takes some serious dedication to be that shitty.
- the food was bland at best. The beans were ok, but the rest...wtf was that shit?
- place smelled funky...like a highly perfumed turd
- too many dumb-ass female managers and waitresses running around doing absolutely nothing. They all worked at one speed. It was like that song Despacito, but instead of wanting to dance, I wanted to throw a cup at their head and tell them to hurry the fuck up.
- parking was good."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday night so it wasn't very full, the AC was up high and the lovely waitress turned it down for me. 
My cousin had the burrito and the rest of us had the chimichangas. 
We had pitchers of margaritas, too. 
I could not move afterwards. I didn't get the full meal with the sides, just the chimichanga and even then we were in such pain because we ate so much, we had to go home. So, it's a lot of food. 
It was really yummy. The margaritas are yummy, too, they do not taste very strong, though. 
Overall, it was a good experience, minus the pain from eating too much afterward. I suggest NOT eating too many of the nachos they bring out beforehand."}
{"text":"The Barracho burrito is incredible and just melts in your mouth. Their salsa is also fantastic. Poncho's never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Good service, good authentic tasting food, good prices and environment. Go check it out!
\"Popular for Bill Clinton's visit\". lol"}
{"text":"Always a good experience! The Pollo Fundido is always great! Sounded kinda weird the first time, but the chorizo cheese crisp is a must! Recommend this place to anyone that like a TRUE authentic Mexican restaurant! 

P.S.
The Albondigas is ALWAYS good on a sick day!"}
{"text":"Service was bad from the beginning. The server gave attitude immediately walking in. Then we were seated. Our waitress was okay at best. Just not very attentive. The food was average.  We ordered a cheese crips and shredded beef tacos. The cheese crisp was pretty good. But not much there. The tacos were dry and flavorless. The guacamole was not fresh. I expected much more."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was a little girl and not much has changed. The food is really good for the price. Sometimes they have their bad days, chips are stale, salsa taste like straight tomato sauce, but overall the food is yummy. 

Some of my favorite dishes include the beef tacos, borracho burro, and the tamale especial. You can't go wrong with those picks. I also have to mention that their michaldas are so good but a bit on the spicy side. 

Fridays and Saturday nights get busy so don't be surprised to wait 15-20 minutes for a seat. Ponchos is on the top of my list for favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Worst take out service ever! I've been picking up food at least once a week from the take out window, lately it seems every time I go there is a mistake with my order, they forget food or give me the wrong order. Yesterday they forgot my abondiga soup, I had to drive all the back to let them know. When I told them they forgot my soup, the server at the window was very rude and questioned if I was telling the truth and not trying to get a free soup out of them. After asking everyone in the kitchen if they remembered packing a soup she finally just threw a soup in a bag and gave it to me. When I get home I picked up the bag and the soup dropped right through the bottom of bag, she didn't secure the lid and it spilled all over the inside of the bag. I called and complained to the manager, she gave no apology, and told me that there is nothing she will do. I told her I'd never go back and she laughed and hung up. They seem to always be rude as it is but this was the last straw. Food is over priced and the restaurant needs remodeling as the carpet smells really bad (what restaurant has carpet anymore?). So long, another long time customer gone! Guess I'll drive to the BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT IN TOWN...Rositas Place on McDowell /24th street!"}
{"text":"I have become pretty obsessed with their veggie burrito! They are generous in the avocado which I like. Friendly service staff inside and I love that you can call in an order and pick up at the window. However the ladies at the window need to be a little faster on helping customers when they see them outside."}
{"text":"Arizona is known for it's amazing foodie gems you can't find anywhere else.

Poncho's is, sadly, not one of them.

Wait! Hear me out. Before you ignore this review, understand that Arizona stands alone when it comes to Mexican food. Having eaten everywhere for Mexican food in both California and New Mexico, I can say that AZ's authenticity and flavor are incomparable. So naturally you would want to make the most of your dining experiences in Arizona and eat at places that have plates that leave a lasting impression on your palette.

Although Poncho's may have a quaint history you want to root for, it doesn't mean that their cooking skills are the kind you want to spend a good amount for. Just because someone says they're Mexican or have a Mexican background does NOT mean that they automatically have the correct method of seasoning, prepping, or even frying.

My boyfriend and I wanted a Sunday lunch there, and we were going in with an open mind. I was actually excited that I would finally try the \"pollo fundido\" that everyone talked about. We left a little disappointed.

The human traffic in the dining area is distracting. The setup of tables is a little weird, and although the warm paintings of desert landscape are inviting, the constant movement of waitresses, busboys, and families is...well, annoying. Then the food came. It was very, very, VERY inauthentic. The salsa for the chips was literally a tomato paste that resembled something like ketchup with some spices thrown into it. The meal was heavy; it was greasy and felt more like a fast food combo that wouldn't keep me full for too long. Great meals leave you satisfied, but here I couldn't eat much. I looked around and noticed that the crowd that ate at this place really didn't care if the food was bland or nothing close to the beautiful mom and pop shops that would put the food to shame. It was saddening and a little frustrating to know that they were missing out. 

\"Can I be honest with you?\" My boyfriend asked. 
\"I could get something just like this at Del Taco.\"

Mr. Clinton, if you come back to Phoenix, I can show you places that would blow your mind."}
{"text":"Time for an update. We've been to Poncho's about five times now. The only disappointment was when we did the take-out window: got several tacos that were way over cooked. 

Tonight we arrived at 6:10 PM on a Wednesday. They had four parties in line, as usual. We waited 12 mins. 

My wife ordered #18 which was two Shredded Beef Tacos, beans and rice. I ordered #11, a Relleno, Green Chili Corn Tamale and a Cheese Enchilada. We added two margaritas for a $30 tab before tip. 

The #18 was very good. The beef had good flavor. The rice and beans: outstanding. I don't know if it's all scratch made but it sure tasted like it was. My #11 was very good. I love onions and the sauce was very heavy with onions. The Tamale was savory and huge. The enchilada was small but I still couldn't finish it. I haven't had a lot of rellenos so I'm not sure how it compared to others. 

Our server was attentive on a busy night, so ole there!

Still highly recommended."}
{"text":"This has been my families go to restaurant for over 30 years. I love so so so much love it. Everything  is amazing drinks & food.  We come from South Chandler and it's worth the drive.  The prices are unbeatable."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous, service is no good, food is not authentic, the price was outrageous just not a good experience at all i will not be going back..."}
{"text":"When President Clinton visited town he made a stop at Poncho's Mexican Food.  It struck me as an odd choice at the time, but also made me curious about the food.  Was Clinton just making a political stop or did he actually have some inside intelligence from forward operatives?

After eating at Poncho's, it was obvious that Bill knew a thing or two about Mexican food.  They have wonderful combinations and the restaurant has become a habit for our family.  

PLEASE don't confuse this wonderful independent restaurant with the Pancho's Buffet restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 40 years. The food has remained close to the same though it's not prepared with quite The same care as it was years ago. I particularly like the number 11, their green sauce is great. But it's just added to a plate and stuck in an oven and quite often the cheese inside isn't even melted all the way through. Your green corn tamale used to have either better ingredients or something, your corn is in Sweden anymore it's just not the same. It's just not the same. But it's still very good and I still keep coming back love the chips and sauce."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since I was a kid.. Overall it is a good place to go when you want amazing addictive salsa!! I always come back for more and can always rely on a good meal when coming here."}
{"text":"This is Chicano style food, not truly authentic Mexican food. Everything has a bunch of cheese & sour cream and not spicy. Beans have a lot to say about a Mexican restaurant & they're alright."}
{"text":"Eww hate everything about this place waiters are rude they look as if they just slapped the food on the plate and had to constantly ask for refills will not recommend this place at all!!!"}
{"text":"Just okay...now.

Ponchos used to be so much better than my experience today. This was actually my first time dining inside the restaurant instead of take-out. It was no doubt really cool to see the presidential room dedicated to Bill Clinton, but the food today in no way represented that prestige.

As usual with any Mexican restaurant, we got chips and salsa.Unfortunately, the salsa lacked the flavor that I remembered it having. For lunch, I got the Borracho Burro and got to try a tamale and chicken enchilada. The enchilada was okay, but the tamale flat out sucked today. It was pretty flavorless and didn't feel like it was made with any heart. My burrito was alright, but it didn't have any umph to it flavor wise... I could order the same thing at a lot of different restaurants in the valley...it was mediocre.

Today was a sad day because my visit today made it just that much harder to drive out to South Phoenix to dine here. It's not just the distance anymore, but it's due to a lack of desire for Poncho's renowned dishes. 

I hope whatever happened here turns around, but I'm not the only one who feels this way, and that's a shame."}
{"text":"I really have to say that my experience was just okay.  I walked in the wrong way and got ovewhelmed.  There are 2 doors, one is for the bar and one for the restaurant.  Because it was so crowded everywhere we couldn't figure out what door we needed to enter.  We finally got inside and seated in the presidential room.    The doorways and rooms are so tight and clausterphobic.  Everytime I needed something I would have to flag down the waitress and I felt like we were bugging her.  The food was just okay.  I ordered the veggie burrito that I liked but would just get it from the take out window next time where it is even cheaper than inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service been here 5-7 x and service hasn't been this bad it's not the greatest but today 8/14/2016 was beyond the most horrible service we got. Took her almost 15 mins to \"greet\" if that's what you call it because there really was no greet said what do you want. My fiancé ask what the Spanish steak was and she literally said \" nothing special just a peace of steak\" wow so shocked. Then she brings our drinks drops them off at the other end of the table so that WE have to grab them. Food is good that's all your getting here one of the worse customer service restaurants I've been too. This WILL be the last time I come here"}
{"text":"Ponchos ... what can I say, other than no matter how many times I have given you the chance to redeem yourself on food and service, you just always score an F. Well, okay, your bar is a site to behold and entertaining. Do I mean that in a good way? Well, if you like electronic juke box music you pay for to listen to while games are on various televisions and the crowd of 30 , or 60 or maybe the random drunk 25 year old hits on the said 55 year old in the dim lit area of loud ... sure! It's entertaining to watch ... while dining. #entersarcasm 
I've not been woo'd by the customer service skills here ... ever. I have been here about half a dozen times now. The 'holding area' while you wait for a table is tight.. very tight. The hostesses are busy beyond words and barely greet you. We usually go to the entertaining bar, while we wait for a table. I told you, it's entertaining!! The one thing I do like here: the margaritas are good and they are strong. I pray the glasses are clean. I'm not sure. I just cross myself and pray, every time. 
We recently ordered take out. Why? I am not sure. My husband was out and near Poncho's. He asked that I call the order in as he was leaving his venue. I tried. I was on hold for 5 minutes , the girl came on the line asking me to hold again. Okay , I said. Next, another 8 minutes. She came on again asking me to hold and I told her , 'I've been on hold for over 13 minutes now, can you just take my order?' She said , 'Please hold!' That was it. My husband beat me to this place. Insane. He said the place was nuts and one girl was running the 'take out area'. He got our food home. It was anything but appealing. It was disgusting and so incredibly greasy, I found it inedible. I thought the chips tasted like a fishy taste , which , in my opinion, meant they were cooked in old oil.. so I toasted them a few minutes. The salsa was watery. At least when you eat on property, the chips are seemingly fresh and so is the salsa. Our  meals : Enchiladas and chicken tacos , were literally swimming in oil. I refused to eat mine. Did I end up with a tummy ache later? Yes. Why, Kimberly, Why?!!! It tasted bad and it looked bad and you ate it?! Maybe I've finally learned this time! 
I've eaten all over the valley and there are legitimately good Mexican food places here! THIS is not one of them ! Do I care the at ONCE upon a time President Clinton ate here? No. That was then and this is now. Maybe he didn't know truly good Mexican food and I'm sure they turned off that crazy electronic juke box that day and didn't have their rudest , curt staff waiting on him. The end , Ponchos. You are a big ball of yuck. Save yourself and if you want this level of Mexican food, go thru the drive thru at your neighborhood Bertos, those sometimes are actually good! And minus the jukebox!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family since I was a kid. Unfortunately, it seems as though the taste of the food has gone bad, new cooks perhaps?  Although there are many that still choose to eat here, I will no longer return especially after receiving poor customer service."}
{"text":"Place is pretty good, small Beer selection for having a large Bar. I have one special request Poncho, Modelo Especial!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since before I was born, the service has changed somewhat over the years but I am always happy that the food quality has stayed the same."}
{"text":"Had to seat ourselves but overall a great experience and the food was fantastic. I will definitely come back. Barbara was our serve. She does a great job!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! I get something different every time and it's always delicious! On the lighter side, their marinaded grilled chicken with rice and beans was so simple but just as delicious and satisfying as when I ordered a chimichanga. I love their margaritas too! This place can do no wrong."}
{"text":"I've lived in this side of town my whole life and I would always see this place booming with business so I decided to give it a try. Omg j have no idea what people see in this place. The food was not good at all I found myself having to middy it with salt, pepper, lemon, and hot sauce to to even enjoy it a bit. Now not only does their food suck but this location is so dark and crowded it's very much outdated and everything looks really dirty this is a huge red flag. Onside ring you eat/pay there. I will never go back and I hope I saved some of you guys a trip there."}
{"text":"PONCHOS IS BY FAR #1
(Not to be confused with the dingy Panchos Buffet.)  

This place in located in South Phoenix and is only about a 10 min drive away from the airport.. Makes it convenient for people who are traveling into or out of Phoenix and have that itch for real Mexican food. This place is always packed. The food is served piping hot, with great chili sauces and unlimited hot chips and salsa and is super affordable to boot! I recommend the Pollo Fundito - Marinated pulled chicken chimichanga that has a warm jalapeno cream cheese inside.. Not good for you, but tastes oh so good.. This place has great music, fantastic margaritas, and friendly service..  The one thing I do not like about this place is their Guacamole. It is unimpressive so don't waste your time adding that to any of your dishes. Lucky for us that we don't need the guac to make this place rock!  Side note... Bill Clinton dines here when he visits the grand canyon state.. They painted his picture on the wall where he usually sits. I'm a Republican and I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty Decent food at good prices. My favorite is the Pollo Fundido. Seeing the photo of the cheese crisp here on Yelp, I'm definitely ordering that next trip.
The staff is very friendly and service is good.
It used to be a sign of a good restaurant if they brought water to your table before you ordered. Ponchos brings you water, chips and salsa.
Even before I lived close to Ponchos it was one of my favorites.

* I advise taking a table in the bar or else you might get stuck next to a very noisy kitchen or the bathrooms."}
{"text":"After having multiple people telling me this is the best mexican food around, I figured I had to try this place. I was no where near impressed.  The only upside was the salsa and chips, hot and fresh and the salsa had zip but a great flavor. I got the sampler meal and it was subpar.  I can think of multiple places better than this for Mexican food. Ohh well atleast I can say I tried it."}
{"text":"Wow this place was packed for a Thursday night. With a half an hour wait I was expecting great things. Everything was just average. The chips were greasy and the salsa wasn't anything to write home about. The pricing is very reasonable. The Carne Asada was thick but very chewy, not the best piece of meat. The frozen margarita was very good and I had a bite of someone's tamale and tostada and those were both very good. The ambiance is more of what people go for I think. The interior is very cozy and welcoming like someone's home."}
{"text":"The food here isn't bad,  and the service is always friendly - yeah, you're going to wait a while if they're busy but that's OK,  good things take time right? 

Here's why it's only 3 stars from me:  it's just \"OK\".     A big serving and a lot of rich ingredients is good and all,  but basically it doesn't matter what you order,  everything here tastes about the same as everything else,   and while I wouldn't use the word \"bland\" to describe it,  it's also not exciting and there aren't any unique stand-outs.         So why do I keep going back?     It's near home and it's safe to take any picky eater here."}
{"text":"It's my first time being here and already I feel the great energy from the staff. Everyone has a smile and very accommodating. You definitely feel the teamwork between them all. I had the cheese enchiladas and they were really good. The red sauce taste authentic. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Poncheros never lets us down. We regularly come to this location and the staff is always so friendly and the food is always guaranteed delicious!!"}
{"text":"So... Do NOT go with a big group on a Friday night at 7pm.  It was an hour and a half wait.  But what do you expect on a Friday night with 16 people.  Yea... we weren't exactly on our A-Game... we should have split up into groups of 4 and probably got sat a lot quicker.

As it turned out... most of our group left and by the time they had a table for us... we were down to 5.  Of course, we had been at the bar drinking margaritas and beers and eating chips and salsa.... so we weren't terribly starved when we sat down.

The margaritas are very tasty... however, was a bit bummed that the Cadillac margarita was not served with the Grand Marnier on the side.  Oh well.

The chips and salsa were Right On!  Nice and crispy chips and the salsa had a bit of nice heat and flavor different from most salsas.  It wasn't your typical pico chopped salsa... this was smooth and liquidy... but don't let that influence you til you taste it.  

Once we got around to dinner.... i had the albondigas soup... it wasn't very \"soupy\".  It had lots of rice and like 6 medium sized meatballs... I thought it was filling and tasty.  The soup part wasn't just broth... it had a nice light beefy-tomato-y broth to it.

I also helped the hubby eat some of his Muchacho Grande Burrito.  You had better be hungry when you order that.... it's freakin' huge.  There's red and green chili as well as chorizo in it.

The one knock I have on this place is the guacamole.... it's not real.  I ordered it as a side and it came out as guacamole cream.  I'm something of a guacamole snob.... i like my guac fresh with chunks of avocados.  

A friend ordered the pollo fundido and it too was Huge!  and the Jalapeno cream sauce it came with was off the hook.  We dipped everything in it.  :)

This is a very local type joint.... love the local, family atmosphere.  The servers and folks here work hard and do the best they can to accommodate as many people as possible as quickly as possible.  It's not a huge place so expect a wait on the weekends because this is a local favorite.  :)"}
{"text":"The ponchos pizza with the green chile is always worth the drive !! There have been many times all we go for is that ponchos pizza , love the chips and salsa too ! So great we live right up the street .."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and our friends who live in town often go there.  It was super busy and we had to wait 20 minutes for a table on a Thursday night, chips were greasy, in fact all the food was extra oily, flavors ordinary, services extra spotty as our very polite very overwhelmed waiter (with only 2 days experience) struggled to bring out food that took a long time to come and in fact one of us had not received her food and 3 of us were done.  I don't think they'll be back soon and we won't ask to go there....to bad, we were in the \"Clinton Ate Here Room\""}
{"text":"Love the greasy chips! and salsa. Shredded beef tacos are my fav. Rice is good. Price is right. Too bad this place is too far from home or I would it here more often."}
{"text":"A very good restaurant. Good hot sauce, Good chips, Excellent machaca tacos. Very good red chili burros. Cheese enchiladas are a little inconsistent, usually not cooked all the way but very good when they are.

Can be very busy at times.

One note for this and other Mexican restaurants. Why are people charged more when you order something without rice and beans? Most of the time the amount of food minus the rice and beans is way more than enough. I can't tell you how many times I see plates with rice and beans left on them. They just get thrown away."}
{"text":"Sunday, and the family wants to go on a picnic. Great.
You have a couple of choices.

Feign some sort of non-specific illness so you can sit home and watch Red Zone Channel, or tag along and act like a good parent for a change.
You choose the latter.

This was the drill.

I called in a takeout order at Poncho's, picked it up, then drove the entire crew up to Dobbin's Lookout atop South Mountain. (About a 10 minute drive from Poncho's on Central Avenue)

Yup.
A seven-mile vertical drive up South Mountain chocked with enough mountain switchbacks to ensure your entire family will be car sick upon arrival, leaving most, if not all of Poncho's feast available for your lunch tomorrow.

Hey, I didn't do this on purpose, things just worked-out in my favor for a change."}
{"text":"OK food but horrible service. 

Order over the phone was told that it would take about 10-15 minutes. Arrived in about 30 minutes to give them time to make our office order. The cashier went from 2 lines to one and there was no one informing people in line what was happening. Once we got the food back to office, it seem that it was not even our order as many items were different from what we had called in. First time and last time we will use this place for our Friday office lunch. 

The poor pregnant lady working behind the counter was doing her best with out any help. The people that were there that had ordered were still waiting after we had left 30 minutes later after arriving at the location. 

I do not recommend this place for orders that are for multiple parties or at busy times that means 11-2pm. Even walking in to order may provide one with a lifetime of frustration for ok food. Save your sanity and time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Phoenix! Pollo fundido is the best burrito with jalapeño cream cheese sauce."}
{"text":"Was So Good, We Ate To Much.

Every now and then I find myself at Ponchos Mexican Food to satisfy my  burrito cravings.  The only problem I encounter when I go to Ponchos is the food is so good I eat too much.

On this visit my lunch companions and I  started with the nachos and chipotle chicken.  The nachos were delicious  and we could have stopped there, but we didn't and ordered our entrée's. 

 My lunch companions ordered the Carne Asada Burrito, Carnitas Fritas, El Crudo Burro, and I had the Pollo Fundido.  The Pollo Fundido, was a wonderfully flavored, deep fried Chimichunga, with Jalapeno Cream Cheese on top. The chicken was tender and moist, the tortilla was crisp, and the Fundido sauce was perfect.

My lunch companion said his El Crudo Burro was delicious as well.  The machaca beef was lean, tender, combined with a light tomatillo sauce. The burrito is topped with red enchilada sauce and melted cheese, and  served with rice.  I think on my next visit I will have to give it a try.

The service at Pancho's is always great. Our drinks were always refilled and we were offered a take out drink as we left. 

If you're ever in the area and craving good Mexican Food give Pancho's a try."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in south Phoenix ! The chimichangas are the best ! Been coming here since I can remember ! Stop In and try some awesome Mexican dining."}
{"text":"Good food. Reasonable prices. I had the chimichanga platter with beef, rice and beans. The quantity and quality of food was excellent. Our server was quick and attentive. 
Issues I found were the long wait time and the crowded entry space with people waiting for a table."}
{"text":"My family's favorite local Mexican food restaurant. The best albondigas soup I've ever had, plus they have huge Ponchos Mexican pizza---a giant cheese crisp covered in green chile meat, fresh tomatoes, and fresh diced green onions. Great margaritas, too!"}
{"text":"THE best place to get green chile and pollo fundido(chicken chimichanga topped with spicy cream sauce). The best place to get a frozen strawberry daquiry and frozen margaritas. Only reason why I took away one star is because unless you get there shortly after they open you will more than likely encounter a loooong wait time. A small hallway is the only place you can wait to be called and it smells kind of stuffy in there. Bar area is a great idea with a jukebox and two tvs but the environment can get kind of loud and ghetto. There was one time where we were caught in between a bar fight so we've strayed away from being seated at the bar."}
{"text":"Been there many times throughout the years.  It is always busy, but, worth the wait,  The Pollo Fundido is excellent.  Sometimes herd to find a parking spot."}
{"text":"It was so amazing the first time we went that all we did was talk about it and tell everyone we knew to go check it out. Thought we had found the next best Mexican food restaurant in the valley next to Jalapeño Inferno in Scottsdale. We came back and we're expecting the same experience and sadly we were let down. Chips were cold and stale, salsa wasn't good and we paid to have a the chunky salsa and that was a let down as well. Our food arrived and first bite I find myself gagging on a 12\" long thick stand of hair that was inside my fundido chimichanga. The waitress came by about 5 mins after this happened and sent the food back to be remade. By the time the food was back out the rest of the table was finished with their food and ready to leave. I was so grossed out I couldn't even eat my food. I left hungry and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 10 years now and can say without a doubt that this is the best Mexican food on this earth.  If you want the world's best bean burrito then look no further.  I hope ponchos lives on forever because I am now dependent on ponchos bean burrito for my very survival."}
{"text":"Okay listen I'm updating my review and it is with sadness that I report that I will never come here again. The quality of service is just so absolutely terrible. The food is nothing short of fantastic, if you ever receive it. They are painfully understaffed 365 days per year and completely unapologetic about it. The fact that any restaurant thinks that it is okay to never refill drinks, get every order wrong, make you wait 45 minutes to get your check, ask for go boxes but never receive them, is just criminal.  I hate that this place makes me so mad because it has such potential. Goodbye old friend."}
{"text":"Back in the day I used to drive all the way from Surprise to eat here, yes the food was that good. They used to have the most killer Pollo Fundido as well as amazing chunky salsa. 

Time has certainly changed this place.. we started with a cheese crisp with green chiles, delicious.. nice and crispy with just the right amount of chile strips.. also ordered their killer chunky salsa which was as good as I remember it. 

Then come my Pollo Fundido swimming, Im serious about this, swimming in a pool of grease!! They didn't even bother draining the thing before tossing it onto my plate. Was disgusting too, not even like clear oil but dark brown grease. Vile. Then the Misters Sampler showed up.. this thing was a fucking mess! You couldn't tell what was what under the piles of sauce and lettuce until you took a bite. Mini chimis were burnt, mini tacos burnt, tamales, cold and hard.. was a complete wreck. 

After a few bites we called it.. major loss of appetite.. a shame too cause the salsa was actually really good but the entrees were inedible. 

Meanwhile, the Mister was attached to the toilet within a few hours of eating here.. he was sick all day the next too.. so word of caution, eat here at your own risk.

Im sure going to miss the good meals I used to have here, what a real shame."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. Although I haven't really tried anything besides the Pollo Fundido (Fried chimichanga filled with shredded chicken and topped off with a jalapeno cream sauce.) Amazing!! My husband had tried a lot of other things in the menu, but always goes back to the Pollo Fundido. 

The service is not the best since they're almost always packed inside. You will probably only see your server an average of three time like mentioned in another review. The space is very limited it used to be a regular home which was converted into a restaurant.  You sit very close to the other table little space to move around. If you can ask to be seated in the first dining room area. The rooms in the back of the restaurant get very hot and uncomfortable.  They also have a bar if you like to eat around loud music."}
{"text":"For the non-Mexican food lover, you'll find their hamburgers to be adequately sufficient. It's just a Plain Jane type of burger, lettuce and tomatoes. A simple man. Yet, good and filling, it's a burger at a Mexican place. Nachos would be a second choice, but they're really just mini, greasy, delicious  tostadas. I love them! Order the Small - you're not going to be able to finish it, so don't bother ordering the Large. Oooh, almost forgot about a picky kid's choice: a giant cheese crisp! This can also be an appetizer for a large group, just add salsa zigzags all over that biznatch. 

Slightly Mexican inclinations? Their lovely,  giant chimichanga is what I set my standards to. It's delicious. 

Margaritas are strong and the staff are friendly. Salsa is super spicy and chips crisp.  Grew up here and when I visit Arizona, Poncho's is always a must."}
{"text":"At Poncho's you will find good Mexican food, but there is always a weird musty smell that I can't get over.  If you do go, I reccomend the frozen margaritas.  They are poured straight out of a machine, but they are delicious."}
{"text":"My go-to place when I want Mexican.  Pollo Fundido  is excellent, Chili Relleno is my go-to comfort food.  We always feel welcome.  It can feel close, but the place was a house at one time."}
{"text":"Went to Poncho's on a football  Sunday and sat in the lounge. We had the chorizo cheese crisp, which was really good. And for entrees we had the Muchacho Grande and the Pollo Fundido. As good as they both were, we liked the Pollo Fundido a lot more. Maragaritas were decent. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"First off, what the heck kind of place charges their customers $1.00 for the \"good\" salsa to go with your chips, puts them in a soup cup (not bowl) and no free refills? The free salsa tasted more like ketchup than hot sauce. To top that off, why would any mexican food restaurant offer you EITHER beans OR rice with your meal, not both?!?!? And then when you ask for both you get charged extra without them telling you!?!? WTF!?!?!? Food wasn't even that great. 
I don't know why we came back. Service was not the greatest. Felt bad for the party next to us cause they got seated right before us and we got our food before she even asked if they were ready to order. Manager was chatting it up with another table and one of the bus boys came by and she said something to him and once he was out of the room started talking crap about him to the customers. Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"I've been a patron of this establishment since I was a young child. When I thought of authentic Mexican food, I immediately think of Poncho's. It has been a many years since the last time I've eaten there and had a hankering for some good Mexican food. However, I was deeply disappointed in what I experienced. I ordered the Tamale Especiale with the  jalepeno cream cheese sauce. I know the sauce is the same from the Pollo Fundido (my favorite), but it tasted nothing like it. I tasted no cream cheese. It tasted like sour cream with chunks of jalepeno. Even the jalepeno didn't taste like jalepeno! The chicken was flavorless. I couldn't tell there was chicken in it. My mother ordered a beef chimichunga with red sauce. She complained that it was also had no flavor and got sick afterward. I hope this is a one time occurrence because through the many years of eating there I've never had a bad meal...never!"}
{"text":"Had the Pancho Villa burrito and ate it in the El presidente room...If this place is good for the one and only Slick Willy Clinton its good enough for me..Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"I went with a newborn son and it was way too crowded for a car seat to steer around the restaurants weird floor plans but food was delicious. Definitely would go again however server was a bit distracted and would often forget about us."}
{"text":"My first time here and I left never wanting to come back again. Our server was nice but it seemed like she had no idea what she was doing. Maybe she was new but non the less anytime we asked her a question about the menu or drinks she had to go ask someone else. She didn't even bring out silverware for us when she brought out our food and we were always waiting on drink refills. It took forever to get drinks and order the food. I was starving by the time we ordered and i ordered the taquitos with bean and rice. The shell of the taquitos were over fried and  when you bit into the food it tasted like stale chips. My other friends got tacos and they said the same thing about the taco shells. On top of all that the credit machine was down when we were trying to pay . She came back and asked if we had cash and when we told her we didn't, she kept saying well we can only take cash so I don't know. We asked her if she could take our card numbers down and charge it when the machine was working again but she said we couldn't. She said they were trying to fix it so we waited another hour and half and by that time I was pissed. She didn't come back to see if there was anything they could do while we waited and kinda just forgot about us. After all the waiting she comes back with the credit card number on the receipt and told us to put the phone number on the back and they will call us when they are going to charge the card. Service sucked and food sucked"}
{"text":"I have been going to Ponchos for at least twenty years and I am always satisfied.  The food is heavy - the way Mexican food should be.  You cannot go wrong with the chimichangas, Mexican pizza, green chili or flautas.  

A few years ago during a trip to Phoenix, President Clinton came into Ponchos.  They commemorated the event with a mural on the wall where Clinton sat.  Also the chips and salsa are bottomless and fantastic!"}
{"text":"My wife is a die hard but that's because she grew up eating here. I can say this is not a bad place for food. They make a good everything. 

We had 
2x 3 way burrito green chili, red chili and bean with green sauce on top. 
1x Pollo fundito with rice (excellent)
A ton of chips and salsa 
The bill was slightly over $20...lol freaking MCD'S is more."}
{"text":"A very authentic Mexican Food spot on south side of Phoenix. The style of the restaurant is very colorful and festive. Every time I have been there it is busy especially on the weekends breakfast thru lunch times. Had the green burro with rice and beans and it tasted like my own nana made it. Would definitely go back and enjoy other dishes."}
{"text":"Love the food here! They serve you so much food for the price. The reason I give 4 instead of 5 is that it's always so full and doesn't do reservations so there's always a wait time. It's also a very small space, it's very cramped and can feel hot inside. If you don't mind the wait and space it's definitely worth it. Just don't go super hungry that you can't wait."}
{"text":"LOVE the Nachos with sour cream on the side, as well as the chips, salsa and Margaritas.  My old \"go-to\" menu item was the Pollo Fundido before I changed my eating habits :)  My recommendation is to go at happy hour and sit in the bar area!"}
{"text":"Ponchos has the best pollo fundido in town. not to mention the Mexican pizza with red or green Chile is fire!!!!! And if you try the child's & salsa you'll want to slap yo lady!!! Lol...(bomb)"}
{"text":"Interior was cute and design was nice . Got a poncho vila- not a big fan of it but overall great experience ."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a kid in the 90's. Food is still great but service is crap. All young kids waitering and it takes 20 minutes to get a beverage yet alone some silverware."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best shredded beef taco I've had in Phoenix.  Fun atmosphere, affordable and casual.  It appears to be a busy joint so I'd expect a little wait for a table unless you're ok with bellying up to the bar.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Rude Hostess. She didn't receive me and my party with a smile at all nor made eye contact with me."}
{"text":"Worst \"Mexican\" food ever
Do not waste your time or money here
Everything's canned and the employees need training on customer service skills. 
This is a great place to throw a few back and eat once you get the munchies.

My family ordered despite how unwelcoming the employees were and upon getting our food we were GREATLY disappointed with everything it's the worst appearance and taste."}
{"text":"Their 3 way chimichangas are to die for. I was talking to a friend about mexican food. I said there is only one mexican food restaurant that I will eat at. Their food is authentic. He said let's try it and it better be good. We get there for lunch and is full as usual. We ordered 2 3 way chimichangas to go. He sat in his car and said let me try it before we leave. He tasted it and he said wow this is pretty good. I live like 10 min away. He kept it on his lap and could not stop eating it at stop lights. By the time we got to my house his plate was gone. I have been going to Ponchos for a couple of decades and that is the only mexican restaurant I will eat at. I normally go out to eat alot of italian and sushi but Ponchos will always draw me back. You have to try their 3 way chimichangas when you go there."}
{"text":"Ponchos is the best! My family has been going to Ponchos since the 80's and can't get enough. If you want true Arizona style Mexican food, this is the place. The chili relleno is awesome, the chimi's are also very good. It's loud and very informal, but always a great time!"}
{"text":"Had takeout from here...the food was hot and worth the wait! The tamales were really good! I plan on going back! They have amazing salsa and great service in their Togo area. I haven't eaten inside yet but I plan on it! Great food!"}

{"text":"Been coming here since 94' and still.  I like sitting at the bar are, play good music and good clientele.   And ofcourse you'll run into some high school friends! Lol"}
{"text":"There lines out the door says it all good mixture of great Mexican food lots of good salsa and chips we have plenty on the menu and they like to keep it a small family owned business it's a great place to get a authentic food if you're in the area"}
{"text":"The food was not bad, but the restaurant was filthy! The service was horrible, when we asked for our server they got highly irate. Worst restaurant experience I have had in years, I would not recommend this restaurant no to anyone."}
{"text":"I would always go into the restaurant with the best experience and so loved by the employees, but this time it was the most worst experience with service I had possible gotten. Never got forks, literally asked for water 10 times, and on top of the the waitress was arguing with a family sitting behind us that had the most simplest request. Made me not want to eat there again that's how bad it was. Hopefully they get rid of the waitress..."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. Service was terrible. You are seated at awarkard tables with other diners only having you eating as the view. Our waitress was less than impressive. Walked over said you ready to order?! What do you want to drink?! I'll be back to take your order. Almost 10 minutes later (literally) she brought our drinks then seemed shocked when we started our order and said I'll be right back. After returning she took our order one item was the chicken avocado salad - she asked what kind of dressing? I asked for the options and the were all awful. Ranch 1000 island and creamy Italian? For a Mexican salad sure sounds great. We also ordered fajitas when the arrived we expected a sizzling platter of smoky grilled veggies and steak. We got a plate full of liquid several strips of semi but meat raw onions semi cooked bell peppers and a tomato slice. The guacamole looked like brownish grey goop. Disgusting. We told the waitress when she dropped off the plate ideas not fajitas and she just said ok here's your tacos and walked away. Never to her from her again till our check arrived. We asked to speak with a manager who looked at the fajitas and said oh it looks more like teriyaki beef...wth! We had them removed fomrom our bill but the overall service, food and attitudes are plenty to keep us away."}
{"text":"AMAZING mexican food!  i am no fan whatsoever of mexican food...BUT i AM a major fan of Don Poncho's mexican food...specifically their carnitas and asada tacos and sopes...i can only speak for these two items.  And i will keep on coming back for them!  delicious!"}
{"text":"I made a wrong turn to avoid an accident scene on Baseline Road...GOOD THING! I found Panchos!  This place is super cheap and super delicious!  I usually order the El Crudo burrito ($6.45 only!) and I love the Mole sauce!  The burrito is stuffed with Machacha beef and comes with rice and some lettuce...the sauce is the best Mole sauce I have ever had.  

I have never had to wait for my food. Although the parking lot can get packed. This place is amazing. if I'm ever in phoenix again on business I'm going here!  

Love it. 

btw, I was on  mission to find some bomb ass Mexican food and was somewhat disappointed. People kept referring me to Filbertos.  WTF Go to PANCHOS!"}
{"text":"Not what you would expect this neighborhood.
Not really bad, but uninspired. Service was ok.
Will try one more time because it is convenient."}
{"text":"Came here with friends and family for a birthday party on Sunday and really liked it! This is my third time here and it just gets better and better each time. I wish that I was a little bit more hungry as I just ended up getting the albondigas soup. The soup was good and came with a side of lemons and tortillas, but I wish that they gave you a little bit more as it just came with three meatballs and a little bit of rice. It was not the best albondigas I ever had, but it was good. I ended up adding some of their amazing guacamole, sour cream, and salsa to the soup to make the soup a little bit thicker. Unfortunately the soup was a little thin and greasy, but again once you add some sides it makes up for the lack of thinness. 

Our waitress was very nice and attentive to our needs. Our salsa, chips, and water were constantly refilled and I felt appreciated that I was there. Speaking of the salsa I loved the house salsa that came with our chips. It was full of flavor and had just enough heat to open up my senses. One of my friends ordered their chunky salsa, which costs $1, and you could see the chunks of tomato and peppers--very good, but sucks that you have to spend $1 for a small cup.

I checked out my friends food, which was a mix of tacos, chimichangas, burritos, refried beans, and taco salads--all which I sampled and were great. I just think next time I will come with a bigger appetite and try one of those entrees. I would come at a different time as the wait was a little long, but worth it. I will be back when I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Been going here since I was a little girl. Always always good. Get the albondigas soup!"}
{"text":"Simply the worst dining experience I've had. From the moment I walked in the experience was just AWFUL. The hostess was rude and not welcoming whatsoever, an older lady that was waiting to be seated even made a remark to her about her rudeness, so I know it wasn't just me that noticed it. We asked to be seated in their \"lounge\" area as we were planning to have a couple of drinks. Once sat, one waitress came by to take our drink order(mind you we hadn't received drink menus) so we began asking about their drinks and pricing. Her response was that she didn't know, so I asked for a drink menu, she came by, dropped it off and disappeared. About 10 minutes later another waitress came by to take our drink order I inquired about a beer, which was not on the drink menu provided to us, and again the response was that she didn't know. She finally came back after she checked and we placed our drink order. We waited over 20 minutes for two simple drinks, a michelada and a Budweiser in the bottle. Unless they're brewing the beer in the back, I really don't think it should take that long for two beer drinks. But since we were sitting in the bar area, we could see what was taking so long. Clearly this place is a place of \"usuals\", because two ladies were getting in an altercation and other patrons from all over the bar area knew them by name and the staff caters directly to their usuals. One usual walked in and not even 2 minutes later, her margarita was ready for her at the bar... But I waited over 20 minutes for a simple beer and some tomato juice, that was not tasty at all. When we finally asked if we could order food, the waitress off the bat handed us \"to-go\"
Boxes which was really confusing since we hadn't even placed our order. Sounds welcoming, right? When we finally got our food, it was sub-par, the usual Americanized Mexican food, nothing spectacular as people had raved to me about. About 15 minutes into our meal, the check was dropped off. We weren't asked if we wanted another drink, nothing. We felt we were being rushed out of the establishment. My friend who I was with was not happy and asked when she came by if we couldn't stay to have another drink(hypothetically, because we didn't really want to stay somewhere where we felt unwanted) because it felt like she wanted us out. Her response was that we could stay as long as we needed she had just dropped off the check for when we were ready... But we looked around, and noticed that no other tables around us had checks dropped off, some who had been there longer than us, again the \"usuals\". 
I've seen another review regarding they felt their service was poor due to their race, and my friend who I was with felt exactly the same way. I don't like to make everything about race, but sometimes, it's hard not to.  
All-in-all, it was a disappointing experience. I moved here over 10 years ago and always heard about this place, and when I finally had the chance to go, I was excited, but wasn't expecting this experience. I am a self-proclaimed foodie and a localist and this is a local establishment I will not  support again."}
{"text":"Authentic mexican food.  This is a long time family spot and I continue to go there whenever I feel like I need a great taco, rice and beans.  Never had a bad service in almost two decades of going there.  Could not recommend enough."}
{"text":"We live in the area and have gone here for years. Last night we were treated so badly the minute we walked in the door that I would say that we will never be back and will let others know the way we were treated. It was an awful experience to say the least."}

{"text":"I ordered a pollo fundido and hubby had the carne asada special. Food was really good, definitely recommend trying this pkace out if you're ever on the south side."}
{"text":"I ate there yesterday because of this post. The food was not edible. I ordered the Pollo Fundido and Dos Enchiladas with shredded beef. The Pollo Fundido has a terrible taste from the chimichanga being fried in very dirty oil. I could not get past the flavor to take more than 2 bites. The enchilada sauce had a very strong one note flavor - can't name what flavor it was other than bad. The shredded beef had no seasoning. It taste like they cooked beef in water then shredded it apart. Do not eat here, it's a waste of money!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat good mexican food. We eat at this place almost once a week. The service is excellent, there's not much of a wait time. Definitely a place to to eat good mexican food."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I really did not enjoy my time at poncho's like my friend described to me. We were visiting Phoenix for a conference so my friend who is from Arizona mentioned Poncho's to me as one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix because President Clinton specifically stopped by for authentic Mexican food. The story sounded very promising so we decided to try it out. 

The place was fairly crowded with a line about 30 minutes wait time. You could tell that the place has some history because the decorations are pretty old. Since there was a line, we felt pretty good about it just like my friend said. However, we started to feel differently as the waitress took us to our table through the restaurant. There was a very distinct smell around our table in the room. We couldn't tell whether it was the smell from the kitchen which was next to our table or the smell of old carpet that have been soaked with years of Mexican food. Regardless, what the smell was, it wasn't pleasant so here was the first impression. The menu provided some traditional Mexican food items, which were fairly authentic. However, the chips and salsa were underwhelming at the best. My main dish was again disappointing to the point that I didn't even remember what I ate. This was definitely one of most disappointing meals that I had for a long time. Personally, I will not recommend Poncho's to anyone and will not return to this place again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times with the hopes I get something I like the next time I return considering the reviews. I still don't. The food is bland and greasy. Not very authentic IMO. They do give you a big portion for the price so I did like that. Also the service is great. I might go here again to try the famous pollo fundido. And also only because my boyfriend likes this place so I'm sure we will be here again"}
{"text":"I Was was so excited to have lunch there. since moving to AZ i have heard so many great things about this restaurant however when I got there totally disappointed the culinary experience hasn't caught up yet in Phoenix,AZ the food was less than mediocre, And the counter tops at the bar were sticky;( this old mom-and-pop joint, is thumbs down for me.......;("}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Pollo Fundido. They are super generous with the creamy jalepeno sauce they top it with.

I've been here twice now and the 2nd time I swore I'd try the Chili Relleno but I couldn't resist the Pollo Fundido. Finance was happy with his combo plate both times as well. 

Can't beat the house margaritas, they are amazing. 

Salsa and guacamole is awesome. 

The location is a little questionable and intimidating, that is the only reason for 4 stars.

Food, drinks and service have never been a problem here. 

I highly recommend Poncho's, we haven't found a single place that beats it yet."}
{"text":"Came here the other day and i honestly feel like this place is overrated. Ordered a tostada and it was SOGGY by the time it got to my table. For this kind of food it's nothing I can't make at home."}
{"text":"The food was good. The salsa and chips were freshly made. My plate was served. With beans and cheese just the way I like it. The server was very nice."}
{"text":"I feel like a less than glowing review of this place will get me kicked out of South Phoenix but here goes: the food is just okay and the prices are higher than they should be. I feel like the historical significance of Poncho's as a South Phoenix staple has created a false picture. I can spend less and get more higher quality food just outside of South Phoenix or I can spend less and get the same quality food within SPHX. Either way I actually cannot remember the last time I was willing to pay Poncho's prices. It's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Yeah, pretty decent mexican food, GREAT big giant margaritas.  

Done lunch and now dinner 3 times here.  I don't wanna advertise this too much because I'm afraid that if too many people catch on, the restaurant will figure it out and put a stop to it BUT...Once a buddy and I figured out the secret to getting hammered on their margaritas for cheap:   Order a pitcher of margaritas with NO ICE.  They are OK with that!   You get 3x the amount of margarita, and they will still bring you glasses full of ice.  Go figure.  Winning, Duh!  

I guess by reading these reviews that it's hit or miss with the food, but their margaritas are worth going there for, even if the food does suck on your particular visit. They are just damn good margaritas. KILLER margaritas.  Seriously.

Also, regardless of the food and other qualities that make a restaurant what it is, my take-aways are always based to some degree on how good of a time I had there.  If the food sucks, but I still have a good time, I'm gonna remember that and that's gonna be reflected in my reviews.  Maybe it's just the good company, I don't know, but at this place, I have always had a good time, and I don't remember the food ever being less than good.  

Go have yourself a good time!"}
{"text":"I have heard many good things about this place and then saw mixed reviews on Yelp.  Bill Clinton even ate here.  (I don't think George Washington slept here!  You east coasters will get the joke.)

My overall opinion is that Poncho's is a run of the mill Mexican restaurant.

- my server was very nice and attentive (except for refilling my water) but the kitchen was very slow

- the chips were fresh but still very greasy

- the Pollo Fundido, one of their signature entrees was a good sized but soggy chimichanga with lots of moist chicken stuffed inside it.  It was then drowned in a white cream cheese jalapeño sauce.  All very salty to me.

- I ordered rice and beans that we're okay at best.  I know they are refried beans but these were also greasy.

Bottom line - with over 20+ Mexican restaurants within a few miles of here I will continue trying new ones vs returning here.

Sorry Poncho's!"}
{"text":"Honest Mexican restaurant. Extensive menu, never been disappointed. Although I usually opt for the Poncho Villa. There is a mural of Bill Clinton, he dined here when he was president. Ladies still like to take their picture at the Clinton table. (Actually, under it)! Excellent party platters at a good price. Only drawback, it's getting harder to pop in for lunch."}
{"text":"We found Ponchos by stumbling over it while looking for another address. It was lunch time so why not???  The short review is - just stop what you are doing right now and go there for lunch! You live in Tucson and it is in Phoenix? I don't care, leave early it's worth it.

OK a bigger review.

Big surprise! 
First -- The parking area is deceptive - go to the back instead of squeezing into one of those front spaces.

Then - go in and ignore any line that might have formed - it will clear up really fast.

Now sit down and prepare to be surprised. I bet you think most Mexican food is just Lettuce Cheese and some meat arranged in different presentations with Salsa. Well that is true but Ponchos actually is a different taste and it is wonderful. 

Chips - the chips are light and crunchy not burned, thick and greasy. You may well ask to buy a bag of them to take home. We did. Twice now.

Salsa - the salsa comes in a squeeze bottle and I was really skeptical because I like it in a dish  to dip out of. The salsa is best served like they do it and it is spectacular. Not to hot, nice tang and flavor just goes all over your mouth. They provide a dish if you want to put the Salsa in the dish. (get takeout to go with those chips you are going to buy)

I have now had Tacos (you just have to always do that) and Enchiladas. Both were an experience. My associate had the red chili in  a burro and  I tried it. You really should just drive there to try the red chili.

This is a small thing but I like coffee and restaurants frequently keep coffee around or do not have it ready. Ponchos keeps fresh coffee hot and ready, and it is good coffee.

My only issue - no Posole and I bet these guys could make a killer Posole."}
{"text":"The host was a little bitch....telling me that she needed to get past me....well if she paid a little bit of attention she would've noticed that i had nowhere to move bc i was letting her customers get past me...as to the food, it was good i ordered some chimichanga or.something that had white cheese on it...either way it was good ...the set-up of the tables sucks....feels like an overcrowded military cafeteria, not a restaurant"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is delicious. The salsa is fantastic and better yet, they sell it. Took home a pint and plenty of left overs. Knocking one star off because service can be extremely slow at times."}
{"text":"Just went here with the hubby because the yelpers said it was awesome. I ordered the pollo fundido and it was awesome! I have never had it before so maybe I am looking for the wrong thing because I dont have anything to base it off of. I scarfed it down. it was amazing! 

Hunny got two beef tamales. I was disappointed by them. They were just pulled beef in a corn tortilla, not wrapped in the corn meal and husk. He scarfed them down anyway though (he doesn't know he was cheated).

We will definitely go back, when we can fork up the money. It was a little pricey for the quality of the tamales but other than that it was great."}
{"text":"More customer service. I had called my order in the said 10 minutes so I get there in 15 minutes still not ready took an additional 10 more minutes.  when I got up to the window it took them 5 minutes to even acknowledge I was there. A girl seen me didn't smile or nothing and just started putting cups up. Not once did she say she will be right with me. Not good service at all"}
{"text":"The food here was shockingly awesome given its appearance!  

We went here randomly because another restaurant was closed.  It does not look like much.  Sketchy parking lot - complete with a pile of vomit by the ramp!  The inside is cramped.  We ate in a room that looked like it had been something else originally, with way too many tables crammed in.

I ordered a pina colada, and stupidly chose the large size.  Large is a ridiculous understatement!  This thing was the size of a fish bowl or something.  Not one of those stupid beta fish bowls either.  The large drinks mean business!!  It was pretty good too.

Everything we ate was really, really good.  I had the burrito and my friend had a taco salad.  Everything was great, including the salsa, but the taco shell was AMAZING.  So perfectly cooked and tasty.  It's weird to get this excited over a taco shell, but it's totally warranted.  So good!!  I would definitely go out of my way to get something with this amazing shell in the future."}
{"text":"Well, I have been coming for any years. I don't live in Phoenix anymore but it is tradition to come to Ponchos every time we visit our family. Today we had an issue with a food item. Katie D our server along with the manager adjusted their policy to make us happy, Great restaurant, great service, great prices"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place probably since I was in the womb. They have good prices and good food. I love the chips and salsa. I wish they still did the cheese crisp on mondays for free after 5pm (maybe they will bring it back hint, hint)...
It is in a smaller converted house in south phoenix with a take out area in front and a bar in the back. This place fills up quick on the weekends be prepared. Only thing I do not like is sitting out in the main area when you first walk in everybody is looking at you when they walk by I prefer the back room or the bar.
YUMMY...... food try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Waited 25 mins for some Chips and Salsa...only to get across town and don't have what I paid for. So o call to tell them it's not right and they ask can I come back. No I won't be back for a long time.."}
{"text":"Came back again with the same person insisting the place was great. 

I avoided the single flauta meal ($7 for a flauta with beans and rice), and got a #7 (chile relleno, rice, beans, and a flour tortilla) instead. No regrets. 

The food was great this time around, and despite being a really packed night, our waitress tonight was very attentive. She frequently brought refills and more chips and was prompt in clearing plates and bringing the bill. 

Left full and satisfied this time. 

It was probably just a bad combination of bad server and disappointing food last time that led to the poor rating, but I'd definitely recommend the place now."}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale for business and my local cousins took me to Poncho's for dinner. This is their favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. I tried the sampler with a presidential theme. Good variety of the Mexican dishes available. I enjoyed each piece of the plate and the addition of a large marg made it even better. I have it on his authority that the pollo fondito is awesome. Why only 4 and not 5? Slow to non-existent service at the front and really short handed waitstaff."}
{"text":"This place is still as good as it used to be way back in the day! Poncho's has that real and authentic Mexican food. All of their items are delicious, and I do mean all of them. Please do yourself a favor and eat at Poncho's, you will not regret it. Oh, and their red salsa is muy delicioso! Prices are more than reasonable for the quality of the food that is served. Also, expect to wait a bit for a table on popular nights such as Friday & Saturday. But the food is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's exactly what I'd expect for an old school Mexican food place. Yeah, it's cramped a little. It's old. The food is the best Mexican food for white people in Phoenix. The hot sauce is to die for. Chips and fresh and endless. I love the gringo Fundito. If you're thinking about eating at this place, stop thinking and start getting down there to get a seat. It can get crowded very quickly. End of story."}
{"text":"Ponchos is an average to good place to get take out or eat in Mexican-AMERICAN food. That is to say It is fried, topped with cheese, and not to complex. The prices are good and the service is fast and because of this is a staple in South Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best straight-up sit-down Mexican restaurant in Phoenix!  I've driven over 40 minutes on several occasions just to eat here.

This place is really tiny, but that's because it used to be a residence.  Eventually the business grew so much that the owners moved out and converted their home into a restaurant.

The food is great, and really inexpensive.  Everything I've had is excellent.  The staff is friendly and the service is fast.  It's one of the places I like to take visiting friends and family."}
{"text":"Not the best, but definitely not the worst. Good is always consistent and reliable. Waitresses are nice, and usually on top of our needs. Food usually comes real quick. If you are looking for a solid Mexican food place, this is the right choice."}
{"text":"TALK ABOUT GHETTO!! I was disgusted to be honest. Walking into that place was like walking in to a old Crack house turned mexican restruant. First off, I don't mind driving out to a good mexican restruant, but seriously this place was so dirty, run-down, and as I could tell not run by good management. SECONDLY, and i could not believe this even happened, as soon as we sat down there was a full on fight between customers in the bill Clinton room. I had my phone out ready to call 911 because this fight was going on way to long.  It is such a small restaurant, with family and kids at just about every table. What kind of family restruant has a fight break out? A ghetto mexican restruant does. And not only that but the silverware, the pee yellow cups they use for water looks like overused cafeteria cups from the 90s. I think the only reason this place is still open is because the locals in South pheonix must not have any other authentic mexican restruants around. Anyways just so many things about this restruant is soo unappealing, i dont know why I even went. The worst experience at a restruant ive ever had. Not to mention we called earlier in the day to make reservations and they still seated us in the wrong place. Food was whatever, and service was below average."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. The chips and salsa to start are fantastic and the Pollo Fundido is insanely good"}
{"text":"My friend reminded me of the best part... When we walked outside after our horrible meal, there was a nasty used green condom on the floor. Yuck."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place.  Authentic Mexican food.  I had the beef tacos and beef tamale plate with rice and beans!  So yummy.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Cheesy.  Truly, it's a little too cheesy for my tastes, although I've grown to accept this as a normal problem with these Americanized Mexican restaurants.  But this is a great little place that has dining inside and a take-out window outside.  It's a great place to pick up an enchilada-style burrito on the way home."}
{"text":"I loved their food ,but the service has gone down.You now have grumpy waiters,that don't care about the service. I'm done going there."}
{"text":"So good here.  So good.  I asked my friend who lives in Phoenix what's a place that is \"Phoenix\" and I can't eat anywhere else.  She recommended Poncho's and man, I am glad she did.

I had already eaten a bag of Ruffles sour cream and cheddar, so my stomach wasn't feeling that great.  But I had to get the pollo fundido, and it was amazing.  It was pretty big.  Ok, enough about that, just know, it was amazing.  I am salivating thinking about it.

The chips and salsa was great.  Everything was great.  Go here for some authentic Mexican food.  Yum."}
{"text":"Poncho's is one of my favorite spots to come to with my family & co-workers. The food is great and very rarely do I have any complaints on it. I would give it a 4 or even a 5 star if it weren't for the hit and miss customer service. The last time I was there for lunch with some co-workers, we had crappy customer service. Our waitress was very short and dismissive. She barely looked at us when talking to us. She slapped the receipt on our table and ran off. Didn't ask us if we needed anything else or if it was all on one bill. When we told her we were paying seperately, she took off again and brought us back our separate receipts. She was annoyed that we didn't tell her we wanted separate checks. Um.... she didn't give us a chance!"}
{"text":"Yeah,  wow,  Poncho's this Mexican food is amazing.
I just knew I hit the jackpot after I saw my first order, the sampler platter.
tamales are great here i get the green corn.  Man I'll drive here just to fulfill a tamale attack.  

The place has a cool set up winding around room to room it just never ends. I\"m glad its open a little late for those late night customers.  

Watch out for lunch here during the week it can get full, its one of those place people know where to find.  Just of Central in South Phoenix.  I don't get out here that much 
Destination location for sure.
My personal note: we live in Arizona, experiencing some of the best Mexican food America does not know about  makes me really enjoy the valley

{"text":"For being a legend I would say that Ponchos is not up to par, nor do they have the best authentic Mexican food in south Phoenix. The albondigas soup that they make is always too salty, and the meatballs are never fully cooked. I've ordered the soup many times in hopes that it will be cooked and they fail every time. I always end up putting my soup in the microwave to completely cook the meatballs. The tacos are extremely greasy, and the restaurant needs renovating. The chips and salsa is about all I will eat. I've been asked by coworkers on where to go for great Mexican food and I always advise them to go to Comedor Guadalajara. Ponchos is NOT the bees knees and I would avoid it. Sorry but they just don't cut it."}
{"text":"A Phoenix Native friend introduced me to this local gem years ago. So I've been a loyal customer to this awesome, amazing establishment for almost 10 years to date. The food is always out of sight, delicious, fresh and always on point. The prices are very reasonable and one definitely gets what you pay for. No matter what you order from their extensive menu, I don't believe you can go wrong. My ultimate fave at this place is the Pollo Fundido! The picture in my post does not do it justice . The white jalapeño sauce is to die for and illuminates my taste buds . It can get very crowded at times but it is definitely worth the wait. I have yet to have a bad experience with the food or customer service. If there is any \"complaint\" I have about this restaurant it's that it can get a bit loud with the crowds that are present at times. But, if you don't mind a lively establishment to enjoy tasty Mexican food, then definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! I'm not a huge fan of dining in and the pick up window is shady at night but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, and Poncho's just might be why.  This restaurant is great...the food is soooo good.  I love the chips and salsa and the Mexican pizza, bean chimichanga and the bean and cheese burrito enchilada style are my personal faves. 

The servers are very attentive and prices are reasonable.  If you like Mexican food and you haven't been to Poncho's yet, you definitely need to add it to your list of top places to go for good Mexican food. 

Be forewarned that the food isn't healthy Mexican- this stuff is loaded with cheese and flavor!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and my favorite place in town. This meal Is always two hours long though, service is extremely slow no matter which server you get. One of my top request is don't starve my thirst and refills are hard to come by. Food makes up for the slow service, be sure to check out the coupons in the newspapers and weekly adds."}
{"text":"Great food and selection. Highly recommend for those looking for a nice family type establishment. This is a great place to take out of town guests who are interested in trying some good Mexican food.

The restaurant gets crowded and there is often a wait but it's worth it for the experience and the food. Be sure to go in the right door or it's a bit confusing."}
{"text":"Food was ok typical Mexican food the atmosphere was busy and it was a little warm inside. It's a small place and they thrive off of Bill Clinton having eaten there. I give it a 3 for food and service. However the margarita was no joke it was strong and tasty. Maybe I am a wimp but it knocked me to the floor."}
{"text":"I love ordering this for pick up. Very authentic feel, and if you actually dine in it's entertainment/people watching. You pick your food up at an outside counter which is very cute. The food has always been good. Best tacos even to.go! They put them in a separate wrapper. Fresh crunchy shell and moist shredded beef. Yum!"}
{"text":"First of all, I love this place. I plan to come here regularly as long as I live in Phoenix. Before I go on to expound upon the wonders of my first dining experience here, I need to make a brief but passionate comment about the location of this restaurant. I agree that Poncho's  is a gem, but I think it does a disservice to the residents of this area to think of Poncho's as good *given the area*. Part of what makes restaurants like Poncho's so great is that they are family-run, with the passion and experience of many generations fueling their current success. In my limited time here, South Phoenix strikes me as an area that has a lot of heart and soul to it - a lot of the homes in the neighborhood have been in the family for generations, and certain restaurants here reflect this sense of the past and of community. I loved my first experience at Poncho's because it's such a great dining experience with real ties to the South Phoenix community, not in spite of this fact. 

OK, that being said, on to the food and drink! We started with thin, crispy, perfectly salted chips with some hot salsa in a bottle - best starter ever! We ordered margaritas, and our waitress (who was really down-to-earth and helpful) asked if we wanted the \"big bowl\" ones. \"Hmmm, why not,\" we said (they were priced at $6.50, which is really reasonable). And we didn't regret our choice! They were a little sweet for my taste, but they still had a really great lime flavor and tasted pretty strong. Much better than the limeade Los Dos Molinos tries to pass off as margarita mix! And once we had them along with the chips, the mix started to taste less sweet and became the perfect compliment to the spice of the salsa. 

When we first saw the prices of the food, we were shocked! It was so cheap! It's really impressive that the owners have managed to keep the quality and portions so high while keeping prices so low. Based on Yelp reviews, I recommended to my husband that he try the Pollo Fundido (~$7). I tried two a la carte items - the chile relleno w/ chicken (~$5) and the shredded beef enchilada ($3.50). Everything was so rich but so good! The fried shell and the jalapeno cream cheese on the Pollo were so satisfying, the enchilada sauce was really flavorful, and the chicken was moist. The beans and rice were also really good. We enjoyed every minute of our entrees, which we continued to wash down with the margaritas. 

We left feeling full but satisfied, and we definitely look forward to coming back soon (perhaps for happy hour or to sit in the cantina, which was really lively). Thank you, Poncho's! I'm glad you exist!"}
{"text":"I just wanted to make a comment and a recommendation. Every time I order take out, the packaging is the worst. Beans are very hot and put in a Styrofoam cup with a very thin lid that melts due to the heat and the beans are always all over the place = huge mess. They also put the hot sauce in the same cups and your lucky of the lid is on snug most times the chili spills all over the bag. I would hope that they would invest in some better quality to go paper goods.
Food is always great the 1 star review is due to the to go containers."}
{"text":"Not impressed. 

I got the shredded beef chimichanga with red chili for the 1st time, long wait (about 20 min, with only a couple of people waiting) and it was really good.  Went back a second time and was not expressed with the green chili, had to many big pieces of onions in my chimichanga.  I really liked minced onions and these were Not minced.  Maybe they should warn you about the onions!!  

The last time we went back the lady at the take out counter was not in a good mood.  we ordered a chimichanga with red chili and a smothered chicken burrito.  She told us it will be 45 minutes.  So we patiently waited for what we hoped was going to be good Mexican food.  45 minutes later we got our food and ordered was all wrong.  She gave us a chicken chimichanga instead of smothered chicken burrito and a plain bean burrito.  We referenced back to our receipt and it was not itemized, no details of what we ordered or what we were charged for.  It took another 30 minutes to have them retake and fix our order and then another 30 minutes to get our food. We waited 1hr 45min.  service was horrible and 8 dollars for a burrito that we waited almost 2 hours to take back home and eat... Will not be driving all the way to south phoenix for Ponchos."}
{"text":"Hmmmm....didn't really impress me when i heard former President Clinton ate here in a whim on one of his trips in PHX. i was more distracted by this eatery being centrally located on a grimey street as well as the odd smell that greeted us in the narrow halls of the waiting area. It surprised me that the odd smell did not deter the number of people who were dining here. There was a brief wait time as this small eatery was packed in every room-including the bar's dining area. There was also a wait for the takeout line which they had conveniently outside...must be something worth yelping about....

So i decided to order what my cousin has been raving about-the chimichangas. I've eaten many a chimichangas before but never...a beef chimichanga... even with its regular guacamole +sour cream combo ever touched  the one i had at Ponchos! Simply stated-the overall meal came fast, FRESH & was filling. Now i understand how certain foods can trigger a massive release of endorphins throughout your body....i stuffed myself enough to put me in a food coma. Now i understand that i could never go back to a 'chain' Mexican restaurant again. 

Affordable as is delicious-Ponchos proves that QUALITY of food isn't necessarily determined by price-as some of the best & most authentic cuisines are truly hidden treasures in local neighborhoods waiting to be found...thank you cousin for helping me discover this gem!

The menu may look very typical (http://www.ponchosaz.com/eimenu/) but you'd only know the taste difference if you ate here & experienced it for yourself. Poncho's wont disappoint."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over 20 years now and their food is always amazing! I definitely recommend getting a green burrito with one of their famous margaritas. They also have great happy hour for appetizer and drinks."}
{"text":"WARNING: Everything is super deep fried... Been here twice and everything was way to greasy.

Have have been told they have a great happy hour including $10 pitchers of Margaritas. I'll shall have to try and repost my findings..."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've ever had. Came here all the time as a kid and will continue to come here as long as I'm in Arizona. I've had bad service here but you get that everywhere you go. I will continue to come because the food is that good. It's even worth a 2 hour wait."}
{"text":"I went to Poncho's for my first time and I will not be going back after this, The young lady in the front was SO RUDE and was also taking personal phone calls while we were waiting just get seated & the place wasn't even full for the time we had to wait  and another reason is it's so expensive and the food is no good. My nephew ordered the carne asada and it was so flavorless and dry, We told the waitress about it and she even agreed and she even said that no one ever ends up liking the carne asada. Luckily she was nice enough to take that plate off our bill. The only thing I liked was the chips!"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican American food. The place is like a old house with very low ceilings. The service is very non memorable.

Serving sizes were quite large."}
{"text":"Price...Da' BOMB!
Food...Da' BOMB!
Service...Da' BOMB!
Ponchos...Da' BOMB!

Highlight: Chicken Fundido w/ extra Jalapeno Cream Cheese...Manifiq!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, authentic style Mexican food! The drinks were delicious and not over priced. Food portions are huge! The only downside is that during dinner it's VERY busy, worth the wait!"}
{"text":"To give you an idea of what I thought, I was going to take a picture of my meal... but I ate it first.

I got the Pollo Fundido, which is their signature dish. it was fantastic. It's basically a chicken chimichanga enchilada style. The sauce on that smothers the chimichanga was the most delicious sauce I've ever tasted. I took a bite and couldn't stop eating. It's like they took all that was good in the world and put it in a sauce. 

The chips were also very good. In all honesty, the first batch was good but the second batch of chips were a little stale. Still, a must stop for lunch or dinner if you're ever near South Phoenix.

I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Such good food. I would suggest this place to anyone visiting the area! Oh, and Autumn was an awesome server!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food. Don't judge this place from the outside lol. But very good. I got the pollo fundido with extra sauce. Husband got the chicken tacos with a cheese enchilada. Salsa was spicy and addicting. I just wish my side of jalapeños were fresh sliced jalapeños not the pickled kind to add more kick to my pollo. Service was great and prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Every time we make the trip from Tucson to Phoenix I get this craving for Poncho's.  The building must have been an old house from the 1930's and converted into a restaurant.  There are so many nooks and crannys to get lost in.  But when you make your way in you are greeted by this lovely older lady who is full of piss and vinegar with a great sense of humor who leads you to your table.  We were there Sat. at about 2.00PM.  The place was packed with large families who seem to know the wait staff pretty well.  Everyone is so friendly and efficient which is a plus. Now to the real test.  The food is wonderful, rich in flavor and beautifully  presented.  Unfortunately, I am a wuss and order the same gringo dish (Chicken Enchilladas with green sauce)  Hubby orders Chile Relleno, tamale, combo plate.  The thing is those onions which are sauteed to perfection slathered all over the dish including the rice. This makes me real happy.  If you love onions this is surely the place.  It's a \"must go\" when heading up to Phoenix."}
{"text":"What a gem. This place might need an external makeover but don't judge it based on that! We had some reasonable margaritas to start. They offer complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa is super addicting!! The chips are warm and taste fresh. I ordered the green chilli burrito with beef and it was so yummy! You can get rice and beans as a side if you wish but the burrito was plenty of food for me. It comes with guacamole and sour cream on the side. Delicious! There were several things on the menu I was interested in trying. Now looking at yelp, the pollo fundido is definitely on my list when we go next. Probably a new regular spot for my parents and I. Also, I will add that the prices are very reasonable. Check this place out. Bill Clinton approves."}
{"text":"I went to Poncho's today for lunch with the BF and it was ok. The place was very busy, so I thought that was a good sign. We waited for a bit before being seated in one of the small rooms in the back. We were given chips and the salsa in the bowl and promised salsa in a bottle. The chips were very greasy and not that crunchy and the salsa tasted like very peppery ketchup...ick. After 5 minutes or so we were given the squeeze bottle which contained a very similar, but slightly less tomato -y, salsa...not a win. For lunch, I had the mini pollo fundido and the BF had a taco and tostada. My food was alright, the chicken on the inside of the burro was nothing special, but the sauce was good and the rice was really good. Sort of what I expect from a cheap Americanized Mexican restaurant. The BF's taco was fine....also nothing special, but not bad. The prices were decent and the portion sizes were too large. I think it's super funny that they are clinging to the fact that Bill Clinton ate here 15 years ago or so, they have the newspaper clippings all over....I definitely lol'd. Anyway, I wouldn't avoid this place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good Mexican food this is the spot! Whether you're looking for take out or dine in, you will not be disappointed. Their chips and salsa is delicious and service is wonderful! I am always impressed when dining  at a restaurant and refills are brought out before my drink is empty. Every time I've dined here I have always gotten refills (without asking) when my drink is half way done. And I mean every time, now that is wonderful service!!! Cost is fair for the large food portion given. Definitely a five star restaurant for great service and wonderful food!"}
{"text":"I just got take out from Ponchos. Mom and I both ordered green corn tamales and I had my standard shredded beef taco too. I usually get a taco from there whenever I'm in Phoenix. They're just the best shredded beef tacos anywhere. Mom paid for the dinner so I didn't want to tell her my tamale was truly horrible. It was like mush and there was no corn in it. I quietly took it to the garbage and dumped it in. Then mom said, \"My tamale is terrible. How was yours?\" \"Terrible,\" I admitted. She through hers away too. If it wasn't so late, I would have just taken them both back and asked for a refund."}
{"text":"Great food but terrible service by the beaners they have running the place that can't even speak english"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant style place. Staff works very hard and this place can be quite busy. Hey there early for lunch and best the crowd. Food is great and the chips and salsa are very good too."}
{"text":"I had a chicken burrito and a beef tamale, both with green sauce & rice.  It was all delicious! The only complaint would be that the tamale was kinda light on the beef and heavy on the masa. Our waitress was very efficient & accommodating. I LOVED their fresh, warm, light & crispy tortilla chips. The salsa was pretty good, too. I also loved the paintings on the walls there, one being of President Clinton dining there. Overall very enjoyable dining experience. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican food restaraunt.  The #4 lunch is the awesome, red or green burro enchilada style, rice and beans.  Good chips n salsa too. The pancho villa burro is good also.  My mom is a picky eater but ate her whole burrito when i took her."}
{"text":"Since my last review, we have had a few trips where the service was great! Food is amazing as always, they definitely deserve the 5 star"}
{"text":"Poncho's is one of the many places that you're tempted to not review because it means more people will come.  The place is already packed almost any night we go so it's not like it's a secret, and most everyone knows about how Clinton ate here when he came to town which gives it some good Mexican food street-cred.   That said, I still know folks who would go to a chain restaurant instead of driving into \"South Phoenix\".  They have no idea what they are missing.

First of all, don't confuse Pancho's with Poncho's.  Pancho's is a Mexican buffet place near the Rhythm Room where you raise a flag for service.  Poncho's is an amazing restaurant with roots in Phoenix that are deep and wide.

Poncho's was created oh so many years ago by a woman who made food and sold it from her house.  Food was so amazing, business boomed even back then.  They added a walk up window to the front of their house.  Then a few tables outside.  Then they figured they might add a few tables inside.  Pretty soon they realized they needed to move out and turn the whole thing into a restaurant.  Good choice.  

I don't know how to recommend anything on the menu because everything I've tried is great.  In my household Chimi's reign supreme.  I'm a fan of a few of their combo meals. Close your eyes, point to the menu, eat.  That's my recommendation.  It will be good.  

There is a back entrance to a lounge area where you can sit at the bar or one of their tables.  Full menu service is available.  It's an awesome place to watch the game on their big screen.  Everyone has been super friendly when we've been there.  The smallish rooms created when you make a house a restaurant can get a bit loud, but it would be worse if we were in one giant room.  Again, I've never been here when it wasn't hopping.  Tuesday, generally one of the slower nights, we had a 10 min wait for a table. It's never insane, but the biggest negative has to be their waiting area.  Or waiting hall I should say.  The door in is say 6 steps to the hostess booth down a \"hall where you can touch both sides with your hands at the same time easily - but there is a long bench on one side.  Since the place is packed most nights, that means a row of folks sitting, and a row of folks standing against the wall.  If this wasn't all close enough, new folks sometimes try to walk in and go up to the hostess area, or meet friends in the restaurant so they are walking down the middle.  That said, we have had some fun conversations while waiting.  Last Friday night the hostess (and older lady that I'm guessing is a partial owner) was busy running around and getting a drink, so young lady said to all the new groups that walked in while she was out, \"Well, I've been coming here since I was 6, so I'll play hostess\" and she started putting our names down on the list.  That turned into a \"who's been coming longer\" competition which was won buy a guy in his mid40's or so, we didn't ask, who'd been coming almost weekly since he was 4.   Funny how those tight quarters can lead to some pre-dinner bonding/story-sharing.  

So on top of the friendly folks, the great service, the fun wall painting (The Clinton room, as mentioned below, does have a picture of him painted on the wall.  It also has a painted representation of where his secret service guy stood during the whole meal.  One of the bus boys heard us showing it to someone and he stopped to mention to us, \"Yea, and he looked JUST like that ALL night.\"), the amazing food, and the short from down-town commute - these are some of the best dang prices you are going to find for real sit down service anywhere.  Every once in awhile we'll get a coupon for $1/off a chimi and we often don't use them because the bill is so low it already feels like a deal.  On a recent dinner, for 4 adults w/ full meals - but no bar tab, it came to $37 AFTER a 25% tip.  

How many other places in Phoenix can you dine with a President for that price?"}
{"text":"The fondito burrito is always my go-to at Mexican restaurants. However, the one I had here was the undisputed worst that I have ever tasted. The chicken tasted really old, or perhaps it was the kind canned like dog food. I don't know. The tamales that were my appetizer, were far from appetizing. It was like eating soggy dumplings. By the time I received my burrito, the service was as delightful as the meal. After tasting the vomitous chicken, I told my waitress that I didn't like my meal. She then asked me if I wanted to box it up to go. Seriously?! I asked another waitress(the highlight of my visit) for a manager and asked for recommendations. I must admit, this waitress was very honest with me (after I struck out with my meal). She let me know that the chicken and Carne Asada are sub-par, notified a manager, and removed my meal. So I'm thinking  why doesn't she speak freely to the cook? But that's none of my business. My secondary meal was the sampler. The canned refried beans were the stars. They really outshined the other beef jerky like, leathery meat on the tostadas."}
{"text":"I think this building was a house before they turned it into a restaurant because the halls are a bit narrow and the rooms are a bit small, but the food is great! They give you chips and salsa while you are waiting for your food and their salsa is home made and delicious! Their margaritas are amazing and huge (if you get the large) and pretty strong ;) . I wouldn't suggest you don't go on a Friday night for dinner because they do get pretty busy and the wait gets pretty long."}
{"text":"I don't know why I do this to myself... My brother told me about this place and bragged about how Bill Clinton would come down to eat here, and how their albondigas were almost as good as my moms, and how great the tacos were. Clearly this made me want to try it. We all went Sunday after the football game and it was pretty busy so I automatically thought it must be delicious. The building itself is older and looks like they haven't spent a dollar on cleaning, or on any upgrades. We sat down to a sticky table and ordered our drinks, and ordered our food soon after. I got Albondiga soup and 2 tacos. When my soup came I asked for lemon which I never got and the albondigas were waaay overcooked, I had to use my butterknife to cut thru them. When the tacos came I realized I could have gotten these at Filibertos... Nothing special to me about this place. Overall the service was descent, prices were cheap but the food was well below mediocre. I would have rather driven thru some place. My brother deserves a slap to the face for even thinking this place was descent... This place needs to stop living on the hype of Bill Clinton and make some changes... 

Last Note: Bill Clinton should be ashamed of himself to think this place was bomb... He needs higher standards!"}
{"text":"Wow.. a waiting line on a Friday afternoon means somethings good here.. I was not disappointed. Love it all.. the presidents plate is amazing, service it top notch I will be back.. chips and salsa alone are like crack. I can't get enough"}
{"text":"So tonight was a different experience than in the past. Tonight, we had our meal as usual. When the server brought us the check, she said \"the credit card machine quit working so you have to pay cash\", I said, \"I have no cash, can you run it manually?\". She said \"Sylvia, the manager, said to go to Food City across the street, they have an ATM\". 
So I had to get in my car and drive in the middle of a crazy rain storm to get cash. 
Had I known this when I first went in, I wouldn't have stayed OR I would have gone to the bank, get cash and come back. 
I know my business means little (or nothing) to them, after all, I've only been coming here for only 11 years. I've seen some bad reviews for Poncho's on here because of poor service. 
I get it now. 
Sylvia, is this your idea of a back up plan? A good manager would come up with a solution that is good for both the business AND the consumer..If there was only a way to process credit cards manually.. hhhmmmm!"}
{"text":"Well the first two times we went there the food was great. This time it was obvious that they use canned chicken and the portions size are almost half of what they used to be. It's a shame their chicken fundido was amazing, but with the canned chicken it's gross. So to management yes we noticed you changed to canned chicken. Might want to go back to grilling your own chicken."}
{"text":"We love the food here however the takeout has gotten really slow. We ordered at 5:58 pm tonight and they said 15-20 minutes. We are still here waiting at 6:39 with no food. It would be okay if we didn't have an impatient 2 year old in the car, it's exactly why we got take out!! I have been going here since I was little and we love the food hopefully they can get more help or expect to wait."}
