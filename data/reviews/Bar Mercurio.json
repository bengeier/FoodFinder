{"text":"This was the best meal we have had in Toronto. Fettuccine with Morrell mushrooms and sea bass ravioli. Robert was a gracious waiter and host."}
{"text":"Awful. Awful. Awful. My boyfriend and I walked in and we were greeted by the host. It was early (about 5pm) and it was empty. We were told we would have to be out soon as there was reservations coming in, but he said we should still have time. So right off the bat, we felt rushed, and he was pretty rude.
We sat down, and the waiter came over to take our drink orders. He was friendly enough, and  we told him we just wanted to start with water while we looked at the menu. Next thing you know, we were brought a bottle of water. We ultimately decided that we weren't going to eat here because they made us feel rushed. We were there for maybe 5 minutes total, and had to pay $8 for a bottle of water we didn't even get to drink. Or order."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first and last time a few months ago. The reason that I'm writing the review now is because I sent the manager two emails explaining my awful experience, and he didn't bother to respond--so it's fair to assume that they don't really care. 

The food is not bad, but the service is awful. The wine is very overpriced so I expected the service to match up to the price, but the staff are so uncourteous and rude. We had to be somewhere and we told the hostess that when we walked in, but the pizza took so long that we had to have our salads and then come back after our meeting to eat the pizza (all of which we had already paid for, by the way). That wasn't even the issue. When we came back and ordered more wine, the 3 ounces looked like a tester, so we said \"go ahead, no need to taste\" and the waitress said \"no, that's it!\". It was kind of hilarious and we were in disbelief so she decided that she would take a shot glass and prove that the glass she poured was really 3 ounces, which is rude and uncalled for. We told her that it wasn't necessary and that we believed her. The service just kept going downhill from there. Had to ask for things again and again, and when we got them it was with lots of eye rolls and attitude. The wine glasses smelled like the dirty rag that they used to dry them, which is so gross! I contacted the manager, he gave me his email, I emailed him twice and received no response. So, now I'm writing this review. 

You'll get better service at Fox & the Fiddle next door. I should also mention that the dress code for the girls working here seems to be shirts as dresses...we got an unexpected show with our meal at the bar as the bartender was putting the glasses away. Unprofessional all around. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Incredible meal, great service and great atmosphere, this place (though pricey) is terrific. I had a very memorable experience and recommend it to anyone on a special occasion or looking for a great meal."}
{"text":"Very much enjoyed the food. Would have liked better service. The waiter who greeted us didn't check our reservation, just asked us to wait at the bar. He pointed at the 2 bar stools for the three of us. We had to arrange our own seating asking the couple next to us if we may take the stool that was in the corner. When dinner is priced this high, I want service. Next he tried to seat us without realizing a group of 4 were ahead of us. Sloppy mistakes. Dinner was delicious but overpriced. Don't need to go back."}
{"text":"Three of us girlfriends were looking for a place to grab some good eats and catch up - one of my friends suggested this place.  While the food was tremendous, I have to agree with the others on their reviews about the poor service.  It was atrocious.  After having made a reservation, we were made to wait for over a half hour sans explanation.  Once we were finally seated, instead of being offered an explanation, or offered a glass of wine, we had to literally beg someone to take our order.  And to top all of that off, I swear that the back of my chair must have been bumped by servers passing by once every five minutes.  It starts to get old after the first couple of times, and no one bothers to even excuse themselves, never mind apologize.  While I was initially tempted to go back with my husband due to the enticing smells and lovely ambiance, I really don't think I have it in me to sit through an experience like that again.  And it's not exactly like you're getting a good deal either, so the least you could expect is good service."}
{"text":"Walking through the polished wood doors at Bar Mercurio, transports the bloor street pedestrian into Europe. Or a bougie facismile thereof. 

Either way, the long narrow room, beautiful bar, royal blue accents, little round tables and open kitchen make for a pleasing space, while the simple Italian menu (salad, pizza and pasta) and good Italian wine list pleasure the mouth. 

I'm addicted to the calabrese pizza with a douse of chili oil for good measure; but regularly wish I could also order an omelette (comes topped with sour cream and caviar). The pastas are well done, though the gnocchi is often heavy in texture. Of the salads, I've only tried the tuscan bean, which has been different each time, and never really on the mark (too much bean; too much chicken; too much onion; not enough of anything etc.). 

All in all, its my favourite place on this part of Bloor West, and a lovely spot to enjoy a glass of wine and some well done thin crust za."}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner here on June 22 for about a hundred bucks (incl.tip) and it was so awful that I had to have dinner a second time at home. Everything tasted like sawdust. The bread was so hard that a second bite would have meant a dentist visit. A pasta dish with shrimp had just one overdone shrimp and lots of cheap mussels. The spaghetti on the other hand was undercooked. They just don't have a selection of beers and prefer you buy expensive wine. The waiter is good at acting but not so good when it comes to service.
The Menu print is so small, that in that dim light, one has to have 20:20 vision. I have managed without glasses for 72 years; maybe it's time to see an Optometrist. I guess that would be one benefit of going to this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good wine and food, but overpriced. Comparing to real italian restaurants in Italy - nothing to compare, because Mercurio is typical \"american style\". 
Might be ok to drink a wine and talk, but that's it."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, friendly & attentive service, and we found the food came out surprisingly fast! A little pricey but no real complaints."}
{"text":"Lunch just ok -- and pretty expensive. Service not TOO bad, but a bit slow. Foccacia bread a bit dry & stale. Arugula salad good except for the cherry tomatoes that were a little off -- beet salad quite good. A couple of years ago we had a good dinner there, but wasn't that pleased this time. I wasn't impressed enough to order coffee & dessert."}
{"text":"We spent $800 for a group of 9.  We ordered every appetizer and several bottles of their shiraz. We all mixed it up with our entrees, most going for their acclaimed pizza.  I on the other hand went for their \"special\" which was gnocchi with Gorgonzola cheese and some other kind of goodness......

The place found us getting wait staff asses in our back or our chairs knocked constantly.  Our waiter made us aware of the fact that he just \"had to finish up with another table\" then we're all his.  Ummmmm we rarely saw him and in a pricey place like this with my buddy who was willing to just spend anything on his company's dime you wouldn't expect horrible wait staff to disappear for 30mins at a time or longer. We found ourselves wondering where he was OFTEN.  What happened to us being his main concern? Obviously, that never happened.  Horrible service. We got there at 7pm and left at 9:30 which isn't a very long time by any means, but we literally waited about an hour or more for our entrees to come and than if you didn't have the pizza your portion was the size of an appetizer, which - ok, I get it, it's about presentation and quality - would be ok, but I could actually count on one hand how many gnocchi I had in my plate and it was $20???  That's just ridiculous I don't care how pretentious you want to be, make it an f'ing solid plate of pasta!

I'll never go back here unless he wants to drop his own dime here again. Unless you're walking around with too much money in your pocket or trying to impress that special someone you won't see after 2 dates because she was just dating your restaurant choices and as  soon as you choose something else she becomes busy - I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Oh how I love this restaurant! If I could afford to live in their neighbourhood I would be there ... A LOT. I would feel comfortable sitting alone at the bar or bringing friends-date-family-colleagues for a meal. The food at Bar Mercurio is consistently great. They take great care in their food, its presentation and their attentive service. I have been eating there for several years, and it is ALWAYS great! There is something on the menu for any one (eg, any age, taste) and their wine list is quite exhaustive for a bar/bistro. I need to eat there more often (and I am going to!) Their pizzas are heavenly and their pastas are amazing. There is a teeny patio out front is you'd like to sit outside. I always get a warm welcome and I am not a regular."}
{"text":"We went for someone's birthday. We got sat at the very back of the restaurant behind the pizza oven, very warm place to sit. But was good for the cold night. 

Biggest problem I had with the food is the lack of seasoning. I could tell they were a lil short handed in the kitchen but the need to check the seasoning on everything that goes out of the kitchen. The pasta was very good and cooked perfect. 

Sometimes less is more. Everything was well thought out in flavour department. Just the amount of each ingredient on each dish needs to be liked at. I had the insalata with crab, avocado, and quinoa. I finished the salad but still had 1/2 cup of crispy quinoa still left on the plate. I felt like I ate the much! 

The desserts didn't seem all that impressive, so we decide to skip them. This place could be outstanding with a little more attention details."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. Also great service. Steps from the holiday inn. Waiters were nice, and the atmosphere is excellent. If you don't like fancy pizza try somewhere else. Nice wine selection, too."}
{"text":"I really really liked this place, but I think that it is a bit over priced for the quality of food you are getting.  It has been a while since I went, but I think that I ordered some sort of creamy pasta dish.  It was very yummy, but as I mentioned, a bit on the pricey side.  I went with a large group, and I found that the staff was very accommodating and polite, and I had a good experience.  Our waitress took our order promptly, and the food arrived in good time, despite the restaurant being quite busy."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It is totally wheelchair accessible which is great for everyone - no high stepping as an obstable.  Lots of very attentive servers, they made a fuss of us.  Loved the attention.  Food was fine.  

The only complaint was that there were no umbrellas in their outside seating area.  Other than that - a first class, respectful place to enjoy."}
{"text":"Really really good restaurant.  I had the arugula salad with crispy quinoa dungeneous crab salad and roasted lamb ribs.  The salad was one of the best I have ever had, goat cheese, beets, mandarin oranges, arugula, crab with a avocado lime dressing.  DELICIOUS! 
They served us  bread that was baked with onions and green onions in it with a hummus dip. 
My friend had a red snapper fish, cooked to perfection with corn salsa.  We had just the right amount of food for the both of us! Really tasty and will definitely go back for that SALAD!"}
{"text":"The pricier cousin of l'espresso, this place is a dine in place.  Kind of looks like an italian estate inside as it is designed with marble and statues.  I'm fairly impressed with the quality at this place but the service i received was just so uninspired I don't think I could do it again.
I hate snoot from my server, and I truly think I received that here.  poor poor innattentive service.  NOT something I'd come back for and I would certainly not PAY a pretty penny to be treated this poorly."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this Italian restaurant on the way back to my hotel and decided to give it a try. Luckily the food exceeded my expectations, everything was so darn tasty and fresh!! I found out that the owner is a real Italian and so were the waiter and the manager. The service was great and all the food the waiter recommended me were spot on! Sono tutti buonissimi!  Even the simple insalata caprese was amazing, the mozzarella was sooo soft and delicious, it was the best!!! And their pasta is all homemade and perfectly cooked!! I loved their orecchiette, one of the best orecchiette I've had!  I must warn people that this place is not cheap..... it's rather pricey and I must admit I felt it was a bit overpriced.....but I'd probably go back!!! Yes it was that good..... I'll give them 5 stars next time if they prove to be excellent again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hangout on campus. Be sure to try their hazelnut biscotti and macchiato. Service is always great as is the ambiance."}
{"text":"Food is good, but a bit over priced.  The atmosphere is intimate and quaint and a great romantic place near the annex, but without going to Yorkville. 

I went there with my mom on a Friday night for a late dinner. No reservation was required. however, since it was so late, the bread we got, clearly was a little stale. 

We got the grilled octopus with chickpeas and pancetta. It was yummy but for $19, it's an indulgence. 

My mom got the Capon with frites. Capon is a type of male chicken. I hate chicken breast, but this half chicken was amazing. Soft and tender and juicy, and crispy on the outside. Served with frites, it's $29. 

I had the Fettucine with truffle and mushrooms and parmesean. I found that it wasn't cheesy enough, and it was good, but a bit salty. For $20+ however, it was good portions that make you full up, I even took some home. 

The servers here are really friendly. And we heard them telling the chef the feedback that the brussel sprouts were undercooked. 

Wines are available by the glass, and they have an extensive list including Prosseco. They are a bit pricy at at least $9 a glass.

Total bill with appetizer, 2 glasses of Prosseco and 2 mains was $91. Too much for a casual dinner. 

Although good food, I can suggest a better Italian restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"Decided to come here as it was close to where we were staying and based on the positive reviews.  Was not disappointed as the food tasted wonderful even if a bit under seasoned. I just wish our server had come around to refill waters and ask how the meal was even once before cashing out our pricey meal.  I don't mind paying for a great meal provided the service is outstanding...but other then the initial greet and taking of our order our server was almost non existent till time came for the bill.  

I did not like feeling like a sardine, this place is pretty packed tight with tables, as other reviewers have mentioned.  If I were the owner I'd take out a few to allow for more space and maybe require reservations to stagger meals during busy times.    Heaven forbid trying to squeeze your way around without bumping into other diners this is no way to create good feel vibes.

Place has great pizzas and plenty of wines by the glass although I wish the prices on them were not so high. I'd of had more then one had that been the case.

I hope the owner or someone associated with this place reads the reviews and seriously takes notice.  This place could really shine if just a few simple changes are made."}
{"text":"Great Italian place in the heart of U of T

Owner is nice and makes sure guess are happy with dishes

Authentic, unpretentious,  value, decent menu"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by the concierge at my hotel. It will definitely not disappoint. The service was very efficient and friendly, but the food was awesome. If you like artichokes you MUST order their appetizer with the garlic and oil and cheese. I ordered the pizza and that was great as well. This is quite the gem in the middle of  downtown Toronto. A must if you are in the area."}
{"text":"What kind of restaurant doesn't have a high chair? Also, food was horrible and over priced. Look at any picture of their flat, burnt, crunchy pizzas and tell me it looks appetizing. Will not return."}
{"text":"I got a fresh fruit juice here yesterday and while the flavour was really good, it was like room temperature warm.  Warm juice. No thank you."}
{"text":"There were many tasty things appetizers we ate. I ordered the Halbot as my dinner choice, it wasn't the best it wasn't the worst. The appetizers and dinner were small portions, and the fact that everything costs and arm and a leg was not worth it. I expected more from an Italian restaurant. So far the best Italian restaurant I've been has been in Scarborough, I was hoping that Bar Mercurio would be up there but it fell flat with the small portions and the blah tasting Halbot."}
{"text":"This place was a 50-foot walk from our hotel, so we figure, why not?! I felt under stressed in a t-shirt and sweats as I gazed around the restaurant at all the dressy people, but the host definitely made me feel comfortable as I was not underdressed. The restaurant is small, but awesome. It was like a \"class hole-in-the-wall\". Lol. I ordered the 12oz filet mignon with gnocci Gorgonzola. VERY good. The service was also impeccable. Everyone was working together so seamlessly. I really enjoyed myself there and would highly recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The service here is unbelievably slow. We waited twenty minutes last night before our server came over in a huff to begrudgingly take drink orders. After that he was aloof and evasive all night. The food was not bad but nothing special."}
{"text":"Our party of four had a reservation for 7:45 -and showed up a bit earlier - on Saturday evening. The restaurant was not particularly busy. There was only one group ahead of us. After 20 minutes, when we asked what the delay was,  the response was \"We're sorry, why not buy a drink at the bar.\" Eventually we were seated around 8:20. Whether they had deliberately double booked, or merely couldn't predict how long prior patrons would take, we felt poorly treated. We certainly weren't offered anything to compensate for the hassle. There are lots of other restaurants in Toronto to try rather than one that thinks its doing you a favour by letting you eat there, and making you wait well beyond your reservation time.  I'd give this one a miss."}
{"text":"A good place for a light lunch or snack, excellent desserts and coffee after or before go to Royal Ontario Museum."}
{"text":"This place is a date restaurant for sure, but actually it's too noisy for normal conversations.  Like trying to have a nuanced discussion in a bar.  Of course lots of people try that too so maybe you wouldn't mind.  I didn't come here on a date but being dark and fancy (full of ritualized fanciness rather than simple high quality) that is clearly the point.  The food was above average, but not great, especially considering the price.  Since I'll be living and working around the corner I'm sure I'll come here again, but I wouldn't walk an extra block just to come here."}
{"text":"There's something literally dark about this place... LITERALLY. I get it that it's trying to achieve a cozy atmosphere but I was seated by the corner fearing for my friend's life... checking fish bones in dim lighting. The place is small and intimate but not exactly cozy. 

Their tilapia was delicious and BIG. Tried the pizza too and it was deliciously topped with fresh pears  - our server requested for the pear to be added. The servers know how to work their customers (those who tip well). 

A three course meal may cost you as low as $ 50 which I think it's cheap for this type of place. Me and my friend's bill was $ 200 but we ordered plenty. 

My first experience was not good - my seat was lame. 

But if I'm going to judge this place just for food... I would have given it four star."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our latte and macchiato in this pleasant restaurant.  Good pastres in the morning. Ate outside in a lovely spot shielded from the street. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic food--homemade gnocchi & pastas by Mama Mercurio; 10 gourmet pizzas; great (but price-y) wine list; warm & professional service by Roberto, Barbara. & Nicollete at dinner, & Sarah at lunch. A truly Italian-family restaurant - except better"}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch. Great menu with very attractive wait staff. Venison rigatoni had good flavor but the $20.00 price only buys a very meager portion. Bottled sparkling water bottle $7.00.  be prepared to pay neighborhood prices"}
