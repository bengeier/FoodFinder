{"text":"Thanks to my husband, I have an affection for Tastebuds.  I have even convinced my co-workers to make the trek and they have not been disappointed.  The selection is tasty and the staff super friendly.  If you are looking for a menu suggestion go straight to the roasted salad.  You will be rewarded nicely."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. It's well worth getting in the car and driving to if you work downtown. The meatloaf is surely some of the best I've had. Salads are great as well and filling. No need to call ahead; the food is nearly already prepared. Just tell them what you want. I will be going there regularly."}
{"text":"Two words: Fish Fridays. 

Honestly, I've loved everything I've ever had from Tastebuds, but I have a love affair with the almond crusted tilapia they serve as a special on Fridays. It comes with wild rice and green beans. The sherry beurre blanc sauce they drizzle over the fish and rice is nothing short of amazing. It's a bit expensive, but the quality and portion sizes make the price more than fair.

It breaks my heart that they aren't open for dinner."}
{"text":"I go on a quest to find good lunch most Fridays.  Tracked down this place without too much trouble, its in a big nondescript brick building on E.30th right before St. Clair.  Look for the signs in the window and on the door.  I'd heard about the rush so I came a bit before lunchtime and there was no line.  The staff is super friendly and courteous, answered all my questions with a smile!

I ordered the Greek pasta salad with Feta, pine nuts and grilled chicken.  Really, really good, the chicken was moist and the feta added a nice bite to the veggies, and the pine nuts a delicious nutty crunch!  Looking forward to checking out the rest of the menu (pizza, hot sandwiches, salads, etc.)  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place has so much character and charm and the food is amazing also!!! Great staff that make u feel like a regular even on ur first visit!!! Try this place everything is fresh and very tasty!!! U wont be disappointed! !!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch today and was pleasantly surprised. I got the Wednesday meatloaf special and it was amazing. The meatloaf was juicy and seasoned well and the garlic mashed potatoes it came with were also excellent. The waiting line went super fast and there was plenty of seating even during the busy lunch time. The building had a nice atmosphere with bright colors and paintings. Also parking and clean bathrooms are a plus."}
{"text":"Traveling on business again... My host suggested Tastebuds for lunch - WOW! What a great lunch! I had the Greek Pasta, the house specialty and it was great. A full plate of pasta with olives, artichokes, pine nuts, seasoning, chicken, and lots of other awesome stuff that I can't remember. A very filling meal for $10. A couple other folks in our party had the daily specialty - a southwestern chicken fish and they were also very pleased. 
This place is hard to find... Its in an older, brick building and there's no obvious sign so trust your GPS."}
{"text":"It really is a secret of Cleveland. East Side of the city, only open for lunch and the building is tough to find. Then you open the door and you are greeted by the aroma of a fresh kitchen making scratch food and the whole place is filled with business professionals on their lunch break. You gotta check it out!"}
{"text":"The service here is a little meh. The food is just okay, the prices for the portions are incredibly high. Their wraps are incredibly small, I think the must order them special becasue I have never seen a wrap in a place like this be so small. When this first opened there was nothing else around, but now there are so many other places to go for lunch in the area that are better. I wish them well but they aren't very accommodating with substitutions becasue everything is pre-made and not made to order. I don't know why anyone would go here when Crust is across the street."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, really good food. Would rate higher if I could. Was greeted the second I entered the restaurant, really friendly service"}
{"text":"Excellent salads. Had the almond orange salad.  Very fresh. Great service. Very cute restaurant."}
{"text":"I come once a week but today came with my hubby and he had the meatloaf which is a special, it was one of the best I've had! Even better than mine. The prices are a bit high, but worth it for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"The food is consistently very good.  Almond Crusted Tilapia is delicious and a favorite along with the Greek Pasta, Meatloaf, Salmon and Burrito.  Roasted and Toasted Salad with chicken is a great salad.  Variety of pre-made wraps."}
{"text":"I admit it...I have a bit of a love affair with the Greek pasta.  I'm there 1-2 times a week to get it.  The pine nuts, the olives, the feta...I love it all.  It's a little pricey for lunch at $10 but I'm stuffed after eating it if I'm able to finish it at all.  It's a cute place and the line always moves quickly.  There's a parking lot next door or a number of people choose to park on the street.  They also have their space available for rent for private parties!"}
{"text":"Came from the airport as I'm visiting from out of town. Long line out the door went by fast and the food was really good"}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to lunch spot when I'm on the east side. It is set up cafeteria style, so you just go in and get what you need, nice and quick! They have a lot to choose from (amazing salads, wraps, pizza, burritos, salmon dinners, chicken entrees & pasta dishes). Im being serious when I say that if I named my favorites I would practically be naming the whole menu! The owners are also there a lot, very friendly, and working hard, which I think is really cool! I also went to meet up for lunch with a colleague and we lost track of time;not once did they rush us out or even say we needed to leave. I felt bad about it, but they just smiled and said its okay! This place is always busy, but it never seems to interfere with their exceptional quality of food and service. The only con I can think of is that I wish they were open later!"}
{"text":"I will back you up Ryan. This place is fresh, fast, and friendly. The only down side is that it will leave a bit of a hole in your pocket, but it's worth it for food that's real. Turkey Avocado wrap is a favorite as are any of the salads. Their balsamic dressing is so good they sell it in unmarked water bottles- no joke."}
{"text":"Tastebuds is one of those hidden treasures in downtown Cleveland. They do not allow special orders because everything is premade. You can do simple tweaks; like adding grilled chicken to their ginormous salads. I am a fan of pretty much every one of their salads. They have daily specials as well. They do a phenomenal job, very organized and oh so fresh! I don't think I have ever had anything bad there. 
They are only open Monday-Friday during lunch hours. I really can't wait to get back to Cleveland to have lunch there again."}
{"text":"Everything at tastebuds is amazing! The atmosphere is great, and the owner is also pretty great! :) You HAVE to eat here!"}
{"text":"Daily specials never disappoint! Freshly prepared, home cooking! It really can't get any  better!"}
{"text":"I'm really hesitant to give this 3 star review, based on the other stellar Yelp reviews, but this was my first time at Tastebuds and it was just, OK.  Tastebuds has been on my bucket list of places to try for some time.  I decided to venture there for lunch today, having previewed the menu on-line.  I arrived at approximately 11:30, the place was busy, but not packed.  I ordered the Spicy Chicken Wrap ($6.50) and a bag of baked Lays potato chips ($1.00).   I'm not sure that the wrap was worth the $6.50 price, maybe if it included a small side.   The wrap contained a generous portion of grilled chicken, sliced avocado, scallions and a spicy asian aioli.   As other Yelpers have mentioned, the sandwiches are pre-made and sit in a refrigerated case.  I probably would have enjoyed the sandwich more,  had it been made to order.   Sitting in the case (even though I'm sure that it had been made this morning), made the wrap just a little bit doughy and the aioli was just a little bit gelationous, which masked the avocado and overwhelmed the sandwich.  I would have liked a little bit of crunch in the wrap, perhaps asian cabbage or beansprouts....maybe?   Also, I thought that there was way too much aioli in the wrap.  Serving the aioli on the side would have been better.   There was a steady stream of customers while I was there, so this place is pretty popular.   Looking forward to returning, but will choose a different option....maybe a salad or the signature Greek pasta, both of which looked very good.
To be continued......"}
{"text":"Excellent  food!! Super clean and best of all fast and efficient service. I stop here for lunch when I can and its always great. I like the portobello mushroom sandwich the best with a side salad . Plenty filling and healthier than anything I eat .  Definitely try it if you haven't"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars because I keep returning over and over again for their consistent quality food, you feel good about eating here because they have such healthy choices along with some sinful tasty ones. They are so reliable to be delicious every time. The only thing that cant make me a regular is the price. It is reasonable for the food, but I cant swing $11 everyday for lunch lol Other downfall is their hours. They are only open until 2 so if you get stuck in a meeting you are racing over there to get food before they close and since they cook fresh you sometimes end up with slim pickings late in the day. 

The staff has been consistent for a while which is nice. You have regular staff and regular patrons. They are like a well oiled machine when taking orders and getting things out to customers. You can either dine in or take out. I would say they do equal business for both it seems like when I'm there. They have plenty of seating with a private seating area in the back as well. They also cater, I've had friends who have used them and loved the items provided. 

My favorites: THE PASTA! oh my lanta, the pasta. They ask you if you want feta cheese and pine nuts added to it which makes it phenomenal. I also dig their almond orange salad (their poppy seed dressing is yum!), lemon pepper chicken (lightly breaded and subtly lemon flavoring), their green beans (so tender), and meatloaf. Everything is good though. Those are some of my regular \"yay's!\" when they are available. The salads all come with a cornbread muffin which is incredible and moist and I add chicken to my salad, you can add salmon and such as well. 

This will continue to be one of my go to lunch spots, alternating with souper market (my other healthy fav). If you haven't checked this place out come on!! Try a salad and a hot dish at some point!"}
{"text":"When I say EVERYTHING here is GOOD, I mean it. The atmosphere, the service and especially the food. While I am a creature of habit and usually just go with the broiled salmon and herb green beans, I've bought everything else for the other half to try. We have yet to be disappointed. The almond crusted tilapia is a must try."}
{"text":"Do you ever eat lunch? If so, you must eat at Tastebuds! Greek pasta is light and fresh, tomato soup is rich and filling, black bean soup is the BEST/only black bean soup I've ever tried, pizza is unique and slightly crispy, salad dressings homemade and full of flavor. My dad insists on this place any time we're in the area at lunchtime and gets the Greek pasta every time. 

Only open for lunch and they get busy so come prepared with what you want  and get there before noon or get ready to spend some time figuring it out while you wait in line."}
{"text":"Had lunch from here twice in 2 weeks. Once take out the other, dine in. CUTE interior, excellent Greek Pasta Salad, wrap is yummy.  Want to try Salmon soon. Didn't know it was open just 4 hours though. Get there by 1130 otherwise, you will wait.  Delish."}
{"text":"You will miss this place if you don't look. Hidden in a building up a set of stairs, right next to Zygote Press. But this cafeteria style place is pretty great. I've had their salads, which are pre-packaged but sure don't taste like it. Everything is so colorful inside as well, which is just cute and happy."}
{"text":"You have earned this update Tastebuds.  I reluctantly ventured back this afternoon for a quick lunch after hearing from so many people that your food was amazing, and figured \"Why not, I'll give them another shot!\"

WOW - I am obsessed with your Greek Salad.  It is so delicious - with a wide variety of flavors.  I opted to add the Grilled Chicken on top, which was so tender and perfectly seasoned.  I loved every single bite, and was sad I didn't pick up some dessert as a prize for cleaning my plate! 

I'll be back for sure - I honestly think I may be addicted to this salad."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my sister here today! We both had Lemon Pepper Chicken which was the Thursday special and VERY tasty. If I hadn't read it was in an old building (looks like a former school) we probably wouldn't have found it. It was quite hot inside which is my only complaint, the line was fast despite being out the door (it is cafeteria style) and everything looked good (pizza, wraps, salads, etc) I want to go back and try a salad! I didn't see a parking lot, but we found a spot on the street next door. Very busy for a Thursday afternoon, lots of workers in the area seemingly, looks like it could be difficult to grab a table at times! Fun, unique place to try with home cooked food!"}
{"text":"Tastebuds is what I love about Cleveland. In this town, you can have good food and a terrible location and people will find you. Conversely, you can have a great location and terrible food and you'll be boarded up in six months. Tastebuds had great hot entrees, imaginative tasty salads and delicious sandwiches in a brightly painted warehouse space with big windows and art on the walls. It's cafeteria style with fast friendly service so lunch is no problem. Yes the building is old and the houses across the street are a little worn, but go!  Relish in the spot's Cleveland-ness! Take an out-of-towner and eat better food than most of the joints uptown that are charging 50% more."}
{"text":"What a well-kept secret!  Quick good healthy and fresh. Really nice artist paintings and a pretty cool atmosphere to eat.  Bummer looks like they're only open for lunch.  Otherwise I think anything they would do breakfast or dinner would be awesome.  I had the meatloaf green beans and mashed potatoes.  Nice good flavor top of gravy.  Get some you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Came for a work lunch and got the mushroom sandwich. The sandwich was delicious and the atmosphere was great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a great lunch spot just on the outskirts of downtown! Easy to get to and plenty of street parking, the restaurant is nestled in a historic mixed use building and has a cozy and colorful vibe.  Staff is super friendly and the cafeteria style ordering is a great way to see all their tasty options and get your food quickly so that you can get back to work if in a hurry."}
{"text":"Love. I just finished eating here and I already can't wait to come back. First, I was blown away by the fenced in free parking. No need to find a meter or lot like most restaurants downtown. I walked in and there was a line. I grabbed a menu to look at, but I'd recommend maybe looking at the menu before coming so you don't hold up the line. I ordered a veggie wrap and the pasta salad. The line moved wayyyy quick, and before I knew it I was paying. Wrap, side, drink, 10 dollars. And it was DELICIOUS. The service was also really friendly. Some reviews comment that it's overpriced, but not in my opinion. This blows all the other lunch options around here out of the water, and it's comparable in price. Also, I could have easily just had the wrap or just the pasta salad and been satisfied, I just felt like stuffing my face and got both. Even with both, it was worth the 10 bucks. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options, healthy options, and a few unhealthy options and homemade desserts. This is cafeteria style, but there is plenty of space to sit in the nice dining room. I'll be back! Oh, pro tip: you clear your own plates. I had to wait a bit to see what other people did with their dishes."}
{"text":"Second time I've found something in my food that's not edible.   First time was back in May or June of this year I had ordered the black bean soup and was almost finished eating it when I bit down on something hard.  I spit it out and it appeared to be a piece of some kind of twisted metal.  I showed the cashier and was given a refund and told they would look into it as no one was able to identify what it was exactly.  So I didn't go to tastebuds for a little while after that.  I decided I'd give them another try because we all know stuff happens.  It's been going really well until today.  I was eating a salad that I really enjoy from there, and bit down on something hard again but his time I was not at Taste Buds but back at work.   It appeared to be some kind of hard plastic with sharp corners.  I don't think I can eat there again after this, I've been lucky these 2 objects haven't broke a tooth or cut the inside of my mouth.   Sorry Taste Buds, you have good food but apparently not the safest."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!!!! Great service warm and welcoming! Definitely worth finding. Nice laid back environment with a lot of food options. Will return. Closes early though at 2pm"}
{"text":"Tastebuds is pretty good.  Convenient for lunch.  The food here is very bright and just leaves you with a lively feeling.
Must be all the phytonutrients!
Many times at work we order out here for lunch and there is no hassle, no mix-ups, and things taste great.
Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Better the second time! My earlier review stated the bread on the mushroom sandwich was hard too chew. They changed it. Much better!! Friendly fast service, delicious food!!"}
{"text":"I still visit tastebuds every so often since it's close to work, quick and convenient. I did go out of my of comfort zone a few times and try different things and found that I don't really enjoy the Tomato Basil soup. Unfortunately, the starch they add in it makes too tick and grainy, difficult to enjoy. As well, they make great wraps, but more times than none the wraps have a bleach/cleaning taste too it. Not sure how or why, but it's not enjoyable to me. I still think salads are the way to go."}
{"text":"I used to work around the corner from this restaurant. I went there so much I became friends with all the girls that worked there. When I was pregnant I ate their baked sweet potato at least twice a week. Seriously amazing!
If you want a tasty, healthy and inexpensive lunch, this is the spot. 
I miss their lemon chicken and their salmon. I have yet to have better salmon anywhere. I really need to get out there again. I think I'm going through withdrawals. 
Their salads and wraps are amazing too. Their menu isn't huge but I love that. They are good at what they do. 
I recommend this place to everyone!!!!
Place an order for pick up for work or pop in before noon to miss the long line. I always went at 11:30am and it was perfect!
Definitely check this place out! It's not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for nearly four years now, and due to their extremely awkward hours, finally got to try it for the first time today (and probably the only time ever).  Had the Friday tilapia special - almond crusted tilapia over a bed of green beans and rice, and a hot Italian chicken sandwich.  Everything is pretty much premade, yes, but it made the service very very efficient (I had barely paid for my food at the counter and it was already ready for me) and it did not affect the taste one bit.  The sandwich was flavored very well and was not soggy.  The fish was a little bit greasy, but I loved the flavor and the almond crust.

Please open on Saturday.  Please?"}
{"text":"Walked into this place with a friend of mine yesterday and was pleasantly surprised! I had no idea this was here, and the atmosphere immediately stuck me as friendly and vibrant. The line moves fast and the food is decent. I had a chicken sandwich ($7.50) that was very tasty on fresh french roll. The corn bread muffins were delicious too! 

I'm going back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Too bad they are only open for lunch on weekdays only. Their signature Greek pasta is divine and grilled Portobello sandwich is great for veggie lovers. Plus the atmosphere is colorful especially for those gloomy fall and winter days. 

It's cafeteris style so it's super quick. So if you can steal some time away from work ot wherever,  check this out!"}
{"text":"Great lunch place, my only complaint is that they are only open from 11am-2pm! 

Great selection of food, and a daily special everyday. This is good wholesome food like your mama would make. My favorite is the Pepper Jack Chicken meal, with rice, black beans, salsa and corn, topped with a delicious chicken breast. The salmon is some of the best seafood I've ever had. I downright crave the Almond Orange salad, piled high with pieces of fruit, almonds, and chicken breast slices, with poppyseed dressing. $10 too steep for your pocket? Try a $4 slice of pepperoni pizza. It's a delicious fix. Since working in the area, it has been one of my favorite lunchtime stops. It's truly a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely Cleveland's best kept secret. You wouldn't even know this wonderful restaurant was there by the looks of the outside of the building.  My boyfriend was the one who got me hooked to this place. I have gotten the lemon pepper chicken and the salmon and both are to die for. I have honestly never had anything bad at this restaurant. The girls who work there are charming, as well!"}
{"text":"I love this place, quick and easy with no fuss, the food is fantastic, my favorite is the Greek chicken pasta with pine nuts and feta, to die for!  LOVE the hot chicken sandwich, it is truly wonderful with the homemade mayo spread that comes with it.  EVERYONE is so nice and treat you great when you go in!"}
{"text":"My coworker suggested this place to me when I was at a photo shoot in the same building as taste buds. I am so happy that she told me about it. Although you cannot customize in order and less you call it in it doesn't matter because all the ingredients are fresh they all taste great and the only downside about this place is that it's the price but you're paying for what you get. It is worth every penny to have a delicious healthy ones that not only fills you up but also leaves you satisfied. Hands-down the best thing you have to order is on their Thursday's lunch menu they have a lemon pepper chicken with rosemary potatoes and green beans that are covered and garlic. You will never regret this decision! Cannot wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Cleveland and ate here two times because the food was simply fantastic! They have a daily special in addition to a regular menu which is great, simple, whole food. I had the roasted rosemary red potatoes and garlic green beans the first day because I wasn't quite sure about the menu. The sides were so fresh and filling that I opted to revisit the SAME restaurant the following day for a full lunch of broiled salmon, mashed potatoes and of course those famous green beans. My colleagues ordered salads which none of them could finish (they were so large) and a few had the chicken which got rave reviews. I will definitely be back when I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"So I thought I had done this months ago. I love this place and will go back. We stopped passing through Cleveland and what a surprise. Staff was outstanding and warmly let us taste their special of the day. Which I would have ordered but it was a bit much for lunch. Our sandwiches were outstanding moist and very tasty. Yelp this Resturant and treat yourself."}
{"text":"I would have never thought to try this place based on the outside.  Thankfully a client took me to lunch yesterday.  There was a line out the door inspite of the rain and it was worth it.  All the food looked great.  I had a Toasted & Roasted salad with salmon and it really was perfect.  The salmon was tasty and the combination of pine nuts, roasted potato (I know weird), feta cheese, onions was just perfect.  Most of the other diners seemed to get either the greek pasta, or the special (meatloaf) both of which also looked wonderful.  This was the best thing I've ever had in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Such an awesome lunch spot that is just slightly off the beaten path. The Greek pasta is so good and is filled with fresh veggies. All of the salads are good. It is slightly annoying that they are pre-made because you can't make any substitutions. The corn bread is good too."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem. You would have no idea it's there if you didn't already know! It's right east of downtown and has abundant free parking. The lunch only hours keep it busy but the cafeteria style line makes the wait go fast. All the items are pre-made that day and so delicious! The roasted and toasted chicken salad was so big I didn't finish it all and the corn muffin on the side was delightful. Highly recommend for a quick, healthy, delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"Consistently good lunch choice! 

I will usually choose whatever the daily special is and it is always great! The meatloaf is my favorite!!

The salads are large and filling! The price is great and it's convenient for where I work. You may have a little trouble finding it or think you are in the wrong place, just keep going! Good food awaits!!"}
{"text":"Let's be real about the Greek salad.  A Greek doesn't have spinach.  So that tells you that they make the basic salad and throw toppings on top of it.  Also, I can't remember if there was feta on it.  Yikes.  That's two strikes.

Luckily, Tastebuds doesn't earn a 3rd strike.  The line is quick, the food is prepared with care, and it's a likable lunch spot.  I should probably try their weekly special or signature dishes next time, but I can't say they could buy that 5th star, even though they tried with their cornbread muffin (included with a salads).  There was a lot of food to make me happy, but alas it remains a strong 4 star establishment."}
{"text":"I never heard of this place before which is amazing all by itself since it's a great lunch spot!  The food was proudly displayed in deli cases as if to show you that it was all freshly made an not from a package or microwaved.  The dining area was clean, bright and comfortable.  

I had the penne pasta with vegetables, chicken, feta cheese and pine nuts.  The portion was large and the taste was what I would expect from any of the finer restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"I've never been in this area before. If my GPS had not announced my imminent arrival I would have missed it. It's in a space inside a huge brick building on E30th. There's a small blinking vertical sign in one of the windows, but the bright light of day and the the fact the sign was mostly malfunctioning rendered it all but useless. Ample free street parking on E30th. It's near Slyman's Deli if that helps anyone.... 

Anyways, the food was fresh; the portion was generous; and I was pleasantly impressed. The interior is spacious and there were plenty of seats, despite a bustling lunch crowd of people dining in or placing/picking up pre-ordered take away orders. It's quite a cheery atmosphere, with brightly coloured walls adorned with local art. 

There are lots of cold food items to choose from including salads and wraps. These are pre-made which disallows ingredient substitutions. Then there was the hot food item of the day which looked really good today (Tuesday) - Pepper Jack Chicken ($10). This was breaded & sauteed chicken with Pepper Jack, rice, black beans, and corn. I ordered a specialty salad (Roasted Toasted & Grilled - $7.5). This came with mushrooms, bell peppers, onion, roasted potatoes, Feta, and pine nuts w/ Balsamic Vinegrette. I added chicken ($2) to mine and although it was already pre-made in the cooler it tasted fresh. 

I will definitely make it a point to return here - there is a big menu for sampling."}
{"text":"This is NOT where you would take someone on a first date. Here is why.  You are on E. 30th and you know that your date told you that Tastebuds is between Superior and St. Clair. You park inside a pothole as big as your car on the side of the nearly deserted road. On one side of the street are a bunch of semi abandoned homes, on the other some old relics that appear to have been office buildings at one time, but are now crumbling into dust. Your date steps out of the shadows and beckons you toward a dark entrance and up an uneven set of stairs. You say to yourself \"This is where I die. Please make it quick dear Lord\".  He reaches out a hand and pushes open the door to your tomb......and then light floods out at you and you step into a surprisingly beautiful space. The walls are Ochre and Auburn and adorned with original pieces of art. Light pours in from the windows facing the street.  And the smell, oh the wonderfully beautiful smell of lemon and garlic, roasted meats and grilled vegetables, and Fresh bread and just baked cookies. 

Tastebuds is a cafeteria style restaurant and is open only for lunch. But what a lunch it is.  The Greek Pasta is a favorite. Penne with roasted tomatoes, feta cheese, chicken strips, olives and pine nuts in an alioli sauce. Individual meatloafs bathed in garlic. Salmon, lemon pepper chicken, and grilled Portobello Sandwiches.  Homeade cookies and the nicest staff you could ask for. Some people just enjoy what they do and the people that work here are just fabulous.  I know that at least one person who waited on us was an owner. It is a credit to the whole staff that I really don't know which one it was. Every single person we spoke to was so upbeat that it could have been any one of them.

This is the type of restaurant that you want to linger at. Not only is the space beautiful, but the patrons are as diverse a crowd as you will see. From construction workers, to lawyers, to hospital staff. Once you come here you will want to come back. The fact that it is so hard to find just adds to its mystique.  This is where you take someone you want to impress. Whether it is a date, your boss, or a visitor from out of town you will win huge points for being \"in the know\".   And even more points because it really is that good.  A hidden location, amazing ambience, and fantastic food.  There really isn't any place in Cleveland quite like it.  Go once and you will want to come back again and again. If nothing else you will want to work your way through the daily specials. Each one is as good as the next.  Skip the Nantucket Nectar...61 grams of sugar. That's like half a cup of sugar!  That's just crazy.

The road is under construction right now, but there is a parking lot a half a block from the resaturant.  

Stop reading and go!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to eat here for lunch all the time when I lived in Cleveland (but I've since relocated to the west coast). The Roasted Toasted and Grilled salad is absolutely delicious. One of my favorite salads ever (and I love salad)...One of those salads I won't soon forget. Deliciously long and slow roasted veggies, fresh salad, goat cheese, great dressing.... YUM! Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years, and I'll admit the first couple times in went here I wasn't impressed, which I guess is the reason I hadn't been back. I decided to come back and see if there was anything new or different....spoiler alert,  there wasn't. Their menu is almost identical to the last time I was here 2 years ago, which isn't a terrible thing considering they have some standby items that regulars really love (ahem* Greek pasta), but I couldn't help but wish they had something new to offer. I ended up getting the Friday special- almond crusted tilapia with green beans and wild rice. I resisted my inner carbohydrate addict by not substituting the green beans for something else. 
What I'll say about the food here is that it is healthy,  and it tastes like something I'd make at home.... Which is to say,  not bad but nothing spectacular on the flavor spectrum. The almond crusted tilapia was generously portioned,  and the almonds were delightfully toasted. The rice and green beans were also good,  but again,  nothing I couldn't make at home. 

The good side is that for business folks,  it's the perfect lunch option. It's basically a cafeteria for adults. It's quick, healthy and there's plenty of parking  and seating to expedite your work lunch. The price is a bit high for lunch (you easily end up spending $12-$13/person) but the portions are generous,  and all of their meals are well balanced. One thing I wish is that they offered made to order sandwiches, maybe it's just me but pre-made sandwiches in a cooler just grosses me out (hello soggy bread) and without those their menu is pretty limited. I'm being harsh,  but this place really does have a lot going for it,  I only wish they had more variety is all."}
