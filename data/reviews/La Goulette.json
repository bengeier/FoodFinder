{"text":"J'ai découvert La Goulette grâce à mes colocataires peu après mon arrivée à Montréal. Ils adoraient y prendre un couscous à emporter. L'endroit ne paye pas de mine mais les propriétaires (tunisiens) sont super fins et leur couscous est délicieux. J'ai un faible pour celui aux légumes ainsi que pour celui à l'agneau. À noter que le restaurant est maintenant ouvert certains midis de la semaine. Le sandwich aux merguez à moins de 5 dollars est vraiment cool."}
{"text":"On vient ici pour la bouffe tunisienne familiale et l'accueil sympathique. Pas de chi chi. Plats copieux, couscous particulièrement délicieux. Prix plus que raisonnables (11$ pour un gigantesque couscous merguez, 15$ pour une succulente tajine d'agneau aux pruneaux). La salle à manger est minuscule mais chaleureuse. Seul bémol: pas de permis d'alcool. Il faut dire qu'ils font surtout du take-out et de la livraison...."}
{"text":"Bon couscous, mais rien d'exceptionnel au niveau gustatif... Par contre les quantités sont phénoménales et les prix raisonnables, 28,75$ avec taxes pour un poulet-merguez pour deux, à emporter, ce prix comprend aussi une soupe. La salle est pas bien grande et une ouverture dans le mur permet de voir la cuisine avec sa couscoussière."}
{"text":"I am new to the couscous world but am gallantly picking up speed and trying the different styles of couscous offered from around the world. Montreal so happens to be is a great city in which to do this. The couscous here is Tunisian style. The place is very small, with a maximum of 6 tables, all  2 seater aside from one larger table made for 4 guests. The decor and music seems authentic, and the service although rather slow was very courteous  and kind.   Do expect to wait a while for your food, we waited 20 minutes and we were the only guests! But once the food arrived we realized why, it is all hand made and delicious!! The portions are large and two people can eat well for $20!! We stuffed ourselves and had some left overs for the following day. Score!   Need a quick lunch? They also sell merguez sandwiches for 3.75!! Stop by and grab  one to go!  I will happily return!"}
{"text":"This is (was) a wonderful spot.  Very good food and very reasonably priced.  They have been closed for about 2 months -- and now a renovation sign indicates it is re-opening as \"Les Deux Oliviers\".  Not sure if same family --- sure hope so."}
{"text":"It seems that everyone I know who likes this place first went there because somebody else recommended it to them. Which was exactly my case; my real estate agent did when we were in the area. Real estate agents don't exactly have a reputation of being truthful, but she was definitely on the money with this one. I ordered the poulet cuisse couscous, totally not expecting that I would get a noodle/vegetable soup as an entrée, followed by the actual couscous meal which comes with a giant portion of carrot/potato soup and finished off with a cup of lovely sweet tea. The whole combination just worked, with their flavours complimenting each other. You could tell that the food was carefully prepared and treated with respect. I loved my meal and have gone back a few times since. The only downside is that the place is not very cosy and it took awhile for the food to be ready, so it's best to order by phone and pick it up to eat at home. It is worth a try, even if you think you don't like couscous. They converted me!"}
