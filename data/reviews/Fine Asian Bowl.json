{"text":"I had never been here before or heard of anybody who had, when we stepped in on a Sunday afternoon. The place has a nice relaxing vibe to it and the white table cloths and modern yet not sterile decorating add an extra touch.

We had pad thai and spring rolls and both were excellent. Generous portions of pad thai that had just the right amount of spiciness to them. 

The menu was extensive, with a lot of different choices for meat dishes as well as vegetarian dishes. The emphasis seems to be on Vietnamese food.

It was great. Would love to go back and sample some more. Very reasonably priced, as well. Especially if you get to choose from the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Horrible - avoid. Greasy food, low on taste. I nearly choked on a metal staple in my food -- not kidding! This however didn't figure heavily in my rating. The owner stated,\" oops! Next time we will give you a free dish!\". I'll never return though."}
{"text":"Not worth it. My friend and I both felt sick after ordering take out. I suggest going somewhere else..."}
{"text":"I knew it was fishy when you have Thai, Vietnamese and Cantonese food all in one menu. I had a coconut soup curry noodle and the favour was not very thai. The chicken in it was tough, over cooked, it tasted like chicken that was re-cooked many times. The service is okay but the food was not."}
