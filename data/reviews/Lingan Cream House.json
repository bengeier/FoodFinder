{"text":"Dare I say one of the best gelattos/ice cream in the city. Different from the usual texture, but very enjoyable. Staff are nice, looks clean, but a hole in the wall. Repeat: Already have!"}
{"text":"Tamil (sri lankan) style ice cream. The mango and pistachio flavours are so good. However  the scoops are super small. SUPER STINGY with the serving size and the price isn't cheap. It's been small scoops since forever- i would excuse this if the price was cheaper. However, You'll pay $5-8 depending. However their scoops are way to small for that price tag.  Ice cream -3 /5 Serving size - 1/5 Service -1/5  Unless you want mangoey ice cream with bananas and jello at the bottom and the Tamil style ice cream explore elsewhere for your ice cream fix.   Surprised it made a blogTO list. The ice cream is good- but the serving size is blah and the service is not with a smile.  It's decent ice cream, if the price was $ 4-5  I'd excuse it. But so not worth the price- I'd pay less for mango gelato at love gelato. At this price I expect good service and good portions regardless of cultural cuisine."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall Sri Lankan place.   Tried the ice cream for some reason. It was okay... nothing special. Don't recommend that.   What we really liked though were the milk hoppers. First time I've had those. Its basically a hopper (best description that I have for this is traditional Sri Lankan savory pancake) filled with coconut milk. It was delicious... slightly sweet. And only a dollar. Will definitely be back for these.   Tried some other short eats and all were good.   Big parking lot. Accepts debit card"}
{"text":"The Ice-cream - Meh The Falooda - double meh In a city with good ice-cream places, this place serves less-than-supermarket quality fare and gets away with it. Over changing for nostalgia seems to be the ticket as this place had lines out of the wazoo. I would rather just buy a giant tub of ice-cream from the supermarket or a shake from McD for a much tastier experience."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for the ice cream. The lines are long in the summer, and the place is cramped, but it's definitely worth it. The ice cream is creamy and smooth. They have so many different flavours to choose from. I love the twist they put on it by adding nuts and jelly. The sherbet is delicious as well. During the winter, I don't really go. Their short eats are the same as any other South Asian place. Didn't have any special ring to them."}
{"text":"SOMEthing smells good...  Yelp Friend has been well trained. Like a Truffle Pig sniffing for Truffles. I agree SOMEthing does smell Deep-Fried. I walk pass it but she guides me back to LCH.  We stood behind SOME people looking at Hot Tables. Food came in Balls, Sticks, Wet, Dry, Thick, and Thin. SOME Dude made us creamy drinks from a Drink Machine. Drinks came in Hot Pink, Mellow Yellow with colored straws. SOME cold Round Balls were floating in our thick Drinks.  We tried ordering SOME more but Dude gestured, I don't do that shit. Then we were signaled to walk towards SOME friendly helpful Lady. I pointed at the Stick, at the Round Disc with a Hole, and some Balls. Paid 8 SOMEthing, and we walked out smelling like SOMEthing good..."}
{"text":"This is a hole-in-the wall Tamil joint that sells  savory snacks, but is set up in a fairly new cluster of strip malls catering to the savory tongued crowd. I count myself among them. I was told by the people in the know this is the place for uppam. That they make it while you wait and you eat it off of your the hood of your car. Yeah, peeps, no table no chairs. It's a to go place. The Uppam was the best I had in Toronto. They also have savory snacks like Boli, Bondo, Vadey-I mean with name like these you know you gotta try it. I did and they were good. Their Tamil style ice cream, while unique, wasn't anything to drool about. That's why I knocked off one star. The star of this joint is the uppam. The service decent. It wouldn't hurt if they smiled once in a while, but they weren't rude or lazy."}
{"text":"I came here with a few cousins on a hot day for some ice cream. They had a good variety of ice cream to choose from. I had two scoops. One mango and one pistachio. The mango tasted like mango lassi and the pistachio was very good but was expecting some chunks of pistachio nuts in it.   We all had the special which has jelly at the bottom, a drizzle of hot fudge, sprinkled on peanuts and a waffle biscuit to top it off.   Personally, I did not like the jelly. If you like jello, then you'll like this."}
{"text":"Overly sweet ice cream and drinks. I had the falooda which is a ghastly fake pink in color, ridiculously sweet and has fake tasting fruit and falooda noodle pieces. But with all that - I gobbled it to the last drop."}
{"text":"I got the mega scoop sundae (4 scoops) for $6.78. The flavours were there and definitely not artificial. I had the chocolate, pistachio, strawberry and mango. It came with green and red jelly at the bottom and was topped with peanuts. However, the scoops were very small!!! For 7 bucks I was expecting a lot more in quantity! There were also other savoury sri lankan snacks on the other counter of the store. Maybe I'll try them next time since the ice cream wasn't really worth the money."}
{"text":"Not all that impressed with the ice cream I had on this visit. I have been here once before and what I tried (mega scoop sundae) was better but pretty damn expensive. Overall, the products seem to lack in flavour to be quite honest. The pistachio ice cream I tried tasted overwhelmingly sweet and not much of anything else.  This place was listed not too long ago as one of Toronto's better ice cream places. Though they do have many other ice creams and ice cream-based products that I cannot speak for, I am not all that impressed with what I have tried."}
{"text":"Randomly came across this place while doing errands, googled and found that it was featured on blogTO so decided to give it a try. They have canteen Sri Lanken food and icecream+desserts. My girlfriend loves icecream and she said the chocolate icecream was really good. It was smooth and not overly sweet. A size small was $3.50 and if you wanted the regular size that comes with this Sri Lankan type of jelly, it would be $5 something. I got this bright pink sherbet drink that came with jelly and vanilla icecream. If you like the taste of sweet pepto bismol go for it! I personally didn't like it and wouldn't recommend it. We also got fish samosas and mutton patties. There was a lot of batter but it was actually really tasty.    Overall, the good: samosas and fish patties.   The bad: the pink drink, slow service and small scoops of icecream."}
{"text":"Liquid dessert? Or Ice Cream?  For me that's both. Mango Shake with a scoop of ice cream ($3.50) or that Pink Cream Sherbet Sundae ($2.50)?  There are also snacks: Mutton Roll ($1) is light but still have a good kick of spices and Vadai Fritters (3/$1).  There are also different variety of house made ice cream if you just want a cold treat.  Lingan Cream House is a good place if you looking for a snack or dessert...for me that is any time of the day!  Just be warn! The ice cream here is NOT non fat, low sugar or any other healthy option! Expect to have a mouthful of sweetness, creaminess and smoothness!"}
{"text":"So far the only place in Toronto I've found that makes authentic Sri Lankan Falooda. That is the only thing I order from this place and I have done it numerous times. It's creamy, delicious and will definitely give you diabetes. It's worth it.   I tried their snacks once. I wasn't impressed with their rolls."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend to get ice-cream, because she was craving it. As usual, the line up was pretty long. The service was good, because the owner was serving the ice-cream. He was being kind, and giving good scoops of ice-cream (I've heard one girl there gives such tiny scoops).  I got two scoops of mango and pistachio ice-cream w/ a waffle biscuit, and they drizzled some chocolate sauce on top. It was good, but nothing to die for, just regular ice-cream."}
