{"text":"I've only eaten at the pub (basement).  This is a cozy little gem along the Credit river.  My wife and I have been struggling to find decent family friendly restaurants in the Georgetown area after moving from Toronto.  This is one of the best restaurants."}
{"text":"Our friends swear by this place, they have been there numerous times over the years.

No disappointment. The pace is relaxed, with good and efficient, but not overbearing service. The food was superb and not very expensive to boot.

Highly recommended for one and all. We saw families with children and all seemed to have a good time.

You should probably make a reservation or call ahead, they often cater to weddings and other large parties, we were told."}
{"text":"Absolutely lovely! If you have an important event coming up, I highly recommend it - the photo shoot will be superb ;) Also - be sure to try the steak (if you're not a vegetarian, of course)"}
{"text":"Great place, excellent food and service. Upscale inside and casual on the patio with a lovely garden.  Great find."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Terra Cotta itself is adorable and the Terra Cotta Inn is nestled near the credit river in a beautiful building. There's a pub downstairs and a more formal dining room downstairs. The ambiance was great in the pub with a big fireplace going. Great menu from pub fare to steaks and pasta dishes. We both had pasta dishes and they were excellent. We will be back for sure. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My family met on Saturday, June 16 combination birthdays (mine and my son) and Father's Day.  There was a total of 10 of us.  From the moment we walked in the front door we were treated royally. We sat in one of the main dining room with lots of space for all of us. Our server was Laurie who was amazing and helpful to us. The ambience of the inn is peaceful and inviting.  The food is delicious.  Presentation of the food is impressive.  After lunch our family walked the beautiful gardens to the river's edge.  What a great end to a special family day."}
{"text":"Rarely have I found so many Yelp reviews to be as accurate as those given to the Terra Cotta Inn.
 Location: Peaceful and charming. Sitting on the patio overlooking the Credit River was delightful.
Service: Excellent. It was right at the start of lunch and the place was very quiet, but our waitress was attentive, thoughtful and prompt.
Food: Very good, in almost every respect.  Between the two of us, we ordered Antipasto Misto [for two] and a Caesar salad. The antipasto came with warm, fresh bread. The only downside to the meal was that the grilled calamari was very chewy; other than that, the seafood, meat cheese and vegetables were uniformly tasty and the portions were immense. A word of warning: We were both more than satisfied after this meal, so if you do order this appetizer, forget about a main, or you'll be taking it home in a doggy bag.
All in all, a very fine dining experience in a relaxing setting. 
PS: Someone at the front door [manager/hostess?] was wearing way too much perfume/cologne. Not exactly a complaint, so much as an observation."}
{"text":"food and service completely satisfactory;

how it is though, that a golf course will keep you off with out a collared t-shirt, or if wearing cargo shorts, but a middle-aged man wearing a muscle shirt and camoflage cargo shorts was admitted entrance  to this restaurant is beyond me

restaurants need to take responsibility for managing their premises"}
{"text":"How is this classified as an Italian pub?!?!? No way! This is a great 'international' and classy restaurant that sits along the credit river... Seriously the meal plus this absolutely stunning setting are so worth it! To me, it's one of those special occasion restaurants!"}
{"text":"The Terra Cotta Inn is divided in 2 parts. The fine dining upstairs and the pub downstairs. The atmosphere in the pub is cozy. It's a nice  little place to go have some dinner and a beverage. The pizza and their salads are very good. You can order dinner food that is served upstairs as well. The location is lovely especially in the summer because they have gardens and it is on the Credit River."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to have dinner.  They have a dinning room upstairs and a pub downstairs. We had the lamb covered with pistachios with veggies as well as the Greek salad. The salad had a very tasty dressing and the lamb was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth with flavours of fresh rosemary and pistachio. 
The owner was very friendly and accommodating.  He has a beautiful \"backyard\" as he so called it! 
Amazing place!"}
{"text":"I first went to Terra Cotta Inn after a rigorous 4 hour hike at Terra Cotta conservation nearby. Maybe it was because I was so hungry after my first real hike in Ontario. Maybe it was the feeling that I had earned the right to eat as many calories as I wanted. Or maybe Terra Cotta Inn is just that awesome.

There is a formal dining room upstairs, a patio outdoors and a casual pub-like room downstairs. Each has their own menu. The first two times, I went to the pub. After a hike, you want a cool, basement atmosphere with little fanfare, cool air conditioning and a laidback but efficient server.  A tiny bar  with a nautical theme I think, at the corner, tables around the room, the specials written on chalkboards hanging on the wall. There's a speakeasy vibe with the basement windows that stream sunlight in with overpowering the room. 

The food here is consistently good, and the offerings are actually a step above your typical pubfare. There are the usual burgers and nachos of course, but there is also calf liver, curried shrimp and vegetables, a variety of pasta dishes (particularly sea food options). What I like best is the atmosphere. Every time we've been here, the server was quick to take our orders, relatively quick to bring our food, and timed it just right to come and ask us if we needed anything else. But there was no one rushing us, no feeling of impatience - it feels like the sort of pub that your neighbourhood (in a small town) would just drop by, and sit in. Which fits the flavour of Terra Cotta as a whole, this village in Halton Hills.

Terra Cotta Inn is about 35 minutes north of Mississauga, and yet it feels like a world away. There's a sleepy quality in the surroundings, as though the people who live here are from an era long ago. Who go to bed at 8 pm. Wake up at dawn. All know each other. It's not true of course, but it makes me feel like I'm down the street from Anne of Green Gables. Maybe that's why I keep coming back.

(I blogged about this place on my regular blog http://bitesout.wordpress.com/2012/05/26/terra-cotta-inn-halton-hills/ and just got to update yelp today. In between that posting, I've been back a number of times over this past summer - and yes, it's still consistently good!)"}
{"text":"Four of us went to The Terra Cotta Inn for lunch yesterday, what a beautiful setting! They had opened their covered patio so we sat outside. One person in our party had ordered pizza during her last visit and when we asked the server why we weren't seeing it on the menu, the server said that the patio menu was different but happily brought out the pub menu that had the pizza on it. We ordered the ANTIPASTO MISTO FOR A MINIMUM OF 2 OR MORE ($16.50/person) which came with grilled shrimp, calamari, seafood salad, smoked salmon, prosciutto, melon, bocconcini cheese, tomato, grilled zucchini, grilled eggplant, pickled vegetables, olives and roasted peppers and it was really fresh and tastey. For lunch it was actually more than enough for us. We ordered pizza as well, not knowing how large the appetizer was, and ended up taking most of the pizza home. Whoever designed their parking lot is brilliant; there is no curb between the lot and the road, you can just drive right into the spots and then drive out. I would definitely recommend visiting this pretty little Inn."}
