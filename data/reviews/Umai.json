{"text":"Just had a simple lunch.  Spicy tuna roll, salmon and yellow tail.  I was amazed at how fresh the fish was.  I have tried alot of places around Pittsburgh, so far this has had the best quality fish.  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very inviting. While not being an exclusively sushi or noodle bar, Umai pulls off the feeling you have from being at either. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable of both the cuisine being served and culture around it. It's smaller size building adds to the intimate feeling the staff exudes that you are eating at someone's home and not some chain restaurant.

The sushi is very fresh and prepared exceptionally well.  The presentation is excellent and the flavors are wonderful.  There are a few surprises from a typical sushi place here as well.  Umai has both the staple fish one expects and a varying selection of more eclectic items to try every day. The Salmon Gravlax is something not normally seen in the area and is great.  The Ceviche is another item that surprises with it's fresh yet classic flavors.

As for entrees, the noodle dishes are the best in the area.  The Yakisoba is great and the Shoyu Ramen is a perfect taste of Japan. There are no better places to have either in the Pittsburgh area. The Thai dishes are a pleasant addition for the spicier days.  The Pad Kra Prao is a delicious example of Thai street food with a sweet base and some heat to balance.

The house-made cheesecake rounds out the dining experience. Not too heavy and just dissolves in your mouth. A perfect ending.

Overall, Umai is a wonderful new place with authentic recipes and a warm staff."}
{"text":"1 hour wait for 2 rolls of mediocre sushi

I went to Umai and I was disappointed with the service. Waited over an hour for sushi. This is especially ridiculous because the waitress only had 3 tables, under 10 customers to take care of and didn't notice that our sushi took over an hour to ... cook? (that's not right) ... to be cut and rolled in seaweed. 

Sushi wasn't great and the prices were expensive. Because the food never came we complained after an hour, The manager only came after we asked to talk to her directly. She explained that our order has been lost because of a computer error. However with only 3 tables (one 4 top, one 3 top and one 2 top) the two waitresses should have been aware of the problem.

On a bright side, the other couple we dined with enjoyed their cooked noodle dishes (pad thai)."}
{"text":"The food and service was substandard. The rice was overcooked. The teriyaki was cold. My curry was watery, and flavorless. The service was below average. In a Asian restaurant I expect properly made tea. I was given a tea bag. 
The vegetable roll I had was made in a tacky Las Vegas way. All I wanted was a simple cucumber roll! 
Save your money, go to the Sesame Inn or Little Tokyo. Another crappy below average place on Beverly. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in hoping for ramen and was not disappointed. The sashimi was melt in your mouth and a fairly large portion. Ambience was very chill, and the waitstaff was attentive. The icing on the cake was that they had both Yamazaki AND Nikka whiskey. You can't find those anywhere!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Umai since they opened. I have found the service and the food to be consistently excellent. Whether you like sushi, sashimi, Japanese-style, or regular Thai food you will not be disappointed. They have an interesting wine selection, not stuff you find in a typical Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for two sushi rolls!  Sushi chef was making additional sushi for tables that had already eaten :(. 

We ordered the spicy tuna roll and the salmon avocado roll,  which we devoured.  Both were definitely fresh, but I wish we hadn't waited an hour for them!

Waited another 30 for our dinners before deciding to just get it to go. Also, no one ever asked us if we needed more drinks. It seemed like there were a lot of employees working, but not in the kitchen. 

I don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon. Unless you have a lot of time to kill I wouldn't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I just happened to be over on this side of town and we are so glad that we stumbled upon this place! It was the perfect meal for our super late lunch. We ordered the crab rangoons and the mix it up sushi entree. The rangoons were shaped like little purses and the wrapper was really light. The sushi was definitely very fresh and had great flavor. The mix it up lets you choose two rolls and 8 pieces of nigiri.  I especially enjoyed that they let you choose the fish. We went with a spicy tuna roll, philly roll, salmon, fluke, snapper, and yellowtail nigiri.  All of it was really good, but the fluke was our favorite.  It was a pretty nice size portion of fish on the nigiri and I enjoyed being able to try a little bit of everything. I'm looking forward to coming back next time we're over that way!"}
{"text":"Great food! Good happy hour, too. Beautiful setting & attentive service. Especially enjoyed the music, a very talented guitarist/vocalist. It was unexpected and very much appreciated."}
{"text":"The sushi is good, but not that good for the prices they charge. $18 for Hamachi Kama-- a small piece of yellowtail neck?! And this restaurant is not even located downtown of Pittsburgh. Tuna tataki was $10 for 5 thin slices of tuna. We also ordered the Toto Roll which was good but on average would normally cost $12. The pad thai lacked flavor so we had to ask for extra flavor to add to the meal. For a hole in the wall place like this, you expect to find amazing prices with amazing food but this was not the case. We recently moved from Houston, Texas and hoped this was gunna be our go-to sushi spot but sadly we are still on the hunt for our go-to sushi joint."}
{"text":"To be fair, I ordered from GrubHub so my experience was only with their takeout.
And it was not that great. 
I waited an hour and 45 mins for my food to show up. I ordered crispy tofu and miso ramen.
By the time it showed up the crispy tofu had turned into a gelatinous blob. The Miso Ramen, which I was really looking forward to was okay... my problem was that the broth was a greasy mess. I've never actually had Ramen before that was served in a broth this greasy. It was so greasy that I discovered quickly that it was inedible. 
It was like making a broth out of just pan drippings from a Thanksgiving turkey.
Fortunately I keep my own miso paste on hand so I just made my own broth. 
I probably won't order from Umai again."}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi and in Mt. Lebanon of all places.  Umai serves real sushi that is really good.  True, the tuna tacos and ceviche are excellent, but the sushi is outstanding.  It's a must go."}
{"text":"Little known fact.  Umai is an ancient Japanese term for \"a flock of headless chickens running around.\"  We waited over an hour for 3 appetizers, that came out 15 minutes apart, with the third coming after we threw in the towel.  The staff was nice, but there are absolutely no processes in place to make this successful.   After we asked for our check, we were told their computers were overworked, so we can just leave.  Thanks for the free drinks and food, and I hope your restaurant flourishes after Gordon Ramsey showcases it on \"Kitchen Nightmares.\""}
{"text":"Dined at Umai for the first time since changing over from Sushi 3.  Sadly, we will most likely not return.  Drinks were good, but very expensive.  We ordered chicken satay as an appetizer and probably about 15mins later our waitress came back to tell us that it was not available.  I think that if there is an item on the menu that is not available the waitress should be informed.  My fiance ordered the Japanese salad and it was good.  When it came to our meals, both arrived incorrect.  Our waitress corrected the mistakes, but I have a feeling my dish was still not exactly what it should have been.  The food was good, but i was not wowed.  I think there are a couple other establishments in the Mt Lebanon area that are better."}
{"text":"Updating/adding to my previous review since I stopped by for some sushi last night. Their California roll is the best one I have had. By far. Actual lump crab meat, not that fake crab stick stuff. Philly roll: also the best I've had. It's so refreshing to find a sushi spot that not only has good specialty rolls, but also does a superb job with the classics, going above and beyond what I normally would expect."}
{"text":"I've eaten at UMAI twice so far with a group of friends and both experiences were wonderful. After hearing great reviews, I had to try it. The first time I went with my husband and two friends. The waitress told us we would a free appetizer for each person at the table who checked in on Facebook! Not limited to one per table, but we could get 4 since we had 4 people! So that's what we did. As for meals, Everybody else got sushi and loved it, where as I got the chicken teriyaki because I wasn't feeling sushi that night, and it was also great. Service was outstanding. 

The second time I went to umai, I got the Thai tomyum big noodle bowl (pictured) with shrimp and it was fabulous! I actually can't wait to go back and order it again! Service also great during this visit. 

I would recommend UMAI!"}
{"text":"Racheal is the best person here. We love her. She is hands down the best person here. High five be to this girl."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout online. I ordered ramen and a salad.
The delivery time was supposed to be an hour-- the food arrived TWO hours later. The ramen was OK but luke warm by the time it got here. The salad was vile. A sloppy mess of 4 pieces of ice burg lettuce with pieces of steak and liquid that filled the container halfway. I'm not sure if it was dressing that was intentional or condensation that ruined it. Definitely disappointed, especially for the price and the wait. Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in along time. So fresh.  Staff is friendly and attentive. I am lucky enough to live close by...but it is also worth a drive -- it's that good !"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Beverly Rd.  The sushi here is a real standout.  Everything we tried was delicious and incredibly fresh.  We also tried the Thai green curry which was excellent."}
{"text":"Ordered a lunch takeout and everything was really really good. The hot app seafood gyoza was hot (if a tiny bit fishy, prob will get Pork or chicken next time) hand made, thin and tasty. Not the usual pasty thick reheated commercial versions most restaurants serve. Tuna taco so good... crispy shell, spicy raw  tuna, crunchy veg. Total yum. Drunken ramen noodles a total delight. Again, thin not thick pasty noodles (if u want those order from Jade Grille) spicy as requested and the chicken was nicely sliced chicken breast, not random  bits and pieces that you typically get from other places. Fresh mango juice! It was apparent that this little kitchen takes obvious pride in what they are putting out. Even the takeout chopsticks are classy, not the cheap pull a parts but lovely splinter free carved sticks. If u can't tell, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to Mt Lebanon.  Great menu, and friendly people.  Tonight we tried the Tuna Tacos.  Yum!!!  They have a nice mix of items from the sushi bar and what comes out of the kitchen.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We came here with a group, it was good for a group but nothing to rave about as far as the food goes. The thai bowl I got was decent, my boyfriend got oysters and dumplings both of which were just okay. I would come back but didn't feel as though the food was anything to write home about."}
{"text":"The place is very clean. The service was good. The spicy tuna roll was average. They use real crab in the California roll."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and every time I am very pleased with my experience. I haven't been there when it is overly busy so there is never any trouble getting a seat. The sushi is very good, and the service is always so great. They are very friendly. The prices are pretty comparable to any other sushi place. I haven't had any alcoholic drinks here, but they seem to have a great selection. I also saw that they have happy hour Mon - Sat, so I need to get there for that ASAP. I will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"really good, fresh sushi- nicely spicy curry bowls were my favorite. menu selection is pretty big -- lots to choose from.  I like that they serve Bell's beer."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of sushi and I found theirs to be of high quality. This was the first time I've eaten here and the few samples of sushi I did have seem to bear this out. The four stars are my initial thoughts as I would not say it was the best I've ever had. I would, however return again to render further judgement. I was there on a Saturday afternoon and the place was not crowded and as a result the service was good and friendly. The atmosphere was comfortable and inviting. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I want to love Umai. I really do, especially since they replaced what was my favorite sushi place in the South Hills. Alas, so far I think my rating is around a 3.5 - they're above the typical \"a-ok\" eatery, buuuuut I'm not firmly in the \"Yay I'm a fan\" camp yet, either.

The good: a lot of the food here is fantastic. Their ramen bowls? Absolutely delicious, easily some of the best meals I've come across to date. Their fish? Fresh and tasty and as good as I could hope for - both the sushi and their cooked fish is wonderful in my experience. So the core items on their menu are solid in my book. I also often indulge in one of their lovely cocktails when I eat here; I'm particularly fond of their mojito. (And as a bonus in the \"good\" category, the service has also been consistently great, no matter how busy the place gets.)

The bad: I admittedly don't think all of Umai's dishes are worth their price. Let me be clear: this isn't dramatically affecting my star rating because I understand that there are a LOT of factors that go into pricing. Still, the prices are worth mentioning; example #1 - there's an $18 eight-piece sushi roll sold here. It's delightful and has some amazing ingredients and is wonderful to taste, but still...$18 for a standard serving of sushi is steep. 

Most of my disappointment and criticism with Umai however has to do with my last visit; while there is some great food on this menu, I learned recently that I will have to approach some of the dishes with caution in the future. When I last dined here I ordered their duck curry, which is advertised as slightly spicy. Slightly spicy it was not - full blown spicy, it was! Even my heat-loving friend said it was spicier than he expected. Given the way the dish was presented on the menu, I really felt as if the kitchen wasn't fully on the same page as me. 

The verdict: While I considered its predecessor a great place to visit for lunch and dinner on a semi-regular basis, the new menu and set-up makes Umai a decent option for a special night out instead. I like Umai enough that I know there will be another visit, eventually. But I admittedly wouldn't complain if the restaurant team took another look at the menu and made sure everything is being cooked as advertised in the meantime; heck, a spice scale in general probably wouldn't be a terrible idea, given the number of Thai dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for sushi in the South Hills. Nice variety of standard and special rolls, as well as chef specials that change weekly. I've eaten in the restaurant multiple times, as well as ordered take out and the quality of food is always the same. The wait staff is friendly and courteous, and suggest the best wines!"}
{"text":"Umai is located on the adorable Beverly Rd in Mt.Lebanon. I grew up just around the corner and never been to it! We were looking for some place different and close to a friends house last night and decided on Umai! We called about an hour ahead of time and they reserved a table for us so we got seated right away. 

The atmosphere inside is smaller, and has a very unique aesthetic. We were seated in the back in a booth that was very private and intimate. Our waiter was very sweet and attentive. 

I ordered the Thai margarita for my cocktail it was good but very strong! My friend also got the Prickley Pair cocktail that was lighter and more refreshing. Both boys got beers. We started with edamame and crab rangoon as appetizers. We all agreed these were the best crab rangoons we ever had! They were super creamy and light! 

Chris and I shared a sushi roll and a noodle bowl for our entree. We ordered the toto roll which was one of their speciality rolls. It had salmon, tuna, and tempura shrimp- soooo good!!! I love spicy sushi typically so I ordered a side of the spicy mayo to add to my roll, which I recommend! Chris isn't a fan of sushi and he even loved this! The other couple shared a spicy tuna roll and were raving about it as well! The noodle bowl we ordered was the drunken ramen noodles with chicken. This was pretty good but it was way too salty for my liking. Our friends also tried the pad Thai, this was very different from any I've had before. Next time I visit Umai, I think I will stick to the crab rangoons & sushi."}
{"text":"I was somewhat dismayed to find that this restaurant is so good, given it is within walking distance of my home and I had ignored it for so long! I have eaten here multiple times now and can say that the service is good, the red curry is fabulous, and the Pad Thai is tasty. The bartender is talented and attentive, and has come to our table on several occasions to inquire about our preferences and to see if our drinks were to our liking. The prices are not outrageous (contrary to other reviews) either. It's really a nice little place with good food and good service."}
{"text":"Excited for good sushi in South Hills!  Have eaten at Little Tokyo for years out of convenience, but this is so much better...downtown better.

Very fresh, very creative, very welcoming.  The Thai Margarita was one on the best cocktails ever.  The Hamachi Carpaccio was a superb medley of flavors beautifully presented.  Mussels in curry and Beverly st roll were amazing.

They could improve on the pace of service and knowledge of menu which will come with time...well worth it in meantime."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Sushi was not what i expected when it said \"lump crab meat\", it was a really mayo heavy crab salad. Also got Thai style fried rice, it was gummy and overcooked. Pretty flavorless and did not come with the side of cucumber it stated. Not terrible, it's just cucumbers. But all in all.. really disappointed because I heard great things. Might try eating in house to give another shot."}
{"text":"When we walked in, there were 2 two seat tables open. We stood in the front waiting while being assured by multiple staff that someone would be right with us. After probably at least ten minutes, a waitress came up and told us \"to come back in 15 minutes and they would have slowed down.\" Didn't take our name or anything. When we finally were seated, our waitress was very nice, but to be honest, completely awful. Everything was slow to come out, she hardly ever checked on us, and literally forgot about three different things we had ordered. Unfortunately, it wasn't just our service that was awful. This location is so small, you are basically sitting directly next to other couples(which isn't something I typically mind) We heard the couples on either side of us both complain about the length of their wait and lack of service. I will say, when the food finally did come out, it was absolutely spectacular. All except for the grilled calamari skewer, which came out completely raw and cold. (This was one of the items our waitress forgot about and basically brought out as we were getting our check). They gave us a free appetizer, which was nice but didn't quite make up for the extreme lack of service. The stars I gave were based on the food. If I were to rate solely on service, it would get no stars at all. 

If you don't mind terrible service, the food here is outstanding. So much so that it's almost worth the lack of service. 


Fresh food, beautifully presented, good drinks- horrific service"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here last Friday during their happy hour for some drinks and appetizers. The happy hour specials were pretty good with discounts on beer, house wine, and select cocktails. I really enjoyed the yellow tail and snapper sashimi. It was full of flavor and tasted very fresh. We also had their crab rangoons and seafood gyoza which I thought were delicious and not too salty like some other places make them. The service and staff were very happy. My fiancé wanted to order this one pina colada like drink and the bartender came over and explained how their version is different and how he recommended another drink. I was skeptical and thought he was just trying to push this other drink on us but it turned out to be a great choice and my fiancé loved it."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Pittsburgh.

Stopped by today for the first time for lunch with my sons.  Started with the crab Rangoon and vegetable  tempura.  Crab was okay, but the tempura was excellent - especially liked the asparagus and pumpkin.

We ordered a ramen dish and two sushi combos.  The sushi was done perfectly with very good quality fish.  The eel was especially good.

Service and atmosphere are as good as the food.

I've eaten sushi in Tokyo, Seattle, Vancouver, Chicago and Umai is at that level.  Granted you can find interesting versions in Tokyo, but there is no difference in quality or preparation."}
{"text":"New restaurant--has some wrinkles to work out.  Hostess seemed surprised to see a customer as we entered and shouted from the far end of the bar, rather than coming to the door to greet us.  Salmon wasn't very tasty, ramen was ok but could have been more flavorful.  Sushi chef was a bit unprofessionally dressed--not tidy, shirt didn't look clean.  Waitress was not very attentive, although there were only 2 other tables occupied."}
{"text":"We went there with our two rambunctious kids.  They were great with our kids and it was a nice dinner. The service was great and the food was too!  My hubby got the green curry which he loved and I got the drunken noodles.  Both were fantastic.  We will come back again as it was a nice atmosphere and great food.  We loved it.  We went to clean up after our kids and they said don't worry about it, which we appreciate and we always do our best to clean up after our kids.  A wonderful place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here for the first time for Valentine's Day and it was amazing. We had sushi, the duck curry, and also the udon noodle Thai dish. So yummy! They also sell homemade soap, which I will be returning to buy more of because my hands have never been so soft! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Food was good. The fish tasted fresh. I ordered the Toto Roll, miso soup, and edamame, and was not disappointed. The staff was very polite; however, I give this place 4 stars only because we were the only customers in the whole place and I still had to ask for our drinks to be refilled."}
{"text":"Pretty standard sushi fare at Mount Lebanon prices. 

The Poke was tasty but should be served over rice and was just a small bowl for $10. 

The seaweed salad you can get anywhere, same with the kobacha roll.

It was a nice day (78° in Pittsburgh in February) and I wanted to sit outside, so that was nice."}
{"text":"Very good. We came here on a Thursday before closing. Staff was nice and knowledgeable. We ordered the pot stickers, spicy tuna roll, orange chicken, and drunken ramen noodles. Everything came out hot and fresh. The chicken was juicy and not too much orange flavor. The spicy level for the drunken noodles was to my taste as well. We will be going back. It is a little pricy for what you get but we also used a groupon."}
{"text":"I just picked up a few basic rolls. First time since they reopened. Really outstanding. Great flavor and exceptionally fresh. Next time I'll stay for dinner. They made a very good first impression."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience here today. Our sushi rolls took nearly 40 minutes to come out - and we ordered sashimi. On top of this, there was an odd live musical performance of a young man playing the acoustic guitar, which seemed ill fitting for an Asian restaurant. Overall the food was above average, but the atmosphere was lacking. However, I have previously had a good experience here, so I will give Umai one more chance before discounting them completely."}
{"text":"Looking for a good bowl of ramen while in town on business.   I ordered some fatty tuna sashimi (very good), and a bowl of the Pork Ramen. The ramen was very good. Not the best I have had, but certainly satisfying. 

God service from my server as well. I will likely return the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I've only been here one time an I'll definitely be coming back. The atmosphere and the food preparation was great. I had a taste for sushi, and I wasn't disappointed. The service and their greeting was what  you expect in a restaurant. Can't wait to try the many selections that they have on their menu. Everything was presented in an eye-catching and pleasing manner in which you would wish that you could just stay and eat every dish on the menu. I'll be back.
I have been back several times, and I have never been disappointed. When I think of having some delicious sushi ,I  come back to this restaurant. I think I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Beverly Road strip.   Sushi was fresh and generous.  I had a ramen noodle bowl (which I loved) and tasted the teriyaki chicken.  Friends have raved about the oysters.  We were there on the first day they opened and things were a little disorganized, but that will likely get worked out with experience.

---------------

Went back and based on the most recent review (complaining about slow service) I timed my food.  9 minutes from completing my order until my appetizer came, then as we finished the last oyster, our server arrived with our dinners.  IF I were to complain about anything it was too fast.  But I'm not complaining.  

Meals were just as good as the first trip."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice.  The first time, the food was okay but not great.  The second time was worse.  I ordered the dumplings.  The size of the dumplings are small and are round shaped.  The dough was partially missing and broken up.  I have had far better dumplings.  I also ordered the miso ramen.  The broth was very oily and there was 4 thin slices of pork loin.  The pork was dry and leathery.  I requested no nori and that was prepared correctly.  The ramen were very chewy and disappointing.  The ramen base also had LOTS of corn kernels in it, which I was not expecting.  Nor was I expecting so many sesame seeds.  There were at least two spoonfuls in the ramen plus a spoonful in the broth."}
{"text":"The first time we went here they were pretty busy so the service was slow. The server was very apologetic and we were not in a hurry so we didn't mind. We got an avocado roll and it was good. We both ordered drunken noodles. It was the first time we had ever had this dish and it was amazing. It was so spicy and saucy and we both ate all of it and kept talking about how amazing it was. We actually talked about it for months before we made it back. We returned and ordered the drunken noodles and this time added broccoli and asked for extra sauce.
The dish came out and the noodles were different. They actually didn't have any sauce on them and they were not spicy. (They were also missing the napa, bean sprouts and basil but we didn't notice this until we got home and looked at the menu online. We were so fixated on the lack of sauce.) It was so bland and blah. We decided to ask the server if perhaps we got the wrong dish. He went and talked to the chef and returned to tell us the chef forgot to add the black soy sauce and offered to take it back and add it. He took mine back and it came back with soy sauce on it but it wasn't much better. Disappointed! The manager came over and told us they had a new chef and that he makes the recipe different. Instead of being a saucy delicious noodle it was like mall food court chow mein. Blah 
They removed one of the dishes off the bill which was a nice gesture. 
The sushi was good but not any better then any other spots. We might return but would never order the drunken noodles again."}
{"text":"I came just 20 minutes before the closing time.  Get to try new special pork belly sushi.  Not typical sushi that you would see in the \"American sushi joint\" but it's a great new dish. Well seasoned, and just enough for you to crave for more.  I had house soup made out of clear noodles, salmon sushi, hamachi sushi, spring roll and glass of wine.  Everything was good and fast.  Could be that I was coming at the end of the shift.  They didn't even tried to clear out the table to rush me out.  

I had worked in the real Japanese run sushi place, I would have to say this place is very close to authentic as it can be.   The food from the kitchen in the typical Japanese is usually takes a lot longer than sushi, because most Japanese eat sushi first then kitchen food.  Which I understand why they were a bit slow than other Asian food. 

I'm considered myself an Asian food snob and this place has met my expectation for Sushi

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday evening. Sat down at the bar for a good 10 minutes until we were even approached. A table had walked in 5 minutes after us and received immediate service. Finally the server came over after he had been refilling drinks for tables directly in front of us and said, \" oh did you just come in I didn't even see you\".... we should have just left after that. Instead we decided to order food. My friends food came out before mine and she even finished hers before mine came. When my food came it was not even what I ordered and the roll completely fell apart. Very bad experience."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place. Service was super attentive. We went on a Friday evening and were seated promptly. I had ramen with chicken and it was so delicious, so much flavor. We also shared a sushi roll which was very good. I would definitely return, we really enjoyed our experience here."}
{"text":"I am not to 5 stars yet, but this place has a lot of potential and I will definitely go back.  I am a huge fan of Massaman Curry and the full flavor of my order was awesome.  Big Negative for me -  Potatoes in the curry were not cooked.  If they get that part right - Five Stars it will be for the curry!  Hope to have it right next time."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the sushi! Completely fell apart. It tasted like BBQ sauce on top of the specialty roll and the other roll had zero flavor at all. Won't be back for sushi with so many other great places in the area."}
{"text":"The happy hour here is incredible! My boyfriend got the steamed salmon collar for dinner last night, while I got sushi. The sushi was so fresh and rich, with really beautiful presentation. The steamed fish was buttery and sweet. Our only complaint was that we couldn't eat more!"}
{"text":"Hamachi carpaccio is the bomb. Lots of options if you prefer sashimi to rolls. Very reasonably priced oysters during happy hour."}
{"text":"Sushi and Thai food are a wonderful combination and a great choice for a Saturday evening dinner. My boyfriend and I were celebrating our 1-year anniversary this past weekend, and we decided to stop at Umai for dinner following a Christmas play we attended.

I was pleased to see we were right in time for the late night $7 cocktails that were available from 8:30-10PM, and we ordered a glass of water and a \"drunken ginger\" to sip on. The bartender was supposedly doing double duty and was on a delivery at the time we placed our drink orders, so it took an extra couple minutes to get our drinks. 

We each got a sushi roll to go with our entrees, and anyone that knows me knows I love my sushi. My choice was tough as all of the pictures of the rolls looked great, but the prices were not so great. Umai's sushi rolls are 6 pieces for the basic rolls and 8 for the more intricate ones. My boyfriend got a salmon and avocado roll, and I got the Geisha roll (spicy tuna and asparagus wrapped in salmon with sauce, scallions, and fish eggs on top). I was very pleased with the presentation of my roll, but for $15 I was a little underwhelmed. The fish was indeed fresh, but out of all of the sushi joints in Pittsburgh I've been to, this was one of the more expensive ones.   

Recently I've become a big fan of Thai food, and there's something comforting about a heaping bowl of noodles with lots of veggies and a good protein. My boyfriend got green curry, which was rather thin and a bit underwhelming, but we both loved the flavors (and portion size) of my Pad Thai. I'm planning on trying another one of their noodle dishes next time in the hopes that they are as good as what I experienced this past visit. Overall I'm impressed with the quality of food here, and we'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Beverly Rd! Tuna tataki was incredible; ponzu sauce had a nice little kick to it. Orange chicken looked good and it was huge. My husband really enjoyed it. I had pad Thai and liked it a lot. My friend tasted mine and she loves pad Thai and she said it was really, really good. Pork ramen was kick ass. Beer selection was fairly extensive for a small restaurant. It was impressive. I offered my husband a taste of my seaweed salad and he hobbled it up so that was great. The music was hip and cool so I loved that about it. The people working there are so nice, too. We are there on a Wednesday and we're back for more on Saturday. Loved it."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this sushi experience. The server was very nice and attentive to our table. The Salmon Gravlax was something I've never tried, or even heard of, so I decided to go for it. The tastes from the different flavors was amazing! I recommend this, maybe as a app to share (it reminded me of a bruschetta). I also ordered the spicy salmon roll. It was also very tasty! It is very hard to find a sushi bar that serves good quality and tasteful sea food. I have come across very few here that do. So I do recommend this place to those that want a nice little dinner out, especially someone who is a first timer! 
Many items on the menu are different then the traditional sushi restaurants, so maybe look through the menu before hand so your not so overwhelmed! It is also a tad pricier too. But worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Another great addition to Mt Lebanon's vibrant restaurant scene. Friendly and attentive wait staff provide a creative mash up menu of Thai and Japanese cuisine. Sushi is freshly prepared and the noodle bowls are made with an attention to detail rarely scene in Pittsburgh. I've dined here three times and had drinks and apps once. Looking forward to future visits and bringing more friends."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Umai. I've eaten there several times, I've dined in but mainly get take out. The food is always consistent. All the sushi is good and the tom yum noodle bowl is also a favorite. The menu has plenty of options other than sushi. I def  recommend giving it a try! The service has always been great too."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a terrific trip to Umai for our Friday date night. The restaurant is situated among the more American-style restaurants on Beverly, so the Asian-influenced cuisine is a welcome break from pizza and sandwiches. The menu had a great selection of oysters, sushi, and Thai cuisine, as well as a variety of beer, wine, sake, and cocktails for happy hour! We were very happy with the service as well - however some other tables near us expressed frustration over the wait for their food. Perhaps an extra server will be needed in the future on a Friday night. However we will be happy to return anytime!"}
{"text":"I've tried Umai twice now, and it's just not that great. The first time we ate in, ordered a massive amount of sushi to share. And yup, it was....ok. The fish was fresh, but there was just something missing. The 2nd time was tonight. I was craving the sush but didn't want to venture out in 10 degree weather so ordered delivery. The shrimp tempura roll was ok, (it's fried so how bad could it be) except it was missing the crab, cucumber & avocado that was listed in the menu description- just shrimp & rice. The California roll was strange, it tasted like there were green peppers in it? Idk but it was overpowering & weird. The Thai Tom Noodles were incredibly bland. I'll stick with Little Tokyo."}
{"text":"I came with my husband for his birthday. I was excited to see my favorite wine (moscato) on the menu and he was excited to find a decent selection of sushi. 

My husband got the main lobster sushi roll and a spicy tuna roll. He also got the miso soup. The main lobster roll was interesting - had all of the sandwich fixing like lettuce, tomato and lobster. Not sure he'd get it again. The spicy tuna roll had good beefy tuna and got a big thumbs up. Miso was enjoyable. 

I got the yaki soba noodle dish and added chicken. It was really delicious and the presentation was beautiful. Almost looked like it was breathing or pulsing. Super cool! 

Service was great. Restaurant itself is small and cozy. Interior was nicely decorated and everything looked very clean. Music was enjoyable. 

We would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Where can I start?! This is by far the best sushi place I've been to in PA.

THE ROLLS:
-So my doctor says I can't have imitation crab as a prego lady so I've been challenged with trying to find an amazing totally cooked sushi rolls. This is a huge challenge for me considering I could probably be happy eating a fish right out of the ocean. Sashimi, nigiri, and raw rolls are the life source just beyond my reach the next 9 months, boo. I promise that I am not rambling there is a moral to this story. 
-TL;DR...Traditionally when you order a California Roll you have to request an upgrade to snow crab or real crab that usually comes with a multi dollar up-charge. At UMAI, the California roll already comes with real crab, so the sushi is delicious and NO UPCHARGE YAY! 
- For the not so fond of seafood folks, my coworker ordered the pumpkin roll which was served fresh and still slightly warm which actually made the roll delicious!

OTHER FOODS:
-Miso Soup: Miso is miso but they are not stingy on the tofu which is a big bonus.
-Side Salad: The dressing was nice and creamy with a little tang. 
-Gyoza: It's hard to get gyoza wrong and UMAI was not one to disappoint. Great flavor!
-Edamame: Served with a grilled onion topping. I love traditional but this is so delicious I would order it again.
-Veggie Tempura: The batter was crispy and not over breaded, the sauce was perfect, and along with traditional vegetables there was pumpkin, asparagus, and mushrooms. YUM!
-Shoyu Ramen: I am a Tonkotsu Ramen girl so the Shoyu didn't hit home like I wanted but it was still delicious. If you like different kinds of ramen then I suggest trying this! 
 
SERVICE: 
- Our waitress Valerie was top notch! The sushi bar can out as it was made and she didn't miss a beat. She was super sweet and attentive. 

AMBIANCE:
- It's a small intimate place so make sure you go during a non-rush time to really get an untainted opinion before you try to tough the lunch rush. The owner was working the sushi bar which added a warm touch to the place. I love family owned establishments. 

PARKING:
- There is meter parking in the front and sides of the strip but if you can't find a spot, try the larger meter parking lot behind the building. I had to park at the farthest spot of that lot and it was not too far to walk in my heels."}
{"text":"The place is good. Very clean and has actual real plants. We ordered maki rolls, Pad ka prao and Thai tomyum noodles which were all really good. The fried calamari, however was not good at all. The batter was too thin, resulting in it being oily and rubbery. The rest is all good and service is good. Decent prices."}
{"text":"Love love Umai! The chefs are so friendly and if you sit at the bar (excellent happy hour!) they sometimes treat you to a tasting.  Very fresh ingredients and a very inventive menu!"}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for lunch 
After an hour told they did not have what I ordered.  They offered an alternative but it was not even edible.  So they took it off my bill but still no lunch - back to work still hungry .  Everyone was very nice especially the waitress .  Want all business to be flourishing but they need to reevaluate their practices ."}
{"text":"Perhaps my rating would be higher if I was not a vegetarian, but unfortunately, UMAI's target customer is not a veghead like me. It was a challenge to find anything that did not contain fish sauce - literally everything from their soups to noodle dishes - so beware my fellow vegetarians!

For my appetizer (which is FREE if you check in on Facebook), I had the vegetable robatayaki  (without their fish tainted sauce). Not something I would recommend. I also ordered their veggie roll which was average quality. Not much you can say about vegetables wrapped in rice.

The only entrees that could be made vegetarian are the curries, so that was my choice by default. I went with the green curry with tofu as recommended by the waitress (who was phenomenal, by the way). My mouth was on FIRE guys! I am the absolute worst when it comes to spicy foods, so I let the waitress know that they need to tone it down a little - okay, maybe a lot. Their only solution was to water it down with coconut milk which just made it flavorless yet somehow still burning hot - the complete opposite of what I was going for. Go figure. 

I am obsessed with green tea flavored anything, so I was beyond excited when it came time for dessert. They ran out of the green tea ice cream but I was able to snag some green tea cheesecake which, to my dismay, tasted nothing like green tea. It was still delicious because, well, it's cheesecake. 

As a vegetarian, UMAI disappointed, however, their non-vegetarian dishes looked amazing from what I saw so although I won't be returning, I would say it's still worth a visit to try for yourself!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good sushi in the south hills, Umai is the place to go. They also have some really great noodle dishes. Good restaurants in the area are hard to come by, so I have been here every other week since they opened. All the friends I bring with me are always impressed too! I'm hoping they will put Bento boxes or meal combos on their menu (like they do at lunch), as at the end I'm still a bit hungry when ordering sushi, but it's great food and great service!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a few times and had decent meals. The last time we got delivery. We ordered online which was easy and our food arrived prior to the promised time. We also received some spring rolls that we didn't order that were phenomenal. Not sure if that was a mistake or if we were supposed to get them for some reason. I've had the green curry before and it was always good. The time of delivery it seemed to be lacking coconut flavor and was watered down. I would probably order it again but only at Umai, not for delivery. We also got massaman curry with duck which was also pretty good."}
