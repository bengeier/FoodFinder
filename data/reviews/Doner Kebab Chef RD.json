{"text":"Have heard about Doner for a while. Now I know what they were talking about. Awesome. The people working there couldn't have been more nice. Will be back"}
{"text":"The real thing, and there really is no substitute for a Doner sandwich. If you got hooked on these in Germany or somewhere else in Europe, here you go. 

The lamb kebab is also great, and incredibly tender.

Also it's a very friendly, family-run operation. If only they were open til 2-3AM.."}
{"text":"Best restaurant at the mall! The food is healthy and tasty, and owners really care about the food they make you. I always get the tortilla gyro but have tried the plates which remind me of expensive Mediterranean food I've bought in the past. It's so affordable and any mall shopper should give it a chance!"}
{"text":"I had the gyro with lamb. Awesome food. Nice family working there. Will definitely go back again soon"}
{"text":"Good authentic food. In a food court and Keebab will take 10 mins but totally worth it"}
{"text":"Great doner kebab! Like other reviews have said, tastes just like what you'd find in Germany. The pocket bread is specially ordered and doesn't fall apart. Can't believe this place is in a mall food court - so good!"}
{"text":"Finally! Authentic döner. Very close to the ones I ate in Germany. They have lamb but also other meat options. This is our new go to place when we are craving Döner!!!"}
{"text":"Love the #9 option...it has 6 chicken wings pita bread rice salad yogurt sauce.i 2 year old alone eats 4 wings and rice. She loves it. They prepare on the spot it takes 10 mins but its worth waiting for.chef and his wife both are very courteous. Definately recommend ."}
{"text":"Döner pocket is tasty. I recommend it. Well thought out. The bread it came with is specially made for the dish."}
{"text":"Favorite place at PV mall. The owners are Turkish. And they have different varieties of veggies for your food. They are polite and professional. The meat was cooked good! I'm really picky with the salt in the meat and it was seasoned right!"}
{"text":"I have been to Doner Kebab 4 times now, since it opened a month ago. Yesterday I had the Adana kebab. It was very nicely spiced. The owners are from Adana, Turkey so they really know how to make this dish.

There is a lot of food on the Adana Kebab plate. Great fresh salad, grains (looks like cous cous), pita bread, a side of Yogurt/Cucumber sauce (tzatziki/jajik) and grilled tomato and grilled green pepper. So delicious! 

I love that there is now a Turkish kebab shop near my home! PS The baklava was absolutely some of the best baklava I have ever tasted. They sell it four pieces at a time, which is wise since you can't eat just one."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch after reading some others reviews. The #6 combo with a drink was reasonably priced, and very fresh. The owner was very personable, dishing out my order himself. The meal itself was very delicious, the pita was very fresh, and the portion was just right. I will definitely return, and will tell my friends!

{"text":"Love the #9 good portion, love that they make it on the spot . The owner are friendly  and courtesy.  Go try it out it worth it"}
{"text":"There are not many Doener places in Arizona and I a so happy to have this one at the PV mall. The food is so good and this Turkish  family owned business deserve all the customers they can get. If you like Mediterranean food and kebabs in particular, then this is the place for you. Also try the Baklava, a sweet treat that is very sweet and not cheap, but worth trying."}
{"text":"I did the fries and lamb doner. It was great! The sauces really stood out. Make sure to get a lot of the white ( taziki style) sauce. And get some hot sauce on the side.

I'm not sure if they make the doner meat in-house. But it was as good as any other gyro style meat out there.

Friendly service. Hard working, family run."}
{"text":"Went to Doner Kebab today for lunch - they're in the food court at the PV Mall - I think they took over the space formerly occupied by the short-lived Korean BBQ place.

The Gyro was typical - the meat was a bit dry at first (I think the spit had been sitting for a while before it was sliced off and it cooked a bit long).  Tasted good - like a gyro - which is what I was looking for.

My friend got the Doner Kebab - he said the rice was good, and that the lamb was ok."}
{"text":"This kebab doesn't lack all the additions like most Gyro places, it really makes the difference when you get a good mixture of marinated onions, tomatoes and cucumber along with lettuce, tiziki sauce, chili sauce and the awesome fresh cooked bread that you get as an option instead of just pita."}
{"text":"Great place. A real gem hidden in the food court at PV Mall. I've eaten here many times and usually get the number #6, which is basically just a box of lamb and fries. It's by far the best deal, and you definitely get your money's worth of food. The owner is very friendly and takes a lot of pride in his food. It's great to see the role small businesses are playing in keeping the mall from dying out after many crappy chain stores have bailed."}
{"text":"Owner is always very kind and courteous. I get number #2 which is the Lamb wrap. Much larger than anywhere else at a reasonable price and it is very good."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see a doner kebab restaurant open up at PV mall. Having tried the famous German Doner Kebab chain in Dubai when they first opened, I was excited to try this place too. We browsed through the menu options and decided to go for sandwiches rather than plates. I chose the doner kebab in pita and my husband went for the sandwich. The meat was tender and tasted good. It was a little on the over seasoned side for me but it wasn't too overwhelming to the point where I couldn't eat. Good size sandwich but for me, that wasn't big enough. I am a small person but when I'm hungry, I can eat! And although I had some fries with my meal, I wasn't completely full. Prices are average. My husband and I paid around $23 for 2 drinks, 2 sandwiches and one order of fries. I have to warn you, the pita option can get very messy because it's a pocketless pita. I would go with the pocket sandwich next time. My husband looked much nicer eating his meal than I did! 

Overall good quality and will be happy to have it again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The food is fresh and made to order. We had the Adana Lamb Kebab and Doner Sandwich and it was so good! Highly recommend trying this restaurant. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place deserves to be in a better place then this lousy mall if you're looking for excellent well prepared food then you're at the right place! The owner is the cook and he works there alone he takes this time preparing the meal to perfection he really knows what he's doing excellent I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I had a Doner Sandwich for the 1st time last night. It was really good on fresh European bread with no preservatives. The owner is very friendly and really cares about his customers and the quality of his food."}
{"text":"So good! I had the pocket bread lamb sandwich I think #4. That bread was so good, warm and crispy outside and inside soft but not mushy or doughy. Stuffed with tons of the most delicious lamb, thin slices and so tender. The yogurt dressing was good, light and herb flavors and just enough that didn't drown the sandwich. Filled with lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber all very fresh. Inexpensive fresh meal. I will be back."}
{"text":"We'd been searching for a good donee kebab place and it looks like we found it. The Turkish bread, the lamb, the chicken... I was all good, and we will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I usually stop here on the way to my twice-a-month networking meeting. He can put any of the sandwiches on to a salad which is great. They go the little extra mile and make things exactly the way you want them. The food is always delicious and I'm always satisfied."}
{"text":"I ate at Döner Kebap a few days ago. The food was amazing! It was like a true homemade Turkish meal. I ordered chicken sis kebap with bulgur (cracked wheat) which was cooked with onions and tomatoes. Yum! My friend also ordered Adana Kebap. I would recommend Adana Kebap if you haven't tried it. It was restaurant quality food served at food court. This restaurant definitely deserves being in a better location."}
{"text":"**Please support PV mall businesses**

Hubby likes the food from here a lot and the service is always friendly.
We always end up getting the same stuff, I would like to make an effort to try different stuff from the menu. I will let you know how that goes.

He gets a gyro wrap (doner I think they call it), and I get a gyro plate with no pita bread.

The portions are very generous and the food is very tasty and fresh.

Remember that PV mall food court is a great place to visit with the family because every one can get whatever they want, they have multiple options like pizza, Chinese food, Mexican food, kebabs, etc.
I used to get the pho next door but sadly they recently closed.

Now for dinner and a movie it is usually Picture Show and Doner Kebab.
: )"}
{"text":"I read the reviews yesterday, so I thought we would try it out.
As everyone else has said, this is absolutely the best doner in the Valley.
The doner sandwich took me back to Germany as well.  It was delicious without being extra greasy.  Great portion size.. could only eat one.   
I would come here again and again and again..."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place. Finally a decent Döner! If you're missing the Turkish Döner the way it's served in Germany, check this place out.

I have been searching in vain for Döner in every state I visit, looking for a sandwich close to the kind I grew up with in Germany. (Yes, people think it's silly that I want a Turkish sandwich, but I want it they way it's served in Germany...but if you've ever had it, then you know why.) I didn't even know this joint existed, but I happened to stop at the PV Mall and pass through the food court. Thought I was seeing things when I saw the \"Döner Kebab\" sign. My head did an involuntary swivel back to double-check. Like, what?!?! Even though I'd already eaten lunch earlier, I walked right up, saw they had the fluffy Turkish bread option for the lamb Döner, and ordered it. Oh, it was so good. Was it 100% the \"German Turkish Döner\" of my childhood? No, but it had all the elements and was like 90% there. The bread and the tzatziki were right on. The meat was the only thing that took it down a teeny tiny notch. It was cooked on the vertical broilers (which is great), but seemed more like the formed and pressed loaf of seasoned meat you find at many gyro places, rather than actual thin, marinated slices of lamb threaded on to the broiler skewer. It was still very tasty though, as it was well seasoned and had the nice browned bits from being broiled. The taste was close enough anyway. I closed my eyes and I was back in Germany, eating a standing table on a cobblestone walkway in front of our local Döner stand. Mmm. Coming back down to earth, I acknowledge that, yes, it's just a sandwich, so I don't want to oversell it, but it's THE sandwich to me. Heretofore, it was like the white whale of sandwiches! Lol. Now I don't need a plane ticket to Europe when I crave it.

It's in the PV Mall food court, so you're not there for ambiance. It's counter service. The people were very nice. Their menu offered variety of grilled meat in either sandwich form or as combo plates. 

Worth a visit. Do check it out. I will definitely return for that Döner even though I live across the Valley."}
{"text":"Best gyro I've ever tried. Very authentic and very fresh. The couple that owns the restaurant is so sweet!Definitely worth the trip to get a good quality gyro."}
{"text":"Pita wrap was very good and fresh. The yogurt sauce is light and not spicy. Price affordable. Go"}
{"text":"My husband loved it!  The service was awesome and so was the food.  We both love the opportunity to support a new family owned business.  If you are looking for some good Turkish food close to home, this is the place to go!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"For the moms out there like me that end up wandering into the PV Mall Food Court after the play place this place is seriously good. I haven't had a Doner Kebab in forever and while my kids wanted Paradise Bakery I had to try it out. It was so tender and delicious and the fellow who runs it could not be nicer. If you love Doner Kebab this is the best I've had in quite some time."}
{"text":"Doesn't taste good and quantity is less. Little pricey , no fries with Pita. Try Greek wraps, so much better."}
{"text":"BOOM! Dropping a big \"5 Star\" on Doner Kebab! This the BEST doner (gyro) kebab I have ever had, others are good but this one is the best. You can even watch them carve off your doner kebab as you drool. The seasoned fresh veggies make this a delectable treat for the taste buds. I will return (and I have) and I do recommend trying this place. Try the Doner Sandwich!"}
{"text":"This is the most legitimate doner I have ever had. The only thing that came close was when I was in Germany and had it for the first time ever. You know its real when you can the doner turning on the rotisserie, and you are being served by the guy from Turkey where it originated. I had the tortilla gyro, and the tomato relish was an incredible compliment to the flavorful meat. I am so glad we finally tried this place, because my husband and I know where we are coming for dinner from now on! Please don't wait until you are shopping in PV mall to eat here."}
{"text":"I have not been to PV Mall in years but based on previous reviews of this place I decided to stop in for lunch. The quality of food and service is phenomenal. I enjoyed the Doner sandwich with lamb very much. The meat is first grade quality and so are all the other ingredients used. To boot this is a family business run by a husband and wife, very authentic and very tasty! I highly recommend stopping in and giving it a try"}
{"text":"5 stars hands down. Very similar to the ones that are popular in Germany. Get the number 4 with lamb or chicken and hot sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Wow great food and big serving. I was hungry so I ordered a Doner box too, but had to drag it home for a snack. My party had a Doner sandwich, Doner kebab chicken and a Mediterranean chicken salad. We loved them all 5 star way better than I expected a the mall."}
{"text":"Delicious gyro Turkish sandwich and generous portions for the price. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Nondescript, incredibly unassuming, hidden away in one of the least glamorous malls in the greater Phoenix area is one of my favorite new places to grab something quick.

The kebab chicken is fantastic and flavorful, as are the lamb and gyro. Try as you might, it's really hard to go wrong. My go to is the Mediterranean chicken salad, with everything. When the owner asks you if you want something, you say yes. It's the right choice. 

The family that owns and runs the place is always on site and really helpful. They don't judge when I ask for double chicken, and graciously support my affinity/addiction to their hot sauce (applied generously to everything). 

I'm blown away that I never have to wait in line. Honestly, I don't ever write reviews, I just want to help Doner however I'm able. Granted, I'm legitimately into this place, and you will be, too."}
{"text":"Such a surprise find in PV Mall!  I devoured the Lamb Sandwich in a fresh crispy Turkish Bread Picket.  Mmm. Filled with savory lamb and crunchy veggies. Felt like I was on a foodie vacay in a Food Court!"}
{"text":"Best gyros in town! A very unassuming place with great food. I don't why more people don't go here. The meat is good quality and service is excellent. Best choice mall meal hands down! Get the gyro wrapped in tortilla for a quick tasty to go meal. The owner is so nice, he makes your meal and will pile it high to your satisfaction. I am so completely over places measuring out amounts. Doner focuses in making the food well and to your liking. I love this place. Why people go to paradise bakery or panda express at the mall is beyond me. Live a little, expand your tastes, try a meal here and wake up your taste buds!"}
