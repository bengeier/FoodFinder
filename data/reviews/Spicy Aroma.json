{"text":"I have dined here three times now and the food is great, especially given the price point. Tried the goat for the first time and it was good! I recommend the butter and curry chicken -- it's not dry and flavourful. The rice is always fresh and the sides are delicious, like the chickpeas and mixed veggies. The garlic sauce is also a nice addition. If you're looking for a good and quick take home meal (portions are hearty) then I recommend this spot. Consider taking the food out because there isn't much room to sit (three, small, seated sections). The service is on point, kind and will offer recommendations or an explanation if you're not sure about what to choose. Just note that if you get a \"mix and match\" dish it'll be extra and they're willing to make substitutions or change dishes up to your liking, which may not be featured on the menu."}
{"text":"This place opened up about maybe two months ago? It's quickly become one of my favourite places for food in Toronto. The quantity-to-price ratio is amazing: a fully loaded veggie platter (rice, chickpeas in curry, lemon potatoes, lentils, saut√©ed vegetables (in some kind of sauce) AND a salad!) for $5.65 (that's tax included) - and it's all delicious. Their samosas are legitimately some of the best I've ever had (although I will concede one time I had them they weren't as good as normal - but because they were a different kind of samosa, not because they had been poorly made that day). And they also have some good Indian desserts/sweets. I am not affiliated with the restaurant in any way, but seeing as I live quite close, I thought it would be in my own best interest to make a Yelp! for them to get the word out because I'd hate for them to close. As a student on a budget, this place is really a dream come true."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and delightful service! Can't say enough great things about this place. I went there for the first time tonight and will surely return! This is one of those places where you feel your business is appreciated and you're expectations are exceeded. Thank you Spicy Aroma!"}
{"text":"I love falafel (one of my favourite foods) and I just so happened to pass by on my way home and decided to pick up a meal to go. The person prepping the food was so sweet. It was near closing and he took his time and asked me what vegetables I didn't like on my salad.   For the price it's crazy good because I'm so used to paying over $10 for a falafel plate (halal guys, villa madina, ali babas). -- I paid $5 for the same thing. Only thing is the rice I got was plain but it was still delicious!   I also got a serving of curried chick peas and I also love indian food so that was a plus!!  Will come back if near by"}
