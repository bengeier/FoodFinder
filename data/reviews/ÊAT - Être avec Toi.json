{"text":"Great seafood towers and fresh Schucked clams. Amazing clam chowder. Good burger too. Very cool space. Pricey."}
{"text":"I'm going for small seafood dishes here, coming from the appetizer or salad menu. Unfortunately, the waiting time for these simple & tasty dishes is way way over time. Such a shame and in my opinion, unnessesary. But... To top this dinner off, the freshly made churros are to die for !!! Paired with thick whipped cream this is an amazing combo. Do not miss out on the churros!"}
{"text":"Je me suis retrouvé là ce matin pour petit déjeuner au choix de mon hôte. On m'a servi une omelette à 19.00$  sèche et trop cuite. 15.00$ pour un bol de fruits sans façon et 6$ pour une tasse de café au lait. Résultat pour deux, 87.00$ pour déjeuner avant pourboire. Désolé, dans mon cas c'est adieu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Alas, they botched it in the most preventable ways.
First off... they seemed really put off at fact that I only speak english. I get it. It's Quebec. But you're a hotel restaurant catering to out of towners!!
Once seated I waited for 10 mins for anyone to serve me. Again, whatever. I'm dining alone on business, but starting to get fussy.
I had oysters to start. Good price, good oysters and well shucked. Good job.
Ordered octopus, fired and broccolini as my main. Waited 15 mins; no worries.
They brought the octopus, fries... and some broccoli. I mentioned this to bus boy, who cringed at being outed and said he would fetch server. Server actually tried to convince me that I was having 'baby broccoli'. No sir, I ain't no fool.
He came back in another 5 Mins, barked in French, and when seed to clarify advised that my entre would be comped. Good enough, I guess.... but I would be happy to just have another vegetable side. No luck. He skirts off not be seen until I finish my meal.

Tl; dr: good food, contemptuous service. Will never be back."}
{"text":"We heard about this new restaurant and were attracted to the beautiful artwork they display. It is worth a trip just to see the artwork alone-murals, paintings, brightly colored walls, great lighting and music. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. One of the owners introduced himself and checked in on repeatedly us throughout the night, and our waiter Gael worked tirelessly to keep us happy all evening. The menu also attracted us, lots of fresh seafood platters to share, great steaks and little ceramic ramekins filled with yummy side dishes, not to mention their amazing sauce list that you get to choose from. Little did we know, the head chef is from Nice, and trained at Michelin star restaurants in France. This became apparent as the evening progressed, each course deliciously prepared and served with style and flair, the sirloin steak was perfectly cooked as were the oysters, mussels, mashed potatoes, and sides of cauliflower, kale and other veggies. The chef came out to visit us as well several times and make sure we were happy with our meals. The portions were very generous and the chef sent extra oysters out for everyone to try as well as lobster on the house for us all to taste. Pure class, all the way. They are very attentive and accommodating to allergies as well, which we appreciated. Many little touches enhanced the experience, like sand filled timers that come with your tea leaves so you can make yourself a perfectly timed cup of tea, many dishes are assembled at the table which is also fun to watch and the desserts are over the top! You must try the brownie, banana, ice cream sundae, it is a piece of artwork, looks like a giant volcano, overflowing with chocolate and caramel lava, and adorned with caramelized nuts and home made meringue straws and meringue lava served on a giant glass platter (so big it took two waiters to carry it out!) We literally applauded when they brought it to us, and again the chef sent us extra portions so all six of us could try it... Drinks were great too! All in all, it was a five star night! Something to please everybody...Good job Etre Avec Toi!!! I think this would be a great place to host a 40th birthday party or a special event... We went on Christmas eve and it certainly was a magical night!"}
{"text":"J'ai mangé au ÊAT quelques fois, surtout pour les Oystermania (12 huîtres et 1 drink pour 10$ !!!) et aussi pour MTL à table l'an passé. Les huîtres ici ne sont pas mes préférées, car c'est évident qu'elles ont étés ouvertes à l'avance, alors elles sont \"sèches\". Au MTL à table, j'avais mangé le tartare de saumon (super) et la paella de fruits et de mers qui était ok, rien de spécial, mais mangeable. Les prix sont quand même chers pour ce que c'est donc je viens seulement lors des promos."}
{"text":"I've visited Ê.A.T. of the W Montreal Hotel for brunch. Upon arrival I was amazed by the decor and especially the wall art (psst art lovers you will enjoy this!), also, not sure if it's recurrent any other days of the week, but there was a very good DJ. The service was great, I ordered a macchiato,  a strawberry mimosa and the Banana Dream, which is made of waffles, chantilly, caramelized bananas and maple candied pecans. The way they serve their mimosa is very original and tasted very good. My only negative comment would go to the dish I ordered as for some reason the waffles were very dry which made them really hard to eat, I wouldn't have mind except when it's 20$ a plate I pay a bit more attention to details. However, I would recommend this place for the overall experience."}
{"text":"Yes whimsical, perhaps avant-garde as others have noted but far too casual for a formal restaurant without casual pricing. I ordered a tuna tartare and calamari, both were very good but the calamari came with one small set of squid legs, yes one that is all.  Overall not really the experience I was seeking and I needed to supplement with Lebanese take out before bed."}
{"text":"Hotel restaurants will have that \"chi chi\" appeal. Eat @ W is whimsical, fun, art in your face at every table and wall. We came in for brunch with a big group and sat at this really cool table of a graphic art version of Montreal's skyline.

Mimosa bar is fun, test tubes of mango, strawberry and blueberry and a bunch of us took turns taking photos. (Strawberry was my fav) The sweet brunch of waffles, carmelized bananas with chocolate sauce looked amazing (and also not too sweet) and the crepes offers a sweet and savory option. The omelets are standard fare. The most amazing thing I really enjoyed were the sides. Cauliflower! I loved the yogurt base and curry infused oil. Roasted and browned just right, everything comes alive. Go with the sides if the regular menu does not appeal to you, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Beyond impressed with the art work in this place, if you actually take a second to stop eating and look around you will notice modern pieces mixed with graffiti, awesome work done by local artists  

The place is spacious and the seating is super cool you have booths, high tables, round high table, tables for 2 that aren't high lol you catch my drift it's funky fresh.

Oyster mania is going on over here as well until April 30th you can grab oysters right there no need to print out the paper unless you want your glass of bubbly then by all means do it online.

Drinks range from 11-16 depending on what you want( wine= 11 , cocktails=16)

The food we tried was great the shrimp were coated perfectly and they nailed the sauce. The pork belly was good as well not really my thing but it looked so pretty had to give it a go. The butternut squash was great. Cake pops were excellent nothing like the ones you get at the store with that crappy icing and super dry inside."}
{"text":"Je vais être critique sur ce resto car je fais beaucoup de restos en ce moment et celui-là n'a pas été à la hauteur de mes attentes, malgré que ce soit un haut de gamme au centre ville.
Le service a été particulièrement long, il a fallu re-commander à une 2e personne car nous n'étions pas sûrs que la 1e ait pris notre commande, nous avons attendu 45mn nos huitres (ok nous étions 3, mais quand même, pour un mercredi soir ça n'aurait pas dû être si long), nous avons dû demander à plusieurs reprises de l'eau, du pain, la bouteille de vin que nous avions commandé 20mn + tôt..C'est sûr qu'idéalement, on voulait boire notre vin avec nos huîtres..
Nous sommes partis ailleurs après les huîtres car les plats offerts sur le menu étaient assez dispendieux, pour des choses assez banales.. et ça ne nous tentait pas d'attendre encore 1h pour la suite
Seuls points positifs: les bouteilles de vin sont abordables (à partir de 35$) et les serveuses sont quand même souriantes (sauf une qu'on avait l'air d'ennuyer à redemander de l'eau..)
Bref, nous n'y retournerons pas."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! 

I had already been once before during the Yelpoween party and knew I was in for a treat. The décor of the place is so artsy. You have all kinds of tags and artwork on the walls and I believe it's all from Montreal. The vibe is casual but you tell it's also a bit classier because of the service and food offered. Adam won a gift certificate with Yelp and so were able to go again.

I got an ice tea to start off and it was just a bit too lemony for my taste but Adam really enjoyed his beer. We initially came here for a happy hour after work but ended up getting food as well. 
The menu was so tempting! We got an entrée of calamari and it was delightful. Fluffy, creamy, and comforting. 

For our main meal we both went with the burger (we wanted to get different meals so we could try more but we both really wanted the burger :P) and it was HUGE. I got mine with a side of ceasar salad and Adam got fries. What's great about this place is they give you your ketchup and mayo in individual personal little bottles. They are still sealed so you know only you will use it.I also really appreciate that they bring you the mayo along with the Ketchup. I always have to ask other places for mayo, but here they bring it without asking.

The burger was good, the meat was juicy, tender, and well-seasoned. I found the bread really warm and airy. The dressing of bacon, cheese, and tomato was winner. Nothing too life changing but still good.  

Service is excellent. Our waiter, Simon, was great. He guided us when we wanted to pick our food, he made sure we had enough water and napkins often, he joked around with us, he was friendly yet professional. When we go to places like these, we sometimes get snubbed but not this time around (although this could be because were both in work clothes). It's really nice how they bring you your food on a trolley. It feels fancy and premium. 

I don't often go to restaurants like these so this was a really fun date night place. I would come back again for sure!

The food may not have been the best I've ever had but coupled with the service and overall experience we had, it's a five."}
{"text":"I went there for drinks for the second time. The first being in December which was about 5 months ago. The cocktails were terrific then but one I had really wanted to try they didn't have the components for at the time. I thought I'd give them another chance and bring someone whose birthday it was as well after I had raved about how great their cocktails were from before. This time literally half (and I actually mean 50%) of their drink menu could not be made because they were missing components to make it.  How can you function without being able to make half of your advertised drinks?  The manager said to mention this next time I was there but didn't offer to do anything while I was there now. So that of course means he has no intention of doing anything at the next time either as he also purposely didn't offer his name either. My advise is, if you'd like to be frustrated and play hit and miss with the waiter as to what they actually can make then try here. Otherwise I'd literally go just about anywhere else, as I really don't enjoy being jerked around."}
{"text":"Beautiful décor in the swanky W hotel; was invited there for an event yesterday after work. Was part of a group of 20 and got to sit in the area where there was a lot of graffiti on the walls. Really cool restaurant. 

Got a glass of Pinot Grigio for $10-11 and had some bites (delicious shrimp tempura with spicy mayo; butternut squash served with pistachio and a carrot cake pop). 

The music is quite loud so you have to talk loud to hear each other after 7pm. If staying in the hotel or in the area, you should definitely consider checking it out."}
{"text":"Wow, what a difference! I have been making about 10 week long trips a year to Montreal for the past 6 years and staying at the W for about the last 3. I ate at the previous restaurant occasionally, Italian, and it was good. They revamped and reopened about 2 months ago, moving to  French cuisine, seafood featured. 
I have eaten 2 dinners in the past week and have been really impressed. I had scallops the first time, lamb the second, and had the clam chowder both times. You have a choice of sides, I had a dirty rice with the scallops and cauliflower with the lamb. As you would expect with fine French, the sauces were rich and generous. The meats were done perfectly, maybe a bit rare for some but exactly as I prefer, and the sides plated at the table. Portions are surprisingly generous. 
Both times I may have enjoyed the sides as much as the meat. In fact, sides alone would be quite filling. I found both the rice and cauliflower very complex, with a blend of tastes and textures, that reminded me of better Indian dishes, but this was decidedly French in the sauces. There was a piquant crunch to my cauliflower that I learned was a mature caper. Not the little squishy ones you put on a bagel with cream cheese, but the big, olive sized adults. Simply outstanding.
The decor is fine, a bit trendy for me, service excellent despite my zero Quebecois, and I really enjoyed the eclectic background music (surprising myself).  
The food, though, is the thing. Not cheap, not outlandish, but really fine French with a complex blend. This area is getting much more sophisticated in food offerings and this new restaurant may lead the pack."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Amazing presentation, they serve everything on a cart brought to your table. Tried the lobster Benedict (really yummy hollandaise sauce) and the 5 ingredient omelette with nicely crispy potatoes. Also had their passion fruit mimosa. The ambiance is nicely fancy, place is spacious with a great representative decor of Montreal."}
{"text":"Je ne peux pas écrire un avis complet, nous avons simplement été pour un cocktail et des bouchées, mais je vais définitivement y retourner! L'endroit a l'air super et les bouchées goûtées étaient délicieuses!"}
{"text":"Beautiful concept of arts and food... I haven't seen a restaurant like that, it was a first. We had a sampling of food presented by the head chef himself. Every sample was made to savour in your mouth.

Overall, the pictures speak a thousand words.  I love the food and the atmosphere of the place. Without forgetting our main waiter who was fantastic. I will come back once again to sample the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Comme tous les ans au W, Yelp nous offre une soirée d'Halloween inoubliable, mais c'est sans oublier la participation de ÊAT, son restaurant, au fameux Oysterfest! 
Cette année j'ai été gâtée, aux bras de deux beaux jeunes hommes, nous avons reçu un accueil distingué, une table VIP, des coupes de champagne et une douzaine d'huîtres supplémentaires offertes par la maison. Le genre de soirée juste parfaite. Jolies serveuses, bon cuisinier, ambiance chic, décor urbain moderne, la qualité par excellence."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on the internet while looking up places to eat for my trip in Montreal. They had an awesome Oysters event when it was $10 per dozen of oysters and you can an aperol spritz cocktail! Isn't that amazing. No one can beat this deal. I would definitely come to this restaurant again. 

Oysters were pretty fresh and delicious. The cocktail was a nice complimentary drink with the meal. The hostess was friendly and servers were equally attentive. Sad that we couldn't stay for more than the oysters but it was still a cool experience.

Mum and I were on a budget with meals but the other dishes on the menu looked very delicious. A little high for our price range but the ambiance was set for more a fine dining experience. The art work was beautiful around the restaurant too."}
{"text":"Premier essai en octobre 2016. 
Nous avons bien aimé!

Déco éclectique créative. Serveurs sympathiques. 

Bonne table, menu varié. 
Très bien situé dans le Vieux-Montréal à deux pas du Métro Square Victoria. Adjacent à l'hôtel W."}
{"text":"Definitely catering to a young crowd. Actually the decor is pretty cool , rather artistic and socially conscious imagery with a lot of fun. The music is too loud to talk over provided by a DJ and if I was there just for drinks would have been fine. The paella , that I had been looking forward to was off the menu to make room for the two specials, beef   bourguignon and linguini with mussels, clams and calamari.  Since the specials sounded good the table of 4 split two and two. Wine suggestions were made the wine was fine. When the linguini came it was WAY over cooked and it was angel hair. We sent it back and got 4 beef as they tasted great and the the kitchen had lost our trust. The waiter immediately apologized and replaced the food with our request, but then forgot a drink order. When the check came the restaurant comped a total of two glasses of wine! We thought this rather insufficient but paid the bill and expressed our disappointment with the dinner. The waiter did apologize for our bad experience. The manager on duty never spoke to us and said good night as if nothing was wrong."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from eating the beef tartar at this restaurant. First and only meal of the day - without question this item. By far the worst sickness I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"We went there during oyster festival. The oyster was okay. We also ordered other food. The food was overpriced. We ordered seafood risotto. It was very very salty and was served in a small portion for $36. My friends ordered beef and chicken. They were not good either. Will not come back"}
{"text":"Went there for MTL A Table event. They offer a deal for 31$ for three courses.
We had tuna tartar and foie gras for starters. Paella for main course. Dessert were churros and chocolaty one.
The tuna tartar is very refreshing with a touch of almond and mint. The foie gras with grape sauce is light and flavorful. Paella was full of high quality seafood but the rice was bland. Churros were to much of oil. The other dessert was so sophisticated. Very good.
This restaurant is inside the W hotel. The deco is very unique and in a hippy style. overall a bit of pricey.
The service was good."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic dinner with some friends because of their Oysters event! $10 per dozen and it was yummy! The dozen of Oysters also includes a glass of white wine or beer. The event is ending on April 30th.

We also ordered the paella,the Canard (a mixture of many things) as well as an extra foie gras. Yummy Yummy Yummy. To finish off we added a seafood platters with big, I mean BIG BIG shrimp.

AAll the seafood we had was super fresh and the rest were super tasty! Be sure to try their foie gras, the Canard mixture also have foie gras.

As for service, our waiter Marc took great care of us! A1!

Price wise for sure it's a bit higher than a regular restaurant but it's not overly expensive for a restaurant inside of a hotel (W).

I just gotta say, everything was perfect and over my expectations!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast. While the food was good, it was very overpriced. I had the Smoked Salmon dish, which comes with cream cheese, one bagel, and an arugula salad, it was good, but not worth $36. The buffet was small and was $32. What was more important was that service was very, very bad. The waiter didn't bring out my dish, and ignored our table (most of the others had the buffet). I had to flag down a manager. The waiter offered be a coffee refill once (when my cup was half full) and then didn't come back. I wouldn't come back after this..."}
{"text":"Liked salmon pate, tapenade, very comtemporary pop art interior design. Fresh shrimps. Will be back someday to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant situated at the W Hotel is an open space seafood restaurant that also offers steak and duck. I ordered the red snapper with broccolini. The portions were acceptable and they accommodated my onion allergies. Since it was a Sunday evening on Labour day weekend service was very slow. It took around 2 1/2 hours since only one waitress was present. They did offer a complementary champagne which was appreciated. For dessert I had the sorbet with mango jelly & marshmallows. The sorbet was delicious and well presented. Ambience and decor were pleasant. Music selection was great as well."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant inside the W hotel - at 7pm I was the only patron on a holiday-Monday.
Good crusty bread (but I had to ask for it) and nice rose wine.  The Seafood Paella was prepared different from what I am used to seeing but it was in a good creative fashion.   It could have used less Andouille sausage.  The décor is very modern with many mod-paintings on every wall.  I can't remember what I ordered for dessert - I vaguely remember it was dark chocolate related (since that is the only thing I like) and that it was good."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with 3 other people, was happy with it.

Food: Very good. I had the lobster eggs benedict and it was great. Not a huge serving size but it was about right if you order the set meal with a smoothie, bread, etc. The smoothies were great, coffee was alright.

Service: A little slow. Otherwise service was nice. We didn't wait at all for a table on a Sunday for brunch.

Price: A little pricey for brunch but to be expected given that it's in a hotel. The set brunches are a good deal since they include a large smoothie which tasted fantastic.

Ambiance: based on decor, was more fancy than expected but the clientele there dressed as casually as we did. The lighting and design in the restaurant is great."}
