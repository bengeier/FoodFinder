{"text":"This place is usually super quiet and I'm not sure why because the dosa is VERY good, as are multiple other items they have on the menu. The service is fast and friendly. It's some of my favorite food in town for sure, and we try to come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"The people at Southern Spice must have read the previous review, because based on my experience there a few weeks ago they've definitely stepped up the service.  I found all of the staff to be friendly, attentive and helpful.  I went on a Sunday for their all-day buffet (Sundays only... I think through the week they do a lunch buffet).  As a vegetarian I am very partial to South Indian food, and I was not disappointed.  I started with a bowl of sambar (lentil soup) with idly (sticky patties made from rice and lentil flours).  Then, I went back for a larger plate of food: rice topped with dal and curried chickpeas, vegetable pakoras and coconut-scented vegetables.  As we were eating our main courses we were offered freshly-made masala dosas: thin lentil crepes stuffed with seasoned potatoes.  I love when buffets also include cooked-to-order food!  To finish, I sampled a little bowl of sweet payasam (kind of a sweet, warm soup) for dessert.  Everything was delicious.  The buffet also included some meat curries, and my friend said they were good.      I plan on going back for the Sunday buffet in the near future- hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"We'd ordered a couple of dishes for to-go only to realize later that they have been mixed up and we were served with the meat option when we'd specifically asked for the veg version. When we called the restaurant, the staff was downright rude and slammed the phone on me saying that they were busy. Is this acceptable for any establishment? I have been a regular patron of this restaurant and needless to say I am never going to step into this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Restaurant seem to be going downhill...it use to be good... waiting for placed orders takes forever due to \"someting\"... Some excuse...very poor choices when it comes to food option on the buffet which is already highly priced..."}
{"text":"I was recently deflowered by Southern Spice in Calgary, and being the dosa girl that I am, I was rather excited to try a new dosa joint in town.  This place was FANCY for a dosa place, but the service was HORRIBLE. I guess you can't have it all. The digs were hot, the service was cold. Figures. But let's get to the most important part: the food.  The food was tasty and very reasonable. What I especially love is that they offer 'Dosa Wednesdays' where you can get a Madras Masala Dosa for 5 BUCKS. Not kidding. What a steal! They are also famous for their 'South Indian Filter Coffee' which I opted not to try, but it looked pretty good. Their Sambar is good and I recommend their Masala Dosa.  If you can get past poor service to enjoy a tasty meal, then definitely give Southern Spice a try. But if you end up waiting a little too long to be seated, or feel ignored throughout your meal, don't say I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"Just went here for dinner tonight. It's an alright place, the best place I know for dosa.. and that's about it. Will I go back? Yes, and only for the dosa.. and I'll have to ensure to request the don't make it super spicy.   Don't get me wrong. I am Indian, and loooooooooove spicy food, but if  I find something spicy, I know others will be on fire. Case & point.. my mother. My mom wanted to try something new and ordered the briyani.. something we often make at home but she wanted to experience the southern flavours. Unfortunately it was super spicy and the raita (yogurt) was 75% onion, and 25% yogurt. The yogurt dish would have helped with the spiciness had there been an appropriate amount served.   I ordered the premium? paneer veggie dosa.. LOVED it. I love the red sauce, and love the coconut chutney even more. My only concern was that the paneer was just too spicy. Soo sad, as I lovee paneer.   The food is pretty cheap compared to everywhere else, service is very efficient.  They have a gorgeous bar, and the overall ambiance is just-ok, but they need to ease up off the spice a lil."}
{"text":"I want to rate between 2.5 and 3 stars.   Was searching for some restaurant in NE which would serve dinner buffet on Sunday. Phoned few restaurants to verify if they were serving dinner  buffets. Finally ended with this one as I have tried the rest all restaurants before. Being a south Indian, couldn't just leave without trying this place. Outside appearance looked like it would be gloomy and small inside. But all my assumptions were overtaken by a nice built bar with wood inside the restaurant  and also the place was pretty decent.  Washrooms were clean and neat.    As usual, opted for buffet. Buffet menu had fish curry, eggplant curry, Egg masala,chicken curry,cauliflower fry, pakoda, vada( how to say.. i can define it, its like old fashioned doughnut but without sweet in it and more crispy).  And elated to see south Indian recipes... Idly,Dosa,Chapati,Sambar, Rasam,More kolambu(in tamil language)( it is made of curd and some vegetables and onion) and  it is one of my faves, Rice and noodles.  Really excited to see the whole menu of buffet and grabbed all the items hoping not miss even a single item without tasting.   Good ones: Eggplant curry,fish curry,vada, idli, dosa, Rasam.  Bad ones : Chutney(which we take along with idli and dosa) ( tasted bad), chapati ( very hard and we asked for the fresh ones but even they tasted the same) , Rice ( was not fresh and  became hard too),More kolambu( one of my faves and it was very worse , seems like they had cooked it the day morning and continuing the same which made it taste sour), Pakoda was very hard to eat( wish we had enough energy to bite them ) . So so : Egg masala, chicken curry,sambar. Service was not bad. Even there was a pretty decent crowd than i assumed.  The specialty of this place is that the way the curries were made and the items are different from other south indian restaurants like vada, more kolambu, rasam etc. But they failed to  score much in my screening test.  Overall : I won't visit this place again as it is very far for me to reach from downtown and also the price was $15.95(excluding tax).( costly). Rather I would prefer raj palace to southern spice. It is a typical tamil restaurant ( tamilnadu,a province in india). If you are near to this place, you may try this.  They do have onion utappam, and many other typical tamilnadu food but costly."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently went to India and really enjoyed Kerala & the south. When we heard about this restaurant, we decided to try it. It was fantastic!!! We found the food to be authentic and managed to eat some of our favourite dishes from our trip. The ambience was a little plain, but that is India for you ;)"}
