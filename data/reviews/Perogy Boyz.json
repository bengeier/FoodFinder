{"text":"Borscht is Amazing!! Extremely rich developed flours! I got two side soups for lunch it was That good. I wish they sold it in 1L take home containers...."}
{"text":"I finally tried Perogy Boyz, and it was just ok, the perogies were good i got the Mexican ones.. but the Kielbasa sausage was not.. i have had Kielbasa before so that is why i picked it.. but it was not like others i have had..
the main killer was the price it was really not worth the $15  6 perogies and a sausage  and pop for  what i got i could have go a big Club house meal or something for filling. ... I tried it that is all that i wanted to do.. but that would be it for me..."}
{"text":"Food was great. Perogies were tender and delicious, and I liked they Mexican twist they put on my Perogies. However, $15 for two sausages and 4 or 5 Perogies is ridiculous. You are meant to be full and sluggish after eating Ukrainian food. In this case I actually had to get a big Mac meal at McDonald's before I returned to work. Its a food truck, they aren't renting a 17th ave storefront for $3200 a month. I have no problem with paying $15 for quality food,(and it was quality) but I had better be full afterwards"}
{"text":"With 75% Ukrainian heritage, I've pretty much got perogies coursing through my veins.  I know some people who are big fans of this truck, so I decided to hit it up during Beakerhead in Olympic Plaza. As you can guess from the two star rating, I was rather disappointed. On the menu that night were traditional cheddar and potato perogies, nacho perogies, and apple dessert perogies.  I went with the traditional, since I assumed that they would have that perfected. Unfortunately, these were no better than the frozen ones from Costco that I make at home.  Scratch that...I like mine better. 

At $8 for 8, I would expect gourmet elements while respecting the traditional composition: homemade smetana (which is more like creme fraiche than sour cream in fat content), a really sharp cheese filling, and nice crispy lardons. As they were, these middle of the road perogies were worth $5 tops. I understand that they switch up the offbeat perogies now and again, but nachos is an underwhelming choice for me. If you have a three item menu, every one of the them has to be stellar.  If they reduced the price of (or gourmet-ified) the traditional, and stuck with innovative fillings like the duck and saskatoons they had on Eat St., they'd get out of my bad books. Come on, comrades!"}
{"text":"After seeing these guys on the TV, I've been patiently waiting to try them for a few months.  Then they were up in the NW recently so I decided to see what the fuss is about.  First of all it's not cheap.  $9 for 8 perogies, additional $4 for sausage and $4 if you want the borscht soup.  Perogies, sausage and soup for two - $34. This better be good!

The soup was pretty good, a little bland but with a nice dollop of sour cream.  Unfortunately it went downhill from there.  My wife and I had some traditional and some old school perogies with the kielbasa sausage.  I opened the box and was instantly underwhelmed, the perogies were tiny with a small amount of onion and bacon over the top, three pretty small pieces of sausage with sour cream and mustard slapped all over the place.  Both varieties of perogies were largely tasteless, dough heavy with barely enough filling.  It is also clear they do not clean their grill often enough as the perogies were liberally coated with a the burnt remains from a previous order which left a charcoal like taste in the mouth.  These guys need to do a lot better.

So, totally overated in my view and certainly not worth the money.  I won't be going back; which is a shame as, like another reviewer said, I really wanted to like the Perogy Boyz."}
{"text":"Love the fact that these guys are doing Perogies street side! The borscht is excellent and you have to try the duck!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food fer sure, but the price (high) and quantites (small) are absurd.  I will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Perogy Boyz came to our event and were a huge hit!  First of all, they were so friendly, enthusiastic and easy to work with - it was a real pleasure to have them.  And of course, the fantastic food...I was born and bred in Alberta so I know my perogies. I had the Traditional - they were tender, fresh, and delicious.  Just the right combination of textures. The fillings were generous and flavourful. The jalapeno cheese sausage was also excellent!  Juicy and not too spicy. I am a pretty good eater, and I thought the portions were generous and well-priced.  I was actually surprised at how much food I got for the price.  Definitely one of my favourite food trucks.  Thanks Perogy Boyz!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that no one has Yelped about this one yet. The new food trucks have been super trendy since they opened.

I am a HUGE fan of perogies. Any kind of dumplings, really. I'm Chinese. I know my dumplings. I finally found the time to hunt the Perogy Boyz truck down by foot last week at the Ox & Angela grand opening. That night, they only had their Mexicali, Traditional and Carrot Cake perogies on the menu. I'm not a huge fan of sausage, so I decided not to order any of those, but I did get the Traditional and the Carrot Cake.

The guy who took my order (I think he tweets for them) was very friendly and the cooking staff was quick and efficient. Perogies will set you back $7 per order. They were pan-fried pockets of deliciousness. The Traditional was very staisfying. The filling was just cheesy enough, not overwhelming, not too salty, and served with fried onions. It was the perfect ratio of dough to filling. No sour ceam though. The Carrot Cake blew my mind. The cinnamon-caramel and icing sugar really made it wonderful. It was a great contrast to the savoury filling. But I must confess, I couldn't taste the carrot. Still was super yummy.

Final verdict: Cute food truck, very Portland inspired. A great way to get some gourmet food without having to step into a restaurant. Excellent alternative to fast food. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because I found it to be a bit overpriced. 6 perogies for $7? Can't you at least make it 7 perogies? I couldn't get enough of them!"}
{"text":"My friend had told me many good things about Perogy Boyz. So when she heard they were going to be in Bragg Creek for Bragg Creek Days, we decided to make an afternoon trek out there. I got the Traditional Perogies, as I like my perogies basic but delicious. They were pretty decent, but bordering on being bland. They were saved by the caramelized onions and bacon for sure. They also added dill on top of the perogies, which actually wasn't a bad bite with the perogy and sour cream. However, it clashed with the bacon and onions. I would like to try them again, especially because the apple pie perogies sound amazing."}
{"text":"SOOOOOO good!  We had them yesterday when they were in the southwest at the CIBC on Southport Road (Please come back down south again, we loved!) and the girls and I ran over and it was sooooooo good.  Wish for a bigger menu though.  Had the Cabbage roll sausage last time and it was AMAZING! We had the traditional perogies and sausage and it was great!  
Beat the line so that was great!  
Find them!  They are sooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Yum.

I gave away my food truck virginity (in Calgary anyway) the the boyz today and I am glad I did. Very tasty! And even more awesome is that they came out to be a part of the ARF Walk and Wag charity walk supporting a local dog/cat rescue agency.

I order taker man was very friendly. I asked him what he would recommend and after a couple of questions to make sure I wasn't a vegetarian or pciky eater, he suggested the Mexi Cali perogies. They were ground beef perogies with lettuce, green onions, cheese and a delicious tomato compote sprinkled on top. There was a tasty sauce drizzled as well as some sour cream. For $7 I thought it was an excellent snack/lunch to eat in the park-and fast too. I do agree though mayb one or two more perogies would have been a better deal.

I was impressed they were using biodegradable containers (some of our new food trucks don't) and they had a garbage can and recycling bin available as well. I noticed after I ordered it was starting to get busy and they made sure to tell people that there would be a bit of a wait (5-10 min) which it appears they met later when I looked to see when those customers got their food-it is always awesome to manage peoples expectations.

Overall I am very impressed with this food truck and the Perogie Boyz get my approval."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Perogy Boyz, I really did. Today at lunch my husband and I decided to head downtown to find a food truck.  He is a HUGE fan of perogies so it was an easy decision which one we were going to stalk.

We arrived and they had 3 kinds of perogies; mexicali, duck with ponzu and carrot cake.  They also had three different sausages.  My husband chose the mexicali and I chose the duck.  We decided to split the kielbasa.  For two orders of perogies, one sausage and two sodas it was $22.

The perogies were pretty tasty but the serving sizes were very stingy.  There were only 6 slices of sausage for $6 (I think).  After finishing lunch we were still hungry.  Also, the aioli that came with the mexicali perogies was tasteless.

Our lunch was nevertheless enjoyable, though, since we got to enjoy the late fall day in Central Memorial Park.  I am happy that the food truck movement has hit Calgary but I will not be returning to the Perogy Boyz truck any time soon.

I added photos of our lunch so that you can see the serving sizes for yourself."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed on the size and quality of the food, especially for the money. I am also hating on them because their truck is a polluting piece of crap. I was behind them the other day and they were spewing smog so bad I literally gagged."}
{"text":"Had some perogy and sausage at the food truck festival in Calgary. I have to say I was disappointed. $9 for perogy or $13 for perogy and sausage. I opted for the second option. Instead of a full size sausage I received 3 slices of cheap stuff anyone can get in a supermarket surely not eastern European. Why would you charge $4 for 3 slices of sausage? The food was cold so it didn't taste nice."}
{"text":"Yay for Perogy Boyz coming back to our Nolan Hill area! I was craving these bad boyz for awhile now so I would have driven a distance to find them today anyways! 
The staff, as friendly as ever and it was a treat to meet the owner.
I have to upgrade my review as we got to try the spicier version today and I loved the perogies even more! Ask for the jalapeno ones if you want a kick! Deeeeelish! (Just little pieces of jalapeno baked inside the potato)
This truck gets my creative juices flowing and gets me thinking about what I would do if I had a perogy truck! The options are endless and I think this business is a great concept! Apparently their method of making the perogy has been changed (machine based rather than hand rolled due to cost) but they are still family made and I think they are great! You have to try for yourself!
We had 2 different kinds of sausage today and fresh,cool sour cream. I loved that the bacon was plentiful and the onions were fried perfectly, not overly done. The perogies were piping hot to order!
Watch out for the new poutine perogies and a new version of Mexican that I am told may be coming out sooner than later! YUM!
Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Recently had their traditional perogies and they were amazing! 
Traditional - Perogies topped with:
caramelized onions, double smoked bacon, sour cream, fresh chives & dill. Sliced Kielbasa and grainy mustard on the side ($14)
When you see the price being $14 sure it may be a little expensive but their dessert perigees are also amazingly delicious and way cheaper ($5), it just depends what you get :)"}
{"text":"When we, Caprices Fine Arts, had our art event this weekend the Perogy Boyz graciously were in attendance.  Being able to offer a food option at the show really helped and added so much to the over all  festivities. Both patrons and artists were so jazzed to have them there since everyone has seen them on Eat Street.  They were fast and friendly and served up some of the most delectable perogies I ever ate!  Perogy Boyz were the perfect addition to the event and I will always ask them to be a part of our shows."}
{"text":"OMG.  I grew up eating perogies, and so on my last visit home to Calgary, I had to check out Perogy Boyz.   Being that I now live in Austin, Texas, home of a thriving food trailer scene, it seemed fitting that I try the Mexi Cali's.

Delicious!  

I couldn't resist three orders.  These are not my granny's perogies!"}
{"text":"The Perogy Boyz van across the street from my work today gave me the extra reason to try their version of my all time favourite meal.

I ordered the 'Big Boris' sized MexiCali (2 sausages & 10 perogies).  One of the things I noticed is that the prices are fairly high for a street vendor ($15 for my meal without a drink).  The MexiCali itself was a mix of ground beef, chili aioli, tomato 'tartar', green onion, and cheddar cheese.  Also served with it were sour cream and spicy dijon mustard.  On my first bite, I heard the angels signing.  The second bite had light shining upon me as I danced in a circle, fork in my hand and awesome in my mouth.  The sausage was equally awesome with a yummy garlic hit.  

It's a good 10 minute wait from ordering to receiving food, but it was well worth the wait.  For the price, it's something I would have only once in a while, though I am now officially a born-again Ukrainian."}
{"text":"Finally got to try these guys. They were at the South Centre night market. 

They probably had the longest wait out of the different trucks so my wife and I shared a dish here and killed our dinner appetite at Beaver Tails. Overall the perogies are completely average, but they hit the spot. They have lots of different toppings so you can try a combo that might be different from what you might make at home."}
{"text":"Food, good but nothing we couldn't do ourselves just as well at home.  Reasonable pricing.  It was the 55 min wait in line (the linw was NOT that long) that will have us never going back.  The wait should've been a half-hour or less."}
{"text":"Tried the poutine perogies. Maybe it wasn't quite my flavour. Should have stuck to the regular perogies, BUT the people were so nice and the truck is pretty awesome. I still think it was worth it. I definitely hope they aren't out in this blistering hot weather though, those poor people! I can't even imagine!"}
{"text":"When I first heard about the Perogy Boyz food truck earlier last summer, I had visions of piles of perogies dancing through my head! Growing up, my Grandma made perogies every year for us to fill our freezer with. Potato and cheddar, potato and cottage cheese, some with bacon, even sour kraut ones (which were never my favourite. I think it was that the filling looked black when she made them that kept me away!)

When I was in University, perogy night in the cafeteria was always a big hit. $0.25 perogies with all of the bacon bits and sour cream you wanted. Over the years, I've loved my perogies. I've even stopped buying the store bought ones, yes siree, only handmade perogies bought from farmers markets and the likes for this girl. Except now I can get them from a food truck... and they're handmade... and they're perogies I never would've thought to make.

Over the weekend, I got to making a batch of perogies with a friend that's in visiting from Vancouver. Making the dough, rolling it out, cutting out all the little circles (he did that part), mixing up the filling (also him) and then spooning the filling into the centre and pinching the little pockets closed by hand (me!!) is a crap ton of work. It took us 2 hours to make dinner.

Why do I bring all of this up? As silly as it sounds, I had some preconceived notions about perogies. I've often taken them for granted (I'm sorry perogies, I won't ever do it again, I swear!) But I've done some serious soul searching and found an appreciation for a little pocket that's been well-made. Perogy Boyz hand makes the perogies. When I went, I had the Mexi-Cali perogies (ground beef, chili aioli, tomato 'tartar', green onion, cheddar cheese). There was a touch of dijon mustard (I think? It had a horse radish kind of bite) with the perogies that I could have done without. It was pissing rain while I waited in line for my order, by the time I got to the front of the truck, I decided I needed some borscht as well. When it was time to order, the new friends I had made in line and I wanted to take a picture. The order taker man (as Lauren H so eloquently called him!) asked if he could be in the photo with us! Five stars for him :). The borscht was hot and steamy, full of flavours and aromas... it wasn't quite my dad's borscht, but it was close. The full compliment to my meal was some knackwurst, also a good portion. I took my food home and got stuffed like a perogy!

Pricewise, all of that cost me $15. $7 for 6 perogies, $4 for the borscht and $4 for the knackwurst. I've heard a few folks complaining about the prices, all I've got to say is quality over quantity my friends. It's Taste Restaurant behind the Perogy Boyz. I have no doubt the ingredients going into these perogies fit right in with my desire for quality food.

One thing to be wary of though, I know these guys want to support the environment and all, which I think has resulted in recycled food containers... those babies are NOT good in the rain. Walking back to my car, I just about lost my borscht and the containers were getting soggy. So, try them on a nice day when you can sit in the nearby park eating your perogies :)."}
{"text":"Ok so I probably would have given them 3* but here's the thing.
The 'fried' part wasn't very fried.
and also the board said 8 perogies for $10, and I even clarified this with the lady in the truck... Well, I take my box back to work and find that there are only 6!

On an up note. I wanted something spicy so I ordered the 'mexican' style perogies (can't remember the name).. and find out that it's with normal perogies, just topped with salsa, sour cream, and jalepenos.... so I ask for the jalepeno cheddar perogies which they happily substituted.  Makes me think why they don't just make it with that in the first place?  I feel like maybe they just have plain perogies and the only thing different is the topping... which makes it not so special."}
