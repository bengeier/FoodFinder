{"text":"This place was like a great breath of fresh air. I have bee to jap village but they rush you out there. Here at OMO Teppan you are treated like a friend coming for dinner.  I did not try the sushi but I would imagine it would be fantastic just like the dinner.  Mark was our number one chef and I highly recommend him for entertainment . The yum yum sauce is fantastic too.  OMO also has a complete full bar to choose from.  Not sure how long they have been here but I am so glad they are here now as I will become a regular.  I am part of a dinner club and go out monthly. I have to many places but this by far is one of my favourites."}
{"text":"It's tradition that my family and me go for Teppanyaki at the end of the school year. We usually go to Japanese village, but this time decided to try something new. I read some other Yelp reviews and thought hey, why not. This use to by \"The One Sushi\", and is now OMO.  I'm glad we decided to eat here, the staff were all friendly, and the service was very good. Our server Alam, not Alan was on top of all our requests. I had the surf and turf, my son had chicken karaage. Also at the table, sukiyaki beef, and teppanyaki shrimp. Our chef was very good and funny as well. If you are familiar with Japanese Village, then you know what your in for when you come to OMO. They use some of the same corny lines when they are cooking, e.g., oil used for cooking is 10W30, shrimp is from the Bow River etc. (you get the picture). The sauces are identical to JV as well. They have steak sauce, and ginger sauce for your veggies. Also familiar are the miso soup to start, The salad dressing however is different. Also at the end of your meal you get a choice of various icecream flavors to choose from. Well you get 3 choices. Green tea, strawberry and ? The pluses of going here VS Japanese Village. If you don't like trying to find a parking spot or pay for parking come here. They have a private lot that is free. The space also is new, so it doesn't have that greasy floor feeling and the flat grill surfaces used for cooking are still scratch and stain free. Did I mention their are no hoodfans ?  Well the food gets vented in front of the cook. If you're a fan of JV, than you should definitely give OMO a try. They won't disappoint. I will surely be back to get my Teppanyaki fix soon  Thanks Alam and staff !!!"}
{"text":"Food is good here  Recommend the ribeye and shrimp  Meal is coming with veggies ,miso soup, rice and the ice cream"}
{"text":"So before I went to OMO Teppanyaki, I did a quick research whether or not their KOBE BEEF is legit, like 120% REEEAAALL. At first, I thought that their Kobe beef that they advertise on their website is bull%$##, but they hyperlinked the seemingly genuine website, sorry can't read Japanese, with lists of restaurant names all across the world that carries the, *registered Kobe beef. This is the Japanese website OMO is referring to:  http://www.kobe-niku.jp/shop/?lang=1  Lo and behold, there IT IS, an OMO teppanyaki as a designated registration store right from Japan...welp, let's go try their...drum roll please, a 6oz new york steak...err right I will try Kobe beef later when my GF is ready to pay for my meal lmao. Well, that's because it's god damn expensive, I mean 4oz cost freaking $138! that's crazy for a poor guy like me and that's as far as my wallet allows. Oh, my poor wallet.  Anyways as for my little $27 6oz new york steak: The new york steak was done pretty good, I liked how juicy it was and also cooked to how I wanted it. I tell them not to undercook it as I absolutely hate it. Everything MUST be medium well done and the chef did oblige my request. I think I will give 4 stars for their professional attitude and overall good customer service skills.  The ambiance of the restaurant is about average so I give 3.5 stars Really there's NOTHING memorable about it tbh..maybe except that I so wanted to be served at that bright neon yellow teppanyaki table rather than the black colored teppanyaki table where I was sitting :( Actually, the tablecloth was a nice touch but really they should have more of THAT bright neon yellow teppanyaki tables!  I gave overall 3 stars because I realized that this restaurant just newly opened and perhaps working on perfecting their restaurant business, I will give it a go but would not have 120% expectation. I will come back maybe a month later down the road to finally try their genuine Kobe beef and see how their chefs and menu turns out. Finger crossed my GF will treat me a 6oz Kobe beef."}
{"text":"Although have had better in Asia, still a very fine example of good teppanyaki, OMO is worth a visit.   Run by a crew of asian staff, the chicken and beef tep were well executed, including the flames and fork, knife and peppershaker flying routines for the pleasure of their seated 'fans.' Our pinoy tep man, Joseph, was affable and entertaining.  What comes with the meal? A pleasant sparse salad with nicely-flavoured vinagrette, lots of fresh grilled vegetables, a small bowl of fluffy unlimited rice, and your choice of meat, all tender and nicely dressed with both cooking and tableside sauces as desired. As well, portions were decent. To taper off this full feed, a small bowl of either matcha tea, vanilla or strawberry ice cream tries to do it right, but nothing special here, as ice had formed in my wife's matcha and the strawberry was plain low-end fare.  At the door when leaving, every group on this father's day got to spin a wheel for a contest draw or free small-item coupons upon a return visit. As well, they provide a loyalty card for a further 10% discount. Foxy marketing, but the impression left with us is that it's all designed to somehow soften the exorbitant prices. And, in reality, the place was sparsely seated for a sunny Father's Day.  Although somewhat pricey spanning $27-50+ per person depending on the quality of your meat, it's fairly authentic and in that respect won't be a waste of your time.  But that is where it stops for us: the 'vegetables only' choice at $18 is over-the-top dumb because all the regular meat meals already come with plenty of mixed veggies. Therefore to us it's just another example of milking customers to the max while they are there: I think they've got it all backwards, but knowing some history on this style of marketing, not surprised. Not unlike Harry Rosen's, a 10% discount and a small 'next time' coupon is negligible when the prices already far out-distance value. Likely never return."}
{"text":"Amazing presentation, friendly staff, great atmosphere will recommend. I ordered treasure island sashimi platter, and teppan combo. Good portion size. Tuesday is teppan Tuesday is teppan Tuesday. Good value"}
{"text":"OMO had great service. Food was amazing. Staff was courteous. The restaurant was clean and food was fresh. Teriyaki was soft and flavorful, salmon sashimi was fresh, and the portions were well balanced. Will come back again to OMO!"}
{"text":"Loved our date night at OMO Teppan And Sushi!  The food and was awesome! We had the salmon, shrimp and waygu and our chef put on a great Teppan show! For starters we had some sashimi and the flying dragon roll - all tasted delicious   Our server, Alam was wonderful and so friendly  Definitely going back for their lunch special! Thanks OMO"}
{"text":"This restaurant not worth for a visit. First it's pricey. I know that Kobe won't be cheap but their meat isn't fresh. Second the regular food such as ribeye was forozen, and the taste even worse than other buffet places. Third the drink I ordered was joke it's mixed with can juice and other stuff not taste right. I will see how long this restaurant will hold up in 2018."}
{"text":"I came here twice in one week because my first time I ordered their pork belly with rice and I was in love! It came with super tender flavourful fatty pork with rice vegetables and thee most delicious roasted Brussels sprouts you will ever try!!! (I know ick brusselsprouts but TRY IT now I'm in love with Brussels sprouts only if they are cooked this way) other than that the restaurant Teppan is almost exactly the same as Japanese village. Same show and same food but I prefer the parking here better than downtown. Second time I came I ordered the cauliflower casserole yuck and yuck for the Salsbury steak. Didn't like that at all."}
{"text":"Went there for family dinner tonight.  We took up 1.5 table.  Kids had so much fun.  Great atmosphere for family get together.  Food were great.  My boy said we have to go there more often."}
