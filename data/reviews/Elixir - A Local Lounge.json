{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere when I first walked in. Absolutely beautiful and I thought to myself that I could possibly be a regular here. My kind of place until the service. I was with a big group of about ten at a table. Our waitress never acknowledged me not even as she was bringing everyone else's food and drinks out. I finally had to ask her if I could order too. She never once smiled at any of us and she dropped a drink on one of the ladies in the group. She lost one of our ladies credit and didn't apologize and acted like it was not her fault. To top it off my credit card was charged twice. I'm able to give places the benefit of doubt and will try it one more time but the service better be good or I will not go back. Disappointed."}
{"text":"VEGETARIAN options in every food category! Awesome happy hour specials- (3-6 am and pm) where else can you get a glass of Stella for $3!!?!? Football specials during every NFL game! Phenomenal staff- super nice and friendly! Open 24 hours! And breakfast served 24/7! My new favorite hangout! Great gaming incentives!  You must go!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great my husband and I just moved to the area and thought we would check it out. The food was awesome not you typical bar food ... atmosphere was very nice and our server Chelsea was great she was very friendly and informative.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"As I am new to yelp, I will try to make this as useful as possible for those in the green valley area. I read a recent review regarding the smoking. Yes, there are people smoking. I don't smoke, but this is a bar. If it bothers you, go to any number of restaurants that don't allow it. They have good ventilation and it is not at all smoky. On to the bar. On my most recent visits I have been served by CoCo and Teresa, easily two of the most personable bartenders I have come across. The whiskey selection is outstanding, and they always have something interesting to recommend. Same with the beer selection; it is not the biggest selection but eclectic. The food is far above any bar in the area. Do yourself a favor and check this place out!"}
{"text":"One of my friends started working at this place when it opened. I enjoyed it back then because it was nice to get out of the typical bar environment. Recently, they've added a nice red felted pool table to match the ambiance of the place (along with Golden Tee) and I'm a happier camper. The service staff are all very friendly and the food is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, burger was burnt and tasted like charcoal, had a $9 cocktail that was undrinkable, employees seemed to hate their life's, and heard a fight almost break out in the kitchen. Definitely won't be coming back. The decor was pretty neat but the place is nothing but a run down pt's in disguise."}
{"text":"I used to come here to watch some reggae music a while back and I came here on a Saturday night and this lounge got a complete makeover; I didn't even recognize the place. The photos on here doesn't do the interior any justice. Large red velvet couches, big chandeliers. Service and food was excellent. Wish I got the name of our server, she was a doll. I would reccomend the fried mash potato bites for an appetizer! Live music topped of the night. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and sweet... great service, awesome food, and strong drinks!!! I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Just had the brie (appetizer), French onion soup, stroganoff, and banana fritters.   Brie was slightly under cooked and I wish the caramelized onions had been served atop or in the side for a little more crunch and the water crackers was a bit of a let down. But the flavors were very nice.   The French onion soup had an excellent broth and imo a bit too much cheese but overall very pleasant.   The stroganoff's gravy was yummy. I wish it had been made with egg noodles (instead of a spaghetti noodle) and a few slices of the garlic bread to sop up the yumminess.   For desert my amazing waitress suggested the banana fritters- loved 'em!!!!   I will be returning to try their pork chops (another Chelsea recommendation) and the meatballs three ways appetizer.   Ambiance- for a bar/casino/restaurant- the dark reds and blacks with candle lit tables are casual enough for a first date but formal enough for a great  modestly upscale meal.    Overall, I would recommend Elixer lounge and suggest you bring your appetite."}
{"text":"I loved the place.  My wife and I have been looking for a date night spot and struck gold with this place....the food was great our waitress Chelsea was amazing...I recommend the meatballs 3 ways appetizer...if you haven't been please do so and support this newly opened business :)  I know I will"}
{"text":"Hubby & I have been here for breakfast & lunch. Omelets & home fries were great, as well as the Italian sandwich & fantastic sweet potato fries. Chelsea is a very upbeat & attentive server. Love the décor, music & comfortable booths. This will become a regular in our daily restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"Completely average. At least they try to look KIND of different inside, but nothing special food or drink-wise. I've been here a handful of times in the past five years or so.. pretty confused about how it could get an average of 4 stars."}
{"text":"I don't understand any of the bad reviews. I've been coming here for a year now, and it is my favorite bar in the area. I eat steak frites 5 times a week. As a transplant from holland, it's nice to have a place that feels like home."}
{"text":"Awesome service from the one and only Tony! Great food! Always a great time! Try the salmon, it is delicious!"}
{"text":"We've been here 5-6 times so far, and never been disappointed with any aspect of this establishment. Great service, great food, great music, awesome atmosphere. Try it for yourself, Friday and Saturday between 8 and 11 for live music!"}
{"text":"This place had potential so much potential ! And they droped the ball hard. I mean lets start with thier service I dont remember her name but she was amazing greatest service I've had in the valley hands down. However the food was anything but worth the visit . Baked brie sounds amazing but its not , a small pile of crackers and a few grapes from smiths and the rhind to go with your brie :/ , oh and lets not forget the sad sandwhich with cold meat and boring bread . Skip this place save yourself the pain"}
{"text":"Great place! Teresa and Maria are awesome!!! The specialty drinks like the Elixir or the Noble Irishman are amazing."}
{"text":"A Groupon took us there last weekend. It sounded kind of cool and chill. We arrived rather early on a Saturday night--probably before six. It was trendy-looking with black and red decor--a little modern gothic. However, at that time, it was brightly lit, sports games were playing on big monitors, and country music was blaring. Was it a sports bar or a chill-out lounge? Very strange. Closer to 7, the lights went down, and we saw a musician setting up, so perhaps later into the evening it looks like it the name suggests.   I ordered the Elixir Margarita, which was probably one of the worst I've ever had. It tasted like straight lime juice. I like a little more sweet.  It was happy hour when I ordered it, so it wasn't very expensive.   Our Groupon was for an appetizer and two entrees. We ordered the nachos. The up side was that it was a HUGE portion. This would have been perfect for a table of friends sharing some munchies over happy hour.  For two of us, it was a MEAL! It was not that great tasting, though. The meat was pretty flavorless, and the real cheese stuck it all together pretty fast. Kind of reminded me of when I make nachos at home. Eh.   My husband ordered a steak, and it was cooked nicely, and it had a good flavor.  I ordered Angel Hair Pasta, and it was fresh and had a nice flavor.  I only ate a few bites because of the nachos, and I took the rest home. The next night my family of 4 ate it for dinner. It was that big of a portion!  I'm ambivalent about going there again to eat.   Apparently they have live music in the evenings on the weekends, so if we're in the neighborhood, I think I'd like scope it out then."}
{"text":"What a wonderful, cozy, comfortable local lounge!  We always feel so welcome when we come here!  The drinks are awesome and the food is great too!  I absolutely love the Cobb salad here!  The bartenders Tony and Teresa are so friendly and personable.  We held a party here last month and all of our guests loved the atmosphere!  Live music or DJs on the weekend, I can't say enough about my favorite local lounge!"}
{"text":"We came in on my anniversary after discovering that 3 of our top dining choices for the evening were closed. The staff vent over backward to make it special. The red and black decor is lovely and romantic.  We had been on a Saturday evening for live music once before but as a Monday night they had on the game. They silenced the game and put on crooner old Vegas music and lowered the lights. Just for us.  They made a wonderful, and i do mean wonderful rib eye for my husband and i tried one of the house specials. Apparently everything is house made. It was delicious and we were cared for and cared about while we were here."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Elixir for three years now at least 3 times a week. They have many healthy food options, including an amazing blackened salmon Caesar. The bartenders make Elixir more than just a bar with gaming; they make it a second home."}
{"text":"I didn't try more than 1 drink but was happy with it. Had s licorice stick. Super yummy."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  Friendly staff, awesome drinks with excellent food and specials everyday..."}
{"text":"Nice little local hangout. Grabbed lunch with a friend and the food was great. Surprisingly not very busy during the lunch hour as we expected. Atmosphere was great. It's like any other local bar except more of an upscale feel. Waiter was really friendly. Cool looking little place being on the side of a hill. I'd definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"Great company, Elixir is associated with Remedy's. The best bar food, hands down. 12/2014 Sunday Brunch had plenty of choices, we both had omelets. $6.49 for an omelet, hash browns and toast. We had a choice of  toast and addins. So much, I'm taking half home. My husband hurt himself eating it all, he's happily miserable. Nice smooth coffee, too."}
{"text":"If you want to be greeted with a wall of cigarette smoke and have that as your ambience while dining then you are at the right place.  I haven't been to a place so thick with death sticks and would never dine here.  Now to look for a place for brunch where food won't be spiced with cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the interior design. I would take any friends here for a night out that is close to home but not the typical dive or gaming bar feel. This place feels snazzy.  The us timer service is great. All of the hosts are interactive and make you feel comfortable but not overwhelmed.  Thanks for a superb environment to relax and have a drink."}
{"text":"a neighbor suggested we stop in.  we got a chance yesterday and it was very enjoyable.  The bartender, Maria,was great...super attentive and had cool new wave/  punk music playing in the bar.  the gaming was good. we were able to play for a while...variety of options including 5 and 10 cent slots.    we tried the six taco appetizer and it was tasty.  cool goth decor is a nice change from standard poker bars."}
{"text":"Love coming in after I get off of my Fri graveyard shift to catch the tail end of Pat's and Brando in the morning!  The food is always amazing and the service and company even better!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a Saturday evening to grab dinner and drinks. I was looking for a place with a little more ambience than our usual local chains. I was so impressed with Elixir! The live music was great and the place has an intimate feeling no matter where you are sitting. Great cocktails and the recommendations from our server were on point. The food was great too - fresh, tasty and great portions for such a reasonable price! I currently live in the San Francisco area and I couldn't believe that we got two meals, dessert and three cocktails for around $50- I would have paid that for the cocktails alone in the Bay. I am surprised the place wasn't packed- I hope it does well and becomes a local favorite!"}
{"text":"1st time here. A very romantic setting. Our waitress Erin just wonderful she was very helpful with the menu.  Ahi tuna salad delicious.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The first time we came to Elixir was over a year ago. As soon as we walked in we greeted by Tony and Teresa. They made us feel so comfortable. Over the year we have frequented this bar and have always been treated with welcoming bar tenders...never have they disappointed us. The ambiance is amazing...the food is great...and the employees are always on point. They have many giveaways if you are a gamer. I highly recommend this bar."}
{"text":"I totally don't want to be mean, because everyone is so friendly. But I was starving and we shared so many plates... Chicken wings, fried pork chops, lettuce wraps, goat cheese dip, mushroom soup, and wow, seriously, like everything is below par. Maybe a cook left and they're scrambling, maybe it'll be better another day, but no, today when I'm super hungry, everything eas below average. Dry pork, flavorless goat cheese, watery mushroom soup, super salty chicken lettuce wraps.. Ugh. I'm so upset"}
{"text":"This lounge is a hidden gem in my opinion. It's inconspicuously placed on green valley next to some apartments and an past a strip mall. But once you find it, it's a nice spot. On Fridays and Saturdays they have live music usually local artists or small artists and the people who play are always super nice and will take requests sometimes. I would say they have quite a few more country music acts then anything else which is fine by me! They also have a pool table which is easily accessible since this place is usually not super crowded unless they have an event going on and even then it doesn't get that crazy ANOTHER HUGE PLUS! Since I'm mostly opposed to human contact.   Now on to the bar. There is bar seating and  table seating near the bar. The beer selection is practically non existent, they have maybe 4 or 5 beers on tap which sucks if your preference lyes with beer. However they will make you basic cocktails e.i. Whisky sour, jack and coke, vodka pineapple...but anything beyond that will prove to be too complex for most of the bar tenders here (but they are all very nice!)   The food is pretty good. Especially if you are looking for something late and actually good. I've had the nachos which are big enough for 4 people to share. I've also had the salmon very tasty not 5 star but it's a bar so ya.   Ultimately this is a great place for people who like quite lounges with live music and a fun environment, don't expect too much from the bar just a cool place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for early evening drinks. The ambiance of the place is great! Very swanky in red and black. The location is nice too, it seems an odd place for a lounge but I like it. I don't have to go to the strip or downtown to get that little bit of extra over your regular neighborhood bar.   It's pretty mellow and quite enough to have a conversation, which is a rare find for a bar! But on my most recent visit last night (a Friday night) it was getting a little loud with a band setting up. Nevertheless the vibe is what sells me on this place. I'm heading there again tonight for a 1st date. Hopefully the Saturday night vibe doesn't kill the chill lounge vibe.   Lastly, on the menu, this is why it only gets 3 stars. I haven't eaten much here but nibbled on a few fries, or the like, from others plates. I don't remember  finding much for vegetarian options. They seem limited to the pretzel bites, make your own pizza, or a veggie burger. They don't even have a vegetarian salad, how odd is that? It's a SALAD. You're supposed to be focusing on the veggies in that case. Pretty boring in my opinion. Asking for subtractions or substitutions is a pain but if your diet is other than avid carnivore you'll need to be that person here. Friends that are carnivores say the food is good though."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to elixir for dinner and drinks since they opened. The atmosphere is amazing and the staff is so personable! We love coming in and seeing Coleen her smile and charisma is infectious! You can't go wrong with the food. Hint: have the stuffed mushrooms they will change your life!!! They have a great Sunday brunch. That is mine and my husbands go to during football season."}
{"text":"Best turkey burger in town. Excellent salmon. Service was very, very good. Excellent appetizer of baked Brie."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice & both times it hasn't been busy. Once late @ night on a weekend & once during the evening on the weekend. I recently went to host a Meetup for their advertised Ladies Night posted on their website. Well when I got to the bar I inquired about it to the male, hyper bartender & he told me that they don't do that anymore & I informed him it's on their website.   So with no hesitation after I told him I have some girls coming in for it, he said they would honer the Ladies Night Specials. I was trying to ask the bartender a couple of other questions & he wasn't even fully listening to me as his answers proved this & every time I tried to talk to him he was running off & yelling loudly back at me. The bar was not busy @ all, so it's not like I was taking him away from others.   So I went into the dinning room area & got a table & slowly others showed up for my group. We had an AWESOME waitress who was very attentive to all of us, knew everyone's name & allowed us to have separate checks. Midge was her name ? I'm not spelling it right...sorry :-(  I gotta say the food isn't good. I ordered a cheeseburger & it tasted horrible. It had this weird taste to it & I asked to have it cooked Medium & it came out Medium well. I didn't want to complain because I had to send back my garlic knots that came out 1/2 cooked & still doughy prior to this. These weren't that tasty either.   I think I'd rather spend my money on the drinks here! It's a good size & great price!  lol The ambiance is so pretty! Red & black colors & the decor is fabulous.   I def. would come back for drinks but skip the food!   Its def. worth checking out. It's kinda hidden too, up on a hill off a main road. People in my group had trouble finding it & I'm wondering if thats why its not always busy..... because people don't know its there???"}
{"text":"We looked online at the menu and everything made our mouths water. When we walked in the place is a very cool atmosphere. As we went up to the bar Pat the bartender greeted us as old friends with a big wonderful smile making us feel right at home... in some situations better than at home! We took a booth and ordered the elixir pasta and fish n chips both meals were amazing and as we ate we were talking about Pat because he is so positive and helpful we were like Pat gets 20 stars out of 10!!! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I was so grateful when I saw Elixir opened across from my business 4 years ago. From the first day I went in, to now I have yet to be disappointed. In fact, I have head my company Christmas party there for the last 3 years. Teresa always makes the entire experience special and extremely convenient and affordable for me. The entire staff is very attentive and personable. For my birthday Coleen went out of her way to plan a celebration. She had balloons, a cake, presents, and invited my friends and family to Elixir for a party. I have been in with clients for lunch several times and the Erin, Coleen, Brandon, and Pat always treat me and my clients like VIP. When I come in to relax after work Tony makes sure I always have a full drink and great conversation. I love the food, staff, and atmosphere, do yourself a huge favor and visit this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have never been disappointed with the food. Everything is always made fresh and comes out hot.  The staff and owner are very friendly and professional.  I definitely recommend the ahi tuna.  There is a typical Las Vegas bar with the gaming in the middle.  All the bartenders know their drinks and are happy to help. I will be back."}
{"text":"Shout out to Tony, Britney and Theresa plus all the other staff at Elixir. Everyone is helpful and friendly. Last night my husband and I ordered the crab balls and the meatballs and both tasted great. The games seem to be paying out really well right now, too. Husband and I came on opening night, I came back on Sunday and then Husband and I went back again last night. The staff really make the place but it is also a really pretty space and I didn't notice a smell of smoke anywhere. We are not smokers."}
{"text":"Been here once or twice a year and consistently unacceptable service as well as overpriced. Strip prices at a trashy local bar. My recent visit will be my last. I thought after a long day Christmas shopping last week I'd stop in with my lady for a happy hour beverage before going home. I had them remake our drinks because they tasted like lime water, all she did was add sugar to it while muttering something rude about me. I watched her. Now tasted like sugar water. Wow. What an awful experience. The appetizer was ok. I do not recommend this place. Also in a previous visit I ordered a couple champagnes with a friend and after ten mins I left. Service is terrible. I can much more easily go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is truly fantastic, the service is very good, and the food is great. My only issues were minor involving the food execution. The vegetables were undercooked and the salmon had too much pepper, but it was still delicious and worth eating again. The homemade chicken fingers and beer cheese and bacon soup were to die for! Also, I wish there were a few more cocktail options on the menu. Other than that, my husband and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. My only complaint is the staff makes it too hard to leave! Most fun bar in green valley. Try the Cobb salad... It's the bomb."}
{"text":"Great Service!!!! Good Food and nice atmosphere.  A great local place!!! All the bar tenders and staff are great at this place!!!"}
{"text":"Elixir provides everything that a local lounge should. A comfortable, classy environment with a friendly atmosphere. The food far outperforms the prices. I find the burgers and fish n chips to be exceptional. The best part of the bar, however, is Pat (the graveyard bartender.) Pat is probably the most friendly guy from Philly you will ever meet. He creates a welcoming and exciting environment every night whether there are 5 or 50 people in the bar. Don't let the happy go lucky persona fool you, Pat is a legitimate professional bartender. His cocktail knowledge and execution give the bar everything it could need. If late night lounges are your thing, Elixir is your place."}
{"text":"This place is in a business park that is a bit hidden but once you step inside, the decor is awesome! It has old school style tile and chandeliers on the ceiling over the bar. The theme is a sexy lounge bathed in red with plush booths, boutique wallpaper and a small stage for bands. The gaming is good and my bartender Coleen(CO-Leen) was very hospitable. The food was great. I had their famous mashed potato bites and the recently added \"jalapeño popper\" burger. The bites were fried but were not greasy, but light and fresh rather with piping hot cheese oozing from the center of the mash potato filled bite. The burger was savory and cooked exactly as I ordered. Overall, I will definitely be back to try more of there delicious creations and enjoy the ambiance."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar and restaurant. Food is excellent and reasonably priced. Staff is attentive and friendly. I definitely recommend the prime rib on Friday nights!  Good Happy Hour menu as well."}
{"text":"The inside is beautiful, very classy. Good drinks, music wasn't bad and the staff was very friendly. I haven't had the chance to order any food, but when the food is brought out for other people it always looks and smells phenomenal."}
{"text":"Wen we first pulled up we weren't sure about it. The location seemed to be a bit hidden and suspicious. However, it was amazing. The decor is excellent, they have poker on Tuesdays and live music on Friday and Saturday. Their food was excellent and super cheap (with appetizers, two meals, two alcoholic drinks, and an after dinner coffee our bill was 52.99). Our server, Amy, was fantastic. She had service that made us feel like we were in a fancy five star restaurant. Just the right mixture of business and casual. We loved it here and will return."}
{"text":"This is a great local place in Henderson. The food is amazing, they have great happy hour specials and they have fun events. The staff is really nice and helpful. The atmosphere is nothing like any other place in the area. It even has a little stage and they have live music on the weekends. What I like about this place the most is that you can go and have a drink and not be bombarded with gambling machines. They have machines, but if you want to go to another area without them and have a drink and listen to music, you can just sit in a comfy booth. I don't live far from this place and I go there all of the time because it is really the best place to go in Henderson."}
{"text":"Love elixir! Wish I lived closer, but always try to stop by when in the area. Try the chicken salad sandwich!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure this was the worst service I've ever experienced in Vegas. Ever. Did my dream of having the super power of invisibility come true? Because it sure felt like I was invisible the entire time I was here.  Upon sitting down, I was greeted within 5 mins. Ok. I was asked if I wanted a menu and I said yes. I received my beer and menu...and then boring. I sat there for over an hour. We finally got someone to come over after flagging them down. Not a good start.  And then our food order was poorly timed. And then we couldn't get anyone to close us out. I must have that power of invisibility. It's not like the bar was overly crowded. And the two bartenders seemed to hate each other. And they only liked to pay attention to the customers they knew (and those folks didn't get checks).  Here's a rundown of the food and drinks: - Beer offerings are alright. Mostly crap beers with a couple of decent ones. 3 stars - Whiskey Sour was impossibly weak. All ice and sour. 1 star  - Chipotle chicken nachos were huge, but mostly all chips. Chicken had a decent flavor. Salsa was meh. Guac was good. 2.5 stars - Wedge and steak salad was ok. Wedge salad part had ok enough flavors. Not much bacon on it. The steak was really fatty and incredibly bland. 2 stars  - The stroganoff was the best dish. Meat was cheap and some of it fatty. But the flavors were good. And the pasta was cooked well. 3 stars  I really wanted to like this place. I'm close to it on a regular basis. But the service was so crappy. And the food just didn't overcome the crappy service. So while the decor and ambiance are nice, I won't be a regular. Maybe it's better if you sit at a table? Maybe it's better on a different night with different bartenders?"}
{"text":"Elixir is amazing!!!! The bartenders are easy to talk to and make you feel welcome. The general manager Teresa is great! The owner Cody was there and we just hung out and had a few drinks. This place is a diamond in the rough with great food, flowing drinks, and good conversation."}
{"text":"This was the perfect place to relax, be with good people and be in a quiet, non-obnoxious atmosphere.  Delicious food, impeccable specialty drinks, good service and gorgeous decor.  They call it \"a locals lounge\" and they couldn't have described it better.  It's a beautifully, hip space, off the strip, live music on Friday/Saturday, video poker, tons of sports on and a reasonable tab at the end!  Can't wait to go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"The avocado egg rolls are great, actually everything I've tried has been good. And I love that they have live music on the weekends. Also it's really beautiful inside."}
{"text":"My wife, the coupon queen, picked up a Groupon (I think it was) for Elixir, and the coupon worked. We loved the atmosphere, especially the red chandeliers. Actually, I recall being surprised by the atmosphere, because the building outside and even the location did not prepare me for such a complete and abrupt shift in theme. The tables and seating is comfortable and seems to be well thought out. The food was good and there was enough on the menu to have me want to return to try more. This isn't too far from the Galaxy Luxury Theater (LOVE IT) and would make for a great evening of dinner and a movie."}
{"text":"OMG it is my first time here tonight and it is amazing! I just moved in across the street and I couldn't be happier to find a new local bar to kick back out. Swing shift manager Tony is so welcoming and graveyard shift Brandon is the bomb as well. And you can play pool, too!  And lucky to have to hung out with Theresa, she's the GM. She is as beautiful as she is friendly! We can't wait to come back....Tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Elixir lounge is a bar that is located on the second floor of a business center. It is in a weird location, definitely not a place that you might stumble upon by accident and it might be difficult to find. I drove around the block twice before I actually found the place. My visit was on a Friday for an end of the year event for work.   We had an area reserved to ourselves and a table with appetizers. They had a set up with a taco bar, chips and salsa, quesadillas, and chicken fingers. Everything was delicious. We had a server who did a great job making sure everyone had a drink and kept the rounds coming.   Ambiance was interesting. Maybe it was because it was the time of the day, but there wasn't much of a crowd. A few business men here and there who looked like they just got off of work. The red velvet walls and the black out curtains makes one think that this place gets down. There's a pool table and video poker.   I am not sure if my visit was during happy hour or maybe it was event pricing but I thought our drinks were decently priced. My beer and tequila shot came out to about $11 bucks before tip."}
{"text":"I am never on this side of town but I just so happen to be yesterday. My friend and I got hungry so we searched for places on the yelp app. Found this one and decided to check it out. I read a couple reviews before coming and was determined to get the corned beef and cabbage (since it was at paddys day). The person that wrote the review said the cabbage was not overly soggy like most other places so I was hoping for that but was disappointed when my meal came out. Not only was the cabbage soggy, but so were the carrots and potatoes! I wasn't happy about this. They also had a $3 Irish car bomb or $3 pint of Guinness special going on the day so I ordered a Guinness. I was surprised when it came out... In a can, with a glass. Guinness is a pretty popular drink! Why do they not have this on tap? Would have been so much better but it was only $3. No big deal.  After finishing the meal and our drinks, I felt this place deserved around a 4-5 star rating. My view totally changed after getting the check. I handed our waitress my CC and she took off to close out the transaction. We kept waiting and waiting for her to come back. She was busy tending to a couple other tables around the restaurant so I figured we should keep waiting. 20 minutes went by and I still have yet to see my card or receipt come back so I could sign. We finally got their attention and as it turns out... They forgot!!!! How incredibly annoying. It wasn't even busy as there were only two other tables in the dining area.  Overall, this place is alright. The atmosphere is amazing. I loved all their decor. Totally looks like a fancy cocktail bar. Service could be a lot better!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with babe.   Shes been here before but wanted to take me there for my first time. Its right by her work and said that they have really good food.  We ordered the chicken wings, stuffed mushrooms and fries. Chicken wings were really good nice and crispy. We usually prefer the sauce on the side so the wings dont become soggy. The stuffed mushrooms omg really good, but i think i can make them better. lol. And fres you know fries are always a must. But the food was really good.   Its really nice inside it reminds me of Burlesque the movie. Really intimate and sexy. Its kind of hard to find the place since its like in a corporate area but try this place. Its really good and the waitresses are really sweet."}
{"text":"So I live right next to this place, I mean right next to it. So of course i tried it. I have been coming here for months now and I can tell you honestly this place rocks. Their staff is super awesome and down to earth. If your a Vegas local and just want to get away from all the hustle and bustle but still interact with people, this is the place to be. Great service, FANTASTIC FOOD, and a super awesome atmosphere! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I was invited to a meeting at the upstairs party room. The noise coming from downstairs was way too loud considering it was mid day. We were only separated from the downstairs by a heavy curtain. Also needs a paint job..lots of scuff marks and leftover tape or something on the walls.  Service was good. Food was just ok. I'd eat here again of someone invited me but it's definitely not my first choice."}
{"text":"Wow...just wow.  I have known of Elixir for about a year and hesitated to try it out for dinner because it was a \"lounge\".  Big mistake.  From the moment we walked in to the plush, nicely decorated and spacious environment, I had high hopes...and was not in the least disappointed.  Frankly, when I looked at the menu I was a bit worried that they were not charging enough for the food to be good...yes, the prices are that low.  I ordered the Salmon Risoto and my wife had a chicken dish, both of which were first rate deliciously awesome.  Top that off with one of the better salads I've had at any restaurant and you can count us as happy campers.  Although it certainly is a \"lounge\", as in bar, the tables and booths are plentiful and spacious.  There was live music being performed at the perfect volume.  I found the other clientele to be a cut above average, as was the wait staff - and by demonstration, the kitchen staff.  We were already plotting our return to Elixir half way through our visit and decided it would be a great place to come back to for dinner, drinks, hanging out, taking friends or for any reason at all.  In short, I loved Elixir and wish I'd tried it out sooner!"}
{"text":"Came in for a cocktail and to throw a little money into the machine after a concert. It was 1 am, so it took a little time to find the door that was not bolted shut (it's the door on the north side, FYI).   Walked in, and it was a pretty good vibe... music, full menu available, and Andy the bartender did a great job introducing the players cards and the menu.  There was a big group of drunkards doing shots and being loud at the end of the bar-- someone's birthday I guess-- and the drunk chicks of the group were acting afool. It got obnoxious because they were so loud and foul, but I didn't stay long.   Drinks are good. Andy was attentive and a kept my drink full. All in all, not a bad experience. :)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch and so far, so good Elixir.  The food was good and the service was even better.   Thank you Amy!!  We will have to give it a try at night . . specially on the weekend when they have live acoustic music.  The atmosphere is great and I look forward to you opening up the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. The waitress was very nice, but gave a little attitude when I mentioned that my steak tacos were a little to fatty. Also I suggest they filter their water better since it has a bad taste. Over all the experience was good, I would go back."}
{"text":"You have to try the same juice and the angel hair pasta! So good! Best local lounge to hang out at."}
{"text":"Just went last night for the first time.  Nice decor.  Great server, but sadly didn't get her name.  Food was yummy (mashed potato bites and street tacos...both delish), good drinks (elixir and elixir margarita), service was super quick!  Guitar player/singer was fun to listen to and very talented.   Not very many people there...hopefully it picks up as I think this is a newer business.  Cool local place....check it out!"}
{"text":"Last night I ate at Elixir for the second time, and once again I was wowed by the service from our waitress.  She was very attentive and cheerful, she seemed like she actually liked her job.    For a starter we had the mash potato bites, which were pretty good, if not a little weird.  The Elixir chicken sandwich was amazing, so much flavor, as well as the chicken quesadilla. Oh and the spinach artichoke dip was great as well!  The ambiance of this place is very old Vegas, rich colors and heavy drapes.  Elegant with a sports bar element."}
{"text":"All ways a good stop for spirits or food, Good service"}
{"text":"Trying not to be harsh. No idea how the food is, walked in for lunch, sat at the bar and bartender ignored me for 10 min even while looking at me a few times.  No hello no menu no nothing. Very awkward. Left and no one said a word.  Other patrons all sittin around completely quiet."}
{"text":"Came here really late at night because my roommate and I were trying to find a bar with food and it easily became a favorite. The bar tender was awesome and attentive (forgot his name) and the food was honestly really good. The whole set up was black and red and had an old vampire feel to it. I loved it. Definitely want to go back."}
{"text":"A hidden treasure that more people need to discover. Have only been a handful of times, but each time the food & service (and cocktails!) are pretty dang impeccable. Most recently I had the Santa Fe Turkey Melt (kind of a slightly more upscale version of a fave sandwich I get at T-Birds) and opted for a salad as the side - very \"healthy\" and not some lame iceberg lettuce & carrot shavings deal."}
{"text":"Great place for locals. Comfortable atmosphere with big T.V.s, the staff was friendly and attentive. I would return to watch a football game or even have a casual girls night. I only give it a 4 out of 5 cause it was dead, and would have been more fun with more people. I will be going again!"}
{"text":"Just an awesome all-around experience. Beautiful burgundy and black dining room, with thirty foot or so ceilings and gorgeous curtains and chandeliers - Elixir has an incredible ambience. The booth seating if extremely comfortable too. The food is not only very tasty, but well-presented, and severely underpriced. The French Onion soup is well worth the $1.50 upcharge, and I was pleasantly surprised by the Fish and Chips I was craving. My first time here, but if the rest of the servers are even half as personable and attentive as Chelsea was, you are in for being well taken care of. I can't wait to head back and try the rest of the menu items!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a local bar with great food and service this is the place to be! Elixir a hidden gem, with a great atmosphere. Tony and Theresa (the swing shift bartenders) are always awesome!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of Elixir. It's where old Vegas meets new Vegas. It's hidden, so that's difficult for people who aren't familiar to find. Hey, more for me. Actually, it's in an old office building, you can see it from the road, however...it is off the beaten path. It's dark, black, and red. I love it. My servers have always been top notch. Midge, Tracey, and Chelsea seriously are the most nice and genuine waitresses I have met in a long time. Comfy chairs line the stage and if you get there early, you are always guaranteed a good seat. I have been there three times now and have brought people from out of town, as I love to claim Elixir as my cool hidden hideout. Drinks are reasonably priced and if you are lucky enough, hit up happy hour from 3pm to 6pm. The spinach dip is always my favorite. The portions are huge. My only compliant is that I wish the food was just a bit better. The ideas are awesome however the execution just isn't 100% yet. I've ajd appetizers, entrees, and desserts, and it's across the board. I overlook that for the drinks and service. Try the signature martini if you like a drink that will make your mouth pucker. The dirty martinis are fabulous. And they have a decent wine selection. So...maybe I'm partial. I am all in on this one. I hope they stay for a long time. It's everything I want in a bar. If you want to game, they have video poker at the bar and numerous flat screen TVs. The music is awesome with its eclectic selection. If you get the chance, check their website for when Patrick Genovese is there on a Friday or Saturday night. He is a phenomenal, and I mean knock your socks off, singer and guitar player. Mind blown. You can go in casual, but feel high class. It's worth it to check it out."}
{"text":"Love this place Theresa and Dane are wonderful the food and drinks are on point. It's a place you can truly relax and feel comfortable.  The food is just as good as the drinks especially the avocado egg rolls and the bacon blue  cheese burger"}
{"text":"Elixir of...... love?  Not quite, but I will say I was smitten with this place when I first walked in.  The location may throw you a bit, like it when a friend and I decided to try it, but once you walk in you instantly feel a part of the awesome ambiance.  The decor and furnishings all add to create this cool vibe that just makes you feel chill.  We only went for drinks and I really enjoy their happy hour prices!  I was a little upset their tap was broken because I tend to prefer beers on tap than bottled beers, but they had a great selection to choose from so I was still able to satisfy my thirst.  I was extremely happy they were playing the Women's World Cup game and they even had a huge projector style screen at the other end of the bar for big screen viewing.    We were only passing through before heading to catch a movie, so we only had time for drinks, but the food we saw people eating looked and smelled delicious.  I can't wait to go back and actually try it.  We may have only been passing through, but we will definitely be back and I will definitely update my review when checking the place out for a little longer.    Another thing I noticed is they do an industry night, which is just awesome!! Great atmosphere!  4 stars for now... maybe it'll hit five after I try the food!"}
{"text":"Mitch is literally the GREATEST!!!! Great service, drinks and atmosphere, I don't like bars too much, but this one is the S#%t!!!!"}
{"text":"In town visiting a friend, we happened to choose Elixir. Wonderful decor and atmosphere. The restrooms were immaculate clean and the fish tacos were amazing. However, the best part of this establishment was our bartender. Pat, on the graveyard shift, was very welcoming. Seemed like an old friend within minutes. Professional, attentive, and just fun. Because of Pat, our trip inside went from a couple of drinks and dinner to an epic all night event. I will definitely visit again when I'm in town and highly recommend everyone going during the graveyard shift went Pat is working."}
{"text":"My new spot in Henderson! Excellent service actually get what you order unlike other places in the area. I hope this low key spot is around forever! I'll be back soon! Last night was the most fun I've had in awhile!"}
{"text":"I came in here expecting a bit more then what I got but over all service made up for it just plan on taking a elevator to get in. They could use a more complex cocktail menu since the name of the lounge is Elixir."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in the staff was very welcoming.  The bartender offered me some water while I waited for my grieves to get there.  The decor was really cool with the red chandeliers and dark accents. There was a nice variety of happy hour drinks & small bites.  The wait staff was very attentive and I enjoyed my dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. I didn't eat but my friends all enjoyed their meals which included the meatball trio, bacon avocado chicken sandwich,  and pepperoni pizza. My only complaint was that it was very smokey inside the lounge."}
{"text":"Our current favorite local bar. Love the red and black decor, I kind of feel like I'm in a scene of scarface. I love everything from the menus to the awesome bar staff. Shout out to my fave Tony! He always takes such great care of us. Food wise we've had the poached salmon salad (fave) chicken wings, chicken roulenade, and a few of the salads. All amazing. I highly suggest this bar to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, also it's available 24/7! The special on tap and the paradise crush martini were both so good. Bartender Tony was super friendly and knowledgable. Over all had a great experience and they have a rewards program. Interior is all red and black- pretty cute."}
{"text":"Nice little getaway lunch spot hidden in an office plaza. Good food and drinks. Really like the interior and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love this place! My awesome wife found this lounge on Yelp and recommend that we give it a try. We stopped by there this evening and immediately were welcomed by the friendly bartender, Anthony, and waitress, Ariel, which both did and outstanding job: attentive, courteous, fun, and hospitable.   We had a few drinks while playing video poker, then ordered some food. My wife had a chicken salad and I had broiled salmon, while we both shared some Buffalo Shrimp. The food was prepared as requested and very flavorful.   The highlight of the evening where my big wins playing video poker, Deuces Wild, betting max. I had several big wins and hit 4 Deuces and won 1000! Image attached.   To make the night even better, we were comped the  salmon dinner, as it was our first time there and they wanted to show gratitude to us visiting. Good business sense on the bartender as we will definitely return.   Highly recommended place with a chill atmosphere and great staff!"}
{"text":"A shi-shi sports bar with an appetizing menu executed in a very average manner.    The current tenants of this space (previously Daddy Macs, and Blue Wave before that) have stuck with the existing deep red on black decor and subdued lighting. Very Victorian. It harkens back to the supper clubs of the olden days. I half expect to find gentlemen in top hats when I entered the door. Instead I only found a few mid-day drinkers playing video poker.  Being a sports bar, of course there are wide-screens all over the shop, which seem a bit anachronistic given that the place is swathed in late 19th-century red velvet drapery.  Interestingly, the owners have placed a few old-fashioned items on the menu, such as baked brie, which are juxtaposed with more modern tasters, such as the deep-fried mashed potato bites. The menu is fairly enticing.  Sadly the food falls short. It feels like everything here is made to sound impressive, but, looks and tastes like it was cooked at Wendy's. I would have assumed it was all fresh-made, but it all tastes to me like it originated in the freezer.  Today, I tried the Chicken Florentine Soup. It definitely came from a can.  No doubt about it. Then I got a California Turkey Burger.  The lettuce was limp, the avocado was almost non-existent, and the turkey patty was too salty.  However, there was a nice char on the patty, and I do love grill marks.  My main complaint is that this swanky restaurant has tremendous potential and no one here seems to know how to reach it.  The menu was promising. The descriptions of each item got me salivating.  Unfortunately, my dining experience turned out to be like a bad blind date:  your friend tells you how great this hamburger is, and then you finally meet it... and it is nothing compared to the burger you tasted in your dreams.  My advice to Elixir: if you're going to do gourmet pub food, actually do gourmet pub food.  It's just not right to titillate a person's tongue without bringing the taste buds to climax; wink, wink."}
{"text":"Nice bar with a decent menu located near my work. I have stopped in a few times for lunch with some coworkers. Items are reasonably priced and the food id good. I have gotten the steak and eggs a few times, the steak is seasoned perfectly and doesn't disappoint. Service is decent as well. This place sits back off the main street a bit and if I didn't know about I may have passed it. Give Elixir a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Beautiful place the lifting and ambience when you walk in is WOW! The smoke cloud that hits you is another story!!eeek if you smoke and sit at bar you are in great company! I found a space on the other side that wasn't as bad. I ordered  salmon it was greatttt but the asparagus and rice yuk!!!! I ordered Cadillac margarita ummmm nope I changed to an IPA  beer perfect! Overall cool place I think!"}
{"text":"As a local it's hard to find a great bar with consistency in excellent service. EVERYTIME I've been here it's been a please and an amazing time. You truly feel comfortable and the bartenders Tony And Pat are some of the best bartenders I've seen and actually get to know you on a name to name basis. The food is to die for ! Always ask for the special for that day!"}
{"text":"My cousins 30th bday dinner was Saturday night at Elixir...I had read multiple positive reviews and figured all would go off without any hitches....WRONG.  From the second we walked in I was kind of put off...the hostess/waitress was sitting at a hi top table with a patron eating his french fries. She proceeded to seat us and treated us as though we had interrupted her effing meal.  It only got worse. Now let me tell you, I am very much a go with the flow type of personality. I have learned not to expect too much because you will constantly end up disappointed. That being said, our server was not only incompetent, but, had a stank ass attitude to go along with her ineptitude. After we placed our orders she proceeded to clear the table of menus, as she was doing this she dropped the menus and loudly said \"god d*** it!\" Listen I'm no holy roller, but, that shite was uncalled for.  The food was brought to our table in no particular order and we were given the task of sorting which meal went to which seat. I had ordered the Philly cheesesteak sandwich, which by now I'm sure you have guessed did not even show up with the rest of the food. So as our sourpuss server comes by again, I asked if my meal would be out shortly, to which she replied what did you order again? I told her I had ordered a  Philly cheesesteak and she in a irritated manner said \"okay, I will let the kitchen know you want ANOTHER cheesesteak sandwich.\" She made it sound like I never ordered anything to eat in the first place. I sat there for a second and thought to myself \"I don't want ANOTHER cheesesteak sandwich, I want the one that I ordered 20 minutes ago!\" In conclusion I want to be fair to this joint and let everyone know that the food I actually ate was pretty good,but, the service sucked gonads."}
{"text":"Alright. So to start it off, I asked the bartender pat to make me a shot that was tasty and not too strong tasting... He definitely did not disappoint. . I love the vibe here and the avocado rolls are super good! Next time im in Vegas im bringing my brother!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Hawaiian food, entertainment and just wanna kick back and have a few, well look no further than Elixir Bar and Lounge, where they bring Hawaii to Las Vegas, Big Mahalo goes out to Bruddah Cody for welcoming my wife and I to this Place!!! I will DEFINITELY come back"}
{"text":"We haven't been back for about 6 months and let me tell you i love it. New owners. Great pinball and shuffleboard. Great atmosphere. For s is a little pricey but the service is top notch. So friendly. Tony is the bomb. I can't express how much I appreciate his service. So kind."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good - kinda fancy American style.  I was really excited about the location because it's kinda on a hill with this huge patio upstairs. Unfortunately, they closed the patio and put curtains over all the windows! What?!!?? I would have loved to come here and sit in the patio, enjoying the view and weather with a drink. I guess they're more focused on the gaming. Too bad because what could be a cool neighborhood bar is now just a pts with a red interior. Oh and to top it all off, it's smoky as hell inside. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good food excellent service planning on coming back. Great place for both men and woman a feminine side with chandeliers and sports shows for the guysThey also have live music at 8 pm and go on Groupon for fantastic deals 20.00 dollars 2 entrée s and an appetizer. Easy parking. Our waitress Tracy was friendly competent knowledgeable knew how to use the Groupon deal"}
{"text":"Good on a football Sunday. The servers were really friendly and remembered our names when we left. Machine play was nice, got a free $20 to play (even though you had to bet at least 50 cents a play).   Drinks were good, had a bottomless mimosas and bottomless bloody marys for brunch for only ten dollars. I had draft Rebel IPA and Magic Hat #9, which was nice to have on draft.   The beer bacon and cheese soup was excellent. The Sunday specials not so much. Deviled eggs were fine, chicken fingers were fine as well, but the \"angus\" sliders were garbage. The bun was dry and flaky and the meat was mcdonald quality. The fries were a bit bland too, but the specials were really cheap so it wasn't bad.  The real positive is how nice the place is. Plenty of TVs to watch games, plenty of incentives to play the video machines, the bartenders were nice and the place was pretty friendly. Definitely a nice place to watch some games or to hang out for a drink."}
{"text":"Pretty chill lounge. Liked the music selection & the pool tables. Bartenders were nice"}
{"text":"Fantastic local bar!! Coleen on day shift is an amazing bartender. She is the epitome of a great local bartender. The food is fantastic too!!"}
{"text":"Really good food, warm atmosphere, clean, and a great sever! Caprese sandwich and salmon with mushroom risotto were delicious with quality, tasty ingredients. Server was very knowledgable about beer and provided good service."}
{"text":"Lounge/restaurant in the Las Vegas suburbs.  We came here for a late dinner one night. There is smoking allowed in the restaurant which was disappointing.  I'm not sure what was going on with the bar on this night but either they were out of ingredients and/or the bartender did not know how to make simple drinks.  For our meal we split a bunch of different appetizers. The avocado egg rolls were good.  Friendly waitress but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We have been in a few times for dinner and drinks since they open. The service has been great... They have friendly and helpful servers. The food is just short of amazing.   It is more a \"lounge\" and less a bar.. As drinks, martinis, manhattans and such are outstanding...  Beer is .. eh. They only have like 4 beers on tap, and bottles. Not that great a selection. But we come for the great drinks. So not an issue.  Over all a great local place to drink, eat and hang out."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE EVER!!   Let me just begin by saying that I drove with a family of 4 from southern California to enjoy a birthday dinner at this place. Because my husband & I are \"foodies\" of sorts and MUST know the quality of food & service at every restaurant we try. We had pretty high expectations of Elixir being that we saw an average of 4 stars out of 5 BEFORE trying this place. To try making this long story short... The employees were RUDE to say the least. Our server rolled her eyes and sighing at our large party for the time it took to order (as it would normally for a party of our size), cursed when dropping dishes, got our order wrong AND blamed it on US!! I just couldn't take it any longer. I complained to the manager but her solution was to pay for a round of drinks. Wasn't worth it!! We should've walked out the moment we walked in and had a nasty hostess/server speak to us with her mouth full of fries. Disgusting!! If service doesn't matter to you then you MIGHT be ok... If they get your order right."}
{"text":"obviously anyone who rated this lower than three or said they dropped the ball is a metal defective.  first: the place is decorated posh and over the top with the black and red, that is over the top good. from the red chandeliers to the black framed mirrors it screams amazing. the lighting is fantastic. the seating is comfortable. second: the service is out the door the best i have ever had. the waitress not only got everything from drinks to appetizers to the meal right but did it all with out writing a thing down. i have been places where the waitress writes it down and still gets it wrong. she was super friendly and even joked with us. (we can be rowdy).  third: the food was spectacular. i don't usually get appetizers but the ones we got were fantastic. stuffed mushrooms and mashed potato bites. the salad that came with the meal was plenty big, and it came with the meal, no if you want a salad its an extra 3 bucks like most places do now days. the portion sizes were good size and every thing tasted fantastic, not one complaint from a table of 5. i got the fish and chips and unlike most fish and chips where its all batter and no fish this was big chunks of fish lightly battered and tons of fries.  this place is a little hidden but GPS it. it was one of the best places i have been in a long time. when your tired of the olive gardens and outbacks, this place is fresh, beautiful, and well worth it."}
{"text":"Let me first start off saying this place is a good place however some items on the menu are awesome (corned beef) and some are not so awesome, Western Bacon Burger.  The menu says fresh ground beef which I believe it is but it is not an in house made burger patty.  You can tell when a patty is put together in house and from one purchased as an already made fresh ground patty.  I am not saying it was horrible because it was not, but I have had way better burgers at places I will share with you if interested if you contact me, I will not post names here and this burger was just ok.  It is something I can now say been there, done that.    Next time I will try something else I have not had here before and we will see.  Like I said in the beginning, the corned beef sandwich I had last time I was here was amazing.  The menu has a decent selection of foods and you should go there.  Please understand when it comes to the burger and this review, this is my personal opinion and feeling which means if you like burgers, give it a try and write a review with your opinion."}
{"text":"Elixir won me back over tonight. My husband and I had been getting food to go here a few times until we decided to go in one day and actually order food from the restaurant in person. I was impressed with the decor and the ambiance. However, I was very disappointed with the service. She was rude and she almost seem annoyed we were there bothering her. So I said I would never go back in again. From that point, I decided to continue to just call in my order because their food is good. I recommend the mashed potato bites as an appetizer. Unique and delicious. I get the California burger every time and its really good. My husband is the one who tries new things and tonight it was the beef stroganoff. He really liked it. He would prefer egg noodles on it and a bit more bread with it, but he still enjoyed it very much. He got a groupon, so that is why I agreed to go back in, watch the U of A game because they do have awesome and giant screens, but I was hesitant. Hesitant we would get the last server we got. Well, CHELSEA redeemed the last servers experience for me. She was a great server, attentive, sweet, and fast. When we go back in, I want her as our server because she's on top of it. Nothing like great customer service and great food, so for that reason I took time to write a review. We will be back."}
{"text":"Atrocious customer service. This is a place I used to visit occasionally. After tonight's visit, they've definitely lost my business."}
{"text":"On my recent trip home, we indulged in a grown-up family vacay in Vegas. My traveling companion was a long-time resident and, during our last trip through many months ago, I'd used the trusty Yelp toy to find a place close to where we were shopping to get vittles and game a while. The all-knowing yelpball sent us here, to Elixir.   It proved solid that first time so we returned. The interior is attractive and sexy. The dinner menu is varied, complex, and interesting...they also have live music on occasion which is a wonderful touch during dinner. This time, we stopped for a light(ish) lunch, drinks, and video poker.  The bartender was proficient, made a mean margarita, took our lunch order, checked back on us at appropriate intervals, and was not at all hard on the eyes...always a bonus. We shared a fried artichoke appetizer with a tasty, creamy dipping sauce, and a spicy grilled chicken sandwich. This mini meal hit the spot!  My only disappointment on this trip was the loud owner/manager at the bar...he was carrying on a heated business conversation better had in the office...he was also a little brusque with Missy McHotty behind the bar, not cool, but short-lived...otherwise this woulda been a 5-star visit.  After a full day of shopping, we enjoyed well- made cocktails in an intimate spot served by a friendly, capable bar keep. She kept us happy; we ate, drank, gamed, and walked out $172 richer. If you're in the vicinity, roll the dice...this place is a 'natural'."}
{"text":"Can't say anything bad about this place! Great food, fun gaming and they special order my beer! Yes we are regulars! Avocado egg rolls with jalapeño ranch and stuffed mushrooms are a couple of our favorite appetizers! Love the staff and and the ambiance!  I super am excited for football season to start up again. Good give aways, drink and food specials are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place on a Monday night for the first time.  We used my Groupon deal (1 appetizer and 2 entrees) that expired the following day.  The menu had a decent selection.  Not as big as the sister bar (Remedys) but there was enough options.    The decor is nice.  Red and black colors with velvet panels and curtains.  It definitely had a Frank Sinatra era feel.  Gorgeous red chandeliers and comfy plush chairs.    Our waitress, Chelsea, was GREAT! She educated us on the daily events that happen at Elixir and guided us on the menu.  She paced out our food order perfectly so we had time to enjoy each dish.   We ordered the chicken nachos. The marinated shredded chicken was delicious.  I like how they put the sour cream, guacamole and salsa on the side so it didn't make the chips soggy. They serve generous portions here for sure.  I had  the t-bone pork chop and my date had the seared beef medallions.  Both super delicious and the presentation was as if I was dining at a fancy restaurant on the strip! I was very surprised.  The side salad that came with the entree looked like an entree itself.  Big plate and the house salad was made of dark greens and not the typical romaine lettuce.    We will definitely come back to check out the weekly poker tournament, the live entertainment on Fridays and Saturdays and definitely the food.   The drinks.. I personally thought my vodka tonics were watered down.  My dates Long Islands were ok.  So I changed it up and had Jack Honey on the rocks since they do not serve Patron.  Thus, my reason for the 4 stars.   Great place overall and a much see!"}
{"text":"This place is located in a business center, had no idea this place was even here. The decor is awesome, sort of medieval/gothic. Bartender was nice. My only thing is that the smoke in here is awful and the drink selection is very limited, nothing too special. Didn't try the food. Oddly that the ppl in here seem to know each other, maybe employees and regulars? Who knows. If you want a very chill place then guess this place would be it, seems very calm, too chill for me."}
{"text":"First time in last night and very happy with what I discovered! The staff is amazing and so welcoming, along with the great atmosphere and ambiance in the entire bar! Decor is beautiful and I can't Wait to go back thank you Brandon, Tony and Theresa for a great night!! Consider me a regular now."}
{"text":"After reading great reviews, I decided to make reservations for 10 to celebrate a 30th birthday. I was completely disgusted with the service we received from the moment we walked in to the moment we left.   As soon as we walked in the waitress who sat us was hanging over a table eating french fries from a customers plate. She rudely asked if we were the party of 10 and brought us to our seats. When it came time to order the food the waitress (wish I got her name) was so rude it was unbelievable!! She rolled her eyes and huffed and puffed because it was a little loud and confusing with our big group. I don't care how big and loud we are, you DO NOT roll your eyes and pout like a baby to your customers. While she was picking up the menus she dropped them and said \"god damnit\" right behind us!   When our food came out it was up to us to figure out where the plates needed to go and we were missing an entrée. When we finally waved down the waitress she stated \"well I gave them the order there was just a lot of food\" so we decided to cancel the plate. Five minute later she drops it in front of us and says well the chef made so I wanted to give you the option to eat it.   That was the last straw, a member from our group found a manager and explained our complete disgust with our waitress. The manager claimed to be shocked and said she was her best waitress. If she is your best waitress then that might explain why your restaurant was dead on a Saturday night.  The manager did comp all of our drinks which was 71$ but still added the 18% gratuity and a service charge. I would have paid for my drinks instead of giving the waitress our money.     The waitresses are so concerned with catering to the 5 older regulars then the new business that is coming in. The sad part is the food was decent and the music was enjoyable they have so much potential but will not have repeat customers with those waitresses. If it wasn't for having such a big party on a Saturday night, we would have walked out upon arriving.   Decent food, good music, and the worst service I have ever experienced in Las Vegas! Wish they didn't have good food so I could give them 1 star."}
{"text":"Came by to grab a to go lunch.  Food was pretty great.  only reason this isn't a five star review is because I don't think they were ready for patrons when I showed up and it took a while to get served."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now, once with a group and once just 2 of us. Both times we had attentive servers. The decor is really cool and the place is pretty big. No shortage of seats, even for large parties. Last time we ordered food and the portions are huge! Waaaay too much food so really we could have shared a plate, but the sandwich I had and the soup  and sandwich my bf had were delicious. There is music from a jukebox I think but it's not too loud to talk. Also, the waitress told me on, Wednesdays I think she said, they use a room upstairs to hold one of those paint classes. So I'm looking forward to doing one of those sometime. We will definitely go back here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cool vibes, friendly staff makes you feel like family. The food was above average (I can recommend the prime rib French dip)  Highly recommend as a friendly place to hang out and enjoy.  If you haven't been there, go! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a funky place! No cookie-cutter ambience here, you don't notice it's stacked with tv's because it is red all over with dramatic chandeliers. Great date spot. I had the steak frites - awesome and reasonably priced. My server Whitney was very attentive. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place and there drink menu the atmosphere is very nice and the locals are welcoming. I will go again! Probably become a regular! Love bands on weekends!"}
{"text":"We had been here when it was Daddy Macs. We decided to go here again on a whim. My wife had purchased a restaurant.com certificate, which always seems to motivate us to try a place. The place is nice the decor had not changed too much from the Daddy Mac days. The food and the service were wonderful. Amy was our server. Along with being very proactive, she had answers to any questions we had about the food and the lounge in general. Again, the food was great with large portions at a reasonable price. It appeared that most if not all of the food was prepared fresh. The dinners all come with a soup or salad starter. We will definitely be going back to this one soon. They are a gambling tavern so minors are not allowed here."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely a great find....except for their bartender TONY.  He takes this place from 100 to 1.  A group of 4 of us arrived there with plenty of money to drink, gamble, and eat.  He was extremely rude to us and even stated it was because we weren't his regular customers.  Think twice before you go here, at least on Tony's shift.  Horrible service from him and completely made us feel unwelcome.  Ask for Kaylie, the server.  She was great and witnessed his rude and childish behavior."}
{"text":"This place was so great! Mike makes great drinks and is one of the best bartenders around!"}
{"text":"My first time in this little spot and I was so pleased by the experience. The atmosphere is rich & fancy, but the ambiance is laid back. With a little bit of live guitar playing in the background, me and my girls were able to catch a small table in the dining area. The server was polite and took very good care of us.   Their menu is full of variety from bar food to full delicious entrées. And the waitress mentioned that they have a chef 24/7 who prepares the food fresh daily. I only had a bowl of the French onion soup, but I found it to be delicious! And even had enough for left overs. My friend had a huge plate of nachos, which were good But certainly not the best I've had, one thing I like was that they made it with shredded chicken, que so fresco, & a freshly made guacamole.   The bar/restaurant is open 24/7, HH is everyday between 3 to 6 AM & PM, and breakfast is served ALL day. Drinks and food not priced too high at all average $4-$9 drinks and food average $$8-13$ That's pretty awesome. Overall, I will definitely come here again. Only downside is there are no games, pool table, darts or other side entertainment- just flat screen TV's and video poker play."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  It's hard to find a drama free bar but the staff at Elixcer had managed this nicely.  Some of the best food in Henderson.  Live music I  Friday and Saturday night.  The staff is incredibly friendly. One of the best bars in  town."}
{"text":"I really like this place, it's only been open 2 weeks as of now... So that being said they're doing a really good job!   They use big glasses! Which make you feel like you're getting your money's worth.  Everyone is super nice, welcoming, and accommodating so hopefully that won't change!  Best of all a great dirty vodka martini!"}
{"text":"Friday happy hour, maybe 8 people in there, most seemed like employees. Tight machines, bad service, plenty of better places to visit. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! You'd never think of it just driving by but it's incredibly nice on the inside and has this cool little balcony area with a killer food menu. I usually come in late at night around 2am for a night cap and when I get there it's always the greatest atmosphere and awesome music playing. Patty is usually the bartender when I come in and I couldn't ask for better service! He always has my drink ready and waiting for me before I even sit down. This has become my favorite bar to go to, mainly because of the staff! And I definitely recommend this place to everyone. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Tony, Teresa, Coco, and Brandon have the best customer service ever!!!! I live close by and this place is so awesome! Always feel welcome and at home with these fellas!!!!"}
{"text":"I live right by here so find myself stopping by out of convenience more than anything. Even still, after three chances, I'm afraid I will not be returning.  Bartenders are not very friendly nor attentive. Food is subpar at-best. I was hoping future visits would change my mind, but it seems to be a trend rather than an aberration. Too bad. It would be nice to have a regular spot within walking distance..."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect from Elixer.  Located in an odd corner of Henderson intermixed among apartments and a small office complex.  It seemed odd entering and having to take an elevator upstairs but it created an interesting mistique.  The staff was friendly and Teresa and Tony were very helpful learning the menu.  There was live music on Saturday on a small stage.  They have happy hour till 6 but I was late.  There is a nice selection of beers and well drinks.  I only ordered an appetizer, the mashed potato bites, which were heavenly.  I gambled a bit so my drinks were free (something I didn't know about bars because I never play at the bar).  I was up about 80 dollars but I felt terrible about it so I gambled until it was all gone.  All in all it was a nice few hours on a Saturday evening watching sports on the several TV's above the bar.    THERE IS ALSO A POOL TABLE!!!!!!!! and poker tournaments on Tuesday Nights."}
{"text":"Great drinks and the service is always on point.   Live music is always there in the evening.   Not a bad place to hang out!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Its not what you expect when you see it from the road because once you get inside, its a whole different feel. Everything is red. It looks like an old 1940s mob bar. Red velvet booths and chairs. The bar is red. Very cool look. But you don't go to places because they look cool.   The food is very cheaply priced but tatses expensive. Some of their meals and appetizers are so good that I ordered multiple plates. The fried mashed potato bites are probably the best thing I've eaten in Las Vegas, and I live here. The staff has always been friendly and accommodating. They're open 24/7 and have live music on certain nights. The music is always acoustic and dinner friendly, meaning you can have the music and still talk to the people at your table without shouting.    They are never overly busy, so you can get in quickly and have room for your party while not having the  atmosphere of a busier bar that plays loud music and is jam packed.   This place is a hidden gem of Henderson /  Las Vegas. Check it out."}
{"text":"Elixir looks a little strange from the outside, but don't let that stop you. Inside, it's a comfortable bar with great music, great food, and a great staff. The live music on Fridays and Saturdays is a fun change of pace. Check this place out if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is a local bar closest to my home. They have nice viewing for football games including one projection screen and some couches for relaxing and watching the game.  The bar is basically a square with gaming on all 4 sides. There's a pool table as well, although it looks a bit worn and needs new felt.   Its your standard bar food menu, with a few upgrades. I had the potato bacon soup last night and it was really delicious, with large chunks of both potato and bacon.   Definitely a regulars vibe here, as there were only 15 people in there for Monday Night Football. They did give away a couple jerseys so that's cool. I don't know how you get tickets to enter that though...maybe hitting 4 of a kinds. Very low key place.   Affiliated with Distill and Remedy's bars...players card or VIP gives you points on everything...gaming and food and drinks spent."}
{"text":"Went there today drooling for the brunch advertised and eggs Benedict.  However, the stench inside this \"joint\" was most unpleasant and not fit to eat in. NO barricade or separation between the bar and the food area. Do not recommend this place and would give it less than 1 star!"}
{"text":"Daytime 5 stars: Great atmosphere!  Service is great and food is awesome. You can go with a crowd or alone and always feel comfortable. Nighttime 0 stars (recently): lady Manager seems to just pay attention to the \"special\" male clientele, while the other of us have to wait.  If there are two behind the bar we all have to sit while the other bartender runs ragged. I waited to write this review until I was sure it wasn't just a 1 time occurrence. Once I was gambling and I waited 40 min without being asked if I would like another drink, so I walked out (there were 5 people in the place). I would really like this place to succeed so hopefully this review helps."}
{"text":"I have to modulate my rating a star because management has become more inflexible by taking its fine Beef Stroganoff dish off the menu, and refusing special requests for its preparation.  Nevertheless, after four dinner visits, I can now declare with some confidence that this establishment is still a great purveyor of other well-prepared comfort food.    For appetizers I sampled delightful mayonnaise-based Deviled Eggs with tiny Gherkins inserted in the whipped yolk, creamy Crab Bites with Chipotle Cream Sauce, and fine doughy Garlic Knots except for slightly burned bottoms.  Soup or salad is included with entrees.  On two occasions Albondigas Soup was a big hit, with celery, tomato, and just slightly spicy triangle-shaped meatballs dunked in a very tasty and hot broth.  French Onion Soup is very sound.  And the New England Clam Chowder I enjoyed here contained numerous pieces of clam, potatoes, and celery, and packed a nice spicy back bite.     Grilled Salmon with Citrus Butter was moist and  accompanied by excellent mid-sized Asparagus Spears and very good Rice Pilaf.  A generous serving of Fish & Chips presented me with three moist and tasty batons of deep-fried fish and an ample supply of tapered French Fries.  I saved one fish fillet and some potatoes for lunch the next day, where both fish and fries held up very well.  I also learned that Elixir handcrafts a superior-tasting Tartar Sauce and quite tasty Coleslaw..  Booth seating away from the bar is very comfortable here in a somewhat darkened romantic atmosphere, except one time piped in music was a little loud.  Service has always been excellent and attentive, although once Coleslaw was initially forgotten."}
{"text":"I had a good time playing Keno at the bar, i ordered the fish tacos and a blue moon. Perfect bar to just relax and have a fancy time. They usually have some kind of radio station host giving away free drinks also. Never had a problem here. :)"}
{"text":"I think this is a nice lounge bar with music  Always nice locals and a fabulous drink menu.  Only visited twice but I liked both times   Sometimes there's live music but the bartenders make it very fun   It's in a residential neighborhood which is verbfar off strip  Basically a local hangout  But you can't tell what's going on from Night to night There are private parties there a lot   Nice though"}
{"text":"I had one one the best old fashions I've had in a while. Street tacos were fantastic, great presentation as well. Service was good, cool atmosphere to relax and have a good drink with some good food. Would definitely recommend it, and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This place gets worse and worse each time I go. Today, my friend and I sit at a table. We noticed there is only one bartender so we sit at the bar.. The bartender (Brandon) still doesn't come over. He's with the guys next to us taking a shot!!! At least do your job before you start drinking on it! My friend finally asks for a drink menu and he says you must be talking about the happy hour menu and walks off... I eventually ordered a dirty martini and he makes it about 1/2 full... You'd think a liquored up bartender would at least give you a good pour! I paid $10 for the half full Tito's dirty martini and then we left!!!!   This place was great the first time I went but every time the menu gets smaller and the service worse.. Today's martini was my last straw!"}
