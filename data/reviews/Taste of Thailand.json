{"text":"Great place to dine :) definitely would return... love the stuffed chicken wings and cashew nut chickens . The restaurant has great decor ... great reminder of our trip to Thailand"}
{"text":"Unbelievably good Thai food. Correction the name is taste of Thailand!  If you haven't been yet- GO! If you love Thai food- it's very authentic down to the utensils  and the serving dishes- but most importantly the food is OUTTA THIS WORLD Awesome service- seriously could not have been better!"}
{"text":"Got a delivery via skipthedishes.ca The food was delivered within 30 mins. I ordered panang curry with tofu. It didnt match other thai restaurants I've been to. However, it was good enough to satiate my thai craving! The curry had good flavour of the lime leaves. It was a lil runny and could have been thicker."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food. We had it delivered by Skip the Dishes. It took a while to get to the house but when it arrived it was still quite hot and delicious. We had green curry chicken, pad thai, spring rolls, soup and coconut rice dessert. It was all fantastic. Will definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food, authentic decor, professional service, real aprons and cutlery, all at an amazing price. They have a great choice of Asian beers. Small and intimate. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place. It was good, not amazing but better than most Thai delivery options. Good flavours. However the portion size is very small for takeout/delivery. 2 grown men cant share two dishes and rice you would need 3 dishes - you can get better portion sizes at other Thai takeout/delivery places. Spending $30 on food you should be full after. If your someone who has a small appetite than this is a great place. The basil in the green curry really stood out nicely."}
{"text":"Finally decided to give this place a try since it's quite close to my apartment. My bf and I ordered the beef larb salad, basil chicken stir fry and BBQ lemongrass chicken. The dishes are flavorful but not too overwhelmingly oily. I can see myself ordering from here again as I am a big lover of Thai food and this place has a good price to portion ratio, giving me enough for lunch the next day :)"}
{"text":"Food is always really good!! I live right beside this place so I've ordered a few items off the menu and I've never been disappointed! All of the curry items are spot on. Portions are pretty big so if you're ordering for one it'll last 2 days!! This is my regular go to place for take out! Best Thai place in Calgary in my opinion"}
{"text":"The food was so good , friendly staff , reasonable price and close to downtown. The restaurant is small so most of the people order it thru SKIP. Most of all its good one to try some Thai food"}
{"text":"It's a a nice small restaurant that probably receives  more take out orders than has folks dining in. The restaurant is very nicely set up and gives a very authentic Thai feeling . They have the usual curries and the food was good in taste. I was quite please by the food. I was disappointed that they don't take Amex Cards for Payments  though."}
{"text":"Excellent service even though he was quite busy. Our beverages were always topped up. We ordered the dinner for 2 with the stuffed chicken wings as our appetizer on the side. The dinner for two was rather big. It can actually feed three people since we had some food to take home. Would definitely come back here for Thai in the near future."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place, they have excellent, really tasty Thai food - it is one of the best Thai restaurants we have been to. The customer service is really good and the food presentation is beautiful. They also have really good lunch specials."}
{"text":"I've had mostly excellent experiences here. Fish cakes are very tasty, perfectly cooked. I almost always get the beef basil and request extra spicy. It's great, reminiscent of the basil chicken that was at Ruan Thai when they were still open, which makes sense as there is a family connection with ToT. Good lunch specials, prompt friendly service."}
{"text":"We came here and tried the vegetarian set dinner ($38) for two, which I honestly think would feed 3 because I was bursting after the meal. The set dinner came with: vegetarian spring rolls, large coconut rice, green curry with basil, mixed vegetables with cashews, and coconut ice cream for dessert.   The spring rolls were pretty good, not overly greasy but, the menu said they would contain taro and I was really looking forward to it but, sadly, I was not able to detect any.   The green curry was a bit watery and the vegetables/tofu were a little sparse but the basil flavor was very good and there was actually a bit of spicy kick, which I think is rare! The mixed vegetables with cashews were good; I'm not sure what the flavour was exactly - maybe sweet/salty stir fry type sauce? I don't think I would reorder it but it wasnt bad. The coconut rice was maybe one of my favourite things. I know that is weird but I have never ordered coconut rice before because I didn't think I would taste the difference but it is amazing! I can never go back to the dark days before I discovered coconut rice. It's creamy and a little sweet but also light and goes perfectly with the other dishes.  When it came time for dessert, I could barely eat anymore but I still did (for science and not because I'm a glutton). It was surprisingly good with real coconut flakes in it and caramel sauce drizzled on top. Overall, I think this place is true to its name and offers a true taste of Thailand! Though, I would recommend fasting beforehand if you're going for a set menu."}
{"text":"For 5 people, we ordered the 4 person meal with an additional appetizer and green curry.   Everything is very well executed.  There was plenty of coconut rice to go around and feed 5 people comfortably.  All the dishes were colourful, flavourful and a good size for 4 people.  The basil beef was the most popular, as was the Red Curry.  They were nice enough to supply one more dessert for a fifth person even though it was a four-person meal.    The only complaint we have is that is was very cold in the restaurant, but we did go on one of the coldest days of the year...  Also, the service is excellent."}
{"text":"This place was so good. It was one of the first places I dined at when I moved to Calgary. Unfortunately I have had a very disappointing experience and have to share. They have a banner out front when they are closed that gives the impression they are like, CLOSED. As in closed down.  But I was scrolling through JustEat last Saturday night, and saw them. Score! Was so excited they were back up for business. Placed an order and waited for my confirmation email, as per JustEat's instructions. That email never came. So I call the restaurant. Over. and Over. No answer. 1.5 hours later I drove all the way down there and whaddya know--the place was dark and closed up, with the banner still out front. Tummy growling, I check my email to find JustEat had emailed me to tell me Taste of Thailand had rejected my order and that I wasn't charged. Except I had. Here we are 7 days later, and I am out $20. This restaurant should NOT be on meal apps and they can not just pick and choose when their hours are. JustEat informed me they have accepted numerous orders in the week after mine. But they were closed up on a Saturday night? Without stating this on their voicemail, on Google, on their storefront or putting their opening hours on JustEat, so it is not POSSIBLE to order a fake meal and pay for it?  Just unacceptable, guys. Really disappointed. Your food is fantastic but your business practices are deplorable.  UPDATE: it is 3.5 weeks later and I still do not have my money returned to me. JustEat says they have returned it, but they havent. What a pain this restaurant has caused."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed with our delivery meal from this restaurant. When you order something \"mild\" (an option on their Skip the Dishes menu), you have a reasonable expectation that the food will not have a layer of red chili oil floating on top. When we complained, we were told tough luck. It is not unreasonable to believe they'll fulfill their contract to deliver the food within the offered specifications, but they did not. If they're not really going to make the food to order, in this case \"mild\", then they should warn potential diners that mild means something else to them (hot). We will never eat the food from Taste of Thailand again, will actively tell friends about our bad experience, and leave bad reviews in all appropriate places. Don't take a chance here if you don't like scorching food."}
