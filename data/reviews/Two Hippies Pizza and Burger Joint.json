{"text":"Went there with a friend, everyone was friendly and it had a nice feel to it. Prices were dirt cheap as well. So why one star? The food. The pizza was really horrible, worse than school cafeteria pizza. Even the cheapest frozen pizza from the grocery store would be better. Plus when they wrapped the order to go they mashed tin foil down onto the pizza which may have been a favor since it took most the \"cheese\" with it when unwrapped.   I wouldn't ever go back, not even if the pizza was free."}
{"text":"A little out of the way, blink and you'll miss it kinda place but SO worth looking for and dropping by....Chef Bruno is this awesome french, fine dining chef who hung up his apron and traded it for some jeans and opened a Two Hippies franchise store. His recipes are all his own and come from his extensive travels all over the world- ask for his remoulade sauce- it is killer!   All the ingredients are fresh, he never uses frozen and you can taste the care and love he puts into each meal. The most shocking part is the price- you can get a giant slice (bascially half a 12\" pizza) and a drink for $2.50! This is a true deal!!  On the corner of Indian School and 24th street (kitty corner from Walgreens) this is a place well worth putting on the \"best kept secrets in central Phoenix\" list! Thanks to Chef Bruno for wanting to make good food for not much money and just having fun!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness this place is finally open! Their pizza pies are very yummy and the people working inside were friendly and helpful. It is also very cheap. While I only had their pizza, they also offer salads and sandwiches. I can't wait to keep going back here. Yay two hippies!"}
{"text":"Whoo! First to review!  I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this Two Hippies location since it is right around the corner from my house. We NEED some new life in the businesses on this stretch of 24th, and I really hope these guys make it.   There's nothing not to like: great pizza with creative toppings (I highly recommend the Pesto Chicken and the Mediterranean pizzas!), crisp crust that is chewy on the inside, and the pizzas are obviously lovingly crafted. And they aren't dripping with grease!  The best part is you get a 12\" pie for $7. It's a great deal. Visit Two Hippies and help get them off to a great start!  Bring cash, because they don't take cards (there is an ATM inside).   (OK, one teeny tiny complaint: there's no AC. That's not their fault, as the building doesn't seem to be equipped for it, but oh my goodness, it is going to get stifling in there...)"}
{"text":"It's official... that is the worst pizza in town.  I believe if you sold pizza like this in some cities like NY or Chicago you would be shot in a firing line or arrested.  When you even look at their pizza you know something is wrong... it even looks bad!    Sorry guys... you have very friendly service but you DON'T know pizza.  go back to something you do well... get high."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but their pizza is awful. It doesn't taste very good, and it looks worse than it tastes! I honestly could have made a better pizza at home.   Also, they don't have a menu online, which is an inconvenience. However, they are very friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty good place, small and parking can be an issue in this small strip shopping center. I do like their burgers, would recommend no doubt!!"}
