{"text":"Oh man am I glad Sam's is in the neighbourhood. Good and cheap. Free combos if you're a student! What? That's a deal. The fries are damned good and worth the extra buck. Sometimes they're undercooked and I eat them all anyway. The cheesesteaks are pretty good, but I prefer the chicken. The tacos are classy with slices of lime--especially the eggplant and cauliflower ones. They could use some salsa, but I eat 'em anyway. The burgers are fresh and tasty and the fish on a bun is pretty good too. No funny poops, so I keep going back."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak with onion, green pepper, mushroom, lettuce, tomato, mayo & cheese. Delicious! Not quite filling though.  Probably the size of a little league football.   If it was a NFL football... Now you'd be cookin' with peanut oil! Agree with the first review.  Small portion of fries. Can you hook a brother up?! But what can you expect for only a dollar more.   I ended up stuffing them into my sandwich.  Fries were good though.  Sorta like crispy fries from swiss chalet. For 9 dollars for lunch, price is about average for the downtown area.  I was still hungry after.  But then again, not many eat like me.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Well, it's passable, but \"I Went to Philly\" at Yonge and College makes a much better product. The steak here is tougher, isn't seasoned as well, and you cannot order the cheesesteak with just cheese and onions unless you specifically tell them to. Lettuce and tomatoes? Those don't belong in a cheesesteak!  It's about $2 cheaper than IWtP, but IWtP is superior."}
{"text":"I went there to grab a quick bite for lunch while I was at work.  The food was average, but will give it another shot as they have tacos and burgers in addition to there signature philly cheese steak.  It came with a free drink and fries, however the portion of fries was really small."}
