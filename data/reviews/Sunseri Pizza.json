{"text":"The pizza is solid. The red sauce here is better than the white. The breaded mushrooms are good too.   The pizza shop is a pretty small operation. I wish they had a better way to handle phone orders because calling over and over and getting the busy signal is annoying. Also, they don't take cards. This is really a bother. The first time I came here, I ordered more than $50 of food and had to drive to the closest gas station to get cash. Every business should take cards. These aren't $3 coffee shop transactions here."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza you'll find in the south hills! It's been perfectly made for decades, and tastes delicious! Not only that, their Italian and steak hoagies are great!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is where I have to travel to if I have a craving for a pizza with good sauce, cheese and delicious toppings. The meat to sauce to crust ratio was just right. I even ate the crust and I'm not usually a crust eater. The cheese blend was flavorful and complemented the sauce nicely. I'll be sure to go here when I visit my sister (it's right around the corner from her house). Appears to be a family owned business and I'm always down to support a family that is brave enough to work together."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible parking and not the friendliest staff ever. They DO NOT accept credit cards or any other payment except cash. This is written on the register but nowhere else. Keep this in mind, because if you show up with no cash after placing your order, you're pretty much screwed. It's also takeout or delivery only. No seating (there's no room), which means no restroom."}
{"text":"They Do Not Deliver To SouthSide Slopes.Which is 7 minutes away.The Reason \"we just dont deliver there\".....OK!!!!..."}
{"text":"Best Pizza! Their hoagies are pretty great too. My only complaint about Sunseri's is that they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"Horrible don't waste your time. It had no flavor whatsoever. I had to put my own oregano on the pizza because it just was like eating a piece of cardboard. It definitely is missing something. Don't waste your money coming here. TRUST ME!"}
{"text":"As with many food joints in Pittsburgh, this is a small family owned business. First time here and iv lived five minutes away for four years. Seems like these are always the best kind of places . Five stars for their italian hoagie alone; an immediate favorite. Will have to try their pizza next time for a more thorough review. Trust me, there will be a next time .."}
{"text":"The best breadsticks ever.  They are clearly house made based on the way they look, and have a great garlic parm taste.  I do not know how they make them so fresh and doughy, but they are amazing.  I have been ordering from here since high school and have never been disappointed.  The pizza, wings, and italian hoagies are also great options here.  They are cash only which is a little annoying, but the food is so good it's not a huge deal."}
{"text":"My family has been ordering there ever since I was a kid pretty well known place in Baldwin area great food good price only down fall they only take cash no card"}
{"text":"Family owned pizza shop that's a favorite for those in the south hills of Pittsburgh. The cheese blend is, in my opinion, what makes their pizza stand above the rest in the area. Great subs as well. Would definitely recommend ordering for pick up as delivery can be slow depending on the night."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian hoagie. If you're a fan of Danny's in the south hills...this is better."}
{"text":"Not good: Pizza is flavorless, sauce tastes like a can of tomato paste and the dough/crust is bland and too thick, bad texture. Chicken tenders were greasy..not sure why I trusted the good reviews, crappy dive in Baldwin, what was I thinking. Very bad to average, not worth it, tastes like every other crappy cheap pizza joint."}
{"text":"My wife has been gifted the heavenly goodness that are the breadsticks from Sunseri, and she said they were incredible, insisting we try the place. Now, I've seen this place when I passed through the neighborhood before, and thought \"that's the kind of place that would either be really good, or the kind of place you get food poisoning\". I never tried the it, since they're about 20 minutes away and in what seems like it could be a shady neighborhood(sorry if your a local). Well, she talked me into it last night, and I have to admit, I should have tried it back when I saw it the first time. We ordered the normal \"let's try this place\" large pepperoni, and the breadsticks that I've heard so much about. When I got there, I was pleasantly surprised by how clean it was. After the ride back home, we got down to business, the breadsticks (which are the most unique I've seen, and I've probably eaten more pizza than any other human) were just as good as she said, and worth the 40 minute round trip! The pizza was also really good, cooked not too crispy but done all the way through. I will absolutely go back to this place, probably enough to put the owners children through college. I would recommend this place to anyone interested in stuffing themselves full of tasty goodness, and not spending a ton of loot. (I spent under $20). The only thing that could be an issue is they only take cash."}
{"text":"Great hidden secret is Baldwin. Moved here 3 years ago, got pizza, hoagies, and fried apps for my friends and family who helped us move... Everyone loved the food! Now three years later my wife and I order from there at least once a month.   Great delivery service for a small charge but well worth the service.   Only down fall is the phone line gets backed up from time to time."}
{"text":"Sunseri's pizza is great. They have a medium thickness to their crust, perfect amount of sauce lots of cheese and multiple options for toppings. We order the cheese a lot for our son. My husband loves their sausage because it's not chunks but rather shredded and had a nice taste to it. Their breadsticks are awesome, twisted with garlic butter and cheese. Their hoagies are delicious and I personally love ordering a salad from here also."}
{"text":"I work at a school nearby and we order Sunseri's for the kids every time we have a pizza party. The pizza is great and the delivery time is fast. The customer service is great and they are always quick to give us extra coupons."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered delivery from this place and it was amazing! I live in Kansas now where good Pizza is hard to find so I was happy that she introduced me to this place. We ordered a large pepperoni and bacon pizza and I can't complain.  It was some of the best pizza i have had in a while. The prize was a little high for my liking---around $18--but it was a delicious pizza."}
