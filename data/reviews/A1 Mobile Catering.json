{"text":"Have you ever seen National Lampoon Senior Trip, when the fat guy only fantasy is finding the blonde haired Japanese woman of his dreams, and continues to miss her by a hair.   Well, this little lunch wagon is kind of like that for me, because  I see it on the road but it's always going the other direction.   Until that faithful day, when I was heading home, and seen the  A-1 truck turning into a construction site near my house,   I pulled a U-turn, and tracked this baby down.  I guess, the A1 insigna was always an eye catching emblem for this truck, but I heard from one of my construction working  friends that they made some pretty killer taco plates, and he wasn't wrong at all.  Unlike most of our hip hop food trucks that are very famous around town, this food truck is made for the working person, and it's menu is geared around lunch hour for 7-3 crowd.    There Hamburger, and a few other offering, but it's all about the tacos plates for this truck.   There tacos are about the same class of any street taco on E. Charleston during the evening; meaning there very good, and the rice was the basic Mexican rice, but the refried beans was out of this world!    I can't figure out what they seasoned their beans with but it was beyond addicting.     This truck is run by two Mexican woman, and their English is pretty good, but I can never find where there stopping next,  I got lucky one time, but Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....this truck is like that blonde haired Japanese woman."}

If you see this truck, you definitely must stop and try their food! The company is family owned, the owners are so professional and polite! You won't regret trying their food, they also cater to events so if you are looking for a professional well done service you must call them. Thank you A-1 for providing such great service to our city!"}
{"text":"#Vegas #Streetfood @LVAuction Saturdays 2245 N Nellis -A1 Mobile Catering  I love food trucks and of course in  #Vegas most of them serve up mexican food so it was no surprise A1 Catering was a taco truck. They have a warmer with several items already made so you can grab & go a torta,tacos,chimichangas,taquitos and ice cold drinks. The burgers and fries are made to order and so are the Tacos,Burritos and more.  The chimichangas were great--crispy a little greasy and full of spicy meat. The burger & fries NOT so good. Again Greasy BUT too greasy and the fries limp and saltless but the kid ate every last bite.  You gotta love the @CocaCola with sugar too!!! Long Live #vegas #streetfood"}
{"text":"If only the crispy chicken wrap had real chicken and real cheese. It was made of a spongy, processed chicken patty. The cheese was most likely processed cheese food. The sauce was good, but not good enough to mask the fake chicken and cheese. I'll stick with tacos from now on and they probably should as well!"}
