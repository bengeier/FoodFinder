{"text":"Disgusting lemon pepper wings! Super tangy. Couldn't stand to eat them. I asked her if the rice was fried rice she said yes. Well it was white rice! 
Service is horrible! Will not return."}
{"text":"Came in an hour before closing. Was told out of the burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs and wings the only thing they were serving is the wings cuz it was too close to closing. Also made it clear that they closed in an hour so we knew to be done by then! When the waitress brought our wings, since it was all we could order, she couldn't tell us which wings were which. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"The Honey BBQ wongs are the best here but I always call my odrder in and go pick it up as the wait is LONG lol..the service sucks waitresses are trashy and the place is usually not that clean but those wongs keep me coming back time after time.."}
{"text":"The best wings in Phoenix. We pretty much love all their food. The only bad thing is probably the service at times and those restrooms (smell like shit) all the time."}
{"text":"This is only place we eat wings at anymore. No comparison with several other places we've been at. Tasty, cooked right, and cost less that a fast food place to eat. Got plenty of great sauces. We get the Mango Habanero, and the Honey Sriracha. Seems like lots of take home people. We eat ours there. My wife happens to be a chef."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered burgers, I  got fries and he ordered chili cheese nachos. After a very long wait I got my fries and he got his burger. The burger was cold, fries lukewarm.  Husband finally went to counter to ask for the rest of our order. The other burger is cold and the nachos are wrong. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is Ok, but 3 times in a row I didn't get the burger I ordered. I almost think it's a race thing, I'm white."}
{"text":"Thanks to the manager and her kindness, this place receives a one star rating.  I never had an opportunity to eat here because my ordering process was interrupted by a large cockroach scampering across the floor and under a small refrigerator behind the counter.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"I had just returned from a two week trip to China, had no food in the house and I was hungry! The first thought that came into my mind was chicken wings! So i hurried over to Long Wongs to try their spicy teriyaki wings. The sauce was not too sweet and the wings were crispy when I got home to eat them. I would guess that the only difference between the spicy and the regular teri sauce was the sprinkling of chili flakes. Oh well, they were good none the less."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited over an hour for two dozen wings. Will NOT be back as this is the trend for most people that come here. Many people in here called in orders over the phone and have been waiting to pick them up for an hour. Would rate lower if possible. Save your time and money - go somewhere else."}
{"text":"As we walked in, we weren't acknowledged by any of the employees. Two of them were on their phone & the others were too busy having a conversation with each other. We sat at a table & the chairs had a lesther cushion but was all ripped off & barely sustainable. A table across from us that was joined by 3 other tables wasn't picked up the whole time we were there. There was a dj at the time & the music was just TOO loud. Our server didn't greet us until 15 minutes later & we had a difficult time ordering because she couldn't hear us. It was annoying that they wouldn't bother to ask the dj to lower the volume at least a bit. We ordered & got our drinks about a couple minutes later. Waiting another 15 mins or more we headed to the restroom & it looked like you had just walked into an abandoned highschool restroom. There was dirty toilet paper everywhere, cracked mirrors, and writings all over the walls and stalls. We walked back to our tables & paid for our drinks and left because the service and area was too horrible to sit and eat."}
{"text":"This place not only has Terrible food for the last few years but the owner and manager are awful people. They say horrible things to paying customers. They are the type of despicable human beings that interrupt funeral services to scream derogatory comments at grieving friends and family because there parking spots were being used. The owner writes reviews on his own place on Yelp to help his score. He is a flat out sociopath with no sympathy for anyone other then himself."}
{"text":"Not very good service I ordered a pick up and took over and hour to be ready I asked them how much longer they said 10 more min they didn't see your ticket ! While I waited the got other 2 orders wrong !"}
{"text":"Usually the place is dirtbag filthy. Today it was fairly clean. I called in my order today and the wait time was 30 minutes. So I got there 30 minutes later and they haven't even started my order! The place was empty. The hostess was just standing around when there was tables still dirty. The food was ok but the lack of hospitality turned me off. So Long, Long Wong Wings, I'm out!"}
{"text":"terrible customer service. i had to speak first the girl at the register didn't anything!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying NEVER AGAIN ! Walked out of this place after 15 min of no service . The place wasn't even busy at this time. Never will I be back to this place . Go to grandpa's pizza instead"}
{"text":"We were craving wings a few weeks ago and decided that this Long Wongs was the place to go.  Or, more likely that this was the only Long Wongs nearby and we were banking on the name of the establishment since other Long Wongs have some great food.  We walked in and immediately felt a bit icky by the dirty feel of the whole place.  We were so hungry that we went ahead and orderd two dozen wings from the girl at  the counter.  She appeared bored and unenthusiastic.  We found seats at a table and waited a LONG time for our order.  During this time of waiting, my eyes wandered around the dirty floor...the sticky table.....the drab furnishings.  We began to wonder if our order had been forgotten.  When we inquired about our food we were told that it would be ready soon and it was.  I think they made it when we asked.  The wings were just okay.  The whole experience was a let down and we will make sure to keep driving when we pass by this Long Wongs."}
{"text":"the fries: limp and greasy

the burger: dry and tasteless, like a cafeteria burger.

the wings: suicide sauce isn't suicidal, the wings themselves are the smallest  you can buy, and they definitely don't merit the raves I've heard.

the service: rude and cheapskate. I asked for more ketchup and she initially refused saying \"you have ketchup\". Yeah, 1 whole package of it. Hardly enough to taste (and the ketchup itself is lousy no-name stuff). I also asked for mayo for the burger. She initially refused saying \"we put mayo on already\". If there was any, I couldn't see or taste it. You can't have water unless you buy bottled. You can't use their restroom even though you're a paying customer. Noticing a theme here?"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 5 stars because I love the Honey BBQ wings!  The trick is to order ahead of time. They are always super busy especially on weekends! I usually order 30 to 45 minutes ahead of time then I pick it up to go.  They have a full service bar to satisfy anyone favorite drink.. .  But the ice cold beer is the best!  All these other reviews seem like snottsdale snobs in the wrong neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I herd this long wongs was a good place to eat. We show up, order take-out they said 15 minutes \" ok fine\". After 20 minutes later no one tells me anything. I go to the waitress and tells me it will take another 5 minutes. We wait 15 and still nothing. I decided to ask whats taking so long. They tell me they are really busy and the order will be out \" eta\". I decide to ask for my money back and to speak with a manager. Waitress goes to the back, comes back and says the owner is in the back cooking and will be right out. 10 minutes pass and nothing, so decided to leave with my money. I hear it takes a long time to get your food even for dine-in. I will never visit this long wongs again. i went to long wongs in glendale. Food took 15 minutes. Its way smaller than this one, busy as hell and still managed to get my food on time."}
{"text":"Beware! ? if you place a phone order, they tell you it will be 10 mins, so I placed my order before going in expecting to pick up my wings! And when I get there to my surprise they said I had to wait 30 mins for them to make them! So what is the purpose of phone orders! This business really needs to structure there MANAGMENT if they want to have more business! I will not recommend to anyone! I will stick to going to long wongs on 28st and Osborn there more efficient and they do have your phone orders ready! If this business cared about customer service they would have told me ahead of time! It just makes a bad expierance! I will not be returning!!  I wasted an hour of my time! -0"}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service. I called in advance to place an order for 20 wings. The girl on the phone told me it was going to be a 5-10min wait after I get to the location for my order to be ready. I had no problem with that. When I arrive there I tell the cashier that I'm picking up an order. She then charges me for the order and then I wait... 20mins later, I'm still waiting.... 30min later, I'm still waiting... May I remind you that nobody checked up on me or my order that whole time. After 45 min of waiting I had really had it. I went up to the counter and asked how much longer. The girl looked confused. After 5 more min of waiting I told her that we had been waiting for more than 45 min and she said, \"oh the order just went in.\" At this point I was furious. I had been waiting almost an hour for absolutely nothing. If I hadn't said anything to them, who knows how long they would've kept me waiting. I immediately asked for a refund. Then the \"manager\" came. If you can even call her that. She, for some reason thought it was a good idea to argue with me about how long I've been waiting instead of actually apologizing or trying to find a solution to the problem. I will never go back there. It was a waste of gas and an hour of my time. I strongly suggest that no one else goes there either. If there was a negative rating, I would've picked the lowest."}
{"text":"My wife and I are always trying to find new local & cheap places to eat near home. We were actually headed right next door for Chipotle when we drove past Long Wongs and decided to give it a try. We are not scared away from divey looking food joints as we have had some really great food from similar places...so the look inside and out was not bothersome. Upon entering we were handed menus and told we could sit anywhere we'd like. We chose the bar seating. It was not busy and only a handful of tables had customers seated. The menu prices are pretty cheap and we decided on nachos, a pastrami sandwich w/ Swiss (only cheese options American & Swiss), & and order of boneless wings to share.
Our waitress must have been new because she did not know the menu. When we asked for the boneless wings with garlic Parmesan sauce, she stated we couldn't get that sauce with those wings and it was only available for the regular wings. So we asked if she could do a sub for the Parmesan sauce as they just pour the sauce on top. She didn't know if there were any options for an alternate cheese on the sandwich. After talking to the cook everything was fine and we ordered exactly what we wanted...minus the provolone I wanted on my sandwich.
The drinks, silverware, napkins, & straws are self serve and the soda is dispensed through one of those fancy soda machines in an area in the corner of the restaurant near the bathrooms....yuck. Yet, the waitress brings you glasses with ice but will not fill it for you....even sitting at the bar. They were out of my drink of choice and the soda tasted off.
The nachos came out first.....COLD. Basically the nachos were chips, a small amount of room temp nacho cheese, sliced jalapenos, fresh cold sliced tomatoes, guac (with NO seasonings AT ALL), & a very small amount of COLD ground beef on top. We each took one bit...harrible! 
Needless to say after the one bite we were totally off put and let our waitress know that the nachos were the worst we'd ever had and she could cancel the rest of our order and we took our business next door.
We will never try this place again."}
{"text":"They have old Pac Man arcade machine ..it works at times but it's so.old the knobs  don't always work.properly.  The food is inexpensive and.decent.  Not the best wings but pretty good.  I.wish they offered blue.cheese.with the.wings instead they give.you ranch. .. nice staff"}
{"text":"To go is no good I got home and my  where soggy and so where my wings i was upset I use to love it idk what happend"}
{"text":"Called in for pick up and stated you have to get to the store and pay for it and they will start coking the order......what's the purpose of phone order especially if I'm paying with a card.......I thought that was stupid! Just lost my business.... see ya!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a wing expert, lover, and experimenter.  I like wings, but they are not something I would ever crave or \"have to have,\" so when my boyfriend is in the mood, I get my fix as well.  On a lazy Sunday afternoon, my man wanted him some wings.  After shooting him down on his fav place(Zipps, which are DELISH, I just didn't want a bar atmosphere) he suggested we come here(we now live 3 min away from this location).  We pulled up to a completly empty parking lot and small, very weird looking front.  I was under the impression that this place would be funky and hip, but it is just a small take out or eat in place.  The decor is short of nothing at all.  We ordered 10 medium wings, 10 honey bbq, a long wong(regular hot dog), cheese sticks, and 1 bottle of Heinekin each. 

We went outside to the picnic tables in front and waited for our food to be ready(about 10 min).  The wings were delicious, but I liked the honey bbq way better then the regular.  The hot dog was SO delicious, juicy, and grilled.  Yum yum.  The cheese sticks seemed either frozen or not cooked enough...I would not order again.

It was WAY too much food for us, although we ended up eating the rest of the wings for dinner.  All in all, I enjoyed their wings, but it would not be a place I would come to and sit down again.  If I was having a party or football viewing, I would definitely come get take out, but this is not my idea of a \"fun\" restaurant.  

Also, I like Zipps wings better.  I like big, plump, juicy wings as opposed to smaller, crisper wings.  So there is my review:  Cheap, good for take out, GET A HOT DOG on the side.

Amen"}
{"text":"I would like to say, I had GREAT customer service from Denise. I called in Friday to place a large order and she went ABOVE & BEYOND to assist me. This was my first time ordering from this particular Long Wong's based on the terrible reviews. I decided to give it a shot and I brought the reviews to Denise's attention and I must say, She acknowledge the reviews and wanted to do EVERYTHING in her power to change that. Well guess what Denise you're on your way. I WILL be back :-)"}
{"text":"Best wings in metro phx area. Been coming here for 25+ years and wing sauce is the best. Medium has the most flavor with just a touch of heat. If you like a bit more vinegar in your wing sauce, ask for the Andy special."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the worst places I have ever been too. The food is below average, the service is awful and the place is dirty. The last time I went I couldn't get anyone to help me at the counter to place my order. I finally turned around and walked out the door......forever."}
{"text":"Awful, very disappointed

Wings were bland with little to no sauce. Sauce was not hot or very good.

They charge $1.50 to use a Debit Card

Just don't bother going!"}
{"text":"Walked in, smelled like fish, no acknowledgement from the cashier, I haven't even tried the food yet and already regret coming here


Wings were good , service was horrible"}
{"text":"I love their wings (mild or medium for me), fries, and hot dogs too!  If I'm feeling really adventurous I get the Danny Special (10 wings with cajun fries) and a hot dog and save some of the wings for the next day.  That is one of my only complaints; I wish you could order just a half dozen wings...sometimes you only want a few!

If you don't plan on eating there call your order in so you don't have to sit and wait."}
{"text":"Decided to stop at Long Wong on AZ Ave, Chandler and same location I go to for wings. Like usual I ordered mini bucket (25) Hot wings, which is good do it 2 people. When i got home and opened the box I was surely disappointed because they were the smallest wings I have ever bought. Also it looked like they gave me an order that was sitting because the wings were not only tiny wings, they were soggy, paid more due to a price increase.  I noticed my order was ready fast and it's usually busy on Friday's and the wait is longer for freshly cooked wings. Now I hope I don't get sick... however, I wasted my money and if that's the way their wings are going to be, I'll have to find another wing place because it is not good business to raise prices for itty bitty wings, and not worth give customer's their money's worth. Beware!"}
{"text":"This is for the take out... It's always our go to place at least once when we come into town to visit grandma. Thinking that our palates had changed as we grew older .. Wrong! Either that or we were extremely hungry. Either way, the hot spice which we might guess might be Red's hot sauce smothered all over chicken wings still is delicious. Must have their ranch dressing to dip and fried zucchini to accompany the deliciousness. It's a quick go to meal. We always get one of each \"heat\". Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. All staff has an unwelcoming face. Theres no sign that says \"wait to be seated\" or \"seat yourself\". So you have to figure it out on your own. Your lucky if they see you sit otherwise you will wait 30 min for your drinks. And if they mistake your order because they can't hear over the loud music they will still charge you for it even if you didn't eat it after telling us it was our fault that we thought cactus sticks ment cheese sticks. we even pinpointed out on the menu what we wanted. they probably made the poor waitress pay for the 60 dollars worth of food we cancelled all because the manager. the really need to train their staff on customer service, especially the careless manager."}
{"text":"This place is discussing they have Roaches! horrible customer service they don't make the food until you get there even if you order over the phone.  The bathroom is disgusting. Once they changed owners this place went downhill just filthy. I got food poisoning when I went there so did my daughter I can't believe they are still open! I feel bad for the young man that was helping me he looked so embarrassed to be working there and truly sorry. Unfortunately I can't say the same for the Manager (Victor) try at your own risk the other long Wong locations are clean just not this one people eat there this is wrong."}
{"text":"Hours of operation:
Monday-Thursday: 10am-9pm
Friday & Saturday: 10am-10pm
Sunday: 10am-8pm

I love love love Long Wong's wings! Although 15 minutes usually means 30 minutes, just for a heads up. 
I always ask for extra saucey wings and this location doesn't do the best job at that. But their wings are amazing & super affordable!"}
{"text":"Very poor service !!! Terrible employees, not in work uniform, employee on phone talking with friends not taking orders was very big lines. Then afterwards i was second in line waited 2 hours for my food never even got it. My children are small they had to use restrooms and it had no soap nor toliet paper . So discussing: Not sanitary woupd never go again. Worst place to go needs metter ownership & leaders to make a better customer  service. This place needs a lot of help to improve . Soon this business store will no longer have any customers.."}
{"text":"Petrified Wings
I can only say that the wings are over-fried. I think these may have been fried three or more times. A piece of the wing hit the plate with a petrified clink. 
The carrot and celery sticks are mushy and off color. I had to photograph the condition so you would know the situation at hand."}
{"text":"SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!! They dont refill your drinks, which I always just order water. Dont come to check on you and if you try to wave them down they just roll their eyes as if they were doing me a huge favor to come to our table. Its not just one waitress its all of the young girls that work there. If you plan on trying out the food I would suggest you come prepare for bad service or order out. Good luck with them answering their phone by the way. Last week I tried calling 4 different times to order pick up and no one ever answered. When I got there the cashier said she was very busy but the place was barely half full. 

I absolutely LOVE the wings there especially the honey hot but I think it is about time to start looking for another wing spot because of their bad service. =(

Oh another thing if you are planning on taking children there please be aware that sometimes they play inappropriate shows/music videos on tv and they have karaoke on Fridays and I believe Saturdays nights as well."}
{"text":"Long Wongs on 75th Ave & Thomas got me messed up !!


We order 2 orders  of wings (different flavors) get all the way home to the South Side and notice that they put them all in the same container , separated by one sheet of wax paper !! Who the hell does that shit.....?!?

I call to complain and Yadira (the manager ) says \"Yeah, that how we serve our wings!\" No apology, no explanation whatsoever....i also notice that they only gave us one sauce (for 20 wings) and when I tell her she says\" Well thats because we don't give sauce for dipping your wings ,it's only for your veggies!\"

Also , since when does a dozen wings contain only 10 ?!?

AND to top it off , she expected us to drive all the way back to 75th ave , from the Southside, to \"SHOW HER\" !!

DO NO GIVE THIS SHITTY BUSINESS YOUR MONEY !!"}
{"text":"Had the honey hot wings, it wasn't bad, just mediocre. My search for a mom and pop great hot wings. So far no one has come close to Buffalo Wild Wings, but they're a franchise :( anyone knows of great hot wings, please let me know?"}
{"text":"Honestly if you want GREAT wings , this is the place. Extra crispy bone in ( lemon pepper & medium are my top) and a delicious order of fried zucchini and you'll be set ."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible. I made a phone order for wings. They told me 30 minutes until it was ready.  Get there 30 minutes later and tell them I'm there to get my pick up order. The lady has me wait 10 minutes as she is filling orders, and then she says to me \"sorry we are all out\" next time! Are you freaking kidding me!? What type of business takes orders and has people drive to them. Makes them wait and then says they are out and to come back next time! Absolutely horrible! They don't even deserve 1 star!"}
{"text":"Must Try Wings

Hands down best wings in town, I've had nothing but great service here from the staff and the manager him self. The food is absolutely amazing the wing sauce is one of the best I've tried thus far! Let's talk about ranch, always a touchy subject but this homemade gem is my favorite paired perfectly with both pizza and wings. Highly recommend, you won't be disappointed trust me!"}
{"text":"I just tried this place at the behest of a young lady who was craving hot wings of all things (No, we're not expecting) and low and behold the wings were actually pretty damn good.

If I recall correctly they have Mild, Medium, Hot, and Suicide. She chose the Mild while I chose the Suicide (No, we're not expecting, dammit!), yet here I am Yelping about this place, so obviously they weren't that hot...or \"suicidal\" I mean. But then again I was raised on spicy food, so keep that in mind. At any rate, the taste of the glaze was good...very good.

They also had burgers, hot dogs, and other all-American greats on the menu. The price was cheap and the appearance and cleanliness of this establishment was on point.

I will be going back; I suggest you give this joint a try. No, I don't mean it that way."}
{"text":"I have been trying to figure out for years what was the hype about Long Wong's and what was the big hype about lemon pepper wings. So last night my boyfriend decided to bring the two together. Epic mistake. the lemon pepper wings was so salty and an edible. I thought that lemon pepper wings with a lemon pepper sauce not the lemon pepper seasoning itself just rained on the wings. I tried to eat as many as I could because I didn't want to seem like The Ungrateful girlfriend. needless to say I will not be going back to Long Wong wings and I will never eat lemon pepper wings again in my life."}
{"text":"I placed a DoorDash order at 8:19. At 8:55 it was cancelled. Thanks a lot for the heads up. You had plenty of time to prepare it or at least notify me. Then you refuse to answer the phone but technically you're still open. Very poor customer service, very unhappy customer."}
{"text":"DONT GO HERE!! WAITED FOR OVER AN HOUR!! ITS DIRTY AS HELL AND THE MANAGER/OWNERS SERVICE IS BEYOND TERRIBLE. 

Upon walking in you can see that the place hasn't been kept up with in a really long time. The green paint on the front counter is really dirty and peeled off everywhere so they're in a desperate need of a renovation. Everything is so dusty there is really disgusting. If you do go here just look around at their fixtures, everything is super dirty. 

I called at 3pm to order a cantina platter(appetizer sampler) and 30 wings, ran an errand, went to the bank, then when I finally showed up they hadn't even started my order yet. I had wait exactly 45 minutes after I got there to receive my food. The manager/owner Victor tried to say he didn't start my order because \"he didn't want the food to get soggy\" and that \"it was for my benefit.\" All which was bullshit because you can see through the window in the kitchen that they just take the food from the fridge and fry it, none of which takes 45 minutes!! It's fried food!! Lol. Other than the manager giving me that BS, the host at the front didn't seem to know what was going on at all and kept saying \"5 more minutes.\" No one should have to wait an hour for fried food, plain and simple. There were two more people that were waiting there just as long as I had been. They had more than enough staff to accommodate for their orders cause the restaurant wasn't too busy or packed for being a Saturday afternoon. You're better off going somewhere, ANYWHERE else than coming here. The owner doesn't know what the hell he is doing nor cares for his establishment. Just about every review I've read from this place (on yelp and google) is similar to mine so read up and don't ever go here! I don't wish service this terrible on anyone."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town so I don't know the owner or manager or anybody else. I read some of the reviews and was a little concerned until I noticed a pattern. I got the impression they were bogus so decided to give the place a try. 
My four star review is based on other places in the similar price range. For the money the wings are decent. They have a good amount of meat on them and are tasty. I also tried a cheese burger. It was okay, nothing special. I see they have a Tuesday special for wings. That would be a great deal of they serve the same wings.
They have a steady flow of customers and groom the interaction I would say they are regulars. 
It was a very hot day and inside was nice and cool. The customer service was above average. If you want a decent wing at a fair price you should give this place a try. I will be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I always get Danny's Special. A portion of their delicious wings and a side of spicy french fries. These people are smart, they cut a hole out of the styrofoam box to prevent condensation buildup from the steam, maintaining the crispiness of the fries. It's usually just too much food for me and serves as a delicious snack the next day. Best for take-out over dine-in and a great place to pick up party snacks."}
{"text":"Will never go back. Shorted me on wings then wanted to argue about it. They just lost a customer. Hope it was worth it. 

Each time I have gone, it felt like they have nickel and dimed me. 

Last straw!"}
{"text":"I love this LongWongs! They literally make the best wings in the state and I've been EVERYWHERE! Their Golden Hot sauce is FIRE!!!!! They make great hot dogs as well...pro tip get the sauerkraut! They are always fast and polite! Definitely will continue to be a loyal customer. The bad reviews are RIDICULOUS HATERS and we all know...HATERS GONNA HATE! Keep doing your thing LongWongs!"}
{"text":"Recently moved out to AZ from CA and although we like Wingstop and it's our go to place for wings , Long Wongs is hands down excellent . Lemon pepper is on point and I love their saucy garlic Parmesan! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is filthy, it was 110 degrees outside and a little cooler inside. On their menu it has a Wongs steak sandwich that says its steak and onions, I asked if it has peppers as well and she says no, my order was takeout so when I got home to find out my sandwich was smothered with mushrooms which I'm allergic too. 
She never mentioned it would have it on there nor does their menu mention it. Total fail and their wings were bland with no flavor- stay away from this joint."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The wings are so small they must be from chicks not chickens. Don't waste your time with this place. Again the service was so bad we should of just left but we'd already paid."}
{"text":"Great wings and way better than the Phoenix location try the wings and teriyaki chicken bowl. Nice owners!"}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible! The ladies have major attitude! The wings were too over done , there was more crisp than chicken on the bone. Pizza was okay could be better ! When I asked for a to go cup I was being charged $3.45 just for a cup, that's insane, the fact that i asked for water and was charged a actual drink and I  couldn't even take it with me .... I 100 times prefer Longwongs On 26st And Thomas"}
{"text":"If i could put NO STARS, I WOULD.....I called to place order and got \" accidentally hung up on twice....NOT ONCE BUT TWICE\" What a coincidence lol...so i called again and they took so long to answer phone that i got to restaurant before they picked up..ha ha lmao!!! Ok....to make story short...they said 20 minutes for 1 pizza and 20 wings but they actually took almost an hr...the girl ( nancy) the cashier was like in la la land twirling her hair and POOR POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! If you ever ever order make sure you order an hr ahead ha ha ...this place is a joke...bad service and BAD BAD MANAGEMENT, they don't know how to take care of their customers....the only reason their still in business is because  their wings are good but everything else sucks, the girls don't know anything about customer service, they don't know how to take phone orders and put customers on hold, I've worked w/customers all my life and the way they run their business is not good, customers aren't a priority and they have no consideration at all. They really don't care if you go home unhappy that's a huge mistake because of that I'll never ever come back. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ...BELIEVE ME...they took so so long we got a beer and i told her I'm not paying for the beer becauseyou took double the time and manager or superviser still wouldn' give me any kind of discount or throw in the beer for free!!!........WOW, HOW DO THEY STAY IN BUSINESS!!!"}
{"text":"We always call for take out, here. The first couple times was great and food em was tasty. We ordered almost everything on the menu already. The last couple take out orders, they said they didn't have half the menu so we decided to go else where. U fortunately I haven't been back since they seemed to run out of food a couple times."}
{"text":"There are better places, with better service, better pizza...
The place is convenient but it sucks just like Trump!!
My dad used to say, \"create fame and go to sleep\". This is one of those places.

I really wish, hope, this place closes soon, if they love their moms, because they don't deserve the reputation.
Third time here, third time bad experience. That's it!!

If you're reading this, make yourself a favor and go somewhere else!!

{"text":"As life has literally taken me in a different direction, I completely forgot about Long Wongs.  Forgotten until mentioned by my son. I called, ordered the Hot Bucket, and he made the \"run.\"  Our wings were fresh and piping hot!  My son said they've remodeled - good for them!  The old place was dark and dingy - used to give me the \"creeps.\"  Still cash only."}
{"text":"We ordered one dozen wings (all drums, six medium and six garlic parmesan), dinner salad, dragon burger, and curly fries. The fries came out very hot and crisp. The burger was nothing special, but felt fresh and for the price was adequate. The wings were on the small side but were cooked appropriately, had an adequate amount of sauce, and were a great deal for the price. The salad was crisp and fresh, with a nice amount of cucumbers, red cabbage, shredded carrots, and cherry tomatoes. Overall the food was well worth the price and both staff we interacted with were very friendly and helpful. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"ZERO stars! Long wongs are independently owned, but if it was my name I would most definetly pull it from this place. I ordered via phone, and as soon as I walked in I wish I hadn't. This place is dirty, it smells like incense and it overall gives me the creeps. I paid for my order and ate one wing at home. It had almost no meat on it, it was though, and the sauce was nasty. Overall stay away!"}
{"text":"No fancy decor here and limited seating area. The counter is manned by one person using one register and writing your order out on a pad, so it's kinda slow. However, if it's good deep fried wings that you want, this is it. Pretty good selection of burgers and other fare as well."}
{"text":"Great food, but I don't approve how they charge you $3 for celery. How ridiculous every wing place I go to they give it for free or a low charge. I suggest the other long wongs. About a few months ago this one never charged you for it but now they started to do it and it sucks"}
{"text":"I've heard their wings are awesome, but I made my way into Long Wongs craving a burger and fries. While the menu said \"Cajun Fries\" I only received regular fries sprinkled with seasoned salt. Now, it just so happens that I love seasoned salt so it wasn't a big deal, but if you're on the hunt for REAL cajun fries go somewhere else. Their burger was straight forward with cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. I added mustard and ketchup when I got home. It did hit the spot, but wasn't anything too special. Their fried zucchini was just so so. I'd probably never order it again because Carl's Jr has THE BEST fried zucchini out there. Long Wongs is good if you're looking for basic burger shack food. It's affordable and fast."}
{"text":"Love this place. Super cheap and always quick on take out orders. Great for Sunday football"}
{"text":"I am forced to give this dining experience one star since no stars or negative rating is not an option. Besides the poorly attentive, or lack there of, wait staff, the food was deplorable from cold potato skins to horrible & incorrect sandwiches. It took forever to even get the bill or table cleared. This restaurant would be better served as a parking lot for the better surrounding establishments"}
{"text":"I wish the wings were a little cheaper and they would have 5 stars. I got the hot and man I can handle my heat but I think since there was so much sauce I just had to take some off with a napkin. I did like the taste so next time I may go medium or light sauce. I wont go back anytime soon though, for 12 hotwings I can go to Fat Willys and pay less for same if not better taste."}
{"text":"Decided to try out on my lunch break regret it would of rather travelled to native for some good wings. They were to dry no flavor. Never going here again, staff seemed they didn't care even tho I know lunch can get busy should still hold a service expectation."}
{"text":"Love this place! Home made ranch is the best. I like to ask for wings and fries crispy. Have been coming here for decades! Born & raised in the area. Never been a fan of the burgers or pizza, but the wings, fries, fried mushrooms an fried zucchini are great! Salad is good too."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service ever if you're white you don't want to go into this restaurant they will treat you bad"}
{"text":"The wings are tasty, I will say that and that alone, however, with that being said this restaurant needs some serious work on their customer service. Ordered over the phone to pickup and was told 20-30 mins and it would be ready. After getting there in 20 mins to pickup I was told I needed to wait in line with all of the other \"to-go\" orders. Nearly 30 mins later I went up to the front and waited while they filled up the sodas in my order and I paid. During the soda filling process, the machine needed a refill because it went out so I had to wait another 10 minutes while that was completed. After going through my order I realized that I was missing a dozen wings, a salad, and two orders of fries. The guy at the front talked to me like it was a hassle to have to get me the rest of my order. Another 10 plus minutes later...Are you kidding? I would have left and walked out if I wouldn't have paid already and had my husband with the baby in the car screaming because dinner was delayed much later than it ever should have been. I have been visiting this place since I was in high school and have watched this location take a nose dive. I hate to say it but I will not ever be visiting them again. A true end of an era. Sorry Long Wongs but you need to make some serious changes, starting with your customer service and efficiency."}
{"text":"There claim to fame is wings but do be honest I wast impressive with them. We also got a pizza which was decent. The only reason I would give it three stars is the staffs was good and it's fast"}
{"text":"Ive been here like 5 times now and the only thing I get is the Danny's special. That's the only reason I give it a 5 star lol 
Can't speak for anything else!
Anyway, the wings are AMAZING. I hate when wings are soggy on the outside,  but these are perrrfect, crispy on the outside but still smothered in sauce. I get the mild and my boyfriend usually gets the teriyaki and they are both delish. AND it comes with fries!  10 wings & seasoned fried for like 8 bucks, always hits the spot and fills me up"}
{"text":"The worst place I've ever eaten !!  Windows haven't been cleaned In years you can see scum on them. Every chairs  ripped and  rest have tape on them . Waitresses are slow  . The sodas watered down   the food  is less then average  our waitress was right behind the counter picking her teeth  within 6 ft of the serving area  .. The restrooms look like gang city broken mirrors    tagged up ceilings . Just a mess avoid at all costs !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I feel so welcomed that I end up staying way longer than I had planned. I've been coming to this Mom and Pop shop for a while and appreciate greasy wings and piping hot pie as much as the next salivating patron, but what keeps me coming back is the service with a smile!!"}
{"text":"This f**ken place is a got dam joke. 
DO NOT BUY FOOD FROM HERE. 
DO NOT ORDER FOOD FROM HERE 
!!!!DO NOT CALL IN OVER THE PHONE ORDERS TO THIS PLACE. they will not start your order until you get there witch makes absolutely no sense! I called in my order at 6:14pm, I get there, pay for my food, and I get nothing. So I ask. Is my order ready? Then i'm told they don't start making it until I get there and pay. SO WHATS THE POINT OF CALLING IN?"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the service is horrible, and VERY VERY VERY VERY SLOW!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We came late evening and needless to say it was pretty busy. It did take us a while to get noticed and seated but after that the service wasn't that bad. We got our food and everything we needed in good timing . Wings were delicious and pizza was alright."}
{"text":"Little dive place.  Everything greasy and unhealthy you can imagine.  All kinds of tasty."}
{"text":"My coworker took me here last week and I was excited when we pulled into the parking lot. It was a bit early for lunch we were the only ones in the place. We sat down and happened to pick the table that was out of napkins doh! They had a special on the window that was pizza and wings combo for $6 I should have tried that. We decided to split meals I ordered the Tijuana Chicken sandwich and my company the Turkey Double Decker sandwich that he swears by. 

Telemundo was playing on 2 of the 3 or 4 flat screens there was a novela on that was showing an older woman seducing a teenager a la Desperate Housewives that made me a little uncomfortable at 11am. The server seemed a tad new as we had to ask for a few things like ketchup for our fries and drinks went dry till we ordered a nice cold pitcher of beer.  

The Turkey Double came out looking absolutely exquisite!! Truly picturesque seriously the layers were so perfect and it was a great sandwich cut into quarters held together by toothpicks ugh I wanted to take a picture but I was afraid my company would think I'm a nut. My chicken was grilled in a yummy chipotle sauce and topped with canned jalapenos which their juices made the bread soggy pretty quick. I really liked the bread here!! 

Anyway, we were here for a few hours kicking back I conveniently had my dvd player with me and we plugged in and watched some raunchy Bill Hicks all while finishing a pitcher and having some good convos. I'd love to come back and try the pizza and wings next!"}
{"text":"I wish \"zero\" Stars was an option

It has been a long time since eating at an original Long Wongs , so I stopped in to try this location.  Except for the name, this is nothing like the Long Wongs I remember.  Very small, hole in the wall type of place, it feels almost like they should have closed down some time ago.  The place was rather grungy, everything seemed to be in a state of repair, or just plain old.  I almost walked out, but thought what the heck, I am here.  I should have went with my first impression and left this place, one of the worst dining experiences ever . 

We were seated immediately and our server brought us menus to view and stated she be back in a few minutes to take our drink orders. 13 minutes pass our server was nowhere to be found so Ithe manager came to our table and took our orders. 

We ordered one dozen  boneless wings, hamburger,  french fries, and 2 soft drinks. As we were waiting for our food, we served ourselves our own drinks only to realize that one cup had a large crack and the drink spilled all over the table. We waited for a server to come back to the table however she never came back. Eventually, we got someone's attention and they said they would give us a new cup. Another 15 minutes goes by we finally get a cup.  

At this point we're still waiting for our entrees to arrive, while other people who arrived later than us we're already being served. I asked a server, \"how much longer it would be?\" and he stated he would go check, only to never come back and advise us of anything. 

After waiting 47 minutes I decided to leave. I went up to the cashier told her I no longer wanted my order and I would like to pay for my drink.  The cashier asked me if I wanted my food boxed up, I told her I didn't want any food. 

Initially, she was going to charge me for two drinks until I reminded her that the one the cup had a hole and we weren't able to drink from it.

All in all a horrible experience I would never go back again."}
{"text":"Good but every time I come here at the time my food is supposed to be ready it's an extra \"5 minutes\" that's really 10...this has happened every single time I've had take out..."}
{"text":"They have the most idiotic employees I have ever dealt with in my life. Customer service has ALWAYS been awful and tonight I called THREE times with no answer. The fourth time I finally got someone to answer but they didn't talk.... Geniuses"}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH IN AZ! Grilled to perfection, never over cooked like KFC never uncooked like some wannabe chef's I know and bar be cued with! but grilled to perfection! Served with french fries and topped with fresh onions, tomatoes, lettuce and pickles. I absolutely love every mouth watering bite! The staff are excellent as well, I have been going there for over ten years and I still recognize most of the faces there. The staff will go out there way to make your sandwich to the way you desire it most. I was once surprised when I received my sandwich and it had melted cheddar cheese and mushrooms on the top, due to the fact that the order taker took to notice that I often fancy my salad with mushrooms and cheese. Yes it was delicious! I love this place! You can purchase this particular meal for under 5.50 you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Many years ago Long Wongs meant you were getting the best wings in AZ. Well, unfortunately, tonight was so far from the best of anything. This place has an odor that is unidentifiable. We (me, my wife and two kids) place our order for what I thought was a pretty easy to handle order. A dozen medium boneless, a dozen garlic parmesan boneless, half dozen with fries, and a dozen split teriyaki  and garlic parmesan. Pretty simple for a wing joint, right? Wrong!! It took almost 45 minutes to get the worst wings in AZ. The garlic parmesan wings, both the boneless and the traditional were load with medium wing sauce then covered in nasty parmesan cheese. My wife and my daughter don't do spicy and could not eat their wings. We approach the guy that is bouncing around the dining room and request a refund. He tells us that he does not have the authority to refund, and that there is no manager on the premises. He gives us a blank ticket with the managers name on it and tells us to call back tomorrow. Mind you, this is after he told me that the manager just showed up to help, because one of the employees went home sick. This place was a HUGE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! Almost $40 spent and still had to go somewhere else to eat. If I could give this joint zero stars, you bet your ass I would."}
{"text":"This is my brother's go to place for wings. I like their wings but they can do better. I feel they add too much butter in their sauces. I know wings isn't really healthy anyway but maybe lessen the butter content. Their service is pretty quick and you are out the door. Cheap wings for decent quality."}
{"text":"When I asked for 2 drops of hot sauce on top of my ketchup and she told it was .50cents for the 2 droplets.....She lost my business for life."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, server was on her cell phone most of the time. We were told prior to ordering wings that they would take 25 minutes, ordered 10 wings and waited when the wigs came out they were left unattended as you can definitely see they were chicken wing crisps.... Not the good kind, the wings were so over cooked that they couldn't be pulled apart as you do with wings. Burger was so plain and unappetizing he curly fries were also burnt. Overall this place was a real misfortune to go too, as we sat and observed all customers had an unpleasant look on their face with either the food or the server. 
Mind you, their ranch was good...."}
{"text":"I've seen the poor reviews,  but my experience was good.  It's a old place,  but good, meaty wings.  I went on Tuesday, when boneless wings were $0.50 each, and they were good sized, nice chicken meat, a little greasy but good.i would good again,  but if probably good to ATL wings up the road, it's newer feeling with greasy people."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Service there sucks. Took a very long time before we were even acknowledged. We finally were helped. Ordered nachos. The menu didn't say anything about meat being on the nachos. When we finally got them, they're was meat all over the top. I said we didn't order meat I them. She said it comes that way. I pointed them out on the menu and she even read it out loud. No mention of meat. She then got an attitude about it and said they come that way. I refused the meal. I didn't want them made again. At that point I didn't trust what would come out. We then had to pay for our sodas.....which should have been free after they messed up.  Never going back and will tell all my coworkers not to go there since we are across the street."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places to go if you want wings. For 50 wings you only get two sauces. What a ripoff. I have never been to a wing place that only lets you choose two sauces for 50 wings.  This is definitely not a place to get wings.  Definitely not world famous.  I would tell you please do your self a favor and go to BWW.  I hope there pizza is going to be better but I guess will see."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Long Wongs so when I saw there was one on on Az ave I was excited to try it.  I should have know when I killed a cockroach in the dining room I should have left.  The worst stop for lunch in many many weeks.  The wings are mediocre at best!  I ordered 12 wings half garlic Parmesan and 1/2 Medium with a basket of fried mushrooms.  The sauce didn't look like it was completely mixed it was lumpy and water.  The  Garlic Parmesan looked like they dipped the wings in hot sauce and dumped some extra seasoning on them.  The mushrooms were the best part of the meal Very large except they were way over cooked to the point the batter looked black in places.  Needless to say I won't be returning anytime soon and"}
{"text":"This place was eh.  The wings are good and very saucy then again we went kinda late so maybe they were trying to get rid of the extra buffalo wing sauce.  Pizza was eh too.  I prefer Peter Piper if that tells you anything.  This place was our 2nd joice being that Granpas was about  to close. Long Wongs is not what is used to be:("}
{"text":"If I could pick anything lower than 1 star I definitely would have. Worst service ever. We sat for 15 mins while people who sat after us had their orders taken. The waitress looked directly at me several times while I tried to get her attn but still never came around. I guess if you're white, tattooed, or gay you shouldn't even bother at this place. I love the wings but they aren't worth the beyond terrible service. And to make it worse as we were leaving bc no one would take our order the waitress smiled like she was happy to see us leaving."}
{"text":"I can't even review on the food. I wouldn't recommend going to this location. I called ahead and ordered a whole bunch of wings for our football party and the lady on the phone said it would be ready in half an hour. I get there to pick it up and she comes out and says, \"no more chicken left\" and than switches her sign to closed!!! Who takes phone orders and than has the nerve to tell a customer come back another time after I haven't received the order I was promised. She had no remorse and that location will never get my business again."}
{"text":"Victor M. (Owner) tries too hard to improve his failing business in all the wrong ways, especially by commenting and rating his business 5/5 stars when surely it deserves nothing more than an eviction notice and a notice from the health department. Will surely be disqualified. Goodbye, you are the weakest link. 

A for effort though.

F for creativity."}
{"text":"I came on a weekday craving some wings. 
I left with probably elevated cholesterol and higher blood pressure. 

The problem is that the wings are definitely miniaturized. For the price that I paid, I guess that's to be expected. However, it threw off the balance of the wings as they were much too salty for my taste. Think licking mini cubes of salt...

I ordered the Danny's Special, so there were both wings and fries. 
I did really dig the cajun spice on the fries, but not enough to warrant another visit

P.S. $10 min on credit/debit card"}
{"text":"Idk why this place has so many negative reviews as the wings are tasty and crispy. Good amount of sauce, crispiness, and of course price cannot be beat. I would recommend to order on the phone for pickup as often times they may be busy. This is probably my go to spot for great wings."}
{"text":"I try to call to make an order and they ask my if I can hold, so I wait and see but I was on hold for ten minutes. So I kept the line on hold while I called from a different line and they still kept me on hold. I don't know if they're busy or they just don't wanna answer the phone but that is very rude customer service and etiquette. How are u supposed to keep customers if you don't wanna sell anything?!"}
{"text":"Some of the best wings anywhere and the best buffalo wings in Arizona! 
I think that they fry their wings because they are crispy and oh-so-delicious. BBQ and hot are my favorite. The fries go well with the wings too.

Sad thing is that they water down their ranch sauce so it doesn't stick to your wings. Order take out and get your own ranch and you should be good to go."}
{"text":"Zero stars,  if I  could give it. This place SUCKS. The waitress shows up to take your order, drop off your food and give you a check. Doesn't stop by to see if you need anything. Place is filthy. Food is terrible. Service horrible.  Will never  return to a Long Wongs restaurant."}
{"text":"Can I just say, holy crap, I am so disappointed.  I was looking for a place close to the house with wings less expensive than other wing joints. I tried Long Wongs on a chance that I could find something convenient. The wait time was short, but the wings were blah. I got a dozen 1/2 garlic parm 1/2 hot and a side of \"suicide\". The garlic parm was mild sauce with Parmesan cheese melted on it and the hot tastes just like franks, but less spicy. The \"suicide sauce\" was so weak that I was mad I paid extra for it. Oh and why don't they salt the fries? Bummer."}
{"text":"This place has changed ownership MANY times, been going thee for years until today.  Last two meals were bad, cold, soggy.  wings are small and sauces are not as hot as other places (suicide is franks red hot with cayenne in it...whoopeeee!).
today I had to get a refund on the Hot Dog after 22 minutes, they said \"the cheese takes extra time\"  made me late for work.  the pita was cold and soggy and when I got home wife threw it in trash.  Too Bad, thsi used to be a great place for cheap, good food...maybe the next owner will mop the floor and improve food"}
{"text":"Very bland wings.  Ordered 24 hot wings.  Forced to pay 1.50 to use a debit card.  

Wings were done in 5 mins.  I should have figured that they would be horrible 

No sauce on the wings and they tasted like they were fried in dirty old oil


Skip this long wongs and hit up the one on central and baseline 

Zero stars if possible"}
{"text":"I don't get what why this place has won Best of Phoenix in Phx Magazine. I went to this place for some wings and was not impressed with the run down interior (blinds breaking as I was ordering) and lack of cleanliness. I would have still looked over that stuff is that food was good, but it was meh. Not worth it, not sure what this place has other than a funny name."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever experienced. Waitresses walked right by our table multiple times and didn't take our order. Didn't even acknowledge us. Don't go here if you want any kind of service. Horrible, horrible service they don't deserve any stars."}
{"text":"Better wings!

Been visiting this place for like 2-3 weeks now and the delicious flavored wings is same as the first time that I had it in my mouth

The wings are getting better and better each day.

I just recommended this one to my friends.

Long Live Long Wongs!"}
{"text":"My family and i went in for lunch during a week day and it was not busy at all, only one other customer there. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. first off it took an excessive amount of time to make 2 buffalo chicken sandwiches and one lunch special (6 Wings & fries). Finally my sandwich came out not being what i expected at all. it was supposed to be a chicken breast (grilled I assume) and what i received was 3 small pieces of dried out chicken on 2 pieces of sliced bread (not even a bun). It could not be eaten as a sandwich because the bread was soaked in excessive amounts of wing sauce. if i wanted a chicken sandwich with wing sauce thrown everywhere i would have made a much better one at home. No refills were offered on the drinks, we didn't even receive the bill, I had to go to the counter and pay my bill without receiving one at the table. I requested ranch for my sandwich and was not informed i would be paying $1.50 for 1 ounce of ranch. Needless to say we will not be returning to this establishment and highly recommend not wasting your time dinning here."}
{"text":"Came in to the restaurant close to closing time and the staff was really helpful. Got my wings in 10 minutes and with extra sauce!!! Couldn't have asked for a better place to get my wings!#freequentflyer"}
{"text":"Good wings.....!!shit hole environment!!. Music was waaaaaaaaaaaay to loud...and I listen to loud metal music on a daily basis..so that tells you something? I would rather go to an old, dusty possibly abandoned old biker bar shack before heading to this place...take everything to go and eat ur wings at your house...or the car. Look lol"}
{"text":"Perfect for you greasy hangover food.  Danny's special (wings and Cajun fries) is great.  Don't get the fried mushrooms, they don't have any taste to it.  Due to me only eating here when two sheets to the wind or hungover AF the review results in three stars.  Oh and definitely call ahead and do take out, don't eat in."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 10 stars. I also wish I didn't live 3,000 miles from here. My family and I used to life around the corner and would go every couple of weeks because the food was awesome ( still the best wings I've ever had hands down) as if the food wasn't a good enough reason, the people there were awesome too! One time we didn't go for about a month because we were out of town and when we returned the lady asked us where we had been and how our daughter was. Unfortunately we had to move due to the Army and being stationed at Fort Bragg. If I ever come within 500 miles of this place I'll go out of my way to stop in! Love it!"}
{"text":"Very below average wing spot.
Their wing sauces are very plain and feels like they bought it from a grocery store. I don't recommend to go here for wings."}
{"text":"The wings are really good. They have self sitting along with self service drinks with CocaCola Freestyle machine. 

But the place looks like no one wants to clean unless asked to, or perhaps begged to. The staff isn't that welcoming when you first come in either."}
{"text":"Bad!.... Used to be the best wings for me even though the pizza was really bad and for a while the pizza started doing better!  Now pizza is beyond awful and wings are down there with its level.  Yes it is loud and prices are ridiculous, was able to stand all of these due to the wings being so good, not anymore.  If there was an option for negative stars I would use it for this place!"}
{"text":"I feel like a solid three stars is perfect for a rating. My reasoning the waitress was super nice & managed to remember our entire order in her head without writing it down. But the food was ehh (insert straight face emoji here). I was really craving wings and should have went elsewhere. My son ate the entire grilled cheese which was worth the 3.75 because it came with French fries. But the fries were so boring, no seasoning or anything. They just give you these microscopic salt packets for the fries. Which didn't help AT ALL. I got a burger and that was just as basic as the fries, now I have heard a lot about their burgers and was expecting something way better. It's like they have don't have ANY seasoning in the kitchen everything is super bland. Blah!!!!!!!! The burger was bland, fries bland, wings were a-okay. Hence the 3-stars."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Called and hung up on after being placed on hold 4 times by Brianna. Waited an hour for what I was told would be 15-20 minutes. Complained to the manager Dulce and she said there was nothing she would do. No discount for cold food. Told to Accept it as is and told me to call the owner tomorrow if I was unhappy. I left the $50 cold order and left the store! Will absolutely not go here again! Buyers beware!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry guys, I just wasn't impressed with Long Wongs.

Dude and I were feeling like wings one evening after bowling, so we decided to stop in here and get some to go and see what the big whoop was. 

We tried the Hot and Suicide flavors. 

The wing sauces were way too salty, vinegary, and the wings were pretty bare meat wise.  

Meh, I've experienced better indeed sums it up."}
{"text":"Was just there last night and I gotta agree with everyone Worst service!!! Our server didn't come to check on us at all we had to go to her. I'll never b going back. Management needs to do something quick"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but the menu has changed drastically from what was already posted. Much higher prices, less selection, no more pizza or kids' meals. But dogs, chicken strips, and burgers were good."}
{"text":"I got chicken tenders from Long Wong's I thought they were going to be terrible. I had low expectations but I was pleasantly surprised! They were really juicy. The wings were really tasty and I like you can pick the exact amount you want since they charge per wing."}
{"text":"I used to live fairly close to this long wongs and frequently ordered food from there. I would always take the food to go as the inside of the restaurant left alot to be desired. My biggest concern was if the cleanliest of the seating area of the place, extended into the kitchen as well. The food was always good and was always what I expected but I never wanted to stay for long as the inside of the restaurant was always dirty.

I would give the food a 4 and the restaurant a 1 if I could separate the rating system."}
{"text":"Never come in here to order your food TO-GO. We waited for 1 hour exactly for our food to come out. It was shitty service and no particular order. You're better off either calling in order (and that's if they answer the phone) and coming in 30-45 min later after placing it. Or coming during a non-busy hour. Either way. ATL wings are better and just as popular and took way less of waiting time."}
{"text":"This place is AWFUL! Not the food but the service. You try to place a pickup order and they wont make the food until you get there. What the hell is the point of placing a pick up order?!?! Second, the ladies at the register and who answer the phone are (insert f bomb) R U D E!!!!!!! I could of slapped one of them through the phone and this has happened on more than one occasion. I called them back to tell them I was going to a different location and the bitch hung up on me! NO more service from me. I'll stick to the one on 43rd and Indian School"}
{"text":"This place.
The parking lot was full so I already knew this was going to be good.
Ordered wings....lots of wings btw and pizza.
My fav foods are both wings and pizza...so I have tried a ton of these from various places and states and here in Phx since we moved here.
I was excited to try Long Wongs so eclectic and quirky looking and the name is interesting, but anyway.

Wings arrived in good timing and pizza, no issue there.
Wings were cooked crispy (not bad) I like mine this way, but the sauces yall.(I find wings really hard to mess up when cooking, but we all know the sauce is everything.)
The sauces we tried lemon pepper and ranch or gold (i can't even remember). We decided to try something different because their sauce options are slim. 

We got them home and we were starving, started to eat and....WTF hit us both at the same time. Somewhere in the magical wing world, a few baby wings cried real salty tears at what just occurred. It was a painful eat.
Painful AF to be starving and eating wings that just ain't good plain and simple. The sauces were just bland very bland. One was a dry rub which was lemon pepper and one side wasn't even seasoned and it was very light lemon pepper. The other one was a wet sauce that wasn't very flavorful at all. It was 


We literally stopped, sat there, and walked away. Came back remembering we had a pizza \"clutch\".....THAT PIZZA would save us.

I have never....
I have never in my...
I have never in my life had a pizza so nasty.
The sauce...I guess we were the pizza where they decided to save on the sauce, there wasn't much, they shorted us on the cheese, and it barely covered the pizza. I believe pizza and wings to be basic items that are hard to get wrong and they killed it, literally murdered my tasted buds. I had nightmares that night.

I still get the flash of the full parking lot.... I now dream and wonder what was everyone eating there and surely it wasn't the pizza or wings.

So my first warning is to people that are straight from the south & east coast...envision The worse wings and pizza you've had...those are probably better than these, so skip.

For anyone else:
If your only criteria for eating out is survival & price than please visit them for cheap wings and pizza that are edible, but not actually tasty.

I wanted to like this place but...this first encounter was just too much for my heart to bear.
Maybe the other food is better idk, I will never return. 
I said what I said. #sorrynotsorry #truthteller"}
{"text":"Well tonight is the last time I will be spending my money at this location. As the price increases, the size of the wings decreases. There's no reason why the carrots that they put in your to go container are digger than your wings. I haven't been satisfied with them since my 1st review. And the fries that came with it were not even fresh or at least warm. I don't understand how a busy establishment has cold fries. I should've went to ATL Wings up the street and that's where I'll be going for now on"}
{"text":"Best wings ever!! Love to order the family pack which is very affordable.
NOT the most attractive place. it could definitely use a remodel or something . The only annoying thing is they dont accept credit/debit cards.

GREAT food . They just need to keep up on the times."}
{"text":"Long Wong's 75Th ave and Thomas The worse restaurant I have ever been to. The staff was very slow for starters ..... Then when they turned on the juke box it was so loud you could not even talked to your family. Now I would expect this in a bar but not a restaurant. When I asked the Manager if they could lower the volume I was told no but I was welcome to leave. Now I am not racist but thus staff was playing Hispanic music so load you could not hear the person next to you. The Hispanic staff refused to lower the volume and they were very rude. 

I don't care what you do or what your race is I try to treat every body the same.  My issue was never about the type of music though we do live in America. The issue always was the volume until the management made it a race issue.  

I would strongly recommend any white people not enter this establishment ...."}
{"text":"This place is awesome as everyone says. Great wings and Pepsi in a bottle (coke too but I'm a Pepsi guy). 

The same lady is there every day at lunch and will recognize you if you come in a few times. She's very nice and good humored. 

I haven't tried much on the menu because their wings are so good that I can't bring myself to order anything else."}
{"text":"Went in to pickup order called in and when l arrived food not ready and she was taking orders and they were getting food before me 3 customers, must hv been her friends.Food looked really good and the large portions,took a bite of the fried not fresh mushrooms and they were half froxen.Fries were good,cheeseburger was good,hot wings were gross they tasted like hot vinegar wings,terrible.Last time coming to this dump."}
{"text":"Was not immediately impressed when I walked in. Place is in desperate need of some renovation. Drink was served in a cheap plastic cup. Food was served on plastic dishes. Waitress was unfriendly and made a face when I wanted my sauce on the side. So I ordered a salad instead. My partner ordered the special, boneless wings and a 7\" pizza. Salad was huge and ok. Did have lots of chicken but chicken was bland and breading was awful. Also way too much cheese. My partner said the pizza was bland and the chicken \"wings\" looked like popcorn chicken from sonic  (which didn't taste near as good as sonic). I also found it unsettling finding hair that I know isn't mine (cuz I have no hair!) In my salad. Gross. Never eating here again"}
{"text":"We ordered 30 wings and a large 2 topping pizza with a 2 liter. My husband got home and when we looked at the order we realized that they didnt give us the right pizza. I called to let them know and the manager on the phone tried to convince me that they gave us what we ordered. Not to mention they didnt even provide the soda they upsold us on or THE RECEIPT! We did not spend almost $50 there to not get what we ordered! We will NEVER order from this establishment again."}
{"text":"Not great. Burger was tasteless and I threw it away. French fries were so bland and also tasted stale"}
{"text":"Tried again, and disappointed again! Called ahead and not ready because they take care of walk ins first. Got home and the only item hot were the fried zucchini. We were missing the curly fries.  Chilli dog was terrible! The mozzarella sticks were very cold! The only thing we can say is the fried zucchini is very good and so were the wings but everything was cold and we had to reheat."}
{"text":"This place is good reminds me how my dad makes them.. If you don't want to pay the 0.35 charge bring cash.. Heard the suicide wings is less spicer than the hot.."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER! I let them know that they had overcharged me on one of my pizzas, instead of acknowledging the mistake and refunding me back the money they overcharged, the manager \"Victor\" proceeded to argue with me, he finally said \"I'll just give you a dollar back to get you out of here\" to get me out of here? I am a professional adult who pays taxes and votes, I'm not a homeless person who is trying to scam A business out of something, to get me out of here? I have never been treated this awfully. I was almost embarrassed for the manager, at how foolish he was acting. I felt bad for the owners of this Arizona staple. The \"World Famous\" Long Wong's pizza and wings should know what a terrible manager they have working for them. If I were you \"victor\" I might stop wearing polos with my name on them, or at least be embarrassed at the way you treated a long time patron today."}
{"text":"Took my family here 2 nights ago for wings and pizza and the service is horrible.  No courtesy words, have to beg to get the table wiped off.  Zero stars in my book!"}
{"text":"Great wangs.  Horrible servace.  I suffer through the horrible service for the awesome, cheap wings."}
{"text":"This place is dangerously close to my condo!  Amazing wings!  They offer fast take out and great prices.  An order of Honey BBQ wings and onion wings are my cravings.  If you ever need a quick wing fix, stop in."}
{"text":"Very affordable and the wings are delicious. Love the buffalo and BBQ flavors. The wings are always fresh and cooked well. Staff could be quicker in getting the food out."}
{"text":"I've been a fan since moving to the valley almost 30 years ago. I frequent the location in So Sco. The wings have always been good. But the last few times, I have noticed they are much smaller than they used to be which is disappointing, considering the price.
Having said that they are still better than BWW anyday."}
{"text":"We always get take out here. Wings are always fresh and good. Medium sauce and lemon pepper are my favorites. Call ahead for family specials they have going!"}
{"text":"I had wanted to try Long Wong's for quite some time. Tonight was the night! We pulled in and it was busy which was expected for a Friday night. We walked in and I was overhwlemed by all of the menu items choices. 

We settled on two dozen wings (garlic parm, and some  type of spicy bbq) a mushroom burger, and a western bacon cheeseburger. The burgers were $5 each, which also included French fries. I believe our total was about $26 for all items. 

We decided to dine in and quickly grabbed a table because they were almost full. There is tons of interesting decore that reminded me that I was in a antique shop. We sat near the bathroom that is right by the front ordering counter. There is package station for leftovers which was helpful because they were busy with customers the whole time we were there. There is also hot sauce and ketchup bottles at the station, a few arcade games and a flat screen tv in the back, and a few trivia card games on a few of the tables.

The food came out to our table quickly. The wings were plump and flavorful. Finally, we found some wings that didn't skimp on the meat. The wings came with sides of ranch and carrot sticks. The burgers were awesome. The French fries were soooo tasty. I love this place and will be returning in the future. 

Recap
*Great food

*polite employees
*busy but worth it
*writing this review is making me hungry"}
{"text":"i was driving home, starving, but soo hungry i was shaking, i dont like fast food chains, like McDonalds.. Burger King, so i decided to stop in , figured it would be quick,, its only a few blocks from my home, no one was waiting in line, except me, and i was asked as soon as i walked in the door, what u want? didnt even gt much of a chance to look at the menu. what i did see, were 3 oz burgers for 5.95, didnt hold my intereset so i ordered a hot dog, 5.95 for a grilled hot dog, the grilling was nice, the dog tasteless,  an over expensive hole in the wall as far as i can see,, i wont be back to look at the erst of the menu,, if they r going to be bad and overpriced, at least they could be nice, ther was only about 3 ppl sitting in the dining area, u want a good hot dog, head to Costco, where its 1.50 and comes with a drink,, 5,95 for a tasteless dog, and it didnt come with fries chips nada, bye bye, better tasting dogs on meals on wheels, if i could  post 0 stars i would"}
{"text":"Called in an order was told will be ready in 20 mins.  Get here and have to wait 20 mins.  Food wasn't even ready......what's the point of calling in an order if it ain't ready."}
{"text":"I typically enjoyed coming here to purchase only their hot wings. I loved how there were no frills, just good wings. However, the last time we came, the wings were horrible. They were SMOTHERED in hot sauce, so much that we could not finish them. I wouldn't be surprised if the chicken was boiled-not fried-in that mess. They have also increased their prices. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Order the wings. Gold flavor is the best ever. I want to marry into the family that owns this recipe for the gold sauce for the wings just to I can steal it and sell it for millions."}
{"text":"Nothing makes me more angry than to get food to go and drive 20 mins home, just to find out they didn't complete your order!!! 
Our usual spot is ATL and will continue to be our spot. We decided to try something different. We walked in tonight and it was busy so that's good. As we ordered our food: dozen wings (half mango hab and half honey garlic) 1/2 dozen wings (medium) with fries, jalapeño poppers, dragon Wong, and a large cherry Pepsi. 
Strike one: fountain machine was down. So only bottled crush or lemonade was available. 
Strike two: as we waited for our order, after we paid, we got told they were out of chili so she asked my husband if we wanted something else. So he ordered a less expensive hot dog. Wasn't offered a refund for the price difference. 
Strike three/final: we drive 20 mins home, open our food just to find 1/2 dozen wings were missing! 
The two wing flavors we had were tasty!! But the rest was just disappointing. Back to ATL we go."}
{"text":"I'm currently in the middle of a rigorously controlled scientific experiment...it involves subjecting a \"youngish\" middle aged man to periods of intense physical exercise to \"detoxify\" him and then \"retoxifying\" him with things like Long Wong hot dogs and wings, mere moments later:)

After Power Yoga on Friday, I really needed to \"tox up\" and I met a buddy at Long Wongs.

I had my standard...2 Long Wongs and a frosty diet beverage, and my buddy got a dozen spicy and a dozen teryaki wings (and I thought I could eat:)

I had not tried the wings before, so I did end up \"helping\" to dispose of them:)

I am not generally a major fan of wings, but these little chicken parts were really good...esp. the teryaki wings...wonderfully deep teryaki flavor and a nice heat to go with it:)

And, in a major coup for a real \"hole in the wall\" kind of place...they proudly display the \"Gold Award  - Zero Violations\" from their last health inspection...I always knew they were clean as whistle...even though I can still smell the urinal cakes:) 

Let's take them to 4 stars for the terrific teryaki wings:-)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The wings are great. The cheeseburgers are very simple yet so tasty. A neighborhood staple."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you have nothing else to do in your day. Got here at 1230. Had to chase down apparently the only person working here at 1250 to take my order. Pizza and wings, nothing crazy. Now it's 130pm and my food still hasn't come up.  Go to grandpa's pizza instead."}
{"text":"My husband and I are the biggest wing fans you'll meet.  We've tried a lot of places, and by far - this is my favorite.  They make their wings a little crispy, but I love that.

GREAT food, fast service."}
{"text":"Great burgers and also amazing delicious wings also had there zucchini and they were yummy"}
{"text":"Wings were good!  Don't expect much in the establishment itself or server disposition. If you're simply looking for good, crispy wings this is your place!"}
{"text":"The best wings ever and I do not through \"ever\" around. Seriously, these are flipping amazing, I highly recommend them. This is one of those very unassuming places that you will keep on coming back over and over again. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"The wait is way to long and the workers don't seem to be happy so i switched to pizza 87 which is right across the way the owner there is down to earth always has a smile on his face and the food is great the pizza and all the food is fresh and deliciou!!!!!!! I recommend Pizza 87 longs wongs needs help in customer service skills!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is garbage from top to bottom... Always filthy, horrible customer service and sloppily prepared food. You think with all these horrible attributes they would have cheap food... Guess again it's super expensive. I went in for lunch the other day and got 10 wings and a drink and it was $14. Girls that work there act like you inconvenience them by ordering something would you walk in the door. Gang graffiti all over the bathroom... This place is a dump"}
{"text":"Best wings in Arizona!! I always bring out of town family members and they LOVE it!!! We come straight from the airport to get these wings. Now that they accept credit cards it makes it so much better!!"}
{"text":"Too bad my lowest option is 1 star. The food is so awful that I would give it 0.25 of a star. Mainly cause it's still edible. Just not even enjoyable. The wings are so dry. Been going here since high school, and I would never go back again."}
{"text":"First time I ate there will be my last. The wings were mediocre tasting and were very small in size. I also ordered an overpriced burger that was sub-par to McDonalds. Maybe it's not like this at the other locations but I'm not willing to chance it. I'll just stick with Zipps for wings and burgers."}
