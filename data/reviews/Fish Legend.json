{"text":"surprisingly, they are opening until June 26 2016 due to end of contract... They are looking for new location, cant wait to visit them again after tonight ~~~ I really like the spicy fish and lobsters  ~~ highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"One of my friends kept telling me about this place so many times and she also emphasized how tasty and delicious of the spicy fish... Finally we came to this restaurant for our dinner on last Friday. Personally, I like eating fish so much rather than beef, but not too spicy. Ultimately, we ordered one Szechwan style grilled fish(Tilapia) 2 lbs with mild spicy hot pot for two people. Added with some side orders of mushroom, squash and taro noodles. Unexpectedly, the food came out on the table really fast. The fish was so big and it looked so yummy in the hot pot. We couldn't wait to taste it and it was so good that we couldn't stop eating. I will definitely come back when I feel like to eat fish with less spicy...."}
{"text":"tried 3 dishes: spicy \"dry wok\" bull frog, spicy and sour vermicelli, and pan-fried chive dumplings.  there were ~3 frogs in total in the first dish; ~50% of the volume was ginger, chili, and onion. there was no sliced lotus or potato, which are commonly found in this dish.  spicy and sour vermicelli was not authentic, missing many key condiments. the only condiment present, boiled soy beans, were undercooked.  chive dumplings were ok. will not visit again  (if you check my other reviews, you'll know that i'm very generous in rating)"}
{"text":"Not authentic spicy fish. And is pricy too. I ended up paying 50 dollars for one dish."}
{"text":"It was really good! Authentic.  Can adjust spicy level and just tell the check,  Reasonable price. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Service My family and I always eat Chinese, Korean, or Japanese food so when we came to this restaurant, it was like wtf (in a good way). Honestly everything here is spicy lol but the waiter was very patient and explained the dishes in detail to us. Please note that they are more fluent in Mandarin, as opposed to Cantonese.  Food Crab roe tofu with Chinese cabbage Just want to say that this is the neatest thing I've tried this year in terms of a veggie dish. If you are familiar with the salty egg then you will know that the sauce is made from its yolk (specifically speaking it's several yolks combined together). The tofu and cabbage totally absorbs the taste but it's not so salty that you are gasping for water. Just mix the dish a bit to reveal the cabbage hiding underneath!  Crispy sweet and sour pork The sauce is the perfect combination of sweet and sour, it's extremely sticky too. My only complaint is that the pork is too thin lols, well actually there is too much dough and not enough content.  Boiling sliced fish (or fish in boiling chili sauce) As my description depicts, imagine a fish all sliced up and sitting in a bowl of hot chili sauce. We did not order the catfish but something else (sorry forgot). It's honestly a bit pricey, fairing at $23 per bowl. After eating a few pieces you will feel a numbing sensation at the back of your tongue. There are some bones in the fish still but very thin and few. I recommend drinking tea throughout this dish LOL."}
{"text":"The Spicy and Sour Noodle Soup contained transparent vermicelli noodles with preserved vegetables, nuts, cabbage, and chili oil.  The type of spice that they used here is the \"ma la\" numbing spice type.  That means that after you slurp up some of the noodles, you will get a numbing sensation in your mouth.  It's quite special!  After that, the spice doesn't linger in your mouth -- it's a good type of spice!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of 3 to this restaurant fish legend, to try their sichuan style fish. The restaurant decor is modern and comfortable.  and we ordered a variety of dishes, including some cold dishes, and the hot pot fish that their special at.  The cold dishes overall was not bad, the lotus roots was very good, it was sweet but very refreshing. The chilie oil noodles however was average, it was not very flavourful.   the Crispy sweet and sour pork, had good presentation value, however it is not a n amazing dish. it does not standout from all the other dishes you can commonly get elsewhere. and i find too little meat was in it, and mostly fried powder.   The most important dish of all was the hot pot fish, i believe the Fish was done well, and was within expectations. it is worth the try, it is not too spicy or too bland, it has the correct amount of flavors. the food was fresh in the fish which is very important for this dish.   The food in this place does deserve a 4 star if it is just the food we are rating. However the service was terrible at this place, which ruins a lot of the it. the waitress gave our table a big lecture over us asking for water twice. telling us we are wasting her time. and this is unacceptable at any restaurant. so unfortunately i have to downgrade them to 3 star for this reason.  if they fix their service it will definetely be a solid 4 star"}
{"text":"Even though I was tearing up while munching down spicy food throughout the meal I gotta give this restaurant a good old 5 star rating!!!  My group of 10 ordered a bunch of food, including their signature spicy crab and fresh fish in spicy soup/oil. Unfortunately the spicy prawn shrimp wasn't available, I was really devastated. I usually don't eat spicy food but I made an exception that night because the food was AMAZING.   The crab was crunchy and you could easily bite through the shell. The meat was fresh and sweet, you could tell the crab was alive because they were cooked. The fish was really good too, one of the best of that dish I have ever tried. The fish was also really fresh, not like the other restaurants that uses cheap frozen tilapia fillet. This one had bones still in and the meat was really soft and tender. The broth was so oily though, you really need to drain it because you take a bite of the fish. We also ordered a pumpkin sticks covered in egg yolk, also really good and I highly recommend.  This restaurant is packed on weekend nights so make sure to make a reservation ahead of time."}
{"text":"it's way to oily, although the fish is very fresh, me and my friend got more pimples after eating it. Might not order the boiling fish again, the price for 3lbs boiling fish is around 40$, the regular dishes are good."}
{"text":"Came to this place on a whim.  Plus it was Valentine's day with my wife.  She did the ordering as I can't read Chinese and I'm wary of the translations on the menu.   Overall very good experience. Staff were extremely pleasant and helpful in tweaking our selection.   Can't remember exactly what was ordered except it was infernal spicy.  My wife ordered \"hot\" that was just above \"mild\" on the menu.  The fish I believe was tilapia, and there was lots of it. The hot pot was about the size of a standard wok. Half of the pot was all peppers (try not to chomp down on the little seeds), the other half was bean sprouts. There was so much fish, I have to say it was really good. So the fish would have been the topping to the pepper/bean sprout soup mix.   After our eyes stopped watering and blowing noses, we paid for our fare and left for our next stop.  Dessert!"}
{"text":"Dropped in here to say the spicy chili oil pot with grilled fish is so hot, almost cried, blew my nose like crazy.  I like hot but this was beyond hot it was lunacy. I enjoyed it though. It was definitely tasty but couldn't feel my mouth after."}
{"text":"Another Sichuan restaurant?   Another restaurant that specialized in Grilled Fish?  I don't know how legendary their fish is but the menu for sure is just ordinary.  Hot and Sour Noodle ($6.99) lacked the punch for spiciness and lack the sourness.   Wait staff though friendly and efficient and most of them can speak both Cantonese and Mandarin.   I might be back to try the Spicy Clams and hopefully they would be spicy enough!"}
{"text":"Fish is very tender but overpriced. We have ordered the boiling fish, grilled shrimps in a pot, salty egg cabbages *(this one is really good)"}
