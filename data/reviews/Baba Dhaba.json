{"text":"Simply 5 stars for the food, one of the best restaurant which serves authentic Punjabi dhaba food. Been there 2 and it's been consistent with taste. 
Waiting time is long and by the time food is served it could be a while. But the wait is worth while on the first bite. Even for take out they recommend 40 - 50 min wait
Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food ! they make it fresh and are open late ! make sure to call in before you go as they close early if its not busy."}
{"text":"If what you care about is not  ambience but authentic Indian food, this is the rite place. Fresh food always and friendly staff. Im a regular now."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and taste of most dishes is close to costly restaurants. The only thing missing is the interior of the restaurant. It is great for takeout. It is gem and there is no doubt about that."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite place for Indian food. Everythings made to order freshly as their tagline suggests !!!!"}
{"text":"Initially I was put off by the dirty dining environment and somewhat shoddy service. However, I then realized that the main selling point of this place is the food. It is honestly some of the best Indian food to be had in Brampton, and perhaps the only reason why I somehow end up going back there every week."}
{"text":"Food okay.  Place smelled like strong disinfectant cleaner.  Lady was sweeping the floor with so much dirt in her pile made me wonder if the floor had ever been cleaned.  Lots of flies throughout restaurant, bottle of insect killer spray on counter near drink, cash register area.  Staff nice and helpful, I would not go back due to lack of cleanliness.  I ordered take out, I would never eat in such a place."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I couldn't stop eating it. My friends and I ordered daal makhani and paneer tikka masala and both tasted amazing. The people working there are really nice too. The place is not nice looking but the food is amazing. Oh and did I mention it's open until late so more eating pizza and McDonald's when I am hungry late at night."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and I must say best and fresh Indian food at such reasonable price in entire North America that we have tried. Ordered Dal Makhani, Paneer Tikka Masala, Onion Kulcha, Naan, tandoori roti( never had this good before and I reordered) to finish with we ordered Gilar Jamuns and this blew us since they were so fresh reminded me of back home India. We asked for the chef and congratulated him for such great food and how much we appreciate his cooking. He was super nice and polite. Highly recommend this place and really hope that they maintain the quality."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely yummy! Found this place searching on yelp review and it didn't disappoint. However, I gave 4 stars because when you walk in it looks super ghetto"}
{"text":"Very tasty and good portion sizes. Recommend ordering well in advance for pick up orders."}
{"text":"First of all let me start by say I g that I loved the fact that this dhaba is open late like 2 or 3 am...which i love.
I was leaving for st catharines that night after staying in a hotel so I ordered a couple of things.
The only thing I did not like we that the chicken Tikka Masala has A LOT of onions. Like A LOT.
I ordered biryani and it was good. Nan was good too.
The girls working late were efficient and friendly. 
The order took about 15 minutes to be ready."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant with yummy food
It reminded me of what the original taste of food is.
We had chicken tikka, daal tadka , chicken kadhai.. they were so tasty"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at this hole in the wall place. The food was authentic, flavorful, very reasonable, and the staff were gracious. We would definitely come back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"and thats how Shahi Paneer is made...they call it Paneer Makhni,though.Perfect gravy,correctly sweetened,soft cheese.And their 'Baingan Bharta' is actually 'Bharta' you can taste and tell.Unlike other dumps of poorly mixed vegetables that are not true to their name.Very well cooked dishes and good quantity too so you are not under served.Someone rightly said in the comments here,it IS  a hidden gem.Hands down,this is the best Indian food joint...why 4 stars not 5? No salad or onions and green chillies that go with Indian food in a dhaba.Plus I didnt get cutlery and tissues.It was a take out...sadly no Indian restaurant gives you spoon or tissues.They cheap out on that.You always have to ask and it should not be so!! These are basic dining etiquette.Please dont forget."}
{"text":"Drove from Toronto to try this place out based on price and review, and was 100% satisfied. The portions were huge, prices were good, service was great and food was fresh. 

I went around 7 during the week so it was very quiet because they do most of their business at night; but that only means our food was the freshest :-) 

Location is close to the highway, so relatively easy to get to. Not the most approachable aesthetically, but believe me it's worth it.  

Will recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. I never had a punjabi food as good as this place. If you are vising town or live in Toronto definetly visit this place. It is absolutely delight to eat in this place.

Location is not very friendly to dine in but still their customer service is on par with really good restaurant. 

BUT LET ME STOP YOU HERE IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO SPEND MONEY AND GET NICE SERVICE THAN THIS PLACE IS NOT FOR YOU. 

This place is like eating in a Authentic Five Star Indian restaurant with lots of flavor flowing through your mouth. 

Their Paneer Tikka Masala is not like any tradition punjabi curry where you will see loads of tomato and onion gravy and few Paneer cubes, Their dishes are with real ingradients and you feel aroma of every different spice and vegetable in the place. 

Their Bhindi Masala is also really good, If you have not eat Bhindi Masala then I bet you are missing something. Do order this here."}
{"text":"Worst place. Too slow. Really disgusting place. All of them using the same cloth to clean the floor and tables and then with those untidy hands they are giving people plates, spoons and food. Oh god... have mercy on these people who love this place"}
{"text":"Will give this a 4****
The good was good, the ambience was okay.
The time taken to prepare was a little longer"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken tikka masala. The gravy(sauce) was good, but not spicy enough. The chicken itself in the sauce was horrible. It was seasoned ok but the texture was like no other chicken i ever had(in a bad way) Some pieces tasted and fealt fine but some pieces were horrible. i have had better chicken from here before but today i was dissapointed, Hopefully the Chicken Tikka Masala which is my favorite item has better tasting chicken. I love the sauce"}
{"text":"Pretty good, with most of the 'hits' you'd hope for in Punjabi food. Perhaps wasn't quite as good as some of the other reviews got me excited for; however still pretty strong overall. We ordered 7-8 dishes and all but one veggie dish was a hit with everyone. I also like how their butter chicken is spicier than other places too."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers!! Not as much as a hole in the wall as many stated, but far from fine dining.  If you ever wanted to taste the famous Indian food found on road sides in India, now's your chance. The flavours and options are more what grandma used to make rather than what you would find in a restaurant.

Just found my new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"The decor is very basic and it could really do with some decorating, but the food is great. The nan was excellent and our server helpful in our selections.
Wish I had discovered it years ago."}
{"text":"This place is true to its name. It really does serve the kind of food one gets at a dhaba."}
{"text":"Food is really good! Worth the price but its a small lil place just like a dhaba! The staff is polite and good customer service. They can do awesome if they work on ambience! I will visit again n again because of the food and timings, but will always prefer take out!"}
{"text":"Ordered two chicken and two veg gravies , food was for sure good and authentic . Kadai chicken was yum and flavourful ."}
{"text":"This is not a Family restaurant at all. Don't expect any good services from their end. It's mainly a takeaway restaurant, with economical food rate.

Food quality is good, but not sure about the hygiene.

I won't suggest to go with family."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Truely indian taste. Will go again. Though waited almost 40 mins for food due to a rush of customers, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best India food ever had in Canada it tastes like the real DHABA in India.
Love this Place"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Indian restaurant. Food is awesome. Taste is great. Only thing missing is ambiance but authentic Indian taste will not let you miss that.
Will keep going back there."}
{"text":"Worst Restaurant ever i visited in my life. I got a huge silver wire in my food.  When i called the restaurant they refused to accept their mistake.  I wish i can sue them for this. God bless all their customers."}
{"text":"Honestly this place took me by surprise. First bite and it brought me back to old fashioned Punjabi Dhaba (roadside restaurant)food. An that is a very good thing. The bbq Salmon is delicious. Served with some spicy green chutney as it should be. The Keema (mince meat) naan was by far one of the best I've had anywhere around here. Warm perfectly cooked naan. Delicious dal (lentils), paneer (cottage cheese) dishes. Biryani was fantastic. Albiet the goat curry was a little over done but manageable. 

Like mentioned previously, ambiance is the least of their concerns. Minimalist-1. Student friendly atmosphere and cheap.  Food may take time to come through. Worth the wait. Open till 2 am! Late night grub! Hole in the wall worth visiting again"}
{"text":"First time here.  Awesome experience. Great staff, the young girls working here were so attentive and informative. 
We got take out, and it was delicious. 
We orders naan and roti which were warm and fresh.  We also ordered butter chicken, palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, and chicken biryani. Great food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fresh food, the chef's and staff are really friendly. A unique place to try in the GTA."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow!!   The food at this place is out of this world.  My new favorite Indian restaurant!  Can't wait to try the whole menu!  :)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem located in Brampton's industrial area (Rutherford and Glidden). Food is authentic Dhaba style. (Dhaba = highway/roadside eatery). Takes a while for them to prepare food, but it's worth the wait. Chana Masala, Kofta, Baingan Bharta are veg favourites along with Garlic Naan. Tadka Daal is also very delicious. The ambience is downmarket, but family friendly. Prices are very reasonable. Must try for those who crave typical Dhaba food that's open late on weekends."}
{"text":"It is a very cozy place. Minimal investment to the decore was obvious. I don't think the chairs matched at our table. 
The plates and utensils were almost clean. And the water tasted a little off.  There were tonnes mosquitos. Be prepared!!
With that said... the food was authentic!  Which is the most important part of dinning out! I saw them make everything in the back. There were 2- 3 cooks. And they each specialized in something. It took no time for the food. 
Will definitely go back for takeouts."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. My wife is an Indian chef and she came across this place. This is quality Indian food and has good reviews for a reason. Authentically prepared with flavour. We highly recommend for your next take out. Hole in the wall, with amazing food."}
{"text":"The Best goat curry.  Period.  In the world.  Thank goodness we found this place while staying in Brampton on business."}
