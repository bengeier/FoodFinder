{"text":"I was In the area and spotted this new crepe shop. Tried Mango mille & OMG it was soo good. Toasted coconut gave crepe another dimension. Crepe batter was soo tasty as well. Not overly sweet. I will definitely go back for some more."}
{"text":"Creme brûlée crepe - I got this when I came here the first time, it's their most popular item. Although their menu don't have a variety of choice, but each of them is very unique. The creme brûlée was delicious and not over sweet. 

Mixed fruit tea- this is very refreshing, it has a good balance of sweetness. 

Overall, this is my new spot for desserts and drinks."}
{"text":"I tried strawberry cream first and it was delicious. I added strawberry ice cream then and which was ok. Yet second time, I ordered cream de brûlée that looked so good in the pictures. That was a bomb!!! Generous amount of both cream and slices of strawberries. Interesting combination. Since their rival Suzuya stop serving crepe, I will come back here more often;)"}
{"text":"This place is my fav Crepe place in town hands down. The crepes are soft, not overwhelmingly sweet. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"I'm quite picky with crepes after being let down by the crepe spots here in Vegas. But this is definitely my new favorite crepe place here. Very delicious and I highly recommend it for anyone who loves crepes. Also, their drinks were delicious! I love their lemonade!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Customer service was very friendly. Gave suggestions and made sure we were happy with what we had ordered. 
Crepes were fantastic. Combinations were delicious. Very much reminded me of some of the crepes we got while in Tokyo just a few months ago"}
{"text":"The crepes had a very distinct and pleasant flavor. For someone who isn't a fan of overwhelming sweetness, it hit the spot. The teas were absolutely amazing, specifically the mixed fruit tea. The fruits made a huge impact and the natural flavor of the tea."}
{"text":"This place is right next to cafe darak and just opened a month ago! It's gorgeous as soon as you walk in. The menu is simple and the add ons are with it! I got the matcha truffle crepe and I added vanilla ice cream. So so good. In this Vegas heat, you want something refreshing, yummy, and light. This checks all of them!! Even though I had ice cream and little chunks of ice cream, it was so satisfying- I didn't feel so groggy. 

Check this place out! The pricing for the crepes range between 6 to 8 dollars before any add ons! It's a pretty comparably cheaper price than to most shops/cafes I've been to"}
{"text":"I love crepes but haven't really found a go to place until today.  We ordered the creme brulee, nutellnana and oreo swirl. They were all delicious and not overly sweet. Great presentation too. I prefer crepes that are wrapped instead of on a plate. The infused tea was very refreshing. This will be the perfect drink for the hot summer days ahead. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the creme brûlée crepe. Tasted like heaven. Never had a such good dessert experience before. Their drinks also looks nice. I'll try it next time!!"}
{"text":"a great up and coming business with a clean minimalist principle and design. Their crepes have a simple yet delicious combination of flavors, mixing within your mouth with their fresh cream cushioning different flavors entering your mouth. I order the sparkling lemonade refresher and the strawberry infused fruit tea. Both took quite a while to make. Overall I really enjoyed this place and would come back."}
{"text":"My favorite crepes in town. You should try their drinks too.
The creme Brule crepe is the best!"}
{"text":"My friends and I tried this place out and it was pretty good. The place is simply decorated. When we first walked in, the smell of the crepes was really pleasant. We got the creme brûlée, matcha truffle, and fruity Nutella crepes. They were all pretty good. I like the matcha truffle the most. I got a strawberry yogurt smoothie and it was too sour. I didn't like it too much. It is definitely worth a try if you haven't tried it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! The dessert crepes are as delicious as expected but the savory crepes are amazing too. I actually crave the ham and cheese crepe all the time now. Highly recommend!! Restaurant is clean and staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I feel pretty down about it but I have to give this place 3.5 stars. 

First and foremost, my sister and I walked in feeling unwelcome. The two employees did not crack a smile and just stared at us. It seemed as though we interrupted a deep conversation. As awkward as it got, we both looked at the menu before ordering and the guy didn't explain the menu. I tried ordering the Mont Blanc which consists of chestnut cream, strawberries, and wafers. The employee said they were out. 
He then suggested the crème brûlée crêpe but I opted for the Mango Mille crêpe and my sister chose the Oreo Swirl with Matcha ice cream. He asked if we wanted toppings and we were confused because the ice cream is under toppings. I could tell he got irritated and asked us if we were getting any drinks. It's kind of like asking me if I want a side of fries with my order. If he wanted me to get a drink, he could have did a quick run through of the menu. Maybe suggest what has been popular rather than trying to have us spend more. With tip, the two crêpes came out to $17. 

Oreo Swirl: The crêpe itself was nice and thick. It was layered with Nutella and cream. The scoop of Matcha ice cream was delicious.

Mango Mille: The mangoes were sweet and the cream paired very well with it. The crunch from the toasted coconut gave the crêpe some nice texture. 

The crêpes are great but the customer service needs some work."}
{"text":"Really freakin good. I went twice in one week. Both the crepes and the drinks are amazing, I got the oreo swirl and its everything I love in one. The crepes are super soft and a good side to me personally. Best crepes Ive had in town."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to hangout, they have the best fruit tea and crepes in town. Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Creme Brûlée and it was delicious! It was made with freshly cut strawberries with a creme that was not too sweet! The creme was just right. She also add a crunchy sprinkle inside the crepe. My spouse ordered the crunchy PB and that was amazingly good! Crunchy peanut butter with fresh strawberries! Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite dessert place. I love the creme brûlée crepe. It is so soft and melt in your mouth. Even my 3 years old love it. The place is very clean and comfortable. It's a good place for afternoon teatime. The boss is really nice. I will definitely recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Are you craving one of those Asian style crepes? Then this is the place to go! I think they just recently opened, but when we went, the seats were all full. Their potions are perfect, and they have so many different flavors.
The service was great, staff were super friendly and we also got free matcha ice cream. All in all, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Excellent Japanese style crepes really good. They have a menu and you can also create your own. My favorite are the creme brûlée and the fruitella. The creme brûlée is extremely delicious."}
{"text":"My girlfriend wanted have some desserts after dinner, so we found this new place on yelp. The cashier suggested us the Creme brûlée crepe, which is their most popular item. We also ordered the strawberry cream and pineapple cheese cap smoothie. There were few people ahead us, so we waited like about 15mins to get our orders. 

Creme brûlée - the presentation was great, the cream tasted fresh and not too sweet, I love how they added some crunchiness in the crepe. The creme brûlée itself was delicious, it came out with a little warmness. The crepe overall was not too sweet which is perfect for me. 

Strawberry Cream- the cream and strawberry are both tasted very fresh, but I would add some toppings with this one next time. Their crepe is not traditional soft crepes, it was little crunchy on the edge and chewy at the bottom, and I can tasted the smell of butter in the crepe. 

Pineapple cheese cap- I was surprised that pineapple smoothie goes very well with jasmine green tea. I can tell they used fresh pineapple, this is my favorite drink now. 

Overall, this place is great, but you just have to wait for a bit if they get busy, as they only have two employees. I will definitely come back next time to try out other flavors."}
{"text":"The crepe is excellent. Not that sweet. Really like it. Strawberry milk and orange yogurt are also impressive."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVEEEE this place! Great flavors and so fresh. A lot of selection and additions that you can add on.. the only thing that I'm not crazy about is that it comes in a cone rather than a plate. BUT no worries, they will happily put it on a plate if you prefer. 

Must try!"}
{"text":"Wow. What an interesting idea. Ice cream cone shaped crepes!  They are amazing. The sweet fresh cream they use here as a filler is so tasty I wish I could order it by the quart. Lol. With a minimalist interior, the highlight of this place, is the friendly smiles, wonderful service and one of the most unique foods you can get in Las Vegas. I highly recommend the creme brûlée or the strawberry's and cream. Jesus just writing this makes my mouth water."}
{"text":"Taste delicious! definitely the best crepe in town. If you think the crepe in fashion show mall is good. Try this. Better in my opinion. Not the best picture. The size about a 500 mL water bottle. Definitely try it if u like sweet."}
{"text":"First time here. This place is fairly new. Guy and gal at the counter provided good customer service. I ordered the matcha crepe with sliced almonds, no green tea ice cream. It smelled delicious and looked so pretty. The presentation in the glass milk bottle was a nice touch. The taste matched the look. It was delicious. The strawberries were fresh and the cream added the perfect sweetness. I like that it's not so sweet that I would feel as if I just lost half my teeth. All in all the different layers of flavors complemented each other. The one star missing is for the decor. No decorations on the wall, maybe they're still trying to figure it out. Come for the crepes though, they are delicious!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite place to visit so far in Vegas! The crepes are absolutely delicious. I had the creme brule crepe with matcha sauce! Might have to come back once more during my visit because it was so good!"}
{"text":"The newest crepe place in town! Offers variety of crepe options, both sweet and savory. Also offers many drink choices. Best dessert place for this summer. Great ambiance and friendly staff. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife decided to stop by this new opening place, and their crepes were divine! We are surprised that it's the best crepes we have had so far!"}
{"text":"em.....little upset because it doesn't come with ice cream.   It looks different with the reviewer's pic. And no one tell us the ice cream thing when we order. Taste is not bad though. And I don't think it worth without ice cream:((((("}
{"text":"Very delicious crepes and drinks! All FRESH make. The place is very comfortable, owner Sisi is very friendly. The best Crepe I ever have! Must go!"}
{"text":"Strawberry organic milk  are delicious, crepes are very tasty best crepes i ever had. Nutella banana is my favor crepes. Nice music in the store, you must check it out."}
{"text":"If you want your Crêpe soft and flavorful then this is the place to go. They have wide variety of flavor to choose from. The place is also great for family and kids."}
{"text":"I thought I know crepe before I came but they really surprised me! I ordered Mount Blanc and it sure did not disappoint. Balance of flavors and texture including chestnut mousse and crispy waffle crunch with fresh homemade cream and fresh seasonal fruits. I usually eat savory crepes but this really caught my attention. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Pictures just doesn't do this place justice. I had the Creme Brulee Crepe and my little brother had the Nutellnana w/ strawberry ice cream. Both were amazingly delicious. Definitely my new favorite spot for my Crepe Cravings!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of crepes, but this place definitely deserves to be the best crepe in Las Vegas. Most crepes are tend to be over sweet with the syrup or too hard on the crepe wrap, but this place has the perfect balance of fruit, and syrup, even someone who doesn't have a sweet tooth will find it tasteful and refreshing. For sure it will be the # 1 place for a taste of sweet."}
{"text":"Great smoothies but the Crepe's are Amazing!!

We had the Ham and Cheese and it was great! For sweet we had Creme Brûlée and strawberries and cream! So good I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I got the Nutella strawberry crepe and I bought the ham and cheese for to-go. The sweet crepe was ok(5/10). A little too pricey and quality for the sweet crepe compare to the one on Durango-Warm Springs. However the service was 8/10 nice people, and the savory crepe was worth 7$ (9.5/10), they use really good stuffs. 

Hopefully they do better on the sweet crepe"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in after studying at the cafe next door and it was a great decision! The crepe's were super delicious and the staff was really awesome! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The mixed fruit tea is heaven!  All of the ingredients are really fresh, and the sweet crepes are light, not too sweet.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome crepe !! I LOVE the fact that the crepe are not too sweet.. They are just right. I highly recommend  this crepe place."}
{"text":"My boys and I were looking for a late night dessert spot and saw this place on Yelp so we decided to try it out. It was absolutely delicious. Not overly sweet and a perfect way to end our night."}
{"text":"Creme Brûlée :     * * * * * 
    (Super good~) 

Infused Fruit Tea :     * * * * *
   (Not too sweet, not too bitter = fresh) 

Ham & Cheese :   * * *
   (Okay)

Matcha Truffle :    * * * * 
  (Topped w/matcha ice cream, cuz I checked in lol)"}
{"text":"cute! the crepe comes in a little glass bottle. the drinks come with a little heart shaped stopper."}
{"text":"A new crepe spot that just opened right on Durango. Really clean and brand new furnish. This place is next to our favorite cafe, Café Darak. This place gave a good vibe, but their menu threw it all off. We ordered the Cremé Brûlée crepe. I give it a 3/5, not much flavor to it and it just didn't blow my mind for something different to try. Also ordered the Matcha Truffle crepe, it was 2/5. It lacked a lot of toppings to balance with the crepe itself. Felt like I was just eating batter. 

Now for the drinks the mango cheese cap could've been better it was a 3/5 for me. The cheese cap was good but the mango just wasn't sweet enough for me. 
The mixed fruit infused drink wasn't just for me, I give it a 1/5 I should've just made it at home myself. 

I wish I can give this place a better review but this is I feel about my visit here. The lady that works in the front needs to be more friendly, and upright. This place tends to be a little pricey for me, but it's worth it for some people out there."}
{"text":"I felt in love with the creme brule crepe! It's so fresh and the sweetness is on point. The place is so beautiful and I'll definitely come back to try the nutella crepe!"}
{"text":"was really good!! The crepes aren't overwhelmingly sweet but just right ALSO try the strawberry tea it's SOSOSOSO good w out a doubt I LUV IT"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow! This is the best Crepe place I have ever eaten at. The filling in as fresh and very flavorful!"}
{"text":"The sweetness of the drinks are perfect. And they tasted amazing. The mixed fruit tea was super refresh. I had the creme brûlée crepe. It was the best dessert I've ever had. And nice design of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ahh what an absolute blessing to this side of town, a yummy crepe shop. I came over here after having a disappointing crepe else where for breakfast. 

After seeing a post about crème brûlée crepes going around Facebook, I found out that we have one here in Las Vegas only a five minute drive from my house! I definitely had to go there.

The cafe has a very cute ambience to it. The service was also on point. I got a crème brûlée crepe and an infused fruit tea. The crepe was delicious! I devoured it in seconds. It was everything you love about crème brûlée plus more a.k.a. the crepe side haha. The infused fruit tea was also very good. It was the perfect refreshing drink for this hot day. 

I highly recommend this place for a tasty dessert! I'm in love with the crème brûlée crepe so make sure you try that one. I'm excited to try the other ones too."}
