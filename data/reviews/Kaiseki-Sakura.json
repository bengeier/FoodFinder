{"text":"Very interesting approach. Plating is delicate and refined. ingredients are fresh and the chef is very creative. sake list is good. the place is rather small and although place is enjoyable, its pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"Yes, it's the best restaurant in the village and one of the best in the city. Our five course omakase ranged from exquisite uni, scallop and grouper sashimi to the signature tongue to the mind boggling main which has ten different perfect things on it. Omakase can leave you bloated but this was just right. Dinner was accompanied by a very thoughtful matching four course sake taster. Don't miss the sake cocktails too! Service was a delight, the decor understated and tasteful, the presentation of the food exquisite. Not cheap and worth every penny. A meal to remember, a Toronto treasure!"}
{"text":"I hesitate to write a review of this restaurant because I don't want too many people to eat here.  This is an unusual establishment and I've joked that I almost need to ask for another receipt so that I can claim it as a medical expense, as though restaurants like these are equal to Shiatsu massage and psychotherapy.  The establishment is small and contemporary. Japanese expats regularly sit at the bar toward the front while a mixed crowd quietly enjoys their dinner at the back of the restaurant. There are only 10 tables, and the staff is professional, courteous and extremely friendly and interested in ensuring that their customers enjoy their food.  The sake list is extensive, and can be quite expensive. Try one of their sparkling sakes.   I agree with the other reviews and won't add to their accurate depictions of what is on offer. In addition to the omikase, there are daily specials which are worth enquiring about. Yes, this is an expensive restaurant, but the difference in price is certainly worth it as you will not easily find a restaurant of this calibre anywhere else in Toronto. And yes, this place can be compared to Hashimoto's and Kaji's, but the chef is young, and the crowd is a more urbane, youthful, Japanese-expat kind of group that you won't necessarily see at Sushi Kaji."}
{"text":"If you love Japanese food or any new food experience you should go to Kaiseki Sakura.  Why?  Well the owner and chef Daisuke Izutsu was the chef to the Japanese Consul General for 5 years and decided to stay and share his passion for true Japanese cuisine.  What you will not find is the maki roll, the sushi combo or many oily fried items.  What you will discover if you go is an appreciation for what Japanese cuisine really is.  Japanese chefs are attentive, strict food artists who strive to offer the best and highest quality for each and every dish they create.  In Toronto you will find only a handful of true Japanese chefs and their restaurants.  Kaiseki Sakura is one of these.        Kaiseki Sakura is a method of serving many small plates created to accompany Japanese tea ceremonies.  It is a whole experience that upholds the Japanese credo to present only seasonal, high quality ingredients in an artful manner.  This is what you will find at this restaurant.  Nothing but a parade of artful and delicious dishes.  Amberjack sashimi with fresh wasabi you can grade shown in the top left.  So cool.  Going there is a refreshing change from the many disappointing attempts at providing interesting food experiences by other restaurants.  Kaiseki Sakura is small and simply furnished, true to the Japanese style.  15 or so tables dot the floor with a small bar near the front with room for 4.  Soft jazz and classical music fills the room otherwise devoid of sound.   You can order a la carte or as I always say, leave it in the hands of the chef.  I did and as usual went for the Omakase (tasting menu) with the accompanying sake pairing.  The Omakase will run you $80 to $130 a person depending on the amount of desired courses and the season.  The sake pairing will add another $40.  Each dish was a piece of art composed to enlighten the senses and the palate.  Service between each plate was timed perfectly and described in detail by the server.  Staff was attentive and knowledgeable.     This reminds me of a time I came in once for drinks, aiming to sample their extensive sake offering during the winter past.  I was initially looking for my favorite winter drink of Shochu (a distilled Japanese drink) diluted with warm water and a crushed umeboshi (dried plum).  After that, wife of the chef and co-owner Yumi asked me if I was interested in other sakes.  She was gracious and keen to understand my thoughts on the sake.  Her managing this while attending to a full house was positive sign I should return for dinner.  Desert was a beautifully plated shortbread, ice cream and cake roll of which I do not have a picture of for some reason.  Traditional Shabu-Shabu with a bonito broth I tried to finish by drinking from the bowl.  Braised beef tongue.  Rich, tender and required a barrel more.  Cold buckwheat noodles in a sweet broth to stage the dessert.  Let me know if you have eaten Kaiseki Sakura style dining, ate at this restaurant or have an opinion on Japanese cuisine in Toronto."}
{"text":"Wow! This was by far the best Japanese place I have ever been to! Mind you, this was the first expensive Japanese restaurant I've been to, but the food was still absolutely wonderful! We had the cheapest menu which was $80 per person for a 7 course meal. There are two other options for a little more money, but the $80 one satisfied us thoroughly. The food was out if this world good from start to finish. I would go on to write what we had to eat, but I cannot remember the exact names of the things we ate. They do have a la carte items if you don't want to do the whole prix fixe menu.   As for the service, probably the best i've had in toronto. We went on a wednesday evening and were the only ones there at one point, but regardless, as soon as I finished my last sip of sake, the server was there to fill it up again. The server explained each course in detail and was very well knowledged about the items. We sent our compliments and a glass of sake to the chef, and he came out and enjoyed some sake with us.   As for the sake, that is another thing to talk about! It is not your typical warm sake garbage you find at your cheap sushi places. The sake list had about 40 different sakes, and some of which you will not find anywhere in the city. I'm not very big on sake, but my dinner guest was a sake enthusiast. He goes to very fancy Japanese restaurants frequently in his hometown of San Fran Cali. and he has been to japan several times. He actually chose the restaurant based on their sake list and he was thoroughly, and I mean thoroughly impresssed. And let me tell you, it was sake like I have never tasted sake before! Ok, I think I have ranted and raved about Kaiseki-Sakura enough, but go go GO! It would be perfect for a nice date, anniversary, birthday, or any special occassion for people who love authentic japenese cuisine. Well done!!!!"}
{"text":"Kaiseki Sakura has a special set menu on now with part of the proceeds going towered Japan Tsunami relief.  A bargain at $35 and a fantastic way to sample the cuisine at this superb Japanese bo√Æte.  Consistently recommended as one of the finest Japanese restos in the city, K-S is a jewel to be found in the gaybourhood which is full of mediocre eats.   Thanks to a friend who organized a fun social for a group of us, I jumped at the opportunity and left full and vowing to return.  The set menu included a sample of typical Japanese dishes but the kicker is that they all come with a unique and elegant twist which elevates the simple way beyond the standard. e.g. shrimp tempura comes with a dollop of miso sauce, sticky rice flavoured with cherry blossom wrapped in a shiso leaf and sitting in a savoury broth, soba noodles in a mushroom broth topped with an exquisitely creamy poached egg...  Simple dishes, exquisitely rendered all made for a one spectacular sampling meal.  I cant wait to go back to go full on omakase!"}
