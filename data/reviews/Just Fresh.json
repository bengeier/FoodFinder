{"text":"I've had lunch, dinner and brunch here a few times with friends. It is ok, but not great. It never fails that something gets forgotten and doesn't make its way to the table. I have had dishes served that were room temperature. The service is a bit on the slow side. It is a good place to sit back and have a muffin and a cup of coffee while reading the paper. However, I can do that at almost any coffee shop in town. 

They rotate out parts of their menu each season. Which is nice but would be nicer if the food was a bit better. They do a rendition of eggs Benedict right now that is uninspired. Although they try hard to be a bit different, putting ciabatta on the bottom with a Parmesan artichoke spread on it before topping it with ham (not Canadian bacon) then the poached egg (which needs vinegar in the poaching water so they end up with more whites attached to the yolk) then a light hollandaise like sauce. 

The only item I would actually go back for, they took off the menu. If you see the egg white omelette with asparagus and swiss, order it. It does have a nice flavor."}
{"text":"Just as the name states, they're fresh. Fast food and a great atmosphere. I have tried a variety of things from here and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I work in the building and go there quite often, not because it's great, it's just there and they are generally quick. The food is ok and a bit overpriced. The salads are tossed together with general disregard and the breakfast is anything but \"fresh\" 
I haven't tried the Pimento Cheese...maybe soon, but really I only eat there because I know I can get in and out in less than 10 mins."}
{"text":"Just go to their website to see the nutritional information for their products.  Wraps, Sandwiches, and Salads have absurdly high levels of salt and fat.  This is the norm for fast food products; however, if your slogan is \"eat great, feel great\" and you claim to offer healthy foods, I have higher expectations.  The very veggie wrap has 597 calories and 30 grams of fat! That's freaking absurd!!"}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING CHARLOTTE ESTABLISHMENT!!! Just Fresh in the Ally Center could not have better customer service! They have shown me numerous times that this is how a company should be run. They have given me a free smoothie because they felt the minute and a half I waited the week before for my smoothie was too long. This morning I pull out my \"credit card\" to pay for my breakfast burrito and hand the cashier my driver's license (the only thing I had on me)  she said don't worry about it this morning and that I'll get her back next time! A company that runs on good faith, Amazing! I'll definitely be back to pay my tab and to order more delicious food."}
{"text":"Loving this place!  For around $9 you can get a healthy, quality sandwich..side..and a drink.  I've been going here on my lunch break and love it.  I've tried almost every wrap and love it.  It's a healthier alternative that isn't TOO pricey.  They also have really good smoothies for $1.99."}
{"text":"Not a place I would go again.  There was nothing on the menu that really stood out to me.  I was actually there about a year ago and left because the menu seemed blah.  Not sure why I went back!

The star of my lunch was a cucumber pasta salad. Very good.  My sandwich was just plain awful though.  I had the pimento cheese sandwich on cranberry bread.  What they don't tell you is that the cranberry bread is cut to about the size of toast points, so you are served these two teeny tiny sandwiches.  The bread was truly awful and kind of stale.  I asked for my sandwich cold, but when it arrived it was neither cold or hot, just luke warm blah pimento cheese, which was quite spicy.  Spicy pimento cheese drives me bonkers.  The standard recipe for pimento cheese does not have cayenne pepper in it.  Why do restaurants do this?  It was not listed as spicy on the menu.  Ugh.  The whole thing was just gross and my stomach felt a little off for the rest of the afternoon.

If you want this type of food, Panera is a MUCH better choice!"}
{"text":"The nicest staff of any of the downtown lunch places I have visited during my business travels to Charlotte.

The Mexicali sandwich is tasty and warm, with plenty of sauce. Don't miss the yummy cornbread muffins by the cash register!"}
{"text":"Used to be ok ... now its just not good. Last time I went there was food all over the floor and the tables weren't clean. Add to this a less than tasty burger at a high price, and I'm not going back."}
{"text":"The.  Nastiest.  Coffee.  In town.  Period. The food is edible, but overpriced.  Suggest avoid."}
{"text":"I thought it was a fluke the first time I went in Just Fresh a couple months ago. But after coming several times since then, I've noticed that the staff is constantly unfriendly. They are not very patient, never a smile, or a \"thank you\". I love the food here, I just wish the staff was more pleasant to interact with.  

New visit....tried to call a head for take-out and was put on hold for 4 minutes! I hung-up assuming they were busy inside. I called back a minute or two later and it was a busy signal. Tried again, same busy signal. (Eye roll) who doesn't have more than one line?   I arrived to physically walk-in and place my order and there is NO ONE in the building. Just an employee taking on the phone casually (hence it being busy I assume).   This was a very frustrating experience."}
{"text":"Everybody claims fresh ingredients but this is one of the few places where I can actually taste it. The first time I came here I got their chicken sandwich (I forget which one - it's got some really nice spices is all I remember) and have zero need to try anything else it's so good. I've never received a cooked sandwich where it's steaming from just coming off the grill and it blew my mind. I had to go over and give the cook some kudos because it made all the difference. My wife (vegetarian) and mother in law also really love this place (Mo in law says it's the best chicken sandwich she's ever had). Truly great quality stuff with a great and cozy environment inside and river gate just looks nice as you look outside. Staff is always super friendly as well."}
{"text":"The only 4 words you need to know are: Spicy Pimento Cheese Sandwich

At the suggestion of a work buddy, we came here for sandwiches & salads & given her highest recommendation was the Pimento Cheese, who was I to argue?

This sandwich was phenomenal!!  Creamy cheese spread w/ little shreds of cheddar & red peppers ( aka, *pimentos* ) w/ a nice, spicy kick to the mix....all thickly schmeered on a Cranberry-Walnut-Wheat Bread & then grilled so it's all hot & gooey & toasty & melty!

This was out of this world!!!  So much so we all came back the next day for more!

And upon the next work trip, you'd better believe that sandwich will be on my list - I'm still drooling......"}
{"text":"I really like the options they have for sandwiches and wraps!   Artichokes and pestos and portobello wraps.  All very tasty.  Plus you can customize your smoothie with kale, chia, flax, or avo.  Very fresh!"}
{"text":"We were painting our house 3 weekends ago and decided to stop by Just Fresh for a lunch break.  

I got the California Dreamer wrap which is roast beef with an artichoke parmesean spread and the cucumber dill pasta salad.  Both were awesome!  I loved the wrap!  I'm not a fan of cucumbers, but I still liked the overall flavor of the pasta salad.

Kevin go the Bahama Mama wrap which is chicken with feta cheese and peppers.  It was also fabulous!  

I can't wait to try their other wraps as they have some great flavors to their wraps, and they are different than your usual sandwich shop.

There was no problem with service, order and wait for the food to arrive at your table.  Food came fast for them being busy."}
{"text":"Best lunch/dinner ever! The employees are so nice! Even the managers! I hate that the red pepper bisque is only seasonal, but the mushroom bree is worth ordering."}
{"text":"We just came in 45 minutes before closing on July 1. Spent $25 on two turkey burgers and sodas. We sat down, just in time for an employee to fire up the vacuum cleaner on our side of the building. She proceeded to vacuum under the table next to ours, then started vacuuming under our table and chairs while we were trying to eat!!! I kid you not. The vacuum was so loud we could not converse, and the vacuum-er seemed clueless when we asked her to stop. I spoke to the \"manager\" who looked all of 19 years old, and all he said was \"I'll tell her to stop\". No apologies, nothing. Unbelievable. 

P.S. The manager guy just locked the doors 15 minutes before their posted closing time."}
{"text":"Five stars because, and you've gotta try this, the Macchu Quinoa Bowl and the Caesar salad are five star wonderful. These are 2 separate menu items. These two are delicious and they make up for what is lacking at the rest of Just Fresh. Caesar salad is: Crisp romaine lettuce topped with parmesan and homemade croutons tossed with Caesar dressing. Macchu Quinoa Bowl is: All natural freshly roasted chicken, feta cheese, tomatoes, almonds and avocado over quinoa with white balsamic shallot vinaigrette.

Five stars because now you know what is excellent. And, here is what to avoid. Just Fresh also offers wraps and sandwiches. Neither category has anything that is above average. If you are going for wraps or sandwiches, keep going. This isn't the place for those.

Fast, friendly and open from 7AM til only 3 or 4 in the afternoon. So, heads up. Also, closed on weekends. (Boo)"}
{"text":"Can I say \"What the What\" Yes I've driven pass this place in Ballantyne, walked pass it in the airport and so forth and so on. Why Ooh why did I not try this place sooner? Well while waiting on my daughter to get out of acting class the hubby and I along with our little newborn were in search of lunch and I pulled up my handy dandy Yelp app and saw that this place was in the area so I said lets do it as I am in the mood for salad. 

The experience was very pleasant from start to finish. The cashier was friendly, interested and suggestive in our confusion of what to eat. I went with the Mandarin salad topped with grilled Chicken Breast and my husband had the chicken Caprese with sweet potato fries and we shared a strawberry banana smoothie. My salad was extremely tasty and my husband really enjoyed his sandwich. The smoothie was a little too sweet for my tastebuds as I like natural sweet from the fruits only and this smoothie was good but taste as if it was filled with added sweeteners which I am not fond of. 

We have deemed this our lunch spot when our daughter as acting school as we were very pleased. I just won't have the smoothie again."}
{"text":"Not impressed. \"Just Fresh\" served me a stale tortilla wrap. We were a little later than the regular lunch crowd, but there were still plenty of people around. I was surprised that, with them being reasonably busy, they would be serving stale food.

Otherwise it was reasonably nice. The restaurant was clean, the staff was friendly, and I usually like the Just Fresh food. They have tasty healthy options, but at those prices it really ought to be fresh."}
{"text":"Just Fresh was tasty I found out I like pimento cheese sandwiches from them.  It's fast no complaints it has a basic menu."}
{"text":"Oh My! I think Just Fresh got it right!

They are serving up fresh ingredients in tons of yummy salads, sandwiches and wraps at pretty reasonable prices! 

I stopped in for lunch on Saturday afternoon and it was pretty packed inside! I settled on the Little Red Rooster wrap which has chicken, ham, applewood smoked bacon, provolone, lettuce tomatoes and honey Dijon on a tomato basil tortilla. The combination of the meats with the honey Dijon was perfect! Everything pair so well together and the tortilla was so full of flavor robust flavor. It was like a party in my mouth...awesome! 

As a side, I tried the cucumber dill pasta salad, and this was another winner in my book! Great flavors with the seasonings they used and the dill added a very unique flavor! 

Overall, for the price and portion size, I'm keeping this place as one of my new favorites!"}
{"text":"The side cucumber pasta salad is tasty and refreshing, but the sandwiches I've tried so far have been pretty bland.  I love the sweet green tea from their dispensers though.  It's a nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"I was in the area for a professional development and decided to drop in. The staff were extremely helpful and pleasant...I mean REALLY NICE! The food was equally as good. They have outdoor seating and it's located in a mall-like atmosphere where you can shop as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Great selection on sandwiches and salads... Oh the Turkey Burger is dangerously good. The staff is nice and friendly. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Had the Godfather which was very good. Daughters kids pizza was solid. My wife liked her pimento sandwich. The pea salad was a good side despite being a little heavy on the onion. I will agree that the staff is a bit morose and detached but they were cordial overall. Prices were good and a decent healthy option which is rare in Charlotte.

The restaurant profile on yelp says beer and wine but this location did not have alcohol."}
{"text":"I am always served with a smile...even when I ask for a medium coffee (they only serve small and large...lol) the cashier normally corrects me and we laugh it off.    Just Fresh is also one of our \"go to\" locations for group orders for team/corporate events.  They are always organized and efficient when they deliver.  All of our orders are always fresh and tasty. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Everything tasted so fresh! It was light, but also satisfying! There are so many choices to choose from on the menu, so i'll be coming back to try them all. I really love their green tea and I definitely recommend getting that if you're looking for a refreshing drink. I got the cucumber and dill pasta salad and personally I think there was too much sauce, but that just depends on personal preference! It was still good. The staff was super friendly and the environment is clean."}
{"text":"Oh just fresh, how I used to love thee. 

I used to love this place since it was fresh and food came out delicious. But sadly, after several unsatisfactory meals, I must part ways. Dry tasteless sandwiches, overpriced salads with minimal toppings, and lackluster service was the tipping point. I am not sure what happened within the last year but they need to find mojo."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Great portion s for the price. Very fast service as well. This is my go to place for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Just Fresh as I feel they're just too overpriced for what you get, I mean over $7 for a salad that will leave you hungry an hour later?  Nope, can't do it, which is why I almost never eat here.  They offer mostly salads, sandwiches, soup, etc. They usually offer half off the salads, sandwiches, and cookies late afternoon on Friday's.  I do like that they have specialty smoothies for $2, and that is a pretty darn good deal and is usually the only reason I tend to stop in lately.  Hopefully they will keep this going throughout the summer."}
{"text":"The concept is good, it's kinda like Mcalisters but without the great sweet tea. 

Their green tea has a hint of mint.
The pasta salad is pretty decent. 
The veggie burger was ok,the avocado is fresh,so is the tomatoes and lettuce but the texture of the veggie burger is too spongy for me.  

Maybe I'll come back to try their salads."}
{"text":"I was not at all impressed with this place. Craving for a salad so I figure what better place to get one but Just Fresh! I wanted the blue, white and red salad with balsamic vinegar dressing, adding chicken for an extra $2.50! I also decided to add one boiled egg. Which they forgot to add to my order. I have left the business so no point of going back just for an boiled egg. The salad comes to $13(ish). 

Salad doesn't seem very fresh, chicken was meh. And I didn't care for the dressing.. 

Customer service was impersonal. Just there to service. Nothing special. To pay that much for a salad. Where I wasn't happy with and nothing about the customer service that would make me want to come back so I guess I won't!"}
{"text":"I love Just Fresh, I've been to different locations many times before, but in this one was my first time.
The stuff is very friendly, attentive and fast!
The food comes out pretty fast too.
The restaurant is clean and besides being very busy for lunch there were plenty of empty tables due to the size of the store.
I had a Blue Cobb salad that was really good and the amount of food was more than I was expecting.
If you are looking for health options this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Just fresh? What a contradictory name. I've been here twice and each time I have had the same disappointing experience. The food is usually over cooked and tasteless. I would expect a better meal for the price they charge."}
{"text":"I hadn't gone to this chain in awhile and needed breakfast so I ordered the sausage and cheddar wrap and then saw the price was $5.79??!! Are you freaking kidding me? Way too expensive for a basic small wrap. The cashier explained that it now comes with fruit. Honestly I don't care it's just way too much for a basic breakfast sandwich.  Obviously others must think so too because the place was dead. And their coffee sizes are either too small or too large...no medium. No coffee flavors to choose from like there used to be. No non-dairy creamer choices either. I predict this place won't stay in business unless they make some adjustments toward cheaper prices. Quality of the wrap wasn't as good as it used to be either. This side of town definitely needs more breakfast options."}
{"text":"Order lunch take out frequently.  It is always ready, hot & the lunch person is very courteous.  The order is always right.  No muss, no fuss, healthy & better than most places around that are fast food."}
{"text":"This Just Fresh location is in the bldg where I work making it ultra convenient to run down & grab a bite.  Orders are always fresh & accurate.  The owner & his staff are wonderful & generally know are able to ask if I'm having my usual.  I love the punch card & the double punch Mondays esp given I go every week day.  Service is quick, staff is friendly, location is really clean, & they are very accomodating to special orders.  The salads w/a roll are large enough that it is the perfect midday solution for a meal - healthy, great service, & in/out quickly no matter how long the line."}
{"text":"$3 for a Bad. Ass. breakfast platter and coffee.   The best way to start your day."}
{"text":"I like their red, white and blue salad with grilled chicken. They give you a side of French baguette, but I can't eat it so I wind up giving it away. Their bacon is good. So is the turkey sausage. I like their egg, cheese and bacon bowl. Makes for a very filling breakfast. They offer gluten free bread but I've never tried their sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food is barely fresh, but reasonably tasty. Good for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I tried Just Fresh for the first time today. I ordered a sausage, egg and cheese wrap. The lady took great care preparing it. It was still nice and hot when I went to eat it. It tasted great and filled me right up. Just Fresh is a great place to get a bite to eat. Watc h out though the drinks are expensive."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. My favorite is the huevos wrap. Always quick & reliable. Lunch is good too, but breakfast is my favorite!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab lunch while at work.  Food is really good and made fresh.  Staff is super friendly.  One time I had been waiting a little longer than normal (not long enough for me to really notice) and the manager asked what I ordered and went looking for it.  When he couldn't find the ticket he credited me back for that lunch and gave me a free lunch for next time.  I love unexpected amazing customer service.  It will always change a good place into a great place!!!
I have been to the other locations in uptown as well and this is by far the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, friendly staff, great atmosphere! The food is delicious and not greasy at all. It stands to its name and tastes fresh! I would recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"Glad to find decent food while I'm traveling for work.  Mac n cheese was really cheesy...if you like it super cheesy.  Mandarin salad was good...wish there was more lettuce than was given."}
{"text":"A definite go to spot when I'm in the area! Tasty ingredients, friendly customer service. They even recently updated their menu for even more options. 
One of the best options in the area for \"fast food\", whether you take it to go, or sit in the dining area. I enjoy having this option around, so I don't have to stop for your normal fast food!"}
{"text":"I ordered the tuna melt which was soooo good! And I had the sweet potato fries which were crunchy( NOT soggy). The coffee however was nasty. But the food made up for it! Also it's not even expensive for quality food!(:"}
{"text":"It was the worst dining experience I've had in a while. My bacon was burnt . The sausage was bland. The hash browns were dry and tasted like they were left over from last Sunday. I will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"The food at Just Fresh is simply amazing.  I have tried sandwiches, wraps, salads, soups ... you name it.  Everything is splendid.  

The prices are a bit steeper than a standard fast food joint, so if you're expecting an upscale Subway, then just move along.  This is a lifestyle restaurant that isn't selling the cheapest lose weight item, but the best and freshest food you'll find.  

I can't say enough.  Food Good ... Eat Here"}
{"text":"My blue cobb salad was good, and pretty healthy to boot. The nutritional info is easy to find and they have full breakdowns of everything which is good for anyone trying to be conscious of what they're eating."}
{"text":"Just fresh is just freakin amazing.   Everything on the freakin menu is freakin delicious.   From the salads to the sandwiches to the burgers."}
{"text":"Awesome, friendly service, great pricing, healthy food ... Eat lunch without feeling sluggish... Their salads rock... It's a great little local lunch spot (:"}
{"text":"This was absolutely delicious! It was suggested to me by Books a Million. I was wasting time waiting for my children to enjoy a day at Carowinds. I had a salad and a smoothie, and read my book for a few hours. The hostess was precious and frequently asked if she could get me ice water or lemons. I would absolutely go back. Hopefully , this chain makes it's way south to Columbia or Lexington, SC."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. I am an avid Juicer/Smoothie drinker. I would not vouch for their smoothies. They claim to be fresh but are not fresh at all. However, their Mediterranean chicken sandwich is really good with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"The people are fantastic, the food not so much.  Just spent $10 bucks on a ham and cheese sandwich and the bread was at a minimum 3 days old.  The least they can do is ensure the quality of their food, specially when they have so much competition around.  Sorry guys, you earned this one for falling short on standards."}
{"text":"Very great and healthy options.  Service is great!  The sandwiches are really good especially the turkey burger very rich in flavor and the bun is delicious.  So glad it's in rivergate now another dining spot to enjoy."}
{"text":"Saturday noontime, I stopped in for brunch while I waiting on my dog grooming at Petsmart next door. The restaurant was mildly busy though plenty of well spaced tables were available. Smaller 4 tops as well as a 6 and a round table, plus a long \"family-style\" table in the center. Lots of good space and windows on three sides of the restaurant - a great location, well designed to be welcoming.

On the weekend, they have a brunch menu until 2:00 PM plus their regular sandwich, burger and salad menu. They also offer an eclectic selection of domestic and imported beers, as well as wine. Today seemed like an Eggs Benedict day, so I ordered that with coffee. I was given a number to display at my table and went off to prepare my coffee. A regular and a decaf urn were available with creamer and the usual selection of sweetener products. There is also a soda fountain with Coke products and urns of sweet and unsweet tea.

The eggs were brought to my table a few minutes later. Fresh, hot and looking delicious. Two perfectly poached eggs and sliced ham on ciabatta with a good amount of hollandaise sauce, sliced melon and chicken sausage patties (bacon is also available). I found it heavenly and a good portion for $8.99.

After finishing my meal, I hung around the restaurant for a while. There is plenty of reading material - newspapers abound and two large screen TV's were tuned in to ESPN and the Food channel. The free wi-fi was easy to connect to and was speedy. Because it was raining, I stayed inside, but they have a dozen tables outside that would be really nice on a sunny day.

Good food, good location, good prices. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Do not eat here with kids! We were asked to \"clean up our mess\"  of our 2 18 month olds...is this how you treat parents? The manager said several complaints were made by other guests...is this good customer service? With all the choices and a redundant menu like this...look around especially if you have kids! The food is ok, again there are several choices!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here the other day. Super good! Wish the fruit side was something other than melons, I would love to have had strawberries or something"}
{"text":"waitress was very rude after i took the wrong smoothie even though we paid for it and it was my dads but whatever i'm fine and i took the green one bc i thought it was strawberry banana but it wasn't and she rudely asked \"have you ever seen green strawberries\" in the most sarcastic way and little does she know on my mission trip to zimbabwe the children only ate green strawberries so don't judge unless you know the whole story."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this Just Fresh for about four years and just realized that I've never written a review. I usually stop at JF for lunch or dinner. They have lots of choice on the menu and I can always find something good. They recently raised their prices, but they still provide good value for the price. Tables are clean and it's a good atmosphere. They also provide a punch card that gets to a free sandwich with the purchase of 10 sandwiches.  Mondays are \"double punch\" days, so you get two punches for each meal you purchase."}
{"text":"After a few follow up visits I have to adjust my Just Fresh review. First point - the prices have been raised. Not the end of the world but I would have expected better food / service after prices were raised instead of it going downhill.

The last couple of visits have been spotty with items being left off when the food is brought out. Some of the staff are friendly but many are not. On our last visit I was finishing up my plate when the waitress came to clear my boyfriend's empty plate. She asked if he was finished and since he was in the middle of a conversation with me had to turn and ask her what she said. She mumbled, rolled her eyes and with a sigh said \"nevermind\" while she grabbed his plate and walked off. I found her attitude pretty rude and we will probably not return."}
{"text":"This place as gone way down hill with service. I use to tell everyone how great it is, and if you haven't been in a bout 6 months.. Don't go, just hold on to that memory of a great place. No one there seems to give a hoot about the customers. one of many examples- I phoned my order in, i drove up there (knowing it would be ready).. i paid the cashier, watched her walk over and grab my food... and then she just started chatting with a cook, for several minutes i watch as she held my togo box SIDEWAYS.. i finally walked over and just asked for it, and she handed it over..sideways and all... and this as been the norm now, just a total lack of care about the customer experience. 
Another time i placed a Togo order, i paid, she said it wasn't ready... 15 minutes later she grabs a box that has been sitting on the counter since before i got there and hands it to me."}
{"text":"I have found this establishment to be efficient and effective. When I'm running between appointments and don't have a lot of time for a leisurely lunch, Just Fresh comes through! The employees here are friendly and efficient and when I first visited and didn't understand the routine/process they kindly explained it. The food is good and there's a nice variety of options, including some quick take items. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"i have eaten here a couple times and i don't think i was unhappy about anything other than their prices. Its kind of expensive to me but it taste good. They have one of the best turkey burgers I've had in a long time and their banana pudding is pretty tasty. The food is made to order and their cashiers are very friendly. Its nice and clean, plus its located in a nice shopping mall."}
{"text":"If you're struggling to find a lunch spot during your one hour break and you keep circling around between eating something healthy or down right bad for you like chik fil a, AND it's Monday, go to just fresh! Get their loyalty card bc it's double punch Monday's which means when you go there 5 mondays, you can get a free meal up to $7.99! Oh yeah.... Winning!!!

Although their food is pretty basic, their Cajun chicken salad is decent and somewhat flavorful. And I heard the mandarin salad is tasty too."}
{"text":"I like to wander aimlessly for my lunch break and pretend I'm just exploring the city and not just on an hour hiatus from work. One day my wandering let me into the doors of the Ivey Building and the smells of \"Just Fresh\" pulled me in. 

There are so many things I want to try, but OMG, I seriously can't get past the Chicken Caprese sandwich. It tastes like amazingness wrapped into a sandwichy goodness. Seriously. NOM. I get that and the pasta salad, and I tell myself all the time, \"Ok, today is the day I'm going to get in there and try something new..today is the daa....oh my god I can't resisttttt Chicken Caprese. The words come out of my mouth before my brain has time to react and it's a huge nom fest from there. 

The staff is always awsome and they have specials at times during the week too. I got free pasta salad with my sandwich yesterday so I was pretty excited. It may not be the healthiest option as the names suggests, but when I eat I'm all about flavor. Just Fresh has it and I'm a huge fan. 

I mean I'm not gonna go outside it's doors and scream like a deranged roadie or anything, but I'm close. Oh Just Fresh, you make my lunch time adventure awesome :)"}
{"text":"Welcome to high priced mediocre food!  Foods not horrible just mediocre for the high prices they charge.  Never again...Breakfast for two (two wraps, pancakes, and OJ for $32). If this were exceptionally good food I would not mind the exhorbinant price."}
{"text":"HUGE update - came here at 2pm for a late lunch on Thursday. Not a customer in sight but you know what it was friggin good. I got the Caesar Salad and that baby was mad fresh. I gots only good things to say about it. Also, the staff was friendly too. Nice.

dmo out"}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying their menu style is somewhat similar to Panera bread, McAlister's deli and etc. The biggest difference is they offer grilled items like a burger or chicken sammie. Me personally, i like them best compared to McAlister's or panera. The food and service is always on point here. Check them out if you haven't already given them a chance."}
{"text":"I go to this place every now and then because its convenient and I think thats the only reason they're still in business.  Wish it was easier to find some decent oatmeal for breakfast.  \"Just fresh\" is a good way for them to appear like they have quality food, but, they don't.  Always disappointed, never pleasantly surprised by the food I get here...done with it...despite the convenience."}
{"text":"Great food - wonderful service - Annette is the best server around and always has a smile w kind words !!!!"}
{"text":"For a chain sandwich shop this place is amazing. Eat there most every day I don't bring my lunch. Fast, friendly - super staff, excellent customer service - and the food is good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots uptown Charlotte!  My usual is a tuna salad sandwich on sourdough wit lettuce cucumber tomato and pepper jack cheese.  Along with a cup of vegetable soup, this lunch is sure to please. Some of my other favorite menu items is the fresh start wrap, croissants, and California dreamer wrap.  Their Mac and cheese is pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"Not a good start. No greeting, no smiles. You order at counter with the unknowledgeable,unfriendly kid. Looks at me like I have five heads when I ask if an English muffin comes with breakfast. I ordered the breakfast platter. This breakfast quickly went from $7.89 to almost 13 dollars with the addition of a small coffee and an English muffin that I never got and when I asked for it a second time toasted dark, it came back light and I sent it back.  The place isn't even crowded. This is what happens when you stupidly have kids run the show. I had to go ask where my English muffin was and it was sitting on the side. My breakfast is now ice cold. I was gonna leave it and get my money back, but I was hungry. Ok, back to the food. Typical bacon, eggs, sausage, and potatoes. . Ah, the potatoes. Salty little crispy nuggets of potatoes. Perfectly seasoned. My honey wheat English muffin was good too. They give a ton of eggs, a little dry tho. I  hafta say the coffee is delicious. Actually, one of the best coffees I've had so far. Everyone has pisswater for coffee, not this place. It's rich and mellow, not harsh, weak, or bitter. Ah, but alas, I won't be going back. The service, attitude, and lack of knowledge these millennial morons possess isn't worth it. Just Fresh? Better name would be Just Not Worth it."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great ingredients and healthy options is a recipe for success. Had just a turkey burger, which was AMAZING!!! The restaurant is clean, fairly quick (although if you are on a lunch break, I would call in your order) and staff is very nice.. The Turkey burger is my favorite and its a thick, juicy patty on a nice soft bun. Yum!   One of the staff knew I liked my ketchup with red wine vinegar in it.  She had picked some up and stored it in the back. Next time I came in, she gave me some."}
{"text":"Looking to go out but stay healthy? This place has very healthy food and good for you. The sweet potato fries are really good and so is the Turkey burgers too. I have been coming here for a few years now and would suggest it to anyone who wants to be health."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed going to Just Fresh.  They have a decently large menu for most people to find something.  It does get a little busy during lunch but the staff has been on top of it and extremely apologetic if something doesn't come out right and they make it right.  It's quieter for breakfast if you want to just stop in though.  

It's a good \"go to\" place for lunch that will please most people with fresh (hot and cold) options!"}
{"text":"Okay food. Ordered to go. 20 minutes on a drink. Ended up eating there. Defeated the to go purpose."}
{"text":"Normally, I have good salads from there, however, today the Mozzobella did not add up.  For $6.71, I had 2 portabella mushrooms and 4 small pieces of mozzarella and a ton of salad.  Just not an even distribution of items.  They must do better."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get a sandwich of some sort. I've tried several of them and have yet to get a bad one! The service is always perfect and the staff is always friendly and more than willing to offer suggestions! They have brunch as well on Sunday's! I recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"The food here is consistent, and servers are friendly. More often than not, food comes out super quick. Turkey burger is incredible! Unsweetened green tea is my favorite beverage...especially with free refills! We come here often for lunch on work days, and there's something for everyone. Another favorite of the group is the quesadilla. The also deliver if you are nearby and have a large enough order. We use them a lot for smaller lunch meetings. They have enclosed the outdoor seating, so you can be outside even when the weather is bad. They open it up on nice days, so it makes a nice escape from the stuffy office on a Friday afternoon."}
{"text":"Nice staff, nice environment. A little noisy, but they also have outdoor seating which is nice. The food it great, there are a lot of options and a wide variety of healthy foods. You can go in with a group and there is something for everyone on the menu."}
{"text":"Food tasted good, line was not long and service was quick. Food was a little plain and a little pricey for what you're getting, but a good place for a quick to go lunch."}
{"text":"I have a Just Fresh under a mile from my house and I've never gone, but somehow I end up eating at this one.. Overall I'd say its definitely three star material. 

Minimal service (which is how it was designed), edible food, decent prices, clean tables. I had one of the chicken sandwiches and it was alright, nothing amazing. I was full after but I wasn't really satisfied. There were a few things I would have tried if I hadn't given cheese up for Lent, but I'm guessing they all are about the same, mediocre crowd pleaser. 

I bet there are one or two awesome items on that menu, and in a pinch I could make my way back to one, but I think I can find better lunch."}
{"text":"As with my feelings toward other Just Fresh locations, this Just Fresh location is just okay.  Due to the fact I work uptown and this is located near me it is an easy stop.  Just Fresh offers a wide variety of prepared sandwiches, salads, etc. so you can grab and go. In addition, you can order something Fresh at the counter. Although you can order something fresh, I just don't find anything great.  The soups are always ok, somewhat bland in my mind.  However, the sandwiches are my go to selection, since you can make your own at the counter.
There are a limited number of seats at a counter and two small tables, so know this is really a grab and go location, unlike their other locations.
I will say service is always spot on...a definite friendly staff at this location.

Overall, Just Fresh is not my go to spot, but it does the job when I am looking from something different."}
{"text":"Having recently relocating to the downtown area, this Just Fresh location is new to me. The staff is so friendly, one of the best I have seen in downtown. They accommodated my request for an extra side of sauce, for my sandwich, and allowed me to taste two soups, because I was undecided. Needless to say, I enjoyed a mini Ham & Swiss, heated to perfection which melted the cheese, and a cup of broccoli cheese soup. I had the soup at another Just Fresh location, but this location was better! Overall, I will definitely be back.
Reason I didn't give them a 5, the bread was a little hard(stale)??. Luckily I dipped it in the soup."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about three times and the times beforehand I was like \"the food is decent\", but I must wasn't ordering the right thing b/c this last time is what earned them 4 stars.  

I ordered a Bahama Mama Chicken Wrap with Sweet Pea Salad (see attached pictures that I uploaded for your viewing pleasure)...good!  The Bahama Mama Chicken Wrap wasn't what I expected when i first bite in b/c the chicken was finely chopped like a chicken salad.  The sauce was spicy sweet and the peppers and feta cheese complimented it very well.  This was my first time ever eating Sweet Pea Salad and the cashier gave an accurate description of it when I asked what it was.  Basically, it's sweet peas, shredded cheese, and a mayo mixture.  I know...doesn't sound too good does it, and it didn't sound that great to me also but I'm the type of person who will try something and if I don't like it then I won't get it anymore.  This time was different (don't judge a book by its cover) b/c this stuff was good.  So good that I signed on to Pinterest and pinned a few Sweet Pea Salad recipes.

The staff is friendly and if it's your first time then they usually can you help you out with a few of their personal suggestions.  You should try this place if you're in the Steele Creek area...they usually have daily deals and once you're finished you can go shopping since its in a nice shopping center with plenty of choices :)"}
{"text":"It has has been a while since I have visited this location. I am not sure how many others are still in the area but it was a great, quick choice for me. I purchased the pre-nade Dijon Dill Chicken Salad Plate. It came with greens and tomatoes, bread chips, and fruit. The bread chips were a bit salty for me but the salad was great. They have carried options for lunch with something for everyone."}
{"text":"If you want  quick,simple,and healthy options to eat for lunch this is the place to be. Im a fan of artichoke spread thanks to just fresh. A few of their wraps and sandwhiches has their fresh artichoke spread on them. The wraps and sandwhiches comes with a choice of a side which i chose the fresh fruit salad cup for my side first time trying the florintine which has the zesty artichoke parmesan spread  wrapped in fresh roasted chicken breast with organic baby spinach, tomatoes,swiss cheese, and its wrapped in a spinach herb tortilla, how can i forget about the the berry berry blast smoothie i had with my meal to wash it all down it was tasty  only thing i would change is i really thought my smoothie was going to come out in a plastic clear cup like most smoothies are in when you visit a smoothie or juice shop."}
