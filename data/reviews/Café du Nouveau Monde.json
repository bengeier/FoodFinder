{"text":"Toujours un plaisir de fréquenter le café du Nouveau Monde avant un spectacle à la Place des Arts. Le menu est varié et les plats offerts sont délicieux !"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this while walking around downtown and loved it. Excellent seafoods and service. We had the scallops and salmon.  It is located in the arts district on the pedestrian walk way.  Service was good and English is spoken."}

{"text":"Wandering the streets of Montreal while on Spring Break with a friend, we stumbled across the restaurant and decided to have dinner here after seeing the menu and other great reviews.   I had the grilled hanger steak with a bourbon crème brûlée for dessert while she had a duck confit and apple and pear spiced pie with salted caramel and vanilla ice cream for dessert. We both agreed that the quality of the meal was amazing, especially for the price we paid. For my own meal the steak was cooked exactly how I liked it, and the spices went with the steak perfectly. The crème brûlée was also delicious and you could really taste the cream in there.  The service was excellent and the restaurant generally had a warm atmosphere. We were worried about not having seats as it looked rather full and we did not have reservations, but we were instantly seated. The waiters checked up on us several times during the meal and were very friendly, even asking if we were watching the show at the theatre in the same building to see if we were in a rush. The food came very fast and we were served at the same time. No need to worry about speaking in French either as the waiters were all very fluent in English.   Overall the restaurant was amazing and I would definitely recommend it for everyone taking a trip to Montreal! No complaints."}
{"text":"After visiting the Leonard Cohen exhibition, we had a nice lunch here. The food is yummy, and staff are very nice and helpful. We would like to come back and try the dinner in future."}
{"text":"We walked in here on a cold wintery evening after not being enticed by anything else in the area with high expectations based on Yelp reviews but left pretty underwhelmed.  The ambiance is cozy and warm and we were seated on the second floor upon arrival near the windows. As soon as we sat, menus were placed on our table but it felt like forever before we were spoken to or given any attention. A close look at the menu showed us limited options - so limited in fact that I almost couldn't find anything to eat but that could've just been my mood so don't take this part too seriously :)   We ended up ordering a bowl of chips to share (nothing special..tasted like Kettle chips) and I ordered the beef salad while hubby ordered the duck confit. Both our dishes were amazing but the duck plate left hubby hungry so it wasn't too filling. Service was quick but verrryyyy impersonal and borderline robotic. Overall, we were pretty meh about the whole experience, so we decided to forego dessert and pop into Chocolats Favoris for dipped ice cream instead. Although the food was good, neither one of us felt drawn to Cafe du Nouveau Monde unfortunately....won't be back!"}
{"text":"Je cherchais un lieu pour souper tard et suis tombée sur ce restaurant très bien situé dans le quartier des spectacles. Les plats étaient très bien présentés et raffinés. J'ai goûté une salade de chèvre chaud sur un cracker fait aux noix et également un carpaccio de buf. Tout était parfait et le service très professionnel. J'y retournerai sans hésiter après un spectacle par exemple."}
{"text":"Parfait pour manger un bon diner sur une terasse au soleil !   J'ai mangé en entré de la truite fumé et c'etait divin ! Le tartare de beouf etait très bon aussi. La viande etait un peu trop haché mais le gout etait excellent !  Je vous suggere fortement de manger a cette endroit avant un show au TNM ! Vous ne serez pas dessus !"}
{"text":"Despite it being busy on a weeknight and not having a reservation, we were seated with minimal waiting time.   The service was great, and the food was too. It also arrived rather quickly which is always appreciated.  The menu is nice and varied, but not uninspiringly so. A few dishes in every category from meats and seafood to pasta to sandwiches, with what seemed like many interesting options.  I had the mussel and scallop risotto and it was fantastic!! The portion wasn't very large, so don't expect to be full from just that, but considering how delicious it was, the price, and the location, the portion was fair. The creme brulee was also delightful.  Definitely worth dropping in for a meal before or after seeing any shows in the area!"}
{"text":"Family and I passed by here after dinner for some more drinks. We had a couple youngins with us so we couldn't exactly go to a bar. Decided to try Café Du Nouveau Monde and it was pretty great. Lots of drinks on the menu and plenty of beers on tap. I was also able to steal some bites of the crème brûlée which was amazing."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Montreal with a group of friends, I was searching the web and Yelp for a good place to eat close to my hotel that was not Asian and I happened upon Café du Nouveau Monde.  When I saw that one of their featured cocktails was my favorite Negroni, my decision was made toute suite.  Seeing that the café is in the same building as the Théâtre du Nouveau Monde and that I arrived about 20 minutes before curtain, I was very pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately, albeit at a smallish table for two, but just right for a single diner.  The café was in high gear with theatre-goers, but my server attended to my desire for a Negroni as soon as I had the menu in my hand.  The drink was delivered in no time flat, and my oh my, it was as good as if I had made it myself.  I shared that information with my server while ordering my meal, and was paid a visit by the bartender shortly thereafter for a nice conversation about proper balance and craft cocktails in general.  A very nice and knowledgable lady.  When I ordered a second one, it was just as perfectly made as the first.  My food was exceptionally good from entree (sauteed mushrooms on crostini) to main (grilled pork chop, a special) to dessert (affogato, served properly with grappa and a shot of espresso on the side).  The café pretty much cleared out at curtain time, but it wasn't long before more people showed up to keep the place lively.  And while I did have a main server, others on the friendly and attractive wait staff had no problem checking in on me and I certainly enjoyed practicing my conversational French with them.  I returned twice during my week in Montreal, once for lunch with a couple of friends (warm octopus salad for me, very good) and for another single dinner (sauteed shrimp entree, roasted scallop main and white chocolate cheese cake dessert, all delicious) later the same day.  And yes, more Negronis at dinner, each as good as the very first.  I would have loved to return to Cafe du Nouveau Monde again, but it being my last night in Montreal, it was made memorable by the food, the Negronis, the great bartender and wait staff.  À la prochaine, Cafe du Nouveau Monde!"}
{"text":"-Excusez-moi, nous allons voir un spectacle à la Place des Arts à 20 h  Il est 19 h lorsque nous avons pris place au Café du Nouveau Monde, un établissement que nous fréquentions lorsque nous étions abonnés au Théâtre du Nouveau Monde. C'est donc pour nous un \"retour aux sources\" après quelques années !   Je ne vous parlerai pas trop du tartare de saumon -excellent, soit dit en passant- et de mon vin de Toscane, ni de l'espresso et du fabuleux dessert que j'ai partagé avec mon épouse. Je veux plutôt souligner le travail du personnel, soit les serveurs, serveuses, cuisiniers et cuisinières, aide-serveurs, etc.   En plein soir de spectacle, ils travaillent comme des fourmis, gardent leur sourire malgré les exigences répétés de deux ou trois clients, apportent votre plat dans un temps raisonnable, s'assurent que vous passez une bonne soirée.   Donc très bons services, des plats appétissants."}
{"text":"Superb setting. Tasty and classy food. Noisy but that's what one expects in such a lively place. Service is quick and efficient. Had the beef tartare which was excellent. Cocktails are also nicely prepared."}
{"text":"We had a reservation and were on time but had to wait 20 minutes before getting seated.  My plate was cold.  When told, the waitress took it back and brought it back...even colder.  We had a show to get to and advised them before starting. They said it wouldn't be a problem, that they were used to.  We had to leave before dessert and coffee, with our finished but not-so-empty main dishes still on the table, after reminding them we were in a rush...multiple times."}
{"text":"We arrived in Montreal and settled into our motel before heading out in the COLD rain to find a place to eat. We were actually looking for a recommended restaurant and happened upon this jewel so we ducked in to get out of the rain. The service was slow but steady. We were never ignored but it wasn't as speedy and we like. We had a good wine (beer for him) and ordered a salad and a cheese plate. The restaurant is cozy and full of nooks and crannies, and interesting seating configurations. We were seated next to a window and enjoyed watching people scurrying about with their mackinacks and umbrellas in the downpour. Because the US dollar was so strong, when our credit card statement came in we were delighted to see that the conversion rate was quite favorable.  The menu was in French but we were also given an English version which was fun...I practiced my high school French comprehension and then had my husband check my translation...and I was correct more than I was wrong! All in all, it was a nice, relaxing time spent here, unwinding after the travails of customs, buying transportation vouchers, finding our way to our hotel, unpacking, and then heading out in a totally new city to try to find sustenance. If we ever return to Montreal, we'll definitely return to Cafe du Nouveau Monde!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever given a place 5 stars but the location, atmosphere and food were perfect for our sunny day trip to Montreal. We were quickly seated as requested outside in the shade. The water was delicious and the staff quite friendly and punctual. I ordered a bacon cheese burger which was accompanied by a delicious salad. The burger itself was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Something many places have trouble doing. It was one of those meals that leaves you satisfied but not full. Definitely worth a return trip"}
{"text":"Believe the reviews and make sure you order two pieces of almond cake so you can share with your friends.   I had the caprese salad and the charcuterie. The salad was great and the meats were a nice finish to my meal.   I ruthlessly raided the scallops from my girlfriends plate when she wasn't looking. They were amazing.   Then the woman across from me went to the bathroom. I easily ate a solid chunk of the Angus beef salad before she got back. It was amazing as well.   I tried to sneak some of Lenny scallops. Lenny gets violent when you try and take his food. Lenny's ability to defend his plate from my fork was also amazing.   The staff made it fun and kept us well lubricated. We had dessert, and well you can see from the picture that we shared.  The alcohol helped that picture happen."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Presentation of meals is 10/10. Great prices and worth the visit! Servers have great French and English language, does a great job with any translation needed."}
