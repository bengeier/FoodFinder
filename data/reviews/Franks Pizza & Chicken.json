{"text":"Excellent food, the wings are by far the best I've ever had.  Warning, very addictive!!! (:"}
{"text":"I used to order on a consistent basis pizza, chicken, various appetizers and the pepperoni roll spending well over $50 on each order.  The last few  times I ordered it took an hour to get my food. On top of that my orders were not correct.  It's one thing to have to wait a long time but to also mess up a simple order is not acceptable. Management needs to check on who is managing the shop when they are not around.  This is costing them money at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best. .  a bit hectic but it adds to a true italian atmosphere.. Great product and price"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered from here last weekend.  We got a buffalo chicken pizza and chicken bacon ranch pizza.  We were both extremely happy with the quality of the food.  We called ahead and the food was ready when I walked in to pick it up.  The staff was nice, about what you would expect at a little local pizza place.  The pizza is worth going back for."}
{"text":"Wanted to stay in for the night and wanted some delivery. I ordered the potato pancake bites an eight cut buffalo chicken pizza and an italian sub. The man who took the order even repeated the order back to me and asked if I wanted a half or whole italian sub.I said a whole italian sub. We waited for an hour when we were quoted foe 20minutes. Finally the delivery man came. I was charged a 6$ delivery fee,and there was no italian sub. I was pretty disappointed with Frank's pizza after this .I just don't understand how they missed the sub when it was repeated back to me. After all of the waiting I still wasn't impressed with the food or customer service. won't order from.them anytime soon. Very disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Best in the Millvale area so far. Always fresh ingredients and dough.  The wings are great, not soggy or microwaved. Try the square cut pizza,  it's awesome."}
{"text":"I just had the Sicilian Pizza with onions, green peppers, and tomatoes, and it was delicious. Their crust is one of the best I've ever had. It is airy and has a crispness that is to me, addictive. I could just eat the crust and be happy. 
I ordered from Millvale, not sure of the other locations as far as consistency, but I can't see why it would be any different. 
I order from this place every time I dog sit for a friend here in Millvale."}
{"text":"As an ex employee i can say the food is pretty descent.  Not the greatest but its ok.  A little over priced.  But the employees that work there are terrible.  I couldnt deal with the high school drama there.  And the sad part is that everybody that works there is already out of high school.  The manager,  who im not going to say HER name is a two faced, conniving woman.  I wanted to say another word but i thought i would just keep this professional.  The amount of talking behind your back that you have to deal with from her is not worth the lack luster pay that you get.  You know its bad when her own sister, who also works there, doesnt like her.  I will never recommend this place as long as that witch works there."}
{"text":"We just picked up a pizza and wings from Frank's, we had a coupon for 50% off. I said I'll take the 12 cut. The girl taking the order said it's square. Okay it probably tastes the same right ?  A photo of our \"square\" pizza, to be fair it did have 12 cuts. It was cold, overpriced and way below average."}
{"text":"BEST buffalo chicken pizza I have had anywhere, hands down! We have gotten the Buffalo Chicken Pizza for friends when they have come into town, and they ask for it every time they return to the Burg! Have not tried anything else on the menu because the Buffalo Chicken Pizza is that good!"}
{"text":"The wings were awesome. The pizza was good too, not as good as the wings, but still very good. Overall would definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Ordered a.medium pizza only to sit and wait for close to an hour before they realized they never put our order in.  10 minutes later they tried giving us a small pizza as opposed to what we paid for.  My wife had to pretty much tell them that we sat and waiting for our food and the very least they could do was refund our $.  Would have given 2 stars because the staff was sorry, but the pizza was along the lines of a chuck e cheese or Dominos pizza"}
{"text":"Finally got around to ordering from Frank's, considering I pass it twice a day going to/from work. I typically don't order specialty pizzas, but decided to try their buffalo chicken pizza and \"broasted\" wings.

The pizza was fantastic, the right amount of cheese, a crisp dough, and plump pieces of buffalo chicken. It's a little dry which is OK as dipping in their homemade ranch is a must. 

The broasted chicken is interesting as it's supposedly a healthier option. Wonderfully juicy meat with a crisp breading. Could use a little more spice or seasoning but it stands alone pretty well.

Had a lunch delivered for less than $10, which is also great considering they don't charge a delivery fee and had the food to me in about 30 minutes. Will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"Franks Pizza and Chicken is a resturant that a co-worker of mine introduced me too.  Its one of those hidden gems no doubt.  

Best Buffalo Chicken Pizza I have ever had. If you don't live close its worth the drive. The ranch that accompanies the pizza is amazing.  

The resturant carries pizza, salads, calazones, and plenty of chicken varities.. such as roasted chicken, tenders, bites etc. 

The appetizer selections:   mac and cheese bites, potato pancake bites etc. 

There are several locations.. I have only visited the North Hills location."}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken pizza is incredible. Fast service and nice people behind the counter."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken pizza is our favorite from this local pizza shop. It's the perfect mix of chicken and sauce. It's not too spicy which I like. The homemade ranch dressing that is served with the pizza is delicious and a \"must have\"! The delivery time is usually longer than most pizza places, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We had heard from a couple of friends that the Pepperoni & steak Pizza Rolls were great. So my wife and I stopped down today and ordered one. Keep in mind that I  LOVE garlic and have never complained about any food having too much garlic in it. Well, I have to say that the garlic taste overwhelmed everything else in the Pizza roll. I can't speak about the other foods that they make, but I will never order this again. Makes me wonder if their other foods have too much Garlic in them. Don't think that we will be back again."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite pizza place. The pizza is always hot and the driver is always prompt and friendly. Their pepperoni is AMAZING! I love the prices of the two liters of soda they offer. They also have Gatorade! Talk about convenience!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 8 cut Sicilian pizza and 12 honey barbecue wings last evening from the Franks on Mt Royal Blvd.  The pizza was burnt and the crust was rock hard.  Also, it was just thrown in the box and the appearance was terrible.  My 19 year old nephew could not believe it as he asked me what it was.  There was hardly any sauce on the wings. You definitely could not taste honey barbecue.  And the delivery man was trying to walk in my entry way and was talking to my nephews (19 months and 9 years old).  That was really creepy!"}
{"text":"We order franks multiple times each week. Their buffalo chicken pizza is out of this world. They have timely delivery divers and great weekday specials. Nothing on the menu has ever let us down."}
{"text":"Had a problem with the bill, very happy with managers correction! Got Pizza and wings. Pizza was very good. Like the amount of cheese. Not a fan of the wings. They were soggy. Not sure if it's the \"special\" way they make them or just the batch I got. Other reviews said they had wings that were crispy. Not mine. Flavor was great."}
{"text":"Best buffalo chicken pizza I have ever had in my entire life. Also the best and only ranch I use. Couldn't live without this place"}
{"text":"Been ordering for years, however today they took an hour and 35 minutes to get here. Never called to say they were running late and guy finally showed up while my husband was on the phone on the manager. Never again. It would probably be cold so we aren't ordering from them again. We are only 5 minutes away so doesn't make any sense. 35 mins on a Wednesday is ridiculous. Not a game day, nothing. Get it together Franks. Lost a 10 year customer today. Stupid."}
{"text":"What happened to Mount Royal location? Pizza was always good til this last time. It was over cooked CRAP! I NOTICE  a new oven or what looks like a huge silver box with a window. possibly a conveyer belt ! Anyone have an idea of whats up with this. We will no longer go here as to many young and unprofessional, inexperienced  and clue less working here."}
{"text":"Best buffalo chicken pizza and bread bites I've ever had. Love how they put tons of butter garlic and Parmesan on the bites. I'm addicted to them!!!"}
{"text":"Always love everything. Breadsticks are the best around. I've heard great things about the buffalo chicken pizza but I'm a vegetarian so haven't tried it personally. Tip- get it delivered if you don't like to parallel park. No inside seating but they have some tables outside"}
{"text":"Frank's!!!  Love their pizza and their wings!!!  Fast and tastes so yummy.  No frills place that is worth it in Etna"}
{"text":"The Franks Pizza & Chicken chain is great!  We love their Buffalo Chicken Pizza and Broasted Chicken.  Since they opened the Ross location we have probably been there a dozen times and have never been dissapointed with the quality of the food or service.  We even had catering from them for my husbands birthday picnic and the manager hooked us up on the price since we were ordering a large order.  They carry Pepsi products so you can get Mountain Dew there.  

All in all this is a pretty good place to get dinner.  I have always picked up since we live pretty close so can't comment on delivery.

Only downside of this location is you can only eat there in good weather since seating is outside."}
{"text":"I am a huge pizza connoisseur,and  Frank's is definitely up there as some of the best pizza in Pittsburgh. If you're in the mood for a cheese or pepperoni pizza, I wouldn't recommend Frank's. It's fine pizza, but it's nothing like a slice from Benny Fiero's or Mineo's.

 BUT, if you like Buffalo Chicken Pizza, this is the PLACE TO BE. It's absolutely the best Buffalo Chicken Pizza in town. The homemade ranch sauce that they give you is out of this world good too. The pizza isn't very saucy and runny like some other BC pizza that I've had around the area. A must try for BC lovers."}
{"text":"I have not had anything other than the Buffalo chicken pizza.  That is what Franks is kind of known for and this alone is enough to warrant five stars.

Franks has without a doubt the best buffalo chicken pizza I have ever had.  I am a huge Buffalo chicken fan, and some places fall short when they try to put it onto a pizza. But Franks has it down perfect.  The crust is flavorful, but not overpowering.  The Buffalo sauce is a perfect degree of heat and taste.  The cheese compliments the other flavors.  Finally, their homemade ranch is some of the best I have ever had.  Makes for the perfect topping on an already amazing pizza."}
{"text":"My boss ordered some pepperoni and buffalo chicken pizzas from Frank's today at my new job. I didn't try the Sicilian-style pepperoni-topped pie, but I did indulge in the round buffalo chicken pizza. I wouldn't say I was \"wowed\" by this pizza, but I was pleased. It was sturdy and held together well, with enough cheese and chicken to keep me content. The pizza had just enough of a punch to take it to a 3/10 on the average person's Scoville scale for the chicken and a 2/10 for the pizza overall. I'm not sure how I feel about the sauce. If I didn't know any better (and I truthfully don't), I'd say their Ranch dressing is actually French Onion Dip; a nice contrast to the buffalo chicken pizza nevertheless. Those first few bites of that white sauce were odd, but then I looked down in search of an additional serving.

Being the stereotypical new inquisitive employee (naturally, as today was my first day), I asked how often we'd be ordering from Frank's and my boss said \"once a week, guaranteed.\" Good, I'm going to get a lot more chances to taste their food!

Review #187."}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken pizza is the way to go. Good price for take out. Love that there is outdoor seating if you want to eat there."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing, especially the Buffalo chicken pizza.  Their homemade ranch dressing is the best! We have had them deliver a couple of times and have never had a problem. When we pick up at the store staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Franks buffalo chicken pizza is delicious. The homemade ranch is incredible. There are so many tasty appetizers. I have never been disappointed. Franks has 4 locations throughout the North Hills. This is the original store, and in my opinion, the best."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Sunday with my fiance for lunch.  We had called ahead of time to place our order for one large cheese pizza and were told that our pizza would be ready in about 20-25 minutes. This Frank's happens to be in the location of an old Sweet Licks.  As such it has a number of windows on the outside where ice cream used to be served and they still do serve ice cream from the windows.  It also has a nice deck attached to it with a number of picnic tables on it but has no indoor seating.  After a quick stop at Giant Eagle we popped over to Frank's to pick up our pizza and it was ready for us. Like all pizzas this one can be broken down into its three major components: sauce, crust and cheese.  The crust of this pizza was of medium thickness and the bottom was cooked nicely so it was a bit crispy but that also had the effect to make the ends super dry.  For the cheese there was a lot of it and it tasted ok but I don't think it was special in any way.  Finally the sauce which was either too bland or so covered up by the cheese that I only really noticed it was there giving the pizza some moisture.  Overall it wasn't a bad pie, just not a great one either.  I have to admit that I have had their buffalo chicken pizza before and it was pretty good, just not on this visit.

The bottom line for me is that I may head back here again in the future.  It's convieniently located to me and for the right price it is A-OK."}
{"text":"Let me be quite clear. I have never in my 12 years of eating Frank's had anything but the buffalo chicken pizza. It's that good. I know there is more than one location, and yes I have had them all, but Millvale is by far the best one to order from. All the employees tend to me generally nice and always approach me as soon as I walk in the door for a pickup. 

The chicken is broasted (which I understand to be a type of pressure frying) so it's different than usual frying. I will say sometimes they don't put enough cheese on, but if I go twice a month, they'll get it perfect 85% of the time. And when it's perfect, it's heaven. Oh and the ranch? Beyond words."}
{"text":"Game night with some friends and we were hungry for some pizza and chicken. Lo and behold, my friend happens to have a menu in her menu drawer that is from a place that has both pizza AND chicken in its name....sold!

Right on the front of their menu, they claim that they are famous for their \"broasted\" chicken and their buffalo chicken pizza, so naturally we all decided we wanted to try that. My friend who picked up the goods said that the chicken smelled so delicious that he seriously considered just pulling off to the side of the road and eating it all himself, but luckily, our food made it back to our game night unharmed.

So I don't exactly know what \"broasting\" is, but I'd like to eat all of my food in broasted form from now on. The chicken was AMAZING. Super juicy, crispy, well-seasoned...everything a good piece of chicken should be. I can definitely see why Franks is famous for their chicken. Now the buffalo chicken pizza? Meh. I mean, it wasn't bad. But I think expectations were high given that they claim that this is their signature pie. The crust was pretty good...nice and chewy. But the pie itself seemed kinda dry. Maybe not enough buffalo sauce? The cheese wasn't particularly gooey, and the chicken strips on the pizza were also a bit dry. Like I said, it wasn't bad, but no one thought it was really all that good either. The homemade ranch sauce that it comes was with quite tasty though. Overall, the consensus among my friends was that the pizza was a 3 and the chicken was an overwhelming 5, yielding a solid 4 overall for Frank."}
{"text":"I love a good Buffalo Chicken Pizza and Frank's is one of the best!  In fact, probably my favorite so far in Pittsburgh.  I had driven past Frank's several times and was always curious about it so one Friday night I decided to call in a delivery order. I went with the large Buffalo Chicken Pizza which also came with three of their homemade ranches for dipping.  With delivery and everything it was right around $20.

The Pizza itself was a decent size and arrived quickly and hot.  I tried a piece on its own first and it had great flavor but was a little on the dry side.  That wasn't a problem though because of the amazing ranch dipping sauce!  This stuff is great!  I'd buy it on its own just to have for chips or vegetables. Next time I order I'll have to ask if they sell it separately.  My guess would be yes otherwise they are missing a cash cow!

I can't speak for their other pizzas or chicken but if this is any indication, I'm sure it would be great. I'll be checking out more of their menu over the next few months.

***Update*** Tried a regular pepperoni and order of breadsticks. I highly approve! The pepperoni pizza with the ranch is amazing. Breadsticks were plentiful and tasty!"}
{"text":"Ordered the house specialty, the buffalo chicken pizza. Not terrible, but not great either. It looked great and Frank's doesn't skimp on the cheese at all, which is a huge plus in my book, but I found it to be extremely dry and kind of bland. And for a place that actually has the word \"chicken\" in their name, the chicken on our pizza was really dry and chewy to the point of almost being rubbery. The kids wanted the cheeseburger pizza and it wasn't bad either. Basically tasted like a pizza with cheese (again, Frank's is generous with the cheese. Most places would charge extra for this much cheese) and plain ground beef. It was sort of bland and didn't blow me away either. It needs some sort of special burger \"sauce\" or pickles or onions or something. As it stands, it's just \"meh..\". There are a lot of pizza joints in the Burgh and this one is decent. I'd go here again if I was close but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Their pizza is absolutely delightful! It's worth a drive to get and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Love their pizza!  Their famous Buffalo Chicken Pizza is incredible! I am a huge pizza nut & would definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. The buffalo chicken pizza and barbecue pizza is amazing. Add their homemade ranch and it is to die for. The delivery takes forever, but well worth the wait. We usually just pick up, and it's cooked perfect every time!"}
{"text":"Still love the square pizza the best!! Their Italian hoagie is a close runner up!! always great food!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh!!! The buffalo chicken pizza is the best, but the steak onion ranch pizza is really good also. Their ranch is sooooo good, nothing like it anywhere else. Not a place where you can sit down and eat but they deliver!"}
{"text":"A pretty typical Pizza and wing joint, though they have a special way to cook their wings which they claim lowers the fat count.  I couldn't taste a difference and the wings were pretty good.  Decent flavor and a pretty good crispiness.  The pizza we got was just a normal pepperoni and was just okay.  The crust wasn't crisp and chewy the way I like, instead it was a little too greasy but palatable.  The toppings were good and sauce ratio was also good. 
Their namesake Buffalo Chicken Pizza is pretty good too, but not great, it's a bit too messy and the messiness leads to sogginess and too much going on flavor wise.
Frank's is a decent pizza and wing joint.  Grab it with some beers for a Steeler or Penguin game.

You could do better though."}
{"text":"Note: This franchise is take-out and delivery only. 

Prior to the Kvelertak concert last week, I found myself with a good bit of spare time, and feeling adventurous, I walked and walked in search of this particular Frank's (we've been to the one in Shaler before, and there are 2 others), finally coming across its Steeler-colored building in a residential part of the cozy borough of Millvale.  

For $5, I had myself a small version (4 cuts) of their famed Buffalo Chicken Pizza and was not unimpressed by it. A blend of cheeses topped it, one of them being cheddar. I'm guessing the others were mozzarella and provolone. The chunks of chicken were tender enough, but it was that crust, which when coated with the cheese, almost tasted like Pepperidge Farm's Goldfish crackers but with a dimension of chew. A cream-dream of a housemade ranch dressing came on the side, and I slathered it on each cut while I sat on a public bench that overlooked a babbling stream. 

Children ran past me, old folks chatted me up, all of them good-natured, each of them wondering just who this bald fellow was and why he was in town. 

And of course, when I mentioned the band's name, eyes squinted, head's shook and the phrase \" Who? Never 'eard of 'em\" came from their mouths."}
{"text":"Buffalo Chicken Pizza--Two Thumbs up!! This pizza is no joke and goes PERFECT with their homemade ranch dressing. 

Franks Pizza & Chicken has four locations throughout the North Hills area and is take-out only; however, the drive is well worth it. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken pizza is literally the best I've ever had.  The buffalo sauce wasn't overpowering, which is a problem I often have with buffalo pizza.

Had a piece of \"broasted\" chicken which was ok.

Highly recommend the pizza!"}
{"text":"Very overpriced for a pizza shop. When my husband and I moved into our home, we wanted to treat our friends and family that helped us to some good pizza. We called 2 different Frank's locations closest to our new place and neither would deliver to us. The location farthest from us that we called last ended up being the one that delivered our food. We ordered two large plain pizza's and two buffalo chicken pizzas and it was $65. It's not like the pizzas are very big here. I will say that their hoagies and Frankie fries are delicious and my husband is a huge fan of the buffalo chicken pizza but it is just too expensive to regularly order from here."}
{"text":"Quality has declined significantly in the past several years. They aren't open when they advertise they are. Won't be back"}
