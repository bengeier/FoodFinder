{"text":"My family and I stopped here for breakfast this morning and we loved it! Fresh squeezed orange juice was wonderful and the omelettes were fantastic. The home fries were perfect and crispy and the sausages were delicious. Speedy service as well. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it was a little pricier than we thought. $45 for 3 people, but still fantastic food."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The food is so good and the service is decently fast. Their home fries are like heaven. Although my dad got a chicken breast thing as one of the sides and he said it smelled like fish, and he's not a fan other than that it's great. The prices are also very reasonable because you can get so much for so less. 3 eggs, and side of you choice (bacon, ham, etc), home fries and toast ( what I got) and it was really cheap. We are there for 4 and it costed about 35$ which is really good ( in my opinion ) overall a great place for the family or friends."}
{"text":"You really can't cook breakfast at home any cheaper. The combos of eggs and meat, home fries, toast and coffee for about or under 5 bucks is amazing. Add extra sides for a buck or two. And the menu is much more extensive for anyone who so desires, or if you go for lunch or dinner: Sandwiches, soups, burgers, and other Greek -oriented dishes are served to your table promptly and in a friendly manner.
 Too bad there isn't something similar near home here in Glendale, but it would be doubtless  more crowded, more expensive, and much more annoying. This place is neither. Canadians somehow seem so mellow and civilized. Yum. To the food. And the Canadians!  Don't ask!"}
{"text":"Went here once for dinner,  .. found the food to be over priced for average pitas .. breakfast pricing is reasonable but you pay what you get for..

Overall I find most of the giggling tomatoes to be fairly unclean, and breakfast for $5 - $6 well its not going to be at the level of Cora's or Dennys - so you shouldn't expect it to be.

Overall good for quick bite,"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Cheap food, cafeteria style service, no ambiance."}
{"text":"I was in Brampton (I know, right?) for a basketball tournament and needed a place to grab lunch. My teammates recommended this place because it was nearby and they said the menu was great. 

Imagine Sunset Grill, but not as nice. The setup in general is pretty strange: You order from a menu (hung from the ceiling on bristol board or something), then you pay, then you sit down. You have to pick up your own cutlery and condiments at the other end of the restaurant. The funny thing is, nobody tells you this, and there are no signs explaining it. When your food is ready, someone walks around the restaurant attempting to identify you by some statue they hand out when you order. Our waiter wandered around aimlessly until we convinced him that the order that he was carrying, which was getting cold, was actually ours. 

I was a little bit lost when I went to pick up my cutlery. Another customer, waiting patiently behind me, said, \"Oh, these are the spoons. That bin is for clean spoons, this bin is for dirty spoons.\" I don't consider myself a restaurateur or anything, but why in the hell would they let customers leave dirty friggin' spoons beside the clean spoons? 

The food itself is average. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. I'm pretty sure the meatballs were from Costco because I know a Costco meatball when I eat one. It came with buttered toast, even though the cashier said it didn't.  

I didn't really like my experience overall. I definitely would not go here if I knew there was a Sunset Grill or Cora's nearby. Price-wise, you get what you pay for. Maybe I'm just spoiled or have high diner standards. Or maybe I'm just traumatized by the fact that in some parallel universe, someone has used a dirty spoon for their meal."}
{"text":"Service is so poor.. Always been for breakfast. Could not have a more miserable server. Thanks for no smiles or kindness! Breakfast is no different than any other spot, id be willing to pay more to avoid the miserable employees at giggling tomatoes!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place numerous times and love it! I go to either this location (sunny meadow) or the one located on steeles in Brampton. It serves all day breakfast, lunch and dinner. When I do get to go, it's usually a sat or sun morning and can sometimes get pretty packed in there. There's plenty of booths for comfortable seating. I usually get eggs easy over, breakfast sausage, home fries and toast. May I add, their home fries are the best I've ever had! I have also tried their pasta in a ros√© sauce for dinner one time and it was pretty good. Good pricing and staff are friendly. Don't have to wait long for food and it comes to your table tasting great!"}
{"text":"Giggling Tomatoes.  Great place for breakfast and an even better place for kids (after 2pm).

I love going to  Giggling Tomatoes as they have great breakfasts for a great price.  In comparison to places like Cora's or Sunshine Grill; this place DOES NOT overcharge for the food they provide.  I think for the service and food, they are pretty spot on.

The reason I love going there after 2pm, is that kids eat free from the kids menu.

I have three girls, so when me and my wife are in a pickle...we'll go for all day breakfasts and the kids will have their spaghetti with rose sauce, and kids burger with fries and share with us.  The third is a 2yo, so she picks and chooses but it happy enough with her bottle!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a great place for good breakfast portions for cheap. HOWEVER, we went there this weekend for a quick breakfast, and it wasn't until after we had started eating that we noticed that the booth across the aisle from us had mouse droppings on the floor, not to mention the mouse hole that was carved out of the bottom of the booth's bench. I know there's the adage \"You get what you pay for,\" but I'm pretty sure I won't be going back anytime soon. I know that pest problems are sometimes unavoidable in restaurants, but when it's in plain sight of the customer in the dining area?!?! It makes me wonder what is going on in the kitchen if they are making no effort to clean it up in the dining area."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're hungry or have someplace to be. Although generous portion size for what you pay and reasonably tasty, the wait time to have your meal delivered to your table is far, far too long, especially considering the menu doesn't deviate from diner staples. Compounding the slowness of the cooks is the apathy of the serving staff, who act as though they could not care less about your inconvenience. Third time here, always the same experience. There won't be a fourth visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant (fast food place? You order at a counter and sit down to wait for your food to be brought to you) serves typical overpriced diner fare.   I ordered chicken fingers and fries to be safe (just over $11). They were cooked from frozen (same with the fries). The atmosphere is a little unprofessional. There are dirty, ripped signs from \"the management\" taped around the restaurant. The menus are hanging from dusty strings over the cash. Many of the booth seats are cracked and stained. 

The service was fine, but I wouldn't suggest this place at all."}
{"text":"The quality of the food has gone bad.  it used to be excellent when I first started to come here. The toast was stale. Customer service is horrible. The lady was so rude. I payed for eggs and water and she didn't add it. She only gave me my water then asked if I was gonna come get it or is she should bring it over to the table. Rude! Horrible customer service. Bathrooms are dirty also. The seats are tore up. My husband and my cousin also got sick after eating from here. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to come here for breakfast on our way to Toronto. We both ordered the number 2 which was 3 eggs, 3 big slices of bacon, 2 slices of toast and a very generous order of homefries. Every thing was perfectly cooked. The eggs over easy and the home fries were crispy and golden. The bacon had a distinct hickory flavour. 

The service was very prompt. We arrived around 8:15. There were few diners at that time. The girl behind the counter was friendly and smiling and very pleasant. The restaurant was clean, the coffee and tea area was self serve and set up very well and stocked fully. 

The prices are very reasonable. The breakfasts we ordered were 5.99 each. Excellent value for the money. We each ordered a drink. I ordered a 450ml bottle of minute maid orange juice at 2.49 and hubby ordered a chocolate milk at 2.29 for a total cost of 18.94 for our breakfast. I did end up getting a coffee as well. For an extra 1.79. The coffee was delicious and best of all they offer free refills. This restaurant also offers free WiFi. Another bonus. The washrooms were clean and wheel chair accessible 

All in all we were very happy with the food, the service and the price. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Made a mistake on my order called to change it. Lady who answered said \"I already asked you if there were ant changes.\" I wanted to cancel the order after said she could not. Told me that you can not cancel. Was very rude to me. Spoke to manager and he canceled it. Went there once before service was slow and servers rude. Thought I would give it a second chance, nope. Not worth it."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. The service sucked. This was the first time at this place so the person taking out order never told us to grab our own cutlery. So when she brought the food over to us she appeared super annoyed that we asked about cutlery. Her reply was \"Ok I'll bring it for you this time.\" What the heck we tipped for in the beginning when paying for our order I have no idea."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty but nothing special for breakfast meals.  Sometimes it can be a little messy but they clean fast. Great coffee.  I don't mind taking my family there."}
{"text":"This place has zero standards for food whatsoever. First off we had to order upfront fast food style then we had to seat ourselves. I might as well have gone to McDonald's and ordered there (the food woulda been better there anyways). So I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner with rice and mashed potatoes but instead got burnt chicken served with fries and potato salad. Like how do you mess up an order that bad. My sister ordered chicken and waffles which ended up being 3 soggy chicken nuggets on top of a dry old waffle. Not to mention it was served with cream cheese instead of butter (yuck).  All in all this was a horrendous experience and was very traumatizing as I was on the toilet for days after eating here (maybe thats the reason why the cashier was giggling when I came in, because she knew it would happen). This meal did not leave me giggling but instead left my stomach gurgling. DO NOT COME HERE AT ANY COST."}
{"text":"Ever since I came back to Canada this place has always been here.. I have to say that they need to update the look inside of the place cause some of their chairs in the booth are ripped..

Service here is a bit slow when you think they should be a bit faster knowing they serve mainly breakfast even though they do have other main dishes in the menu

The people taking the orders are not so friendly at times.. I think of your dealing with customers you should have a friendly personality or at least kind instead of looking grumpy..

I always order the 3 eggs with sausage bacon nd ham with pancakes on the side since I feed my son as well.. their portions are not that big compared to other breakfast places..

Overall it's an OK place not the greatest but ok and since it's close to the house I will deal with going here"}
{"text":"Went here the first time last week, and really i regret not going here before. Having been used to York's (and every where else's) overpriced breakfast food, I was really glad when I saw their morning special ($4.99 3 eggs, bacon, 2 toast and potatoes). The taste was much better (plus the fact that its pork bacon and not the nasty chicken kind is highly appreciated), the portion was decently sized and the atmosphere was great. There are a ton of seats and the service was greatly appreciated. Thinking about it, it makes me want to go back tomorrow, however im not sure if theyre open since its a holiday.

do try their hollandaise sauce and eggs. Really quite satisfying"}
{"text":"Giggling Tomatoes is good. But for some reason not quite good enough to have me crave it. It's not that it's bad. It's not. Like I said, it's good. But with so many other choices, one tends to seldom crave \"good.\" Burgers, good. Fries, good. Peameal, tasty but thin. Zet's preferred by far."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of giggling tomatoes it's a Hidden Gem and people don't really know how great the food really is. The breakfast is the best. Hands down the best home fries in Brampton"}
{"text":"We have visited this place 3 to 4 times .
Good hearty all day breakfast and customisation of ur egg cooking is appreciated by the team .
Quick service n okay pricing !"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast. This place is the worst. Not sure if it is because the cooks don't care or because they don't value customers. Every Time I ordered sunny side eggs they were over cooked, they tried to give me old sausages twice. They also have tried to give other pre cooked food to me. I always keep my eyes on these guys as they cook so they can't try to shove some old junk in my takeout box. I would not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Ive been eating here for breakfast eversince i was a kid and it's still great. The home fries are delicious, especially when dipped in their gravy although their gravy is a hit or miss type situation since sometimes the usual taste is off (barely happens but it happens)
And the steak is filling. The people there are nice, good service, it's best to go around 9 when its less crowded since around noon the lines start building. 
I personally love their cake pops (kind of pricey) but super mouth watering once you bite into it."}
{"text":"I went for a quick bite. They did not have many veggie options.  Ended up ordering Veggie Burger. It was very flat and was not even broiled properly."}
{"text":"Diner food with huge portions. I wanted a decent breakfast place, and found this one just by driving around near the airport. The prices are very reasonable compared to the rest of Toronto. I didn't notice any cleanliness issues that the other reviewers reported, so it's likely that all of that has been fixed. I had the peabacon combo, and enjoyed it. For decent homestyle breakfast in this location, I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon.  Cheap and cheerful.  Was the only redeeming thing my friends did after a terrible time at Streetsville Glen Golf."}
{"text":"This was putrid food. I ordered the Gyro Donair. It was terrible. None of the house made Gyro on a Spit for this sandwich. It was all out of the pack stuff. The tomato's were wrinkly (which meant they were old) & the \"Garlic Sauce\" was nothing but tasteless tzatziki...it was gross. To top it ALL off...the onion rings were clearly the overly flour in the bag type. Partner ordered the Smoked Meat sandwich. The bread was good but the meat was nothing but fat. All things considered a very bad meal!!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced us to this all day breakfast place.  Its really good for all types of people, ages. I mean everything for everyone. The portion is good, the entire breakfast comes in a big platter with eggs made to your choice, bread, veggies, fries, ham. Kids mostly order pancakes , juice .  Its not too pricey and the quantity is good per person. 

Another best thing about is place that i like most if unlimited tea and coffee.  The orange juice is made fresh but its a bit pricey. I always take my guests for breakfast to this place ."}
{"text":"Favorite place for breakfast. I go with my family and friends often and every time we go we are excited. It's a good breakfast place, clean and the good thing is unlimited tea and coffee. The staff is friendly and patient. Affordable price for a big serving."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. They said their SHAWARMA chicken is halal and they get it from some place named something like D and B... I can't remember the name, but you can ask.  They have some non-zabiha and pork items too.

I ordered the Chicken Giggle Super Wrap. It was sauteed vegetables in a tomato based sauce with chunks of chicken. I'll be honest and say that I didn't really like the wrap but I can tell that chicken was well well-seasoned, I will definitely return and get some other kind of chicken dish at this place.

There are lots of options, from souvlaki to burgers to pasta.

Nice clean restaurant. Good service. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"I love cheap eats! Cheap and delicious? Count me in! Giggling tomatoes is that place. I can only speak on their breakfast as I have yet to venture out and try their lunch or dinner menu BUT breakfast under 5 dollars how could you possibly go wrong? And how could you really screw up breakfast? 

Don't expect some classy restaurant with busty servers because this is not the place. I mean Helga with a mole won't be serving you either but you get what you pay for. Food is good, price is right and the place is spacious and there is more than enough room to dine it. I think this is the perfect hangover spot."}
{"text":"For the price, you generally get what you pay for. However, the service is consistently shit.  Staff either don't care, don't speak English, or both. 
Kids Eat Free is a little missleading for a single parent. Your order must be $10 or more before beverages and taxes.  There are only 2-3 items more than $6-7 available. 
Aside from breakfasts, which are actually pretty good, I'd avoid the place.

Had the steak sandwich. Paper thin and tasteless. $7.49. Would not recommend.

Tables, floors and seats are filthy."}
{"text":"The food here has a homely touch. Laid back environment, plenty of seating, and great for breakfast. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"If you want a cheap breakfast this is the place. The only probelm is that cheap = cheap food also. The food here is not going to blow your sox off. Actually you could cook eggs and bacon at home for cheaper and have better taste. The atmosphere is like a hospital cafeteria, you stand in a line order your food then take a painted piece of wood with a number on it and take a seat. Someone eventually brings out your food and you can see that they walk around looking for the colour of the wood on your table. Sometimes the people must be colour blind cause they give the wrong food to the wrong table. The reality is that it is what it is, the price is very good and the food is very cheap and bland. That being said, I would still go there for breakfast on my budget days when I want to get out of the house for cheap breakfast.

The food is not bad, just mehhhh."}
{"text":"Giggling Tomatoes is my families go-to breakfast spot in the city. We have been to the Queen/Kennedy location, but this one is definitely a better overall experience in terms of the space itself and the quality of the food.

The portions are big and the food is always made fresh to order. Despite being made from scratch, the orders are usually delivered quickly. The staff are really nice and usually willing to help you figure out substitutes.

There is an extensive lunch/dinner menu as well, but we have not explored it a lot. My wife swears by the Chicken BLT and enjoys the wraps though - often having them for breakfast. Compared to the other breakfast options along Steeles, this one is by far the best.

A heads up - the staff (I understand) do not get the tips that are on the debit machine. I try to pay my tip in cash and if I'm out I'll double the tip the next time I'm in. Staff seems appreciated and always great my family with a smile and ask how we are doing.

Other stuff:
Bathrooms are clean; No change table in the men's though (can't recall about woman's - but don't think so)
Wifi never seems to work
Coffee & tea refills (self service)"}
