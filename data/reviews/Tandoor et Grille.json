{"text":"Delicious Indian food!!  Ordered a variety of dishes, and was not disappointed with any of them.  I wanted to try everything, but I took the waitress' advice when she said that we were over-ordering :)"}
{"text":"This review is for their Greenfield park restaurant. Went there with friends, service is quasi I existent and very very very poor. Food does not seems to be fresh. We didn't even got our appetizers, lamb was undercooked and butter chicken was super oily. This is far from being Indian food it's junk!"}
{"text":"Went there many times before it changed hands
And put up price and reduced choices on buffet
Still good food but short on desert and they should bring the fish back and have daily lentil soup and speed up service a bit"}
{"text":"From the salad to the sizzling plate to the amazing dessert, this restaurant really has the best authentic indian/pakistani food available in Montreal. The staff are very professional and the restaurant is clean with lovely interior. Be it a la carte or the buffet menu in the reception hall, the quality of the food is never compromised. My husband is very picky when it comes to a perfect butter chicken but here he was extremely satisfied! The naan is so soft that we always have to keep reordering it every time we go! 

This place is ideal for parties, wedding receptions, lunch buffet with work collegues or a nice date after a long week @ work!

P.S.  We got married in the reception hall and all our guests were super impressed with the quality of the food! :) ;)"}
{"text":"Great Food ! Felt like we are actually eating in a restaurant in Pakistan.. Great tasting original desi food !"}
{"text":"Great delicious indian restaurant. Nice ambience. Their food is less sweet than some others as they probably cater to the more authentic palate. The butter chicken is awesome"}
