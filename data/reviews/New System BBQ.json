{"text":"Pizza - 4/5 - great cheese and crust
Smoke Meat - 4/5 - large portion and classic Montréal style

I was a little hesitant of ordering new system as I passed by their headquarters frequently and have a hard time believing quality can come out of that place. I was proved wrong. 

Pizza was great! Crust was not soggy and the topping tasted fresh. Other than the lack of sauce, it was a solid slice. 

Smoke meat was outstanding. I love smoke meat a little slimy, and they delivered (literally and figuratively). 

Solid choice when you want greasy late night food or to cure your hangover."}
{"text":"Things to order: pizza, subs, fried chicken, gyros, fries
Things to avoid: nothing.

Once you get passed the weird old school decor, you can begin to appreciate the amazing food that this place puts out.  

Mountains of cheesy, crispy goodness.

One of Montreal's best pizzas, some of the best subs I have ever had.  Amazing fried chicken.  Open late for the ultimate post-drinking food.

They deliver as well but best to eat in (cheaper, hotter, and bigger portions)."}
{"text":"Completely disgusted by not allowing trans woman to go to the bathroom that corresponds to her gender."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.
Do not go eat there, they do not care about any customers.
The waitress wouldnt even let me order what i wanted because she said it was too complicated for her to punch in and than when I asked to speak to owner she told me he doesnt want to speak to me. Very unprofessional and rude"}
{"text":"Food is good but very expensive and extremely rude staff. I used to order from them about once every two weeks, I made a order once and I hade to cancel to go to work, I called them not more than 5 minutes after I made the order to cancel, the lady that answered took it personal that I had to cancel she was very upset and rude. 2 days after I call back for a pizza and they said I had to make an order of $50 minimum punishing me because I cancel a few days earlier. To treat customers like this is unacceptable , take it from me people just call miracle pizza there down the street from new system friendly and amazing food"}
{"text":"This place has hands down the BEST pizza in Montreal
It's just the new system special pizza is like the closest you'll get you a Chicago deep dish anywhere in the city.
I really like the fact that they have really tasty pepperoni and that the mozzarella cheese has the distinct taste and texture you'll only find in a high quality mozzarella.
If you love pizza and you haven't tried the pizza here yet you have to try it...."}
{"text":"If you're planning on eating here, you should ideally just take out or call for delivery. I went here late one night and felt like I was an imposition on the staff. We walked in and waited a few minutes before the waiter even noticed us, despite there being no one in the restaurant at this hour. The waiter brought a cup to fill up with water, the cup hadn't been cleaned. I politely asked for a clean cup and got one. However, the experience was really sub-par. The waiter clearly didn't like their job and was taking it out on the customers.

The food is acceptable for a diner, but again, I would not recommend sitting in to eat."}
{"text":"Horrible costumer service never going back again. Racist owner! Such a shame. Went there with my friends and we just got kicked out cause the owner said we cant be there."}
{"text":"Good pizza mais service de marde !!! La waitresse la plus vieille des deux etais si fâcher a cause Jai commander take out ét Jai décider de manger la !!!! Voyons criss de conne ma te laisser ta pizz ét crisser mon camp par contre la plus jeune etais fine"}
{"text":"Everything tastes like Clove!   The subs,  the pizza and gravy..  Unless you love Clove do not eat here.."}
{"text":"retro 80 dive that serves huge plates great food and friendly service.. the menu is big and they have alot the chicken is done to perfection and they are the king of the fries on the block .. if you got to decide between the 4 other places in the area New system wins hands down"}
{"text":"Breakfast prices are amazing. The service however is not.  Waiting over 10 minutes for a menu is unacceptable.  Only receiving one menu for two people is outrageous.  After ordering the plates came relatively quickly with the smoked meat missing from both of our plates, once again waited a long while before being able to tell the waitress as she was not around.  The cook was then arguing with the waitress and she shows up with both of our missing smoked meat on one plate.  I was unaware that I would be sharing my meal with a colleague of mine.  Will give it another chance in the future."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for fried chicken and this place got me! I love their fried chicken with honey! It's not overly greasy where you can see the oil dropping out it has a nice crunch to it! My only thing is the poutine is always dripping with grease! Too much sauce just over flows it. But the chicken is so finger licking good!"}
{"text":"Few questions to the people who give them anything more then 1 star...do you not have any taste buds at all ? Are you aware at how low the food quality is?

Simply disgusting.

The pizza taste like warm crappy doughy puke worthy pizza. Pepperoni I don't even want to speak about.

Poutine- the fries are always mushy so that's just awful they're sweet a bit the sauce or fries either or it's just wrong. The curds are terrible.

I really want to know how the business stays a float. I paid 17.95 for the worlds worst bambino soggy pizza served not in a box but a crappy metal and plastic container. And poutine. I was more happy to throw the food out in the alley then actually eat it."}
{"text":"Five stars and one dollar sign. These reviews are completely wrong. Fresh, well cooked food and lots of it. Great service. Yelp has let us down."}
{"text":"One of my besties highly suggested this place and vouched that they had the best fries in Montreal. I really wanted to like it for him but it sucked! I've had the best fries in Europe so I know my fries. The food was very basic and unfortunately I will not be back for the fries or anything else I had."}
{"text":"Excellente pizza vraiment très généreux sur la garniture. Petites erreurs lors de la commande mais la pizza qui a été livrée était succulente, nous étions 4 collègues de travail à se partager le tout et juste en regardant la pizza le lendemain plus d'une dizaine de mes collègues commandaient de ce restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the thing about restaurants that advertise quick delivery: you probably shouldn't eat there.

My problem, however, is twofold. 

I have ordered from new system at least a dozen times. The delivery is quick, the pizza is edible, and the prices are reasonable. The woman who answers the phone is something else. 

New System is old. It is brightly lit. It has photos of when Athens last held the olympics on the walls. If you sit close to the washroom, you smell it every time a staff member opens the doors. 

We ordered an all dressed pizza with a side of onion rings. The waitress was perfectly kind. She didn't know what HP sauce was but we got it anyway. The onion rings came from the supermarket down the street I'm sure. She smiled and nodded and welcomed every request so I don't blame her for anything. I'm fairly certain she was New on the job. 

We ate our meal and left. 

Having ordered from New System in the past, there was a time somewhere in the past week where I needed a pizza in a hurry. So I called in spite of my qualms with the restaurants cleanliness. 

I was placed on hold. Intermittently the associate would answer the phone, only to tell me \"un moment\" and then go back to another call. Every time I answered: \"what?\"

She eventually answered me and I couldn't understand a word. I speak French. I live in Montreal. I asked her if it was my turn to order and she mocked me, repeating the words I said. 

\" Quoi? Quoi? \" 

I asked if it was my turn to order again. 

\" Quoi? Quoi? \"

Lady. I had half a mind to walk to that restaurant and tell you what I thought of you. I wanted food, you gave me attitude, and I'm sure by some miracle you still have your job because you've been there for so long. 

Next time, don't be rude. Tell your client that you're busy and you might take a while to take the order. I only wanted an all dressed pizza and I live two blocks away. 

Eventually we got into a spat and cussed each other out. I hung up and ordered from Angela's. 

I just wanted a pizza. 

Nouveau système? Plutôt vieux système. Madame qui répond aux téléphones aura du prendre des cours de gentillesse. En plus le resto sent la merde. J'ai vu de la poussière datant de 1982, j'en suis sur. Change le système, change de téléphoniste. 

I want nothing more than to keep a saint Henri fixture in place, but, good god! be a proper fixture."}
{"text":"Normally I'd give them 3 stars but after last night, not happening. 

My girlfriend and I both suffered from food poisoning from last night's chicken.

And if there was any doubt, eating it as a left over today and falling sick again confirms it. My girlfriend told me to not do it. I should have stayed away the second time. Oh the pain!

I won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant est indéniablement une institution du quartier Saint-Henri. Principalement, pour la livraison, vous pouvez manger en salle à manger, qui date des années 60. La flotte de Volkswagen orange que vous voyez sillonner les rues du quartier à vive allure fait partie du service de livraison du Nouveau Système. 

Pour une bonne pizza avec de la garniture à revendre c'est assurément la place. Demandez la pizza \"Spéciale du chef\", vous serez rassasié pour les trois prochains jours. C'est une pizza toute garnie (champions, poivrons verts et pepperoni), viande fumée (smoked meat) et olives vertes. Mmmmmmmmmmm!!! Je salive simplement à y penser. Aïe! C'est dur d'écrire des avis et perdre quelques kilos."}
{"text":"I Just moved in the neighbor hood and I went to eat there and it was very good and I thought I had found my new breakfast joint. But my boyfriend went there again a couple of days later to have a coffee and use the wifi since ours is not plug for a week because we moved. Before he even finished his coffee (30 min) the waitress brought his bill, since he wasn't even finish his coffee he didn't pay immediately. Then the owner came personally out to personally kick him out even if it only been 30 min and he didn't finish his coffee. Oh and by the way there was only 8 clients in the big restaurant. My boyfriend was in shock, he didn't pay for his coffee cause come on he only had time to drink half of it!

So I don't recommend this restaurant because of the owner who is completely crazy. Kicking people out who want to stay an hour to drink a coffee and read the paper or do some homework on the computer!!! Come on and don't have free wifi if you don't want people to use it!"}
{"text":"I don't really know why I decided to come here today. Maybe because it made the news a couple of ago. It just stroke my curiosity to come and take a look at this place that's been around since the forties.

Tried the leg+poutine combo. Leg was a bit dry and the poutine was not especially tasty. Customer service was ok, not warm but not lacking either like some of the previous reviews indicated.

Don't think I'll be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"I don't give one stars but this place deserved it. First we walked in and we greeted rudely by the waitress. So we sit down and order. I had to go to the washroom at that point and was absolutely disgusted by what I saw. Mold everywhere and just plain dirt that hasn't been washed in forever. After sitting back down and ordering, the owner, who is an obnoxious and loud person begins swearing in back of us to one of his customers. The customer was complaining that when she ordered her food, the cook was actually peeling pieces of the chicken as it was cooking to see if it was ready. Not sure if it was true but she seemed honest in her complaints. The owner did not want to hear anything of it and asked her to get the F*** out. After eating there tonight, I honestly believe her 100%. I would never go back there again... I will attach pictures of the bathroom in another post."}
{"text":"Tried the fried honey chicken and the rotisserie chicken. Both managed to be crispy yet juicy, and the meat itself was marinated and super flavorful. The fries that came with it were perfectly double-fried and the sauce had good flavor. Very good coleslaw too. Service was not great, they were understaffed and stingy on the napkins and the honey. But the food more than made up for it. It's a much better value than the chicken place next door since the plates come with fries and slaw."}
{"text":"Institution de Saint-Henri et de tout le Sud-ouest et même au centre-ville pour son excellent poulet rôti et son poulet frit au miel exclusif, juteux et délicieux.
Un menu déli et fast food très élaboré complète le délicieux menu BBQ.

Le service sur place est rapide et courtois, la livraison super vite et ça vous arrive chaud même un 29 janvier!

J'adore ce spot tard un vendredi ou samedi soir quand tu reviens d'une soirée arosée et que tu as faim en rentrant dans le quartier à  3h du mat.

Les voitures oranges patrouilles loin en plus pour vous livrer des portions géantes!   D'ailleurs le RQQP ( Rapport Qualité-Quantité Prix)  est extrêmement bon et favorable envers le client.

Un must quand vous venez dans le quartier."}
{"text":"Our new favourite place. 
Huge portions, good prices, fast service, tasty foods, specially chicken. 
We love their poutine too.
Debit card no problem.
They also have delivery."}
{"text":"Greek and hot dog fast food, many tables , old business. Why not if you feel greasy.. livraison disponible."}
{"text":"The Good: The smoked meat is consistently good and is available any time before 2:30AM. An older gentleman named Mike is running the till half the time. He's always very nice. 

The Bad: The price is a bit high. The smoked meat special (a pickles, fries and KFC style coleslaw) with a soda is going to run you $15+. 

The Ugly:

1. Fry buckets appear to be kept on the floor... and then stacked. That is it would appear that they take the bottom surface of a bucket resting on the floor and then place that surface on top of fries they will later serve. 

2. The drivers are the restaurants outward face for most people and are a plague on the neighbourhood. New System's drivers speed through nearby area including the nearby school zone, pull illegal u-turns, and are very loud late at night during the week. 

The Even Worse:

Living nearby I have visited New System countless times for late night smoked meat. It is a bit overpriced but it is close. I continued visiting New System after one of their drivers nearly ran over my *leashed* dog. I stopped going to New System after a driver nearly t-boned my girlfriend and I in our car, ***laughed***, and then drove away. 

When I went to speak to the manager about the fact that the driver, pulling an illegal u-turn, had nearly hospitalized my girlfriend, the manger (owner?) simply said \"Ok\" and stared at me blankly. 

I have never seen customer service worse than that demonstrated by management/ownership at New System."}
{"text":"They say even bad pizza is good. Not in this case. $30 tax in for a lazily assembled pie with no love and way too much cheese and canned veggies. Cheese and toppings slide right off the dough. Sauce was watery. Very disappointed.  Delivery was quick,  which I guess is the only positive. Would have waited twice as long for something half decent."}
