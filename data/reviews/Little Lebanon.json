{"text":"Good shawarma and falafel, and I also love the chicken pita pocket things.

This place can get hot in the summer - the oven is always on, like at a pizza place."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Most places we go we ask for extra  donair meat- when we said this the lady asked us to see how much they originally put on and see if we still wanted more- which we didn't! Lots of meat, amazing donair sauce, super friendly staff, good prices and wicked baklava."}
{"text":"Little Lebanon holds a special place as it's the first kebab joint i went to when i first arrived here.

Best pockets in town, get the freshly baked chicken pocket and you won't regret it. The kids love the cheese pocket too. 

If you're feeling adventurous, get the dips, hummus and babaganoush (eggplant). And the owner usually gives you a baklava (or two) for free while you wait for your order."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and love the complimentary baklava while waiting in line save my for dessert, chicken had a nice flavour to it will be back again."}
{"text":"This is my fav Lebanese place in the city!! Amazing baklava too. 
Everything is made right in front of you, and it's quick too! Can get busy at night, go during the day!"}
{"text":"Great Lebanese place in Calgary.  The people working there will give out free baklava if you are waiting in line. I go there a lot and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Crystal, a fellow ex-pat Bluenoser, and I are on the hunt for the Calgary donair which most resembles the king of donairs ... the Halifax donair.

We initially went to Brothers, a site I have enjoyed in the past, but it's closed due to the Ctrain relocation. The owners want to open it elsewhere but have yet to find a new location.

Little Lebanon has always been a close second. The meat is a tich on the bland side but the sweet sauce is pretty darn good. We could have stood to have a little more drippy in the bottom of the bag, though.

It's passable and the atmosphere is pretty good for a quick in-and-out. The guys on the counter are super friendly. When one of them thought some random guy butted in line in front of us, we got free baklava.

And who doesn't lurv free baklava?

The quest, however, continues. I am quite excited, though, to have found a knowledgeable partner in crime for the great adventure. 

She grew up on the perfect donair and has a rather refined and discriminating palate. 

Medium donair: $6.50
Extra meat for the dog: $2"}
{"text":"Ordered $5 meal, and owner tacked on an extra $1.25 but then was \"kind enough\" to give me a free baklava to see as if I hadn't noticed...  food was good, and reasonably priced, but can't approve of his dishonesty"}
{"text":"Great food! The wraps are amazing and the baked chicken pockets are the best.  Big portion sizes and great food"}
{"text":"I wish Little Lebanon was closer to me. The restaurant is clean and bright, the food is fresh and even though it took a little while ( my spinach pocket was made and baked when I ordered) 
It was worth the wait.
My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed the Shishtawouk platter. He would have bathed in their garlic sauce given the choice. 
The service was friendly and as a treat, they give you a little baklava with your meal for free."}
{"text":"Little Lebanon gets 5 stars because I couldn't live without it. From the Manakesh to Baklahva it's all good. 

My favourite on the menu has to be the Chicken Shawerma! Juicy chicken grilled on a vertical rotisserie spit loaded into a pita bread with tons of veggies and as much garlic sauce as your friends can handle... heaven! Add a side of Tabouleh and the meal is complete!

The owners are very generous giving each customer s complimentary baklavah with each order! 

Great food, great people! Make sure you visit!"}
{"text":"Bright clean, interior and friendly (although sometimes slow and disorganized) service. Shawarma and Donairs are in contention with Jimmy's in terms of size and flavour and the platters/ pita pies are also excellent. Often times you are rewarded with a free baklava as a consolation for the sometimes backed up lines. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"Little Lebanon is the place to go for authentic Lebanese Food. Centrally located on 17th Avenue SW.

Nice, clean location with friendly staff."}
{"text":"I need to start off by saying holy cow, the renovations are ahhhmazing !! My first time here was over a year ago, the food was great but the atmosphere turned me off a bit from going back. 

I recently moved into the neighbourhood and decided to give it another try. I didn't even recognize the place ! The food is still amazing but the interior and ambiance is what really sets the place apart from other middle eastern eateries . It's bright , spacious, and most importantly .. clean !!!

I ordered a regular size beef donair and was incredibly pleased . The prices are great as well! I will definitely  be a regular from now on !"}
{"text":"Stopped in today... it was very busy with take out traffic. Staff were very friendly (even after I changed my order when I saw what they were making for my husband). and the baklava.. hmmm. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is very friendly. Everything is made in front of you. The place is clean. This is the place for a fast affordable meal that is anything but ordinary."}
{"text":"Just had a beef donair and a kibbi ball, it was decent but nothing spectacular IMO.
I had big expectations several leb coworkers ranted about this place.
I feel more spices are needed in the meat."}
{"text":"After randomly walking into this place, I was advised by a customer in line to order the pockets, which consist of your choice of ingredients placed in dough and freshly baked in the oven.  They were awesome.  I came  back within a week to have another because the first was so good.  Other menu items also looked good."}
{"text":"My worst chicken shawarma ever. I'm Mediterranean and know a bit about this kind of food.  Chicken meat with no flavor and little bit of meat (\"little\" from the name of the restaurant! ) and a lot of salad. ..the owner put $$ on reno and cut on meat.....
I won't return and I won't recommend.

Mustafa"}
{"text":"My Sisters Husband always goes here, and now I know why. Unlike some other places where the meat sits all day. This place is so busy that everything is always fresh. Plus I think the food is more authentic and true to their roots. I find the servings large. So value for the money is good."}
{"text":"Last week I had the privilege of eating there large Donair.  Was amazing flavor and topped off with a small piece of baklava for free.  

The tv menus and lighting is very good.  As you order you have a full view of the kitchen and prep areas, they are very clean.  

Lots of deli type foods and desserts to try.   Will be back again and again"}
{"text":"Being from Ottawa - the shawarma capital of Canada - I had a hard time trying to find a really good Shawarma.  This place is the closest it has come.  Everything is fresh.  The Chicken is perfectly seasoned.  The Baklava is delicious and they give a free piece to everyone.  The rice and lentils very good.  The cheese and meat pies are delicious.  Fatoush dressing not too lemony.  The garlic sauce seems to be mixed with mayonaise and not pure garlic, but that's okay.  I eat here every chance I get."}
{"text":"OMG the BEST donair I've ever had! It's called the donair pocket and it's stuffed full of fresh veggies and juicy donair and smothered in amazing sweet sauce made the original way if your passing by there and your hungry stop in and try it! Btw you also get a honey drenched crispy baklava FREE"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The donair here is as good, if not better, than what I've tried in Lebanon. Best donair in Calgary by far!"}
{"text":"Friendly, helpful staff. Generous servings with affordable pricing. Sometimes get a free baklava with your order :) great authentic taste. Wait time can be longer than usual depending on your order but food is fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of family run, hole-in-the-wall establishments. Fast, friendly service that delivers tasty donairs. Not a big fan of the shawarmas, but the quality of the other food makes up for it. 

Not much in terms of atmosphere, but more often than not, you'll get some free baklava while waiting for your food which is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of donair/shawarma/gyro players in YYC. And there are a lot of excellent examples of great execution. Most are 4-5 stars. 

Little Lebanon sets the bar, IMO. And their pocket, while being un-Lebanese, is an original concept worth trying. 

Super place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good shwarmas here, although the donairs aren't the authentic Halifax-style. Our beef was a bit cold and dry today, but it was still alright. Not as good as Jimmy's A&A Deli, but waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyy better than My Donair."}
{"text":"I had the large chicken shawarma (with everything): $8.50. They are generous with the meat and the seasoning was tasty. The shawarma was almost as good as that of Shawarma Station in Kensington and would have been equally good had it been toasted. 

I gave it the same rating as Shawarma Station because the price is more reasonable for what you get. If you're in the SW and in the mood for a good shawarma I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best manakesh in town , we had meat, cheese, and Zaatar it was phenomenal. ..very fresh amazing taste..a must try in calgary.Im visiting from Seattle and  it was a great experience. ...very clean very professional and tasty...the owner Bastiah greeted us ..greet customer service...I will definitely come here again"}
{"text":"Great pitas. I go here for the baklava.   It is a good price and tastes really good.  The place is clean and the staff is very friendly.  I have bought baklava here and given it as gifts to our employees, it is always appreciated.  Better than donuts."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite some time. My highschool was right across the street from Little Lebanon, my friends and I would hang out outside the restaurant on our lunch break.(this was back when it was that little hole in the wall) My jaw dropped when I seen the new renos, they've come quite the long way. I've tried alot of things off their menu and never have been disappointed. Whether you're feeding a group of people, or just yourself on your lunch break you couldn't do better than Little Lebanon. 
I would recommend the chicken pocket, the Lahem b' ajeen, or a classic donair. 
There's lots to choose from to fill your belly!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The chicken pocket is so awesome and if you don't know what to get they're so friendly behind the counter they'll tell you what things are and what to try."}
{"text":"We dropped by yesterday  on our way to Edmonton to see the women's World Cup - based on other yelp reviews. The food was great and service was fast. We ordered the chicken shawermas and the red lentil soup. Free baklava was such a nice treat."}
{"text":"This has got to be the top donair shop in town. Lots of flavour, and even the donair seems to stay together, without much mess. They're doing something right."}
{"text":"Ever since the renovation, the food and service has gotten worse. Everyone is disorganized, slow and they look confused and unhappy. The produce doesn't look fresh, but tired and old. The prices have gone up too. Too bad, I use to like eating here."}
{"text":"Outside of building looks a little rundown but the inside is really nice, very clean.  Donair was excellent!  Currently living in California so I always make sure to have a donair whenever I am back in Calgary.  Will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"So good. Love there food. The mixed pockets are my favorite. Great food. Great service"}
{"text":"I recently visited around dinner time on a Thursday night. The restaurant looked nice as it was been recently renovated, but the counter setup seemed inefficient which was leading to slow service. Rather than a normal assembly line setup, both customers and staff were having to bounce around through the ordering process.

After being unimpressed the the service, the food didn't do much to add to my enjoyment. The meat was fine, but the hummus was bland, the pita was not as soft as would be desired and the side salad was just meh. 

Sad to say, but the highlight was a free slice of baklava offered at the register."}
{"text":"Awesome mixed donair with the sweet and garlic sauces and the baklava is sweet and nutty just like it should be!"}
{"text":"IT may have just re-opend.  But the smell of sizzling shwarma and hot meat pies is amazing.  Cooked to perfection and for the same price as a stale sandwitch thats rotted on a shelf at some cafe.  This place is always busy and you'll have a hard time to find a seat.

This is for sure a \"must\"  in calgary.  They do real arab food here.  The only dissapointment is no beef-shwarma and DONAIR (puke).  What you buy as today as 'donair' is usually cooked minced 'who knows what' on a stick.  The real stuff is the hand made spindles of cut meats, not what is marketed today as 'donair' which comes from a factory."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food!
I tried Chicken pocket several times and also had falafel sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Everything taste so fresh and well seasoned. Try their pockets and you won't be disappointed. Actually you'll want to eat another one even before you finish yours. The selection of fatayers and the sweeties are delightful. Really like this place!"}
{"text":"A friend said we should go for pockets. I had no idea what that meant but he raved about them, so off we went. 

Some of the most delicious Lebanese food I've ever had! We had the Mixed Pocket (think of it like a Lebanese take on a calzone but without cheese). The meat was full of flavour, the pocket was cooked perfectly, and the garlic sauce was to die for. I asked for extra, it was that good. :) 

Any time you're in Calgary and you need a quick meal to fill you up, this is your place! The staff are great, and atmosphere is warm, and the food is even better. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I added a star as I just found out about the pockets....like a donair calzone. Saw one come out of the oven and changed my order. U will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Recently Renovated, this little Lebanese restaurant, was mainly takeout, but now there are quite a few seats, and busy place, they have great donairs, shawarma, and many other speciality Lebanese dishes. The owner is great, the service has always been good, sometimes a little wait, as they are very busy, also the owner gives customers a piece of baklava complimentary, a very nice gesture. My favorite item is the zaatar , a fresh baked pita with a thyme based spice mixture,serves hot from the oven. This \"little lebanon\" is a treasure waiting to be discovered. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Seriously still amazing amazing food. The owner is often a bit quite and hard to get to smile but one of the nicest guys I have talked to. His other staff and family are super nice. Manakeesh zaatar are awesome especially the loaded with toum."}
{"text":"Absolutely monstrous - be sure that's the size of your appetite is before you head here. Came in from Canmore to visit friends in Calgary, and ended up eating here two nights in a row. Although Sunbake Pita creates my favourite pitas (sometimes known as balady bread) in the province, I have to say the brand Little Lebanon uses (Byblos Bakery, surprisingly) is a close second. Fresh, fluffy, a little bit of chew and with the flavour of the oven. 

And the fillings! The shawarmas are exploding with chicken (does anyone bother to get the beef?) that is well seasoned and juicy, served with fresh crisp pickled cucumbers, turnips and peppers, other garden toppings and with parsley, sriracha (!?) or extra garlic sauce if you like. If you ever think the staff aren't filling it up enough, just encourage them to add a little more. They seem more than happy to do so. 

Although our group divided into two camps over what was better, the pockets or the shawarmas, rest assured if you go with either, you will come out happy."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon after 12 noon but not quite dinner time and to stomach is rumbling a bit. Driving on 17th Ave SW I spotted LL which have driven past for years and heard from friends that the food is solid. We dropped in, reviewed the menu and sat before our first meals from LL. WOW - I had a small shawarma with the garlic sauce  and it was loaded with chicken that represented just the right amount for me - I can only imagine that a large would have been the whole chicken. Excellent value. My usual place is Tazza in Bridgeland - I felt as though I was cheating but both places are solid.

The ingredients were fresh, hot and tasted very good. We sat up at the counter and watched the world go by on 17th as we ate. The dude came over twice to ask how the food was and to chit chat - when we left he thanked us for coming. Yes, a place thanking a customer - \"I'll be back\"!"}
{"text":"Gotta have the chicken pockets. Tasy chicken and delicious toppings baked in fresh dough. Cheese pockets are amazing here, but very rich."}
{"text":"Little Lebanon seems to be the equivalent to Edmonton's Sunbake Pita Bakery. They make everything fresh, made to order but their selection of eats is more diverse than Sunbake's. We came for a late Saturday lunch, around 3:00pm, and the place had a consistent flow of people coming in and out. I can see why.

Just look for the sign. They're located across from a McDicks. Interesting that there's a Korean place right beside them. Will have to check them out next time!

LL did renovations over a year and a half ago. The inside is clean, bright and there's ample space if you want to dine in. That's always tricky to find with Lebanese joints as they're usually grab and go spots.

Menu starts off with plates. Don't think you can go wrong with any of the three options. There's also the typical donairs, perfect for if you come solo. The manakeesh is one of my favourite things to order. They even have pockets! Salads so that you can put some healthy things into your body and lastly, mezes. I like how there's two sizes for all these. That just means you can try more things out!

The dessert is in a separate display case to the side but all of it looked really good. I'm not 100% sure but I believe they get their baklava's from Manara Baklava Factory. That's my guess based on the set boxes you could buy.

- Humous original ($4.00 regular)
- Baba ghanoug ($4.00 regular)
- Tabouli ($5.00 regular)
- Fatoush ($4.25 regular)
- Kafta plate ($14.99)
- Lahem b'ajeen ($6.50 loaded)
- Manakeesh zaatar ($4.25 loaded)
- Spinach pocket ($5.50) 
- Baklava"}
{"text":"The place is located in the corner of 17 ave se and 35 st and has lot of parking. It has open kitchens and offers you choices right upfront. They have the quite a lot of lebanese options to chose from. Salad, shawarma, pita wraps and plates that come with pita bread, sheesh taouk or shawarma with the sides of rice, garlic potato/hummus and fattoush. A note, if you need tzatziki sauce it's a dollar etc. They also have a bakery that serves baklava,  cookies and samosa. The staff is polite and friendly.
Coming to the food. The garlic potatoes are nicely done and have just right amount of garlic flavor. Fattoush is fresh and carries the real taste. Sheesh taouk is authentic Lebanese taste so is the tzatziki sauce. They throw in an extract piece of baklava with the plate. Great place for Mediterranean cravings."}
{"text":"The renovated and bigger version of the old Lebanese restaurant behind Westbrooke train station.
They have really good sandwiches, donair, falafel and etc.
One reason I go there is because of the free Baklava you get with the food :)"}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday late afternoon for a donair pocket. Service was slow and unenthusiastic. I stood in line and no one was very friendly. A simple acknowledgement of -hi, be with you in a minute - would have been nice. Hubby waited in the car and only after 10 minutes did someone put my order together. I noticed that some customers at the register were offered free baklava and some reviews also mention that. Nope, no smile or baklava for me! Guess I don't qualify... after all that, I finally try my donair pocket. The bits of char on the bread was OK and the meat was very bland but moist. I'm unsure what the hype is about as I've had many other donairs in this city with better flavour. I know it's all about personal preference. I may give this a 2nd try to be fair but found my first experience to be subpar."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, friendly service and sparkling clean! 3 things that make for an awesome choice to sit down in this little cafe and have a quick lunch. I recommend the falafel if you're looking for a meat alternative. You get to enjoy a home made piece of baklava at the end of your meal as well and it's one of the best I've ever had. Take a drive up the less trendy part of 17th ave for a change and try this out!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. They are always busy because the food is so awesome. I've been here several times & yes there's often a wait, but the staff are friendly and often offer a free piece of baklava for your wait."}
{"text":"Very nice inside and friendly owner! I'll definitely be back. Great chicken shawarma. Also had some samosas but they were only okay I would say. Free baklava was really nice too. I felt appreciated which is important to me."}
{"text":"I follow this place on Instagram and finally went in today! My falafel wrap was so good. I will definitely be back... Maybe a little too much. ;) also bought a bag of spinach fatyers, can't wait till to dig into them!  I highly suggest you visit this place for some really great authentic Lebanese food. The place is clean and the staff is very friendly. Oh free buklava...yes please!"}
{"text":"Ok, I thought I found my favorite place in Calgary for Shwarma and the like with the Cedar Deli, when I was introduced by John Gilchrist to the Little Lebanon.

Wow.  From start to finish, I was quite impressed.  The second I walked in, they offered a nice little amuse bouche of Baklava for me to snack on while deciding my order (sadly, being allergic to pistachios and almonds, I had to refuse).  Then when I did order a Chicken Pocket (with all of the typical veggies and so on) and a Chicken Shwarma sandwich (no, not all for me, I don't eat THAT much normally...), they prepared the filling of the pocket in fresh dough, and ran it through an automated pizza oven to ensure that warm fresh taste.  

They didn't skimp on the veggies, the meat was cut fresh and was nicely seasoned, and they offered both white and brown pita options.  And when they found out I couldn't eat baklava for health reasons, they then gave me this awesome little beef turnover instead to try out.  All in all, it was a pretty pleasant visit, and they will see me much more often even though I have to make one heck of a detour from home (its like 25 blocks out of the way for me... but its worth it).

The place itself is fairly simple in decor, and down the basics really, but they make plenty of fresh dips and personal savory turnovers and lebanese pita \"pizzas\" (apologies, never really knew the name) covered in herbs and spices or with a form of ground meat \"sauce\".  Still, it works well for them, as it was 8 pm at night on a tuesday, and there was still a line up for food so they're doing something right.

So, that's my tale as I rode off into the sunset, with the staff of the Little Lebanon waving me off as I disappeared over the horizon (or actually just turned left around the corner on 37th st sw on the long trek home...)"}
{"text":"The donairs & shawarmas are very good, but they have other delicious things as well... The hummus is delicious, and they have some kind of bread homemade, that is just delicious!,.. Also, they have different cheeses, that are great!.. And the juices, are really good!,.. I really like this place when I don't want to cook!!.."}
{"text":"There are few places that I love as much as Little Lebanon.  If you've never had Lebanese food... Come here and don't be shy to ask questions.  The owner and his staff are gracious and hospitable.  My go to is a small chicken shawarma.  My last bite is always the delicious complimentary baklava."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place is always busy!

   This is an amazing Lebanese restaurant.  Do not think that the strip mall location isn't worth stopping for!  It is worth the wait-and often you get rewarded for your patience with free Baklava!  
  My favourite is the stuffed chicken pita.  This is fresh pita dough stuffed with typical wrap toppings and fresh baked.  The Fatoush salad is also delish and never heavy.  
  You will not be disappointed by this little gem!"}
