{"text":"Average pizza could be better!! And the portion size is very big like who needs a 28 inch pizza slice"}
{"text":"Great go-to place for tasty pizza on the Southside, especially where pizza places tend to come and go. (Benny, Please don't go!)  I've lunched at Benny's a few weekdays. The service is pretty good, friendly and fast, even with a lunch crowd. The decor is fine, lots of wood, pretty standard and there is a reasonable amount of seating. I  believe they are open pretty late for the bar-hoppers appitites.

The super-sized pizza slices provide a nice portion size for only around $5/slice. Fun to eat and I don't think I'll get over the novelty of it. I would go more often, but I try not to eat too much processed flour."}
{"text":"Fortunate to have Benny's here in the Southside. A VA gem that snuck over the Mason-Dixon Line. Ridiculous large 30\" pizza NY Style, cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Uniquely large slices which is pretty neat. However, wasn't impressed with the quality. Felt like mall pizza. They threw an already cooked slice back in the oven for a few minutes and served it. Not exciting. I'll give it another shot before writing them off completely, and update if we have a better experience."}
{"text":"Very yummy NY style pizza for a great price! A slice of cheese was $4 and pepperoni was $5, which you can't beat on the south side! Full of flavor and you won't walk away hungry... They also have a good selection of pops to choose from, even some I have never seen before! The ranch was not very good but amazing pizza!"}
{"text":"First time at Benny's, the slices are huge and very delicious. Loved the vibe inside and Nick was great to talk to. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza I have had! Will definitely come here anytime I am in Pittsburgh! Highly recommended!!  loved it!"}
{"text":"Friends had been raving about this place so much in the last few weeks that I had to try it just to shut them up, and i'm so glad I did! First of all, the slices are HUGE, two paper plates per slice. Benny's has the right amount of toppings, the perfect crust (not too doughy, not too hard) and just the right amount of sweetness in their sauce. Best Pizza in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We have grabbed a slice here several times.  They definitely get the prize for the biggest slice in town.  The pizza is very good and they always have a few speciality slices to choose from.  My only gripe is consistency.  Most of the time the pizza is hot, fresh and good.  Sometimes, like this visit, it seemed like it was old pizza that was \"jazzed up\" a bit.  Mine was a spinach and ricotta slice, which was pretty tasty.  The cheese slice that was given to my kids seemed to have been sitting a while, so they just threw on some new cheese on the top and put it in the oven.  Maybe it was just because it was for the kids?!"}
{"text":"My life has changed since stopping in Benny Fierro's randomly on a Saturday night. Benny Fierro's is a chain offering up the \"Virginia Slice,\" which really just means \"ginormous.\" One slice of pizza here literally sits on two paper plates. However, it's not just a huge slice; the crispy, paper-thin crust, topped with slightly sweet sauce is just amazing. My favorite part is definitely the crust, which is kind of difficult to describe. It has a very nice balance of crispiness and softness that you've just got to try for yourself to understand what I mean. 

A plain slice will set you back $4 and a pepperoni or one of their specials will be $5, making it an awesome place for a quick and cheap meal. Benny Fierro's is also open late, which is totally perfect during or after a night out in South Side. 

I don't venture down to South Side much anymore, but Benny Fierro's has definitely given me a reason to!"}
{"text":"Yay! Giant slices of pizza that I will say are BETTER than Pizza Sola (and Pizza Sola was a good pizza). Awesome collection of artisan sodas, clean and aesthetically pleasing decor, excellent service.  


Definitely a better addition to the South Side than Scientology."}
{"text":"I don't know if you need to eat this right in the shop but we ordered from Postmates and it was bad.  Just very bland all around.  Would not recommend.  Must have high ratings from the drunkards eating late night."}
{"text":"Large slices, generous toppings...  you're typical New York style pizza.  When I'm in the mood for thin crust- this is our 'go to' spot.  Open early / open late, friendly staff..."}
{"text":"This is simply perfect for late night drinking/hunger munchies food. The pizza is super huge so go hungry."}
{"text":"O.k., so this little Benny Fierro's has been in my neighborhood on the south side for quite some time and I have heard few things about their pizza.  My only experience was seeing gigantic pizza boxes laying out on garbage day that said Benny Fierro's on them.  \"Home of the Virginia Slice?\"  Ummm...what does Virginia have to do with pizza?  So, I strolled in and ordered one slice of ham and pineapple Hawaiian style.  It was 5 dollars and I was expecting a rather big piece, so I did not order two. 
  2nd and third visits - I went back to this place for the specialty slice and liked it on the second try.  As a matter of fact I have changed my entire attitude since then.  I am not sure why I didn't exactly like the first time, but I have really liked their pizza since then.  It is one of my favorite places to buy pizza by the slice.  It is a good balance of ingredients and it is not overly greasey, which is a pet peave of mine.  The entire pie is sooo huge I don't think I would ever need that much pizza, but they are great to stop in for a quick bite.  Plus they have really interesting soda's and teas I can't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best 3 pizza spots in the Burgh, right up there to Fiori's and Mineo's, and it's definitely the  best pizza in the Southside. The NY-style slices are as big as 3 slices of an original pizza at a standard pizza joint. The ingredients they use are of high quality, and the sauce is just right and is seasoned to perfection. The crust is also crispy and scrumptious. I have been going here for more than a year and eat here minimum 3 times a month, and I have never had a bad slice from here. Also, if you're having a party, you only need one whole pizza. $30 for cheese and $38 for toppings, the 28\" pizza will feed a an army. Service is good and friendly, and they're open until 3 on Friday and Saturday. Hand's down must-have pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Especially after a drunk night on the town this is a go to spot. Pizza slice big enough for two people, reasonable prices, room to sit and eat, chilled atmosphere, cool employees, public restrooms, etc. I love this place"}
{"text":"This pizza is great! And I'm really happy we have a place like this in south side now! But I like dipping my pizza in ranch and I was really disappointed in theirs. Its definitely just hidden valley squeezed into a container and sold for $.50 other than that the pizza is really good especially for the price I just wish they had their own \"bar-style\" ranch"}
{"text":"Went to this place to see just how big the pizzas are after hearing about it. Its true they are HUGE. They're $30 and topping I think was 5? They only make one size so I hope you're hungry. The pizza was good but nothing special. Just a giant classic cardboard pizza."}
{"text":"Is it the best pizza I've had in my life? No. Is it the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh? No. However, it is definitely the best pizza on East Carson right now and the closest thing to Pizza Sola which sadly closed a while back. They have your standard toppings, but also will have a specialty pie once a month. I typically just stick with what I know unless a special is really speaking to me, but everything that I've ever had here has been pretty solid.

I'm probably in the minority when I say that I've actually eaten here sober more times than drunk. As Benny's is open after the bars close, I can imagine that this is a great spot to get your drunk food fix.

If you're a New Yorker and used to dollar slices, you sadly won't find that here. The slices are about five bucks, but they are huge. The crust is usually just the right amount of crispy, and the sauce is really good! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a late night slice of pizza after frequenting other local establishments on Carson street. It will run you $5.00 a slice and there are a few flavor selections, although I've only had the pepperoni. Don't let your eyes fool you....one slice is enough, trust me. I bought two with lofty goals last week and ended up throwing the second one away because I was stuffed and did not want to hate myself in the morning. I rate this place 3 stars for a couple of reasons, it's good - not outstanding, and I wish they would give a girl a box when they see she is going to get a slice to go. Walking a few blocks back home precariously balancing two paper plates is a chore. I will absolutely be back, maybe to try another topping combo."}
{"text":"If I lived in NYC and had this pizza, I wouldn't return, BUT Pittsburgh's pizza selection is really wildly low.  I will visit BF's again because we are in Pittsburgh.   I have only been once and here is my review.  The crust was correct for a NYC pizza and that is about impossible to find around here.  Most Pittsburgh pizzas are undercooked and even if you get a pizza cooked enough the crust is super chewy.  Benny's pizza is not super chewy, it is like what you would get in NYC with a nice crunch and a tender center.  The sauce was a little light on flavor.  It could use a little more cheese.  I will return, but like I said, if this was in NYC, I wouldn't.  This is the closest place to a NY slice in Pittsburgh.  Interestingly, they only have whole pizzas that are huge for $30 or more.  I don't mind that too much, but wish they had one other size.  I am happy they ONLY serve pizza and have limited selection of toppings.  That is what you want because the quality can be high and ingredients fresh. NO wings and other stupid things, thank goodness!"}
{"text":"Benny Fierro's is an awesome experience! They have HUGE pizzas- you can order by the slice or go nuts and order a whole pizza! The whole pizza is great for parties- we have gotten it a couple times and it feeds so many people and amazes the crowd every time. The slices are great too- I love their traditional pizza or their unique flavors like the thai chicken. Overall, an awesome pizza place that any pizza lover should experience. Beware- it gets packed here on weekends."}
{"text":"One of the top 5 pizza joints in Pittsburgh. Grab a giant, thin, crispy slice of NY style pizza for $4-$5, sit in the window and do some first rate people watching."}
{"text":"Finally a clean comfortable place to eat pizza on the South Side!

This is a cool trendy spot with descent pizza that is roomy and clean.

The pizza is HUGE !

IN THE BACK IS ALSO A SMALL ART GALLERY! Definitely a place to chill and get a bite to eat!

I will be back!

P.S. They do use yeast in their dough so you can expect to have gastric explosions all the way home!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Huge slices with great taste. We always have to stop in for a slice when in the South Side."}
{"text":"Benny is the biggest pizza in town.

I had a standard pepperoni and a pizza of the month. Both were great.

The crust was well cooked but still had a nice chew to it. The sauce and cheese portions were good.  The portions for the toppings were good

The pepperoni pizza was pretty dry on top and the plates after had minimal grease. No need to dab oil off these slices.

Benny Fierro is by far the best pizza in the south side. I'd rate Spak Brothers as my favorite in the city still."}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunch. $4.00 including tax for a huge slice of plain is hard to beat. They are usually not super busy during the day. They have slices precooked waiting for you to get in and out. There is a parking lot right beside them so it's real convenient."}
{"text":"So so good. I am a big fan of the NY style pizza and Benny's doesn't disappoint and the jumbo slices are so awesome. They are like the equivalent of two regular NY style slices at some other pizza shops and only $4 per slice. They have a limited number of toppings to choose from which is how it should be. I got the cheese pizza and really loved the super thin crust that was both chewy and crispy."}
{"text":"Huge DC-style slices that take two plates to hold. One slice is all you need. Much better than any of the other slice places in the South Side. The sauce actually has flavor, and the cheese is a higher quality than the other shops the line E Carson Street.

They have pizza and nothing else. Cheese, pepperoni, sausage, and two pizzas of the month. No wings, no salads, no gyros, no pasta, unlike all of the other generic pizza places around the city that are completely undistinguishable from one another.

Not the best pizza in the world, but a good slice in a city where they are hard to come by."}
{"text":"Loving Benny's. Good thin crust pizza. Prices aren't bad and pizza will last for days even if you have a healthy Pittsburgh appetite."}
{"text":"This is the single best place in Pittsburgh to get a slice of pizza. It's bigger than your head, so start with just one slice, not many people can finish more than that. And in my opinion you shouldn't order one with toppings since they're not cooked in the pizzas, they're just added on top and reheated. But it's an excellent slice, New York style, thin crispy crust, zesty cheese. One small criticism, I wish they'd keep a container of Gel GRANULATED garlic to sprinkle on top, not the garlic salt that they have since it makes the pizza too salty. 
If you remember Pizza Sola on Carson St., that used to be good, but it is GONE now. It was bought out and renamed almost identically as \"Sola Pizza\" and is no longer any good. Benny Fierro's is almost as good and a bigger slice. Decor isn't anything to write home about and the staff are \"minimally functional\" at best, so you're not going here for the ambience."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Benny's for the first time for lunch and got a slice of the Buffalo Chicken pizza. The slice was MASSIVE. It's a little thicker than your typical NY slice, but it's one of the better options for pizza on East Carson. I live a block away from Benny's, so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You cant find better pizza in the southside. The best part is that you only need one slice!"}
{"text":"Last night was our first visit here despite always walking by.

I ordered a mushroom and garlic slice. My boyfriend ordered the daily special of jalapeno and bacon. 

My slice was delicious. Most pizza places around here always taste the same, but this slice was very flavorful... Not to mention insanely huge. Slices are about $4-6 depending on what you get.

I highly recommend. You have to experience their giant slices atleast once."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here after a long night of drinking and dancing. Their pizza slices were huge (like the size of two pieces of pizza) and delicious. They were super friendly and gave us each a side of ranch. Hurrah for Benny's!"}
{"text":"Don't expect to be able to order anything else except pizza here.  Pizza by the slice that is.  As a newcomer, I asked if they have slices of pizza.  Thank goodness no one else was around to hear such a ridiculous question. Ridiculous, because they only had slices.

Another thing not to expect is meeting Benny Fierro.  Benny Fierro does not exist.  However, there is a Benny_____ and he learned the craft of making pizzas while working for nearly 2 decades in Brooklyn under the direction of Italian chefs.

Unknown circumstances led him out of the area and he settled in a small town situated on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, where he continued making his signature 28\" pizza pies. These signature pies are now served at various Benny's locations.  Each Benny's adds their own second name or description to their individual site to help ensure the anonymity of the real Benny.

There are 17 locations , the majority found in Virginia, several in North Carolina, and one lone location In Pittsburgh, Pa.

Plain slice was $4.00.  Quite reasonable for the size and quality.  
Cooler filled with soda and various other beverages.  No beer is sold but you can BYOB."}
{"text":"Went to Benny Fierro's on a quest to find the best pizza in South Side while I'm here for the summer. I knew the pizzas here were big, but seeing them in person still had me in awe. However, for me, when it comes to pizza, size matters not.

I started off with a cheese slice to get a taste of the bare necessities. The crust was thin and crispy, just how I like it. The cheese was nice and gooey, and the sauce had some good flavor. The only problem was that it could've used much more sauce. After finishing that slice, I was struggling to decide whether I wanted another since it was so filling. I figured I had to try something else, so I went with the pesto chicken pizza (which I think is a summer special). I was expecting some integration of pesto into the sauce, but it was simply a cheese slice topped with pesto chicken. The chicken was tasty and well cooked and was a nice addition to the pizza, but it would've been nice to have a bit more pesto.

Overall, the pizza was delicious and a contender for best pizza in South Side. The service was friendly, the prices were a bit high ($4-$5 a slice) but considering the size of each slice it's not that bad. I'd definitely go back to try some other options."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I ate this sober, so my review is completely objective. In a city filled with phenomenal pie, Benny's surprised me by holding its own. As other reviewers have stated, the slices are big. Like bigger-than-your-head big. The pizza had a nice cheese to sauce ratio (heavy on the cheese). The bottom crust was slightly thinner than I prefer, but the end crust was thick and doughy. I did find it a bit greasy, but for $5 a (gigantic) slice, what more could you ask for?

Compared to its competition, this is for sure the best pizza in South Side."}
{"text":"Best new pizza place in the south side area! I was soo upset when pizza sola closed down and then was taken over by new owners...but i have found my new go to in Benny's. Ginormous slices for $5 each...$1 cans of pop. You can stop in and get full on $6 even! I love it...hope you guys are here to stay! Seems like you have made a great impression thus far. You'll be seeing me. Keep a slice of mushroom hot!"}
{"text":"We were in search of good pizza and we found it! The slices of pizza are absolutely huge. They need 2 plates to serve them and they still hang off the plate. We ordered our slices and sat down. They were ready within minutes. It is a no frills kind of place but they also seem to do a booming take out business. We enjoyed watching people come in to pick up their pizzas in boxes that barely fit through the door because they were so big. You almost have to have the address to find this place because there is no big sign, only a sign on the window. This will be a must for our next visit to the area."}
{"text":"Giving Benny's a \"5\" in the pizza category (though would give it a 3.8 in the overall restaurant category).  Easily my favorite pizza here in the city and dare I say I'm not sure I have had a better slice anywhere else in my travels around the globe.  Glad to have this small chain represented here in Pittsburgh with a spot on the South Side."}
{"text":"Absolutely best pizza on the south side hands down!!! Service was fast and the guy making my slices was extra Intentive. I destroyed both slices which was full of flavor and that crust.....the best I ever ate"}
{"text":"THE PIZZAS ARE THE SIZE OF YOUR HEAD.. and etc!
This was my first place I came to grab a bite after I stepped off that cramped ass 8hr Greyhound bus ride from NYC to Pittsburgh, just to visit one of my girlfriends. The first thing she put in my hands was a margarita and of course a hug... and a few squeals in my ear. Lol 
It was just past 2:30 AM. People were carrying out pizza boxes the size of a twin mattress! The line was long and full of semi-sober to not-so-sober college students.
So you done know this is a GREATTTT sign. Drunk people do not like waiting! No one stands on line for shitty pizza. Esp college students. Straight facts!
Moreover, in NYC, the only place you see a line for pizza is at Grimaldi's in BK. So I knew this place had to be Littt.. yes you read that correctly. LITTTTT!!! 20 mins later we got to the counter. I ordered a Pepperoni slice and my girl and her friend ordered a regular cheese slice. I slipped away quickly to wash my hands. When I came back, a slice the size of a 3 month old human was sitting at my booth! The cheese slices were even huger than pepperonis! Let's conceptualize this. Just imagine half a Domino medium pie. Now cut it in half. Yes. That one half of the pie equals a Benny's slice. Guys, I KID YOU NOT! I didn't even know what to do with my self but dash the usual garlic powder, hot-sauce and seasonings on my slice and dig in! 
One bite in and I was entering the gooey, ooey cheesy gates of Pizza heaven! You know that moment when you bite into something so damn delicious, your eyes roll back into your head and your mouth springs water from the flavors. I was having a relationship with my Pizza in South Pittsburgh and I didn't have to go to Italy like Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love to do that! 
Ahahahaha. I kid. But yes, it was that real. 
Benny's Fierro's, you got me. I'll forever frequent this spot whenever I'm in Pittsburgh craving a good slice away from NYC."}
{"text":"Biggest pizza ever! Service was quick and friendly and it was well worth the price. Ordered by phone and it was ready for pick up in less than 30 min."}
{"text":"I wish I could do 3.5 on this one. But I can't justify doing 4. Is it the best option in Southside? Definitely. Unless you travel down to the works and hit up Michael's. 

Went in on a Tuesday around 9 just to grab one to take home. I got 2 slices for myself to go because I didn't want to be limited with just one haha but I could have just had one and been good. 

First off, both the garlic sauce and ranch dressing were not good. However, I did really enjoy the sauce on the pizza. The crust was just ok to me. And all around it was pretty decent just not something I would need to go back for any time soon. 

The kicker to me is I ordered two slices to go and the to go was just on paper plates and in paper bags. I understand that I didn't pay for a whole pie buy considering I paid $10 and that's the price of normal small pies, I think they could have some cheap boxes. Especially since 2 slices are the size of some pizzas. 

Will I go back? If I'm down here super late night and need pizza, absolutely. Just because I want pizza, no."}
{"text":"Couldn't carry it out had to get help just getting out of the door. Good pizza for a good price"}
{"text":"I love this place soooo much! I honestly was not originally intrigued by Benny Fierro's because I thought it was a little much to have these massive slices exist and I didn't really believe they would be as amazing as they are! But wow! My two friends kept telling me that they have been ordering jalapeno popper pizza from Benny's and that it was amazing. I felt compelled to give it a go and I have zero regrets, aside from not going sooner! The slices are gigantic and about $5 each, depending. The crust is thin and crispy. The sauce is not overly sweet and the toppings are all so good! The jalapeno popper pizza was a special for the month of July and had jalapenos, bacon and beer cheese on it. Goodness! I have also had their pepperoni, sausage and this month's special, chorizo and onion. I am fully obsessed with this place! I also kind of like that they only have water/soft drinks instead of having a bar. There is no temptation to grab a beer with your slice and up the bill ten-fold. Cheap, delicious and filling...that's all one could ever ask for in a slice of pizza!"}
{"text":"For those with late-night hunger pains, or interested in an incredibly satisfying greasy blend of cheese, tomato sauce, and crispy bread to really hit the spot, look no further than this welcoming pizza shop.

The staff is so down to earth and friendly, and the ambiance is low-key and generally quiet.

Things i liked:
-Each pizza slice is the size of your head (on average). 
-Reasonably priced for the portion size and quality
-A satisfying pizza to \"hit the spot\" when you're in the mood for something savory, greasy, late-night
-menu changes periodically (basil and balsamic was my favorite!)

Things I didn't like:
-toppings can be low quality e.g. mushrooms that look like they came from a can

Overall, a great place to grab a hefty, filling slice of pizza! They will not disappoint, just don't expect anything gourmet."}
{"text":"Wow, you guys. Wow. 

Does anyone remember the days of Pizza Sola and how huge their slices were but also how sort of lacking in awesomeness of flavor they were? And also the creepiness factor of them always having pizza sitting out for who knows how long and they'd just warm it up in the oven for you? 

Well, this place has none of that nastiness! It's right in the swing of things on the Southside and was surprisingly chill for being 9ish on a Saturday night. My friend raved about this place for the past week, but I was skeptical due to other slice based places in the area that were big in quantity but lacking in quality. 

The slices, as you can see in my photos, are in fact huge. Two plates worth huge. The best part? THE FLAVOR! THE FREAKING THIN BUT CHEWY IN A GOOD WAY CRUST! THE FACT THAT EVERY GINORMOUS PIE IS MADE TO OTHER AND IT DOESN'T SIT UNDER A HOT LAMP WAITING TO BE SNEEZED ON. 

My slice was still bubbling and steaming when it came out of the oven. Do you think I waited for it to come down to acceptable temperatures before tasting it? Pffffft, you must not be familiar with my posts then. This pizza was delish in every possible way, and is appropriately priced at $4 for plain and $5 for a one topping slice seeing as to how you're easily getting three normal slices in one. 

It also happened to be the Southside art crawl, so there were a few bands playing and free beer offered. I had Rivertowne Grateful White and it was great! The not so great was the first band that played...the music was entirely too loud for the small space of the restaurant, and you had to yell at the person next to you to hear them at a whisper like level. Seriously dudes, next time you let a band play there tell them to turn the flipping amp down. The second band was lovely and had a smoother chill wave jazz vibe which I liked, mainly because of the 100% acceptable noise level they were giving off. 

I'll be back to see if this night was just an exceptional fluke or if this is really one of the best slices I've had."}
{"text":"Humongous slices and they're at a relatively cheap cost, but they taste excellent. The crust is just right, the ingredients are quality, and they have the perfect balance between sauce and cheese. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Okay so if you want great pizza on south side go here. Not a disappointment. Slices are huge! It's BYOB. Low key spot and great pizza. Service was great too, very nice. Also a good place when you leave the bars at 2am and want a slice to take home."}
{"text":"YAY - Pittsburghers rejoice!  Finally a place to replace Pizza Sola/NY style in Pittsburgh.

We stopped in on a random Wednesday at around 3PM to try them out and grab a quick slice.  We ordered a basic pepperoni which was really good.  Is it the best pizza I've ever had in my life?  No.  Is it high on my list of a basically non-existent NY style market in Pittsburgh?  Absolutely.  The service was great, chill guys working hard that really want to see the place succeed.  I will happily be back (probably at least once a week) to continue to support them!

Pro-tip: Don't be dissuaded by the $5ish slice prices, these slices are HUGE and totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great little pizza joint in the South Side. Small menu, easy ordering. Pizza slices are New York style, thin and crunchy crust. Slices are huge 12\" slices. Mine had pepperoni and sausage. You either have to fold it in half or hold it with both hands, and that's pretty much not enough. Great pizza, traditional taste, pepperoni and sausage were tasty, good sauce. Dependable everytime we go, excellent pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. The slice of pizza I ordered is the biggest slice I ever seen.  Really good local pizza joint that makes amazing pizza"}
{"text":"When I first saw the size of a slice of pizza at Benny Fiero's, I assumed it was just a gimmick and the pizza wouldn't be very good. Boy was I wrong! The pizza is thin until you get to the end of your slice and that's when you start to get full. Eating more than 1.5-2 slides would be impressive. 

I ordered delivery from BF's once and the pizza box was so large that I had to angle it to get it to fit through my front door! For $30-35 you can feed 4-6 people which isn't too bad and it's fun to eat such an enormous slice. I did the math - one slice at BF is like 3 slices of XL pizza elsewhere, but keep in mind it is effectively thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"I had wanted to stop and eat here for awhile. I was so happy we finally made it there. The gentleman working was very nice and he explained that they always have cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, sausage pizza, a veggie pizza, and a special of the day pizza. We bought a piece of sausage and a piece of BBQ Chicken pizza. We thought we would start with those and then try another piece or two . . .until we saw how enormous their pizzas are!!!!  I have never seen pizzas that huge!!! . Each piece of pizza was $5. Plain cheese is $4. Whole plain cheese pizzas are $30 and others are $35. The pizzas are so big that you could feed two to three families from one pizza. The sausage is not your typical sausage. It is sliced and the size of pepperoni and not crumbles. I wish that they weren't sliced so thin. It was very good. The BBQ Chicken was our favorite of the two. The BBQ sauce was finger licking good. The chicken was real. It was in nice size chunks. I wish the pizzas had a little bit more cheese on them but the pizza is very good. The pizzas are very thin crust until you get to the edge where it's more like a typical hand tossed crust.  Even though the crust is thinner it stands up to the toppings. 
Take a group of friends and go try it. Enjoy all of the artwork o the walls!!"}
{"text":"I've ate pizza here a few time my favorite one I ordered was a spicy chicken pizza with banana peppers and chicken and a few other things on it. The cheese on the pizza was phenomenal I also love that the crust is thin. The slices are huge you can share a slice with your friend since they are so big and it is super cheap especially after a night out drinking it's definitely the place to go for some munchies. Not only do they have good pizza they have BYOB and nothing is better than that. The service is also amazing my favorite pizza chef is Nick M he's the best!"}
{"text":"Reminded me of a good few places from back up north in New England. The size is where pizza should be at. Well worth the walk in the snow."}
{"text":"Love this pizza, had it on a Pittsburgh Bits n Bites Food tour.  Gonna head into town to get a whole pizza today!  Yum yum, it's a crust I can and want to eat ALL of and it's cheese blend is fantastically delicioso!"}
{"text":"This pizza joint's signature is serving up huge slices and pies. They're as big or even bigger than the ones served up by Pizza Sola. Unfortunately, the flavor of the pizza doesn't measure up to the size. The crust wasn't very crispy. The end of the crust was pretty much a bread stick. The tomato sauce didn't have much flavor, and the cheese wasn't as savory as I like.

I would rate Benny Fierro's two and a half stars."}
{"text":"Simple pizza, nothing too fancy. But the slices are HUGE! A friend recommended that we get a slice to share, but that sounded weird to me so we got our own slices, and MY WORD, was I wrong. One slice is equivalent to 3 normal slices. They make whole pizzas that's can't fit through the door. A slice of cheese pizza is only $4 & is VERY filling. I'm sure I'll be back at some point if I'm in Southside."}
{"text":"Since moving to Pittsburgh four years ago, I have been searching for great pizza.  I'm looking for a thin crust, chewy and crispy, with the appropriate amount of sauce and cheese. The problems I've run into with most Pittsburgh pizza are many. In most cases, there is an obscene amount of cheese and the topping are underneath it, which means the cheese can bond with the sauce and adhere to the crust. When you bite into it, the toppings cause that thick later of cheese to slide off in one bite. Drives me crazy. Aiello's is good, but its not great. You know who makes GREAT pizza in Pittsburgh? Benny Fierro's on the Southside.  First of all, their pizzas are enormous. One slice is just about enough. Next, they make it right - thin layer of sauce, the right amount of cheese and toppings on top, where they are supposed to go. Finally, everything tastes perfect. The sauce has good flavor and the crust is delicious.  Get a gargantuan pie from Benny Fierro's for your next football party. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh hands down. True NY style. Huge slices, thin and crispy crust. So excited this place is finally open!!"}
{"text":"Excellent slices of thin crust pie with tasty options like garlic and mushroom or chicken, ranch and cheese. Huge portions of pie and great place to stop in and have some good pizza right out of the oven. Great ambiance too."}
{"text":"Overpriced pizza on cracker bread with an odd cheese blend and soggy meat.

I got the pepperoni slice. Its a large piece of pizza. The crust is excessively thin and crackery. There is no chew. The cheese is too cheddary and not stringy enough. The pepperoni was not crisp or flavorful. 

This place reeks of being the victim of profiteering ownership and low quality craftsmanship."}
{"text":"Great cheap hangover food. You already know the slices are huge and around $5. But they are so good too. I had the chicken bacon ranch and it was really flavorful. Friendly service. Great stop on Carson."}
{"text":"On the hunt for a local pizza place after a night of drinking, we found Benny's. Luckily we got there right in time to get the 2nd to last pizza of the night. We had no clue what to expect. We watched them put a pizza in the oven and saw how HUGE it was. Thankfully realizing it wasn't ours. But wait, there goes the next pizza in, ours, and it was just as big! They boxed it up for us and we were on our way. However, our Uber was a little small and we couldn't even fit the pizza in! Laughing hysterically we had to hold the pizza on our heads just to get it to the hotel. 

My eyes popped out of my head when I saw the size of the pieces. It was as big as my head! Amazing crust, great toppings, chewy cheese, and 100% great pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! Pizza is FANTASTIC and huge slices! Staff was very friendly and chatted with us the whole time we were there! A must if on East Carson Street!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I had in Pittsburgh. And certainly the biggest slice. Crust is perfectly crisp, sauce has the perfect about of sweetness, with the perfect amount of cheese on top. 
Service was great as well. 
We will back. And recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Pittsburgh. Great service and takes only a few minutes to make. Never been disappointed. Location is prime in the heart of south side. The special pizzas are very unique and a must have. Recommend this place if you are in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"best pizza in south side. huge drink selection. awesome atmosphere. $4 for a slice that could easily feed 2 people!"}
{"text":"If your looking for a slice this place is nice.  You get a piece that takes two plates.  The pizza was good.  The dough was pretty good but my piece probably needed a couple more minutes in the oven.  It is a thinner crust but puffy on the edge. The dough had a nice taste but a little under done."}
{"text":"As a Jersey girl, I've grown up being spoiled by NJ and NY classic pizza. Throughout my time in college in Pittsburgh, I've encountered my share of pizza restaurants that attempt to replicate this classic east coast taste but fall short. However, that is not the case with Benny's! The pizza is awesome, with slices that are the perfect thickness and have the optimal tomato sauce to cheese ratio. Additionally, the slices and pies are huge, with one slice as big as a person's head! Definitely filling.

Also convenient is that Benny's is open late on the weekends, which is helpful if you want a bite to eat after a night out with friends in South Side."}
{"text":"This pizza was out of this world good!!!!  We stopped after a Cubs win over the Pirates and was a perfect end to the night . Staff was extremely friendly and some of the best pie I've ever had!  Definitely highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good pizza, huge slices, nice new addition to the south side. A pizza with two toppings runs about 40 dollars but don't let the cost get you down. The slices are huge and worth it."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! The slices are huge and it taste amazing with the crispy crust and then  gooey cheese and awesome toppings.  My favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"I saw this place while I was walking in south side with a friend. All I wanted was a slice of cheese pizza. I went in and saw it was $4.. I was surprised but bought a slice anyway. When I got the pizza I was like oh that's why it's $4. The pizza was huge and takes up 2 plates. The pizza tasted delicious and the crust is crispy. I enjoyed this small little gem!"}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!
The sauce is so good. Absolutely yummy. 
You think a New York slice is big? Those slices ain't got nothing on the size of a Virginia slice.
Honestly it's true that a piece is as big as one's head...or in my case the size of my arse (which is plentiful)!
Slices about $5 each which is the way we usually go, 
However, we've on occasion bought an entire pie which by the way is 28 inches. No joke, it's enormous.
You'd think pies this big wouldn't be Cooke properly and may be raw/doughy. Not the case. Cooked to perfection.
Worried about leftover? You'll have them for days. 
So glad Pittsburgh is one of a handful of cities that's home to this smaller pizza shop chain.
 Pepperoni pizza here is my favorite."}
{"text":"This is really good NY style pizza.  Thin crispy crust.  Go get a slice, it will take up 2 plates!"}
{"text":"Benny Fierro's is a chain of pizza shops from Virginia who has recently opened up a location on the bad pizza gauntlet known as East Carson Street.  You probably won't recognize the name Benny Fierro's because each location that they open is given its own specific generic Italian mobster last name.  This place is definitely new and it shows..I tried to call in an order but \"the ringer was broken\".  When you walk in the door you are greeted by a really hilarious mixture of bad art motifs...on one side there is a huge mural or what if I can remember correctly was some kind of crazy animal, I an not sure if the mural is unfinished or just bad.  On the other wall they seem to be going with the random antique/tin sign on the wall motif...the cross country skis and canoe must be on back order.  

When browsing the menu at Benny Hoffa's a certain question comes to mind which is \"where is the menu?\" There is no menu because Benny only offers pizza...which only comes in one size...which is comically over-sized....cut in 8.....which costs 30 dollars for a cheese pie.  Unfortunately this is a gimmick pizza shop, which is a shame because the pizza is actually pretty close to being good were it not so terribly inconvenient. 


The pizzas at Benny Bagadonuts are made in a brick deck oven but unfortunately they use screens underneath them while cooking so the dough ends up a bit raw in spots underneath the sauce. The middle of the pies are so paper thin that the dough can't really hold the toppings so you end up pretty much being forced to eat the pizza with a fork and knife or to fold it in half. At about halfway up the slice the dough starts to even out to an appropriate amount.  The crust of the pies are super thick and puffy and almost hard to eat...I almost didn't eat the crust, which is usually one of my favorite parts of a pizza. The cheese distribution on the pie would be perfect if the middle wasn't as thin, the cheese was evenly distributed and pulled all the way to the edge of the crust.  The sauce was somewhat ample and distributed pretty well across the pie as well.  The pizza could have been cooked a bit longer and was still pretty soft on the bottom.  If they didn't insist on having such a puffy crust than they could flatten it a bit and actually have a bottom thick enough to support everything. 


One thing that stands out about the pizza here is the dough, which I think has a lot more fat in it than most Pittsburgh shops.  Benny Buttafuoco's dough has a nice bready fatty salty taste to it which helps it achieve some sort of crunch despite being made on screens.  I'm not sure if they are using shortening, butter, lard or what but it definitely is a lot more rich than the dough found in most shops around here. The dough has a somewhat medium density, not too dense but definitely lacking the fermentation to make it nice and bubbly.  I would be super curious to try their dough cooked directly on the brick but I can't imagine anyone that works there being able to slide a pie that large off of a peel (or a peel that big even existing).  In general the dough has a great taste with a mediocre consistency.  

I think Benny is using mostly mozzarella cheese although it almost tastes like there is a hint of muenster in there too.  The cheese is high quality and melts well without charring.

Benny Mascarpone's sauce is fine.  They are using decent tomatoes and the consistency is a medium thickness which is pretty desirable for me.  The taste is slightly one dimensional...and the dimension is garlic.  It's not an offensive amount of garlic I just wish that I could taste the tomatoes more.  There seems to be some herbs in there too but the garlic is taking over.  



In general this pizza is still pretty good by the standards of this city and I will probably continue to eat a slice here once in a while but overall the pizza is not good enough to justify its own ridiculousness.  Pizza is supposed to be easy, convenient and cheap...you aren't supposed to have to tilt it to fit it in your front door, somewhere along the way Benny Lemonjello forgot that.  This place is a fun gimmick for drunk people who want to marvel over an excessively large slice of pizza.  The menu would make it seem they have no interest in selling pizzas to families or businesses, only to drunks. If they would take the same ingredients and offer an 18' pie it would taste much much better than the pie they make now because it would be made better and would cook the whole way.  E. Carson Street has seen shops with better pizza than this close (pizza sola for example) so if Benny Piscopo wants to make it in this city he is going to have to step his game up.

{"text":"If you've spent any amount of time in the Adams Morgan district of Washington, D.C. (or anywhere in VA, really) then this is not a new concept. Enter the jumbo slice o' pizza! This place conjured up memories of drunken stupors w/ friends in search of anything edible after the bars closed down, then waking up the next a.m. only to find pizza sauce splatter on the crotch of your favorite pair of khakis. I digress. BF's pizza, be it slices or whole pies, are thin but simply colossal. While not my favorite pizza in da 'burgh, it's a true-blue go-to for late night eats. Order. Wait. Eat. Repeat. Oh yeah, it's also of the few places you can get Cheerwine in a glass bottle."}
{"text":"So, i get that this is sort of a \"concept\" joint, with the biggest slices I've ever seen, but i don't care!
First, the dough. It's thin, but cooked PERFECTLY. The crust is doughy, light, and F R E S H tasting. The sauce is what i would say is traditional - not sweet or too packed with herbs. A nice layer is added to the za, deff not overwhelmingly saucy. The cheese is again, exactly what i think of when i think of a traditional za. Unlike some shops, they don't chuck on a lot. Just enough. Bubbled nicely, not too greasy. 
I just got the cheese this time around. I'm embarrassed to say i couldn't finish the whole slice! Next time, going in on an empty stomach! 
As an aside, i wonder if they will ever have pizza eating contests??"}
{"text":"Pizza is the size of three slices! Garlic, mushroom is the best toppings! They are fast, clean and polite. Recommended for late night eats."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!! The pizza is delish!! The slices are huge!!! But the best part was the service so friendly and welcoming..It was our first time and it wont be our last."}
{"text":"I just moved into the area, and everyone always rants and raves about how amazing Benny's is. I thought it was 100% local just because of how much of a hometown feel is in this place - even though they have other locations, you just feel the Pittsburgh charm of this one. Enormous slices the size of your head. Quick service. Games always on TV. Youthful crowd - which gets pretty loud and crowded on weekends. 

Staff is incredibly nice and everyone working there is very charismatic. Makes you feel right at home.

Only real complaint is the $5 slices. It's a little insane. I'm a originally from Bronx, and we have slices just as big for $1 in New York, but hey, the pizza is pretty alright. Overpriced for how it tastes, but it's still wicked good. A definite \"must-eat\" if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I was here with friends a few weeks back and I must say I was quite impressed by the pizza they serve. They have huge pizza on the display which is quite appetising. 

We ordered mushroom pizza and hot lips (I remember pineapple as one of the toppings). Hot lips was quite an amusing name!! They give huge slices of pizza and one slice is like a small pizza you get at regular pizza joints. They are also generous with the toppings they give. One slice is totally worth the price!! I prefer adding extra chilli flakes to my pizza as it adds extra zing to the whole experience of eating a hot slice of pizza. For drinks, I recommend the red ribbon mintt ginger dirnk. Anytime during the day in hot summer, it is my favorite drink. It also goes well with the pizza. 

I will go back again and if you are in southside with a bunch of friends or by yourself, you should consider visiting this place for a slice of the huge pizza they serve!!"}
