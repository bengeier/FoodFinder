{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend a few days ago for dinner and had a great time. The waiter for our table was super friendly and funny, and kindly helped me understand and figure out what to order from the menu. The food took maybe 30 minutes to arrive. It wasn't an overly long wait and we didn't mind, however the waiter and manager apologized and insisted on getting us some free dessert for our wait! Unfortunately we did not have time for dessert since the concert we were attended was going to start soon, however the waiter invited us to stop by after the show for dessert. We stopped by the restaurant after the show and got ourselves our promised dessert along with some tea and coffee. After our snack we went to pay for the drinks but were told not to worry about it by the staff! We honestly didn't mind the wait for the food because we enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant and the yummy bread, however the superb customer service and free dessert and drinks and friendly waiter made it a very enjoyable experience for the both of us. The food was good, however I think the taste is worth maybe 2/3 of the price charged. The service and atmosphere make up for it though."}
{"text":"Greeted promptly and courteously upon arrival to the restaurant where our waiter presented us the special Winterlicious Set Menu. Explanations and suggestions were clear and very enticing. Started off with the Mushroom Cappuccino Soup which was not visually appealing to the eyes but very flavourful to the tongue. As recommended by our waiter, i went with the Seared Rainbow Trout which was cooked to perfection! The skin was still crisp while the meat still held the juices and was tender (heavenly indeed!, it was like a party in my mouth). As for desserts, I had the French Apple Tart and Cinnamon - taste was okay but i could have done without the cold, hard tart. The timing of service was great where the wait was long enough to fully savour the food without drawn out delays between courses. Attentive service yet not invasive."}
{"text":"Braised lamb shank is very good. Entries' price is ok but they make money on the overpriced starters, wine, and deserts.   Bar service is not good at all.  Very expensive beer."}
{"text":"PARTIAL REVIEW  From the moment my sister and I had our coats checked to when we retrieved them at the door, we felt welcomed and well taken care of at Azure. The service is professional, yet personable, so it doesn't feel like you're dining in a stuffy hotel- definitely a plus for me.  We were spoiled with impeccable attention- our water glasses were consistently refilled, our cutlery replenished, and the meal moved at a comfortable and well timed pace (about 1  1/2 hours in and out).  This past December, the hotel welcomed Executive Chef, Shawn Whalen to the team to work alongside Chef de Cuisine Grace di Fede and General Manager, Stephen McGaw. The restaurant's food menu is very inviting and approachable- creative enough for a foodie, but familiar enough for a picky palate.  Expect to see a handful each of seasonal salads (like Niagara Poached Pear, $12-14)), elegant appetizers (including Scallops, local Beef Carpaccio, $9-14), Pastas and Risotto (mmm... like a beautiful sounding short rib tagliatelle, $21-25), and main courses from land and sea (Gamay Noir Lamb Shank? Yes please! $25-39).  One thing I especially love about the menu is that there are suggested wine pairings for every dish- a really nice touch for those looking to imbibe on a full-out foodie experience.  There are about 20 local and International wines by the glass ($10-28) and another 60 or so by the bottle ($40-1750). Their cocktail list of 11 offerings fuses trendy ingredients and classic recipes with a wide variety of house made syrups and purees going into each one.  My sister opted to start with a peppery Australian Shiraz ($14), while I went the cocktail route.  Pear & Vanilla Sparkler ($12) Vodka, Lime, Vanilla Pear Syrup  Mexican Screwdriver ($13) Tequila, Passion Fruit Puree, Jalapeno Ginger Syrup  Snowflake Martini ($14) Vodka, Elderflower Liqueur, Lime, White Cranberry  Three very different cocktails for potentially different palates or moods. The Sparkler was the mildest of the bunch - light, refreshing, but a little muted in flavour for this girl. In contrast, the Screwdriver was quite the kicker with the booze. It was smooth enough for those who like strong drinks, but I was expecting more fruit flavour from the puree and heat from the syrup, and I didn't really get either. The Snowflake was my far the best in my opinion. It was floral, refreshing and way too easy to drink- definitely my first go to next time.  For our Winterlicious dinner, we had a choice of 3 appetizers, 3 mains and 3 desserts, available for the reasonable cost of $45 plus tax.  Everything sounded delicious. It was so hard to choose, we ended trying all three desserts!    Parsnip Bisque Roasted Pears & Double Smoked Bacon  The creamy, smooth puree was complimented by the pieces of sweet supple pears and salty bacon at the bottom. This is such comfort food for February weather.  Dried Cranberry & Apple Salad Brie Cheese, Honeycomb, Almonds, Baby Greens & Sherry Vinaigrette  Yum, yum, yum. A nice balance of super tangy vinaigrette with sticky sweet honey and milky brie cheese. A lovely winter salad.  Ontario Grain Fed Veal Osso Bucco Potato Gnocchi, Root Vegetables, Kale & Gremolata  The gnocchi were light and pillowy and soaked up all the delicious meat juices that accumulated on the bottom of the plate. The meat was perfectly rendered and tender, but it could have been a little more moist.  Butternut Squash Risotto Arborio Rice, Mascarpone, Sage, Truffle Essence  Super creamy, luxurious, and cooked a perfect al dente. I did find it a touch overseasoned, and maybe would have appreciated some textural contrast (like bacon?), but that didn't stop me from wanting to finish the entire bowl. Azure has clearly mastered the allure of comfort food.  Café Mocha Chocolate Cake Almond Wafer   The cake itself was very moist, and the flavour was rich and pronounced with the coffee bringing out the subtleties of the chocolate.  I'm not a chocolate lover myself so this was my least favourite dessert of the three, but this might be a good pick for those who love that slightly bitter edge on their sweets.   Apple Caramel Cheesecake Calvados Sour Cream & Praline Crust  Best cheesecake ever. This was the absolute best part of the meal and I could have happily eaten two more of them and not felt a hint of guilt. The cheesecake was light and creamy, and the caramel was thick and luxurious. I also loved that in the middle there was a little piece of poached apple hidden inside. Order this dessert. Just do it.  Banana Walnut Ice Cream House Made Biscotti & Rum Toffee Sauce  The lightest and simplest of the three, but a very tasty offering for those who like banana- based desserts (me!!).  The ice cream was sweet and aromatic with a nice crunch from the nuts and an addictive sweetness from the sticky toffee sauce.."}
{"text":"Positively mediocre. High prices and bland food barely rescued by decent service. Convenient for guests and Convention Center visitors but otherwise many other better choices nearby."}
{"text":"Excellent service from staff!  Mohammed was amazing - professional and polite. Ran the hostess who helped organized did an amazing job and was so accommodating."}
{"text":"My colleague and I met up for breakfast. Between us, we had 2 cups of coffee; 2 glasses of orange juice; an order of hash; an order of oatmeal.   $66. Seriously?!?? How do you drop *that* check with a straight face?! I was staying in the hotel for business--so I wasn't even spending my own money. But prices like that are embarrassing.  The oatmeal was good. But please... not *that* good."}
{"text":"We attended for a Mothers day brunch which was excellent. This is a particularly nice spot during the day because the atrium features a ton of natural light - quite unique in that respect.  They did a very good job of making the occasion feel special with a large all you can eat buffet, chocolate fountain and yummy dessert table. Food was excellent and mom enjoyed herself thoroughly.  Not the cheapest but great for special occasions or a business lunch/dinner where you wanted to impress."}
{"text":"After a long walk through a  trade show at the convention centre, I just had brunch at Azure lounge at the Hotel Intercontinental. While the service was very pleasant I was disappointed in the meal. My 3 egg omelette was served over cooked and with that square sandwich bread that feels like foam and that you would expect at a truck stop.  Really?? While the price point was a modest $17, what you expect to pay for a downtown hotel restaurant, I was hoping for artisan bread and eggs less rubbery.   This international hotel does not accept debit cards. Even the waiter rolled his eyes at this inconvenience, I should have sprung for the Royal York. Is it any better there?"}
{"text":"A group of my girlfriends and I grabbed drinks here on a Sunday night. We chose this bar because it was very close to our hotel and one of the only bars opened at night.   Surprisingly, when we walked in, there were still a few patrons dining and a large group just starting to order seated close to us. Although it was late, we still received great service and our drinks were delicious! We were grateful to find a place so welcoming in the eleventh hour!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for appetizers and drinks for his birthday. It's more of a special occasion place for most since it was pretty pricey.  Drinks: The only word to describe their cocktails was strong. We ordered 4 different drinks and they didn't skimp on the alcohol on any of them, which is both good and bad because you don't end up tasting much of anything else. Their beer selection was okay. Not a lot of choices but mostly craft brews.  Apps: fairly good. Our oyster platter was really fresh, and at $18 for a half dozen, decently priced. Sliders were pretty alright. The pork belly was nice and fatty and dressed well. Beef sliders was disappointing as it just tasted like a miniature burger that had nothing special about it. The patty was good though, really moist and a nice texture to it. Chicken brochettes were delicious, but just a tad on the dry side.   Service: service was attentive, and not intrusive. They brought out a chocolate torte for my friend as it was his birthday, which was a nice touch.  Good ambience, which is what you pay for. Overall would recommend for a special occasion"}
{"text":"I was first made aware of Azure by the drop-dead gorgeous Chinese Maitre'D I saw in the summer of 2010 while staying at the InterContinental Toronto Centre, ever since I've been curious to visit, but the appropriate opportunity never came up.   I finally got the chance this year during the Toronto Sportsman's Show. The beautiful Maitre'D was nowhere to be found =[  A table for one at 9:00am, I ordered the Belgian wallfles.   I was seated at the middle of the restaurant with a view of the lobby rather the preferable view of the restaurant's backdrop.  To no fault of anyone because I did not specify where I wished to be seated, and I was alone which called for a smaller table.   The décor is very much open concept, and most of the space was enclosed in a window panel against Front Street, the windows rose many stories high allowing for natural sunlight, which is a very nice and rather important element for hotel restaurants in my opinion.  I felt that the carpeting and upholstery is slightly dated, and that is as much as I can complain about the décor because its not like they can change anything else.    My food arrived and I was surprised to see that my waffles were not actually Belgian.  Belgian waffles are characterized by their taller and larger size, and the ones on my plate were miniaturized.  Four mini waffles served with more butter and jam than I knew what to do with.  I was served a jug of coffee, which isn't unusual, what was unusual was the incredible smooth texture of it.  I've never had such delicious coffee in any hotel in Canada!  Not even in the other InterContinental hotels!  No creams or sugar needed, brilliant! But back to the waffles, I mean I was hungry and these things didn't look like they could do the job.  It was covered in pieces of strawberries, blueberries, and other fruits.  Check the photo album ^ It was okay, I wasn't too thrilled about the plate which it was served on, those long rectangular ones.  Those plates are meant for sushi aren't they?  It's difficult to discriminate the service because it's mostly the same in all the international hotels.  Very courteous staff, very attentive.   Supposedly Azure has live jazz in the evenings?  I never seen it passing by the hotel lobby a million times.  There's a full bar slightly sectioned off from the main dining floor.   It would be difficult to judge to give it four stars having come here only during breakfast, unless of course that Chinese girl showed up again..then I'd roll over sideways on any review website.  Need to update décor slightly, need to get the Maitre'D back."}
{"text":"I only had dinner at the hotel restaurant...although my hotel-mate ordered pizza from room service multiple times so maybe that's good. The dinner selections read more interesting than they tasted. I had the crab escabeche and the gnocchi.   The crab dish was OK...well balanced but the crab just wasn't that flavorful. But perhaps I am spoiled by the blue crabs of the gulf. The gnocchi could have been really good. The blue cheese was on point and the gnocchi was well made but then both were drowned in a really heavy creamy cheese sauce. The complimentary fresh bread was delish.  The staff was lovely and attentive but not pushy. They let me sit and enjoy a moment alone with my book. I also had a very tasty old fashioned."}
{"text":"I went there for a company event, and the food quality & services were way below my expectation !!! And I believe that this may still be truth.  http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/01/15/reality-didnt-always-match-the-menu-at-toronto-restaurant.html"}
{"text":"I gave it 4* but really it is a 3.5*. the food was good, the place was deadsville. We waited almost 5 minutes for the hostess to notice that we were there. I don't think it was our server but someone came over and offered us additional appetizers as our entrees were taking a while. which totally got them  .5*"}
{"text":"I had lunch with some colleagues and found he overall experience fairly average, food was probably a little below average while the service and wine selection a little above. There isn't really any reason why anyone would go here unless their already at the hotel."}
{"text":"Came for a late night snack. Best location for us because it's right below in the lobby of the hotel (Intercontinental hotel) which we stayed in. However, food is just so-so."}
{"text":"Comfy chairs, great live jazz, and delicious martinis. What else is there to say?"}
{"text":"The context: We arrange a small company/team holiday party in Azure's private dining room  Atmosphere/Décor : 4/5: Yes the outside of the hotel is looking a little older but you walk in and its open and high ceilings and has a city grand kind of feeling.  The restaurant also has such high glass ceilings that impressed many of our guests. As for the Private Dining area, the staff put up tasteful holiday wreaths and trees which was such a nice touch.  People are way too hard on the décor of this place.  Food 4/5: The group seemed happy with the meals.  I had the stilton skirt steak with truffle fries, my husband had the salmon on an Asian inspired slaw.  Steak skirt is a cheaper tougher cut of meat but it was pretty good considering.  The fries were super hot, crisp and tasty.  Salmon was a little on the dry side.  I enjoyed my banana fritters for dessert.   Service: 5/5:  I can't say enough about the service we received here.  First, since the restaurant is associated with an internationally recognized hotel chain, they have dedicated well trained staff for meetings and group events.  The first time I talk to the events coordinator, I knew the planning process would be a pleasant experience. Second the servers  and restaurant staff were exceptionally accommodating, which I absolutely appreciated.  They allowed us to stray from our planned schedule and push back dinner for an hour later because people were arriving late and just were having a great time cocktailing.  They were friendly and very professional.      Value: 4.5/5  The alcoholic drinks (beer and bar rail) were a little pricey - typical of hotels.  Overall the group menu had plenty of options which is very  important for planning events.   Other restaurants and venues at our price point would not offer such choice, along with exceptional service, it was great value.   Would we recommend Azure for your next group event - definitely yes Would we come back again for another private event- If our budget allows, yes"}
{"text":"Just landed and checked in for a convention, decided to hit the hotel restaurant because my 7 year old was getting hungry (and that means FIOD NOW!) Pleasant surprise to find a great truffled sherry mushroom soup, my wife enjoyed her hummus w crudités throughly and the staff was cool to improvise a Pizza Margherita that my son was craving... Very pleasant experience, great staff and prompt service."}
{"text":"We visited Azure for lunch during Winterlicious.   We were exhibiting at a conference in the convention center and were surprised to find that the restaurant was not at all busy during the lunch hour.  I suspect this is due in part to their service.  We waited at least 5 minutes to be seated.  No one appeared to be interested in seating our group of 6.  We ordered a bottle of wine and the server returned to the table nearly 10 minutes later to state they were out of this brand.  A man in our party attempted to order a glass of beer and the server seemed very unfamiliar with the beer they offered.   The saving grace was the food.  I ordered a delicious  (but small) squash soup and a chicken dish that was perfectly prepared.  A delicious caramel bread pudding topped off this Winterlicious menu.  Perhaps an \"off\" day for service.   We aren't certain because we rarely visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came to Azure during Summerlicious for dinner with my girlfriend, and had a great experience.  We ordered the Old Fashioned and Maple Manhattan to start, which were _extremely_ boozy. Now, I like me a stiff drink, but these were on the verge of being a little too much. However, I appreciate that the bar made us some crazy strong drinks, and that's a plus in my books.  To start, we chose the crab & sweet corn fritters and truiffle honey fig & prosciutto tartine. We were informed that the honey figs would be substituted for blackberries that evening, which was a slight disappointment but that was fine. The crab & sweet corn fritters had a great crab flavour and crispy exterior, and the sauce it came with was a fine balance to the fritters. The tartine had a delicious soft bread with the blackberries and prosciutto on top, quite a tasty way to start the meal.  For mains, we chose the pan seared pickerel and Dillon's rye BBQ glazed duck breast. The pan seared pickerel could have used a little more seasoning and a better sear on the skin-side for more crispiness, but the potato darphin really stole the show on that dish. The duck breast was tender, delicious, and very well cooked, and the salsa and wheat berry really complemented the dish well.  For desserts, we got lucky because our server saw our indecision with the desserts and graciously allowed us to have all three. The chocolate s'mores parfait was rich and very flavourful, and I really liked the graham crumble caramel. The peaches'n'cream cheesecake was light and refreshing, with great sour notes to complement the richness of the cheesecake. The limoncello cherry pie was very homey and comfortable, providing that great contrast between hot and cold elements with the pie and ice cream, and it tasted great.  Overall, our dinner at Azure was a very positive experience. Punctuated by the attention and care provided by our server Coco, I'd love to go back sometime and eat a regular meal there."}
{"text":"We caught some drinks here after a conference.    I was starving so I had the French onion soup, before deciding what else to have.   After the soup I decided not to try anything else and just have a few more drinks.  The soup was ok, not really fitting of a 4star restaurant.   The skylights were all frosted over with condensation, so the great view of the city lights wasn't really in view.     It's ok in a pinch, but there are many other better places within walking distance."}
{"text":"Good option for lunch, especially if you are attending an event at the convention center. I really enjoyed a revised version of a steak burrito without a tortilla. Cocktails are also good. Needs more options for mains."}
{"text":"I only went here for breakfast.  I was going to order off the menu because I am not usually a big fan of breakfast buffets.  The waitress urged me to get up and go look at it so I did and decided to eat there.  It was great.  I was impressed by the quality and freshness of their buffet.  There was a guy making omelets for you as well but I didn't even do that.  In comparison to the hotel where I was staying, this lounge was night and day.  Very luxurious feeling and good service."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place. We've been here 4 times and I haven't had a bad meal yet. The last time we were there was about a week ago. I like that that they have a kids menu and that my son actually ate the food! We're definitely going back. I LOVE their beef carpaccio and the crab cakes."}
{"text":"Thank you Dr. Kanner for hosting a party here. It was a fun time.  The drinks were on the light side for alcohol but I guess that means I should have a few more! Too bad the bartender got a little overwhelmed by our party of friends. It was so good to see my old friends from Residency again. We ate Samosas, Calamari, skewered chicken grilled were delicious. I love appetizers! Again, Thank you Dr. Kanner."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of hotel restaurants in the first place, and this one is one reason I am not. Food was mediocre, and the drinks were less than stellar. Service was lacking as well. Add to that the fact that everything was overpriced, I cannot recommend this place at all- there are much better places right outside the front doors..."}
{"text":"ArtBabe never gets to drink in swanky hotel bars in Buffalo. I'm a fan of swanky hotel bars. After Far Niente we plied our way through the underground to the Intercontinental Hotel and took a seat at the bar of Azure.   It's dark. It's blue. There are nice looking women bartenders. There are traveling biz people drinking alone.  ArtBabe gave a thumbs down to the Manhattan. She also tried the lychee cocktail after tasting the one I ordered at Far Niente. She thought Far Niente served up a better one.   Nothing much in terms of beer or beer on tap.   It is swanky though."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious lunch and was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting much as the reviews were not great and I find I usually don't enjoy summerlicious restaurants as much anymore. However, this restaurant was fabulous and had great portions. I had the Summer Tomato soup with Pernod shrimp salsa, the Marinated lightly seared pickerel , and the Strawberry tart with caramel tuile. They were all really good portions and very nicely flavoured. Service was excellent and fast. The restaurant was really empty though and it was filled with only 3 tables or so at the time we went."}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying at this hotel for our anniversary and had dinner at Azure.  We had reservations and were seated without any wait on a Saturday evening.  The restaurant was small with a trendy atmosphere and jazzy music.  The tables were very close to each other so that we could hear the conversations of the people around us.    Our waiter, I believe his name was William, was the nicest guy and always had a big smile on his face, but the service we received was incredibly slow.  We sat at our table for about 10 minutes before our drink order was taken and our bread basket was brought out very late.  We didn't get drink refills and waited forever for our food to arrive.  We noticed that all the tables around us had the same slow service but no one seemed to mind so we believe it was probably just that we (Americans) are accustomed to quick restaurant service.  I started with the crab cakes and having grown up in New Orleans, I know what a good crab cake is. They tasted more like tuna and were nothing special.  My husband had the Caesar salad and thought it was great.  We both had beef tenderloins as our entree and it was excellent.  I recommend this as it was very tender.  Unfortunately, I have to say the mashed potatoes tasted like instant potatoes and the vegetables were a disappointment.   I ordered the banana dessert that had banana flavored fritters and ice cream and was very tasty.  My husband had the maple dessert which was an apple crisp that he loved with ginger ice cream that he did not care for.    Overall, we had a nice dinner but probably wouldn't return unless we were staying in the hotel."}
{"text":"Nice place in the intercontinental hotel. Food is very good, but very pricey. Good serving staff."}
{"text":"(lunch at 12:45) Slow, slow, slow.  Got our drink order wrong.  Took half an hour for our food to be ordered.  Staff seem clueless that they are performing a customer service job.  Food was good but not great.  It was served quickly once we finally ordered.  Perhaps they were simply over busy but our waiter had little pep in his step.  Had no expression or consideration for our time.  The quick service upon ordering picked up most of our initial wait.  Had the service been better at the front end an easy 3 star maybe more.  I will give it another try and re-review if the experience is better."}
{"text":"Confession: I did not eat here. After viewing the menu and seeing $8 for HALF A GRAPEFRUIT (I kid you not) and $24 for a waffle (still not exaggerating), I decided to pass. Toronto has so much to offer when it comes to food, and for the same price as a waffle here, less than two blocks away, I was able to get a mocha, a glass of freshly squeezed OJ, a waffle with fresh fruit, and a side of bacon. I recommend renaming this place \"Scarlet\" as that will be the color of your balance statement if you choose to waste your money on the  sub-par food served at this shady establishment (see thestar.com's exposé on Azure falsifying their menu)!"}
{"text":"A hotel this nice (InterContinental Toronto Centre) should have a better restaurant.  I came home from a conference STARVED after an evening jog and was REALLY ready for a strip steak.  Poor quality, lukewarm, unseasoned, half-cooked vegetables.  The \"sweet potato mash\" is regular white potatoes with a little bit of sweet potato mixed in for color.  I called to complain and must say that the staff and management really took care of me and offered to comp the meal and give me another dinner on the house to try them again. For that, I increased the star rating."}
{"text":"Went on Winterlicious and the website made this place look great!  It was the more pricey menu and location great, then it all falls flat when you walk in. It look and feels like a empty hotel restaurant. Only 40% of the tables were filled. FOOD. It was good, nice presentation and taste, a little on the cool side. Service was weird!  We were interrupted about 5 times in heavy conversation from either the manager, waitstaff or a bussboy who got confused if it was his table or not.  The decor and feel of this place doesn't match the food. I would not return."}
{"text":"If you stay at the Intercontinental, be sure to add the breakfast for 2 to your reservation.  The best buffet I've had in years."}
{"text":"The Azure Restaurant and Grill is located inside the Intercontinental Hotel within the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. This is by far the most convenient sit down and \"relax\" type food establishment as the centre is surrounded by primarily food courts.   I had the opportunity to order a Caesar salad as a starter and a salmon dish for my main course. The salad was poor and lacked enough dressing and fresh lettuce. The salmon was dry and overdone. The sides, a mashed sweet potato, was cold in temperature. Not the best lunch offering.  The service was good and more importantly I enjoyed the ambiance. There is an incredible amount of natural light that streams through the glass adorned restaurant. This is the place to host a meeting or quiet lunch should you desire while attending an event at the Convention Centre.  Enjoy and good luck!"}
{"text":"28$ for breakfast buffet is kinda expensive specially when there is nothing special in the buffet. If you can, try any local restaurant around (there is plenty of them)"}
{"text":"I went last night and the place was closed with people sitting there and music playing.  OK, fine, they directed me to a nearby bar.  I went there Thursday night and the place had people and music and they told me that the place was closed, go to another F-ing bar.  (And I'm freaking Uranium Ultra-Ambassador status with this hotel...not to be a jerk but I stay here for expecations, lucky with my job for the perks for a poor person, so no arrogance intended.)    So tonight Saturday night the family is here, clients, I go to the Azure bar at 11:15 p.m. and I am told by the guy (with a cadre of folks at 40% of the tables and music playing) that we're union and if we don't get off at a certain time we can't catch public transit home and he said \"it's a $70 cab ride home\", end quote.  So essentially go to another (F-ing) bar that is NOT in Hotel Intercontinental.    Also, Hotel Intecontinental Toronto has NO elevators in the parking garage that they don't own.    Do not come to Azure day bar.  In college I worked midnight shift cleaning bathrooms on Chicago Toll Roads, daytime I worked at a department store as a stock boy, weekends my 3rd job as mowing lawns...tell these union F|_|cktards to get 3 jobs then and provide the customer with their glass of wine in their union hostage bar.  SAD.  ULTRA-friendly staff, sad parking and bar issues.  (And look, I'm #1 on 5 starring folks on Yelp, it just sucks being negative but truth-be-told here.)"}
{"text":"This was my second stop on the Summerlicious tour of 2012.  Lucky me, I was sent downtown for a few weeks to work in the summer time and I quickly tried to book as many lunch hour deals as I could.  This one was super easy to obtain and after dining there, I can see why.  The InterContinental hotel is fairly nice but there are places here that are starting to show it's age.  Though it is renovated and updated inside, the exterior is hard to keep up with the growing new swankier places nearby (Trump towers!).  When you move towards Azure, you're pretty much hit over the head with the actual colours.  It makes for an interesting environment as your meal does take on a blue undertone... most of the time it's not alarming until you get something yellow like a sliver of yellow pepper and then it starts to look greenish on the edges.    Service was genuinely pleasant and very personable.  He deserves 2 of the 3 stars for the review alone.  He was always quick and never rude... even when the other table near us were jerks (sorry, but why on earth would you have a phone conversation at the table while trying to order and then hold up a finger to the waiter to hush them is beyond me).  He handled all his table really professionally.  I wish more hotel restaurant staff was like him.  As for the food, ugh... I hope it was just a Summerlicious bad day because it was pretty rough.  I started with the smoked salmon rillette.  The idea sounded really tasty... smokey flavourful salmon that is cooked tender till it's like melt in your mouth.  In reality, it was really really salty.  Almost inedible.  I couldn't finish it after 2 bites.  My main was the short rib with root beer au jus.  Sweet and savoury pork would be amazing right... flavour was ok but the ribs were over done.  They weren't tender and if anything, I would say they were a bit skimpy on the meat as well.  It was disappointing.  I ended with the sorbet and it was ok.  It didn't blow me away but it didn't turn me off like my first two plates.  Overall, I wouldn't come back for the food at all but what saved my experience was the really great staff.  I would be willing to try it again ... but maybe after the smoked salmon salt lick experience goes away from memory."}
{"text":"Amazing. No words to say. Elegant and classes and with the best menu in Toronto . I enjoy so much."}
{"text":"I have gone to this places a few times, both with work and with family. I have only been there for lunch.  The time I have been with work was for a Christmas lunch where they had an AYCE. I will admit the food was really good. They had a salad bar which was fresh with lots of variety of cold foods. Their hot portion was really good too. They had mussels, and large cold shrimps, turkey, beef, potatoes, beans (to name a few), all of which tasted high quality. This AYCE lunch buffet is certainly not all year round, as I believe its only during the Christmas season.  The second time I went was a terrible experience. The food was good but the wait time and service was horrendous. There were 3 of us having lunch and after quite a long wait (probably 30 mins or so) only 2 of us got our food. The waiter said the 3rd dish would be coming out soon, but it didn't arrive until we had finish our food. Needless to say, person #3 was super mad and all they did as an apology was offer a glass of wine. To top it all off, I don't know how often live music is played there, but a jazz band set up and played music towards the end of the lunch, and it was so loud we couldn't even hear each other at the table.  Sometimes one really bad experience stops a person from going back to the restaurant despite how good the food is. This is one of those times."}
{"text":"Restaurants located in hotels tend to disappoint. Azure, located inside the InterContinental Hotel, has the look and feel of a nice place, but unfortunately the drinks, food, and service don't live up to first impressions.   Service in the lounge area is painfully slow. I waited over twenty minutes for my first cocktail, and even longer for the second. No apologies either time.   Breakfast is generally hard to mess up, but the poached eggs I was served had an off taste, as did the bacon. I could barely finish my meal, but still had to shell out about $35. (I know hotel restaurants are pricey, but $6 for a tiny glass of OJ?)  Since there are many other dining options in the area, I would recommend skipping Azure, unless you're on expense account and don't feel like leaving the hotel."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there for Summerlicious 2013 (this post is late, I know). And the food there was pretty good! The most memorable was the sweet corn and saffron bisque. If I'm ever in the neighbourhood, I'll definitely check the menu to see if anything intrigues me."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterdelicious 2011!!  Beef Carpaccio Mediterranean linguini (vegetarian) Pear tatin with candied ginger ice cream (vegetarian)  Was very happy with my selections. I particularly enjoyed the Beef Carpaccio and ginger ice cream. Nice place. Service is left to be desired."}
{"text":"My 2nd and last Summerlicious of the year was at Azure Restaurant & Bar located inside InterContinental Toronto Centre (@ICTorontoCentre) at Front and Simcoe.  Although  do like the natural light coming through the glass ceiling, I thought it was a bit dated with an 80's feel to it. But thought there's some small touches that can be done to update it a bit, like the blue water glasses and the blue vases should go.    On the other hand, Azure features contemporary Canadian cuisine by Chef Grace Di Fede who is an advocate for using local and seasonal ingredients.   Azure Caesar  ~ pepper infused vodka + Tabasco + Clamato juice + olives  Grapefruit Tree ~ vodka + fresh basil + fresh grapefruit juice + simple syrup  ~ Although the presentation doesn't say much, it's a rather large glass of cocktail compare to what you get at most places these days and it tasted very good. Simple but well made. I loved both of them a lot, the Caesar parked quite a bit of heat which I love while I am a sucker for basil cocktails... will probably try to replicate both at home ;)  Summerlicious Dinner at $45 pp ~ At first I thought the price was a bit high for summerlicious but in the end, it's all worth it with the yummy good quality ingredient and the rather large portion.  ~ Def no need of McDonald stop after =P  . Sweet Corn & Saffron Bisque (vegetarian) ~ Goat Cheese Crouton, Tarragon Oil  It was incredibly smooth with just light sweet corn flavor instead of the full on yellow overly sweet corn soup.  ~ This was a rather large portion but we had no problem licking the bowl clean =P   East Coast Crab Cake ~ Lemon & dill aioli, summer fruit salsa ~ With a thin crunchy shell, this crab cake was packed with lots of crab meat with minimal filler.   Canadian Farmed Beef Striploin ~ Rosemary & Garlic Potato Puree, Baby Vegetables, Chard, Pork Jus ~ I ordered mine rare but it came out medium well and the waiter seeing that I didn't really like it, immediately took it back and got me another one.  ~ And while waiting, he even came by to ask if I wanted a salad or anything while waiting (^_^)  ~ the 2nd one came back perfect and I enjoy every bit of it.   Pacific Organic Salmon ~ Orange & Shaved Fennel Slaw, Raisins, Pistachio, Asparagus, Pernod Tomato Puree ~ I usually don't like cook salmon at all but this was cook very well and the slaw and sauce goes perfectly together with the salmon.  ~ Everything on the dish just compliment each other so perfectly.   Bailey's Chocolate Torte ~ Vanilla Mousse, Summer Berry Compote ~ It sounded heavy, look and tasted decadent but was surprisingly light.   Ice-Wine Strawberry Panna Cotta ~ Fig Compote, Caramel Tuille ~ I am usually not a fan of panna cotta but this definitely won me over, especially love the fig compote.   Genoise Cake ~ sour cream mousse, doubled smoked candied bacon ~ This was not included in the Summerlicious menu but bought to us by our waiter.  ~ This was definitely sweeter than the previous 2 desserts but was offset by the saltiness of the bacon...  ~ Everything just taste better with bacon (^_^) ~ This dessert is now officially on their menu   Verdict : ~ Love the attentive service and was very impress with every dish ~ I haven't had such a great Licious experience for ages  Summerlicious have ended but they have extended their prix fixe lunch & dinner menu through August 31st.  *** This meal was complimentary. Opinions are my own***"}
{"text":"Considering the prices I would expect a server to know how to cut wine seal, pop cork and pour wine properly! Dishes were not cleaned off in sufficient time and for some odd reason other people's drinks were added to my tab despite me not the host of table nor with my permission! Overpriced for the quality of service! Waitresses unkept looking; hair and nails a mess not acceptable for this establishment nor for a breakfast truck stop!"}
