{"text":"Simply delicious. Being from California, I'm very particular when it comes to raw fish. This was super fresh and delicious. Highly recommend. Restaurant was very clean. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing hawaiian tuna her oml and their pozu sauce is heavenly.  They have boba here too"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place and I was not disappointed. The poke bowl was fresh and delicious and the service is amazing! The employees are super friendly. The only thing I didn't like is that the sauces are just poured on top of your base and protein. The poke place I normally go to mixes your toppings with the sauce and then they put it in the bowl. This adds more flavor to the toppings, but I will say there are more topping choices here! Will still be back to try the Boba!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Me and my wife go here all the time. I love that they have a punch card so you can get a free bowl. The staff is always super helpful, and makes great recommendations!"}
{"text":"Just notice this little gem in Litchfield Park. Finally there is a poke option for the southwest side of town.   The food was fresh and tasty. Portion was just right, lots of options on the poke bowl. They'll pack as much as they can into the bowl. He sushi is also fresh and good.   Price was a little under other poke places I've been to."}
{"text":"This is the first and closest poke restaurant to us living here in Goodyear.  I thought that the fish was fresh and service was quick.  While it isn't my favorite poke place that I have been to in the valley, it is still good and conveniently located.  I would recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Lucky is all we need to say in this part of town. Far too often we don't have anything worth talking about with friends regarding good spots in the west side, until now. Poke is all the craze, sure. But it's really yum and healthy. The product is very good and for being in the middle of the desert, it's fresh and tasty. I recommend you ask them for some suggestions if you are new to the game. Suggest a savory or sweet dish and go with it."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, I've had the poke bowl twice, portions are small compared to other poke places. Ingredients are fresh, but very limited."}
{"text":"Small, nothing fancy, but fresh, delicious, inexpensive sushi, rolls and Poke Bowls. BYOB. Best squid salad ever. Owned by a wonderful lady who practically invites you into her home."}
{"text":"Great first experience at this place. We've never been to a Poke Bowl place like this before so we weren't sure how it works. Luckily the lady was super helpful and patient with us as we tried some sauces and different protein options. I see some reviewers would like larger portion sizes and I would agree a little more for the money, but it was delicious and I was satisfied.  It may seem a tad on the expensive side, but remember we're not at a McD's or a fast food place, this is sushi/poke so keep that in mind when you go so you have expectations on the price."}
{"text":"Super fresh, delicious poke bowls.   Stumbled across this place, but will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Staff was very nice- clean environment- and the food was delicious- at a reasonable price!  Nice to have something fast and healthy!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time tonight and it was so good! The customer service was great. I was impressed with the quality of the food. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 5 times and I have always enjoyed the poke bowl and the sushi rolls! I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times now, and every time I go, it's such a good experience. The people who work there are so nice, clean and clearly experts on what they're working with.  First time I went here with a friend and we got their sushi, it took a little, but it was worth the wait. Their rolls was so, so good. And fresh. They were yummy.  Second time I went, I wanted to try a poke bowl. I've never had one, but I've always heard really good things about it. So I told the lady working I've never had one, so she helped me pick out what's good. I got to use salad and brown rice for my base, tofu and crab, sauces, etc, and it made me a very full but super satisfied customer.  Third time I went was with another friend who I also got a bowl with, and I tried their boba for the first time. It was delicious with the boba and the pineapple jellies. It's safe to say that this place is definitely worth it, the prices are great, and I love how close it is to my house!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad to have a poke place so close to home!!! Portions are ok, customer service could be better!   It is fresh and tasty - really good! Give it a try! You won't know if you don't go! (:"}
{"text":"Had a couple rolls everythubg was good . And the overall cast was very easy on my wallet .  Staff was helpful and chill to talk with..gave some tips on when yo come back to avoid the lines and others spots that had good poke..  over all really good experience"}
{"text":"We were looking for something fresh to eat after getting our nails done and stumbled on this delicious place! Ahí poki bowl was yummy! Spicy salmon and Hawaiin tuna are a must!"}
{"text":"Sister & i stopped by on their opening day and both had large poke bowls.  Initial thoughts? Customer service is great, Food is good and servings aren't too bad. My tiny complaint is that the crab salad is considered a protein instead of a topping and a large is only 3 scoops.  Overall thoughts? Better than ahi poki on 99th? YES! better than poke bar? Not quite. Will i be back? Yes, especially when they start selling boba :)."}
{"text":"Meh. This place just doesn't hold up to the quality of poke available in other cities or even other parts of town. Stopped for a bowl to go and left underwhelmed.   - Base: Asked for half brown/half greens. They were out of brown rice and the white was on the far side of dry. The greens were fresh, but I was only given a teeny handful, not what I was expecting. Sadly, they don't toss the greens with dressing like they do in other places.  - Protein: Fine, but not overly generous portions of fish. They don't toss the fish with sauce either, but rather squirt it on top so plan on mixing it around yourself. - Toppings: Nice that you can pick as many as you want, but the options are basic and they dish them out sparingly. I don't mind an up-charge for avocado, but honestly, the two cubes given were silly for a dollar.   For $15.82 (including tip) this isn't a place I'd return to, despite the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just had it's grand opening. Third time I've gone this month and it's just sooo dang  gooooood!  So it's setup like a salad bar, but for Poke and or Sushi!!! Kinda like \"How we roll sushi\" Quality fish, many meat options and great selection for sides. This place has me hooked!  Best part is i can easily eat for lunch as its quick for those of us at Luke AFB... Keep it up guys!  10% military disc"}
{"text":"I'm not a poke expert but I will say that this place is amazing. The price is very reasonable for the different types of seafood you can get. They have an really big selection and like I stated I'm inexperienced when it comes to making a poke bowl so I just grabbed everything spicy and made a meal out of it and it was extremely tasty and really fresh. It's such a variety that it is almost overwhelming next time I go I'm sure I'll get something completely different, they have everything from spicy Tuna salmon shrimp  spicy crab, to seaweed to numerous other toppings a regular bowl is only 8.95 it's healthy and it worth a try it's quick and much better than any sushi or poke you're gonna get out of a grocery store for lunch."}
{"text":"Driving home from work one day i noticed a sign saying \"now open \"  i was very eager to try  Sushi &poke house, and im very glad i did! This place has  great food for a great price of 8.95 a bowl. This bowl filled me up perfectly and   defiantly felt like I was back home in hawaii ,driving to the beach and going to foodland to pick up a poke bowl.  This place is only 5 miles away from Luke air force base and is  Definitely a great spot for lunch and a healthy alternative to other lunch places."}
{"text":"Should be called rice house... the scoops of protein are tiny!!!!! Even adding a third scoop for an additional $2 on top of the almost $9 bowl, there really wasn't much sushi and it was well over half a bowl of rice. Not to mention they show there is three different options: white rice, brown rice, or salad mix but they only had white rice. Also, I think they are afraid to let us taste their sauce. Just a little squeeze over the rice?! I want to taste it! I will be more likely to drive downtown to poké catcher off Thomas. I'm pretty disappointed and was hoping for a great poké bowl restaurant on the west side.  Although the Hawaiian tuna poke was tasty, everything else overpowered the fact that there was even any meat in the bowl.  I'll wait till they figure out appropriate portion sizes for the amount they are charging before returning."}
{"text":"My job orders out for our weekly meetings and we ordered here this week! We called in our order and it was easy! Food was ready in fifteen minutes. So happy they opened up! Everyone was really happy with what they ordered! I tried the tootsie roll and spicy salmon roll, both were SO good! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Finally a good place to fill my poke cravings.  Clean, fresh and priced Right.  Will definitely be returning. Even better that they serve Boba!"}
{"text":"Not great. We got a bowl each and ordered a roll each. The bowl was ok, small scoops of fishy but it tasted ok, maybe because the fish had sauce on it, but it tasted fine. The toppings are great, egg, kimchi, broccoli, just 3 of 12-15. But then the rolls came. Honestly the worst I've ever had. Tasteless fish, the sauces tasted weird. Bad, bad rolls. This place should just sell poke."}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband ordered the poke and I ordered sushi. It was perfect!! Poke just like from Hawaii!"}
{"text":"Decent poke bowls and boba, and it's nice to find a place that offers both! Their boba itself was good, however I found their matcha milk tea a little powdery tasting. Also, their poke bowls were on the smaller side, and they don't mix the greens with the sauce like all other places I've been to. I also wish they had flatter containers that would allow you to mix everything together, because since it was a little narrow it was difficult and I had to eat everything separately. Overall not bad, but I've had much better!"}
{"text":"I just tried this new place today. The staff is very friendly and the space is clean and well designed. The menu is made-to-order sushi and poke bowls as well as boba. I tried a roll and a few pieces of nigiri. The food was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Came in at 1120 on a Monday for my lunch take out. Had the Hawaiian tuna poke with imitation crab salad on greens with a dash of poke sauce. Not bad at all! I work at Luke and it's great to have more options besides the chain fast food restaurants nearby. I'll def want to come back and try other stuff out. It's not inexpensive, but is a nice alternative to what else is quick and available for lunch."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and well designed. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They even suggested we move tables to accomodate our party. I got a poke bowl and it was scrumptious."}
{"text":"It was adequate for what is advertised there. I just wish they would cut the avocados in half and when you choose to add them to your bowl scoop your portion into your bowl.. the avo is precut and it is mushy and browning due to air impact. It needs the protection of the avocado skin and that would create a better experience! Will go back"}
{"text":"I thought I'd check this place out after seeing the highly positive reviews here on Yelp. Unfortunately I wasn't particularly impressed with my experience. It wasn't bad but it wasn't the sort of lunch experience that would leave me wanting more. The Poke Bowl was fairly sparse in terms of the amount of Salmon and Tuna I received and the Salmon Nigiri I ordered was nothing to write home about. All in all there are better Sushi experiences to be had."}
