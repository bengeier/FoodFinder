{"text":"A pleasant surprise away from Little Italy. As a Suburbanite will be visiting and take out from here in the future."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner on a Sunday afternoon. One of us had eggplant parmigiana, two had pasta with seafood and one had crab stuffed shrimp 
Everyone loved their entree and the house salad as well. They make their own cheesecake and I have to say it's the best I've ever had including NY deli, fancy French and other upscale places. They usually have 3 kinds on the menu. Superb!  Great service, friendly staff, two nice dining rooms. Prices reasonable even for glasses of wine. Go there."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  I took a friend there; her response was: \"OH my, I think I have just had the best food I have ever had in my life!\"
I especially like the Tomato Basil Soup and the Steak salad; although the pasta dishes are superb also."}
{"text":"Great food, but horrendously slow service. I have been here twice and both times the service was painfully slow. Then at the end I had to wait over an hour for my check. I'd love to come back here, but I can't stand waiting 3 hours."}
{"text":"Okay Italian food at a more-expensive-than-usual price for the Twinsburg area. They use a lot of oil for the pasta dishes, but the dishes are good in my opinion for the dinner menu. Their risotto is pretty good, and same with their salads. The price is true main thing to consider, but the portions are rather large (usual portion size for Italian food, though). The service is slow for the quality of the food. 3/5 for the quality of the food, quantity, and slow service."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal, and have visted 10+ times.  The food quality, and service is commensurate with price or better....meaning I feel you get great value for your dollar spent.  From my experience, they are family friendly......with a kids menu, and you never feel like you brought your kids to a restaurant they shouldn't be at.  That being said, in my younger years I brought a girlfriend or two here..... this is a place to bring a date and have an adult meal too!  Great all around spot that surprises you considering the location."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  I had the chicken Marsala which usually comes breaded but I asked them to grill it and it was perfect. I chose the tomato and scallion risotto for my side. My husband had the salmon and crab. The salmon was topped with crab not a crab cake. Everything was cooked perfect and had so much flavor. The atmosphere was very nice. Easy to have a conversation even though there are a lot of tables. Must try!!! After reading Tammie E. Review I think she is more of the Olive Garden type. I mean of course there is balsamic in the oil. And they called it salad dressing???? Perhaps Olive Garden may be too upscale for them."}
{"text":"I love this place.  D'angelo's is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the area.  The atmosphere is quiet, and good for a date or a nice dinner with family.  The salads are awesome, don't mind the other reviewers.  My only let down on my last visit was that they don't carry gnocchi as a regular menu item anymore.  I used to get that with the breaded chicken strips on top.  It was fantastic.  
I highly recommend D'angelo's!"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant in Twinsburg. The food and service is top notch. The chicken penne al vodka is really good. The honey bourbon salmon with risotto is a must try. They also have homemade desserts.  The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"The salad is unbelievable... my wife and I have been coming to one location of the restaurants for two decades, wither in North Royalton, Macedonia or Twinsburg, and they always have great food.   But the salad.... amazing!   My wife is vegetarian but I'm a big meat eater but we both usually get the large salads."}
{"text":"I get takeout from this place a couple times per month.  They hit homerun after homerun.  You cannot go wrong with any of the pasta selections at this place.

Scallops, chicken, & veal.... fuhgetaboutit!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Italian restaurant in the area of Hudson. It is our go to place recommended by a friend. I usually order the Penne Vodka and my hubby mixes it up, but his fav is the spicy Cajun Cream Fettuccine. Must try it. I promise you will love the food. The service is hit or miss and that's why I gave it 4 stars. Yummy food though!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a coupon for \"buy one dinner and get a second of the same or lesser value for free\" with a tiny little note that said up to a $12 value.

Guess what? There is one - ONE - item on the dinner menu for $12.99 and everything else is $14.99 or above. So there was no way for you to get a second entree for free!!! What a crock of crap. I call BS on this place with that alone.

But we were there and we decided to eat. 

We had been seated in the bar area, I'm assuming because they saw my husband in dark blue jeans and when I checked, no one in the dining area appeared to be wearing jeans.

We ordered the full calamari for an appetizer. We both had \"mini\" dinner salads. He got the veal parm and I got the flat iron steak.

The waitress got blasted as all 4 tables were sat down in the bar at the same time, so she was hopping between tables and trying to do a good job, but a second helper soon came and was picking up the slack.

The drinks came (iced teas) and soon enough, the bread also showed up. The husband had been there before with a friend from work, and enjoyed dipping his bread in the oil. However, this time, he blanched and put it down. \"That's salad dressing.\" \"What?\" \"There's vinegar in that.\" And there was. Not enough to separate, but it did have balsamic vinegar in the dipping oil. He switched to butter. The bread was extremely fresh, though.

Our plate of calamari arrived. It had different types of peppers in it and at first, it seemed very flavorful. But it started to get soggy very quickly and the oil started to puddle a bit on the plate. I was using the white dipping sauce, which was good but had a solid black pepper kick that hit you in the back of the throat. The husband enjoyed dipping his in the marinara sauce.

Our salads came. The mini was actually in a salad bowl that was about 8 inches across. It was a lot of salad, but remember it adds $4+ to your dinner cost because salads aren't included in the very expensive dinner prices. The husband didn't like it because it was evident they soak their salads in the dressing and leave it there all evening, so the lettuce was limp. I'm from Youngstown originally, so after eating at Antone's my whole life, I like my lettuce like that on occasion.

Dinners came. The veal was a nice sized piece and had a side of penne. It was breaded, but the breading fell off while he was eating it. He said he liked the sauce. He didn't try the penne but he brought it home for his lunch for tomorrow. There wasn't enough cheese on top for his liking. 

I had the flat iron steak that comes with thinly sliced rosemary potatoes with 3 pieces of asparagus over a blue cheese sauce. I ordered the steak rare. It came out and was PERFECTLY cooked. Kudos for that. The red onion jam on top was flavorful. The potatoes were flavorful but most were mooshy. The blue cheese sauce was almost too much after a while. If I'd get this again, I'd get that on the side. The asparagus tips were good, but the stems were woody and gross.

We didn't do dessert. Our bill was $66 without the $12 coupon removed. It wasn't worth it. I don't think we'd go again for dinner. It was overpriced for the quality. He may go back for lunch, but not without a coupon or someone else paying."}
{"text":"I used to come here often when I lived in the falls and had missed it. I was in the area so I ordered take out. Got the house salad which used to be my fave! And some Cajun cream pasta. The salad had so much dressing on it it was instantly inedible, and I like A LOT of dressing usually. The pasta wasn't horrible just...odd. There wasn't really anything Cajun or cream about it. Very disappointing for a meal I barely touched..."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Food is good but you have to wait forever for every part of your meal, especially the checks!"}
{"text":"used to come here often, came here on 1/2 off gift certificate-left w/o even using it, didn't order enough food to cover cost-now I see why they are on 1/2 off sites. Outside the ashtrays were over loaded with butts. Waited in lobby (quite sloppy floors around host desk) over five minutes as no host-went inside and had to search for life.  Seated and served DIRTY glasses-actual lipstick on water glass-\"oh sorry, its dark didn't see\".  Got fresh glass, shortly after found that guests glass also dirty, asked for another and she said \"what was wrong with that one?\", really?? Ordered fried cheese and calamari-cheese not hot in middle and calamari plate was 60% peppers which had some crunch the calamari was soggy and lukewarm.  Ordered side fries and asked for mustard 3 times-never rec'd mustard.  So sad, was favorite place! Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Let down!

Decor was dark and outdated. It felt like a funeral parlor!  

There was one other table of diners there. We were sat.... and waited... and waited...  Finally our drink order was taken and we waited.....and waited... some more. 

I dont think the bread we received was truly homemade. The food itself was mediocre. The salad was not included with the meal and cost $5 extra. The Italian dressing was thick like mayonaise and tasted old. I' ve never been to an Italian resturant that mixes the sauce with the spaghetti before serving. I prefer to have the sauce on top and mix it myself. The pasta was dry and the sauce tasted like \"Ragu\".  The waitress forgot several items which was annoying for the price. Nothing stood out as being unique about this resturant and I would not go back."}
{"text":"We had a group event in one of the private rooms. The atmosphere is nice and the service was good. The food was terrible. The worst piece of lasagna I've ever eaten, filed with something they called sausage which tasted suspiciously like cardboard. The other entrees were spaghetti or chicken parm. I don't think anyone managed to finish their meal. There are much better choices for Italian food in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food !! Enjoyed the evening !! Great service !!  Wine selections were excellent !! The atmosphere is very cozy and fits in very well for a nice evening out !! Pasta dishes are excellently prepared !! Luved the dinning experience !! Would most definitely recommend this place !!

Thx

{"text":"I was a little nervous when we pulled up and saw the restaurant was in a strip of stores. However, all the food was very tasty and it had a nice atmosphere on in the inside."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner, mini salads, Veal Romano, Eggplant Parmigiana, Chicken Caprese and Spaghetti Marinara were all excellent with large portions and excellent bread. Service was also excellent. One of the best Italian Restaurant in area. Reasonable prices. All in our party enjoyed dinner very much."}
{"text":"I used to come here quite a bit on my lunch break because it was quick and easy. I took a few months off from here and I decided to do lunch today and the service was slower than I remembered. Usually I came in and got a salad, pasta, and a cup of soup in well under an hour. Today it took an hour to get ONLY the soup and salad out. I couldn't even stay there to eat my pasta, had to get it to go and have to heat it up and eat later. The salad was uneatable because the dressing was on it and became soggy..Didn't even get a sorry from the waitress about it.... The menu changed a bit so I wonder if something else changed?"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place because we were near and heard good things. we got there and it was in a \"strip mall\" setting. Dont let that stop you. The minute you walk in its another world.  The staff is friendly and make you feel like family . The dinning room is fancy yet casual and comfortable. Now the food. OMG! Why go downtown to little Italy. They do it better. the bread and dipping oil is a must. Kate knew exactly what wine i wanted. It was excellent I had the Chicken Palermo. It was cooked and seasoned to perfection. My husband had the Melanzane Parmigiana-Eggplant. Wow. it was breaded eggplant stacked which kept it crispy.And for desert a special mint cheesecake to die for! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Another delicious Easter buffet at D Angelos.  It was quite the spread once again. What also makes it nice, is spending money at an establishment where the owner and staff are so accommodating.  Just good people. 
Now, if you go on a regular non-holiday, May I suggest the veal Parmesan w risotto.  As good as any restaurant in Little Italy in my opinion.  And the house salad is my favorite of any place I go, especially with the Italian bread and oil/vinegar/cheese served with it. Yum."}
{"text":"My husband and I met some friends here for dinner Saturday evening.  It was our first time dining here and we were excited about the Italian food.  We were not disappointed!

Although the restaurant is located in a plaza there is plenty of ambience!  Dim lighting, hushed conversations, candlelight and beautiful place settings pleasantly surprised me when we arrived.  

I know other reviewers described the service as \"slow\" however I found our server to be thoughtful.  She waited at the table until our conversations had stopped so she wouldn't interrupt us.  She was at hand when we needed something but was not like a vulture.  The low lighting added to the romantic mood and the measured service set the tone for a two-hour meal enjoyed by friends.

The parmesan crusted diver scallops that we had as an appetizer were fresh with a crisp carmelized outside and plump sweet flesh.  The bread was hot, delicious and plentiful.  We ordered an Amitage red blend wine that was unique to find on a menu AND reasonably priced.  Delicious!

I ordered the seafood linguini with garlic and oil sauce while my husband ordered the lasagna.  I haven't had sauce like this since my friends from Italy owned a little intimate restaurant in Akron - I didn't think I would ever find this type of sauce again!  Everything tasted homemade and our entire party loved their meals.

For dessert we had cannoli and pistaschio gelatto - wonderful!

We will definitely be back for dinner.  So many of these beautiful restaurants are disappearing in the wake of cafeteria-style lighting, drive-thru-type quick service, and \"give me free food\" attitudes."}
{"text":"I grew up in Twinsburg and this was always my favorite restaurant in the area. It still is.

I could order in my sleep:
House salad and veal parmesan with risotto.

Let me break down the whole meal in order.

First, the fresh bread arrives. It comes with some Romano cheese and a saucer of oil, balsamic vinegar, and Italian seasonings. I spoon a few spoonfuls of the oil and vinegar (careful to make sure you get vinegar in each spoonful) onto my plate and pour a generous amount of Romano cheese onto it. Mixing that should emulsify the oil in the vinegar quite well, now that the small cheese particles are there to help. Then dip the fresh bread in that and enjoy. 

Next, the salad is my favorite side salad anywhere. Its a tossed salad. The amount of dressing is perfect. The fact that the lettuce has been in the dressing for a bit has just begun to soften the lettuce. I've tried to replicate this salad and cannot. Idk if it's the temperature or the toppings or the dressing, but it's great.

The veal parmesan is always delicious and I've never had a bad risotto. They have a very good red sauce. 

Whenever I'm visiting family in Twinsburg I try to make my way to D'Angelo's."}
{"text":"They have updated the decor and the menu. Thumbs up to both moves, the place was getting VERY dated on both counts. The menu now has lighter options than the old school pasta a red sauce heavy menu of the past. That kind food is still available, but enhanced by some new ideas. The location is convenient for the Western Reserve Diner (south east burbs) off of 91 right near the Hudson, Twinsburg border. Fun fact, the only Burg in the US with an h added is Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food, for a very reasonable price.  We've been here over 20x in the past 2 years, and it is always good.  The D'Angelos salad is an excellent start.  All the entrees are delicious.  The service is typically good.  The only thing keeping it from a 5 star is the wine list isn't that impressive, and the atmosphere in the Dining Room is just okay.  Try it - you will be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"We decided to try D'angelo's as it's just up the road from our house and it's a locally owned business which we like to support.

The restaurant is located in a strip mall but the food certainly doesn't reflect it.  The interior is nicely decorated and painted in nice soft earth tones.  The lighting is low but bright enough to see what you need to.

The waitress greeted us and we looked over the wine list.  The bottle prices are very reasonable but we ended up just having a couple glasses of a nice Super Tuscan.  

The waitress brought a nice hearty Italian loaf and olive oil with a little balsamic vinegar for dipping.  Very tasty.

We chose risotto and lobster balls and calamari as appetizers.  The risotto balls were nicely crisp on the outside and quite tasty.  There were five of them and they were large so be aware.  

The calamari was good and came with a dipping sauce and lemon wedges.  Very tasty.

We split a Greek style salad which was fresh and crisp.

My wife had the pasta bolognese and I had the grilled shrimp skewers with risotto.  Both were excellent and the portions were large enough that we both had lunch the next day.

We were so stuffed that we took a dessert to go.  It was a layered chocolate mousse cake and was very, very good...even at 11pm!

Overall we were extremely pleased with the food, service and atmosphere.  We'll be back to D'angelo's soon for another meal.  I think I'll try the ravioli next time.

{"text":"This is a fantastic place to eat.... Wedding soup / sausage stuffed peppers and finally pasta special were fantastic... Staff were engaging,,, and place has a great atmosphere......we also had a nice bottle of wine,,, and was pleasantly surprised at how reasonable the bill was... Would definitely recommend,,, and will certainly go back....."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing.  Good atmosphere.   Great food!  We had Chicken Parmigian and Tortellini with blackened chicken.  Both excellent.   Our server, Madison, was attentive and friendly.  Will definitely return one day."}
{"text":"Made the trip for 15 member family gathering, seated in the bar area with our reservation.  

Drinks menu was decent, got a malbec which was quite good, a few italian and other beers, nothing too surprising.  Complimentary warm fresh bread was a highlight - we were hungry!

Bruschetta was middling.  Of the 4 pieces, 3 were crispy and soft, almost perfect, but one was soggy from tomatoes.  The house salad was very good and nice that there were 3 size options.  Linguine tutto marre ringed by mussels when it arrived, had a nice flavor with mushroom and light garlic sauce, but skimped a bit on the quantity of seafood.  Porcini and truffle cappellacci (mushroom stuffed raviolis) were tasty.  But both entrees were heavy on the salt, pushing our boundaries as salt-lovers.  Passed on dessert but did taste test the chocolate cake, which was huge and good enough.  

Around the table the portions were gigantic; there was plenty to take home.  The service was attentive, thoughtful, and friendly.  The atmosphere sitting in the bar was festive but allowed us to still talk to one another without shouting.  It was a nice night; having higher quality food and more creative options would have made it nicer.  This was a solid dining experience but nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"We came here almost by accident, as the restaurant we had originally intended to go to was closed for the day.  This place is a treasure - a nice combination of old Italian with modern touches.  And dinner was magnificent.  My wife had Penne Vodka and both our guest and I had lasagna - all were among the best we've had lately.  And the cheesecake is a must, although we were full enough from dinner to require boxes for both leftover entrees and for dessert.  Unfortunately, we're not from the area and probably won't be back anytime soon, but we'll be sure to check this one out should we return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came here for a wedding reception. The bride and groom had chosen five things for the menu to choose from. Amongst the choices were lasagna, chicken parmesan and Cajun Cream Fettucine. I don't remember the other two menu items. All of the entrees came with a salad and bread.

I usually don't particularly like oil or vinegar-based dressing on my salad, but this dressing wasn't bad. The bride and groom did say they had requested the kitchen to go light with the dressing and they did. 

I chose the Cajun Cream Fettucine. I did not regret this decision.  It had grilled chicken, white onions and Italian sausage. The cajun cream sauce was perfect and not overwhelming and the chicken and Italian sausage were delicious. I absolutely loved this dish. It was a big serving and very filling. I had to get a to go box but unfortunately did not get to enjoy it later as the hotel had refrigerator problems, so that was a bummer. 

My boyfriend had the chicken parmesan. I tried it and it was good. Not as good as my food, though!  My Chardonnay was nice and chilled and my boyfriend's beer seemed appropriately cold. 

I see some reviews complaining that the restaurant is in a strip mall. I really don't see the problem. It's not a trashy strip mall and the outside looked fine. People also complain that the décor is outdated. I don't know about that, but I liked the décor a lot. The restroom was even pretty. I thought the light fixtures in our dining area were very pretty. I think this place would be great for a nice date."}
{"text":"As a downtown dweller, D'Angelo's was a complete surprise to me. I like Twinsburg, but when I think of the area, I don't necessarily associate it with chic restaurants. This is a strip mall secret with the ambiance and fare of a buzzing city restaurant.

For starters, I adore the interior. Boldly colored walls, cool chandeliers, giant vintage photos of their family and nice art adorn the walls. You walk in and immediately feel a good vibe. The restaurant is also deceivingly huge - it takes up several giant rooms. They also have a nice party room with closeable doors that's a perfect spot for parties or celebrations.

Another pleasant surprise was the cocktail menu. Wow! They have a skilled bartender that knows what they are doing. We had a White Lightening (cream, Kahlua, Amaretto, chocolate) that was so dreamy and went down way too easy. I could've had several. For dinner, I had the Tutti de Mare, which is a dish I may not normally order, but am so glad I did! The noodles had a thick, garlicky flavor and the mussels and clams were HUGE and beautiful. It was a substantial amount of food and I was so stuffed afterward. It had a beautiful presentation and I would for sure order it again to satisfy a seafood craving. I also thought the prices were reasonable all around. Overall, this spot is an unexpecting, unassuming suburban secret (to me at least) with delicious Italian food and great cocktails. I'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"First time at D'Angelo's in Twinsburg (I gather that they are related to Casa D'Angelo in Macedonia, which we always like).

Everything was great.  I had the tortellini with grilled chicken (in a very nice pink sauce) and my wife had the scallops with risotto.  The scallops were very slightly salty, but tender and tasty and the risotto was excellent.  Nice piece of tiramisu for dessert.  Had a $12 off coupon, so with two coffees and a glass of wine it was $57.  Not cheap, but the food was very good.

Very good service too and a very friendly waitress.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our second time there. Clean, nice restaurant.  My wife enjoyed the Melazane (eggplant) Parmagiana, I loved the Chicken Palermo, and we shared a bottle of Hogue Riesling,  My wife's daughter  liked the Tortellini Tomato Pesto.  The waitress, Angela, was very knowledgeable and friendly.  She brought fresh, delicious bread.  Great atmosphere.  Good sized-portions.  My wife's favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food/atmosphere at D'Angelo's. Despite being in a plaza, a location which I often associate with classlessness and a \"quick bite to eat\" mentality, the restaurant redeemed itself in every facet. Ambience was inviting, despite slightly tacky decor. The space was large - we were seated in the back room and there were no other parties around us. However, the front tables did seem quite crowded together.

The service was quite excellent, and a significant reason why D'Angelo's warrants a 4-star rating. When I ate here, I was with a party of ten (three of whom were under the age of ten). Our waitress was patient, accommodating, and never seemed to get frustrated with our overwhelming table/the antics of the youth. 

I definitely over-ate during the appetizer portion of the meal, but I couldn't exactly say no to well-prepared calamari, fried risotto, and mozzarella sticks. That said, I didn't really have the stomach to make a fair assessment on my entree (which was penne ala vodka, if my memory serves me correctly). It was fine, well-cooked and a large portion, but other than that, not memorable. While I don't intend to eat here again, as I'm not often in the area, D'Angelo's is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Just recently moved to the Hudson/Twinsburg area and I'm genuinely scared this restaurant is now less than a mile away, because it's so darn good. My mom and I got take out and it was phenomenal. The tomato pesto tortellini was delicious, especially with the blackened chicken-full of flavor. My mom got the pink vodka shrimp penne pasta and it was excellent. I will be back!

The lady on the phone who took our carry out order, was also very pleasant!"}
{"text":"Quaint and a little underwhelming on the decor.  But the food is great and service is good.  Worth the visit and the price.  Arguably the best top end restaurant in Twinsburg."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars. The Decor was romantic. Great for a date. But I was there with my mom.  So I was not looking for that. We were sat.... and waited... and waited... and waited.....and waited... no server... no water... no drinks.. Someone said something quickly as they walked by... We waited and waited.. Eventually the guy who sat us who I assume was one of the managers maybe even the owner... said has anyone been to see you yet? NO. Hold on.

Eventually she did show up with the excuse that another server did not show so she was overwhelmed.

Yeah I don't care. I want to be in the restaurant business and in any business your going to have times when people do not show up. You cannot use that as an excuse to justify slow service to the waiter. The mark of a good team and a good staff is one that can band together to cover the slack of a missing team mate. The customer should never know you are a man down. 


By the time she finally came to our table the table that was sat after ours was already giving their drink/appetizer order.

The bread we got was a couple of slices from what I honestly have to doubt was truly homemade. The food itself was mediocre. I honestly could have probably made better pasta at home using prego. I am sorry but it is true. Nothing stood out as being unique about it.

Apparently this place is different from the one that is located in Macedonia. 

I hope so.I am sorry I just cannot support a place that has this poor service. Call-offs happen, people walk-out, people quit...If your not prepared you shouldn't be in the service industry.


A restaurant is so hard to succeed in. Not only do you need to have good food but also good service. The two things that are genuinely hard to succeed at."}
{"text":"Great food,  oversized portions!  My parents had my rehearsal dinner here and of my friends raved about the food. They also had enough leftover for lunch the next day. Can't wait to go back. The staff was very accommodating as well!"}
{"text":"This is a probably non a restaraunt. I could call it very low quality fast food ever! If that restaraunt belongs or some way links to the real Italians, those guys should be really shame to mention it somebody!!! If you want to know what the real Italian cuisine not looks like you can visit it. Otherwise never visit it!!!"}
{"text":"So so so so good!

I have been here many times for birthdays, family dinners, regular during the week dinners and recently for a private event. 

By far my favorite thing is the garlic parmesan mushroom fettuccine. It is like gods gift to pasta. And I have two Italian grandmothers, so I'm telling you good stuff.

Have had many things on their menu and all are good. Veal, chicken parm, spicy sausage pasta, rigatoni..etc. the list goes on. All good.

Here's a little secret and the icing on the cake literally. Their cheesecake is made from scratch in house and is out of this world. Probably the best cheesecake I've ever had. Don't believe me try it and tell me different ;)"}
{"text":"Wonderful rich Italian food. Your stomach will come up and kiss your mouth.  Rat pack jazz, attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"Yum. So good. We stopped on our trip from NYC to Michigan and I'm so glad we did! Pasta was so rich and creamy. Bread was good. Salad was great. Would definitely go again if we have the chance."}
{"text":"It was OK, but nothing to write home about. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing (both had lasagne) or perhaps my expectations were too high based on the other reviews.  Menu selection seemed limited and pricey as well for the area (maybe because it's close to Hudson). The lasagna was $17 each and didn't come with anything except bread. The portion was generous, almost too big.  Personally, a nice side salad and a smaller entree portion would have been better. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at D'Angelo's and I'll give you the good news first; it's a clean place with a friendly staff.  Bruschetta app was great, soup was good, bread and olive oil was nice, eggplant parmesan was killer.  
     Then I got my entree, raspberry glazed scallops with spinach risotto.  But before I got my entree, I smelled my entree, even before it got to my table, I got a strong odor of bad fish.  And it only intensified as the waitress got closer.  Scallops shouldn't smell like fish.  The plating was just as bad.  It looked like a joke; if I wasn't nauseated from the odor of fish, I probably would have laughed out loud.  The risotto was in a mound of solid starch; way undercooked and didn't even have any spinach in it.  And the raspberry glaze was actually raspberry syrup saturated over everything.  And here's one last thing.  The scallops had no color on them whatsoever.  No grill marks, no sear, no nothing.  Like they were boiled? Microwaved?  By far the Worst meal I have ever been served In My Entire Life.  
     I obviously sent it back and the staff handled it perfectly.  Great job.  Didn't give me any attitude, seemed genuinely apologetic and didn't charge.  Because of the staff and the app and eggplant, I would actually go back, but not any time soon."}
