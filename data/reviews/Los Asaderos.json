{"text":"Best Mexican food we've had in Mesa. Hands down! Nothing else compares. Everything is made fresh to order, the prices are low, and everyone is nice and the place is super clean. Always our go-to for Mexican food now!"}
{"text":"Los Asaderos has delicious tacos! And delicious salsa!! First time in and I'm sold!!! Very good customer service and very clean too!  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Los Asaderos is a great place I just moved here from Los Angeles and over there the Mexican food is so good and there is no where in the states that can compare but this place Los Asaderos gave some of the Mexican places in cali a run for there money and I'm also big on customer service when I came in I was greeted by karla and the cook and I was asked a couple times if everything was ok, so if you want great food this is the place to come and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"You have to have some low expectation and standards to leave this place anything higher than a 1 star review. Their horchata tastes like aspirin, the carne Assad's has more bone, fat and cartilage than actual meat. I kid you not, of very 6 pieces of fat and cartilage, there was 2 piece of actual meat. It was disgusting. Paid over $25 for tacos and a quesadilla and it all went in the trash."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim several weeks ago. The staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered the folded tacos consisting of a spicy shredded chicken with full dress consisting of onions and cilantro that were very flavorful. We also ordered the Chicken torta \"empanizada\" that included lettuce, tomato, cheese, avocado, chipotle sauce and a thin layer of refried beans. The restaurant looks to have been remodeled and is very clean. They have a self-serve salsa bar which also had a great variety. Shout-out to \"Chuy\" the cook for being so great at providing the recommendations on such a large menu. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow this place has great tacos!   I've tried the shredded beef and chicken and they are both delicious.  I do like the chicken slightly more because of it's spicy flavor.    The salas they offer are all homemade and vary in how hot they are.  The salsa verde is super.  Authentic Mexican food with really friendly staff.    Stop by and check this place out - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place, my wife and I have been twice already. First time we split a steak burrito and horchata. Second visit I got Al Pastor with rice and beans and the wife got a steak burrito again. The food is authentic and delicious.  Pros:  Tortillas taste like nana makes them Burritos are huge and include beans and rice Their salsas and condiments are made in house and  are tasty  Cons: Service is friendly but above average wait time A tad pricey  They scorched the tortillas on my child's quesadilla   Overall, a great Mexican takeout joint. If you haven't been, give them a shot. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is ahhhhmazing! When I walked in the doors, I was promptly greeted with smiling faces. They asked if I had been here before and I told them no! They then introduced me to every meat they had and offered me a sample. I eat a lot of mexican food so I picked cabeza! My husband had 4 tacos de cabeza. I had the biggest Huarache I have ever seen and I also ordered a quesadilla plate for my youngest. I did get Carne asada fries too for a very decent price! The cabeza is hands down the best cabeza I have ever had! It was soft but not runny and salted perfectly. The carne asada was chopped perfectly and flavored divinely. Prices are standard but food is delicious!  This place is definitely going to be our new to go place! I forgot I did buy a carne asada burrito to go! That burrito hands down is the biggest and tastiest burrito we have ever eaten. The tacos are made completely from scratch! We got to watch the tortilla cook on the comal! I urge you to try this hidden gem out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife found this Mexican restaurant a month ago. She bought a variety of the food ordered and brought it home.  I was impressed!  The other day she sent me. I walked in to a very clean and welcoming restaurant. I approached the counter to be met with the owner (like a dumb ass, I didn't get her name).! She was the most friendly and hospital host I have met in a long time! Anything I wasn't familiar with, she offered a sample of and a detailed explanation of.  I am soo glad this is only half a mile from my house! Great food and hospitality and service beyond better!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had much higher ratings than I'm giving it. I went there because of the high ratings and so my anticipation level was quite high for my experience. I ordered the two tacos combination plate with rice and beans, and I also had the shredded beef tacos. The atmosphere is that it's the middle of the dinner rush and I was the only one of two customers in the restaurant. I think they need to think through how to bring customers in as they're right next to a bus stop and they could hire somebody to stand out every 15 minutes when the bus arrives to hand out flyers about specials their running to attract customers into the business. I don't know that the high ratings that they have for their tacos holds much weight as the tacos that I had were corn tortillas and fell apart when I ate them. I literally had to turn my tacos upside down to control the contents so that it wouldn't spill all over my plate. Now for the good part, their food is really quite delicious. They are new business so they have a lot of kinks to work out of their processes, but when they do they're going to be a contender and before they become a contender why don't you give them a try because they're worthwhile and they could use the business. I'd like to see them be highly successful in the next several years and I think they have an opportunity to do it here. So with the three star rating, I would say you'll probably find between three and four stars when lots of people start showing up to eat here because the food really is good, so enjoy it soon."}
{"text":"Best shrimp tacos Ever... Staff was very cool.  Even gave me a little taste of some special tacos they were making."}
{"text":"1st time in.  We tried many things.  All were good.  I recommend the red chicken taco or burrito."}
{"text":"Good find!  Great tasting food and very clean place.     Food takes a little long to get but it's def worth the wait.  The tortillas are freshly made(yummy!), expect your taco to be bomb:)  I ordered the carne asada plate, with is served with side salad, rice, beans and a good amount of meat.  Meat  was tendered and flavorful, and of course th fresh tortillas was a bonus.  Prices are seasonable, 18.99 for two, including two bottles of water."}
