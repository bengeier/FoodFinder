{"text":"What a hidden gem! Was looking for a good hot pot place and I've definitely found it! Our meal came to $30/person with the all you can eat style plus a double soup base for one of our pots.   The portions were large and the food tasted really fresh! Strongly suggest the pork bone soup base if you would like to try a specific soup base. The location was modern and very clean. Acoustics were also pretty good for a place with mostly hard services.   The service was excellent! Staff were courteous and friendly and available to help as needed. You even get a little stamp card to get a free meal for one person after 7 meals!   This has become my new favourite hot pot place, so glad I found it!"}
{"text":"Good price, good food, the only thing which makes it imperfect is that the space of this restaurant is small and it's better to make a reservation before going, or you may have to wait for long time."}
{"text":"Food quality is so so. Most are frozen not that fresh. We ordered more vege before we finished first round. The waiter came to us to suggest politely we'd better not to waste food. After that, we never got our order. And we also didn't wanna bother to have more. I guess this is the only time we go."}
{"text":"Ingredients were very fresh, especially the good selection of veggies. Beef slices and seafood were of good quality. We ordered the spicy broth and the tomato broth. Both were flavorful. The veggies cooked in tomato broth was heavenly.....hmmmm....the spicy broth was good for cooking meat slices. Service was good, and the place was pretty clean. It was also well ventilated so there wasn't steam everywhere. Would be back!"}
{"text":"Best hotpot restaurant in Toronto! Good services and fresh ingredients!! We will come again!!"}
{"text":"My first experience was so great here. Fresh food, especially shrimps and beef slices. The waitress was polite and friendly. It's definitely better than other hot pot chains in Toronto which are famous but have bad quality."}
{"text":"We had 9 people come together on the weekend Friday night and it was packed! Make sure you make a reservation ahead of time. We were there from 6:30-10 and there was a line up the whole time.  The food was good, really fresh ingredients and the soup bases were great. Our group had 2 pots so we tried a couple bases. The portions seem a bit hard to order.... Whether we ordered 1 or 3 portions of meat, the same amount came out lol, near the end we ordered one portion of lamb but it was towering..  The service is a little slow because they only have 2-3 servers. However, hot pot is a slow meal so I personally didn't mind that much. I would recommend this place based on my experience.  BTW, it's cash or debit only. They can split bills."}
{"text":"Super like their spicy hot pot ????  All meat and vegetables are fresh. Service is good. Highly recommend to go there."}
{"text":"A hidden gem located inside of Parkway Forest Plaza! They recently opened not too long ago and I would say that I was content with everything they had to offer. All the meat was extremely fresh and tasty, and the veggies were also very fresh as well. This menu has a lot of variety ranging from different soup bases, carbs, meats, and veggies. Dessert only had vanilla, red bean, and green tea ice cream.  Unfortunately they charge $1.50 each for every dipping sauce there is, and I usually like to mix my sauces. They also have Japanese Kobi beef which is $12.99 but being the cheap person I wasn't able to try it.   The service was great too! Each staff member was very friendly and responsive whenever we needed something, and never missed out on greeting us from the moment we came in and up until we left.   The only thing I would say was a bother is the lack of ventilation, where I found myself finding difficulty to breathe. The total for each person came out to be $31.26 including tax, assuming the weekend prices differ from weekday prices."}
{"text":"This place doesn't have a lot of selection of meats and veggies that other hot pot places have, but it makes up for this with kick-ass broth, quality ingredients and homemade sauces.   Also the fried man tou tastes like a cloud.   This place definitely lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"My experience with Hot Pot has been limited at best I can admit There are so few opportunities, save for those blustery Canadian winter days where it truly feels appropriate. Plus it's an effort for a white guy like me to find a group of pals eager to venture outside their comfort zone. Korean BBQ is about as far as it's gone in past.  That being said, when I do get the chance I savour every minute and every bubbly hot dish that comes out - and let me tell you, I always make sure that since it's all \"I\" can eat, there are plenty of dishes. the night usually ends with me groaning, and making deals with any god that will listen that I'll never eat that much again. The other downside typically is that because everything is cooked in the same broth it all ends up tasting the same which is the only thing that stops me.  Enter, Beijing style hot pot, a whole new adventure to the depths of flavour country. Unlike it's more commonly found counterpart the Beijing style is server in an ornate copper pot (better for conducting heat) and the broth (if you're sticking to the rules) is not much more than water and a few staple herbs and staple ingredients. The result, perfectly and quickly cooked food that allows the natural flavours and quality to do all the talking (instead of masking it with tons of spices and ingredients).  Best of all, the piles, and I'm talking tiny mountains, of freshly cut lamb are never ending and always the star of any visit.   My recent visit to the appropriately named Beijing Hot Pot Restaurant, located just a few blocks from Fairview Mall in North York was a re-awakening of my taste for Hot Pot - and likely my new go to. It's a newer location with the owners converting their former AYCE sushi joint into this more niche and unique business.  Service is attentive, quick and friendly, and they were more than happy to walk me through the differences and hot this worked (I kinda knew already but I like to play dumb sometimes).  Best of all, you don't really need a small posse, you can come solo or with a friend (or stranger you meet in the line outfront). If you're looking for something different that you you can enjoy all year round, this is the place for you. But make sure you make plans to get their early because they do get busy most nights!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Excellent prices (24.99 for weekday adult, free clear soup base) and a good selection of good quality food makes this my go-to AYCE hot pot place. The main server there offers excellent services too. My friend asked for raw chili, but normally they don't serve it (cuz it's not on their menu), but they managed to get some chili, chopped it up, and gave it to my friend to put in his sauce. Absolutely brilliant. I rarely find good service in hot pot restaurants (the only other time was at Little Sheep at Warden).  The only complaints I have with them is that they shred the beef omasum and reticulum too much. I would much rather have a bigger piece. Also the style of their pot takes away some of the volume of the pot that could have cooked more yummy food (haha). They're very minor complaints that don't really take away from the great prices and food.  Bottom Line: Arguably the best AYCE hot pot restaurant.  Quality: 8/10. Services 8.5/10. Value: 9/10. Overall: 8.5/10 (Not an average)."}
{"text":"Here the hot pot in cooked in a traditional Beijing-style funnel pot instead of the Canton wide pot. The red meats and vegetables tasted fresh. There is a wide variety of tofus, noodles and seafood options. However, the seafood tasted a bit off, so beware if you have a sensitive digestive system! The service was decent for a comparable hot pot place. Would come back again if my hot pot cravings return!"}
{"text":"Found this place online among fellow Yelpers' post. So my friends and I decided to give this place a try. So we had a reservation for 10 at a specific time. However, we had to wait 20+ minutes before our table was ready. Very typical \"lack of controls in place\" for an Asian restaurant. Also, this place is very small and be prepared to feel the warmth. One word of caution, wear a tee-shirt.   So after some wait time (note, we had a reservation), we were given our table. Started flipping through the menu and deciding on what we were gonna order. The soup base came not long after and then all the food came in a quick rush. We ordered the AAA Grade beef + the rib eye. Not bad, haven't had the rib eye for hot pot before. So this was a treat. Also try that squid paste as it's got great texture.   If not for the somewhat long wait for our reservation, I would of given them a higher rating."}
{"text":"i have to say i agree that this place is 4 star. thr aaa slice beef is great. it has just the right kind of marbleing. the lamb and pork belly was also pretty great. thr service was efficient and responsive and the soup base was decent. the only things that prevents it from being perfect is that the soup base was quite pricey and no free option was available. the dipping sauce selection was limited. the sugar cane drink they had. had a weird funky taste that wasnt regular sugar cane. and no matter how often we order. the leafy vegetables just never made it to our table for some reason"}
{"text":"What's the best time for hot pot? Trick question. All the time. You can always use a good meat sweat. It detoxifies the body and the steam makes your skin nice. It's practically a spa day! Probably. I don't know. But I do know, 100% for sure, that hot pot warms you up and nourishes the soul. Even when it's hot out, just turn on the AC and you're good to go!   If it wasn't for a friend that set up a dinner here, I would've never discovered Beijing Hot Pot. For one, the Chinese name mentions nothing about Beijing. Despite this, it is repping the region proudly. The \"Beijing\" part comes from the Beijing style funnel pots. Food and service are both top-notch and at $30 AYCE, that's a great deal. I'm not usually a spicy fan, but I can't resist the \"mala\" flavours of Szechuan. They've captured that in a soup base. Another awesome soup base is the wild mushroom chicken soup base, which feels like a home remedy by grandma.   The ingredients themselves are of great quality and fresh. What's even more refreshing is the absence of a \"premium\" menu, where certain items like seafood are unlocked only when you pay more. I already do that way too much for games and apps, I don't need that irl. Also included are things like fried dough sticks (??) and crispy buns with condensed milk (???). You don't realize how perfect it is to pair crispy buns and hot pot until you've tried it.   Service is one of the best for a hot pot restaurant, nay, a Chinese restaurant. Firstly, they SMILE and are actually engaging. Secondly, they're on top of things so when they say they're following up on a missed order, they're actually doing that and not just saying it to shut you up. Thirdly, they are able to split bills, a seemingly simple task that too many restaurant don't do. Lastly, they speak English!!!!!!!   As good as Beijing Hot Pot is, they aren't without faults. I hate that these new places are charging for drinks. I've said it before, I'll say it again. Don't pump me full of salt and leave me hanging. How much does plum juice cost you anyway. Also water was dripping on my friend all night. And they spilled water on my jacket. Unfortunate, but ultimately forgiveable.   It's pretty clear from the high ratings that Beijing Hot Pot doesn't disappoint. I can see why. I certainly didn't leave disappointed. The only person that left disappointed that night was the confused guy that came in, surrounded by boiling pots, and asked for a \"takeout menu\". Tough luck, man.   (90/100) - 2017"}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my Fiancé and we stopped here for dinner.  It was our first time trying hotpot and we loved it! The food and the broth was really good. Also great great service! I'll be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Traditional northern style Hotpot! And all you can eat too! When we went we were on a restaurant hopping tour and this was the 10th and last restaurant of the day (no judging!). Yet I still managed to chow down many of their dishes and ice cream desserts. Service is attentive and friendly. Definitely coming back for a second round during our upcoming visit."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday, reasonable price, all kinds of meat with good quality especially the AAA beef, a variety choses of fresh food, decent environment and service. Great place, will go back again!"}
{"text":"2.6/5  I absolutely don't understand the hype of this place but I think its a decent edition to the neighborhood. It's a cleaner hotpot restaurant around the neighborhood. Unfortunately the service and the quality of the food didn't meet the expectation. Servers are exhausted and I had to go to the front desk to put my order 3 times, missed a lot of orders I placed and hotpot broth & ingredients are mediocre at the best.   I'm not sure if I'll go back here since I prefer to travel little more for better hotpot at this price.  But again, it's not a bad hotpot spot for the neighborhood. Not travel worthy but a ok for a quick hotpot fix."}
{"text":"Hot pot in my hood?  What could be better?  Well, by first glance when you drive into the plaza you question if you are in the right spot.  But yes you are.    This little gem is a great find!  It's actually a decent size (but it gets quite busy - and were were there at 6pm on a Sunday - well before the dinner rush).  It's clean and the staff are friendly.  The best part is that everything was fresh and the platters of meat are just there - platters.  Not a few slices - but meat upon meat upon meat.  We had lamb and 2 kinds of beefs.  They certainly did not cheap out - you get the quantity and the quality here.  We also chose octopus, scallops, fish, some veggies (b/c my mother told me i should always order veggies).  You can split the soup base (it's *.99 for spicy and $6.99 for the other bases) - we got spicy and the normal one.  There was a mushroom broth as well that I wanted to try - but next time.  The spicy isn't that spicy - it's actually mild in my opinion.  So feel free to order this version if you are scared of spicy - you can handle it!    This isn't the cheapest place, but honestly for the quantity and quality and that fact there is free parking - it's all good to me.  Also, all the items are brought to the table - you do not need to go up and get your own ingredients - that's a plus for me b/c sometimes I'm lazy :)"}
{"text":"Good service! Delicious shrimps! Frozen muscles!  Speak English good friendly staff Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great! Is this a new hot pot place? I don't even know, I don't even know how we ended up here, but we're happy we did! The food was good, fresh, and plentiful.  One unique thing about this place is that aside from the usual soup bases, you can also get a plain water base, and it's free of charge. I don't like how after awhile, at other hot pot places, everything kinda takes on the same taste because the broth has gotten all concentrated and permeated everything. With this water base, all you taste is the natural taste of the ingredients, and you don't get sick of it so quickly. I really enjoyed that! Aside from that, though they didn't have as many ingredients to choose from as some places, everything was fresh, and the service was friendly and quick. This might become our new go-to hot pot joint!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Very friendly staff. I had a party of 16 people for my birthday and they were very accommodating. They were quick and provided us with our orders. They replenished our water and soup base whenever we needed.  I wouldn't go with a group less than 6 people because their portions are huge. There were lots of variety on their menu ranging from meats, seafood, veggies, to noodles. They charge extra on fri-sun and charge extra on different soup bases (pork bone, spicy, mushroom) other than water soup base.   For dessert, they only have 3 flavoured ice creams: red bean, vanilla, and green tea. Their ice creams were too watery and lacked flavour. I would go for dessert somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good quality meats and ingredients! The service was top notch, the orders come quickly and they ensure your soup base is replenished.  We didn't order too much, but the portions per order was small, but it was good for 2 people.   Would come again!"}
{"text":"4.5  Pros: Awesome hot pot Good prices  Cons: Location is on the smaller side for hot pot Not much variety in sauces  An excellent hot pot restaurant in North York?  Oh yes it's true I say.  If you're a fan of hot pot, you definitely need to give this place a try!  It's by far the best hot pot restaurant I've been to in North York.  First off, this place is the definition of hidden gem.  It's hidden in a plaza behind condos near Fairview Mall.  You would not ever expect to find a hot pot place in this area.  If it wasn't for Yelp, I would of never found this place at all.  Walking in, you'll notice this place is on the smaller side for hot pot places.  Turnover rate at these places are definitely not quick at all.  We came in early when it was empty because we went early.  Within 30 minutes the place was full.  During peak times, expect some wait times.  The prices are very good for this place.  I've seen places range from $5 to $10 more per person.  I like that they split the kids prices into 2 categories.  I've seen places that charge the same for a child who's 12 and a child who's 3.  Doesn't seem fair for someone with a 3 year old but this place takes care of that nicely.  The food here is excellent. You would think that with the price difference the food would suffer a little but that is not the case here.  My only gripe is they have only 4 pre-made sauces to choose from.  I like to be able to make my on sauce so that bothered me a bit but it's no deal breaker at all.  The sauces they do make are all great tasting.  All in all, it's great to know that there's an excellent hot pot restaurant in North York.  Just get there early if you don't like waiting like me."}
{"text":"The food is  wonderful, fresh, good taste and elegant presentation. Service is quick, the waitress comes by every few min to make sure everything is good. The host/owner cares a lot about the customers and makes sure they feel welcome and appreciated. 10/10 best hotpot I've ever tried, and the price $25 is icing on the cake. We tried everything on our visit, everything they offer is amazing, not a single dud."}
{"text":"Been to this place three times now and it's been amazingly consistent.  Easily the best part is the service.  They generally don't forget any food items, they're really quick to bring your food and they're just really nice in general.  The place itself is visually appealing and well taken care of.  They can get busy though so go early on Fridays and Saturdays - they offer to take your phone number when you're next.  There's a pretty wide range of food choices so everyone will find something they like.  Their greens and sides are really fresh too - some of them are really potent in flavour.  The spicy soup base is also really potent so think about how much spice you like before ordering it!  Should also mention that they don't have much in the way a variety of sauces, though this didn't bother me.  Price is $24.99 (+$2 for Fri-Sun) per adult all-you-can-eat, plus an additional ~$5 for the soup (charged to the table, not per person), which is super reasonable considering their food quality and service.  They take cash or debit.  They have drinks and multiple seafood items that are a-la-carte though.  Only downside was that the lobster tail my girlfriend ordered apparently wasn't washed very well (she mentioned it was a little grainy).  To sum it up: Go here if you like hot pot - or even to try it for the first time.  They're amazing and the price isn't nearly as ridiculous as multiple other places, especially if you live in Markham.  It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"I haven't hotpot for a long time and I've never enjoyed the idea of hotpotting at a restaurant. But this restaurant surpassed my expectations on the food and service. I came as a group of 13 on a Thursday night and though there was a slight miscommunication with the reservation, they were quick to accommodate us. The space was very tight though. Service was attentive and all our orders and requests were fulfilled in a timely manner. Menu had a wide selection and food was fresh! I will definitely return to this restaurant the next time I hot pot outside."}
{"text":"This hidden gem hot pot restaurant is perfect for a cold winter day (or really any time you're craving hot pot). When you walk through the door, you'll be greeted by the warm, ever so slightly steamy air. The inside is very nicely decorated, with fancy furniture and artwork. The service unfortunately is pretty bad, which is one strike against the restaurant. The servers never stopped by our table once - we always had to flag them down. Perhaps that's just the expectation here.  But the food is delicious, which is why you're here in the first place. Ordering is simple: you pay a flat rate per person ($25 for an adult), plus a small fee for your broth (~$5), then all ingredients are free (excluding a few fancy ones which cost extra). They give you a sheet where you can check all of the different hot pot ingredients you want, including different types of from beef, seafood, vegetables, mushrooms, tofu, noodles, and more. Some of our favorites were the sliced beef, the mushrooms, the radishes, and the quail eggs. Some to avoid include the shrimp (too much work) and the duck tongue (mostly bones). Your per-person fee even includes ice cream at the end of your meal! Though note that it doesn't include drinks - if you want soda or alcohol, that's extra.  Overall, we had a fun time. The food was tasty, and the interactive eating experience of cooking it all yourself made it a blast. Come here with a few friends or family members for a memorable meal."}
{"text":"Definitely a bit further from most location, but one of my favorite hot pot places in Ontario. What made me a fan was the quality of the meat. You can taste the difference as each piece is sliced perfectly and extremely fresh. The menu is limited, which is ironically a good sign at all you can eat places - with a larger selection of items, the items are typically not fresh given the high rate of spoilage. The broth is amazing as well! Would highly recommend to get past this winter season in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I didn't notice it before cause it's hidden in a small plaza...But! It definitely became my go-to for Beijing style hotpot restaurant after my first visit! Everything was fresh. The dipping sauce was amazing! My favorite is their seafood options. The waiter was so polite and patient."}
{"text":"I loved this place. It looks big, bright and clean. The owner who served us had a pleasant attitude and was hospitable. Good service. Lovely food. Would recommend."}
{"text":"We went here at 2pm on a Sunday. Freezing rain will not keep me away from my hotpot! First thing that I noticed was the decor. Didn't expect this place to look so nice. It is located in a small plaza surrounded by apartment buildings.   But! Lets talk about:  The food Great selection of meats. They did not cheap out on the quality. Really good and very generous. Really delicious cuts of meat. They didn't have as much of a selection as I had hoped but what they did have was really good. I came in hoping for a sauce station but they have you check off on the order sheet which sauces you would like (again, small selection). This seems more sanitary to me and this also means I wouldnt have to wait in line for that delicious peanut sauce.   The service The gentleman helping was nice. We asked for a few things that I thought would be given right away at the beginning (like a ladel and tongs- but most people apparently just use their chopsticks). But after that he intuitively got us what we needed. For the most part he was 2 steps ahead of us in anticipating what we would ask for.  The price Its a little pricey. Again, they did not cheap out on the quality so it is $24.99 for adults plus $2 on weekends. The soup base is $6.99 and $8.99 if you get two. I think it was worth it but if you have a small appetite you would not be getting a bang for your buck.   Overall, I would go back for when hotpot cravings hit. Hopefully not too often as I would have to work overtime to afford my lifestyle. Lol"}
{"text":"The service here was top-notch.. from the attentive staff to the preparation to the cleanliness of the restaurant and quality of the food! All the ingredients they had here were also fresh! The variety of things you can put into your hot pot are extensive - noodles, mushrooms, vegetables, lamb, beef, fish balls, tofu, taro, shrimp, lotus, and more. You have to pay extra if you want a more flavorful broth. In my opinion, ~$30 for all you can eat is definitely worth it. We came here Sunday afternoon and did not have to wait in a long line; We were seated and served immediately! Beijing hot pot was the perfect restaurant to go to on a cold winter day. Come hungry and leave over-stuffed!"}
{"text":"Amazing food,  Everything was so fresh! The pots were really stylish and the soup was amazing. I wish there is more items on the menu for a all you can eat place. But again the food was great, had the pineapple juice and it was delicious  Definitely am going back again"}
{"text":"Price is pretty good for what you get (unlimited hot pot for $24.99).  The staff are extremely friendly and very efficient.  As terrible as it sounds (I can say it though because I'm Asian) I've never been to an Asian restaurant in Toronto where the serving staff are genuinely so pleasant.  The selection is quite good too and the quality of food brings me back to hot pot in Beijing.  Would recommend this to anyone out there!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a random plaza opposite from Fairview Mall and surrounded by old/developing condos is this restaurant. I recommend coming early (around 5:30 pm) because after 6 this place is packed.   Let me just start off by saying the food is not super fresh here. I ordered the napa cabbage a few times, and each round the napa was yellowing and had freckles on it. Also, the meat portions are inconsistent and range from giving you 10 slices to 5?   My partner and I shared a litre of watermelon juice. Definitely do not recommend getting that as it was watered down AF. There was barely any watermelon in it!  Also, I felt like the place was quite dirty as our table was super sticky.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend coming here. Despite this being the only place in Toronto with the traditional \"old school\" style of hot pot, this is not worth the money or the trek."}
