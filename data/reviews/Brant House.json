{"text":"Pass on dinner if you have a choice. 
I ordered off the set menu since it was a work event. The salad was probably the best part of the meal. It was mixed greens, pine nuts, goat cheese and butternut squash. The squash really differentiated it from other mixed green salads. I ordered the steak frites. It was way too chewy (I have my steak medium rare). I only finished half of it because I got tired of chewing. My colleagues enjoyed their steak so one of them tried mine and agreed - way to chewy, he had to just force it down. I guess it was just my steak that was sub par. The dessert was a disaster. White chocolate brownie was turned into what tasted like a dense, dry cake mix with a crusty sweet bottom. Most people didn't even finish a quarter of it. It was sad to see the waiter take away plates with most of the dessert on it."}
{"text":"Not the greatest experience.
Long line (and it's freezing cold, I mean get some heaters, canopies... but they have nothing!!!).

Then you get inside, again a wait for the coat check. Same thing, management focused on so many things that they are forgetting about the basics. Does it make sense to wait in line for 30+ mins, and then wait again for coat check 10 mins... WTF???

Basically, it's the same Toronto night club garbage. Despicable service & exorbitant prices. When is someone in the industry going to implement a basic concept- a great experience from the line up, coat check, to getting a drink? As far as I understand night clubs are a SERVICE, however most lack in providing a top quality experience- and Brant House is unfortunately just like the rest."}
{"text":"I was never one to mince words, so I'll just come out and say it: The Brant House is absolutely terrible. Pretentious and yet middle of the road. This is where the 20 something club district goes to tow the line. The layout, staff and music selection is completely unimaginative and the patrons have little if nothing to contribute in either conversation or dance. Plus, it boasts one of the worst sound systems in the city. It's not even bad good. It's just bad."}
{"text":"oh brant house. you were going to be my club experience in Toronto. Instead it was 90 min in line because the \"guest list closed\" and they were \"at capacity\"...unless, ya know, youre a 90 pound bleach blonde with a pack of fake tanned bimbos...then you'll get right in! sorry drunk friend inside. I'm sure by the time we got in you wouldnt have remembered us."}
{"text":"Been here many times and have never had a bad night. I am not a club person at all but I've always had a great time at the Brant House. The music is always good, not just Top 40 but older stuff that I grew up with so it makes for a really fun dance party. 

My last visit inspired me to write a review as we had one of the best waiters I have ever had. My friends and I went for a bachelorette party (dinner then dancing after) during TIFF so things were already a little crazy to begin with. I am sometimes difficult to have dinner with because of a dairy allergy. Since we could only order off the Prix-fix menu and EVERYTHING had dairy in it, I thought I was going to go hungry. Not the case at all.. our waiter Scott went so far out of his way to make sure everything he was going to serve me was dairy free. Thank you Scott!! You are awesome!!  I even got the best dessert out everyone with me.. a huge martini glass filled with all sorts of fresh berries, it was delicious! The food was decent for a bar but because of TIFF and some very minor inconveniences, we all got free appetizers, a free round of drinks and a free bottle with our bottle service. That was pretty nice of them!

If you are looking for a fun time in Toronto, I highly suggest this place!"}
{"text":"On Saturday, this place is awful.  The music is weird (am I at a rave? No!  I'm in a dark lounge!), the wait staff are overloaded and the people are highly douchey (yes, even you if you're there on Saturday).

But, if you go on a week night, the atmosphere is super chill, the decor is great and food is actually pretty good, for lounge appetizers.

BUT, this place isn't as great as Chill Winston in Vancouver.  That place does the dark-classy-lounge better than anything else I've seen.  Just sayin'. [http://www.yelp.ca/biz/chill-winston-vancouver]"}
{"text":"Awful. Went there on guest list for my friends 30th birthday. Basically a pub, they then drag away tables at 10:30 or so and attempt to make it a classy dance floor.
Music was awful and the when asked if the dj had a popular top 40 artist said we don't have that here.. And then plays it about 20 minutes later. Weird 
Also we got there before 10:30 on the guestlist but don't let that fool you. Guestlist dosent mean
Anything, still have to pay $10 even though we came super early and were told it was free cover.
Beers were $6 and weak mixed drinks were $8. 
Won't ever be coming back. 
Save your money and time!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday and it was PACKED. One of those $20 cover dealios that gets everyone sweating. 

The line to get in wasn't a line, more like a mob surrounding a classy bouncer. He wasn't an overweight hulk; he was dressed up in a suit and headset, commanding the attention of everyone around while still being totally polite at all times. The place was slammed so it took a little while to get in- even with guestlist. Not fun, but understandable I suppose. 

We get in and it's sweet! Very nice decor, people everywhere but not the point of being crowded. It dawned on me then that maybe that's why the line/mob stays a bit bigger than it should be. They could just throw everyone in, but instead they keep things comfy and to outsiders, it looks like Brant House is the place to be. My favourite is that on the dance floor, you can break out your best moves and not have to worry about hitting someone/thing. 

It's just a great balance of a lot of things. I loved the music and everyone was really friendly. By friendly, I mean a lot of strangers want to share their bottle service. Thumbs up! Tequila shot, Vodka Cran- just standard drinks and no complaints. 

I'd like to go back for a normal, non-event night to compare, but as a venue and club on this night- A-OK!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy partying with douchebags and 905ers, then go to this place."}
{"text":"Depending on what your going for this place can be the best or worst experience. 
If your looking for a night out drinking,dancing with the girls/boys -MISS . if your looking for a lounge atmosphere with a mature crowd and/OR a quiet dinner , its a jackpot!
The staff-  friendly and attentive. 
The place is one big room, lots of dark wood. The lighting is dimmed with lots of candles. ( awesome place for people watching)
Crowd varies ranging from 23 - 50. 
I noticed lots of older men with suite&tie chatting up the ladies that are dressed younger but clearly appear older hanging around the bar area. There's 2 bars at both ends of the room. 

The crowd that come for dinner are a bit younger and dressed well. NOT a shorts/t-shirt /jeans kind of spot.
Tables are long with high bar stool style chairs, centre of the room. Really useful if your in a group.
If its just 2/3 people, chances are you'll have another couple or small group sitting beside you.
 
On fridaty, I went for dinner with a friend ,and tried the summerlicious menu. 
Tried the salad for appetizer - awesome but extremely buttery
The chicken with veggies for entree - perfect if you're watching what you eat or want something light.
Chocolate Brulee for desert - its just a rich chocolate square. Too rich and a tad dry for my liking.

My friend had the tomatoes herb soup for appetizer - cold but very nice if you like the taste of cease rs
Steak and fries for entree - the steak was well prepared but the fries were bland. 
Cheesecake for desert - pretty good and delicious with the graham bottom.

came up to 102$ with 2 rounds of drinks! (including tip)

overall, I like the place mostly because you can dress up and have wine and dinner with your girls. If you choose to stay for the club part its convenient for a \"go with the flow\" night. 

m."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place because it's usually not as crowded as it should be on a Friday night, so there is lots of space for dancing and drinks. The drink standards and music is not that great, they could do more with the dance floor. 

In terms of food, I found it below average. The menu itself is so limited not a huge variety. I had fried calamari, poutine and salad. Again average menu with mediocre food. Nothing exceptional or extraordinary. A typical supper club. I would come back for drinks but not for the food."}
{"text":"Among all of the WORST nightclub/bar scene on King Street West, Brant house is the best...

I called Brant House once after looking at the website (which no longer exists), I was impressed simply because they had the lounge remix version of one of my favourite jazz songs as the backdrop to their little dotcom domain.  
A women answered, she was able to find a table for me and three girls I was planning to bring with me.  The plan to was have dinner then, and when the restaurant transform into the nightclub, we would grab some drinks, but there was one problem; she asked me for my credit card in order to secure my reservation!
I wasn't about to give my credit card information to some girl over the phone, especially when that woman works for a bar!  There was no other way to book the reservation, and so I hung up without making one.  
Seriously, now that is pretentious!

That night after dinner, I found myself on King Street West with my three girlfriends.  I told myself earlier that I will not go to Brant House, but what can I do?  Blame women for everything.

We were able to get inside very quickly without having to line up because one of my girlfriends probably was sleeping with one of the bouncers.  This is my explanation for everything.

The one amazing factor about Brant House was that the bouncers did a good job on controlling both the number of patrons who came in, and regulating the traffic of the people who managed to get in.  I didn't have to squeeze myself together when going from one bar to the other.  I can't comment on the décor because it is a nightclub and I couldn't see shit.  

At the corner of my eye I caught a familiar yet stranger face, immediately recognised as the SEXY teacher's assistant to my economics class teacher I had back in high school.  
Here's the story.  I was 17 years old and she was fine as hell...I actually approached her once in high school and stupidly offered her my welcome on behalf of all the hormone driven boys at our school, and offered to show her around if she wanted to.  I was fearless!  But really I was quite scared..I think I deserve mad props for hitting on a University Grad at that age.
Now that I am more experience and smoother, I grabbed her gently at the arm, smiled...and then realised I've completely not prepared anything to say to this woman.  I have unconsciously approached this woman for the second time in sheer stupidity.
\"Hey, did uhh...did ja teach at uhh...that school however many years ago?\"
\"Yes, were you a TA there as well? She said with the look of confusion.
\"No, no I uhh...I used to go there...\"
\"You used to go there?\"
\"You used to go there?\" She said, screwing her face slightly.
\"Yeah...uhhhuh hah hah..\"
\"Oh, you used to go there...as a student!\"
\"Yah..\" 
\"Okay..\" She said.
I think her name was Seline, and Seline looked at me utterly annoyed, then recognising me as the kid who who had the balls to hit on her.  Then she turned around, and I did my loser walk back to the other side of the dance floor.  
I'm not ashamed, it was worth it!

The music is not too loud but not great, the environment is actually tolerable and allows for breathing.  The women here are okay, not amazing but that bad.  The most exciting area is unfortunately the outside line area where all of the weekend rented supercars park in order to show off.  Unremarkably just another King Street West bar.  Ridiculous credit card reservation policy.

Still not ashamed."}
{"text":"Brant House, you've had your last shot. I've been twice in the last couple of months, after a 5 year hiatus, and was LESS than impressed. Actually, you could say that I left pissed, with a very sour taste in my mouth.

First, not unlike every other club, you start out by paying $10 cover. Then, $2 coat check (now that it's getting too cool to leave your coat behind.) So at this point, we're $12 in the hole, and the night hasn't even started. 

The bouncers tend to be a bit stuck up, and generally rude. The bartenders are okay.

The DJ is a damn train wreck. I appreciate that he's trying to be creative, but he's too self absorbed to realize that his mixes are terrible, and it's at the expense of every single person having a good time. How are you supposed to enjoy dancing when they guy starts out with a really cool beat, and then effs it up by mixing in some garbage song? Don't mess with a good thing buddy. Notice those artists are millionaires, and you're not??? Ya, that's because they know the difference between something that sounds GOOD and something that sounds AWFUL. Don't quit your day job pal. And if you're the owner/manager/person of influence at Brant House - take note, you need to start looking for a new DJ stat. I wouldn't be so disgusted had it been a one off, but it wasn't. It was two separate occasions that he screwed with my enjoyment. 

So, end of the night comes, I've been wearing high heels for 14 hours... feet are killing. Like beyond killing and I want to go home... but guess what? No one's allowed out the front door (right near where I parked my car, knowing that when I had to go, I'd want it close.) I wasn't drinking, and I wasn't being unreasonable, and asked the bouncer really, really nicely if I could please use that exit. No. Oh, and he laughed in my face, taking enjoyment in the fact that I was desperate to leave. Everyone has to go out the back door which leads you to a different street altogether, meaning that I had a lengthy hike to get back to my car... and almost in tears I might add. I was pissed. Beyond pissed. Brant House has gone waaaaaaaaay down hill since my youngen days, and I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"After years of retaliation and staying clear of almost everything in its vicinity, last night, I was coerced (forced) into the front doors of Brant House.

I'll toss up 1 star for giving me a spot to see a ton of old friends from high school and university, in one place.  Bottle service and sport coats to match, they seemed to be having a fantastic time, and that made me smile.  That was about it for the positives though.

The DJ's were \"one-two-checking\" on the mic for absolutely no reason, the music was a tasteless mix of late-90's hip-Pop (I thought we all agreed that Nelly was to be eliminated from our history books), the standard crowd pleasers (Bell Biv Devoe, R Kelly and Keith Murray, never would have seen those guys comin) and a couple of \"hot new tracks\" that fell off about 6 months ago. (Am I being overly critical?)

The bouncer at the front door was way more pleasant than I expected him to be, but regardless, line-ups at the front-door that have nothing to do with capacity issues inside, is something that I just can't condone.

Anyway, it was a good learning experience.  I totally forgot that spots like Brant House still exist.  If you're looking for a place to get dressed up, drink your face off (at $9.00 a drink) and dance to some really popular tunes, you'll probably have a decent time here.  

My jeans, comfy kicks, un-gelled hair, and more importantly, my thirst for endless conversations with awesome new people, just don't bode well for these types of environments."}
{"text":"Like this place on Thursday...and Thursday only.
Compare to last year patrons are getting progressively worse."}
{"text":"Went just for the clubbing portion of the night on a Saturday.  The music was good, but the scene was strange.  85% women, and almost all 40+ in age.  I liked that it never got too cramped to where you couldn't move around, but mostly I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Come here on a Saturday night and there will be a huge line up in front of this lounge. This is how you skip the line and get inside in no time...

Get bottle service and come with a huge group of only girls. 

Kinda sucks you have to rely on spending the cash (approximately $250 a bottle plus 17% gratuity) and leave the boys at home in order to guarantee quicky entrance and attentive service, but that night we were celebrating a stagette. So we did it!

We had a fabulous time! Danced the night away. Closed up shop and didn't leave until the lights came on.

Granted we were already drunk a$$ before we stepped into the place. Granted we ordered too many bottles that we didn't even finish the alcohol we ordered. And yes, we were so drunk, we would have danced anywhere and to anything. LOL!

But hey, spend the money, arrive already drunk and you are guaranteed the most memorable time that you won't be able to remember! But I'm warning you now, the next day, you probably won't feel as hot. Haha!"}
{"text":"This was easily my favorite club we visited during my trip to Toronto. We came here twice, both on a Thursday night (we tried coming back on a Saturday night, but we just had too many people), and had an absolute blast.

The cover is $10, but it's nothing if you get in before 9. There is also a $2 coat check if you want to use it, which I think is fantastic as it was the only club we went to that even offered the option.

Apparently they also serve food here, so I'm guessing based on Todd's review below that its primary focus is a restaurant. Usually these restaurant into night club transformations fail tragically, but I think Brant House pulls it off quite nicely. I even saw people getting served some nice looking dishes around 11'ish, so I'm not sure what time the kitchen closes down.

The decor of the place (aside from the country-western bar looking tables in the middle) is a great low-light, dark color palette with ultra plush couches and large tv screens that show some really freaky shit during club hours. There is also attendant service in the bathroom, which is just another nice touch Brant House added.

I had one of the best bartenders ever on my last visit to Brant House. I didn't catch him name, but he looked about mid-30's with a closely buzzed haircut (sorry, best I can remember!). I left my card with him and got almost instant drinks ahead of others all night, and he made them much better than the 2 other bartenders I got drinks from earlier.

The DJ here was ok. He started out with all 80's tracks for close to 30 minutes, which was getting quite old by the time he switched over to music that we recognized. The rest of the night was pretty much all hiphop from the last 10 years, pretty cliche but still mixed nicely at least.

My one real complaint with Brant House was the dance floor. It is entirely too small, and I think this is where the restaurant/club idea hurts them the most. On a busy night it is PACKED, with very little room to even move to the bar. They do the best they can to clear out more space by removing all the chairs from the middle table section, but this doesn't really help much."}
{"text":"went here for friend's bday party on a friday night. 

COVER:
I liked that there is no cover before 9pm (a bit too early though could have been until 10pm) but it gave us time to come together earlier and chat in almost total quietness since the place was empty until around 11pm.

DRINKS:
not sure about food but the drinks (mixes) were only plain $3 until 10pm! I'd say they were too diluted but for $3 I'm not gonna complain.

DANCE FLOOR:
It took them a while to understand that we came there to dance. Only after about 30min and 10 of us dancing between the tables did they move them around and created a sort of a dance floor.

TV SCREENS:
there was some weird show on the TV screens but hey did you come there to watch TV?

might come back just for the cheap drinks."}
{"text":"Boring.

 That is pretty much the word that sums up Brant House. The revitalization happening in \"King West\" brought many new venues for wining and dining, but I didn't realize that along with it, came such a shitty attitude.

 Brant House (no the) is one of those typical lounge/club places that is supposed to appeal to the older club goers who want to go beyond Richmond street. It also seems to appeal to the lesser kind; people who are stuck up and like crappy music. I went there for a birthday party, not knowing what I was getting into. Being among friends always makes a crappy place bearable, but Brant House is awful in so many ways.
 
  Firstly, the music is what you'd probably find your 14 year old cousin listening and grooving to, and even that is a stretch. It's a mix of top 40, hip hop and mediocre dance, perfect for grinding to!

  Secondly, its a very typical and oh-so-tired meat market. Ladies in barely-there and men happy to stare, I saw more pick up attempts than a cleaner on the 400 series highway on garbage duty. Unless you like this sort of thing, I'd say pass with a big red flag.

 Lastly, the food and service was terrible. I can't elaborate further, but hopefully what you've read is warning enough."}
{"text":"I organized my work Christmas party this year and decided on Brant House. We had 50people attend around the ages of 30 to 45.

Our party went extremely well. I'm still hearing how everyone loved the food! It truly went way beyond my expectations. The chili chocolate cake was delicious. The Waiters were very polite and attentive.  The atmosphere and decorations were great although the music was loud during dinner and was hard to talk to colleagues. It was impossible to make any announcements.

The music was great after dinner. The variety was awesome and dancing until 2 am was easy and fun. 

The only down fall was one of the security guys was very rude to me for no apparent reason. He was telling me to tip the coat check girl when it was really none of his business and I had already done so anyway. It put a damper on the night. One of my other colleagues had also mentioned to me that security was not treating people with respect. It was sad to hear for such an upscale place because other then that our night was perfect. 

I will definitely think of Brant House for our party next year."}
{"text":"Quick line, relatively cheap cover, good crowd that is actually there to have a good time, and bouncers do their job the right way. Seems rare in Toronto to find places like this that do things well but don't take themselves too seriously."}
{"text":"Went there this past weekend for a friends Birthday. I didn't have to stand in line so I am not sure what there wait time is like. The bouncer and the door man were relatively pleasant. Coat check line a bit too long (may be because it was 11:30). But, I stood there in line for about 10-15 minutes. Bar service was pretty good, no waiting around to get a drink. At a given time they 4-5 bartenders. There is a back patio for smokers with a bar and plenty of heaters and washroom are cleaner than most clubs.

If going to clubs is your thing, I suggest it worht a visit to say the least. I had to take away a star for music, other wise this I would give Brant 3 starts."}
{"text":"I like this place because for the most part the crowd is mature.  The music is alright, a mix, I just enjoy the atmosphere.  People are happy go lucky (for the most parT) not pretentious.  I generally have a great time here, when i go.  Music could use a little work Ie: house and trance nights, something more modern....dj's sets, opposed to happy repetitive pop....yikes."}
{"text":"Came on the recommendation of a bar tender at the Spice House across the way. The DJ was sporadic his selection of music and refused to take any requests. Lots and lots of people, clean bathrooms, crowded, but lots of cabs waiting outside at the end of the night. Not my favorite place, but it wasn't terrible either.... It was probably a 50/50 mix of girls/guys (maybe a tad more number of guys), and I was surprised at the number of middle-aged ladies there just to have a fun girls night. They weren't trying to be cougars or anything, just wanted to have a good time on their own."}
{"text":"Recommend to go on Thursday, free entry before 930-10pm depending how busy it gets and domestic beers are only $3. At one point banana JD shots, rum and vodka cocktails were $3 as well but it became too popular. 

Thursday are completely more relaxed then the weekend snubbyness, easy to get in, cheap coat check, and lots of seating. You can arrive somewhat early and stick around till 11pm where it starts to get livelier."}
{"text":"I feel weird giving this place three stars because two hours prior to hopping into a cab in my open-toed leather heels in -15 degree weather (hey, don't judge - it was my first time as a Vancouverite partying in Toronto), I scanned Yelp and all I found were 1-2 star reviews.

Anyhoo - I never went for dinner, I was merely put on the G-list and got in without braving the cold for too long unlike all the other people in line, in their closed-toed pumps, mini skirts and skimpy tops. 

I got there around 1030PM, so people were still sitting at the tables, eating dessert. Everyone else was just standing around awkwardly, looking around at everyone else standing around awkwardly and looking back at everyone else. *sigh* Yeah, welcome to fast-paced, exciting world of nightlife. 

It stayed like this for another hour or so until the VIP section began filling up (which btw, I think one of the bartenders said it was 240$ for a bottle and you had to get two bottles in order to sit on your own little section like all the other cool people who pay more than $500 just to sit in a little booth and stare away at their phones all night, texting) - and within 30 minutes it seemed to fill up fast. 

So if you're reading this, I think you're probably trying to figure out one of two things...

1) What kind of crowd can I expect to see here?

- Pairs or groups of 3 middle-aged average-looking guys standing around near a post, watching whatever sports game is playing on the telly
- Not more than one pair or group of 3 cougars at any given point in time - easy to spot not by the crows feet or saggy, wrinkly decolletage but by the lack of ability to dress age-appropriately (note: cropped leather vest revealing saggy pierced navel is not HOT but rather REVOLTING)
- Pairs of 50-something aged, balding men with beer guts creepily attempting to stand within arms reach of the only group of just-barely-legal girls dancing
- Chubby trailer trash in red lace shirts, complete with muffin tops jiggling out, arms flailing with the only thing going for them being their long blonde hair making them look semi-appealing from behind

2) What kind of music do they play?

- Stuff you used to \"rock\" to when you were in Grade 5 to Grade 9
- Stuff your parents used to rock to a few years prior to your conception
- The occasional song you'd hear on 93.5 but only lasts for a verse and chorus and then gets mixed into one of the above options

So you may be wondering if I had a good time...I'd say yes, it was okay. 

At around midnight, it doesn't matter how much you pay to get into the VIP section to sit around and make sweet sweet thumb-love to your iPhone or Blackberry, everyone ends up pouring into that section, the entire place gets pretty jam packed and around 2AM it's time to brave the long-as-hell coat check line again. 

And at 4AM, it's finally time for the stupid taxis to start picking up half-frozen people up off the streets and take them back to their homes rather than driving by with no one in the cars, no lights on and only selectively picking up those who live in buttf&^k Ontario."}
{"text":"This place is much like how I envision hell would be. Terrible music, terrible crowd - I couldnt believe that when I left people were actually waiting in line to get in.  I do have to say the interior is really cool, but at 10 pm all the tables are moved and the place goes schizophrenic from a dinner lounge to a dance hall. It was the most bizarre transformation ever.  I recommend if one of your friends sentences you to hell and makes you go here, that you hang out back outside with the smokers and the outdoor bar."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night with a large group of out-of-town guests after having dinner at Spice Route.  Got there relatively early (10 pm) and was surprised at having to pay cover when people were still having dinner.  Three of my friends got in and joined me at the bar, when my fourth friend got in and said that the others were having trouble at the door.

We went back outside to be told by management that there was a special \"Family and Friends\" dinner taking place, and that they couldn't allow us in at this point.  Having been inside, it certainly didn't LOOK like a family and friends event, but a convenient lie to keep a group of guys out of the establishment.  Moreover, we were told, a couple of the guys were dressed inappropriately (however, they were NOT given the option of going home to change, which we would've easily taken). 

In any case, after making me wait while he chatted about a fight that took place last weekend and subsequent unfavorable review online (which he actually took as a good thing), the manager did reimburse us for the $30 cover we had just paid and we were off.  At the time, we were quite disappointed, but if it were not for that rejection we wouldn't have ended up at Pravda where I ran into an old friend of mine DJ'ing and had an incredible time.  Oh, we also dropped $600 on bottle service which Brant House missed out on."}
{"text":"As King Not-so-West starts to build up more and more and the gentrification seems to continue unabated, it's small wonder that more and more higher-end restaurants are going to open in the neighbourhood.  In comes Brant House.  A newer addition to the neighbourhood, it received decent write-ups in the Toronto Star (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/toronto-star-toronto) upon its opening.  And truly, any place that's walking distance for me is going to be tried out.

The décor is very dark, modern and elegant.  When I asked for a booth, I was expecting a typical four-seater that you get in most restaurants and not one that, though elegant, could house a Maple Leaf's line change.  Big is what I'm telling you.  Servers are polite and efficient, you are not left wanting or in need of anything, really.  All seem conversational and not unprofessional.  You'll have a nice exchange and not have to hear about what their cats threw up on that morning as they were getting ready to leave.  I'd thank you to return the favour for them.

Food came out promptly, and tasty.  The steak I ordered hit everything in the right places, those being rare, tender, and tasty.  The wine list is quite decent so looking for something to complement the meal shouldn't cause much grief.  Be warned, I took an early dinner service.  It may turn into a dance club afterwards, so if that's not your deal, book early."}
{"text":"Is it a restaurant? Is it a club? Is it a lounge?  It's all three, but does none well.

I went here a little while ago to celebrate a friend of a friends B-day. 20 people reserved for a 9PM prix-fixe meal.

The Good:
-Service. Before and after the whole party arrived we were made to feel comfortable.  Unlike some places, we were able to take our seats with only 10% of the party present.
-bread. warm bread. YUM!
-Price.  $35 for 3 courses. For King W its not that bad.
Appetizer. A sizeable salad of mixed field greens, shaved root vegetables (carrots and either a purple carrot or a beet or something like that), and real parmesan cheese and a onion vinegarette. I would have preferred dressing without wine/cider vinegar, but i will not hold that against them. 
-really good looking wait staff

The Bad:
-The Main.  Steak frites. Asked for medium received a [warm] medium well. Fries were tasty, but overly salted.
-The Dessert.  Can you even call it that? A cross between a cookie and a cake. No flavour, but with a dollop of whip cream and some unknown berry type thing on top.


The Other:
-After 9 PM this place turns into a \"club\". A club you say?  Do they move the tables out of the way?  You would think so right?  Well, they don't.
-TVS.  There are 3 large screens with projectors.  They would have 2 or 3 different think on the screens you would think right?  Well they had the same movie on all three screens on a loop, so I saw parts of the movie twice.
-Cover charge.  WTF?  How can this place start charging cover after 9 PM? Hmmm?  Maybe its because they close the second set of doors so you can't see how crap it is inside.  or maybe its how they set up some truly ghetto stations outside making it appear that  at some point there may be a line.

The Verdict.
-This place is overpriced and over rated.  The only saving grace was the waitress that gave great service."}
{"text":"So I've been to Brant House multiple times and I have mixed feelings about it. I've always gone on thursdays and it's always been packed.

The Good
- lots of people and lots of space
- cute outdoor patio in the back
- acceptable place to get foolishly drunk


The Bad
- packed/small bar area
- fairly pricey drinks


The Ugly
- sweaty 30 something bankers with their ties loosened dancing like fools and singing top 40 

Conclusion: If you want to get loose in your suit on a Thursday, Brant House may be your ticket to a hangover at work on Friday."}
{"text":"Everyone here is trying a bit too hard. It's a very sad, stereotypical night club experience.

As you can imagine, they play top 40 cheese to the extreme. 

It can also be hard to gain entry when they get busy (for men).

There are probably 20 better dance venues on any given night in Toronto. There is a very diverse music scene in this city, and you're not getting it here.

I implore you: Find something better!"}
{"text":"Anything could happen at the night club.
But I personally love the Brant house.
Not too fancy not too casual .its perfect place to have a fun with my
close friends. 

Even you don't have a booth, you can still sit at bar chair which located close to entrance. Some bartenders  are very rude and looked stressed who only cares about tips some bartenders are friendly and nice.

Overall,more than ok for me .
We just need to enjoy without consciousness :-)"}
{"text":"Titled \"The Non-Experience/The Internet does not like the Brant House\"!

Here is a different kind of review (not club related, rather restaurant but also really poor). 

Booked today online for a 5:30 PM dinner for 1 (Winterlicious) to experience Brant House as a possible venue for a corporate event for approx. 75 people. I booked online using 'Open Table' technology. Had my reservation confirmed and a copy of the confirmation email with me.

I arrived at 5:25 PM and the woman working the front/desk reception today at 5:30 was beyond words. She certainly looked great in her Chinese New Year attire, but the compliments end there. I shared that I had a confirmed online reservation for today at 5:30 PM.  She seemed stunned/incredulous that this reservation did not show up on the piece of paper in her hand. She actually asked me if I was certain that I reserved at the Brant House. (Yes).

She went on to say (this is hilarious) \"the internet is not very friendly to the Brant House\"; she was pretty clueless regarding online reservations. She made a big production of seeing 'if she could fit me in'. At this point I am thinking 'geez, don't do me any favours, I have a CONFIRMED RESERVATION.'

She offered no apology for the mix up (grumpy Internet that doesn't like the Brant House ;-), and offered me a seat at the bar, or get this - a spot at a table for a massive group - me alone at a table fit for big group. 
I moved on, she didn't care. 

For certain I won't be back and not one of my corporate clients will see the inside of the Brant House. Really shabby. Hey Brant House -- heard the economy is still hurting and everyone has options.

PS If you offer online reservations, you might want to understand the technology. The Internet is not a 'person' who doesn't like the Brant House. It is here to say, good idea to figure out how it works."}
{"text":"I had a great girls night out at Brant House but that was because of my company.  We were able to get in quickly but there was a $10 cover which I thought was a bit expensive..especially since this \"lounge\" isn't that upscale.  In addition to the cover we were charged $2/person for coat check which was surprising.  I've been to much nicer lounges/bars in Chicago where there was no cover AND free coat check.  I wouldn't have minded paying if the establishment was posher.  The music wasn't that great and I noticed that they seem to love Drake..but maybe that's because we were in Canada!  The DJ definitely needs to work on his transitions between songs because they weren't smooth; he would jump from one genre to another with pauses in between.  Also in the beginning of my night, Brant House was super crowded that you could barely move or dance but it improved as the night went on.  Overall I had a great time with my friends even though I just complained a lot, but that's because we make the best out of any situation!"}
{"text":"This club is okay.. Nothing special to remember, been there once and no more urge to return. There are better places than this."}
{"text":"I have been many times for a night out and have to say the crowd is far from enjoyable these days. I recently went for dinner (around 7pm) as it is close and found it way too loud to have any type of conversation. The food was simple, but very well prepared and enjoyable."}
{"text":"I was held at the door becuase my shoes where dressy enough even though I was wearing dress shoes...I wait the door man let in someone with sneakers on (which somehow were dressier then dress shoes). Finally got in becuase we knew a promoter...It was nothing to cry home about..Music was terrible and the service was even worse..I would avoid this place"}
{"text":"They've renovated in the last year or so. It seems a little too impersonal now. Like it is a business, not a place to have a good time. They didn't open the dance floor until 11:30pm and the DJ kept changing the songs and tempo so fast that you could not enjoy dancing to it. They crammed the place like sardines on Friday. 
This place has passed it's prime."}
{"text":"Never went here for food so can't comment on that.

We go here every so often and usually have a decent time.  The crowds a bit older; it looks like people are coming from work rather than from school.  Drinks are the usual club prices. $10 cover is nice, and on Saturdays the place actually gets packed (Fridays are hit or miss). 

Atmosphere looks like a restaurant with the middle turned into a dance floor.  The layout's actually pretty good.  They've got a couple projection screens that play the music videos.

Music is usually top-40 with some mashups mixed in, towards the end of the night they start to play some classics, but it's nothing too special.

Dress code: for guys you need a collared shirt to get in and no running shoes.  They're pretty strick about it (at least they have been to us, even though the bouncer recognizes us).  For girls i dont think it really matters as long as you're not in sweatpants.  If you're a large group of guys or are rowdy, they'll make up excuses/reasons when you get to the front of the line to not let you in.

Coatcheck line is always long for some reason, especially at the end, but it moves decently quick.  The bouncers don't do anything about people budding in line so don't bother complaining about it."}
{"text":"Brant House is a fun lounge to party at.  

My U of T friend took me here and he says you can sometimes spot Raptors players hanging here.  If you come early enough, there's a happy hour deal you can take advantage of."}
{"text":"For dinner, this place is expensive, and I would skip it.  It's not really a restaurant, it's more of a club.  Go somewhere that is a restaurant 100%.

At night this place is good place to let loose over drinks and music.  Well dressed mature crowd.  Interior is modern and elegant.  Music is fine... the usual.  

My overall experiences here however have been mixed.  Sometimes I'm bored and just want to leave.  For that reason I give it 3/5

{"text":"This place is a little hit or miss. I have only been here for drinks/dancing and never eaten here. Its a large venue and usually pretty easy to get into.
Its not the trendiest place, so sometimes it is way too empty. There are often a few older people who don't quite belong.

Overall the music is usually pretty good. They will play top 40, good house and then some great hip hop and reggae. We usually have a good time on the dance floor."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner last night, we were a group of 17 and had a table reserved. We arrived and were brought to our table. The hostess and servers were nice enough, not bad, but also not great.

First off, the interior was nothing special. It was somewhat classy and elegant, but still a bit casual. The atmosphere was quite boring. 

This place is way too overrated, and food is definitely not worth the money.  We ordered off a prix fixe menu (3 courses, 35$ + tax and tip). The starter was pretty bad. It was a salad with different greens and a few shaven vegetables. It tasted like we were just eating grass. There was absolutely no flavour even though there was a viniagrette on it, but apparently not nearly enough. Half the table didn't take more then a few bites.

The main entrees were also not so great. I had the steak and frites. When the dish arrived, the steak was cold. However the fries were pretty tasty, crispy and buttery. The other entrees (roasted chicken or baked salmon) apparently were also not so good.

For dessert (chef's choice), it was a butter tart. This was pretty much a tart that you could find in any local bakery for $1-2. Why would they serve this as a dessert in a restaurant like this? Not good, was VERY dissapointed with that. Many were left untouched. 

I should also mention, the service was SO slow. It was as if the staff were just taking their sweet ass time to prepare our food and serve us. We were in the restaurant for a total of 3 hours. It took 30 minutes for us to get our salad, and nearly an hour for our desserts.

I'd skip this place. Total for each person ended up being $45 or $50 a person if you ordered a drink, tax and tip included. For a shitty meal, definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"They dont always have best crowds, but over all they still win over tons of other places over the years for location(King/Brant), food, service, music, crowd consistency of great events, and nice bouncers. Only thing is I dont go to clubs to pick up guys, if you go with a nice group of ppl just for a nite out then its a great spot to go for Halloween! Sometimes U get pretentious douche bags n much older guys trying to pick us up on a occasional girls nite out, just ignore them!!! =D And I like how Brant House is connected to Cobra , u get to do one stone two birds going to two places one time. =D"}
{"text":"Stay at home and order a pizza! I will try to keep this review very short without getting into too many details... If you are planning on dinning in this place expect the following:
A. Wait for 2 hours for food.
B.Get your orders mixed. 
C. Pay extra for the right dishes because the kitchen won't make new ones unless you speak to a manager.
D. Wait for 20 mins for a manager to show up. 
E. Wait another 20 mins for your right order.
F. Have very loud music in the background throughout dinner. 

It was my first and last time there!"}
{"text":"Its not my thing, but found it decent. From what I could tell it looks nice inside although it was dark

I ended up coming here after work with some colleagues. Just drinks and chat."}
{"text":"Brant house is a laid back place that treats it's customers well.  They have $7.00 beers and a great DJ every night on the weekend. I great place to have fun!"}
{"text":"I was at Brant House on a Friday night had dinner then went to Cheval (which is down the street). 

We were in a big group (it was for a bday) and I must say all the food was excellent. I had steak with steamed veggies and it was cooked perfectly. The Burger and fries is HUGE.. so if you're really hungry you should order it. I found a lot of the guys were ordering it because as they put it \"it hit the spot.\" 

The atmosphere was good too. Once the lights dimmed down and the music I found myself really enjoying the place. The DJ played a bit of everything, but he looked like he just came from a baseball game which was disappointing... don't ask why...I was just let down. 

As far as the crowd goes you had a big age group.. people ranging in age from 21-65... So it would have been interesting to see how the evening progressed once the night really got started. 

Oh and the drinks were cheap! 3 drinks (vodka water) was only $12. 

I'll probably go back again at some point.. when I'll do I'll give you fellow yelpers an update!"}
{"text":"The crowd at Brant is awful on a Saturday.  Friday is the night to go.  People pretty much keep to their selves but going with a big group is great!

Music is random at times but it's usually a song you want to hear, plus in the winter they always have the fire blazing channel on the TVs... I love that channel!!!"}
