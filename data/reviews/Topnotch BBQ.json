{"text":"This restaurant is just over 2 months old and is a welcome treat to the Las Vegas/Henderson area...great smoked meats and delicious sides...This weekend me and 3 of my girlfriends enjoyed a great meal...live music and few drinks...we didn't have the sweet potato pie (we are counting points...LOL) but I have tasted it and its great as well"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ and burgers!!! Best part? They have Kool-aid!! So much better then famous Dave's"}
{"text":"???????? Is this place open?? The website doesn't work, neither does the phone number.. I want to know before I go there if its open!  Sure would like some BBQ."}
