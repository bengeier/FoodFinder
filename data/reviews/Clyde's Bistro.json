{"text":"Finally got a chance to dine in at Clyde's and loved it.  I had the Bison burger and it was cooked perfectly.  The service was great and the inside is charming!  I would totally recommend this place for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent, that's the best way I can describe Clyde's.  I've dined there three times now and each time there were issues for either myself or my boyfriend.  The service has always been slow but friendly and the last time it just plain clueless.  The server was clearly new and very unfamiliar with the menu.  On our first outing, risotto was still on the menu and it was a gummy mess.  When we asked if it was made to order the server admitted it was made in advance.  Bad move!  Thankfully that has been taken off the menu.  The other major issue that night was the timing and the temperature of the food.  This was maybe 5 months after they opened so the timing should not have been this bad.  It took 45 minutes to receive our meals and when we did the side dishes were cold.  Cold fries are a major turnoff.  While the proteins (fish & chips and pecan crusted trout) were hot and perfectly cooked, it spoils the meal when part of your dish is off.  Deciding to give the place a fair shot we went a second time a few months later and the food was on par.  We both chose different dishes than our first visit, Coq au von & Ribs, and they were as expected.  The only complaint that night was with the slow service.  This was also the second time I had the spinach side dish, which I loved both times.  Based on the overall success of our second outing we visited Clyde's again this past Monday for their all night happy hour.  Again we chose different dishes to try, the eggplant panini and fish tacos.  I ordered the spinach side again since it was so fantastic the first two times.  Well that was a mistake.  The spinach came out barely cooked in a pool of water with no seasoning.  I asked the server if I could get an order with the right seasoning and she asked me what I meant, clearly she didn't know the menu.  She brought me a new order and it was more of the same so she offered to take it off the bill.  The eggplant on my panini was tough, overcooked and hard to chew.  A real disappointment and the fries were cold again.  My boyfriend really liked the fish tacos but his fries were cold too.  Considering that we've had two out of three meals where one or both of us have been disappointed with the food Clyde's is too much of a hit or miss for either of us to consider returning.  It's a shame.  They have reasonably priced comfort food and great specials but I can't reward inconsistency with my business."}
{"text":"Good service, good food, something Cleveland Heights needs.   Menu has a good variety of steaks, seafood, pasta, and sandwiches.   The prices are fair, not cheap but the food isn't either.  I got the Chicken and mushroom lasagna and my brother got fish and chips both were really tasty. The pom frittes were good, like Penn Station just not greasy."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp. Called and had no problem getting reservation at 6:15pm on a Saturday, which concerned me.  No worries, had a great meal with efficient low key service.  The only issue was a constant the constant banging from the kitchen while they made chicken parm(I asked).    I had the chicken coq a vin and my wife the salmon; both were excellent.  Her iceberg wedge with blue cheese was very good.  Even the bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!! Bryan Oddo is the best front of house manager of all time.  His jump shot needs work though"}
{"text":"I went there twice in one day actually. Wasn't planned, just happened that way.   Anyway, I went there for lunch and had the pulled pork sandwich. It was tasty and quite large. Needed to eat it with a fork cuz it was so messy. The fries that they served with them were good too just a little salty.  For dinner I had the broccolini. I love broccolini and almost anytime I see it on a menu somewhere I order it. This version of it was quite good with the inclusion of clams instead of the usual chicken. The noodles and broccoli were both cooked well and not overly soft. The sauce for it was very good not too salty or too thick nor too runny.  Did not save room for dessert so I don't know how those are.  They do have a wide range of beer and wine as well."}
{"text":"I have dined at Clyde's at least 6 times since they opened. Each time, I enjoyed the decor, food and service. Last night was a DISASTER! The first two items I ordered were \"out\" although the server did not know that until she put the order in. When I finally settled on my third choice, the food took almost 45 minutes to arrive. It was OK, but not even close to their usual quality. I finally asked if the restaurant had experienced a change in management, and was told they had. Too bad...it was a nice neighborhood place with consistently good food. The server was pleasant, but she was put in an uncomfortable position given the overall circumstances."}
{"text":"I went in here for a quick drink while I was waiting for my takeout from Mekong River and I was pleasantly surprised when I sat down a the bar and noticed I came just in time for a late night happy hour.  Happy Hour runs 5:00-6:30 and 8:30-10:00 every Tuesday through Saturday.  It's half off all appetizers and drinks (all drinks).    I ordered a beer but it seemed like with the half off and they awesome mix drinks I saw being made, that would have been a better choice.  Although they did have 5-6 taps and I got some kind of Thirsty Dog, wasn't sure the flavor but it definitely tasted like raspberries and normally that would be pretty gross for me (not into sweet beers), but this one was pretty good.  Also when I ordered she asked if I wanted a small or big beer and I went with the small which seemed like a pint so that big is probably a 22 ouncer but who knows.    I was waiting for takeout so I didn't order an appetizer, but some people behind us got the parmaesan garlic wings and they smelled amazing.  Really from the moment we walked in, everything smelled really good.  They also had pretzel rods, a popcorn machine and twizzlers for the bar patrons (3 of my fav snack foods).  They also had live music playing in the back dining room.  Now for some reason it didn't seem like it was still called Clyde's anymore.  They had a little banner above the door that said something with the word bistro in it but no Clyde's so not sure if this changed ownership.  Seriously though that happy hour is a crazy good deal.  When you order 2 beers and your bill comes to $4.00 that's pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice lunch. Bread was served before the meal - a nice touch. FIsh and chips were tasty (\"chips\" were a little too salty). I liked how they served the ketchup and malt vinegar in little dip bowls, it was very attractive. The puff poulette looked amazing, can't wait to go back and try that next time. Will probably take advantage of the full bar next time too. And they apparently have a party room in the basement."}
