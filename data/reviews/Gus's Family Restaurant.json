{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint in Cleveland might just be an understatement. Every time I've gone I've been treated like family.  Great food, amazing prices. Go here now. Seriously. Go. Now."}
{"text":"My wife and I live all the way out in Painesville Ohio and we take the 75 mile round trip ride to Gus's at least 3 to 4 times a month!!! The service, food and staff are always very friendly, greet us with a smile and treat us like family. The cooks make the best breakfast in town and its always an incredible value. Janet, Carol and the rest of the staff are all tops in our book. We have lived in the greater Cleveland area all our lives and have come to find that Gus's is the best diner in Lake, Geauga and Cuyahoga county area. I do now and always have recommended Gus's to anyone looking for a great meal at a great value. In fact we just got home from there today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mike & Sijana, Painesville, Oh."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland, I popped in to escape the rain and get a coffee. On a whim, I noticed they have corn beef hash, which I like but I'm often disappointed by how most places do it (too much clove).   How surprised I was to find this place has one of the best corn beef hash's I've ever had. I asked for some info about it, and they make it in house. Really great so if you're in the area and you like corn been hash, this is a great place"}
{"text":"Located in a house/converted restaurant, Gus's is the best! Perfect for a night after drinking and debauchery. Mediterranean omelet with gyro meat is delicious. Huge fluffy omelet, gyro meat, tomatoes, spinach and feta cheese with a hefty portion of home fries. Whenever I go, I make sure to sit in my favorite waitress's section. The cooks look like Dane Cook straight out of the movie Waiting, but that adds to the experience and I don't doubt them in the kitchen. Extremely cheap, good company, friendly crowd, great food.   Cliffs: -go before 10 or finding a seat is tough. -Gyro omelet or die. -I love Carol the waitress!"}
{"text":"Carol you are the best service person/waitress I have ever met. I believe you must be clairvoyant...I just THINK coffee and you're pouring it. Our orders and sides took a couple of trips, but everything arrived hot and ready. The excellent service continued even after we paid as   carol followed me out to make sure I didnt forget the babys juice. How awesome is that? I go to alot of restaurants some $ some up to $$$$.  Carol who works at gus' s is the best!!! Now--the food--my daughter really liked her food especially the french toast. My grandaughter said her ham and egg muffin had the best ham she ever tasted. The sausage gravy not great but biscuit was very good. I got over- cooked eggs, very dry like chopped up old potatoes, and there was a seasoning in the corned beef that I did not like.  The corn beef was properly cooked and some people probably like it--just not me.  If my daughter had written this review no doubt it would have been a 4 or 5. She liked everything. Maybe new  visitors will too. At any rate, try to meet carol.  The other servers seemed quick and friendly too."}
{"text":"I gotta say I'm surprised the overall ratings are so low. This place, in my opinion along with much of my family is the best small breakfast spot with the best value that we know around. The gyro is really good and so is all of the food. You'll never be disappointed going here."}
{"text":"I've been to Gus's a couple of times for breakfast. It's definitely a good hangover cure and they certainly don't do anything wrong! The corned beef hash is pretty good, though not my favorite, and the hash browns are tasty. I would definitely recommend this place to someone who needs a little grease for brunch."}
{"text":"\"I'm sorry you experienced that\"  Great line from one their fantastic work staff!  This was the last meal in town for a friend who \"always wanted to go, but...\" After our meal she regretted not going sooner.  It is a small, funky, great joint.  Good stuff is the hash, Chicken Fried Steak, Omelette and the saucy waitress we had!    (I visited on my Bday last Aug, 2013, just cleaning up my draft reviews, I reckon I had hoped to ad photos)."}
{"text":"Stopped here for late breakfast. Good food, good prices. Fast service. You can tell that it is one of those neighborhood places where the regulars and the staff treat each other like family. Customers seem loyal and are willing to look past old, outdated and falling apart interior.   Place was good, has potential to be great."}
{"text":"I have been going to Gus's for over 15 years. I have never been disappointed. It is a local favorite and you can tell the wait staff knows and likes their customers. The food is tasty, fast, hot and cheap. The bathrooms are not the best, but the food and local flavor makes Gus's a great place to ear"}
{"text":"The pancake is not good , yelp probably won't let me post this but it is true  Plus there is no parking   Plus the cup is dirty   Plus they didn't give me the kind of egg I ordered ."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, and great customer service. The breakfast menu or the entire menu his place is the bomb. Carolyn and Janet are amazing and caring."}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered hashbrowns and it looked as well as tasted like the cook just smashed a potato on the floor with his shoe."}
{"text":"Okay.... Soo. Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of breakfast food. I usually end up being hungry after breakfast so I tend to avoid diners. BUT, my cousin strongly recommended Gus's so I humored him. By his recommendation I also order the gyro sandwich. Wow! Let me tell you... It was pretty frickin good! Arguably one of the best gyros I've had. Ever. And I've been to Greece. As if having an amazing gyro wasn't enough, the chicken noodle soup I ordered was the BoMb!! Salty and noodley just the way I love it.  I would come again.  I would recommend to a friend.  I would get fat if I lived next door.  \"No ragrets\""}
{"text":"First time and we went here hesitantly, but we WILL go back!!!   My husband had the corn beef hash with poached eggs and I had eggs over easy   Everything was GREAT. I know you may think it's crazy for me to say since we had the basics, but it really was. The home fries were amazing!! They cook and peel their own potatoes right there and you can tell. Nothing added to them, just yummy !!!   Two coffees and two full breakfasts and our total was $12.05!! Don't believe me? Here's our bill"}
{"text":"I drove past this place every day, and decided to finally check it out on an off day. I'm glad I did. Food was great the service was great and all-around good time. I think I will be back."}
{"text":"Everytime I call off work and have a craving for something, I end time going to gus's for their humble gyros with grilled onions, extra meat and homefries. To me its very filling and not bad for around $7."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. It's a small place but the staff are nice. Parking across the street. Cheap breakfast."}
{"text":"Ok it's been awhile but this place rocked!  In tow with wife & 3 kids, we ate like royalty for under $20!  Awesome food & service, so get there, I need to again!"}
{"text":"I love this part of Cleveland, a small area called Brooklyn..residential streets are paved with red bricks, neighbors are friendly.  It sure gives off an upstate New York feeling. Gus' is a quaint joint that serves breakfast, lunch, dinner food. It  the newest of places but sure feels like home when you walk in.  The wait staff are very friendly. They offer free WiFi,  just ask for their password. I ate a late breakfast while on a conference call. Wait staff was extremely friendly and patient with me allowing me to order once i was finished.  Never once did my coffee cup get close to being empty, the wait staff was exceptionally on point with drink refills and courtesy.  Food is much better than any Bob Evans chain because its made with love and the prices are almost in my opinion to low. But my pockets and full stomach were not complaining! Awesome mom and pop diner, many regulars were in and out while i dined in. They offer take out, call ahead takeout and a wide variety of food options from omlets, breakfast combos, sandwiches,  soups. If you're in the area check it out!"}
{"text":"As good as you would expect it to be, nothing more nothing less. We've been coming here since D's Diner closed and the service has always been friendly - and they are quick to refill coffee, you never have to ask. Takeout is super quick. Food is cheap and good."}
{"text":"Another stop on my sister and I's diner dining adventure. This place, just like Steve's, definitely satisfied. I would actually claim them winner of best corned beef hash.. But the serving size in comparison to other nearby places is dinky. So hm... delicious but small, or decent but big? Really, it's whatever you value!  Here we notably ordered corned beef hash (obviously good, as mentioned), blueberry pancakes (a little dense, not fluffy), and a gyro meat Mediterranean styled omelet (hard to go wrong with). All great for the price, but not the winner of our diner hearts."}
{"text":"A friend recommend this place, so the boyfriend and I stopped in for a Friday lunch. Server was rude, complained about doing her job constantly because it was \"2pm\" (they close at 3; we arrived at probably 1:45). Bitched because a family with their two kids wanted decaf, because she's not used to making it at 2pm. Apologized to the kitchen because they had to make what I ordered... at 2pm. Fish and chips should be taken off the menu since it would be better from the frozen food aisle. Boyfriend said his omelette was \"just ok.\" The ambiance reminded me of an episode of Kitchen Nightmares, but worse. I hate to shit on a local business, but I work hard for my money at work, work that I do with a smile on my face only to pay to be treated like a nuisance on my day off. I stopped at the post office on Biddulph after this lunch and had a better experience. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I order from Gus's usually weekend mornings there service is quick and there pretty good thumbs up! If your looking for almost home cooked breakfast lunch or diner this is the place!"}
{"text":"Great traditional \"greasy spoon\" diner that is locally run and owned. I fed my entire staff for lunch for under $30 (there were 4 of us).  Wheelchair accessible with a small ramp to get into the space, there is one dinning area that is not accessible as there is one step to get up and down that area. There are booths and movable chairs at movable tables. I had a burger, staff had a falafal, another burger, and soup with omelet and everyone was happy.  I did not use the restroom so not sure if it is accessible. Servers were polite and attentive and we never wanted for anything during our meal."}
{"text":"Excellent, fast service, and good, home cooked food is what you're going to get a Gus's.  We stopped in for breakfast today because Cafe Miami was oddly closed.  Upon arrival, we were told to sit wherever we wanted at Gus's.  We found the nearest booth and made ourselves comfortable.  Our server took our drink orders within the first minute.  Two minutes later, they were served.  Then she asked us if we needed a moment to look over the menu, which we did.  I had a hankering for biscuits and gravy, but then I saw the veggie omelette.  It's tough for me to pass up a veggie omelette.  When the server returned, I ordered the veggie omelette with home fries and wheat toast.  She asked if I wanted cheese and I said, nope.  My wife ordered eggs and bacon with homefries and toast.  She repeated our order and headed over to the kitchen to place it.  Within 6 minutes, our breakfast was steaming before us!  That was really fast service, we thought.  I love fast, accurate service!  The omelette was tasty and they had two different hot sauces to boot.  I love hot sauce on my eggs and home fries.    As far as atmosphere goes, this place is a work in progress.  The people are wonderful, the food is solid, but the place could use a little updating.  But it's a diner, so I don't really care.    Three stars for food and atmosphere, four stars for service!  The server was down home terrific!  I'll be back for breakfast for sure."}
{"text":"We had a great time here for breakfast. A group of 12 of us flew in from LA and needed some breakfast before heading out Erie PA for the weekend. The grub was great. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The staff were great. So nice and accommodating to our big group. Our server was so good too. She didn't mind writing up separate checks for all of us. Food came out fast and hot."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to get a nice breakfast or some lunch. Its very small but you wont regret eating here. I love the breakfast home fries are off the hook not every restaurant has good homefries. The reuben is pretty good with thousand island dressing . The coffee is good , and I would probably give 5 stars but if you call for a to go order its usually the waitress that answers they should have a hostess / expo even thou its small . Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of the top cheap diner's in the city. Pancakes are great. Corned beef hash is also good, but the amount in one order could be a little more.  Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Good food for a great price! It's your typical diner brunch and lunch food with accommodating staff. I usually go here with a large group, and they're always very understanding."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, fast pace restaurant,  fresh food delivered quick. Breakfast restaurant.  Small dining area but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing! Fantastic! Can't get a better breakfast. There's lots of breakfast joints in the OB area but this is by far one of the best! Fast service, great prices and tasty food!"}
