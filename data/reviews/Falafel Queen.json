{"text":"I went there after a band show with a friend. The guy behind the counter was pretty friendly and helpful. The presentation of the food speaks to casual atmosphere of the restaurant and the quick and inexpensive eats you get there.  The price for the food was pretty standard for what we ordered, but I've had better tasting shawarmas & hummus around Toronto. I do think they need to improve on the taste of the food, but in all fairness I was there after 1 a.m. and it's not likely that they have freshly cooked foods at that hour."}
{"text":"Solid shawarma and falafel, especially for a late night snack. Often less busy than the poutine place next door, but equally satisfying and with slightly more of the food groups. It's not haute cuisine but it hits the spot, especially at 3am."}
{"text":"Tasty shawarma, fast service, open late, all good things.  BUT!  The price on the board over the counter is different from the price on the blackboard on the wall, and it looks like the higher price wins.  Ask how much your sandwich is going to be before you order it so you don't end up like me, shaking pennies out of my wallet to cover the difference!"}
{"text":"Personally, I probably wouldn't have walked into this restaurant by myself. But, a friend was craving for a falafel, so we walked in.  The place looks like its run down a bit, but the lady serving us was very friendly.   OVERALL, nothing special and small wraps. I noticed it opens pretty late (I walked by once around 1:30am - 2am and it was still open), which will probably mean it's my last place I'll go to when I'm craving for a falafel or a wrap late at night."}
{"text":"Can't beat a filling falafel for $3 - I love that they fry it to order. The toppings (lettuce/tomatoes) could be a little more fresh or the wrap a little warmer....but I do like the mint and hot sauce! I'd totally come back!"}
{"text":"Ali is #1 and so is his shop.   You feel warm inside cause of his friendliness and cause it's hot af in there during the summer.   Worth it"}
{"text":"Definitely not bad but definitely not the best. Three of us dropped in for a late night snack after a concert. Although we were the only ones in there at first, the place quickly filled up and the one guy working didn't really move any faster. Granted, he had a lot to do taking orders, ringing them through and making the food himself.  This made it even more annoying that there was another employee in the back chowing down of food of his own without a care in the world that they poor guy working by himself was in the weeds. This kind of laziness shows me that whomever is working there doesn't really give a shit about the place, or their customers.when a place is family owned, you expect a little more pride in their business.  Falafel combo was awright. Not the tastiest falafels in the universe and the salad was a little boring. I might have liked some extra tabbouleh instead. My friends had falafel wraps and they were okay."}
{"text":"Ordered a chicken shawarma from here tonight, and I must say I was pretty disappointed...  The guy behind the counter was super-friendly and full of personality, so that's a plus!!  The chicken, however, was INCREDIBLY bland and boring (tasted like hot grease w/ NO seasoning whatsoever...!!!) and also BURNT, which is why I took 1 Star away.   Also, there wasn't a single stitch of garlic sauce anywhere, and the parsley was old and dry, so there goes the other Star...  However, the rest of the ingredients were incredibly fresh and had a nice lemony fresh touch to them, so that's another plus. The tahini was great as well. Very tasty.  I'm a little on the fence about returning in the future, but I may do so if I'm hard up (aka everything in the area is closed), AND if they take these tips into consideration:  ** Tip #1: Season your chicken!! People crave ethnicity with a Shawarma and it makes a huge difference in the flavour / finished product. ** Tip #2: Don't cut your parsley into \"grocery store nothingness\". Instead, keep it in 3-5 mm bunches. It will add texture and taste incredible. ** Tip #3: Get some garlic sauce! You're a shawarma place, FFS!  Okay, my thumbs are sore... Puh-eece!!"}
{"text":"The shawarma plate m was good.. Mind you, the portion of food itself is measly compared to Sultan's and Ali Baba, etc (my preferred shawarma restaurants). They load up on lettuce and tomatoes and hold back on the protein. Didn't enjoy paying for a plate of lettuce sprinkled with chicken.  Will not return unless I am drunk and/or jonzing for shawarma."}
{"text":"THE BEST FRENCH FRIES IN TORONTO.   I don't know why considering its a falafel place, but they're damn fine. The falafels ain't bad either.  Pick this place for your post-bar snackies instead of Pizza Pizza or burgs in the local area. You won't be disappointed. Fries... yummm!"}
{"text":"lol!!!! forgot I even had this place on my YELP radar and forgot to review it.  Taking one of my out-of-town friends out and around the city, he had NEVER had a shawarma.  You'd expect West Coast Cali folks would have tried it all, but I was somewhat surprised.   So after bar hoping, lounge hoping all over the city, our tummies started telling us to eat! so we went for the closes Shawarma place based on the YELP APP.  Falafel Queen came to the rescue, however if you're looking for ambiance and cleanliness you better look elsewhere.   The guy who served us seems really friendly, all chilled out, and chatting with the regulars that eventually strolled in. The price was decent, portions were satisfying, and filled out stomach, but in terms of flavor, the chicken seems a bit bland.  Thankfully for the other ingredients incorporated into the shawarma it helped.    I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"As you can tell from some of the other reviews a lot of the semi-drunken patrons stumble in off the street hoping for a fine dining experience and are a bit disappointed.  What you do get is tasty food made on a very clean rotisserie .  Yes, you could say they have \"drunk friendly\" furnishings.  There were five body builder guys in there talking about their workouts while sitting on the tables... The staff is friendly.  I asked the guy making my chicken shawarma if he could make it hot and he did. It wasn't nearly hot enough to be considered spicy but it did have a nice flavor.  I my friend suggested I have the tabouli and I was glad I did.  It was very fresh and tangy.   It is pretty good little spot if you don't get hung up on appearances. Add a star if you are out bar hopping."}
{"text":"Shwarma, and falafel pita sandwiches are the epitome of middle eastern street food.  This is and should be the messy, flavourful sandwich that squishes out when you take a bite. Especially if you eat it while driving.  Falafel Queen does not disappoint from this respect.  The flavours are rewarding, after a long day, a long night and a long flight.  This truly is comfort food.   While many may claim that this place is small, messy and dirty. This is fast food falafel and shwarma. I do think this adds to taste, flavour and character.  Besides that the sammiches are massive massive flavor massive size who would have thought a queen would have a massive anything? You can get this anytime all the way into the night! Thank you to my friend who brought me here we all enjoyed this definitely look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Ok for a post 2am snack. I like that the menu offers sandwiches where you can combine chicken/beef lamb/falafel in sandos. Pita was dry. Need to order it spicy. Messy. Spilled it all over myself when I ate it."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. The lady is so charming and friendly, and her food is great. I always think a shwarma shop can be judged on the quality of its tabouleh - so often it is just some roughly chopped, dry parsley and nasty big chunks of raw onion (ahem, I'm looking at you, Osmow's), so to find a humble little place that has a lovely tabouleh, well balanced, fresh (soggy tabouleh is the WORST) and obviously made with care, is really refreshing. $6 for a big old sandwich with all the fixins (including proper creamy hummus, homemade garlic sauce, and pickled turnips) - love it!"}
{"text":"as being in this neighbourhood quite often, i was trying to eat at this place for quite a long time.  one time, i came too late and they were closed  one time, i tried to eat here doing the \"hours on the door\" and the shop wasn't open for business with no note saying why.  one time, i actually swung by on the right day to eat at this place, Finally!   i entered this \"shop\" and it is truly very very tiny, with just a few tables and chairs, i placed my order with the nuetral lady who was preparing my order. FULL DISCLOSURE: SHE DIDNT WASH HER HANDS prior to ordering, during, or after. nor was she wearing any latex gloves to prepare the food with either. i took the food home with me, the flavor was very boring, the actual chicken shwarma was hard, and actually cut the top of my mouth. a further point, was that another customer had ordered a samosa, and the lady threw it into the microwave for 45 seconds and handed the item to the customer   not impressed, not only by the lack of hygiene, and the lack of flavor"}
