{"text":"Russo Espresso is a great, locally-owned coffee shop in Fairview Park. They offer a selection of coffee drinks, teas, and treats. My personal favorite is the Milkway, definitely a must try for anyone who's new to Russo.  The establishment itself offers indoor and outdoor seating, and a VIP room with TV, Wii (bowling tournaments are starting soon according to their site), and free Wi-Fi access.  They use fair trade coffee and organic, local milk. The staff is very friendly.  If you're looking for a great local alternative to Starbucks, give Russo a try."}
{"text":"Russo espresso is dead. In its place is Cyclone Pitas.   In this quiet Cleveland suburb, where I came to see a friend perform a sky burial, I ruminate over a vegetable pita with hummus.   After shamanistic rituals and watching the corpus of my friend disappearing back into the earth, I felt a need for the first time to escape.   The suburbs of Cleveland are just the place. A healthy integration of golf douches, Korean six inch heel wearing/gold miniskirt donning mommies with accents as Midwest as Jimmy Stewart, Aged speed-walking ladies and an assortment of African-American folks, the environs are divine for magicians with nothing to do and nowhere to be.   The coffee is palatable and the pita is as bland as you'd think for a business that opened as a venture and not a passion.   Give me a Mano any day when it comes to living.   But for where it's at... where 'what it is' is just as dead a phrase as the Foghat playing quietly on the JBL's. It's here."}
{"text":"Wanting to support locally-owned and operated establishments, we dropped in to Russo Espresso to check it out today, and we were very impressed. The cafe is a very cute, clean, and quiet space on Lorain Avenue in Fairview Park, just west of Cleveland. The inside is impeccably clean with small tables, two rooms, and lots of bright, natural light due to many windows. In addition to the tables found in the main room, the side room also has a set of board games, a nice brown leather couch, a flat screen television (that was MUTED, thank you!!) and it can be rented for private events. The decor was very inviting, bistro-style with warm pumpkin, black, and cream colors and stone tile. They were playing the Sirius \"coffee house\" radio station that despite being kind of generic, was non-obtrusive. The bathrooms were extremely well kept and beautifully done with tile. It is clear that the owners did not skimp in their decorating. In response to another review, we were told that the menu boards and other signage are in the process of being formalized. The actual logo, web design, and other materials (such as the menu) are very slick looking (not cheap looking at all), so I don't doubt that the final signage will be cool, too. Oh, they also have a beautiful stone patio that will be awesome when the weather warms up!  The young man behind the counter was extremely friendly and helpful explaining the menu and answering our questions. Can we please clone him and replace the other crabby teenagers around Cleveland who hate their minimum wage, service-industry first jobs? We ordered two paninis: the \"Angelo\" oven roasted chicken with sundried tomatoes, goat cheese, & spinach AND another with oven roasted chicken, cheddar cheese, & spinach. They tasted warm and fresh and were served with a side of chips included in the price. We also had a vanilla latte and a caramel espresso that were delicious and smooth (not bitter and harsh tasting like those served at Starbucks). The desserts looked delicious, and we found out that they are made by a local pastry maker.   The atmosphere is very pleasant for quiet conversation, studying, reading, just hanging out playing games, or Yelping -- yay for free Wi-Fi!! I am very pleased to see a new non-chain local cafe near to my house, and will be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Loved this coffee shop.  Great use of space.  The black coffee I had was smooth and robust.  It was a sunny morning and the place was bathed it sunlight.  Great way to start my morning."}
{"text":"Only open for 3 weeks (December 07) and already it's a hit with the local crowd. I tried an iced mocha drink that was the best I've ever had. My iced drinks from Starbucks, Caribou and Arabica tend to have a chalky finish. This was delectable to the very last sip. Good coffee, excellent location, and a great reason to avoid the chains. The logo is adorable but I'm giving it only four stars for cheaping out on the menu boards and other signage. It's all part of the experience!"}
