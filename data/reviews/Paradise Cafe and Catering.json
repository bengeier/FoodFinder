{"text":"I work close by and used to go pretty much every day under the previous owner Allen. I see all the good reviews were made during the time it was his. The new owners are making a bit of a mess of it. They have tried to transition using similar menus and pricing but the food has gone downhill terribly. The portion sizes are a fraction of what they were and the quality of the food has really deteriorated. Speaking with colleagues who used to frequent this place daily they seem most disappointed with the hot food which has gone from generous portion sizes under Allen to what can only be described as tight fisted rationing by the new owners. People are starting to vote with their feet and a new place is opening soon which I think will hurt them a lot."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, lunch or coffee.  Well staffed, quick service and great food.  Try their homemade cheese bagel toasted with butter.  You won't find a better bagel in the entire city"}
{"text":"Allen makes a point to remember your name and greets you with a smile every time. He makes sure you are happy and full when you leave. Breakfasts are amazing and I find myself actually craving the greek salad!"}
{"text":"I ordered butter chicken and it was the worst I have ever eaten. It was like a amateur cooking style.  You pick up sauces and put meat and cook."}
{"text":"I am a regular here, I work a few floors up from the cafe...you'll most likely bump into me for breakfast or lunch (often times both).   Allen is the owner and he is there greeting and servicing customers everyday, he always puts a smile on my face!   Allen changes the lunch specials daily, which keeps the menu interesting and always has me coming down to see what he's prepared.  The menu ranges from Pad Thai, Turkey Dinners, Cabbage rolls, Burritos, Eggplant Lasagne...the list goes on. Paradise Cafe has a set menu for breakfast, sandwiches, and salads. My personal \"go to's\" are: Paradise Club, the cafe's version of a BLT on a homemade bagel (cheese or plain dependent on your preference); Spanakopita and a Caesar salad; and Tuna Melt on flatbread (the dill is great touch).    Coffee and desert are offered as well, conveniently located at the cash out ;)   My personal favourite spot. Say hi to Allen for me!"}
