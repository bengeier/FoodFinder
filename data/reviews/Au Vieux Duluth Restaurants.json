Highly recommended."}
{"text":"In the early 90's this restaurant was my favourite by far and I would ask my parents to take me for my bday.
The food is still very good but way to expensive for what you actually get. No table d'hôte option either and the specials they had going on where nothing to brag about.
We went very early for dinner and even if the place was empty the service was awful. Worst service I have seen in a long time.
No one to greet us at the door because everyone was in the kitchen and we waited almost 5 minutes. We got seated and we got menus and water but the waiter never advised us about the specials or anything. The waiter came back pretty quickly to take our orders and we also got our entrée within 8 minutes or so. Not once did the waiter come to fill our water glasses and I was so thirsty I got up after 15 minutes to actually grab a pitcher myself. Even after getting our food he never came back to see if everything was ok.
The plate we took came with a soup du jour and we didn't know about it. It was very salty and tasted like cane soup.
The only reason why I gave 2 stars is because the food was good.
I will not be going back unless I want to serve myself"}
{"text":"Haven't been here since the 90ies but decided to eat lunch here at a whim. My lasting impression was that they served average food that doesn't deserve to be priced so high. My souvlaki plate consisted of 2 pork sticks, a tiny tzatziki, 3 potatoes quarters, a cup of rice and over half a plate of iceberg lettuce. This set me back $20 with no drinks, appetizer, coffee or dessert included.

This is is a hard sell for me and felt the meal had low value for the price being charged.

Sure... coffee and dessert was available for $1 more buy seriously how is this priced at $20 and not have this included?

The souvlaki pork was good but not enough tzatziki to enjoy even with 2 sticks. The chicken filet my coworker had was excellent. The 3 potatoes quarters were well baked but had no flavor nor salt. Old people food. Our best option was to salt them but even then...they were quite boring. The rice was nothing to write home about and I left most of it in the plate.

The iceberg salad was..... well what you expect with iceberg salad? With over half my plate filled with this salad it certainly looked like filler. Why not romaine or caesar? Perhaps be a little crazy and serve shredded cabbage or kale? 

Perhaps these were options but I certainly wasn't given them. The waitress looked very busy and could afford the time cycles to provide me with the slide options they serve. The service was timely but very rushed.

This place also looks like a car dealership outside from the outside but inside it is a ridiculously beautiful resto. If you value aesthetics over quality of food or value this is the place to go.

As for me, I value quality of food so I don't expect to be back."}
{"text":"On ne peut s'attendre à rien de surprenant. Nourriture grec classique. C'est un restaurant qui est constant, c'est à dire que le menu n'a pas changé depuis des années et la qualité est la même. Les prix ont augmenté toutefois. 

Le restaurant est grand et peut facilement accueillir des groupes. 

Mon habituel : crevette dans le beurre à l'ail, riz, pommes de terre. L'assiette arrive toujours très chaude. C'est bon sans plus. Si vous n'êtes pas amateur de vinaigrette, demandez là à part, sinon votre salade baignera dans la sauce."}
{"text":"Comme d'habitude l'entrée de crevette gratinée sublime, le filet mignon et crevettes  panés merveilleux . Service super et prix abordable"}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimer cette endroit pour son ambiance art déco et glamour. Le staff est très gentil et sympathique. La nourriture par contre moyen, les calamars étaient tendre mis les patate un peu trop.brûlé pour moi. Ma fille a pris les tortelinni au fromage pour enfant à 4,95$. Bonne expérience pour cette endroit, j'y retournerais sûrement. Ils ont des chaises haute pour enfant et un endroit pour changer les bébés au toilette."}
{"text":"Je vais a ce resto 2 fois par mois environ.   J'adore leur brochette de poulet avec salade césar.   C'est un délice!

J'y vais tôt afin d'éviter les attentes car il est très populaire.

Seul hic, c'est bruyant.    La plupart ds serveurs sont souriants.  

Vous pouvez apporter bière et vin."}
