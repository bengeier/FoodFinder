{"text":"Our large group (25) was able to book space early last fall, but sadly, large groups have to pre-select 3 entrees to choose from on the night of the event. Each choice was rated great by fellow diners, but I would have liked to be free to choose anything on the menu. My prime rib was perfect--medium rare::))

Service was exceptional-there were several people in our party with life-threatening allergies that were accommodated without question-5 stars to the serving staff. Questions were answered-suggestions given nothing was too difficult for them.

Because the weather was so terrible, there were many cancellations that night, we had a huge dance floor to enjoy as the musice was fantastic-a DJ who was able to dig out the old favourites. 

We will certainly return here-next time in a smaller group so as to be able to enjoy a broader menu.

Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"This was our second time staying at the Old Mill for New Year's Eve. Such a disappointment from last year.  This year was very disorganized.  People were arguing about table they were sitting at. The organizers set up two tables at the last minute to accommodate people who wanted to sit together.  Dinner was not the quality it was last year. We actually ordered a pizza when we went back to our room. 

Our room was lovely. We had the romance package for our second night which was very lacking in presentation.  We received a bottle of wine, a battery operated candle and a small box of truffles at the door. The rose petals did not arrive.  The romance package at the Hilton was terrific 

We did enjoy our New Year's Day dinner buffet. It more than made up for the unappetizing dinner the night before."}
{"text":"First of all I'd like to tell you the first time my grandparents were at The Old Mill was in 1943. They celebrated their 12th ,25th, 35th and 50th wedding anniversaries there and my whole family have been there for weddings and many other special celebrations.
 
On Saturday January 9th we were there for our grandmothers 90th birthday. To say a number of us were very disappointed is an understatement. Why were we not notified we would not be in the main dining room when I made the reservation? Also we were seated beside another large reservation that was very loud. It would have been prudent to place large reservations further apart. When my grandmother mentioned this concern to the manager on duty she was told they were getting their entrees soon so they would be quieter? Not very accommodating to her concern. Actually I find it to be offensive rather than accommodating.
 
One of my brothers and a sister in law had the ravioli. It was cold. My parents along with others had the lobster bisque. It was delicious and it was not cold but certainly not hot. I would say warm at the best. Is this how you serve your bisque? Some in our party had a Caesar salad. Does it not come with dressing on it? Or the wait staff could have explained it was not the usual Caesar salad when they ordered it. My grandmother was in a conversation with someone when staff removed the remains of her meal, that she intended to take home. Staff discarded the meal.
 
My parents had the ribeye steak and it was incredible and done to perfection.
 
We don't live in the Kingsway so we are not regulars. But for special occasions we like to go to the Old Mill because of the ambiance, service, memories and fine food. We did not have that experience this time. Also my grandmother called to mention her concerns about this experience and spoke to Helen. She took her name and phone number and was told she would get a response. That was on Monday January 11th. So far she has not heard from anyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic thanksgiving day brunch buffet. Everything was high quality, and the variety was impressive. Price was on the expensive side, but totally worth it especially considering that there was lobster available. Dessert selection was also good with a chocolate fountain. Service was attentive but not too intrusive, which is good. Would totally recommend!"}
{"text":"I went in for the weekday lunch buffet. My experience there in short:

The place was a bit crowded but there are also plenty of tables so you are likely to be seated fast even without a reservation. 

The ambience is victorian and comfortable. 

The selection of appetizers, salads, and desserts were superb. There were a satisfying number of items in terms of quality and quantity. The food ingredients were fresh. 

There were not many items in the main dishes section. The quality was good but you might want for more.

In total the fee was around 40. paid the tips gladly because the experience was great. I would recommend this historic place to anyone."}
{"text":"The Old Mill Toronto was all that I expected it would be! The property is beautiful and the rooms are upscale and very classy. My husband and I went there for our first anniversary in December and found it to be the perfect place. (Toronto was so fun in the winter!) We had the continental breakfast and ate dinner in the restaurant. The duck confit was delicious! We also had room service which was lovely. The wait staff and front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed in the queen suite and it was perfect. Plenty of room and with a soaker tub. Although this isn't in downtown Toronto (which I saw as a plus because it's quiet), you are steps away from the public transit system that is very user-friendly."}
{"text":"The setting is beautiful, like an old English manor.  Excellent food.  The chicken tasted great and the vegetables, very good."}
{"text":"It looks deceptively small from the outside, but that's a trick of the landscaping. Old Mill has a big Tudor-style dining/dance hall, and it's clear why it's popular for weddings and other parites. They've got live Jazz some nights, but steer clear of the cover band, unless you want to see a lot of retirees shimmying to bad Beach Boys renditions.

I was last here for Summerlicious, and the meal (lamb with spicy corn and beans) and service were quite good. They have a dress code (jacket and tie), but it doesn't seem to be enforced very strongly--which made me feel a bit silly when I was there looking all spiffy."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Sunday Dinner Buffet with our extended family of 9 including a range of ages.  We were all happy with the quality of food, the variety of options and the service was wonderful.  Buffet includes hot food such as roast potatoes, roast chicken, grilled veggies, guiness beef and mushroom pot-pie, warm seafood, ravioli in cream sauce with spinach, roast lamb and roast beef carving station.  Cold salads of many combinations - all fresh and tasty- one table station all vegan...we all loved the many cold seafood salads including: smoked mackerel, salmon, shrimp salad, herring, crab. Then there's a good amount of dessert options- cakes, small pastries and pudding as well as chocolate fountain for fruit, and other sweets.  There's also more green salads, soups and cheese tray.  We hesitated booking this place because of the several poor reviews, that plus the $40 price tag and the fact that the restaurant website did not list its buffet item offerings.  I wanted to post this to encourage more people to try it- all of the diners in our group enjoyed the dishes and we are a crowd who often do great home-cooking which is hard to beat.  We all felt that the food was made with care and attention, items tasted cooked from scratch and the buffet table was replenished very well.  Given the lovely setting and variety of dishes the price is reasonable and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Review of the Continental Breakfast buffet.
I am a huge fan of the Old Mill Inn's lunch buffet.
Amazing food, tons of choices, tons of dessert etc.
The Continental buffet breakfast was so so subpar! 
$17 and not even 1 hot option.
A day later I had a breakfast buffet at Blue Mountain resort for $16 and it was much much better. They (Blue Mountain resort) had scrambled eggs with cheese, tater tots, bacon and sausages, plus tons of fruit
And other stuff. 
Even the fruit at the Old Mill was subpar. 
Very disappointed with it. If it was good I would return for breakfast but never again."}

{"text":"********Christmas Dinner 2013**********

This was our 4th year at The Old Mill for our Family Christmas Dinner on Dec 25th.

In the past, it has been an enjoyable experience but this year it was a total disaster from beginning to end!  

-  We waited in line for 30 minutes to be seated.
-  We were finally seated, ordered drinks and some of our party had food.  As the server arrived with our drinks,  an older man came to our table, yelling at us and the staff that we were at the wrong table and had to move immediately! He scared the 6 year old in our party and drew the attention and stares of the patrons around us. We were totally shocked and embarrassed!  At that point, we should have left because it didn't get any better!
-  After being placed at a new table, we then waited in the hot food line for 20 minutes, only to find half of the dishes were empty.
-  By the time we ate the little food we had, both hot food lines extended the length of the restaurant  (approx. 60 or more people per line).   We decided to wait until the lines subsided.  Big mistake!  We waited another 30  minutes at which time the lines were still quite substantial.  We decided enough was enough and asked for our bill.

I want to be very clear that the servers were attentive and did their best in a ridiculous situation.  

However, the Old Mill quite clearly has a serious logistics problem and were not able to handle the amount of guests that they had seated.    Our family will definitely not be back!!!!!  This was the most miserable dining experience EVER!!!"}
{"text":"We reserved this hotel because we wanted to stay someplace nice and not your average hotel. They did not disappoint. We had a little mix up with our room and the front desk staff listened to our concerns and made things right without question. Our room was spectacular, with turn down service each night. Staff was very nice and helpful. Room was extremely quiet, which is exactly what we were looking for. The hotel grounds were incredibly beautiful. The continental breakfast was included with our room, and was quite tasty. Ample parking and within walking distance to Bloor street shops and restaurants. Easy to get to various places for sightseeing too. Overall, would highly recommend this place and will definitely stay here again when we return to Toronto!"}
{"text":"The restaurant - for Sunday brunch - gets a 2/5. I was very disappointed in the variety and quality of food compared to other high-end brunch places. This is definitely not worth the cost. The restaurant had minimal breakfast options, the asian dishes lacked flavour and there was way too many salad and dessert options compared to mains. I would not recommend this place for a special occasion. However, the spa is fantastic! We'd go back for a massage but nothing else."}
{"text":"I got  married here, and whilst a beautiful venue, the staff is so rude.  Once you pay the deposit, it all goes downhill.
Do not book this place!  
Michael, the GM, promised a credit for overcharging us for a room we didn't book, but has failed to respond as promised.  
Brides, go elsewhere!  There are other beautiful sites in Toronto, and places that understand customer service.  seriously!"}
{"text":"1) Sunday brunch is one of the best i've experienced.  They have a wide range of selections and the food is tasty.  Dress code is classy.  There are mostly middle age people at this place.
2) The Spa experience could have been better.  I spent the whole day there with a few of my friends and the products they use are good stuff, but the staff were more interested in reading your wallet to see if you will purchase products after the spa treatments.  If you look like a person that don't have money they don't attend to you much.  If you look like you have money they will pamper you and even provide samples for you to purchase products."}
{"text":"I came here for the Sunday Dinner Buffet. What a lovely place. I love the old interiors. The food was lovely with plenty of options for seafood salads, anti pesti and deli and cheese platters. The mains were slightly lacking in variety as each side of the carving stations had the exact same foods, but they were still tasty. The desserts were very nice as well. Service was spectacular. Would definitely recommend. The Father's Day dinner buffet was 42.95 per person."}
{"text":"I can only review the spa as it's the only service I received on my visit there recently. 
In fact I only had a facial. However,I am compelled to write a review as it was the best facial I ever had!
I am a very fair-skinned irish gal, prone to redness and blotchy patches.
I left there looking like a brand new, shiny-faced baby!
Even better, I woke up the next day after with a beautiful, even, radiant complexion. I'm going back. I'm a HUGE fan!
To top it off the service was impeccable, the facilities top notch and the price ($99) better that some crappy places downtown.
I plan on somehow squeezing this into my budget on a regular basis! 
You have to go!"}
{"text":"The Lunch Buffet is good.  However, I would stay away from accepting their Restaurant Credit Voucher / Gift Certificates.  I was way overcharged one time and was given a Credit Voucher to use at a future time. When I returned to redeem it, it was pretty much useless and nowhere near the amount of it's value! They add tax and gratuities THEN deduct the Voucher.  My $25 worked out to only $12 by the time they were all said and done!!  Also one of the male waiters (Eastern European accent) smelled so bad of body odor that I couldn't take it anymore.  The Pakistan waiter is very unfriendly - acts like he doesn't like his job or people in general.  The male who cuts the Roast beef is very friendly.  His disposition made up for the others who are not polite/friendly."}
{"text":"Just spent the first night of our honeymoon at this hotel,  It is amazing we came here on a group deal and they still gave us an upgrade to a larger suite,  The room was stunning, the free breakfast in the morning was delicious.  And we both left feeling relaxed and very refreshed.  

Thanks so much to the staff there."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for afternoon tea in the Tea Garden. The inn and restaurant are just beautiful and the food was amazing. The service was great and people were very friendly. There isn't a very big selection of teas compared to other places I've been to, but the choices are all very good.  We had 4 different kinds of tea at our table and all were very good. And everyone got a box of Old Mill signature tea to take home. We're already planning a lunch date here one day soon!"}
{"text":"I had Easter brunch with my family today at the Old Mill.  Right off the bat, they use several rooms for seating, it would be a nice touch to have someone at the door to let people know which room is where, many confused people standing waiting to talk to the hostess.  
The room our party was seated in was the Brule room.  If there were ever bad acoustics in a restaurant this one tops them all.  You  could barely hear people sitting next to you.  They had so many tables out that it was awkward making it to the buffet.  The room was so packed that even the servers didn't make it to our table once to refill our water, I did it myself.
Most of the food was good, not excellent.  For $50 per person before tax and tip I would have expected something special.  No prime rib, no lobster, no seafood chowder just what you would expect at an ordinary buffet.  
The Old Mill is definitely a landmark not to be missed however miss the buffet and the Brule room."}
{"text":"Review for Afternoon Tea  (early January 2015)

Here's another overdue review, but thought I share this because it was a great experience.

The Old Mill is located away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  Easily accessible by car with free parking and located just steps from the Old Mill subway station. The cottage-like building is very visible and you cannot miss it.

Upon entering, unless you know exactly where you're going, The Old Mill is like a myriad of mazes with multiple floors and many rooms.  My thought as I was trying to find the main dining room was this place would be great for hide and seek.

I was a little disoriented because it has been quite some time since I last came here, but located the Dining Room shortly after.  The hostess brought me to the Tea Room where my friends were already seated.  We had the corner table which overlooked the lovely garden terrace - even during the winter it looked lovely.

The staff were very friendly, attentive and seemed like they all helped one another, so we received exceptional service that Sunday afternoon by everyone.

The Old Mill celebrated their Centennial year in 2014, so offered a Centennial afternoon tea menu, plus we each received a souvenir Centennial box of teas to take home which was a very nice touch.

We had one gluten-free friend who was in our party, so I confirmed with the server since I indicated the fact when I made the reservation and he assured us that would not be a problem, there would be one gluten-free serving for us - I think they forgot to tell him.

There were 10 tea selections to choose from which was plenty for everyone's preferences.  Tea service was served shortly after we placed the tea selections and then the tiered platters arrived perhaps 10 minutes later.  Definitely timed well, so we had no complaints.  The server was even comical and made the tea experience an enjoyable one.

The finger sandwiches consisted of:
- Smoke salmon with asparagus and fine herb cream cheese Pinwheel
- Mini egg salad croissant with bibb lettuce and tomato 
- Cucumber, baby watercress and fine herb cream cheese open faced sandwich

Tea pastries consisted of:
- Currant and lemon scones served with imported Devonshire cream along with Greaves jams and marmalade
- Lemon meringue tartlet
- Scottish shortbread
- Battenburg cake
- Chocolate dipped strawberry

All the sandwiches were delicious and very mouth-watering that I wanted more. Scones were flaky and buttery and the Devonshire cream was divine.  We asked for more and the server was happily to comply with no hassle and even brought more than enough.

The only thing we didn't like was the Battenburg cake because of the mushy texture.  Essentially, it was sponge cake with jam - not appetizing at all, plus I'm not a big fan of sponge cake (so a bit biased).

The Old Mill definitely had a smaller selection than some other afternoon tea services, but for $29.95, it was a very good value and the service was exceptional.

The staff refilled our teapots with hot water without us asking and long after we finished our food.  We were definitely not rushed out as the staff were setting up for their dinner service.  Yes, we stayed that long (way after tea service ended at 5pm), plus we were one of the last two tables that remained.

Overall, a very enjoyable afternoon with good food and exceptional service, so I would highly recommend venturing to the west end of the city and experiencing a traditional afternoon tea."}
{"text":"We went there for afternoon tea today. The earl grey tea had NO bergamot in it, and this was confirmed by the server. How could they serve it claiming it was earl grey when it clearly wasn't! Not only that, the food was disgusting. The lemon meringue tarts smelled of egg- needless to say, we did not eat it. The shortbread, was not Scottish at all- it tasted of flaky cookie dough. Service- awful! We had to ask 3 different people for lemon before we even got it. Also had to wait 10 minutes for our tea pots to be filled with boiling water! Save your money- old mill sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"Stay away..stay far, far away! Too bad there is no zero star rating. 

Was here for a wedding last weekend. The venue is very nice. The rooms are spacious as are the bathrooms. Everything was clean.

The service during dinner was atrocious. The serving staff was rude and impatient. They rushed people, took milk, cream, sugar, etc...off the table as people were drinking their coffee. The vegetarian food (pasta) was lukewarm and overcooked and without any flavour. 

A waitress asked me to move my walker to the other side of the room. It didn't occur to her that it was needed for WALKING purposes and I wouldn't be able to fly back to my seat! Then the waitress said: \"But it's going to interfere with my serving food\"....to which I replied..\"that's okay, it doesn't bother me\"..she really pissed me off! They obviously need sensitivity training. 

Breakfast was included in the room price. Continental breakfast. I've seen better breakfasts at Holiday Inn Hotels. This was the worst hotel breakfast I have ever had. Lukewarm coffee, two kinds of bread, jam, some cheese and some pastries. Oh..and boiled eggs. 

The room staff and other staff we encountered were very nice and helpful.  The hotel itself is dark and looks like it's seen better days.

I will certainly not return and will discourage anyone else from doing so."}
{"text":"Lovely setting, reasonable wine list (although I wish they had more half bottles),  adequate staff and a lovely meal. I had the lamb shank and it was delicious. Well done. Fell right off the bone! Price was reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"The Sunday dinner buffet was bad. First, there weren't many different dishes to choose from. Second, the food was not tasty. Third, lobsters was the only dish that was a more expensive one but they were small and tasteless. They didn't have smoked salmon. mussels or clams. Fourth, They served cheap and low quality items. Fifth, the desserts were very very sweet and the cheese tray contained some cheap cheeses.

I felt cheated and ashamed to take my relative there. When I called to make the reservation, the one who answered the phone told me that there would be lobsters and crabs. Well, the only crabs that I could see was a bowl of imitation crab meat which has no taste at all."}
{"text":"Was there for the Christmas Day Brunch.  Very disappointing.  Hot buffet items were not hot enough.  (Thought - Food poisioning anyone??) Selection was limited.  The plum pudding that I love could gave been used for a basket ball as it was so rubbery. Best part of the meal was the coffee, but not worth $60. per person + $12.00 parking. Will not be back.  Though that my husband and I could celebrate an upcoming major wedding anniversary there, but the food is not good enough for our guests."}
{"text":"I headed over to The Old Mill Inn for an afternoon tea with my mom.  I knew about their popular afternoon tea and despite the Inn being located close to my home, I haven't made a visit until just recently.  The Old Mill Inn's customary English Tea service has been enjoyed by many since 1914 and it combines traditional favourites and contemporary flavours.

We were seated in The Terrace part of the restaurant, where you could see the beautiful garden through the large windows.  We got there a few minutes earlier so it was empty (perfect to take pictures) but it wasn't long until the space quickly filled up.  

Our server told us they usually have a full afternoon tea service on Saturdays & Sundays, so if you're thinking of going, make sure to make reservations!

Our tea choices:
Darjeeling Mim - Wonderful muscatel highlights with a delicate strength.
Queen Mary - Bright coppery colour, good flavour tempered with flowery character and malty notes.

Our Sweet & Savoury Treats:

- Smoked Salmon, Cucumber & Fennel Cream Cheese, Black Olive & Sun Dried Tomato Tapenade with Watercress Seedlings
- Mushroom & Sweet Onion Tartlet
Lemon & Raspberry Tart 
- Almond Shortbread
- Mini Carrot Gateau 
- Currant and Lemon Scones
- Imported Devonshire Cream 
Greaves Jams and Marmalade

As I expected, everything about our afternoon tea was wonderful.  We both enjoyed our time there chatting over tea and delectable savoury & sweet treats.  Although it was a busy afternoon, the servers were attentive and friendly.  With it's affordable price tag at $24.95 (weekends; $19.41 mon-fri) compared to other hotel tea times in the City, I definitely want to come back soon!"}
{"text":"In response to Natalie B.'s response to my review:

Thank you Natalie for your message.  However, I believe you're mistaken.  I was never offered a complimentary service.  Perhaps you are thinking of someone else who made a complaint?  I was offered a $25 discount on my next appointment.  It's this sort of disorganization and confusion that I alluded to in my comment on Yelp. I understand your position, as an employee of the spa, but I feel I have a responsibility to share my opinion and experience with the general public as I wouldn't want them to have the same experience that I had.  I've actually visited the facility since, and have seen the massage rooms, and stand behind my comment on the decor.  I also lived in England for quite sometime, and although the Inn itself is a breathtaking landmark and true to its English roots, the spa's decor is another thing. I hope that you will find my comments constructive, and that your Director will addresses them when training employees and consider them in his/her management of your group.
Best,

{"text":"Came for afternoon tea. Lovely selection of sandwiches and scones and sweets. I wish there had been more sandwiches and less sweets but that might just be personal preference. There was no cream for the scones even though it was on the menu. This was a major disappointment as it was what I was most looking forward to. Also we were seated late and for the majority of our meal the staff were cleaning up a large table next to us."}
{"text":"This review is for high tea at the Old Mill. 

Took my friend to high tea on a Monday as part of his birthday celebration(he's been to most in T.O except Old Mill). Tried to make reservations by leaving a message but never heard back from anyone. I wasn't too worried as it was a Monday and I really didn't think it would be overly crowded. To ensure that we would get a spot, we got there 10 minutes before 3pm. When we arrived we were told that we had to wait until 3pm. Not a problem we sat in the waiting area until 5mins after 3. The whole time we could see and hear the hostess. She never came to get us or even acknowledged that we were sitting in the waiting area. When we approached her, she asked if we had reservations. We said no and she said \"we usually take reservations to ensure we have the tea ready but I think I can squeeze you in today, let me check\". ???  While she went off to check another hostess, named Jessica, came and quickly asked us if we had reservations. I told her that the other hostess has already taken care of us, to which she replied \"no, do you have reservations?\" I told her no, because no one called me back. She said \" I don't think you called because I would have called back. Here is the number to the direct line for next time. When did you call?\"  I told her I called Thursday and she said \" oh, well just call the direct line next time.\" Really? Next time? Luckily for her, it was my friend's birthday and I really didn't want to argue. The other hostess came shortly after and we were seated. 

After the hurdles we had to go through to get a table, we were expecting that the tea room would be full of guests. When we got in, we were the only ones in the tea room. Anna, our server, came promptly to take our order and we were served our tea and pastries within 5 minutes.  The tea selection was ok but not huge. The pastries were decent for the price but definitely not Windsor Arms or King Edward pastries. 

The service was excellent. Anna was extremely friendly and sweet. She took good care of us the whole time and our pots were never emptied. We were there for the full tea service from 3pm - 5pm. For the first hour, we had the whole tea room, and Anna, to ourselves. Two additional groups (5 guests in total) came between the hours of 4pm-5pm. Anna took care of the whole tea service and served 3 tables the whole afternoon.  Thanks for \"squeezing us in, hostess\".  

Some last words:
- make sure you make reservations with a real live person 
- parking is $2 an hour. There's a T.O park less than a 5 minute walk across the mini-bridge. If the weather is nice, I suggest parking your car there for a walk before tea ;) 
- Windsor Arms serves high tea during the weekday as well"}
{"text":"Not my kind of place. 

Came here for Sunday brunch to celebrate my father in law's 65th birthday.  Apropos, as almost everyone there was 65+.

The place itself is quaint, reminiscent of an olden-timey inn which would be perfect for romantic wedding photos.  I think that's what most people come here for anyway - there's a Wedding Garden, rustic bricks and doors and all around charming style.

I guess it's the antique style ambiance that you pay for, because the food isn't the greatest.  Set as two buffet stations in the main area/pagoda-type spot, these stations are actually mirror images of a single buffet.  Meaning that basically, you're offered one station of hot foods and one salad bar with cold foods - these service tables are doubled within the same spot, but they're also serving the same food items. Why not more variety? 

The roast beef, when brought out straight from the oven, is served medium-rare at one end and well-done on the other.  Knowing this golden tidbit of info, the regulars rush to the table when a new slab of beef is served, so your only chance of getting one of those coveted slices is to eye the salad table, pretending to be highly interested in the pickled herring with sour cream (actually, not bad) and then swarming in like beef is your commission at first opportunity.

Other offerings of the day: your usual cheeseboard (with single-cream Brie, ew, anything less than double cream is sacrilege), a deli platter, a pale arugula with blue cheese and strawberry salad, lettuce with olives and stuff on the side for a DIY garden salad, a wheatberry with cranberries mix, smoked salmon, mussels (quite good, large and plump, maybe they're the Salt Spring sort?) with bits of \"Asian sauce\" (please do not ask me what that is, I have a sinking feeling that Urban Dictionary will not give me the answer I want to know), little baby shrimps in a sort of salad, some tiny, shell-on shrimp beside a large bowl of cocktail sauce, and some bread plus rather dry pastries.

On the hot items end, aside from the roast beef with gravy, resides a roast pork (skipped by most diners as it looked like a clump of fat), roast lamb, Boursin cheese mashed potatoes, bacon, scrambled eggs, waffles, blintzes, and umm...umm... I guess nothing very memorable.

Tea & coffee are included in the $35 per diner price.  To be fair, I overheard an elderly lady loudly state \"The food is NO GOOD today, I tell you. I have nothing good to say about the food AT ALL.\"  Heh heh. 

Service was nice and friendly.  The gentleman serving the beef was jovial and eager to dole out slices cut to order.  The waitstaff clearing plates and offering drinks were clearly and understandably tired on the busy long weekend Sunday, but always remained positive and helpful.  

I'm just not feelin the food."}
{"text":"Review strictly for the Sunday Brunch Buffet.  

I've been wanting to hit the Old Mill Restaurant for Sunday brunch for years now as I've been here for wedding and baptism receptions throughout the years.  Situated along the Humber River, the Old Mill is unique and an interesting departure from other hotel properties in Toronto(technically Etobicoke).  

Arrived and was seated promptly.  This restaurant is massive and quite beautiful.  The cold food was laid out on round tops while the hot food what in the typical buffet chafing dishes.  The hot items had about 12 chafing dishes split in the middle with an offering of ham, waffles and roast beef.  6 dishes per side and identical to the other.  What a let down.  

All the cold dishes I sampled were good.  Salad, cold cuts, pickled herring, smoked mackerel, crab salad, seafood medley, cheese and breads.  Lots of pasta salads and other type salads that looked tasty.  

With this buffet advertising lobster as part of the buffet i was surprised to learn that the lobster was served cold.  The lobster was dry and not edible.   

The only hot items that actually tasted good were the breakfast items that any line cook should be able to make with ease.  Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage were all good.  

Mini waffles were made in abundance and left under a hot plate to dry out.  No whipped butter available to add before the addition of maple syrup.  The Roast Beef was dry and bland.  A chicken dish that was pitiful.   I didn't know it was possible to dry out chicken thighs, but it is.  The salmon in lobster sauce was bland as could be.  

The desserts I sampled were all good with the exception of what I assume was a blintz stuffed with ricotta and topped with mixed berries.  It looked great and tasted awful.  The cheesecake, chocolate and pecan flan(not sure what made this a flan as opposed to a pie)  bread pudding, apple crisp were all good.  I would have loved some ice cream to go with some of these dishes.  

Overall the service was exceptional.  The room was beautiful and at a price tag of $34 per person not including drinks the food should have been on point.  If you are ok with nibbling on cold items than you will enjoy this.  Otherwise avoid.

I won't be returning for the brunch buffet.  They do offer a dinner buffet but based on this experience I most likely won't attempt.  

I really wanted to love this but I didn't.  What a shame."}
{"text":"4.2 stars\". 
Friendly staff and very personal service - from the first time on. Have very experienced full time RMT staff which can get to know your body if you are regular. Credit for great and well maintained facility even is old. Great waiting room area with refreshing cucumber water - knows how to add details. Never feel push or rush. Thumbs up!  

Tell them what you expect and they will excel for you. Complaints will get heard. 

Return - yes!"}
{"text":"First time visiting Old Mills and I am not a fan.

The historical feel of the building and scenery was beautiful but that was pretty much the extent of my positive experience.

Upon arriving at the door, my family was rudely attacked by the hostess as she raised her voice while giving us attitude on what we should have done when arriving to their restaurant instead of calmly explaining any issue that she may have had with us. Considering it was our first time at this establishment, it was fair for us to not know of any procedures that they may have wanted to put in place. After calming her down, she completely ignored our existence and didn't even bothered to apologize, forcing us to find a table ourselves. The initial impression basically ruined the rest of the experience for me. The food was fresh and nicely presented but the taste was mediocre. 

Considering that this is a more high end and well known establishment, I expected better service than I would get at a fast food restaurant. In my opinion, the main purpose was to sell an experience, and this is one experience I would not want to relive again."}
{"text":"Great place to get married. The place is grand, inviting, in the heart of the city and best of all, does not look like a wedding factory. Very flexible and helpful staff. Every room has character and the grounds are beautiful."}
{"text":"Old Mill is a great place for any special occasions (or not so special). Beautiful old style buildings... great patio with fountain and flowers around. Good food.
It was my second time here. First time couple of years ago during our corporate Christmas party.Lots of fun .This time it was a wedding of our friends. Great place for it. We really enjoyed it. The room was decorated with white tables and beautiful orange flowers. Nice Chapel, a bit small if you are planning a big wedding, but it was enough for about 100 people. The reception room was the perfect size for the wedding of 140 people. Service was great as well...very friendly and efficient.  
Salad and steak/chicken that we had were actually really good. Steak was so fresh and juicy.. chicken was perfectly balanced with some potatoes on a side...very filling...
After all that we also had our desert, which was a white chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce..great combination..
Loved it. Fun time!"}
{"text":"*Review of Dinner*

WOW! Didn't know this little piece of Shakespeare was in the city (and by that, I mean the Tudor style of the Inn and the little fake river that could be Stratford-Upon-Avon!)

I took the subway and Old Mill Station was it. A 3 minute walk down picturesque homes and lush trees and there is the Old Mill in all its charmingness. There was a marriage happening and I can imagine some awesome pictures being taken. We have the bridges and the forest-like trees and the overall Jane-Austen-forest- ambiance.

My parents and I decided to walk around a bit and take pictures. Then we sat at the patio and had a bottle of white. How lovely. I wasn't expecting much of the food, but WOW, it actually is delish! Because the air was hot and muggy, we decided to have our dinner in the main dining room, but by the atrium-like room with all-around windows to take advantage of the light and scenery. I had the Tuna Poke for app which was excellent and YUM; refreshing and tasty. Perfect for a hot summer day. Then, because of all the 4 days of swimming I did during the week, I ordered the Veal Chop to feed my ravenous hunger. A crispy skin with juicy and tender meat inside. YUM! No skimpy portions here as the veal was the size of my head.

We couldn't pass up desserts so we had the cheesecake and 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. Nothing to cry over, but it was a perfect ending. Service was great. Wines are very decently priced such that we were able to order two more bottles of a decent Pinot without batting an eye.

So, yes, I get why this place is popular for special occasions, weddings, date nights, brunches, etc...It really combines great ambiance and great food.

Can't wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"Not the high tea experience we were expecting. The food tastes good and the service is efficient, but it has a warehouse feel about the way it's delivered. No explanation of what is being presented and the tea is fairly week. The good high tea locations understand that it's the whole experience and not just the food."}
{"text":"2.5 for afternoon tea.

I've been to the Old Mill several times over the last 18 years: for weddings, the Sunday buffet, business presentations but mostly for afternoon tea. Afternoon tea was awesome when I first started going as a child with my parents, but it's been sliding downhill the last few times I've been with friends. Here are a couple of things our party was disappointed with in our latest visit:

- it was for my birthday -- which doesn't mean anything now, no special treats or extras! Years ago they brought out my dessert with a candle. 
- over the phone we were told our reservations were for 3pm but when our party got there we were told the tea room would not be open until 3:30pm!
- the tea room was PACKED! It was as noisy as a school cafeteria. I have never been there with so many people crammed into that room. The tea service flowed into the main dining room...that's how many people were there for tea!
- we requested more devon cream because what we got was not enough to frost a cupcake...we were told it would be $1.25 extra if we wanted another dollop! (Luckily our server was pretty cool and gave us one on the side with a wink)
- the food was OK but the sandwiches could use some work. The watercress sandwich felt like I was eating a dry salad between two slices of bread.

One more concern to add for anybody who is considering booking a large party for tea, about two years ago my friend's mother-in-law booked a bridal shower for her and specifically requested that our party be seated in the tea room overlooking the gardens. We were guaranteed the tea room. When we arrived early to set-up we were shocked to find our party had been moved into the main dining room. Even though we were adjacent to the tea room it was so dark in our section!! We raised a fuss with the manager but were told they would not seat us in the tea room unless we could guarantee to be out of there in less than two hours because they had to set-up for a dinner event. Seriously???No apologies were made at any point."}
{"text":"Super disappointing. We came here because it was supposed to have a good high tea and wanted to treat Mum for Mother's Day. 

When I saw the menu I asked if I could skip one of the salmon sandwiches for more of the other kind because I was vegetarian. The woman asked if I'd ordered ahead and when I told her I hadn't, she flat out refused to help me. It wasn't like I was asking them to make me something new other than what they already ordered. She wasn't even kind about it. Definitely not the kind of service I'd expect at an establishment or price point that they were offering. 

The tea they had on offer was 70% flavored tea with saccharine sweet flavors like \"creme brûlée\" - very few traditional teas you'd expect at an actual high tea. It appeared they were catering to the tastes of tourist trash. 

The food came out immediately - literally as soon as we sat down - which infers there's some kind of mass production happening behind the scenes. 

Nothing was presented to us, just dropped on the table. 

No one was around to bring us the cheque or help us after. 

The whole experience is was terrible. Such a shame, because the setting was actually really lovely. 

Everything came out immediately, no explanation of what it was. Food was beyond average and the service was terrible!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here (May 4, 2014 -- a week early) for Mother's Day. It baffles me how crowded the tables are (does the Fire Marshall ever visit this place). The food is ok and pricing is comparable for a nice brunch ($50 per person, plus drinks and tips). Parking is always terrible here,especially so now that they build condos in the area.  Come at least 15 minutes to look for parking and to walk to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Old Mill Inn, New Years Eve: Round 2!

This year we opted for the King room, which also had the jacuzzi and fireplace goodness of last year's room. This room was definitely as relaxing as last year's, if not more. The staff was stellar, as usual.

The Vinyl 95.3 NYE party was extremely well organized, the dinner was mostly amazing, and the music was perfect. The room was never too crowded, even on the most popular dancing songs, the dance floor was never too congested. The 95.3 host was even nice enough to go around to each table and make sure the attendees were having a great time. The free champagne and wine was much appreciated too!

We decided upon arrival that we were going to do 2 nights instead of our original 1, but we opted for a double bed room because it was less expensive. Because check-out was 2pm, and check-in is 4pm, they and we had concerns that there would be a 2 hour window in which we would be without a room, but the Old Mill staff said they'd try their best to make the switch smooth. Once we were approaching 2pm on the second day, I placed a call downstairs to find out that they decided to make all of our lives easier, by allowing us to remain in the King room at no extra cost. Savings of 150 dollars! Not as much of a saving as when we were upgraded from the Vinyl party to the Gala party last year, but incredible nonetheless! I just love the staff here to death. I hope they send out one of those satisfaction survey things, as I plan on letting them know just how amazing their staff has been to us (Jennifer and Brad in particular), and that we can't wait to return.

And their breakfast buffet does bacon and eggs like nobody's business!"}
{"text":"Came here recently for Sunday brunch, as it's one of the only places in Toronto that does a nice buffet on the weekend.  It also has some nice historical aspects to it. The place is big and a tad confusing - for the record, you can enter the restaurant to the right of the hotel's main door and not walk through the whole hotel in a circle as we did.

Reservations, I assume, are accepted but we did not have one and had no problem being seated.  We actually got a nice table close to the buffet.  The place has a very old theme to it, even somewhat medieval.

Service was pretty good although sometimes it went from attentive to nowhere to be found.  In the end, our female server eventually made her way back to us and I suspect she was very busy.

Food was good!  Lots of options from salads to breads to hot items.  I feel there were a couple of 'misses' for Sunday brunch that could be incorporated:  an omelette station and juice included with the meal.  Otherwise, value for quantity/quality is excellent - there are a ton of options.

We would definitely do this again.  Or maybe try their Sunday dinner option.  Oh and one last side note, we both wore shorts and felt a tad under-dressed.  I would recommend wearing somewhat decent clothes for brunch - it appears everyone else does.  :)"}
{"text":"Pro: beautiful scenery
Hot food was actually hot. 
Nice server

Cons: 
Stressed out hostess & supervisor for their \"stressful\" job
If you are not in a seat, you will be attacked
Watch out for the cheese cake, not chilled...
Small buffet area, lots of crowding. 
No air conditioning/ air circulation 

Beautiful establishment. But please do not go there for brunch. 

Their staff is under such extreme stress and \"pressure\" that as soon as I walked through the door, hostess lady screamed \"if you have a reservation, please GET IN LINE\"(no more than 12 people at the front desk). Not off to a good start. As I walked passed her to find  my family members who already had a table, an older gentlemen aggressively asked if I knew where I was going... I didn't have a floor plan of this restaurant, but I knew the general direction.  He then immediately stormed off mumbling god knows what.

Fortunately the table server was extremely nice and the food was decent. But not 52 dollars decent. 39 base fee + mandatory 18% tip and standard 13% tax. But it doesn't stop there... we got another uplift in charge because we had one extra person join us for brunch not part of the initial reservation. 

Just to be clear, price is not an issue. But I can't justify paying good money for sub-par service."}
{"text":"What a place.  Posh and expensive.  However if you like to be pampered with good service and excellent food then you dont mind paying a bit extra to be here in an upscale environment.  It was birthday time again in our family and the lucky lady decided she wanted to try the Old Mill.  Good choice.  It was above excellent.  I would suppose its not for everyone because they cater to a more refined pallet and we appreciate that more than i can express in a simple review.  We arrived shortly after 6 and the only complaint i had was the parking is in a public lot across the street, but other than that, its all good.  We entered through the hotel and walked along the hallway to the restaurant on this chilly evening but enjoying the classic charm of this old place.  Congrats on the Old Mill on the 100th anniversary by the way.  Upon arrival we were greeted by the Maitr'd and seated by the window overlooking the courtyard.  The wait-staff attending to our table were very pleasant, and at first we thought a bit straight forward but when they realized we were having fun as a group they seemed to adapt to the mood of our table and that was a bonus in our eyes.  We ordered some beverages to get started then took a look at the menu, followed by the chef's specials.  After some discussion, 4 out of 5 decided on the Beef Tenderloin, and one for the duck, with a soup of the day starter.  Now, i must say, i managed to sneak a taste of the soup, and the amount of seafood in there made this one very tasty and hearty soup and it was served in a bread bowl, but hey, i was already snacking on the bread at the table, and as i said, it wasnt my soup to begin with :) so a taste was all i could manage.  Somewhere as we chatted, they repleneshed the bread, because i looked over and the basket was full again.  They dont have to be told and you dont have to ask, they just take care of you, and thats what we like.  The water glasses were always being filled, the coffee cup seemed to replenish itself also.  They were on top of their game on Saturday night.  Finally, after a bit of a leisurely wait, our meals arrived.  At this point I noticed the place really seems to be filling up, so its quite a popular spot. 
     Now to say the tenderloin was good would be an injustice, the reduction that the the beef was cooked in was unique and flavorful and the beef itself was tender and cooked to a perfect medium, the side dish (which is extra) was your choice of many different options so a few of us chose the fingerling potatoes and a few chose the carrots and parsnips and for my son, he had the mac'n cheese.  Now this Mac'n cheese was something elevated above anything i have ever had.  I was impressed, and the fingerling poatoes were a bit of heaven, even good reviews from across the table about the veggies, so all was spot on so far.  As the main course came to an end, my son asked for the unfinished mac & cheese to be packed to take home, and just a cool foot note, they did a neat foil take home container with a handle which we found quite amusing and unique.   Now comes the desert, it was somebodys birthday and they brough this wonderful sampler of desert delights with a candle and the presentation was beyond our expectations.  A quick round of happy birthday fromt he serving staff and our fellow diners applause made this another cool moment for us with the attention from our serving staff.  i cant even pronounce this but i had Valrhona Chocolate & Dulce De Leche Tart and this may be the best desert i have ever had, and as a chocolate lover that is a huge complement to the desert chef.  As for the others who enjoyed the Tiramisu and other treats provided by this fine restaurant, i can only say that its possible we shall return for the next special occaision.  It may not be for everyone, but if you want to treat yourself and are ready for something special then its a great place to visit.  I can see some people are not prepared for the price or are used to something a bit more bland so its not for everyone, but for those of us who appreciate food as an art and fine service as a profession, then this is an experience worth the price.  It was a delight and a pleasure to visit the old mill and i wish i could give you more than 5 stars for making this occaision such a memorable one."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's wedding. 

This is a beautiful place for a wedding, and they have the most memorable and friendly banquet staff I've ever met. The space itself was old style in a way that made you feel like you were in a Disney movie. Definitely a step above any banquet hall.

Nobody seemed to impressed by the food, unfortunately. I ordered the vegan meal and it was just penne and tomato sauce. 

Other than the food, the place seemed absolutely perfect for a wedding and the photos of the bride and groom taken onsite came out beautifully!"}
{"text":"This wasn't my first time here and previous times I've visited I had nothing bad to say because I had a really good time the last time I came to Old Mill for a wedding. But this weekend when I visited the Old Mill for another friend's wedding, I really believe I will never come back here ever again.  I did enjoy the food, but the overall experience left a bad impression.  First off, I'd like to start with how horrible the catering service was.  When they were serving the salad, one of the waitresses dropped salad onto my lap (luckily, I had the napkin over my lap).  Then, as they went on to serve the main dishes, I was served an enormous piece of salmon with endless amounts of vegetables and a couple of pieces of potatoes, whereas the boyfriend was served a small piece of chicken thigh and a couple of pieces of vegetables.  They were extremely inconsistent with their portion sizes.  Not only that, but they ended up dropping some green beans and carrots outside of my plate which landed on all my cutlery, which I then had to clean off before I began eating.  When served desserts, they had two different selections of desserts but were not able to choose which one we would like, they were just handed to us and most of us at the table ended up switching or sharing the desserts.  After dessert was all done, we were offered coffee.  The boyfriend was offered coffee and the waitress poured it into his cup and as she finished pouring the coffee, some of the coffee somehow landed on my arm and on my dress.  At that point, I was livid because of numerous times food was dropped all over me and on the table throughout the entire night.  When the waitress asked me if there was a problem, the boyfriend explained that she had dropped coffee on my dress and we began to show her the stain she had the audacity to tell me that it was \"just water\" and when I said it was not \"just water\" she then started apologizing.  To end off the night, the Groomsman from the other wedding party in the banquet hall next to us invited us to come have some drinks but the security were refusing to let us have drinks with them at their bar.  Meanwhile, both parties were open bar and we had invited them to come drink with us and they able to have drinks from our party's bar but we weren't allowed to have drinks at their bar.  The Groom was furious and was so upset and we just did not understand the concept behind it.  It was the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.  So if I were you, I'd save the money that you want to spend on a nice wedding venue for somewhere that is worth while and will give you the exceptional service you deserve on your special day!"}
{"text":"This review was for my dinner experience.

My family and I attended the Billy Joel tribute. It was alright. We weren't very pleased with the performance to be honest. We will be back though for the Toronto All star big band and give it another go. 

We really enjoyed the interior and the atmosphere of the restaurant. Everyone looked pretty happy regardless of the music.

This was honestly one of the best services I have received anywhere! The staff are extremely kind.

3 stars because unfortunately, there aren't many vegan or vegetarian options. I did go home hungry that night."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch Buffet
I was sold on the all-you-can-eat lobster so I decided to take my family there for Mother's Day Brunch. Because it was Mother's Day, The Old Mill decided they would jack up the price from $34/pp to $48/pp. When I asked why, they explained that there would be nicer decor and more shellfish. 
My family and I had a very disappointing experience. The lobsters were small (seemed they they were 1lb at the most) and it was just boiled and chilled. It just wasn't very appetizing. The rest of the food selection was just OK. Nothing special (your usually brunch foods such as salads, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, etc.), and definitely nothing out of the ordinary to justify the price tag. It didn't seem like there were any other upgraded shell fish than what you would see on a regular Sunday to justify the increased price. I couldn't even find smoked salmon. The roast beef was over-cooked and chewy. Also, I have no idea what \"upgraded decorations\" they were talking about...
My family and I would've been happier having brunch at Glow Fresh Grill & Wine Bar (at Shops at Don Mills), which goes for $18.99/pp and includes great smoked salmon and an omelette station.
Overall, not a great experience and I would never go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed on my last visit for brunch.They're no longer have lobsters, replaced by mussel.  My favorite salad (vermicelli noodles) not in sight.  Won't return for a long long time."}
{"text":"While the place is a spa, a hotel, a restaurant and so on and so on, this review is only for the brunch.

This place is a really classy place in a sense that it is upscale and it feels upscale.  It's a very old and well known place in Toronto.  There was a sign saying that they were celebrating their 100th year.  That's really impressive...

The building is what it is, a very well kept and classy place.  I feel like I'm in a castle or something when I'm here because it just feels much older than so many other places in Toronto.  The location is nice as well, right by the Humber river and while it's a very popular place I still managed to find a decent parking spot over the bridge.

We had made a reservation for 14 for Thanksgiving brunch.  While I am happier being at home or a family member's house it was somehow agreed that we were going to have Thanksgiving here for my in-law's family.  I really would have preferred having it at our home.  As far as arriving we gave them our name and the hostess basically didn't know where our party was.  Apparently others had arrived but we didn't know where we were seated.  This isn't the type of place you can just go in and look around because it's in different rooms, different floors etc.  The place is pretty big and we had to wait and wait and wait.  We arrived at 130pm which is when the reservation was for but the others perhaps came a little earlier.  Regardless we didn't' get to our table until about 20 minutes later and the others that were at the table had already had a plate.  That was upsetting for me.  Here we go out of the way to go someplace for a family meal and half of them already ate!  Honestly I don't know how you lose a party of 14 in a place like that.  It's big but it's not huge.

Well it's a buffet so the food is ready and the only waiting you are doing is standing in line.  The place was packed.  I had to wait about 10 minutes just to get to the hot food area.  There were stations in the middle of the floor for all sorts of foods like smoked fish, salad, bread, cheeses, and other foods as well.  The line was slow moving for the hot food which they had scrambled eggs, bacon, breakfast sausage, garlic mashed potatoes, chicken breast, turkey dark meat, stuffing, wild rice, lamb t-bones, and other hot food.  At the end of hot food buffet there is a person carving either white meat or prime rib for you.  

I had a little bit of everything which included some breakfast food as well as the meat and sides.  For the kids one of the island stations had chicken strips and fries but beyond that not really anything else for kids that I could see.  They'd be eating the big people food at a place like this.  The cheese tray was OK, nothing really stood out.  It was hard to get any of the blue cheese because all they had was tongs to get at it.  I had wished they had a tray of cold cuts to go with the cheese but they didn't.  

As far as the salads they looked OK but I didn't have any except for the pasta salad and olives.  The fish station looked pretty good and it was.  I had some smoked trout, smoked salmon, smoke mackerel.  They had herring but I didn't feel like having any.  The smoked trout and mackerel seemed cooked already (not like the salmon) but they still were OK but a bit dry.  

The food overall was OK.  The stuffing seemed kind of mushy.  The prime rib was too cooked for my liking.  The killing was the price I think.  I had been here before and it while it's a very rare occasion coming here I can't really say it's worth it.  The food variety is fine but the prices after tax and tip are close to 50 bucks a person.  For that kind of money I can have a real sit down meal as opposed to a buffet.  I think I was more disappointed in the fact that were were having one of our Thanksgiving dinners here instead of at home.  The place was crowded, the food was just ok and the cost was sort of high.  I can't say we'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"***Dining Room Review Only***

Came to Old Mill with Mum B. for my birthday dinner and thought it would be a classy place for two sophisticated ladies to enjoy intellectual conversation over a glass of wine.  Well - the sophistication started and ended with us. The neighbourhood was where you would find \"Old Money.\"

Upon arriving, we noticed that there was apparently a wedding going on.  Just as I was about to pull into the parking lot, the attendant said that it was full and directed me towards a side road which I later found out was street parking along a park.  Again, there was no space.  We are starting to panic a bit because how can you not have parking for your customers?  I come back out to the parking lot where the attendant is, and he is now pointing us in another direction, towards a bridge.  I let Mum B. off first and find myself at another park.  As I pull up to the park, it says No Parking.  I also noticed a lot of people just parked illegally on the streets.  Great - so now I would have to sit through dinner with the thought of getting towed looming over my head.  We later found out that there were about 5 weddings that were simultaneously being hosted at the Old Mill which is why we were all scrounging around like the apocalypse was among us for parking spots.

Logistically, to get to the restaurant, you have to walk through a maze to arrive at the front desk.  My first thought upon entering was how big this place was.  The dance floor and band stage were the focal points of the restaurant.  We were seated promptly next to a girl who was ranting loudly in Italian - picture the way an Italian mother rants at her kids. Some people just have no grasp of what an indoor voice is, nor any idea as to what appropriate social etiquette is.  We are not at a flea market bargaining for goods lady!

I took it upon myself to be reseated as I am not going to compete with an amplifier over dinner and the band that would be coming on later.  It just seemed like we were jinxed that night as nothing seemed to go right.  

The server that was responsible for our table seemed so out of his element.   I am going to call him Slowy Gonzalez as he was obviously of Latin American descent.  Otherwise I could've called him Jabba the Hutt he sludged around as such for the entire evening.  When we spoke to him, he heard the words we uttered but didn't truly listen to what we were saying and we felt shrugged off.

First of all, he was the most inattentive server ever!  It took him a good 10-15 minutes before he even greeted us and took down our drink orders.  We ordered a bottle of Jackson Triggs Sauvignon Blanc.   In the meantime, our water glasses were left empty and it wasn't until we asked that water was brought to the table.  

Our appetizers and bread basket arrived at exactly the same time.  We both got the Quail & Pig which was a grilled quail and roast pork belly with sour yellow plum birch syrup.  The food was cold.  The quail looked so promising as it had a nice brown colour to it, but was rather bland and some parts were not cooked.  The sauce that accompanied it was equally bland.  The only part of that dish that was remotely good was the roast pork belly - reminded me of Chinese BBQ Pork minus the crispy skin.

For mains I ordered the Double Beef Pairing - roast sirloin, oxtail Daube, celery top and root, in a Niagara Port reduction.  The oxtail was quite tender and the reduction was quite savoury as were the vegetables.  The roast sirloin came in a roast beef-like fashion as it was sliced very thin.  Mum B. got the RockHen Barbeque - served with apple cider sweetbreads, collard and kale greens, sweet potato and finished in a MillHouse Barbeque Glaze. From the remnants on her plate, I would conclude that it wasn't very good.

The best part of the meal was dessert which was accompanied by coffee and tea respectively.  We both opted for the Bloody Napoleon - served with a blood orange cream, salty sweet citrus crust and basil syrup.  The puff pastry was airy and sweet.  The blood orange cream was also nice and light.  If there was any basil syrup - I missed it altogether!

Verdict:
The Old Mill is riding off its old reputation and has an old school \"charm\" to it.  It is the sort of place where you find retired couples who want some sort of recreational activity and some nice live jazz music to dine to on a Friday night that would otherwise be spent at home.  Other characters you will encounter at the Old Mill are the cougars.  I saw all sorts of age-inappropriate pieces of cloth being slapped onto out of shape silhouettes parading around throughout the evening.

The service is terrible, and the food is visually appealing deceiving.  I wouldn't come anywhere near this place - even if I'm paying discounted Summerlicious prices.  Their menu sounds so promising but I definitely felt deceived!"}
{"text":"It was our four year anniversary and we couldn't quite afford the vacation we had in mind, so a staycation was just what the doctor ordered! After dining in at a Bloor St West restaurant (Bloom, awesome!) for Winterlicious we walked a bit in the snowfall and took the subway back to the Old Mill Inn. 

We'd already registered earlier in the day, taking advantage of a Sunday Special which reduced the room from $275+ to just around $200 for a King Room with view (a delightfully picturesque view of the Humber Valley River)

Walking down to the hotel is a bit weird, despite being super walkable and accessible, you need to cross a little bridge to get to the Inn, the bridge doesn't even have sidewalks. The cobbles are all loose and scary, it's not meant for those without cars, obviously.

The jacuzzi in the bathroom was probably my favourite thing, the room being actually kind of small (or maybe the bed was just really large...) Dresser space was actually somewhat lacking for such a large room, not that it mattere as we were there one night, but I wondered what a week there would be like.

So, things sound ok, why is this a 3 star review you may ask? Thing is, it's SO DAMN EXPENSIVE you think they'd be able to include things like, oh, complimentary wireless internet? Snacks? I've stayed at less and gotten way more. It seems though, they pride themselves on pricing themselves above and beyond simple standards that other hotels offer without batting an eyelash."}
{"text":"This is a review of Old Mills as a wedding and reception venue from a guest's perspective. (see my lists for more). 

One of the few venues in the City that is subway accessible, and has nature, tons of picturesque spots right on the grounds, and you can have your ceremony and reception all in the same place. 

We had considered this for our own wedding, but I wasn't a fan of the outdoor ceremony area , in the back of the building, although secluded, wasn't really the look I was going for. When we were here for the wedding this time, we went to go find this area to see it first hand, and it was a mission and half, walking all that way. 

The other thing about the place is that it's also a restaurant, hotel and there will be other events happening the same night as yours. Easy for people crash your wedding, or have things stolen (like I saw some hotel guests walk by and TOOK SOME OF THE FAVOURS that were sitting at the table (for the people that didn't show up). It's absolutely rude and so disrespectful makes me hate the human race a little bit.)

Other than that, this venue has been in the business for ever. My parents got married here, and I don't think it's changed one bit. 

When we arrived, the ceremony was taking place in the chapel.  It was a little awkward to gather in the little hallway before entering the tiny door to get to the chapel.  I think it might have been better to seat people as they arrived, rather than waiting and you wonder if you're in the right place or not. 

The chapel is small, so expect some standing room only for those that are having a big wedding. 

After, was some picture taking and cocktails. We had access to the ballroom almost immediately which was nice, and the couple had coordinated someone to get us for photos when it was our turn. The couple ended up taking photos just outside the main entrance on the grassy area. It was nice, and right in front of the house, but not sure if they knew (or were allowed to go) about the fountain and bridge on the other side. Maybe they already had other pics done there. 

The large ballroom (2 of them opened up) was able to fit a huge head table about 14-16 people (their family) on a long rectangle facing the dance floor.  The dance floor was also a good size too. Wooden, and not slippery. 

I am so picky about food and service when it comes to these things. I have to say, the food was very good and no complaints about that at all! Soup, salad, steak/chicken or veggie pot pie, chocolate mouse. 
The service was okay, they were decent. All serving from the same side, but noticed that they would drop the plates down forcefully like throw them on the table, as opposed to placing them. 

After all the formalities, they didn't do much to clear the tables from glasses etc. Which in a way was kind of nice, so I can put my drink down without fear (and waste) that someone would take it. 

Overall, I would have to say it's one of the better venues I've been to. With lots of areas to explore, you'll never feel cramped or bored - but might walk into the wrong wedding at some point."}
{"text":"Today was my first time Officiating a wedding ceremony at The Old Mill and I have to say I'm extremely impressed. This venue is a Toronto landmark and was looking a bit tired, once upon a time but now it's a first class event venue and inn which hasn't compromised on the old world charm it's been famous for over the many decades it's been in business. Now, let me be clear... I do a LOT of weddings at a LOT of venues all over Ontario and the skill and professionalism with which the events are executed are second to none. They run an extremely tight ship here but the personal touch isn't sacrificed in the least. When I arrived in the Royal Oak Room before the ceremony, I was greeted cheerfully BY NAME by Eugene, the captain for our event, who was lighting the candelabras. Eugene carefully explained how he had arranged for this and that... special touches which made my job easier as an Officiant and ensured that the ambiance in the gorgeous, wood paneled room was optimal for an intimate ceremony for 18 people. 
As I was on my way out, I met Brian who I believe is the GM or floor manager and made sure he knew how impressed I was. He proceeded to praise the entire, amazing team (by name) and explained how many of them have been here for several years. I responded by saying that it's clear they all love their jobs... The Old Mill is certainly doing something right :)"}
{"text":"The food was freaking amazing- I went for the lunch buffet- holy crap, so delicious- seafood galore, great meats and vegetables.
- very crowded setting- a lot going on, pretty overwhelming. wouldn't want my wedding here, but a nice brunch experience."}
{"text":"What is this beautiful piece of historical architecture doing in TDot? It belongs on the outskirts of some wine country estate, or close to some mountainous landscape. But nope, here it is. In super flat, very urbanized Toronto (Etobicoke actually), surrounded by highways rather than mountains. 

I came here for a wedding in the summer and one thing really stuck out to me: I felt like I was in a Harry Potter book. No, this isn't a joke about how \"magical\" the whole thing felt because of the power of love etc. etc. No actually, the inside reminds me of Hogwarts. It's got the dark wooden beams and the antique chandeliers. Throw in a few moving staircases and annoying ghosts and you've got yourself a full-out teenage wizard fantasy. 

If we're talking about \"magical\" in the traditional sense, it couldn't be felt more strongly than in the Old Mill wedding garden. It's a lovely little space surrounded by greenery and a raised area for the bride and groom to get married. It was absolutely gorgeous, even if it was a little awkward to get to. There are a lot of stone steps that wind around the building, but it sure was a scenic trip down. The bride had people at several checkpoints along the stone stair path telling us which way to go, like a marathon in dresses where people are telling you you're almost at the finish line! 

Now, my family came in with very low expectations for food, probably because we're biased against Western food at large events. More often than not, the chicken is dry and the veggies are bland. Old Mill blew through those expectations. The beef selection was an impressive 10oz piece that was tender and flavourful. The salmon was moist and covered in a tasty sauce. The only disappointment was the vegetarian option, which was some lasagna type creation that my mom didn't finish. 

I can only imagine this place is good for more than just weddings. They've got hotel rooms, spa services, and general brunch/dinner things going on. I can't speak to those, but if you're planning to a host a wedding, this is a solid consideration! Also great if you want to escape the harsh reality that you never received a letter telling you you're a wizard when you were 11. :'(

{"text":"I have been here twice for a wedding. Unless you rent ou the biggest room with the terrace, the other rooms for weddings are quite small and stuffy. Im not sure if there is new management or something, but the food recently was not fantastic. This place is great for outdoor photos but the chapel is tiny and best for a smaller ceremony. Overall, this place seems a bit dated."}
{"text":"Were going to get married! At first I absolutely dreaded the old Mill...why you ask? Well because I was on my way, in tuxedo (minus socks, Don Johnson was always a fan of mine), and I was minutes away from loosing my freedom as a single man! 
As the sweat beaded down my neck through my collar and \"clip on bow-tie\", I had arrived! Arrived to face my destiny, and to one of the most beautiful places I had ever been to in Toronto. My senses made me believe that this was meant to be. The beautiful English Tudor building seemed like it spanned a mile long. Beautiful flowers, and well manicured perennials surrounded the entire facility. As I walked inside, it was a transformation of new to old. Old might describe many things in a negative fashion, but this was elegance in the old world that many people were lucky to have been on that particular day. The quaint little chapel was glowing with sunlight that had creep through the stained glass windows. At glimpse, all 75 seats were filled with anticipated guests. 
Then we got married...yada yada yada 
The Hall was a split room, but due to the size of our guest-list we took up both rooms. There was a terrace to the back that was filled with flowers, and had a beautiful view of the Hotel portion of the Inn. The room itself contained the old world feel we had become a custom to. Every guest complimented the venue, its service, and of course the happy couple! 
We had dinner, there were speeches.... 
The night was completed.....until we checked into our room. Masterfully planned to accentuate the the hotels glorious views of the Humber river, and gardens. The decor was up to date as far as standards are concerned, and the Champagne with Strawberries completed the touch of a fine hotel. 
The staff was always attentive to our needs, and provided exceptional knowledge of how to treat a guest. 
It was perfect. 
Here's the kicker - we went to book a room for our 1 year anniversary and they didn't want to give us a deal! Whats up with that?! We just spend our soon to have kids education fund on 1 day, and you cant throw us a bone? Not impressed! After-service is an essential component of a successful and long standing business. 
This Inn is a must for people looking for an extraordinary location to be married. As far as coming back...im going to Vegas on my next anniversary!"}
{"text":"Visited Old Mill twice in the span of one week in July after never having been here before. 

1st time: wedding with an outdoor ceremony in the garden followed by a reception indoors. The weather cooperated so the garden ceremony was lovely. The reception was very tastefully decorated and in terms of the food: decent salad app, beef skewer was chewy, chicken entrée was juicy, and chocolate mousse dessert was rich and delicious. 

2nd time: lunch buffet on a weekday at their restaurant ($23 before taxes/tip on Mon-Tues, $28 Wed-Fri). The ambience was elegant but the lights were dimmed too much - given there are some steps/slope to reach the buffet area, you should be very mindful while walking around. The buffet was good in terms of quality but didn't have the variety in terms of mains that I expected - most of the options were salads. My favourite was the chicken in a chunky tomato sauce - super flavourful. 

Parking at the open lot across the street is available for $2/hour."}
{"text":"I visited Toronto from the US and some friends took me to brunch at the Old Mill Inn. I was disappointed with the water-soaked lobster, the so-so maple-glazed ham and even the pretentious scrambled eggs! Neither the food nor the service was very good.

What followed was a little hard to believe: the manager, sporting a green suit and the name tag 'Darren', came over to our table and announced to us three that we have 20 minutes before we have to vacate our table! I had to speak. I informed Darren that I have worked in fine dining restaurants for well over a decade, in Canada and in various places in the US, and that I never heard anything like that in my life. Telling a guest it's time for him to go?! I wasn't even done with my coffee and fruit plate! Darren said that \"It's too bad, but that's the way it is here when we're busy.\" He didn't even seem to think he was being rude or doing something wrong. He said we have to leave near the two hour mark, in about 20 minutes. My friends later remarked we actually had closer to 30 or 40 minutes, since they remembered when we were sat and that Darren was mistaken. Also, we got there at 10:30 AM, which is their opening time, but they asked all the guests to wait because they were not ready to open and so we stood around for 15 minutes. But that is clearly not the point.

I have dined in 4 continents and in dozens of countries and I have never been treated so rudely. I have also worked many double shifts, some with no breaks, and was on the verge of collapse a few times, but I still had to wait until my guests were gone before I could leave, so that I could personally wish them goodnight. That's the way it is in the hospitality business, if you want to succeed that is. Obviously, the Old Mill have no clue what hospitality is."}
{"text":"So I've been putting off doing my 100th review for a while because I wanted to make it a good one, something special. Even though I knew almost immediately what I wanted it to be, it's taken me a while to get around to it because I wanted to get it right...after all, you only get one chance to Yelp! the place you got married!

So where to begin? Now after the whole \"Yes, I will marry you!\" was out of the way (and informing the parents and loved ones) it was prudent to start looking for a place to actually host about a hundred of our closest friends, family and assorted well-wishers for the wedding of the century (well, our century anyways). After checking out a few places in the distillery district, a few golf courses and some very trendy spots, we popped over to The Old Mill after my mum suggested that we should at least check it out. We did...and decided right then and there that this was the place, no need to keep looking. After pricing it out (surprisingly more affordable than we thought) we went with it and couldn't have been happier.

The place itself? Absolutely picturesque. It actually is (or was) an old mill and if there's a nicer place in the GTA to take wedding photos, I can't think of it. Now I'm not going share them here (they're for friends and family, sorry!) but take my word for it: they turned out incredibly and not only because we had an amazing photographer. Just take a walk around the grounds and see for yourself. And even though we had a mid-September wedding and could have done the ceremony outdoors, with a chapel as nice as the one they have, there's no way we could resist. Words can't do it justice so take my word for it: it's perfect. 

We also decided to stay for a couple of nights (it is a hotel as well, after all) and the room was incredible. The Deluxe King Suite, although quite dear, is beyond lovely and all of the wonderful wedding gifts they left us (especially the champagne flutes) were a nice touch. We were so busy and nervous and tired and frazzled though that we probably didn't enjoy it as much as we could have if were even partly relaxed but will definitely look to stay again.
 
As for all of the wedding details and such, pretty much everything went off without a hitch. Our catering coordinator, Kim, was an absolute pro and she worked with us every step of the way to ensure that the most important day of our lives went perfectly (spoiler alert: it did). The food (very good), the room, the day of preparation and the ceremony were all handled so well that I would often have to find things to call and be nervous about when, in fact, everything was pretty much taken care of! Great communication and a great experience all around.

We did have one fairly moderate issue though and I feel I should bring it up.

Being the detail oriented guy that I am, I made sure to book the aforementioned Deluxe King Suite a good eight months before our wedding date. When we checked in and were led to our room, it was absolutely, positively not the Deluxe King Suite and clearly some lesser room. We went to complain and were given some line that the room I had booked eight months prior wasn't available or some such nonsense (I wasn't having any of it) and after complaining rather vocally, it was discovered that they magically DID have a Deluxe King available. Finally when I went to get an explanation (from a third person now) as to why they essentially tried to pull a bait-and-switch on us, I was given some further line that was just more hogwash. In essence they tried to stick us in an inferior room hoping we wouldn't notice, probably because someone with a bigger, more expensive wedding wanted the one we had booked while still trying to charge us for the Deluxe King! I really wasn't happy with any of the three people that I spoke with at the front desk and the way they went about the whole thing was pretty low. I didn't register any sort of complaint at the time even though I should have (I guess because I didn't want it to sour things and all other aspects of the wedding were great) but the whole experience with the room really did leave a bad taste in my mouth.
 
But I'm still giving it a five star review. Like I said, Kim and the catering department were all fantastic to deal with, Reverend Charles was everything we could have wanted in a chaplain, Paolo (our organist) was sublime and the staff on hand (specially props to our awesome bartender, Enrique) were all fantastic. I would absolutely, definitely recommend getting married at The Old Mill without hesitation...just be sure to inspect your guest room first."}
{"text":"We were here on the weekend for a wedding. The garden area and building itself are really nice and large. This place as alot to offer and I love the fact that its so old and looks like it probably did back in the day. Now because we were here for a wedding we didnt see or use the spa/inn but i would like to check this out one day. 

The food they had at the wedding was catered by the place and the hot food was Ok. The dessert was frikkin awesome though! like really good mousse and choc cake, these cannoli treat that tasted like rainbow ice cream with chocloate and so much more. The thing that sucks was the alcohol was VERY expensive. 7.50 domestic btl of beer 8.50 import and 9.50 a glass of house wine...... :O like whoa. The place is pretty though and there are many rooms. There were like 4 other weddings there too and we couldnt hear them at all so that was nice. I will update if i ever go back :)"}
{"text":"This review is for the Afternoon High Tea.  I was excited to try their Afternoon tea b/c I always hear about it and I've tried the various other hotels high tea.

Monday - Thursday the high tea comes with UNLIMTED MIMOSAS.  For $30 you get tea, pastries and unlimited drinks?  No brainer for me.  Make sure you either take the TTC/Uber or are not the designated driver - definitely get your unlimited mimosas onm b/c unfortunately that is the only redeeming thing I can say about this place.

Parking is at the paid lot across the street.  When you walk in, in order to get to the dining room for high tea you have a long way to go.  Luckily there are signs, however when you get to the end, the hostess desk is way over on the other side (not sure how this makes sense...but ).   The hostess was actually super sweet and seated me right away.  I wish I knew her name b/c she was really nice.

If you hope for any service...well..don't get your expectations up.  I sat there for 22 minutes before any one bothered to come over.  22 minutes.  No water, no tea, no even nod or smile in my direction.  I actually had to wave someone over.

If I came here on Fri-Sun and didn't get the mimosas I would be PISSED.  The saddest looking pastries/sandwiches came out.  I was too embarassed to take a photo.  Zero taste, zero creativity, just plain old zero.  A piece of bread with a cucumber on it.  Salmon pinwheel with mayo - no capers, no herbs, no taste.  

Would I came back here?  No.  Not even for the mimosas."}
{"text":"I was just here for a wedding this weekend.  It's a nice venue (I've been here before for high tea as well).  The classic architecture is really pretty, this place is really well run, and extremely busy.  They must have had 3 or 4 weddings, b/c they were rotating through the chapel, one after the other.  My advice is to try to arrive at least 20 minutes before the ceremony starts, b/c this place is a maze!  Even though we arrived at the venue on time, it took us a while to find the chapel, so we missed the ceremony.  

The food was ok, and I agree with Keeley-Ann, the dessert was the best part (ours was tiramisu - yum!)

PS.  the parking is at the back, and there's no parking fee on saturdays, but I think also for the whole weekend."}
{"text":"This food free month of reviews is hard..... And as much as I didn't really want to go into details about my wedding, I think that I don't have much other choice because my yelp reviews revolve around food. I'll do my best to recap the overall experience without getting getting into details.

I didn't think I could afford a wedding at the old mill.. Thought it was glamorous and upscale, but my husband just told me to take a look at the packages and to my surprise, they were quite affordable and fit the bill. Please be reminded that you have to priorities your must haves and want to haves. If you want a place exclusive to you, you can count the old mill out. In October 2010, there were 5 weddings scheduled for our day in sept 2011...which was considered low. By the day of our wedding there were 13 weddings throughout the day, but I guess the more the merrier. I did bump into I think three other brides but that didn't stop me from thinking that I was having the best wedding ever.

Although there are menus packaged for you, you can customize everything to your liking. Taking out a soup, adding a salad, even changing your potatoes. My catering executive Rita, was absolutely amazing. So professional and got every detail down to a tea. When we went for our food tasting and told jerker that we thought the wrong dessert was given to us, she arranged for a separate dessert tasting, where we got to try our requested dessert... Thank goodness because that is the one we went with. There was a night off wine tasting where you could try different offerings and upgrade if you wished. We did end up changing our red wine at a small cost, but so worth it. Our beer was all upgraded and they only charge you on the bottles that get opened, not what you anticipate people Will drink. In the end we got a mini refund because we guesstimated more than what was consumed.

We had our wedding in Room Brule C. It is one of 3 ballrooms, each with a capacity of 180, or you can open the partition if you have more people. We had 110, which met the minimum requirement ofe 100. The serving staff was so courteous, they would bring our the cooked food in platters so that the food was moist and stayed hot. When i left my seat, someone would come by with a heat cover and they always made sure I was taken care of. The captain who over saw the whole night of events made sure that our night went off without a hitch. All requests were accommodated, no questions asked.

I had some much fun throughout the night that I was so sad when the lights turned out.... I could've have on dancing for hours. We opted to stay in one of their suites at a 50% discount, which still went at $250  a night, but the room was beautiful. You walk into a little hallway that leads to a living room with a fireplace and a bay window that overlooks the terrace to the restaurant. The bedroom had a huge bed and a lovely gift basket. The washroom had a large turbo jet tub and two sinks. Wish we could've stayed for an extra night .

The old mill isn't for everyone but the coincidental thing is that my husband's  parents got married here 30 years ago too. I think it is classy and sophisticated and other people may prefer chic and modern. If you don't have your wedding here, I hope you have the opportunity to even have a meal here...it is quite lovely.

I could not have asked for anything else on my wedding day."}
{"text":"Been there for Easter Brunch. Nice place, felled welcomed at first. Waiting 15 min for a coffee and way longer for somebody to take bar drink order (yes they are different servers with access to the bar). With a price of 49.50 per person and no different than any other Sunday - shame on you. Service was on the bad side. They were two elderly gentlemen's try to service 6 tables. Of course will be hard to handle, but they even did not try. And when figure out that they can not make it, there was not even an excuse. Food was ok, but nothing special for the price, easter or Sunday."}
{"text":"The Old Mill is a Christmas Day tradition in my family. However, I don't know if it will continue. This year was a bit disappointing. Seemingly as busy as every year, the staff seem less attentive and don't offer service as much as the used to. The quality and variety of food appears to have gone down; I miss the lobster. The salad dressing was also a lot thinner than normal and really soaked my plate. Santa also didn't spend time coming around to tables. He may have stopped at one or two but that was it."}
{"text":"Came here for afternoon tea with my parents over the August long weekend. We reserved for 3pm, came a little early and so were told to wait while they were setting the tables in the Tea Room. There was not a great selection of teas on their menu but the quality was good. The food portions per person were smaller than the usual places we frequent for afternoon tea. Taste-wise, I think it is a hit and miss. Some say it is delicious while I personally think it is average. From what I understand, there is also a vegetarian and gluten-free option for their afternoon tea. They are currently celebrating their centennial anniversary so everyone gets to take home a small box of their centennial tea. 

If anyone is arriving by car and needs to park in their paid parking lot, beware. There is a huge hole at the entrance that was covered with water when I was there a few days ago. I wasn't aware that underneath the water the hole was so big that it managed to flatten my tire. Didn't realize until I came out from my afternoon tea and was forced to call CAA. Apparently, CAA said I wasn't the first one to flatten my tire. He had been called twice in two days at the same location. If anyone responsible for that parking lot is reading this, they should fix that hole quickly."}
{"text":"Have you ever witnessed how Pop Tarts are made? There's a video on YouTube called, \"How it's Made - Toaster Pastries / Pop Tarts.\" It's a really fun video. In this analogy, my wife and I are the pop tarts and Old Mill Toronto (OMT) is the conveyor belt machine doohickey.

You're on a wedding conveyor belt machine doohickey. This wedding conveyor belt machine doohickey churns out couples at a rapid pace. I think I saw five other couples whose receptions were happening at the same time as ours. And they kept coming (or going) throughout the day. There were newlyweds and wedding photographers practically tripping over each other. Also seen: bridal parties eyeing other bridal parties while making faces that said, \"OMG can you believe they wore that?\" So entertaining.

Honestly, the experience felt very impersonal. Not to suggest that the OMT staff weren't great. They did their duties quite well, and then some. It just felt like we were... pop tarts. There were moments where I felt annoyed that OMT wasn't willing to budge on aspects of our reception. But now I realize why they didn't budge. Because they didn't need us. We needed (wanted) them. There are hundreds of couples waiting in the wings to take your spot if you decide to opt out, and OMT knows it. 

The food was great. Everyone I asked (after) really enjoyed the food. I also really enjoyed the food. The appetizers were probably my favorite, but all of the courses (including the dessert) were well made, beautifully presented and tasted quite delicious. Or this is true for what little I was able to eat. No one tells you that you don't get to enjoy the food on your wedding day. I would have liked to know that. What kind of terrible world do we live in where you can't even enjoy food on your wedding day? 

The service was kind of hit-or-miss according to the guests. They were apparently training some new staff members during our reception, which led to some delays in the food being served to some of our guests. I was a little disappointed to hear about that. But the OMT staff also assisted in mitigating a disaster with our wedding cake, so kudos on that front.

The grounds are beautiful. The hotel is beautiful. The restaurant they have is pretty good. We've had the food there, and it's kind of pricey (by my standards at least, maybe Torontonians think it's normal) but not exorbitantly so. I don't think the quality of the food (at least this is true for what we had) justified the prices though.

The only other issue we had was due to mis-communication or confusion... or something. We were supposed to get a room the night of the wedding, but we found out a week before the wedding that all of the rooms were booked for that night. So we had to spend our honeymoon night elsewhere, but OMT put us up the following night in a Deluxe King Suite so mostly fine I suppose.

That Deluxe King Suite though... Fan-freakin'-legen-wait for it-dary-tastic. For one night, I felt like money. Not any of that \"self-made millionaire\" nonsense. I felt like old money. I felt like a trust fund baby who has never had to work for anything in his life. I felt like... Chuck Bass. It was glorious. So glorious. I'm crying a little thinking about that room right now.

Edit: So when we were considering Old Mill (and other venues) for our wedding reception, one of the things they told us (in an attempt to sweeten the deal I'm sure) was that we would get a free night's stay on our first anniversary. When we tried to take them up on the offer, they conveniently had no idea what we were talking about. And it wasn't in the contract, since we were told to take them at their word on it. And looking through the other reviews, it looks like they've pulled this nonsense with at least one other person. That's kinda d*ckish, you know?"}
{"text":"\"Sunday Brunch here is almost like a tradition. It's like a quick getaway\"

Sunday Brunch tended to be a tradition in my family, though we tended to do it at other buffets, and living in the suburbs that typically was a Chinese buffet. Well having family who lives near the Old Mill, we thought we'd try it.

It's a nice selection in a really beautiful part of the city. The problem is finding parking which always tends to fill up, but once you do, it's a nice setting to sit down and feel like you're dining in a place with a lot of history.

You can take a tour later and see there are constantly weddings and celebrations going on. There's an on-site chapel as well as several rooms, and activity areas to enjoy. You'll really like the walk in door and out. Fun place to go and it's a nice place for all ages and definitely screams \"Sunday Brunch\""}
{"text":"While I wandered through the beautiful hotel lobby and grounds a bit, this review is for the brunch buffet on Victoria Day.

While looking for a place for brunch with out of town guests, we decided this was worth a try. With one nearly impossible-to-please person in the group, the Old Mill proved to be a brilliant decision.

For about 25$ per person (tax, tip and all), we ate very well. Have I had a better meal? Yes, but I paid much more for it. (For $20 I could have had an eggs Benny and small salad at any one of dozens of similar brunch spots in the city. Here I had a feast.)

Here I particularly enjoyed the salmon in white-wine sauce, green salad with fruit and feta, seafood salad, roast beef, and fresh fruit. The desserts were good, if a little less exciting than the salads and mains.

The buffet features different salads, fruits, meats, breads, and desserts. There is a nice variety of seafood, red meat, and no meat options here. Everyone in my party got to eat what they wanted and loved it.

Service here was excellent. My server was especially friendly (and I wish I could remember her name because she was brilliant) and was very efficient despite having several tables.

The setting is lovely, service delightful, and buffet a true value. If you want to do something a bit apart from the normal brunch routine, this is a great option."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday for Winterlicious. I booked a reservation a week in advance. I drive 1 hour to get there and pay to park. I see Winterlicious signage posted in the restaurant. I proceed to sit down with my family only to find out there is no Winterlicious on Sunday. Wtf? No mention on the website at all.  Contrary to what the waitresses claimed I never received any call to let me know. We ask if there is A La Carte and there isn't either... Wtf? The earlier waitress asks if we'd like to eat the $40 buffet without mentioning that price. Who in their mind would pay $40 pp for a shitty buffet when you can go to Four Seasons for $28 pp during Winterlicious. We left immediately. This is very dishonest. Do no go to Old Mill. I will never ever return."}
{"text":"So here's the thing. We've been coming here over the holidays for awhile. You have to have reservations and each one is for a maximum 2 hour seating. The only thing that used to creep me out a bit about this place is how super white it was. I was happy to see that's no longer the case anymore! The Christmas dinner we book for is a buffet and the place is huge, so you might want to keep that in mind when filling your plate (food that's overhanging the edge may end up on the floor/some other persons lap). There's quite a bit to choose from. Basically there's a cold table (w cold mussels, salads, peel your own shrimp etc.), there's a fondue fountain with fruit and cake skewers you can dip in it, as well some warm foods, and two sides (of the same warm foods) around the middle part where they serve prime rib and lamb. I especially liked the beef stew. There are also sausages with peppers, rice with cranberries, a pasta dish, garlic mashed potatoes, soup etc. It's a nice place to go with family, but it's not quiet, if you're looking for bonding time. It's good for all ages. We have a LOT of serious food allergies in the family and everyone managed to find something they could have. My favourite dessert was this amazing, tart, raspberry mousse (unfortunately served in teensy shot glasses, basically a teaspoonful).
Service was great, attentive and friendly without feeling too rushed.
I should add that I have a HUGE penchant for their Centennial Tea. It's their own blend and it's $10 a box (!!) of only 10 bags (advertised at 2 cup, but still), it's $1 a bag (or 50 cents if used twice). I'm a very big tea drinker - generally organic, high quality, loose and sometimes bagged teas, so for me to spend this much on this little says a lot. I wish it was more affordable because I'd buy it more often (than once a year)!"}
{"text":"Was here a few weeks ago for a wedding. Fabulous, beautiful venue. From the Wedding Garden to the Westminster Room...just an all around great looking space.

Staff were fantastic as well, really putting the extra effort in to help the bride and groom. Even the front desk staff when I first arrived as simply a member of the wedding party, not even a hotel guest, were very helpful. 

Got a peek at the honeymoon suite (I think?) as well and it was a gorgeous space with a balcony overlooking the grounds. Got dressed in one of the standard rooms and it was quite nice as well, big bathroom, very comfy couch. 

Free parking for hotel guests but the lot can be a bit tight with the new condo development. Located a 30 second walk from it's namesake TTC station if that's how you get around."}
{"text":"Review for afternoon tea: It's become tradition to visit Old Mill. I've been here with mom and with the SO multiple times, and each time we leave very happy. 

The architecture is gorgeous, an oasis tucked in the west end of the city. You're close to the downtown bustle but also removed. It's an ideal location, right off of Old Mill Station.

Afternoon tea is $26.95 from Monday-Thursday, and only a bit more on weekends. There are 3 finger sandwiches, 2 scones, and a selection of pastries per person, so it's not an overwhelming amount of food.The food is more comforting and less fanciful with raw ingredients or presentation than, say, the Windsor Arms. But it costs almost half the amount and the location is far more leisurely.

I found the waiter/hostess a bit brusque at first during seating, but everything went smoothly afterwards. Tea refills, collecting of foods, etc. all happened unobtrusively. We even got to take home a boxed tea set! (It's complimentary for aft tea).

Only considerations: restaurant is hard to find, their parking lot seems to be free only for hotel guests and not dining ones, and the historical nature of the building gets stuffy. Otherwise, an awesome place to be."}
{"text":"Stayed 1 night for a business mtg while in Toronto.  A very nice hotel in an old mill.  The room was very comfortable with high end linen and toiletries.  My room also had a whirlpool tub which was a nice touch.  I'd compare it to a Intercontinental or Westin as far as price.

Breakfast in the restaurant was good.  Coffee was excellent. 

Staff was friendly and would stay again next time I'm in Toronto on business."}
{"text":"I visited the Old Mill recently for an dinner event. We were seated inside a room just off the main restaurant.

The Old Mill is very visually striking upon arrival, however once you start looking around it's impressiveness begins to dwindle somewhat. It was also incredibly confusing once inside. We had no idea where exactly our group was being seated, and there was nobody around to give us some guidance. Somehow managed to muddle our way through the restaurant to the right place. 

The Room: I am not a huge fan of the \"historical\" look in terms of carpet and wallpaper, so perhaps my opinion of our room is biased, but I felt as though it looked \"old\" (and not in a good way). The carpet looked worn down, as if it could use a replacement, and the walls looked heavy with dust. The table clothes were plain white, but I found a few runs in the fabric. It didn't live up to the historical elegance that the building itself exudes.

The food: I enjoyed the food quite a bit. I had chicken with some potatoes, carrots, zucchini and cauliflower. The chicken was well cooked and seasoned, and the potatoes and carrots were absolutely delicious. We also had a small dessert platter which was quite good.The only downside to the dining experience was having a spider walk across the dinner table. Yuck! But I suppose that's bound to happen in old buildings.

Service: It really depended on the person. Our servers were a bit bossy and always in our faces (urging us to sit down, even though people were just arriving and greeting one another). However, they were also quite attentive in serving us our food, refilling our water, etc. I believe the manager walked around an ensured we were all happy with our food, which was greatly appreciated. 

Overall I'd come back if invited to an event, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to come her of my own accord. The building itself is truly quite beautiful, but I didn't find the inside nearly as impressive as I expected it to be."}
{"text":"I had lunch here about two months ago and ordered their lunch buffet.  I have actually had their lunch buffet a on a few occasions about 10 years ago, and enjoyed the food and service during those time, so I had very high expectations during this visit.  

I must say that I was very disappointed with the lunch buffet this time.  It has been about 10 years since I have last been here, and the quality of the food has certainly declined.  The prime rib was the only item on the buffet which I can say was good, as it was fresh and hand carved, although a bit tough.  The other meat item was the pork which was dry and bland.  However, the most disappointing part of the buffet was the deserts.  From my previous experiences, the dessert was always the best part of the buffet because there was plenty of variety, and all of it was fresh and homemade.  The dessert selection this time was limited to a few options, which were dry and may have been homemade, but tasted store bought.  

The price of the buffet was very high at $29.99 per person, but I would not mind paying that price if their quality and selection was as good as it was before.  I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"The Old Mill is a really beautiful complex so we decided to stay there for my birthday. Overall we enjoyed ourselves thanks to our positive attitude and thanks to cherishing each other's company. But our stay was definitely disappointing because of 2 staff members in particular. One was at the spa - separate business but still included here - where a lady seemed to be bothered by my questions \"if I could get a robe like everyone else for my pedicure and if she would turn on the sauna for me.\" It is a one persons sauna, maybe 2, so they need to turn it on for you. The most unfortunate experience happened after checking out the next day. Unfortunately I forgot my bikini at the spa on Sunday and as it is closed on Monday I asked if there was anyone having access to it since I am not in Toronto very often. While I understand the spa is its own business, the lady who checked us out explained that there was nothing she could do and apologized. Another lady also present though joined the conversation and was absolutely rude and behaved like a petulant child who did not want to be bothered. She compared the spa in their hotel with a convenience store \"when a convenience store is closed you can't go in there either \". Very childish, bad choice of words and certainly not educated well enough to work in such an upscale hotel. I wonder how they hire the people there."}
{"text":"been there three times  with my family for lunch .
i have to say ,its a beautiful place to eat.and also the food is absolutely good . service is awesome.let me try the dinner next time and post more info here"}
{"text":"I was here for a wedding and the building itself along with the surroundings is lovely. 
Parking is in the back which I believe fills up quite quickly - I was WAY in the back and around the corner.

Sadly my girls and I were on a time crunch with 15 min to spare to get to the wedding.  Let's just say we missed the ceremony!! :( This place is a bloody maze and they should really have more signs in regards to where to go for the chapel and the ballrooms.   I had no idea where I was - and by the time we went from the first floor to the second, around the staircase and down a little hallway the signing was already happening :( I was soooo disappointed but I had a peek in to see the chapel and it looked nice.

After that ordeal we went to the ballroom and they set it up so nicely.
I think they did a good job.
I saw a few other rooms that were open to view and some of them were stunning as well. 

Food was okie - really enjoyed the salad selection - I had way too much food on my plate (it was buffet style) and they they just threw everything onto my plate - it was LOADED. 

Dessert was the best part which seems to be everyone's opinion.

I would definetely consider booking this place for an event if needed."}
{"text":"Gord and I spent an afternoon at the Old Mill Inn Spa.  We'd been there in March for Gord's birthday and liked it so he treated me there for my birthday.

Our first service was an hour long couple's massage.  Belinda was my massage therapist and she was awesome!  I'd had her in March too.  She gives a deep massage.

Then we had a pedicure.  Stef gave me a Chocolate Peppermint Paddy Pedicure (Enjoy a peppermint patty while your tired tootsies are exfoliated, hydrated, massaged and polished to a high gloss.).  My feet and legs smelled amazing afterwards!  Jessica gave Gord a Men's Power Wash Pedicure (Enjoy cleansing, filing, buffing and scrubbing. Finish with a mud mask, power-washed off to leave your feet fully restored!).  While we were getting our pedicure, we had a couple glasses of bubbly.  With lots of colours to choose from, I choose \"I'm Not Really a Waitress\".

I felt soooo relaxed and pampered afterwards.  The staff at the Old Mill take such good care of us ... we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Brunch is what I am reviewing, not the hotel.

1) Old people clamoring and elbowing for the lobster table is scary. 

2) The chimney backed up and started spewing smoke. Mothers with babies sat in pearls trying to look unphased as they started asphyxiating. That's the kind of reserved elegance you are supposed to feel in this place. Hogwash. The staff stood around laughing. I ran for the door and had to put a menu wedged in since noone was paying attention.

Otherwise, the brunch was extensive and tasty. Hot buffet of savories, and tables piles with sweets. 

We walked off the calories on the grounds and inside the labyrinthine walls later."}
{"text":"You know I read 1/2 a star review of The Old Mill maybe 30 years ago in the Toronto Star. I was in shock that a major paper would dare write such a damning article on a Toronto institution. I have no idea if they were right back then but the 1/2 star number was definitely true for us today.

Other than a couple of young staff I'm pretty sure I saw no employees smile but I have to add it was so dark where we were seated it was often difficult to tell unless a staff member was standing under their dim \"Tales From The Crypt\" pot lighting.

The Thanksgiving buffet sadly featured nothing but bland or soupy or heat-lamp-crusty efforts.

Our wooden server treated us more like an intruder than a valued guest?

Thank god there was a lone highlight in the Hidden Bench Riesling that was actually very nice.

Just a brutal experience."}
{"text":"Went for a wedding.  Beautiful grounds with unique  backdrops for pictures. 

Hotel rooms are very dated as are the common areas.  It does have character which I understand why it is popular but for the prices of the room you can get a much better room elsewhere.  

Service at the banquet was not the greatest.  They were very busy with a lot of other weddings it seemed.  

This place is a giant maze with poor signage.  Even getting directions there was over 10 steps from hotel front desk to the banquet halls.  

Parking was abundant across the street."}
{"text":"What a great place. Been here for events and weddings (never the spa though) and since the new owners have taken over, you can tell how much it's improved. Glad to see the changes."}
{"text":"Probably the most amazing Sunday Buffet in the city! Only thing that tops it is the mother days Buffett. Everyone must check it out. Price is up there but you will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Dark.   Depressing.   Staff is nowhere to be found.    The architecture is nice but that's it.    Not even a store to buy water or a snack.   Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Out of all of my high tea experiences, this has been one of my least favorite - but I think the ones I'm comparing it to were quite exceptional. The location and design of the old mill is gorgeous. Stone floors and walls, beautiful old architecture - it's definitely a sight to be seen. The dining room, where high tea is done, is nice and spacious, the tables aren't crammed together and they are set up very nicely. Since it is the 100th year of operations, all high tea guests were given a free package of 10 tea bags of their special centennial tea. 
I went with my mom and we were able to specify gluten free for me. The biggest difference was my mom was served scones and I was not. There was no substitution - just no scones. This annoyed me. At least give me some sort of sad attempt at a gfree scone and I'll applaud the effort. So the regular afternoon tea goers get: 3 sandwiches (salmon and cream cheese pinwheel, cucumber and cream cheese, and egg salad on a croissant), 4 scones, jam/butter/marmalade, 1 tuxedo (choc dipped) strawberry, 1 shortbread cookie, 1 lemon meringue tart and 1 slice of a pink and green cake - we never did figure out what it was. You also get never ending pots of loose leaf Tea. The gluten free side: 3 sandwiches (same as above, but all on small circle of gfree bread), 1 bowl of fruit, a piece of flourless cake and a meringue cookie with berries on top + never ending tea. While I applaud the effort to accommodate gfree guests, I think more could be done to make it more equal. Gluten free scones are easy enough to make and if they can do the breads and desserts, they must have a safe food prep area. The tea was delicious and we had a lovely time but this is the first time I've left afternoon tea and still been hungry. Made me a little sad. Not bad value at $24.95 (mon-thurs), and good enough for 4 stars. Honestly, the scone thing made me bitter. If you aren't gfree, you will have an incredible time. If you are - make your own scones and smuggle them in."}
{"text":"Would not recommend unless you have a rich uncle or too much of your own money to spend.. 

Lets start with The Good - staff was great, checkin quick, location is next to the subway and 20 min away from downtown as well as nice park / river within few minutes walk. 

The Bad = problem was with paying double or even triple what you usually pay for 5 star hotel but only getting 3 stars at best.. No value for money thats for sure.. 

The rooms are antique and furniture looks like it came from the 1960s = comes off looking like a cheap motel.. the bed / mattress was horrible = after 3 nights my back was killing me.. 

We went to eat at the restaurant one day.. food was blah but prices once again double or triple what you pay at the Keg for example.. 

.. and to end it all = after spending thousands of dollars on 3 nights.. we had to pay extra for resort fee.. common.. 

Please save your money and stay somewhere else.."}
{"text":"For the price of the food I expected much better!
I ordered the steak which would have been full price at other restaurants, only to be told that each individual side is $9.00. 
The taste was average.
I do love the look of this old establishment but get better quality food at lower prices elsewhere."}
{"text":"Gorgeous building & location. Friendly staff. THE FOOD at the restaurant was extremely disappointing. Very poor dull menu & poor quality food. Once the chef revamps things, we will return."}
{"text":"Attention recently engaged couples, this is a review of Old Mill Toronto as a wedding venue.

Pros:
-They are open for consultation on weekends, even on a Sunday. 
-Having done thousands (if not tens of thousands) of couples' weddings to date, they are relatively organized and they offer a standard service. During the consultation, we were given a nice folder with checklists. We were also given a tour of the chapel as well as a number of rooms that would fit our expected number of guests.
-Great location if your guests are mostly coming from the GTA; the Old Mill is also accessible by public transportation with a TTC stop, Old Mill station. 
-Beautiful and cozy atmosphere
-Easy to arrange for other services, in particular, the organist was awesome! He arranged for other musicians to join him and play for our ceremony. 
-Complimentary room was provided so we could do a Chinese tea ceremony before the reception.
-They assign you a Captain on your wedding day. You won't find out who that will be until the morning of your wedding, but it's super helpful to have this \"wedding coordinator\" from the Old Mill even if you have your own. 

Cons:
-Somewhat disorganized and not detail-oriented catering manager: she made a lot of mistakes in the documents including estimates. We understand that things are not going to be perfect, but we would expect that they would not make silly mistakes such as referring to my fiancé as a Ms. so-and-so. This mistake appeared again despite telling her the first time to correct it. She provided estimates with an incorrect number of guests, incorrect pricing (we had to point out that the beef option was actually more costly than the chicken option). She also forgot to tell us about other random fees such as chair cover fee and coat check fee. We found out about them just before payments were due. In another instance, she gave me a wrong phone number to one of the Ministers who provides his service in association with the Old Mill. I called the number and the person on the other line is like what? I'm not a Minister, lol.  
-\"I don't care\" approach from the Minister, arranged via the Old Mill: after finally getting the right phone number to one of the Ministers, I called him. He told me it's another one that will be doing weddings for the month our wedding was in. I called this other one, and he sounded like a nice person to preside over our ceremony. I was really looking forward to it; then, this other Minister called me back and said it's actually yet another Minister that would be helping us for our ceremony. After being transferred from one Minister to another, I felt like we weren't being cared for at all. The Minister responsible for us eventually called me and said he was on vacation and that he could not book our rehearsal, so we waited and waited until he would contact us again. After more than a month had passed, he still did not reply to our email or gave us a call. He showed basically no interest at all in learning about us or guiding us with this marriage process. We really wanted some guidance because we wanted to be prepared for the ceremony. He only provided us with this email containing reading materials to review by ourselves. I was pretty disappointed with this level of indifference shown by the Minister, and we considered finding another Minister, but eventually, he did arrange the rehearsal and we were hopeful that in-person interaction might turn out to be better. For the actual ceremony, the Minister did do an amazing job with his deep, penetrating voice. He was flexible and allowed us to do the ceremony the way we wanted to. I'm glad that it turned out to be a happy ending after all.  
-Need to pay the full balance almost three weeks before the ceremony: we were asked to pay the balance in full almost three weeks before our ceremony. This may be a standard practice with wedding venues, but I wish they were more flexible and asked for the final guest numbers and payment closer to our wedding day, since it's not like they would be preparing the food weeks before our ceremony, anyway. They should also know that some guests may back out last minute.
-Other: we weren't told in advance that having the maximum number of people for a room meant we could not fit in a Photo Booth or a photo slideshow projector. During the reception, we decided to go with Old Mill's music in the room, and they forgot to turn it on, so we had to remind the Captain. In addition, watch out for silly little fees such as beef up-charge, caking cutting, coat check, parking pass, chair cover fees and so on."}
{"text":"Went there for a wedding and reception and was very impressed as to how organized they were about it. Everyone there was very friendly and helpful and seemed to be used to people asking them dumb questions like the ones I did. 

The wedding was a success and the location was great."}
{"text":"I came here for Afternoon Tea on a crisp, windy Autumn day. The menu is left on the table for you to decide, whether you want the regular tea service or want to enhance it with sparkling wine. They have a decent selection of teas, but nothing fancy where you have to flip page after page of tea selection.

Each tea serving comes with a finger-sized quiche, salmon & cucumber sandwich, 2 scones with jam and clotted cream, a finger-sized lemon tart and finger-sized carrot cake. It's quite yummy.

The seating is from 2pm till 4pm. Fortunately, my party arrived early and we spent the full 2 hours and a half chit chatting away!  The servers don't bother you so if you want more water for your tea, you need to flag them.

On the day I went, they served Afternoon Tea in the covered patio of the dinning room.

One more thing, this place is a labyrinth and from the main entrance, I took the stairs 2 levels below and followed the snarling aisle to the dining room, but not before getting lost and wandering through many aisles.  It would really benefit if they have a hostess located in the main entrance. It would not hurt!"}
{"text":"Went here for sunday lunch buffet today. Food was good but small amount of selection - not sure if it is worth $35 pp. for that pricing level, perhaps the coffee and tea should be served in nicer China. The inside dining room is nice but our table was rocking and it is right in space. The service was nice and courteous. The grounds are nice but it could be bigger. From some views it was nice but there is a large condo building right next door which ruins the skyline. Will visit again but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I came here today for Sunday brunch with my family.  This is my third time coming to The Old Mill, and first time reviewing.  The atmosphere is gorgeous and the service was fast and friendly.  The buffet had a lot of options and the quality was good - a lot of times at buffets the food sits out for too long and it dries up or changes to an undesirable temperature, but not here.   

The price is a bit expensive - $35 per person + drinks, but for a special occasion this is an ideal spot.  I would definitely recommend coming here at least once."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place 1 star is because I can't give no star. The service is absolutely appalling and the lady who was hosting at the front had the worst attitude I've ever seen in the history of the service industry. She attacked my party for walking past the line not knowing that we had already got our table and when she realized that she had no business stopping us she gave us a nasty eye roll and let us through unwillingly. Her tone was awful and i wish I got her name to put in this review cause she should be ashamed of bringing that attitude representing a supposed historical establishment of Toronto. I don't even care if their food is magical I would never come again to be treated like that. Then we got attacked by a second staff, a man who looked like some supervisor running around like a headless chicken. Attacked us because we looked lost, well of course we look lost we were never greeted or acknowledge and just had to hunt for our table in the maze they call their dining area. We practically had to sneak in to avoid a second attack from the same lady at the front so yes we did not look like we knew exactly where the table is. Honestly the staff had no idea what reservations they had all day and even telling them the name and number of our party they were all CLUELESS. What is their purpose if they can't take me to my table? 

And their food wasn't even that great it was average. I will give it to them that their hot food was hot enough. But I would NEVER come again. THE ONLY thing that salvaged the lunch (if you can even call it being salvaged) was that we got a decent waitress who was some-what nice and professional, not the best but she seemed amazing after coming face to face with the awful hostess and man. If you don't look like a 70 year old white English lady or are just not white they will make you feel like you do not belong and make sure you feel like you don't belong. Honestly this place is racist, I would not recommend anyone of colour coming here."}
{"text":"I am reviewing only the Sunday brunch.

First and foremost, this place is absolutely gorgeous, and very old school.  The Old Mill has a rich history and was designated a heritage site in 1983.  As of 2001, they added a hotel and spa.  The complex is built in the style of Tudor Revival Architecture and is also a venue for weddings.  The restaurant is located in a very attractive hall within the complex.  

The buffet is plentiful.  There is a table for salads, a table for cold seafood (such as 'peel and eat shrimp', smoked mackerel, cold muscles, etc.), a table for cold cuts, a table for cheese and breads, a buffet of offerings and a desert table.  
All of the food is quite tasty and is replenished often.

In addition, there's a chocolate fountain!  They say that \"feedback is the breakfast of champions\", so how about a chocolate feedback to start off your day?

An added bonus is that the Old Mill is nestled right next to the beautiful and lush Humber River.  After your brunch, you can take a stroll along the beautiful Discovery Trail and try to burn off some of those calories :-)"}
{"text":"I went to the Old Mill Inn and Spa this morning with a friend for breakfast. Not being from Toronto, I wasn't aware or familiar with The Old Mill historically, nor the luxury and prestige it connotes. 

From a \"travel\" perspective, I have to say, driving to this establishment from where I live was lovely. The route we took through that part of Toronto was really beautiful, and so unlike most of the city. (I mean in the woodsy, detached homes, and tiny winding roads kinda way)

Regardless, we arrived at The Old Mill (which was really a beautiful place to eat breakfast) and I ordered the \"Twisted Pancakes\" -- three very nicely made pancakes topped with creme fraiche, carmelized apples and served with DELICIOUS home fries (roasted potatoes perfectly seasoned with fleur de sel and rosemary). My friend had the omelette with sausage, roma tomato, and goat cheese (also with homefries). We both enjoyed our meals (a lot) and while I wouldn't come back here regularly both because of the inconvenience (its' not close) and the price (12 for my pancakes, 15 for his omelette, a few bucks for tea and coffee and breakfast was almost 40 with a tip). This isn't a crazy expensive meal, but it's more for breakfast than I usually pay, and doesn't have the \"walkability\" or neighbourhood factor for an after-breakfast stroll I usually like. 

I will DEFINITELY go back, but most likely for birthdays or special occasions."}
{"text":". We had high expectations for the father's day brunch today, and it was mediocre at best. The food we just okay, and there wasn't a large selection of it. Basic- just eggs, bacon and sausage (nothing made to order, no pancakes, waffles or french toast) with one pasta, mashed potatoes, veg and a few dif. meats. The lobsters were a good addition.. but not of the highest quality. The rest of the seafood was just ok, fishy tasting and over salted. The fruit was just one tray and a basic selection that was under ripe, the baked goods meh. Everything was meh.

And the crowds were ridiculous- people bumping into each other left and right, the big sellers were gone as soon as there were put down, and the line to get through the hot stuff was about 20 minutes.. for 8 options. 

Not what I would call a $50 buffet AT ALL."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday night to celebrate a family birthday.    The staff were very attentive and courteous through our entire visit.   The Sunday Buffet spread was terrific with many many choices, we almost tried them all and will have to come back again for sure.    Compared to the average buffet this one has superb food quality and well worth the price."}
{"text":"We came here for the Thanksgiving Buffet ($44.95 per person + tax + tip) last year, as our respective families don't really celebrate Thanksgiving. My fiance and I arrived promptly for our 8 pm reservation, but didn't get seated until half an hour later. People tend to take their sweet time at buffets. The restaurant was packed with hungry diners, and all servers were pretty much running around everywhere. The food stations were centrally located in the middle of the room, which was nice. Of course, it's much cheaper to cook a full meal at home, but we're essentially paying for the convenience of not needing to cook or clean, so I was content with that. Overall, I was happy with the food selection, including the variety of desserts available. The one thing that I didn't really like was that the roast beef was too chewy, but other than that, it wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Been here for: 
- Afternoon tea
- Wedding reception

Pros
- quaint and old-style Victorian (sorry if my architecture references are wrong!) establishment; it's got a really nice, British vibe to everything (the decor, the way the place is set up etc.), and so it matches really well with what you're going to The Old Mill for.
- the outside gardens are nice for strolling around in; the restaurants and dining areas itself are secluded from each other and allows for privacy
- food is better than average, but not mind-blowing (\"OMG I MUST COME BACK AGAIN!\"
- out of all the nicer end afternoon tea locations in Toronto, the Old Mill is one of the cheaper ones (~$20/person M-F)

Cons
- quite pricey for wedding reception meal
- a bit of a confusing labyrinth of hallways; the Old Mill was previously a mansion-style home, and so the restaurants, dining areas, rooms and spas are located all over, and you need to pay attention to the signs in order to get to where you're going! Easy to get lost!
- CONFUSION: it really is easy to get confused and disoriented at The Old Mill - you're not 100% sure where to park, where to walk into the building, where your restaurant is, where this is and where that is. Make sure you KNOW which dining room you want to get to, and once you park, find the closest staff member to direct you there!
- must make reservations; difficult to dine here w/o them.

Overall: 
The food is a bit pricey, but the environment more than makes up for it. It's a nice place to go if you're looking to drop some cash for a nice date or if you're a female and looking to spend some bonding time w/ other girls for an afternoon tea date."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch ever tried. Infinite options of everything, from breads to seafood. Go hungry! Sophisticated and cozy place at the same time. Perfect for a celebration of something special!"}
{"text":"Anachronism! Travel back in time to overdone meat, food swimming in sauces and yes, deep-fried calamari as an appetizer. We asked for gluten-free choices (celiac disease, not a fad) and have no confidence that was respected because next came a platter of crusty bread plus when they brought the battered calamari for our companion they brought plates for sharing (no batter, no wheat, no gluten!!!). Beef was overdone, fish was in a cheap Chinese restaurant red sweet sauce, lamb was \"not worth $54\". Service was there but ... I hope the nightly trip back the the sixties in the resident time machine doesn't harm them."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch buffet for my mother's burthday.  It's a little pricey but there is a huge selection.  It's one of those places you just go once to experience.  

Might need reservations. 

it's also a great place to take photos for the family on a nice sunny day."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. Great hotel off Bloor. Convenient in that it's close to a subway station and some trails at kings park. Really not close to much else though ( walking distance wise). Service is great. Stay comes with breakfast. It's chocked full of weddings on the weekends tho."}
{"text":"First of all, my family had reservations for my grandparents 60th anniversary, but we got called the day before saying they have changed our reservation time AND changed where we were seated. After a bit of talking to them they finally decided they could 'fit us in' for the original time but at a totally different table. When we arrived we were NOT greeted and they didn't seat us. The lady at the front POINTED to our table and told is that's where we are seated. I was shocked; started off the evening with a bad impression. (Not to mention to apologies on the phone about the reservation mess up.) 

The food was average. Nowhere near the quality that you should receive for the amount of money your spending. No one at my table of 8 enjoyed any of the meats. My family loves desserts and we didn't even go up for a second helping, I have had better desserts at Mandarin (not to mention Mandarins amazing customer service). For being a buffet, there are definitely not enough options. 

The venue is very nice but not enough lighting. They have a wedding garden which WOULD be adorably perfect for a small wedding or even family photos if you are there for a special occasion but there were no plants.. No garden; and that was in the summer season!

Venue: 4 out of 5 (add an actual garden)
Food: 2 out of 5
Staff: 2 out of 5
Not impressed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Like another recent poster, we too have made the Old Mill Toronto a Christmas tradition, and it has come after the Royal York discontinued its shopper's brunch traditional buffet.  Needless to say, we've had more than a half century of attending the Christmas buffets at historic Toronto locations.  The Old Mill Christmas brunch tradition is a new location for us, only having attended the past several years, and given our experience this year, may be our last.  Firstly, our December 23rd reservation for the brunch made months in advance comes with a warning that cancellations are charged, so be warned.  We didn't cancel, but did find that despite the reservationist's advisement of the menu and charges, the brunch wasn't offered on the day we attended.  We had to order from the lunch menu: burgers, sandwiches, and fish and chips, etc, were our choices.  The manager later advised that the new staff didn't provide the correct information, and we did get a 'sorry'.  The food was good for a (pardon the pun) run of the Mill pub restaurant menu.  The chicken wings were decent as an appetizer too.  Let's be honest here, the location is spectacular to dine in, and offers great historic charm in any season.  It's nothing new to us, and we're thankful to be there.  My mother even had her wedding party here in the 60s, so it is a place with a lot of family history too!  The service was absolutely deplorable though, and that is where the main problems are with this review, and I hate to give bad reviews, but this service level deserves it, really.  As a previous poster advised, service was poor, and slow.  We had to retrieve our waiter on a few occasions, physically having to get up and go and get him while he was socializing with other waiters.  This was no young inexperienced looking wait staff member either.  There was truly a sense of not caring.  This reached a ridiculous level, and the last straw was the curt rapport we had when questioning our billing:  having separately billed 2 pounds of our appetizer chicken wings (yeah, I know), into two single orders, resulting in an additional $6-$8 on our bill.  He even hung around when we talked to the manager at the end about not being advised about the Christmas brunch offering at the time of reserving.  We weren't treated like any patrons should, let alone ones who had been attending the restaurant in one way or another for the last nearly 60 years.  We aren't planning on returning, sadly."}
{"text":"Pretty setting is the best thing I can say about this inn. Far removed from downtown, but Parking IS included & subway is nearby. Buffet breakfast was disappointing: sparse, without juice, pastries, or options. If you don't eat runny scrambled eggs or packaged yogurt with fruit, you may have some underdone sausage or bacon. Upon check-in, we were left to struggle the luggage cart up a steep incline, with no bell person about and no offer of assistance from the reception desk. The room and bath were spacious, and housekeeping was efficient, including turn-down service. If in the area, I would explore other hotel options."}
{"text":"For me, this place had its pros and cons.

I've been here at least twice now, once for a business conference, and more recently for an overnight stay.

The buffet food for the conference - for both breakfast and for lunch, were great.  Lots of choices, good tasting, and there was easily enough for all. 

Nice setting, easy to get to by local transit (get off at Old Mill station, and then walk brief minutes to the Inn).  There's free parking for those who drive.

More recently, I was there for an overnight stay - thanks to a romantic package deal offered by Jaunt.ca.  T'was the season to splurge, and I had impressions of how awesome this offer would be.  I expected the deal to be worth at least the value it boasted.

* room and setting:
In some ways it was its cha-ching.  The room itself was spacious.  The setting came with charm.  It was very comfortable being in the space, and we were transported from our everyday Toronto grind - which forms part of the Old Mill's success.

It's an inn that aims to \"Wow\" their guests, or so the letter from the Manager claims (found at the front of the Information binder).  Human resources will need to hone in on hiring exclusively Service-oriented employees, to get that Wow reputation.

Service from Front-desk reception, namely Shawn, has been consistently excellent.  He listened sincerely to what I said or requested, so there were never any moments of confusion to be had.  Even his phone manners have been steadily useful and efficient.

* amenities:
were okay.  They replaced the inclusion of shower gel for this hand and body foam soap.  As an occasional spa-goer, I personally opted to forgo washing anything but my fingertips with this ultra-foamy soap.  I can't imagine putting something so chemical onto my face or other delicate areas.

* Romantic details, and Package:
Loved walking in to a room that was just set up, comfortably warm in temperature, with soft FM jazz music, dimly-lit candles.  A bottle of 2010 \"Reserve du Vieux Moulin\" white Chardonnay wine, chocolate \"pearls\", and a small bottle of bubble bath was included.


\"Valid for a Luxury King Room with Fireplace and 
  Jacuzzi tub for two, Romantic Package including 
  candles, bubble bath, wine and chocolates upon 
  arrival, 50% discount voucher for Toronto Adventures 
  valid for snow shoeing or cross country skiing at 
  Humber Trail, late checkout at 2pm (based on 
  availability), complimentary premium breakfast for 
  two, complimentary parking.\"

The fireplace was electric.  Hit a light panel... and it switched off.  Still, nice to have in the room.  The tub was fun, but when I read Romantic Package, and worse - when I went to their website to click on some products in their Store, I associated the two and assumed that we'd get something more substantial than a small bottle of bubble bath.  As for the chocolates, being a chocoholic, my mouth mentally watered at something that our teeth could SINK into.  I was disappointed that the chocolates turned out to be... small tiny chocolate \"pearls\".  If anything, these tiny pearls stuck or sunk into the crevices of our teeth.  There was nothing, imo, sexy or sensual, or even romantic about these tiny chocolates.  I would suggest even 3 truffles instead of these pearls.  Something worth sinking our teeth and appetites into.

* Entrance:
We arrived past 5 pm, which limited our visibility into the building.  We parked in the lot, and then meandered in the dark to the nearest entrance - which ended up belonging to the Restaurant's.  This lead to a long and twisty path to finally reach the Front Desk.  Manager: More signage, please!  (see also Heather B's version - from Nov. 15/11, where she also comments on this place being like a \"bloody maze\").  The exit, in daylight, was 100% more straightforward.

* Showerhead:
Lovely showerhead.  Good pressure.  I always notice good water pressure, and expect it at reputable inns/hotels.

*Breakfast:
See above description of the Package details.  \"Premium\" breakfast was disappointing - we were expecting something more elaborate with warm eggs/open coffee/bacon/sausages.  Basically, what we've become used to after frequenting upscale downtown hotels.  Instead, we ate in the Terrace, and had a \"modest\" selection of small bowls to pour cereal into, small cups to pour juice into, an assortment of soft-crusted breads or croissants.

*Sleep Quality:
Their King sized \"King Coil\" mattress was definitely comfortable.  Rough quote was for a reasonable $1000/King-sized mattress.  
Their curtains also effectively blocked out any morning daylight.
(side note to fellow occasional insomniacs: some rooms come with lamps only beside our beds.  I woke up around 5 or 5:30 am.  Couldn't sleep, but didn't want to disturb anyone, or hang out in the bathroom).

I'd go again someday, for a different package, though.  Maybe this one:
