{"text":"Sid's Deli's corned beef sandwich is the real deal.  Sid's sandwich hits the nail on the head.  Beautiful corned beef (moist, not too salty) and good pricing for the size.  Tastes like deli in New York and I mean that in the best possible way.

I had given up trying to find a decent corned beef sandwich in Toronto. So many \"delis\" in Toronto aren't even that, and their meat taste nothing like authentic deli should.  They also overcharge.  

Very glad Sid's is here."}
{"text":"Came here after an awful experience at Bread and Bowl down the street. I live just around the corner but had never gone in and I was defeated from my earlier experience, so I decided to give it a shot. 

Daaaamn they make a good Ruben!!! It was literally 6 inches high and tastes like hot sandwich magic. My friend got the pastrami, same deal. Just watching the owners in the kitchen, it was obvious that they love what they do and take pride in their food. Will definitely be going back. Often."}
{"text":"Tried the corned beef and the pastrami. Both were very good. Would definitely return when in the area. Would consider for a catered event too."}
{"text":"We went for lunch. The lean hand cut \"special\" finally arrived without any pickle and it was fatty not lean. The spice was on top of the meat, not properly soaked into the meat. The owner was flippant and insulting to his customers. At 11:55 am there was no kishka or Matzoh ball soup available. And, how can you serve Kishka and charge 75Â¢ extra for gravy. Kishka always comes with gravy and a large side of rye bread in any decent deli."}
{"text":"Wonderful pastrami !!! Nice staff and service. Must goto place."}
{"text":"Had late lunch here; super friendly staff greeted us. Simple old style diner decor. Ordered deli sandwich combos: I had smoked turkey with onion rings, my companion corned beef and fries. Each came with coleslaw cup and generous crispy pickles.  Quality and quantity  great; traditional deli style and good portions. (l doggy-bagged half my sandwich.) Look forward to the next visit, maybe try the delicious looking Latkas."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for several times. Their corn beef and pastrami are just awesome. It's great to have this deli in the neighbourhood. The owners are cute fun guys to talk to, I found them very kind to the customers. I'll definitely go back many times in the future"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this out for a while now and a recent Buytopia deal was just the push I needed to finally get in the door.

We arrived at around noon on a Saturday and the place was empty. I knew going in that I wanted the Reuben - it's one of my absolute favourite sandwiches, when done right - so obviously that's exactly what I ordered.

My dining companion and I took a seat in the back and waited for our food. About ten minutes later, my friend's food arrived and my food arrived five minutes after that. (Kind of annoying, but I'd rather have hot food than eat simultaneously with someone else.)

The sandwich arrived hot and fresh and I eagerly took a bite. I immediately noticed a lack of Russian dressing but I figured it was missing from the edge of the sandwich. No biggie, I'll take another bite, I thought to myself. Still no dressing. What's going on here, I mumbled as I opened the sandwich. Zero dressing anywhere. I'm not sure if this was an intentional omission but the sandwich suffered for it. I was forced to eat the Reuben with mustard, which is somewhat ridiculous.

Anyway, aside from that, it was a decent spin on the Reuben. It's distinctly lack in abundant helpings of both cheese and sauerkraut, but perhaps this was done to emphasize the meat, which is admittedly quite tasty.

So I'm conflicted. It was a decent sandwich, yes, but was it a Reuben in the traditional sense? It most definitely was not."}
{"text":"Every so often I return to the 'bookmarks' section of my Yelp profile in an effort to reduce clutter and find inspiration for my next review. 

I've noticed a correlation between the number of stars and the length of time it takes me to finish and post something. Maybe it's plain old procrastination. Maybe I don't like bearing bad news. Often (as in this case), it's because I feel the need to write something about an experience with a business, but can't provide the usual straightforward review. 

It's an odd thing when one can have such an off-putting experience with a restaurant but not actually eat anything. It happens occasionally with delivery joints, when food just doesn't show-but I went to Sid's with the intention of enjoying lunch. I left because something about the place just gave me pause. 

I was excited when I saw an honest-to-goodness deli had opened near hospital row. Pastrami (and resultant cholesterol) run in my blood, and the usual suspects (Caplansky's former location on College Street, Croned Beef House, the late Mutual Street Deli) are inaccessible unless I want take out to scarf down at my desk. Since I'm a civilized human, I never want take out. There's a Druxy's in my office building, but if you suggest that counts as deli, I will punch you in the eye. 

A cursory glance at Sid's website bode well; sandwiches and platters were on the pricey side (I don't care that it comes from the same animal-brisket, which requires incredible violence to become tender, is not seak and should not be priced accordingly), but seemed reasonable. They made a big deal about the variety of latke flavours, which would leave me 'meh' unless Hanukkah's around the corner, but in this day and age you've gotta have a gimmick. 

So I rolled up for lunch one day...the place was empty, but I get that deli can be 'niche', and it was new. Of greater concern was the fact that the floor was completely buckled under me; like it had been installed incorrectly or there was extensive water damage. 

A glass display case with cash register and a few lonely containers of cole slaw sat unattended, so I called out.

In hindsight, I kind of wish I hadn't. 

One of the owners came to greet me. He seemed eager to talk about his new business, his big plans, his deli street cred (he had put in time at a number of delis around the city), his inside knowledge (he was the son-in-law of the owner of a wholesale corned beef and hot dog supplier), and to bury the competition. He talked about everything but the food-and the menu he showed me revealed pricing and options that were entirely consistent (read: upcharged) compared to the website. 

I can appreciate his enthusiasm, but for two points: 1) I don't think it's ever cool to trash your competitors. It puts me right off and suggests a lack of confidence in one's own product. Especially since-full disclosure-I'm acquaintances with a deli owner or two, and 2) while he was talking, he scratched himself an awful lot...especially what looked like an open sore or burn on his arm. Dude needed medical attention, or at least a long sleeved shirt before he worked the customer service angle. 

So we chatted. And I got turned off. And left. I hope Sid's Deli does well. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"great place.  friendly owner, loved the pastrami.  vernor's ginger ale in fridge too to get that authentic deli experience"}
