{"text":"I've periodically came to this bakery since I was a kid since the late 90's while living in the neighbourhood. The Deli meats, cheese slices, baked bread, snacks and pastries have always been great when I've gotten them from this location."}
{"text":"Great food.

However, as a portuguese bakery, I think they should have labels for their pastries and food products. instead of knowing the  name of the product of what I want, I can only describe to them what it looks like. It has caused some confusion and I didn't always get what I asked for. 

Also, if you want a grilled cheese and ham sandwitch, it would take about 10 mins to prepare and grill it, so not a quick grab and go type of food. But the food is awesome and their prices are not bad."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this place is awesome. Now let me reiterate - as another pointed out - if you're looking for fancy toppings on your hipster donut than this place isn't for you.

They serve up decadent pastries and their buns are always fresh and fluffy. Prices are very reasonable by any standards. I brought a dozen custards to a dinner and they were a complete hit (crunchy on the outside an silky smooth on the inside). FTW."}
{"text":"Ive only ate their sandwiches and for the price they are good. Lettuce and tomato at 50 cents a piece is a bit much but the overall price of the sandwich makes up for it. Service is hit and miss. If its the younger girls its very very slow where as if its anyone lets say over 28 its spot on. Would make things easier if they just listed there prices. Drip coffee is nothing special.  Solid 3.5 stars and I will continue to return."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that is filled with Brazilian and Portuguese patrons from the neighborhood all the time. It's my go-to bakery for fresh buns, Portuguese sweet bread and a whole lot of yummy treats.

Unlike other yuppie places charging $3 for tarts, this bakery will only take a dollar from you. Desserts are old style, made by one of those mommy-types in the kitchen. Try them with an espresso. 

If you can excuse the staff's influency in English you'll discover that this is a place you end up being loyal patrons of."}
{"text":"I was so surprised with how friendly,  funny,  kind and open the people that hosted us were. We came in for a late night dessert and coffee and we just felt so comfortable in this cozy bakery/grocery/caf√©. Our favorite dessert was the tulip tiramissu,  it was out of this world. The creme flavour was a light sweet citrus that blended perfectly with the smooth fresh creme flavour. The cake base was moist and well balanced chocolate sweetness and all of it was inside a dark chocolate sphere. Such a fantastic treat. 
Again they treat you like family here and that's the most important part. If you're looking for fine dining this isn't your place but honestly I much much prefer this environment where you can connect with people who clearly care about the people that enter their store."}
{"text":"I saw very good review and I tried. It was a nice bakery. They had varieties of products and I could find Brazilian type pastries even Brazilian custard puddings. Their prices are very good. I am not sure about their qualities and taste of pastries. I had been trying Brazilian pastries in many different countries, and I do not think this Brazil Bakery and Pastry is the best."}
{"text":"Amazing display of breads and pastries. We had 4 different pastries inc. a custard tart and two which had an almond paste filling and a kind of sponge cake.  All were very good in flavour and not too sweet. Definitely worth visiting"}
{"text":"When I worked at Dundas and Lansdowne, this was my bakery  for lunch, coffee, etc.
The homemade soup and veal sandwiches with tomato sauce and onions are good, but the pastries tend to be hard as they are kept in the fridge for too long instead of being constantly replenished. The Espresso and lattes are good, but the latter is rather small for the price. If you are in the area and want a coffee or a quick lunch. this place is acceptable. The service is less than spectacular as the waitresses are moody, but otherwise, good to go. Prices are generally acceptable overall.

This place also tends to lack the hipsters that infest some of the surrounding businesses, which is a positive. It instead caters to the blue collar Portuguese and Brazilians in the area, a group of patrons that do not annoy me."}
{"text":"Great custard tarts.  Perfect custard to filling balance.  Perfect sweetness.  They were open late.  Lots of selections for bread and pastry.  Would like to try the coffee next time."}
{"text":"I try to stay away from bread, but I come every Sunday for the Frisbee size Malasadas...So good!"}
{"text":"The basic run down of this place is when you walk in there is a bakery type counter on the right side selling everything from cured meats to desserts and various baked goods, and then bread racks up by the front window. The left hand side of the entrance, serves as the cafe and restaurant. 

I've come here a few times, most recently as a friend wanted to grab a coffee to go, which I believe was about $1.75 for a medium take out cups worth, and the coffee received a good review.

The have pre-made sandwiches in the fridge near the bakery side for $3.80 which are good if you need something quick and on the go (albeit a bit bland due to a lack of sauce). They also have decent paninis and sandwiches that can be made on order from the cafe counter for a couple bucks more. The flavours of everything I've had were good but not generally impressive. But for what you're paying, it's all perfectly fine. 
In full disclosure, I've never been a big fan of their baked breads. I've found that they are way too crusty and dry. I understand there is a natural crustiness normally associated to Portuguese bread, but this stuff just seems overly unworkable. I've also had mediocre results with some of the desserts which didn't seem fresh as they should've been, but that was usually when buying snacks in the evening that likely were made at the start of the day.

All in all, the place is pretty cheap and what I would define as decent but not great. 3 stars!"}
{"text":"My friend told me that people from Brazil are known as \"Brazzers\", I'm not sure if this is accurate or not, perhaps one of you can tell me. Whatever they are called, they make freaking amazing Pasteis De Nata.

What to get: Pasteis De Nata, a Sumol Orange drink, maybe more.
What else: A Pasteis De Nata is a Portuguese Custard Tart, and it will cost you next to Nata.

I've been in love with Brazilian/Portuguese Custard Tarts for years now, ever since I first discovered them in... damn, I can't even remember where. Possibly in Toronto itself at Golden Wheat Bakery.

This place makes an excellent version, not perhaps as perfect as my faves at Progress, Brick Street and Golden Wheat, but it's right up there and easily a five-star bakery.

It's flaky, with a very thin but doughy crust.

If you're lucky for the Dutch bakery you're on the wrong side of the street. You should head over to Pastry Dutchy on the left hand side.

This place is huge (like... never mind) with tons of other options, and masses of drink choices imported from Portuguese-speaking countries such as the excellent Sumol Orange Soda (makes any orange soda made in America taste like crap, which they do anyway - try it), and Guarana sodas of course.

Service is nice, the place is busy and spacious and friendly, prices are okay (not cheap by any means), and it really feels like a little corner of Brazil in the middle of Toronto, which granted is a very Brazilian-influenced city. 

And if your underwear is feeling poorly, count yourself lucky because I have it worse. My bra's ill."}
{"text":"I had some coxinha that it was okay. I expected more, plus it is really expensive 10 coxinhas, one coffee and one water was 30 dollars."}
{"text":"We stopped here to grab some custard tarts but stayed for lunch.  We sat at the tables and the entire bill for Two grilled cheese paninis,  a salad, a veal sandwich and a fried bread donut thing was 20 bucks! Super great deal for the sandwiches.  The custard tarts are so yummy. I think they're around 1$ each."}
{"text":"This is a great place in an area that doesn't have many places to grab a quick bite. My favourite thing is the ability to walk in grab a fresh bun from the racks, go up to the counter and get them to make a turkey sandwich. They slice the meat to order and pack it with tomato, lettuce and Havarti cheese. The best part it's under $5! The have a great selection of grab and go items like cod cakes, chicken balls and meat patties. You can also just order meat and cheese like you would at the deli counter to make you own sandwiches.

You can grab coffee/libation and sit down for a meal as well."}
{"text":"The nata is sweet, and has a custard of a nice consistency. The shell is crunchy and softly flaky. Great to eat on a warm summer day. Get six natas to get them tax free, which is good, but you may want to share the six natas with two or three friends.

Despite the more rugged exterior, the jnside is clean and well furnished. Next time I go to Brazil Bakery I will try some of their other baked goods which also look good"}
{"text":"I've always loved going here and grab a bunch of the Portuguese tarts to go. They sell some of the best Portuguese tarts in the city. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Huge selection, cheap, and authentic. The custard tarts are the best, but don't be afraid to try everything else (although that would take a while).  Not cool, not trendy - just good."}
{"text":"Now that donuts are trendy in Toronto, don't waste your time going elsewhere and paying $3 for a small and dry one with hipster toppings and flavours. The donuts here are simple, perfect, and cheap! 

Cornbread, cod fritters, and custard tarts are all very good quality. One problem is that there are so many items that look delicious and if you have questions the staff isn't always adequately fluent in English."}
{"text":"There are many fresh baked breads and treats here. 1/2 of it is set up like a \"to go\" bakery - the other half is a tiny cafe where you can sit down and a waitress will come to your table and serve you. On that half they have a TV playing with Brazilian or Portuguese television shows. 

As like a lot of places in the Dufferin and Dundas area, this place is very influenced by Portugal. Even though it is \"Brazil Bakery\" - it is more of a Portugal bakery."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favourite bakeries.  Their breads are good and their pasteis de nada quite good.  They are better at the breads (in my opinion) than the pastries.  For authentic Portuguese pastries I go to Doce Minho on Dufferin.  Counter staff at Brazil Bakery are always helpful and polite.  Love their bread buns."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bakeries I like to go to!

If you ask me, you are not going to find much better custards in Toronto, or any Portuguese or Brazilian pastries better than the ones they have. They have a wide variety of pastries, ranging from cakes, to custards, to donuts. I am also a big fan of the cod fish balls which are fantastic with their traditional flaky bread they have. This is always the bakery I go to when I pick up pastries for parties. 

Moreover, I recommend you come here for dessert. Try a custard! 
(Try going earlier in the morning when things are more fresh)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the Pateis de Nata ... I know its Portuguese Custard Tarts but guess what, the Brazilians did a pretty good job.  I've been trying all the Portuguese Custard Tarts in the area and my current reigning favourite is Venezia with Novita, Caldense, and Nova Era all serving up decent versions.  

Brazil Bakery is a large cafe with a take out bakery on the East side with the west side having all the tables and seating.  There is a lot of space so you're never feeling crowded and there windows do offer a lot of natural light in so it's not too dark and cave like.  The bakery does feel a bit dated but in a good way.  It's like time stood still when everyone would come in for their coffee and pateis de nata first thing in the morning before heading into Toronto or on Sundays after church.

The bakery offers a lot of breads and they're all baked in house.  Lots of loaves or buns to choose from the many many racks.  They also have lots of cakes pre made for you or the many sweets ... there is a mountain of cakes, tarts, and cookie types.  

Pateis de Nata - For only $2.80, you get 2 freshly made custard tarts.  That's right... for less then a cup of coffee at a good spot, you get 2 of these!  It's a complete steal especially when across the street you have to pay $5.50 for 1 tart.  Anyhow, these are quite nice... crispy crust that flakes and shatters when you bite into it.  An oozy centre that is more like a molten cake than any firm eggy custard.  It was a novel approach and i do like it.  As for flavour, I found the custard to be sweeter than Venezia and more generically one note (just sweet).  I didnt taste any egg or vanilla.  Still a great pateis de nata!  3.5/5

Definitely come for the super affordable and well made tarts... grab a large loaf while your'e add it.  I saw they do make fresh donuts but they werent there during the week day.  You'll be served quickly and be enjoying your custards with a few pieces of change in your pocket."}
{"text":"I think they have the best custard tarts in the city. It's the pastry, thin and crisp, perfect texture for a massive amount of custard (perfectly caramelized on top)"}
{"text":"I'm rating this place vs other bakeries, not based on it's authenticity/Brazilian-ness.

10 years ago, when my buddies used to live a few doors down, we would come over to Brazil Bakery stoned out of our minds and in desperate need of munchies. I remembered the selection of pastries being vast and extremely tasty. We would grab a dozen of these badboys (I think they did 12 pastries for $10) and gobble them up.

I wandered back here today after asking my old friend to lead me to it.

Even completely sober, this place still got me pretty excited. It was exactly how I remembered. Much bigger inside than most bakeries, with seating on the left hand side of the shop and the pastries displayed on the right. They have lots of fresh bread and buns too. But the pastries/treats are what's really impressive - they have lots!

They have your usual Portuguese custard tarts, donuts, croissants, cookies, brownies and I'd say at least 50 different pastry treats, pannacotta, etc. My eyes were boggling out of my head.

I settled on a small square with oreo cookie crumb bottom, vanilla custard layer and strawberry layer on top with some white chocolate shavings. YUM! 

Do it up, if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"While looking for the \"other\" Portuguese tart place, I stumbled upon this bakery. I've had pasteis de nata in Macau, with their version which I enjoy and other places around town. 

I think this is my fav place for pasteis. 
I'm not sure if it's because the filling here is sweeter or creamier. But it'll def take a side by side taste test.

Decor: Spacious bakery, where you can enjoy a coffee along with other pastries. 

Parking: Easy to park quickly outside and get back into your car within 5 min."}
{"text":"The queijadas de nata are delicious. The custard is creamy and the crust is quite flaky. This is one of my favourite Portuguese bakeries in the city of Toronto."}
{"text":"Food 5/5: home style. Fresh. 

Service 4/5: helpful, attentive, no tip asked.

Price 4/5: $20 for 2 ppl to eat alot.

Location 4/5: right on a main street. parking on the street too. 

Will be BACK"}
{"text":"best custard tarts i've had yet. 
they also sell some affordable prepackaged sandwiches. I only wish I spoke Portuguese so that I hadn't accidentally bought the same fried egg sandwich twice in a row when that was not my intention."}
{"text":"A 24 hour bakery? Yes, please! Brazil Bakery and Pastry is a large bakery/lunch spot in West Dundas. They, of course, make the best of pastries and munchies from Brazil, but they also bake fresh bread and pastries. 

If you like donuts, order their chocolate sprinkle donut. It has a slight lemon taste to it, but after a few bites, you're hooked. It's cheap, moist, and sooooo good!

When we visited Toronto, we'd go here daily...literally."}
{"text":"I stayed at an airbnb in Little Portugal recently.  The guy who was hosting me recommended this place.  I visited every day for breakfast and got coffee and egg tarts.  The service was decent and the coffee was good.  They even had soy milk (a big plus in my book).  The egg tarts were tasty as well.  The outside was flakey and buttery and the inside was eggy and sweet.  It was slightly different from the egg tarts I've had at Chinese bakeries.  On my last day I had the grilled ham and cheese sandwich on flat bread.  It was simple, filling and savory.  I also have to add that this bakery is very affordable.  You can eat well enough and not go broke.  If I ever stay in this area again, I'll be sure to stop by.  You can't go wrong here, if you just want some cheap sweets to go."}
