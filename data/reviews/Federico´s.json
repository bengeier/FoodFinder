{"text":"We were so excited when this place was being built but we're extremely disappointed after multiple attempts in trying to give this place a chance. It does not taste authentic or even well seasoned. Hope you guys get better!"}
{"text":"I usually get 3 rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, a lil stingy but still good, but my concern was the meat normally they're beef tacos and this was chicken I presume but even tasted too soft for chicken... I don't usually like to write reviews but tbh I'm not sure what kind of meat I was eating. The chili carrots were bomb tho staff was pretty friendly"}
{"text":"Omg this chicken enchilada is HORRIBLE. The chicken must have been boiled with tons of jalape√±o. Unbearably spicy I nearly threw up. Never again. I'm done with this location. Usually they are mild. Maybe because it's in el mirage and they like it this way."}
{"text":"Wow, surprised by the other reviews. This place beats their competitors and the staff is friendly. They seriously have good Mexican food for this style of restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible food. My tortilla in my burrito was raw, The beans were runny and bland. My husband ordered beef burrito and they gave him a hamburger patty wrapped in a tortilla. To bad I was hoping to make this our new place."}
{"text":"24 hours? They close at 2. Fix your sign... So annoyed. We really wanted Mexican food too!"}
