{"text":"I've tried a lot of the ramen places in North America. This one was below average. Broth is too thick and creamy. Overpriced. The best ramen in Montreal? Ummmm..."}
{"text":"Best ramen. Just the best. It's the broth, so creamy, so rich. Of course everything else in the bowl was also perfect. The meat was to die for, the egg exactly right, the noodles tender glutinous gems, but that broth just gives life meaning."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Price: $$  A food that hubby and I share love for is Japanese ramen. Authentic Japanese ramen. Sure, Koreans and Chinese have their own unique versions, but our favourite is from the Japanese cuisine. We're always trying new ramen spots to find our new favourite spot, and in Montreal, Yokato Yokabai seems to be it.  We decided to try the ramen house on a whim, wondering if the given high ratings were really true. With no big expectations, we entered Yokato Yokabai quite early in the evening before it got busy. It was relatively empty while we enjoyed our dinner, with more people entering as we left.  The menu is quite simple; there are 2 types of ramen: tonkotsu and kara-miso, with an exception of vegetarian broth. There is no beef on the menu but pork, chicken, and vegetables. You can easily customize everything, from the saltiness of your broth, to how much egg you prefer, whether you want extra noodles or not. Since it was our first time, we decided to have the original portions and we picked a tonkotsu and kara-miso ramen each. We later ordered karaage to share as well, because the original portions didn't fill us up completely.  The menu paper is for 1 person as there is a place to write your name if you prefer. This way, customization is free for everyone and it seems very organized in my opinion. The server doesn't have to write anything down either, so much more efficient.  The ramen house was very small but it indeed felt like we were in Japan for a moment with the textured windows, and instead of having a big kitchen, it was kept simple and many of its condiments were kept at each table for easy access.  There were 4 condiments available: pickled ginger, chili oil, roasted sesame seeds, and garlic oil. I wasn't accustomed to having ginger in my ramen too much, but it essentially balanced everything out in my ramen! Hubby and I loved having the option of adding ginger to our meal, and we kind of wish that it was available in every ramen house. We definitely both liked both the garlic and chili oils as they added enhanced flavours to the broth.  Essentially, the ramens were the same with the exception of the miso paste in hubby's Kara-miso ramen. Anyway, we always taste our broth first before trying our ramen, and to our surprise, it really was authentic, legit Tonkotsu broth! Not sure what Tonkotsu is? Well, a direct translation of tonkontsu means pork-bone broth. It's densely rich with flavour and kind of creamy in colour as you can see above. This broth takes hours to make (literally!) and we're quite familiar with Tonkotsu as Koreans have a similar version of the broth also.  One sip of this broth and we could definitely tell that the broth was well prepared and they were serious about their ramen! We especially loved the soft pork meat also, as it was really delicious and delicate. I also tried the chicken version of the tonkotsu ramen a week later which was just as delicious. We recommend that you add the pickled ginger and have it with your meats as it's really good that way. The cooked egg was very soft and its texture was amazing. I really can't stop about how good it was... so I'm going to stop here to save you time.  We learned later that you can order the extra noodles when you're ready for them. The chefs don't automatically add an extra portion from the beginning as the noodles then would soak all the soup up, leaving you with no broth. So, you can ask your server for extra noodles when you're somewhat finished and ready for some more. The ramen bowls are quite small themselves so they wouldn't have fit all the extra noodles anyway.  We ordered a side of Karaage to share and we really loved the tangy sauce it came with. The portions weren't too small but not too big either, and it seemed fair for the amount of money we paid. We're definitely going to try their chashu-don and desserts next time we're in!  If you visit the ramen house at its busiest hour, you're bound to be waiting for a seat. The small but busy ramen house definitely deserves all the high ratings it's gotten and I know that hubby and I will be back soon for some more ramen, especially with the colder weather coming our way! If you've never been to Yokato Yokabai and you love ramen, you've got to stop by and try this place out. Tucked away on St. Denis, it's easy to pass the small ramen house. This will be our top recommendation for ramen in Montreal from now on!"}
{"text":"Locale carino e giovane. Si differenzia o colloca in 2 stanze: la prima dove si mangia e beve acqua a mo di self service e la seconda che addirittura cambia nome, dove si mangia e beve alcolici. Noi abbiamo mangiato al bancone della prima camera. Personale gentile e paziente. Abbiamo preso il Ramen con maiale e uno vegetariano: quello con il maiale un po' peso e brodo non chiaro come dovrebbe essere, il vegetariano sotto un po' la norma. Locale e cibo ok, ma c'è di meglio."}
{"text":"Best ramen in the city! The closest thing to actually being in Japan. Perfect broth and toppings, and cute servers to boot! The karaage and gobo are also authentic and complex. I recommend this place to anyone wanting authentic Japanese ramen."}
{"text":"To me this was fantastic ramen - the pork broth was so thick that you could almost stand up a spoon in it, and I love fatty pork.  For my wife, those were both reasons she didn't like it as much as I did, so I guess it depends on your taste.  Nice people, too."}
{"text":"Le chef est japonais, et les nouilles ont la bonne texture, la soupe de base est un peu salée mais très crémeuse. Grande portion! Dessert génial! (J'ai choisi la crème glacée de thé vert.) Tout est parfait. Je vais revisiter l'autre jour."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST visit. I ordered the Tonkatsu pork ramen with extra green onion, extra seaweed, and extra soya egg. The broth was very rich, maybe a little bland for me, but still delicious. Please order the kara-age (fried chicken appetizer). It was amazing! And you have to end the meal with a yuzu sorbet. The bits of citrus rind in it gave it an interesting texture and a slightly bitter taste that was perfect with subtly sweet sorbet. Also, if you order multiple items on the menu you save money. You'd be doing yourself a huge disservice if you visit Montréal and don't eat here. Yokato Yokabai is a do not miss!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best ramen shop in town !!! This small but warm ramen shop is on Rachel, near St-Denis. They have a simple menu: two kinds of broth and you choose whether you want it with chicken, porc, etc. I had the chicken Kara-miso ramen and it was delicious. The noodles were cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"So far the best ramen place in Montreal! The broth is rich and flavourful. I ordered less salty broth, which was good. It's hard to find a ramem place whose broth is not too salty. The pork belly is amazing! Order extra if you love pork belly, you won't regret. The karaage was also good but not amazing. Definitely will go back for the ramen."}
{"text":"my new jam.  no knocks except for portion size.  for 12 beans I'd expect even just a little more broth.  probably the best ramen I've had in Montreal and/or Ottawa..."}
{"text":"Very bad first and last experience overall. The vegetable ramens my wife and I ate were not worth the 42$ we paid for at all. On top of the fact that we had to wait close to 1 hour in line to get seated on very dirty sofas. Never going back."}
{"text":"Best broth and best portion size of ramen I've had ever. The thick creamy umami of the tonkotsu with springy noodles and the classic pork and ramen condiments, with choices of sesame, roasted garlic oil, hot sauce, red ginger on the table. This is what I would hope to be authentic Japanese ramen - the place being tucked away definitely contributed to the mysterious ambience.  The waitress didn't seem too happy about what she was doing but she was probably too busy to express her excitement. She did her job.  Homemade Japanese ice cream looked sketchy coming out of a Hellman's mayo bucket, but what doesn't spell \"homemade\" more than that?"}
{"text":"This is a tough one for me because I know Japanese cuisine very well so I'm particularly a tougher critic than most. This is the second time I have ramen in Montreal and it's the second time I get super thick broth. So thick there's barely any liquid. I was glad my food comrades, whom are less critical, agreed and one was even tempted to poor water into the bowl to make it a thinner broth. The flavor was okay and somewhat fine in authenticity (meat flavor was there), but the broth (which is the \"meat and potatoes\" of a ramen dish) was so off and so dense that it kinda defeated the purpose.   Karaage was yummy. Gobou was on point. Salad was refreshing, but the dressing has wasabi so careful if you you're not into wasabi. Service was fine, the guy seemed really busy and a bit overwhelmed. Not particularly the kindest... probably because he was stressed?   The side of the restaurant we were on, we couldn't order alcoholic beverages. A little strange, especially since the other part was full and the only place available was in the booze-free zone.   Again, pretty mediocre experience. Nothing to write home about especially when you've had mind-blowing ramen before. I'll keep trying to find the best ramen bowl in town!"}
{"text":"Pas de superlatifs. Bouffe moyenne, il faut aimer le bouillon. Service courtois, mais confort à voir et ambiance sombre."}
{"text":"I had a tonkosu pork ramen. The noodle was ok but i really cant finish the soup.(was too much fat for me.my friend dont like the pork taste ) .the place was nice."}
{"text":"Found this place by chance, and ended up going there twice on the same trip. There are two parts to the restaurant: ramen and tapas, which have their own entry and hours. Both are popular and there could be a significant wait, or they run out of something. To dine on the tapas side you need to order drinks (I assume has to be alcoholic). Service was good and consistent while food was awesome. Even my kids enjoyed so price wasn't an issue for me."}
{"text":"Delicious broth with juicy tender meat. Service iss quick and friendly. Really glad I gave it a try and will definitely be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time on Monday and the pork ramen was delicious, but then, I went back last night (Thursday) and the same soup was very different. The second time around, it was not nearly as good as the first time; the broth was way too fatty and even a little bland.  The pork belly was not charred at all and it was limp.  So I think there might be a consistency issue here.   Service was also very basic, with a very young and inexperienced waiting staff. Also, when you arrive, they ask you if you plan on drinking alcohol or not and if you do, they direct you to the \"pub\" section at the back of the restaurant, or is it another restaurant altogether? Not sure...   anyway, everything was fine until a family of four with two babies insisted on being seated in the bar section. They were seated riiiiight next to us. There shouldn't be babies allowed in the adult section; I , for one, wasn't in the mood for all the whining and \"baby talk\". Just my opinion. It's kinda sad, but I do have to say there are better ramen spots in town and this one is indeed just another trend (read hype) on the Plateau."}
{"text":"Really really good, simple ramen. The pork is melt-in-your-mouth delicious and savory. Creamy broth. The place is huge, there's a bar section which serves alcohol- a nice list of sake. Very friendly service and amazing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ramen excellents, tout était parfait! J'ai opté pour le Tonkotsu porc. Bouillon crémeux, légèrement sucré, pareil pour le porc fondant qui l'accompagne ainsi que les oeufs, cuits parfaitement et d'une onctuosité exquise. On y plonge avec délice!  Cette version moins épicée permet d'ajuster soi-même l'assaisonnement (huiles épicées, sésame et gingembre mariné à disposition). En somme, des ramen extra réconfort et extra savoureux.  Seul bémol : endroit très petit avec bancs pas très confortables. En été il y fait assez chaud."}
{"text":"Ramen juste parfait! Toujours très très bon! Les entrées sont aussi succulentes, surtout le gobo! L'ambiance est très chaleureuse et intime. Le prix est correct! Attention, il faut venir tôt le soir la fin de semaine, sinon prévoir un peu d'attente... méritée!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in MTL. So good that sometimes I visit my friends in the Plateau just to get an excuse to come eat here. This is the meal I would choose if I was on death row"}
{"text":"Slightly pricy for a ramen but granted, this is one of the better ramens I've had. With regards to the texture of the noddles , I've had better elsewhere, but I appreciate that these are handmade on site. The spicy miso broth , on the other hand will make you keep craving more. It is so good and multidimensioned. I love all the nice condiments that were provided."}
{"text":"We tried everything on the menu and it was simply amazing. The waitor was so nice. I recommend the sake ice cream ?"}
{"text":"Les nouilles sont bonnes mais sinon c'est bien ordinaire. J'avais pris le ramen au porc.  Le porc était en fait deux tranches épaisses de lard, presque aucune viande dans les deux morceaux. Pour le prix ce ne serait vraiment pas un luxe d'avoir un oeuf au complet. Un demi oeuf pour un ramen à 17$ (en comptant les taxes) ça fait cheap. Le bouillon était très épais. Bon service et rapide."}
{"text":"J'ai du mal à comprendre pourquoi ce restaurant a si bonne réputation. J'ai pris une soupe ramen au poulet. Le bouillon a beaucoup de saveur, mais après 3 bouchées, on en peut plus (très gras et salé). 16$ pour une soupe décevante... Je n'y retournerai pas.  Notez qu'il n'y a aucune option sans gluten (pas même un petit accompagnement)."}
{"text":"After being ramen-deprived for a long while, and braving rain, slush and ice to get here, I was hoping that they would offer me amazing food -- and they did. And at such a decent price.   I had the tonkotsu pork ramen: the broth was so creamy and flavorful, which was so different from other ramen soups I have tried... I felt so warm and happy after drinking it! I would suggest ordering it with less salt though - I ordered it with normal and I felt it was a little too salty for me. The meat was really, really tender.   I also had the karage, which was so good. crispy but still moist inside. The dressing is what really elevates it.   Ended it with matcha ice cream, which was perfect for cleansing your palate - makes me wonder if having hot green tea with the ramen would have really helped balance out that creaminess!"}
{"text":"Been there for lunch and had Ramen as well as Karagee (fried chicken) both were very good. The ambiance is nice and the place is clean. In the afternoon you can order the ramen and it's customizable, at night their isakaya is open and they don't serve ramen but seems like another great place to try.  I recommend the Ramen with Pork Belly and load up on the fried garlic."}
{"text":"Food is good, limited options. Went on a weekday (Thursday) and it was busy so there will be a wait. The restaurant is big and has lots of seatings but they still have people wait because they don't use all the seats available (maybe understaffed?)   Also, they rush you out the moment you pay; was asked to leave right after I paid which was rude. Good prices"}
{"text":"This place offers two things - Outstanding service and delicious food. An apparently family run operation with a traditional warm Japanese welcome from all the staff. The quaint room hugs you with the flavour of Japan removing it's diners from the feel of Montreal.   The food is authentically prepared and masterfully presented through balance and artistry.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I really love and appreciate how the Imadake group strives to up the ante on the Japanese food landscape here in Montreal. When I first came here, the Japanese food scene wasn't great so I'd go to NY or TO to get my J food fix. Now these guys are starting to close that gap so my transportation bill can go towards establishments here. :)  I've had bowls of ramen at this joint, but this last time was a bit of a miss. When I saw a bowl coming out, there was one that had nori fall into the soup. Nori not supposed to be soggy, must be crisp which is why it's on the side. It wasn't my bowl luckily. I like my soups HOT especially when it just dropped 10 degrees outside from the day before. That first sip of the broth is supposed to soothe and excite. It was lukewarm at best. Took a bit with noodles and they were hot. So I mixed it around in the broth to distribute the heat, and it was warmer but still not as hot as I'd like it to be. Chashu could have also been roasted or seared a bit more. I look at other photos and some are roasted more.  Yokato Yokabai is hands down the best ramen in town. Is it at the caliber of Ippudo or Santouka? Well, I'll let you be the judge of that. But these guys are shaking the standards, and I just don't want the quality to go down because a few details are being missed."}
{"text":"I think the one word to describe the ramen here is: creamy. Which didn't really bother me since I love creaminess, but it does compromise seasoning and such because of how thick it is. The chicken meat was super tender and delicious though so I would recommend getting the chicken! We came at a relatively good time and was seated and given orders relatively quickly, which was a plus. I also had the green tea ice cream and that was a really nice end to the meal. If you're very much into sour though, I would recommend their Yuzu ice cream. Also, them playing some Nujabes just warms my heart :3"}
{"text":"Best so far in montreal Choice I would like to see on the menu to get the forth star: Extra noodle Bowl of rice Beer"}
{"text":"The Ramen was amazing the kerage was amazing and the service was amazing! I was craving ramen and this place totally hit the spot."}
{"text":"Crazy busy. Very good broth, noods we're avg. Fried Chicken was awesome. Can only drink alc. on one half of restaurant."}
{"text":"The ramen broth is so deliciously thick, you'll likely check out the beautiful mural work by the WC downstairs"}
{"text":"J'avais beaucoup d'attente dû au nombre important d'avis favorable et à la popularité monstre de ce restaurant. La première fois que je suis allé, la file d'attente était tellement longue que je me suis découragé et je suis allé ailleurs. La deuxième fois, j'ai prévenu le coup et je me suis rendu pour l'ouverture. Malheureusement, je suis sortie de là extrêmement déçu et avec un mal de cur!   Le restaurant est très beau et on s'y sent vite confortable. Le service vous offre une belle accueille et est correct en général. Le menu est très simple: soupe ramen seulement, comprenant certains items que vous pourrez choisir selon votre préférence.  J'ai choisi le bouillon Tonkotsu, extra Kara-Miso avec le porc. Le bouillon était très épais et pas si chaud que ça. Rendu à la moitié de mon repas, c'était carrément froid et le bouillon semblait presque figé dans mon bol. Je sais que le flan de porc est gras au départ mais vraiment, il n'y avait pas de viande du tout sur les deux tranches que j'ai eu. Les nouilles étaient bonnes, rebondissantes avec du mordant. Le reste des ingrédients étaient correctes.   En résumé, je n'y retournerai pas. Tel que déjà mentionné, la quantité de gras m'a écuré et m'a donné mal au cur. D'ailleurs, le prix aussi m'a donné mal au cur; beaucoup trop cher pour l'expérience que j'ai eu."}
{"text":"The decor and the food was both very good.  i can see why this is so popular in this neighborhood.     This is very near top notched ramen that are available in Tokyo.  Their home made ramen was definitely a highlight of this place.    Ramen is definitely taking over the world these days!"}
{"text":"Very very thick broth. I personally found it a bit too heavy and thick because it left this really awkward after taste. Noodles were perfect. My friend tried the chicken tonkotsu and I think the chicken was sweet. The sweetness of the chicken didn't match the broth. Pork tonkotsu was really good although I got sick of the flavour at the end."}
{"text":"Solid ramen place...finally! I've been coming here since it opened in Spring 2015 and had it not been for the sign on the sidewalk I would've missed it completely. I am thoroughly impressed and pleased that this has been the best ramen I've tasted in Montreal so far. Quick, top notch service (with surprisingly spacious bathroom area!). The broth is of the right consistency: milky texture, fatty and flavourful. I typically get the tonkotsu with 5 pieces of seaweed and extra soft boiled egg. While they serve you the meal sort of bareboned, the extra free condiments of sesame seeds, ginger, garlic oil and spicy oil are a welcomed touch. I like to add heavy scoops of garlic oil (with the garlic shavings at the bottom) - it makes a huge difference! Chasu meat could use some work in being more generous in giving us more meat and less fat, and soft boiled eggs are marinated, but always too cold upon serving. Otherwise, this is my go-to Ramen shop in the city, and am glad that other people have taken notice of this place, as it is much deserved to be praised. I was a little worried of the lack of patrons when I first went in May, but now it has a healthy night time crowd during weekends. Desserts also deserve a little shout out of tasty treats, the green tea ice cream topped with green tea Pocky sticks is always a nice touch.  **Update Nov 2016** They've greatly improved their chasu meat, it's now thicker, meatier than before, thus I've upgraded it to five stars. It's now so busy, you'll start queueing outside much like how you would stand around for Kazu. Food has been consistently good, so don't miss out on this gem!"}
{"text":"Best ramen soup in montreal! Amazing veggie option! A must visit in montreal! The staff is friendly, the place is cute. I just want to go again and again! Oh its 99.9999999% amazing but.... I could use a cold beer or a sake with my ramen! Maybe they are working on it;) please go and try it!"}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant, themed nicely and all the employees welcome you in Japanese when you enter. There's two parts to the restaurant, one with an open kitchen and another I myself haven't been in, but could see more tables/people eating in there.  The open kitchen area is super hot and humid in the summer, distinct lack of AC and had a big fan as their only air circulation last I went. This isn't really a problem or the restaurants fault, but the humidity and heat can get a little uncomfortable.  Apart from that, lovely service, great food and at a good price. Do recommend, and I will be back :D"}
{"text":"Very simple menu. 2 main dishes with variations, a few snacks and dessert. Legit, fantastic pork bone broth ramen! Before the arrival of Yokato Yokabai there was no real ramen in Montreal. (I tried them all.. we are far behind here)  Check off your choice and ratio of ingredients  (broth type, saltiness, egg, seaweed etc) on a little paper card and let it take on a life of its own.  This is a hot bowl of pure comfort. I can only recommend the tonkatsu broth- as this is their specialty and they do it so well.  Fantastic service! Careful and attentive employees.  The not so good- 2 things- dessert and seating  Dessert- I was really excited about yuzu ice cream the first time I went- as I love yuzu anything, but it was definitely lemon rind flavored, without a hint of yuzu.  A local competitor makes a yuzu beer which keeps us all going back. I'm sure you can deliver on your claims.    This is the best ramen! However, it is not a comfortable place to be. The height and depth of the furniture is kinda off. You have to squeeze by other people and into the seats where your feet will dangle and you can't lean back. I know that a Japanese Ramen House is supposed to have a quick turnover, but this set-up has not been thought out to deliver even that. I'm sure they are losing customers because of it. There are only 3 tables like that however- so if you come alone or with one friend, you can sit at the bar and not worry about it."}
{"text":"The Best Ramen in Town. Great for Lunch or Dinner.  I'm not a Ramen fan. Not at all. But maybe that's 'cause most places don't do it like Yokato Yokabai.  They have two kinds of Ramen on the menu, and they're both killer. It probably has something to do with how they sent the chef to Japan to learn just what the f*ck is up when it comes to Ramen.  In fact, everything on the menu is good. Just do it. Go here, order Ramen and appetizers, and eat yourself into a food coma. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on yelp, my boyfriend and I were excited to go to yokato yokabai.  With a wait of around 30 minutes on a Saturday night for a table and 30 minutes more for our ramen to arrive, what came to the table was unfortunately a sluge of a disgrace which should not have been called ramen.  I order the pork tonkotsu and my boyfriend the chicken tonkotsu.  The broth was slimy, the eggs were cold (it should have at least been room temperature!) and the noodles too starchy and extremely mediocre.  The chicken in my boyfriend's order was also cold.  I honestly don't understand the hype of this place!  Very noisy, service was subpar and the food was just terrible!  This place gets 0 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Wonderful and friendly staff.  They get two stars because it's not the best place for vegetarians.  Only one option on the menu that I found was very disappointing. For a soup that contained two pieces of broccoli, one mushroom and three pieces of tofu I paid $18. I could have easily bought the noddles in the cup from the grocery store instead."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place.   Ramen fan right there. We ordered Tonkotsu Ramen PORK! and Green tea Ice cream.  It was a Monday early afternoon, not crowded. Pretty chill. OMG. Best ramen I had in Montreal so far. Broth SUPER tasty and THICK!  smells good, taste damn good. The pork meat was SUPER TENDER OMGOGMG,  makes me happy ;D The half egg was excellent.  I also tried to add other seasonings to change the flavour of the soup. the fried onions (i think) made a crazy difference.  I almost forgot to mention the SPOON for the soup. OMG I like LOL. Presentation OP. Portion is fine. I wasn't that hungry and end up eating it pretty quickly haha.  The Ice cream green tea tasted sweet and fresh. Enjoyable!  Ambiance is a killing. Dim light. Japanese decoration. Wood style.  Service is great. They speak Japanese :D Waitress told me the ramen was HAKATA-style!  I would definitely go again haha"}
{"text":"The pork on rice was really really good! Ramen soup is thick and we ordered the less salty option which makes it hitting the right spot (thank god they have less salty option). However the noodle is mediocre - just like instant noodles from any grocery store."}
{"text":"My first time eating Fresh Ramen... loved the food... the small menu surprised me but i was totally satisfied. ... food tasted soooo great i have no complaints."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best ramen place in Montreal. Great atmosphere, lovely servers, and just a few blocks from the Mont-Royal metro.   The tonkotsu ramen is fantastic, the pork is melty, tender and full of flavour and the broth is rich and opaque. The noodles are amazing and my egg was done very nicely. Don't pass on the sides either, the karaage is probably the best I've had outside Japan.   Yokato Yokabai clearly takes great care in the food they're putting out and it shows. If you're looking for an authentic ramen experience look no further."}
{"text":"Small restaurant that seems fairly new. Great service and the food was fantastic! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Perfectly decent ramen! The Chicken karagge was delicious. Broth was flavourable and the noodles are cooked just right.   I also loved the simple furnishing and the homely atmosphere - great place to be on a date or with a small group of friends.   The downside is though, I'd expect larger portions and more meat for a bowl of ramen that costs between $12-15. Two slices of pork are not quite enough if they're charging that price range for a bowl. One could easily find a ramen place in Vancouver or Toronto for the same quality, same portions for around $8-10 CAD. But then again, Montreal's not really the city to be if you want to find cheap, decent asian food.   All in all, this place is pretty decent for Montreal standards. But the quality of the ramen isn't enough to make up for the small portions and high price."}
{"text":"Went mid afternoon, was fortunate to be seated next door at the pub. Both places are beautiful. Soup was great, will definitely eat there again when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Word of warning to vegetarians: while there exists a vegetarian version of ramen- the dish tastes absolutely nothing like ramen. The meal I ordered was barely palatable, an oddly disturbing melange of a vegetable soup and ramen noodles. Firstly, ramen should not contain: broccoli, asparagus and cherry tomatoes. Secondly: Asian vegetables already exist and are inexpensive. Why not utilise bok choy and lotus root instead? I could not even finish my meal, it was so disgusting. If you are a vegetarian, give this place a miss.  On the plus side, the setting was spacious and quiet, the service was decent and apparently the meat ramen was good."}
{"text":"It has been while since I came here. Still the best ramen in town. Luckily, we went early enough to avoid long line ups. I strongly recommend to try the appetizer of fried burdock roots. Unfortunately, price has increased and portions decreased. I usually like to take thick noodle, but now it has become an extra. There is even fee for more broth. Still, won't be able to resist the good taste here. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been searching for the best ramen in Montreal for quite a while and I'm happy to report I've finally found the place! The Tonkutsu ramen here is to die for! Everything about it is perfect, and I'll be coming back here many many times."}
{"text":"This was a really good restaurant. We tried going on a Sunday night and the line was out the door. We decided to come back on a Tuesday night which was much better. We tried the following: Pork tonkotsu  -The noodle was really good (wish it had a little more broth).  The egg and everything in it was delicious.  Chicken tonkotsu- dark meat chicken a little on the soft side Fried Octopus ball - you can taste pieces of chopped octopus and the white sauce (Japanese mayo) added a nice touch Fried chicken - nicely season and crispy Steak on hot stone - similar to Korean short rib The first room when you walk in was hot (lack AC), the second room was much better."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance of this place,but the table is tiny and the chair is too high for me?The ramen is the best one by far that I tried in Montreal. And you must get the karaage that is so juicy, crispy and tasty!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this famous Japanese Ramen place. Even my Japanese friends said it is really good! You can choose soup and meat! I love it! The restaurant had two sides. One side is smaller than another one. The smaller one which no alcohol allowed and only serves noodles. Another bigger side could drink alcohol and I have been told by my friend that you can order other dishes too."}
{"text":"I've been to this ramen shop a few times since it first opened. It's only when I got back from my trip to Tokyo that I really appreciated the taste of a Tonkotsu ramen. It's quite rich and the pork is tasty. I go crazy on the green onions, ginger, and garlic. I may sometimes poor some of the water into the soup to dilute it a bit (I do find it a tad salty). Noodles are hand-pulled and always on point.  When I've had enough of the ramen, I'll order either the fried chicken or the bowl of rice with pork belly. Super cheap but doesn't constitute a meal.  It may be worth mentioning, but I've been to this restaurant at different times on different days. The broth was off twice out of the 7-8 times I've been. I'm guessing there was a different cook in the kitchen those days. Still, it looks like it's super popular now."}
{"text":"BEST RAMEN EVER.   The broth is the king. Nothing I've had in Toronto even compares to the flavour here. The noodles are thick, and there's a good amount of toppings.   Though when the noodles came, the spoon was bigger than my mouth so I had no idea how to use it lol.   The menu is easy enough to comprehend. But the staff speak English and are really nice, even if you don't know what you're saying or doing.   I am just so sad that I won't be able here and eat myself into a food coma on the daily."}
{"text":"Amazing food, we would defiantly come back again. We literarily tried everything on the menu and I liked everything. My favourite is their veg noodles (forgot what it's called) but I think it's the second one on the list. Must try!"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen noodle house. Had visitor from Japan, she said it's very authentic and delicious.  Not one drop of soup left in the bowl. Delish!"}
{"text":"Top ramen de Montréal. On n'y va pas pour la soirée, mais bien pour se régaler à la japonaise  vite fait bien fait. Le bouillon est savoureux. Je préfère la version épicée, agrémentée d'un extra échalote avec demi uf. Avec l'entrée prévoyez un gros 12$. 1 minute, 1 dollar ?"}
{"text":"Seriously what is up with this place now? Used to be good (for montreal ramen, which ain't saying much) but they've started to cheap out it's nowhere near as good as it was a year ago. The fact that they blame their customers instead of actually figuring out what went wrong with their order is also messed up. Also, get some air conditioning and a liquor license - hot and thirsty is not a good combo.   Can't wait to see how crybaby Kev responds.  --- update ---  Kev baby (or baby Kev not sure which you prefer). Since you don't have a liquor license or air conditioning and since you have only whined instead of actually investigating what happened in your restaurant I can only assume that when you say it's not ok to post lies that you're talking about yourself and this is some kind of mild public self flagellation? It's okay baby, put a few more veggies in your soup and buy an air conditioner and it'll all be better. Shhhh."}
{"text":"We arrived early and we had to wait in line about 30 minutes which was just fine. the place was packed.  vibe was great...we sat at the bar watching everybody work it was awesome. we ordered tonkatasu.   and fried chicken. we wanted to lick the plate after we ate the fried chicken. it was that good. The Tonkatsu was excellent.full of noodles hot steaming broth great on a cold day would definitely come back and eat all the chicken they have."}
{"text":"We went here on a Thursday night around 5:00pm when they first opened for evening. The restaurant seems small and tight when you first walk in however it extends pretty far back with additional floors upstairs and downstairs.   We ordered the Karaage Chicken, Tonkatsu Ramen, and the Spicy Miso Ramen - both with \"Normal\" saltiness, \"Regular\" noodles, and \"Char Sui Pork\". I thought the broth was a little bland. Maybe if I selected \"More Salty\" instead of \"Normal\" it probably would have been more flavourful. I didn't care for the texture of the noodles either. It didn't taste like authentic Japanese ramen noodles, but more artificial and chewy. I asked the waitress for a glass of hot water and Shichi-mi t?garashi for my noodles but they didn't have any. What kind of ramen restaurant doesn't have Shichi-mi t?garashi or hot water for that matter??? She said they only have green tea...ummm okay. On another note, the Char Sui Pork was super tender. I would say the pork was the highlight of the dish. The Karaage chicken was a tad oily but still tasty. The service was okay, nothing to write home about.   Overall, I would come back again on a cold night if I was craving for something warm and soupy but the next time I will order the \"More Salty\" broth or try some of their other items on the regular menu."}
{"text":"Best tonkotsu ramen in Montreal.  It's LEAGUES above the other places downtown despite the similar yelp rating.   Their karage is a little sweet, a little salty, a little sour (balances out the grease), and all around delicious.  Fried Gobo is also excellent."}
{"text":"I was in town for a long weekend and this ramen joint was near the AirBnB I was staying at so decided to get a quick bite. I went a warm day and the inside of this place was a bit on the hot side, probably from all the ramen broth boiling. Luckily, they had a backroom which was just as roomy and much cooler. Yokato Yokabai is a nicely designed ramen shop with both bar and table seating. Service was exceptionally friendly here. Orders are taken by marking off what you want on a piece of paper which is simple and easy in my opinion. I went with the tonkotsu ramen with extra char su. This ramen comes with the thin straight noodles which is traditionally served with tonkotsu styled broth. I do however prefer the thick and wavy noodles. I wish they provided that as an option. When I got the ramen shortly after ordering, I found the flavors were on point but the broth was way too thick. Rather than being a broth, it was more like gravy.  It was so thick I was tempted to dilute the broth with water. The char su was thick but a bit limp.  It didn't have any char on it. It was more like a boiled piece of sloppy pork belly meat. I would recommend that they broil it under a hand torch for a minute or two before serving. I was also able to sample the chicken karaage which was nice and crispy on the outside and juicy on the outside. Overall, I've had better ramen however this place isn't a bad option if you are seriously craving ramen and are in the area. And again, service was super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Favorite ramen spot in Montreal! You can choose the level of saltiness in both types of broth, which is a huge plus for me. MUST try the gobo root appetizer - super crunchy, crispy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent. L'attente a valu la peine!"}
{"text":"We arrived right as it opened at noon and were seated right away. After we ordered the place filled up very quickly and a line started to build, so you can tell this place is very popular.   The order card was fun so you get to personalize your ramen. There was a good assortment of drinks and ramuné, which is a really fun Japanese soda (get the classic \"original\" or \"grape\")!   I recommend going to the restroom while your there so you get to pass where they make their noodles downstairs!  The matcha ice-cream was the perfect intensity of matcha flavor.   Will definitely recommend to a friend and try to go back asap to try more of the food there."}
{"text":"I kept seeing and hearing things about this tiny little ramen joint, and when I had the opportunity for a few kid free hours, and wanted to maximize my time, I decided it was time to check it out.  Am I glad I did!  This is one swanky little hole in the wall, well decorated and playing chill music.  I loved the ordering system of filling out the little paper with my choices (why don't more places do this?), and then pretty quickly afterwards I was staring down a steaming bowl of noodle goodness.  This is comfort food to the max! Service was unobtrusive yet efficient, just the way I like it!  I do have to comment on the bathrooms.  Getting to them felt like a little adventure.  Down a few steps, around a corner, past a window looking into another dining room, a few more steps, another corner and on and on.  The restaurant has put up lots of little signs so you don't get lost.  I alternate between being amused and a little bit annoyed. What about people with mobility issues?  If the couple of steps out front didn't deter them, I sure hope they don't have to go to the bathroom!  I will definitely be back, that's for sure.  The location is perfect for ducking in for a quick lunch while shopping on St Denis."}
{"text":"\"It's not you. It's me.\" This is what I kept telling myself throughout my meal here.   To be honest, it's probably both of us. For starters  I have to admit I'm just not a fan of this style of ramen, which is extremely rich and fatty. I'm more of a lighter broth kinda gal, and I really enjoy when ramen is packed with different veg and garnishes.   I tried the tonkotsu-miso ramen. The broth was so heavy in pork fat, that it was essentially white and tasted like lard. I'm told by many that they love it, so I think it might just depend on your taste. I was also disappointed by the lack of diversity in the soup, which was lacking soup garnishes and vegetables to complete it. The two slabs of pork were so fatty, I could barely finish them. Extra veg options, like corn, would definitely be welcome.   As for the space, it has a fun Japanese bar style, with wooden stools and cute seating area. The service was also prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Its a cute tiny place with the best ramen ever. No words can describe how tasty it is. You kinda have to wait a bit before you have your soup but its SO worth the wait. Their icecream is delish also"}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had in Canada, and top 3 outside of Japan.  This ramen shop feels authentic...it's tiny and you can see the chefs cooking the ramen in front of you. They even have the big wood handled soup spoons! Service was lovely.  The menu is simple but there are also desserts and other small dishes. If you don't read French, just flip the menu over for the English side. It took us a minute to figure that out lol.  Another tip...if there's a line make sure to get your name and party count on the clipboard. Squeeze through to the cash register to find it hanging underneath. Oh yeah, and there's free wifi!  The restaurant is connected to a tapas restaurant under the same owner. I was told you can only order ramen in the ramen side of the building.  The ramen itself was excellent. We both ordered the tonkatsu broth (they also have spicy miso and veg). I chose chicken instead of pork or veg topping, with regular green onion and less sodium. You get half an egg for free. In hindsight, I would have ordered double noodles and regular sodium but I still enjoyed every bite! Other toppings are also available for a charge.  The noodles are thin and go well with the broth, which is flavorful and not too fatty. The half egg was delicious and a perfect portion. I also added some of the chili oil to taste and pickled ginger from the condiments jars (wasn't sure if that was what it was meant for but I enjoyed that extra kick).  I would definitely recommend to anyone in town wanting some ramen!"}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant twice now: it's really the best ramen one can find in downtown Montreal. Still doesn't live up to the greatness of Ippudo or any of its franchises, but it's very enjoyable in itself.   Both times I've ordered ramen with the tonkatsu broth, with more salty soup, extra green onion, and pork belly. Second time, I ordered extra pork belly: be sure you're prepared if you ordered this, because I think they gave me more than double the regular portion! Bamboo shoots are also a very nice, thoughtful addition that I wouldn't normally find in ramen restaurants here. Would also recommend adding the fried garlic in the provided condiments on the table. Broth was thick and flavorful, noodles were pretty ordinarily good, spoon was a little annoying to use but not a huge problem. I also split the chicken karaage, which was very good (especially with that dressing), but not as worth it to me given the portion size and the price. Be sure to try the yuzu ice cream, because it's impossible to find elsewhere: really is a treat, even if you're stuffed.  Ambiance is nice, and the service is good, nothing out of the ordinary. Walking into the restaurant itself can get you really hungry. One of the best parts is that from the outside, it's really understated! I'm a fan of the high tables/booths too, but I've only been in the non-alcoholic section.  Only complaints I can give are that it's a touch expensive for a college student, but worth it as a pick me up. Also, possibly just me, but I would have loved a little more soup in my bowl. Otherwise, portion sizes are big and hearty. I recommend this place to all of my friends!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Bon service! Beau sauf que les banquettes ne sont pas confortables."}
{"text":"Came here late at night on Friday but still had to wait over 30 min. Best thing to do is put your name on both side of the restaurant and cancel one when you get a seat. The two sides are basically the same (i think one side you can get alcohol)  The food was mediocre.. definitely had much better ramens for cheaper.. was pretty disappointed that we waited so long for a meh dinner.   We also got the karaage but they forgot about it. So it came after we were done with our ramen."}
{"text":"Prompt service and great price, although the portion isn't quite filling comparing to other ramen places."}
{"text":"My first ever authentic ramen experience..and it was to die for! Super easy menu, very reasonable prices..and some of the best fried chicken ever! Also love their collection of Japanese sodas. Super fast and friendly service too! Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian ramen - the best I've had! Flavorful broth with lots of good toppings. The egg was rich and creamy. Service was a bit slow, but the food came quickly once we ordered."}
{"text":"True hakata ramen, the broth is delicious and so was the yuzu sherbet. What's not to love !"}
{"text":"Located on a quiet street that is almost all residential. So happy to find amazing Asian food in Montreal! Plus it's walking distance from the place that we were located as a tourists. If you visit the ramen house at its busiest hour, you're bound to be waiting for a seat. The restaurant is quite small, only a few tables.  Best broth and best noodle of ramen I've had ever. Easy to realize the difference between fresh homemade noodles that they have here versus the premade and dry noodles that usually other places serve. Apparently family run operation with a traditional warm Japanese welcome from all the staff, overall, this is a great izakaya-style ramen house."}
{"text":"We arrive to Montreal late. La banquise and the other poutinery were a nightmare of a line up at 10pm. Luckily we found this Ramen place that turned out to be super tasty. The eggs were moist. Flavor was addictive. We ordered a tonkansu chicken and pork. We would order it all over again"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 Service: 4.5/5 Ambiance: 5/5  I'm so glad I got to stop by this little gem during my visit to Montreal. I don't know if I was simply ravenous or if the ramen was just that good, but it was REALLY good. Being from the NYC/NJ area, I've had my fair share of really good (and really bad) ramen. In addition, I've been to Japan and had some great authentic ramen over there too. I'm clearly no expert, but this is one of the better places I've been to in a while.  I got the tonkatsu ramen broth with pork belly and thin noodles. The noodles were cooked perfectly and really held the thicker broth, so you were getting a full burst of flavor all at once. I also really like that you can choose the saltiness level of the broth.   I loved the decor inside, and I'd say this is a great place to visit for a casual lunch on a weekend. It's definitely a must-visit!"}
{"text":"On a attendu super longtemps, toutefois cela valait trop le coup! La soupe de ramen et les appetizers de morceaux de poulet assaisonnés étaient excellents. La glace au yuzu ne m'inspirait pas, pis finalement quand j'ai plongé la première cuillère, j'ai été transportée au paradis de la glace. Yummy! C'est un endroit charmant et cozy même si ce n'est pas super grand cela vaut vraiment le détour! Merci à mon ami Rym pour cette splendide recommendation."}
{"text":"As someone who tends to only* appreciate ramen in Japan or Hong Kong, I have to say that Yokato does a great job in creating an authentic ramen experience especially in Montreal.   I always choose the less salty broth, as their tonkotsu is quite rich. It is very hearty and genuinely tasty. Their pork chashu is always great quality and well cooked (yum for meat lovers!).  Because their tonkotsu soup is so rich and filling I would definitely wish that they provided some vinegar to cut the heaviness of the pork."}
{"text":"I have to say the soup was delicious but unfortunately everything else about our dinner was so disappointing that I'm not sure I'll be back. 1) there were about 12 people in line patiently waiting at the entrance of the Ramen house. in the meantime some clients arrived via the Izakaya entrance (situated on the underground level of the same restaurant) and the waiter let them cut everybody else in line to eat at the ramen house right in front of our eyes. that happened 3 times (so 6 people altogether) I talked to the waiter close to us about it and he apologized, said it shouldn't happened but he couldn't do anything about it now they were sitting (literally 5 sec before) 2) after waiting 40 min for our table because of all that, we finally ordered. 20 min later a waiter arrived with soup bowls, left one in front of one of us, looked confused then left. came back more than 5 min later and took the bowl away in front of my friend and said \"it's for the table next to you\" (!!!!) no excuses whatsoever. our food arrived 10 min after. what would have happened if he already started eating it?? 3) When we ordered we mentioned my husband allergies. the waitress said it was safe. Yet right after eating his Tonkotsu chicken ramen, my husband had a severe allergy reaction. We still don't know what caused it even after calling them. Overall I'd say it was a pretty horrible experience for us."}
{"text":"Un très bon ramen. Le choix est assez simple et rapide : une base de ramen, il faut choisir entre poulet, porc et l'option végétarienne. Puis on peut choisir l'ajout d'un oeuf, de champignons, oignons verts et d'algues.  Le bouillon est crémeux. Le restaurant a une décoration sympa, quoiqu'un peu sombre.  Really good ramen. The choice is simple : you can choose between chicken, porc or the vegetarian option. You can add an egg, seaweeds, green onions and mushrooms. The broth is creamy. The decoration is really cool but a liitle bit dark."}
{"text":"Best ramen in town everybody! We went there on the recommendations of mutual friends of ours and, boy, I'm glad we went all the way there. Watch out as the restaurant doesn't stand out at all and could be mistaken for a private apartment. But that's part of the charm as well. We ordered some fried chicken to start and enjoyed it a lot but the best was yet to come.  The ramen bowls were amazing and I say that knowing that I went to Japan and ate a lot of them. I had the same feeling at Yokato Yokabai. If you want some Japan in your Montreal just go there! You won't regret it and you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I came on a Saturday night and the service was fast and friendly. The food was amazing! Best ramen I've had so far. I also recommend the delicious green tea tiramisu :)"}
{"text":"Meilleurs ramens en ville. Leurs bouillons ressemblent au bouillon que j'ai goûtés au Japon, un peu gras et salé avec un goût bien prononcé de la viande.  On avait été en mars 2016, en plein hiver, c'était un plat parfait pour les soirées un peu trop froides."}
{"text":"Only authentic ramen I've had since moving to Montreal.  The broth is lovely and the noodles are perfectly chewie. They also have lovely soy eggs. The chashu I found a bit thin, but overall really nice. One thing they should definitely consider adding to the menu: Tsukemen Ramen and offering an extra serving of noodles for the broth. Other than that, really lovely."}
{"text":"This place is one of my fave places for ramen. You can customize your ramen according to your taste and they have a few choices or appetizers. My fave is the gobo fries. The best is the spicy broth with chasu pork (so tender).   I wouldn't recommend this place if you're with a big group of friends, as places are limited and it is hard combine the seats for 4 or more people. We waited 2 hours once because we were 8 people and they had to wait for some tables to clear up at the same time.   Overall, would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen !!!  On dirait que le restaurant est fermé de l'extérieur, mais n'ayez pas peur de pousser la porte ! Foncez même"}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night around 8 and the place was packed and we had to wait for like an hour! I had the vegetable broth ramen with chicken, it tasted pretty good. It's a great place to take a date to because of the warm ambience. I cant say much about the authenticity of this place since i haven't had a lot of Japanese food.  Update: the pork broth ramen is very good. Thick broth. But they do not offer thick noodles after 6pm"}
{"text":"Pretty good ramen, thick soupe with thin noodles. Service was pretty good, good value."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype. Some of the best ramen I've had and definitely the best chashu (pork) I've had. Every bite melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. The broth is quite thick - I recommend getting the extra miso spice. Makes it quite flavorful. Will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Les meilleurs ramen mangés à vie, le bouillon est riche, crémeux et incroyablement goûteux. L'extra uf en vaut vraiment la peine, ils sont toujours cuits à la perfection et ayant baignés dans le ramen, ils en prennent le goût."}
{"text":"THE BEST ramen I have ever had.   Broth- At first I was worried that there was not a lot of broth, but after one sip I understood why. Their broth is twice as thick as most other places! The amount they give is just perfect, after finishing the entire bowl it is just enough too satiate, but not too much as to make you queasy with the heaviness. Could definitely taste the pork bone. Normal salt was very savory.   Pork cha shui- melt in your mouth, perfect flavor.   Egg- I cannot get over how good the egg is.  It has just the right amount of the slightly sweet flavor of Japanese soy sauce. I asked and they said it was marinated, first time I ever encountered a ramen place that puts so much thought into the egg!  Noodles- only component that I would not give full marks on. I prefer noodles more chewy, and theirs, while not limp like many other ramen places, are not quite powerful enough. Would suggest adding a bit of salt to the dough and/or kneading it longer to perfect the noodles.   Other condiments- seaweed was so good. Added bamboo which was also good. Chili oil on the table not super spicy, ended up adding about 5 spoons.   Sake ice cream- first time ever having something like this! Super interesting flavor, but I felt it was a bit too icy and not creamy enough."}
{"text":"I would normally have given this place more stars, but I just picked up my vegetable ramen and got it home to find that they have substituted the usual asparagus, cherry tomatoes and broccoli with a single veggie: corn. I called to find out what was up and they said, \"We changed the recipe.\" Are you guys for real? [turd emoji]  [Edit] in reply to Kevin: no, there were no mushrooms and no green beans. Yes, there was lotus root and green onions (those strike me more as garnishes though). The changes you have made to this dish are terrible and make the restaurant come off as really stingy. In short: the soup was awful. Which is a shame, because it used to be really good. (And I'll add that the arrogant way that you handle complaints could use some work. In the restaurant business, current success is no guarantee of future success.)"}
{"text":"We stopped here for an early dinner on Saturday night. When we first arrived we had to wait some time, even though the other half of the restaurant had open seats at the bar. The wait staff was slow, and not particularly hospitable. The ramen was good, with a flavor that I quite liked. Overall the pricing seemed a bit high ($17 total with tax for one ramen order)."}
{"text":"I like this place. Is it just me or Montreal food taste so goooood, but so expensive. At least the currency exchange haha!   The pork is a little fatty so if you don't like that then get chicken. My friend left half his pork because he thought it was too fatty. In that moment, we all said \"how can you waste meat??\"  Service is a little slower, but many places I go were like that and they just opened plus there was a huge table ahead of us."}
{"text":"Belle découverte ce soir que ce petit resto presque invisible sur Drolet, coin Rachel. C'est petit alors il faut arriver tôt si on n'aime pas attendre, mais de toute façon, l'attente en vaut la peine. Nous y sommes allé un jeudi vers 17h45, avant un spectacle, et il restait 6 places au comptoir. L'endroit s'est rempli très rapidement mais, même rempli, l'ambiance y était agréable et relax. Le service était impeccable et les employés symphatiques.  Le repas fut vraiment excellent. Le poulet karage est le meilleur que j'ai mangé! Et que dire du bouillon de leur ramen. Goûteux, crémeux, parfait! Allez y!!"}
{"text":"This was a great experience . We had spicy ramen and traditional . We also had the chicken tapas and green tea ice cream. We got to the spot 13 mins after the midday closing and we begged that they let us eat (we used our NY foreigner card as sympathy hehe ) it worked and we will be back. Our family who lives in Montreal was sold on the food and state that they will be bringing friends.  Give this place a try ! We loved the staff !!!"}
{"text":"I've tried many veggie ramen options in Montreal and few have come near to the flavor of this broth. Warm and rich with the right amount of saltiness (you can choose your desired salt level - I ordered mine normal). The noodles had good texture and all the accompaniments were delicious. Almost everything, including the garlic and chile oils on the table are made in house. The only thing on the wish list is a veg friendly sous-vide egg. For dessert we tried the green tea ice cream, a favorite of the server, and he did not steer us wrong. Not overly sweet and filled with a pleasant green tea flavor. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The tonkotsu ramen was very good.  I chose less salt, but the noodles were a tad on the saltier side.  The flavours from all the ingredients together was quite nice.  The broth was nice and creamy, but not too thick.   The yuzu ice cream was also quite good, if a bit sour.    Overall, very good ramen place."}
{"text":"One of the best place to eat ramen in Mtl. The service is fast, the food is very good and you will want to come back. The art it the basement is amazing :)"}
{"text":"Entrance is just around the corner on Drolet as you walk up Rue Rachel, building no. 4185... right next to a white residential car garage... not very conspicuous especially in the evening... and when it's located in the residential neighborhood. If you still can't find it, look for people waiting and standing on the sidewalk.  There is something about the ramen here at Yokato Yokabai... it was late, nearly closing time actually, and we couldn't help ourselves from devouring bowl after bowl of Tonkotsu ramen. Three bowls per person if someone was counting... were we hungry, maybe... was it that good, certainly... something in Canada's water that makes tasty ramen broth, who knows."}
{"text":"Trip 2 A small ramen bar tucked away in what looks like a small apartment building. Very cheerful Japanese music. Simple menu which is what ramen bars should be like. Five ramens and four sides to choose from. Not one of those restaurants with countless pages of ramen styles which makes me confused. Friendly staff. Karaage was really tasty. Made to order. Crispy with a warm, tender centre with sprinkles of seaweed and sesame seed. The ramen was well presented. It had two pieces of pork belly...it should come with three pieces. The egg was tasty, salty with a soft, creamy yolk. The pork belly was bland and limp. The noodles were too thin! It felt like eating Chinese egg noodles, I think it may even be just that!   The Karaage saved this place but the ramen was a disappointment! Does not compare to Toronto or New York. Where is a good ramen place in Montreal?"}
{"text":"Ne venez pas ici si vous cherchez des bonnes ramens. Venez ici si vous cherchez des ramens incroyables !!  De loin les meilleures de ... de la vie !! :)"}
{"text":"Tried the miso tonkatsu ramen for lunch.  The good: - Broth is quite tasty. They even allow you to request how salty you like it, which is nice considering there seems to be a lot of variety in saltiness in ramen broth in town. - Service is friendly and attentive. - Decor is modern and comfortable. - Prices are on the high end for ramen, but still reasonable. - Pork was very tender and tasty.  The meh: - Music was some crazy 90s dance music remix, Japanese style. Kind of aggravating, but I'm a bit of a music snob. - Noodles were quite thin. Not the kind of ramen noodles I'm used to. I prefer mine with more bite and more body. Not particularly satisfying. - A little modest on the portion sizes. - Soft boiled egg came straight out of the fridge, so it was still cold.  With the proliferation of ramen places, it's tricky to choose sometimes. For choices in the Plateau, I definitely prefer this over Ramen-ya, Misoya, and Saka-ba, but Kazu still takes the prize for me."}
{"text":"Alright! There is a lot about this restaurant that has already been said. It's my go-to ramen place in Montréal, and there's definitely a lot to love.   You make your order on small sheets of paper, and the waiter will come around and collect them. I love their Tonkotsu ramen, which is made with a pork marrow bone broth. Delicious! You can customize your ramen with the degree of saltiness, amount of seaweed and eggs, and amount of green onions.   They've changed their menu slightly, and now serve extra noodles on the side when you're ready for them. If you want extra noodles, don't forget to leave some broth so you're not eating brothless noodles.   The restaurant has a great ambiance to it, and the service has always been fast and amiable. I've never tried their gobu fries, so that's something I look forward to during my next visit!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've had the pork belly ramen - delicious! Pork belly is tender, broth is not too salty, noodles are tasty, and the portion size is perfect. And reasonable pricing! Not a lot of seating in the main room, best not to have a lot of stuff with you.  Will be coming back for a third time."}
{"text":"It's delicious! I tried the kara miso pork and my husband tried the chicken one. Both of them were so nice. The small cozy place. They have some small stuffs and you can enjoy while you're waiting for your ramen done (took about 10m). I had karaage chicken and I was so in love with.  Definitely comeback"}
{"text":"Great spot. Very tasty. Fast & efficient service. Portions are a tad small but packs a great punch. Order everything. Can't go wrong. Prepare to wait in line during prime time"}
{"text":"J'avais lu de nombreux articles concernant les ramens de ce restaurant et j'avais vraiment hâte d'y aller!!! Malheureusement, pour ma part, j'ai trouvé le bouillon fade, cela manquait de beaucoup de saveur. Alors oui il était super onctueux et crémeux, mais aucun goût ! Le reste était très bon , mon entrée de riz  Avec Des morceaux de porc et le poulet karage , les toppings du ramen étaient normaux ... mais decue par le manque de saveur du bouillon. Alors peut-être qu'au Japon le bouillon est traditionnellement fade comme ça? Peut-être jen sais rien... mais j'ai goûté mieux donc voilà ! :-)"}
{"text":"Was craving for ramen and decided to try this place as it had many good reviews.  Went there around 1730 on a Wednesday evening, good ambiance, not too crowded. Unfortunately, place didn't have any highchair, we were disappointed as it meant we had to watch over our 15 months toddler while trying to eat our ramen.. we tried their booster but I was still distracted in watching over my son not sliding down the chair.  Food was just ok. Also not many food option for kids..  ordered fried chicken plus 2 ramens. Their broth was creamy but very heavy. Meat was well cooked, flavourful and tender but their broth was a bit bland (had better ramen with better toppings). We thought it was overpriced, total of 50$ for ramens and fried chicken. It was good but would not return."}
{"text":"Was visiting the city and saw this was a top rated food spot. We got to the place and had to wait about an hour (table for 6). While approaching the front of the line they give you little papers to make your orders.   I ordered the chicken kakaage and it was AMAZING. It was crispy with ponzu sauce. Then I got the tonkatsu ramen with pork and some extras. It was good. The noodles are thin and similar to spaghetti. The broth had a creamy consistency. It was good but I wasn't blown away by anything but the pork. Seared so good! I would def recommend this place!. For the size of the portion it was well priced."}
{"text":"So delicious! Best ramen I have ever had. I loved the ability to customize how much and which ingredients! Can't wait to go back on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"I really have no frame of reference for this food. I can, however, say that it's delicious. The service was fast and friendly. The food was hot and delicious. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I get what all the hype is about now, at long last. The first two times I came to this place, I let them talk me into getting the pork broth with a bit of spicy kara-miso in it, and each time I was a bit disappointed. The broth was super tasty but I found it odd that it was so lukewarm instead of hot (maybe because of the miso paste), and I found the milky texture a bit off-putting. I could tell it wasn't bad, just not my thing, which bummed me out, because I've wanted a good ramen place for a while now.   So, last time, I got the veggie broth with chicken, no kara-miso paste, and it was FANTASTIC, with just the kind of flavour profile I wanted, and a rich, clear broth served piping hot. Best ramen I've had in ages, maybe ever.   The moral of the story: if this place doesn't grab you the first time, give it another shot and switch up your order. They're obviously very proud of their pork tonkotsu and spicy miso paste, but those aren't going to be to everyone's tastes. Besides, the prices are pretty good and the selection is quite small, so it's easy enough to experiment a little."}
{"text":"Came here last night with a large group of friends!   SO happy to finally have some decent asian food in Montreal! Plus it's walking distance from home.  They're only open for dinner/evening, not sure if they're going to open up for lunch (but I really hope they do :P)  Very friendly and welcoming staff, super easy ordering (just fill out a little form), and a nice small menu. A smaller menu means they can concentrate on quality.  I had the tonkotsu pork, chicken karaage and the green tea ice cream!  The ramen is solid and delicious, garnished with green onion, sprouts and mushroom. Nice fatty pork, and of course a soy egg. Good, hearty broth.   The karaage is PERFECT. I could eat a bucket of this stuff and I'm contemplating ordering more than one next time. It's a great portion for the $4 though.   The green tea ice cream was OK, needs a little bit more sugar for my tastes, but is garnished with a matcha syrup and pocky! I heard rave reviews about the yuzu and will try it next time.  I will for sure be back, but am a little nervous as this place is totally going to blow up."}
{"text":"Love the ramen and octopus balls. Excellent ambience for dates . Should order sparking sake!"}
{"text":"It used to be on my to-do list..not anymore... I have visited several Japanese restaurants here in mtl. The amount of regular bowl is really small to me.... No thing special abt the taste. At least not as good as the comments (I personally don't like it) I won't recommend it to my Asian friends seriously. But given to it's high reputation, you may regret to not having had a meal here, so that you can have your own judge."}
{"text":"Good (but small)bowl of ramen.  I would skip any add-ons for your first bowl. I would rather have a side than adding 2 strips of pork for 3$  The soup was a 3 star, but what makes it a 4 is how everything, the decor to the cleanliness is on point."}
{"text":"What a great place for ramen! Kara-miso was flavourful and large enough to feed a hungry traveler. I went with no extras portion and it was all I could wish for on a rainy day! Definitely will come back when I'm in the area:)"}
{"text":"Correct sans plus.  Nous y sommes allé à plusieurs et avons lors pu essayer quelques plats. Sur la près de 20ène que nous avons commandés nul, bien que ce n'était certes pas mauvais,  n'aura su susciter un Wow... Il existe nombre de resto offrant un bien meilleur rapport qualité-prix-satiété que celui là... Qui pour moi est un peu le Hooters version Hipsters où en lieu de poitrines ce sont des cuissettes de midinettes  dont on fait étalage...."}
{"text":"After all the hype about this place I decided to give it a try. It was my first time so I opted for the chicken tonkotsu and karaage. The karaage was perfectly crisp and the sauce on it was great Now for the ramen: I honestly thought it was flavorless, it pretty much tasted like cream. The broth was extremely underseasoned. The only redeeming factor was the sweet chicken in it which was good. The service was very friendly but overall I would not come back here."}
{"text":"I had the Kara-Miso Pork and it was absolutely delicious - the best Ramen I've had outside of Japan! I would highly recommend and definitely going back soon. Also loved that it is a cute, small restaurant with an open kitchen. Very happy about discovering this gem!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a hot bowl of ramen. Menu is simple but the quality of the food is really good. Not too fatty, good ratio of noodles to pork. I wouldn't recommend it for large groups tho as it can be pretty tight. Also, no alcohol which is a bit surprising. Otherwise it's a great place to visit."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place!  Definitely authentic and homemade ramen!  The best I've tried!  The best part is that you don't have to worry about it being served piping hot - you get to enjoy it from the second the bowl is placed on your table - no blowing on the noodles before putting it in your mouth needed!  The ordering is so simple - there's an ordering slip at each table where you select your broth/toppings, four appetizers to choose from, and a dessert... there is option for a rebate when ordering a minimum of three items.  There's even a box you check-off to say you want the broth to be less salty!  The decor even convinces you that you're eating authentic ramen.  The noodles are just so fresh and soft!  It is a small place, just don't be discouraged of coming in since it's at a corner of a busy intersection... Your experience begins the moment your foot is in the door :)."}
{"text":"After a long night of watching of youtube of ramen houses in new york I just had a bad craving for a bowl of Tonkatsu ramen. The craving for Tonkatsu soup base, that's creamy and thick that coats inside your mouth when you drink the broth. Seeing the ramen noodles coated with the broth, the moment I slurp into my mouth is that warm feeling like being in bed with a warm blanket in a cold winter day.  I went to a few Ramen houses in montreal and none of them were tummy warm satisfaction. Until I located this hidden ramen house on corner of Drolet and St-Denis called Yokato Yokabai.   When I first passed by the Ramen house there wasn't a big sign but lots of great drawing on the front door. I arrive there on a snowy day afternoon lunch there was no line up. The moment I walked inside, was a warm feeling of smell in the air. They greet us in japanese and welcome us do we wanna have alcohol or not. Cause if you want to drink alcohol you have to go to Ichigo Ichie japanese pub connected to the Yokato Yokabai. No drinks for me. The interior was really traditional Japanese pub. Matches well with the menu. You gotta see the bathroom!! First you gotta find it in the basement.  So I sat right next to the opened well ventilation open kitchen where the action is. I think I had the best seat in the house for person like me. You order your meal on a small piece of paper that offers Side dishes, main soups plus extra sides and Desserts.   The waiter explain how to order very nice of him. I order a tonkatsu broth with chasu 13.95$ and whole egg 0.75$ more with extra green scallions. Side dish of fried crispy chicken \"Karaage\".  The waiter put the order in, and I watch the chef start frying the golden chicken. In 6 mins the order comes to the table. It smells wonderful. I'm gonna wait for my Ramen to come first cause the karaage is still hot.  The karaage looked really crispy. It was covered with grated radish and a ponzu sauce (I think). The first bite I took was a big crunch and juice of the chicken thighs pieces. Wow!! It's like eating a juicy chip in my mouth and proper seasoned. Very properly fried to perfection. Good work!! Other places only had little bit of crunch and no seasoning.  After my first bite of karaage i was in another world, then the tonkatsu arrived. The presentation was very nice delightful and eye appetizing. The broth looks really creamy.  It smelled very meaty like pork meat, pork cartilage and chicken-bones been boiling over the hot stove for 6 hours. The smell opened up my appetite like a hot apple pie out of the oven.   Here comes the moment of truth, the taste factor. First thing gotta go for the the creamy broth. Big slurp from bowl to mouth. That creamy broth!! Is wonderfully coats inside my taste buds. I never had such creamy delicious tonkatsu broth in Montreal. It's gotta be that tablespoon of pork fat they put in the broth right before serving makes it so mouth pleasant. The broth coats well the noodle when you eat it the noodle it bounce or dances in the mouth. Very delicious.   In the bowl of Ramen includes egg, onions, black fungus root (I think) and 2 thick slice of chasu with some fat on it.   Let me liberate how they prepare the chasu, they boil the pork belly in the tonkatsu until tender. Then they take it out and cool down for several hours. Cut into thick slices before service. Right before serving they put the meat heaven in a toaster to warm it, after a few mins they take it out and BLOW TORCH they pork belly is until caramelize and bit of charcoal. That's what makes the pork taste so amazing!! You could see how passionate I am about a good bowl of Ramen.  Alright back to the Bowl of Tonkatsu, the second element of heavenly. Is the egg!! The yolk is so perfectly cooked to medium. The yolk is liquidy but firm and it was marinated just enough flavour of the soya sauce.   At the end I had a green tea ice cream and a SAKE ice cream. The green tea taste like any other, but the sake....wow!! It's a homemade sake ice cream it helped a lot to cut down the fatty broth. It's a really good match.  At the end, I was a satisfied customer!! With a full stomach and a warm feeling after the meal. I highly suggest this place! On a rainy snowy day go out and grab a warm bowl of Ramen!!!"}
{"text":"Feels like a piece of Japan tucked in a discrete building off rue Rachel. The service is quick and friendly, and menu is simple: a short list of appetizers, ramen bowls (spicy or not, vege/pork/beef) and a list of extras you can add (seaweed, green onions, egg). Ice cream for dessert. The broth was rich and flavourful, and the meat was fresh. The ramen bowl is filling and very comforting on a cold day. Absolutely without reproach!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good.  Not much to say that hasn't already been said. We like ramen, and eat ramen everywhere we go... (various cities in North America, Asia - including Japan, and even Europe.. yep...). This was comparable to some great ramen we've had in Japan. The tonkotsu soup was super flavorful without being overly rich. Get the bamboo shoots and the spicy miso add on."}
{"text":"Presently the only ramen shop I'd recommend in Montreal.  Not only it is authentic, it is gooood. Even my Japanese friend, a visiting scholar who describes himself as a \"ramen-freak\", approves of Yokato Yokabai.  The menu is straightforward:   - choice of broth (pork or miso)  - meat (chicken or pork) or vegeterian  - toppings (green onion, seaweed, egg)  Extras can be ordered, and saltiness can be tweaked - a nice accomodation for e.g. health conscious clients. Then there's sidedishes. We tried the fried chicken (karaage), the most popular, and found it great. The ramen, however, is on a whole other level. All the secrets are in the broth. Hakata-style ramen is renowned for its pork (tonkotsu)-based soup. It is thick, opaque, rich and delicious. Different jars of condiments are also available: fried garlic, sesame, picked ginger, etc. Speaking of options, I heard that Yokato Yokabai now offers cold (hiyashi) noodles! A great choice during summer to avoid sweating extra buckets.  To cool down, there are also desserts. We had yuzu ice cream, the only item we disliked that evening. It was initially delicious, but yuzu was so potent that my tastebuds were cringing at the end. I'll definitely opt for green tea next time.  Finally, to encourage all fans of ramen to visit this restaurant, I wrote a haiku:  Delicious ramen From Yokato Yokabai Summer in a bowl"}
{"text":"Ambiance agréable quoique très petit. Service plutôt rapide! Je n'hésiterais pas à retourner mais j'irais ailleurs avant."}
{"text":"Was quite impressed with this Japanese restaurant and would probably give it the crown in terms of Ramen in Montreal and there are several. The pork soup ramen is to die for, was flavourful and right amount of spice. I think the broth is actually the best because I usually leave some but in the case drink every once left!!! On the downside I don't think the pork is that flavourful (After trying chicken ramen I think chicken is worst very bland.).                                                                                I also enjoyed the fried chicken which is the best I've had in any Asian restaurant, the secret is the herbs, sesame and soy based  sauce they add once it's done and it's not too greasy. There's also plenty of cocktails, sake and drinks on the menu which was quite nice ;) We were a large group everything went smoothly good dishes to share and wide selection. I will definitely come back maybe every week lol"}
{"text":"If my husband would allow our family to come here once a day, while on vacation in Montreal, we would. The whole family loved it. The meal was pronounced \"the best dinner I've ever had out\" by my 7 year old son. The fried chicken was the only thing that we wouldn't get again, but the broth was fantastic and ordering was easy."}
{"text":"Ils ont beaucoup d'amis ont dirait pour etre si bien coté. Vraiment tres surfait, potable, mais c'est juste ok... Des bancs tres inconfortables, experience japonaise nulle avec des saké au triple du prix, clientele curieuse du plateau, mais qui ne doit jamais revenir... Vraiment bof! Manger une tranche de flanc cru dans sa soupe, si c'est ça l'experience qui vous tente... Vraiment pas la peine avec tous les Isakayas de Montreal."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Montreal. Well priced and delicious. Simple and perfect menu."}
{"text":"Eating there was the cataclysm that prompted me to embark on a quest to find the greatest ramen ever.   To be honest, before eating here, I mostly associated ramen with instant noodle. Man, I was missing out on so much.   OK, let's start off with the broth.  Because it is honestly the best broth I've ever had. It's just so creamy and lovely and perfect. I never knew that creamy broths in ramen were a thing until I came here. Since then, I've been to a few more restaurants that made creamy broths (I was serious about my quest to finding great ramen), and none have been as good as Yokata Yokabai's.  And then there's the pork. So tender that it literally melts in your mouth. Also the homemade ice cream!!! The greatest dilemma is figuring out if you want to get the green tea or yuzu ice cream. After getting through the ramen you're so full and only really have room for one ice cream, and both are just sooooooo good.   The place is really cozy and cute. It can get super busy around peak time. Location is great, service is great, and food is ah-mazing. 100% recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Very decent ramen! Finally a ramen that's not too salty in Montreal (and I've had many...). I would recommend it, the decor is nice, the food really good and the prices very reasonable!  One tiny not on the fried chicken, it was a bit too deep fried for my taste but the taste was good."}
{"text":"Simple menu easy to order. Very rich thick soup and soft meet . It's a little greasy for me. Miso is really spicy."}
{"text":"This was some of THE BEST tonkotsu ramen I have ever had.  Perfect balance of flavors, and the noodles were amazing.  Easy to tell the difference between fresh homemade noodles that they have here versus the 'dry' premade noodles that other places serve.  The only downside to this place is that the temperature in the restaurant was nearly unbearably hot.  Some AC would be nice...the three of us went through three pitchers of water we were so hot."}
{"text":"Le ramen est absolument délicieux. L'atmosphère est très agréable. Très bon service. J'y retournerai sans faute. Fortement conseillé!"}
{"text":"Was craving ramen and followed yelps reviews which led me to this gem. We waited about fifteen minutes to be seated but was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very good broth !!! The fried chicken is the juiciest et the most crispy I've ever eaten. Good quality Good price.. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Restaurant très mignon et typique Japonais ! Le serveur a été sympathique et nous a bien conseiller ce qui était important pour mon amie et moi étant donné que c'était notre première fois à essayer le Ramen. J'ai pris la version épicée au porc, c'était vraiment bon !   Petit Bémol : pas vraiment la place pour déposer nos manteaux qui nous encombraient."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my boyfriend because i've read so many reviews and heard so much about it.   - we waited 45 minutes outside for a table of 2. The restaurant really is tiny, not fitting more than 20-30 people.  - we each got tonkatsu ramens and their specialty fries as well as the chicken karaage. The portions were so small.. my boyfriend and I were shy of taking a piece. We had no more than 10 fries and 4 tiny pieces of chicken..  and i didnt find them that good? It was fine, but not worth all the fuss and the wait.  - as for the soups, it was alright, i would come again if there was no line up, but honestly i thought it was not worth the wait.  - as for service, they are so busy and rushes, they dont have the luxury to provide you with good service, felt a bit rushed to eat and leave to let others in. In the end, we spent more time waiting outside than eating in the restaurant.."}
{"text":"So good!This is probably the best ramen in Montreal !the broth is so tasty,and the fried chicken is crispy..must try the ice cream,they have yuzu sorbet and sake ice cream!!!the service is very friendly..and good atmosphere?"}
{"text":"The tonkatsu noodle was great and the broth very flavourful. Tho I was pretty disappointed with the waiting time once seated (it was about 20 min) and wished they gave more noodle... i am always hungry tho haha!"}
{"text":"Not the biggest menu for ramen but it is a very delicious bowl of soup. Just enough to fill you up. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and quick to serve, and we got our food less than 10 minutes after ordering even thought the restaurant was packed. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"After trying ramen at Kinto, Misoya, Kinka Izakaya and Emadake, I must say this place offers the best ramen. The menu is limited though, they only offer two types of ramen. I ordered a chicken tonkotsu ramen and the green tea ice cream. Loved both of them.  - Chicken tonkotsu ramen: The broth was delicious on its own: flavorful, rich, but not too thick or greasy, with a hint of sweetness. I ordered my ramen with less salt, but I find the level of saltiness perfect for me. The chicken was not dry at all, super juicy and tasty. The noodles were different from the other places I went to, they were thinner (usually at other ramen places they offer thicker noodles that are more chewy). I prefer thick and chewy noodles, but its just a personal preference, the thin noodles were still good. The egg was gooey in the middle, and was not too salty. - Green tea ice cream: Came with two green tea pocky. Tasted great. The ice cream was thick and didn't have a too bitter after taste despite the matcha flavor.  The price is relatively fair. The interior is small but clean, with a cozy ambiance. You can see the chef in action since there is an open kitchen. Great place, gonna come back for sure!"}
{"text":"We waited in line for approximately 25 minutes before we were seated on a Saturday evening. They had no room for us do they offered to seat us in their sister business Ichigo Ichie. We had the option of ordering from either menu. We opted for Yokato Yokabai as we were in the mood for Ramen.  We indicated our selection on paper with our choice of broth, meat/protein, extras, etc. I had the vegetarian broth with tofu. My husband and daughter had the same broth with chicken.  Service was very good-food was brought out promptly and we were not rushed in spite of the place being extremely busy. Both restaurants (they are connected although they have separate entrances) attract a young crowd-mainly because they are located in the Plateau area of Montreal."}
{"text":"I remember loving their ramen the first time I tried it! But as I returned, I realized that it was too thick and heavy to fully enjoy the whole bowl. The pork belly is very tender and delicious but I'm all about the broth. The ramen is served with thin noodles (which makes sense because with thick noodles it would be too much but its what Im looking for).   Unfortunately Yokato Yokabai's ramen is not for me. Their pork on rice is to die for though! Overall, if you like hearty ramens then this is the place for you. If you like a lighter, clearer broth then you might want to try some other ramen restaurants."}
{"text":"I was waiting for a table for 10 minutes, I ordered fried chicken and pork ramen, and just a glass of water, the quantity of ramen it's pretty good, it actually filled me up, the pork was tasty! I added some spices and the ramen flavor was better. It's the best ramen spot in Montreal for sure, the place is not that big but that makes it perfect, I'll definitely come back for some spicy ramen."}
{"text":"Second time here, was looking forward too come back here, it's busy like last time , but hey for a real good Ramen I even que;) I recommend to put Kara Miso on top to it ..... uhhhhh so good and the pork it's Cha-shu ( Pork-Belly) sooo good Not from this planet, had  to order second portion of it. Enjoy if you come here"}
{"text":"Première impression : c'est minuscule! Et on se fait un peu assaillir des l'arrivée par leur bonjour japonais. Mais bon, ça a son charme et ça fait sourire! :) Côté cuisine, on a suivi les conseils des Yelpeurs: on a pris en entrée le karage et le chasu don. Je ne saurai dire lequel était le meilleur des 2!!! Vraiment un régal! Les sauces, les textures...miam!! Et en plat, un tonkotsu porc et un kara miso porc aussi. Je ne saurai dire lequel est le meilleur! Le kara miso n'est pas si épicé que ça, et la soupe est plus épaisse que le tonkotsu. Mais le goût est assez différent. Le porc est fondant, un délice! Et au final c'est vraiment pas loin... On reviendra! Un jour ou il pleut puisqu'il n'y a pas de fenêtres"}
{"text":"Le top des ramen à Montreal se trouvent à cet endroit!  Niveau prix c'est un peu cher mais par rapport à la qualité c'est normal!  N'hésitez pas à y aller vous ne serez pas déçus"}
{"text":"Very good ramen! I always like to head out for ramen whenever I'm in a new city and Yokato Yokabai was some of the best I've tried. Menu is simple and straight forward, good service and at a reasonable place."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs ramen que j'ai goûter à Montréal. Le menu est limité mais la qualité vaut le détour."}
{"text":"Best ramen ever. You would never find this place if it wasn't for yelp. Don't give up, it's really good. You will get it exactly how you like it."}
{"text":"Good food and great place for real food and great service we had great young guys and happy to come"}
{"text":"I've been to so many ramen places and this one in mtl is the best one I've ever had in my life so far, soup is not to salty and it's creamy and not so oily t the same time I always drink all the soup , but only in this place, normally I don't finish the whole soup when I eat ramen cuz it's too salty,  and the noodle is good! It's chewy not too soft not too hard , perfect! The pork is amazing ! And I like how I can add more green onion ! It's perfect! The egg is so good too ! I don't get why ppl have such bad reviews for their ramen, I think it's either they order the wrong one or they prefer super salty ramen!"}
{"text":"Went here on a weekday and got in right away after they opened. This is the best ramen place I've tried in Montreal but not in my top 5 in North America.   Overall it was not bad to be honest, took one star out cause I am a soup person and soup kinda disappointed me. I always have tonkotsu wherever I go, and soup here is really creamy but somehow saltless even I ordered normal--really porky but feel something is missing. I didn't get much soup in bowl either.  Other than that noodle is really fine which I liked it, I ordered extra bamboo shoot and lotus root and came with good amount; my husband ordered extra pork and he got a bowl of ramen full of pork--really soft and fatty chashu! Homemade yuzu ice cream was great, really refreshing after ramen.  I will still go if I am craving for ramen but I won't give up on looking for better ramen spot in town.  --  Update: their chashu don was great!"}
{"text":"Good vibes but food was worse than expected. Very fatty soup. Next time I will try the veggie soup"}
{"text":"We went here with friends and everyone was happy with the experience.  The place feels very authentic and food is great.   The menu lets you pick your choices quickly without confusion and the servers are super helpful.  My choice of meat was chicken but the server told me that the Kara-Miso chicken had pork broth. So she recommended I order the Vegetarian Ramen and add chicken to that. It was one of the best I have ever had!   The place is tiny, so make sure you make reservations if possible!"}
{"text":"This is the real deal!  The only thing I be they need to make this more like Tokyo is the ticket machine out front!  Located on a quiet street that is almost all residential,we kept wondering if we were headed the right way, is a lovely bowl of ramen waiting for you. We entered and were greeted with a question, \" do you only want ramen or do you want drinks?\"  Both I said so they escorted us to next door to Ichiego.  I guess there might be a license issue.  But since we mainly had the ramen I'm putting this review here.   We had both the tonkotsu and the spicy miso. Both were excellent. Very rich and yummy. If you are looking for lighter styles of ramen, probably not your place. But for rich porky goodness, then this is your place. Pork was flavorful, tender and rich.  The egg nicely done. You can customize a bit but I suggest going with normal and standards for your first time to check in comparison to your tastes.   We also got some of the mackerel since we were on the izakya side.  Excellent but maybe a bit pricy.  But having some pickeled mackerel with kiwi and just barely torched turn out to be very tasty.   Reasonable beers and interesting selection of saki. But prices on saki always depress me but what are you going to do about shipping and import issues?    Go now and enjoy!  I plan to go back before the end of my holiday."}
{"text":"Very tasty and decent ramen. I've tried a lot of ramen restaurants in Montreal and this one is the best! I also recommended yuzu ice cream and green tea ice cream, they are soooo good."}
{"text":"The noodle soup is good, authentic. We like it, but not our kids cause the miso soup base is different then what we have."}
{"text":"5 stars for:   1. The takoyaki. It was delicious (but expensive). 2. My cocktail. Creative and tasty (but not very strong either). Unfortunately I don't remember the name, but it was some fruity thing (yes, go ahead and judge me, I don't care).  3. My wife's ramen. She had the spicy miso. I should note that it was pretty boring before she added the condiments to it (3 scoops of the garlic oil).   3 stars for:  My ramen, the tonkatsu broth. It was ok. The noodles were a little too mushy for my taste. The broth was also very bland, even after adding the condiments to it.   Overall a nice restaurant that we enjoyed, but a bit pricey and the ramen, IMO, wasn't that amazing."}
{"text":"Had a great experience there last evening. Restaurant was 80% full, no lineup. The exterior of the restaurant is unassuming. The interior is warm and woodsy with small tables and bar seating - much better ambiance than other ramen places I've been to but might be uncomfortable for some people to sit on stools. The ramen house is connected to a bar/Japanese grub place... They're basically the same restaurant but you can order drinks and other foods if you are sitting on the other side, which is where we were seated. To order the ramen, you check off your preferences from a small piece of paper. The other food is listed on a simple paper menu. My hubby had the vegetarian ramen while I had the spicy pork. Both of us thorough enjoyed it and agreed it was the best ramen we've had so far. Broth was thick, flavorful, not too salty and could be customized with condiments brought to the table - sesame seeds, fried garlic, pickled radish and chili oil. My miso egg was perfectly soft boiled.... Delicious! And the pork was fatty and melt in your mouth tender just the way I like it. The ramen noodles are thinner than I am used to but they were well cooked and had a good bite. I have to admit that our appetizers were just ok. We had the Kara-age (friend chicken) and a fried root veggie (forgot the name). We also had green tea tiramisu and green tea ice cream for dessert which were a perfect ending to an excellent meal."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. Would love to go back again. The meat melts in your mouth. Literally."}
{"text":"My new favourite ramen place! While there isn't much choice, this is the most flavourful ramen broth I have ever tasted in Montreal! All the sides were delicious as well (...yes we tried them all!) Adorable decor! What a great hidden gem."}
{"text":"One of the better Ramen places of Montreal (I would definitely rank this place better than Misoya which is too salty and Hakata Ramen which Im not even sure qualifies as ramen). We went on a Sunday afternoon and the whole restaurant was empty and therefore, service was great!  We both ordered the tonkotsu ramen. The portions are just right, the soup base was slightly on the salty side (but nothing like misoya) but quite heavy, the noodles were nice and chewy. What I really liked about this ramen store is their homemade spicy oil that's on the table. Its very flagrant and has a touch of garlic. If you like spicy food, I definitely suggest that you add some!  However, we all got very thirsty not long after our meal (maybe too much salt in the soup?). Yokato Yokabai is definitely a god choice for ramen when in Montreal but it's far from ramen joints in Toronto (sansotei, santouka)"}
{"text":"Authentic design, simple menu, amazing staff, and incredible food... Hands down, 5 stars for Yokato Yokabai!  Alright, so here is how it's done: (1) Choose your style: Not sure whether you want to get kara-miso (spicy) or tonkotsu (not spicy)? Don't fret, the broth is the exact same in both. Just ask to have the kara-miso with the spicy miso paste on the side. You see, there is always a solution at Yokato Yokabai! (2) Choose your meat: The chicken is thigh meat, which is tender and moist. The pork is from the belly, so it's fatty and delicious. Can't decide? Get both!  (3) Check off your level of saltiness and whether you want green onions and/or seaweed and/or egg.  (4)  GET THE KARAAGE!!!!!!!!!!! ... aka \"not-yo'-mama's-fried-chicken\" ... as an appetizer ... or dessert, for that matter!   For those of you who aren't yet sold... It was a quiet Sunday afternoon, my fiancée and I were out shopping, and I was definitely getting hangry. Our friend had recommended Yokato Yokabai, so we figured there's no better time to check it out.   Right away, the waiter took time to explain everything on the menu. I asked whether to choose chicken or pork, so he suggested I get both... hazzah! For $3 more, I got the best of both worlds. Not that the waiter didn't already impress me, but, while bringing me the ramen I ordered, he noticed the kitchen had given me double chicken instead of half chicken half pork. Without hesitation, he offered to bring the pork on the side. Now, that is smart customer service!  Other notes: -- Gobo is root veg with spicy mayo -- Chasu-Don is rice with pork -- Vegetarian options exist... but I haven't tried them. -- Definitely try the 4 condiments in the small jars at your table. They all go well with the soup. -- There are water pitchers with lemon-flavoured water for you to take yourself!"}
{"text":"My favorite ramen place of all time! Great place for ramen if you like rich and creamy soup. Love their Tonkotsu broth and I always take an extra egg. Both the pork and the teriyaki chicken are good but haven't try the vegetarian one yet. The Kaarage (fried chicken) is also very good. Enough to share for 2 people.  A peaceful place for lunch but can get busy at night and have a line up."}
{"text":"After a positive experience, at yokato yakobai, we decided to got here again.  We noticed that they had expanded considerably in terms of their seating and menu.  The place looks more like an izakaya now.  Serving Japanese tapas and has huge communal tables.  The funny thing after paying and leaving the place, we noticed we were eating at a different place.  It's called ichigo ichie, apparently, yokato yokabai and ichigo ichie are joint businesses.    We had the ramen, chicken karrage and curry potato croquettes.  Everything was all good except for the yuzu ice cream.  The last time we went, the ice cream was memorable.  This time the ice cream tasted like fluffy egg whites.  My cousins said:  \" the ice cream does not even melt!\" :)"}
{"text":"everything you heard is only half true! Small bowl, thin noodles, less options, and the broth is too sweet! To be honest, a little disappointed"}
{"text":"Ramen: salé...bien ordinaire. Avec beaucoup de garnitures même si on choisit des portions régulières. Peu d'épices. Les-à-côtés: très bon. Pas la meilleure en ville...mais dépanne bien.  Over rate..."}
{"text":"This Japanese style ramen is very good, I like the soup in the ramen which is very thick and tasty, and the pork is very tender. Besides, I also ordered the fried chicken, very amazing. The green tea ice Cream is not as good as I expected, I think the ice cream is not homemade, taste like they bought from supermarket."}
{"text":"This ramen place is off on a side road and in a kinda shady looking area/building. However once inside you forget all that as you're greeted by the entire staff and a nice cozy atmosphere. If you're looking for alcohol head right down the hall to the bar connected to it (Ichigo Ichie: you're in for an absolutely wonderful time).   The staff seem fairly attentive no matter how busy it gets, and the ordering system is pretty new to me (you check off what you want on a slip of paper, not exactly unique but I'm more used to ordering off a menu!) the prices seem pretty normal for the ramen. The other items are a bit pricey ($4.50 for a rather small scoop of ice cream!?). The ramen itself is very hearty and not to mention delicious but not very filling, I'm a big eater and the extra noodles for $2 still left me feeling a bit unsatisfied. The noodles were fairly average however the soup, meat, and veggies were amazing. I also got the Karaage to-go for a small midnight snack on the bus back to Toronto. It was tasty but dripping with oil and you don't get a lot for what you pay.  All in all this place, like most other Japanese places, are places you go for the taste and atmosphere over \"bang for your buck\". If you're looking for a cheap fill, I'd suggest heading over and looking at Ichigo Ichie's menu or any run-of-the-mill Chinese place. Unfortunately, the portions seem a tad bit too small considering everything so they'll have to settle for a comfortable 4 stars."}
{"text":"Most likely the best ramen in town. Having been to Japan recently, I came back to Montreal with the hunt for a ramen that comes close to what I tasted in Japan. And this place is likely where it comes closest.  Located in a reclused corner, there are only few seats. The ambiance was nice and you get to see the kitchen, just like in Japan. There are only few choices for your ramen bowl, but don't let that deter you, the taste is really flavorful. The broth is also very thick, which is positive. The only downside though is the high price. But for the quality you get, it is worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Ambiance: Calm and laid back. The setting is peaceful.  Service: Usually fairly fast, discrete and polite. Food: very good quality ramen, the broth is not too salty, as many other ramen places, the egg is perfectly cooked and the meat options, even though they are limited are so far all good. My only complaint is that there is one option for the type of noodles.  I'm definitely going again."}
{"text":"nice soup for the ramen. But the noodle itself was so-so. Prefer miso with a lot of green onions"}
{"text":"This small restaurant serves good ramen for sure, but the way they make it is so different from what I usually like that I can't say that I'd pick them next time I want to eat ramen.   They are pretty faithful to Hakata style, which consists of thin noodles and rich, creamy tonkotsu broth. The noodles are indeed very thin, just for comparison the size was similar to spaghettini maybe? I personally prefer a thicker, chewier noodle. The broth had a great taste, but it was very heavy. At first, I was disappointed because there wasn't a lot of it in the bowl compared to what I'm used to from other ramen shops, but honestly I don't think I could have eaten more since it was so rich. Finally, the pork slices tasted good and were a generous size, but at least half of it must have been fat. Taking bites that were 100% pork fat wasn't great so I didn't even eat all of it.   The service was great and the place looks really nice and authentic. Not great for groups since it's really small, but definitely a place to try if you're a fan of ramen."}
{"text":"I love this ramen place, even though there is often a line up that doesn't move really fast... It's a small place and they don't push you out as soon as you're done, which is probably why you usually have to wait so long. The atmosphere is great, I love the music they play (indie japanese bands or djs most of the time). The broth tastes amazing, they're generous with the toppings. I also recommend the gyoza and the karaage chicken."}
{"text":"My friends and I visited Yokato Yokabai on a chilly winter night the other day. The door is very inconspicuous so be wary to look closely so you don't miss it if you're walking. The decor is and ambiance is very classy and nice. As for the ramen itself (I had the pork tonkotsu with spicy broth), the broth was one of the best I've ever had and the noodles and beef were amazing as well. I'm taking off one star for the saltiness of the entire meal as I was very thirsty after the fact despite ordering normal salted broth. Come for a early dinner if you don't want to wait; as I was leaving there was easily 15 people waiting to be seated around 5PM!"}
{"text":"BEST RAMEN in Montreal. Chashu was perfectly cooked; ramen stock was rich and creamy. Definitely worth giving a 5-star review. I also enjoyed their gobo fries, forgot to take pictures because it was too good. Everything I tried was so satisfying!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, a good Japanese restaurant in Montréal that isn't ridiculously pricey and is good for eating alone as well as in groups? Ladies and gentleman, Yokato Yokabai takes the cake! Located a half mile walking distance from my apartment, it serves up surprisingly authentic Hakata ramen and side dishes to go along with it, in addition to having a multi-tiered shelf full of Japanese goodies that take me back to my childhood. Everything is made fresh in the kitchen, which is open-air so you can see the food being made! Places like this have long been overdue, and it lives up to the hype.  I went in relatively early in the dinner shift, so I was able to just be seated at the bar with no problem. They give you slips of paper that have all of the menu options on them, and you just check off what you want. I ordered the karaage (like Japanese-style chicken nuggets), the kare-miso tonkatsu ramen, and the green tea ice cream. Upon biting into my first piece of crispy, crunchy karaage, I was once again correct in stating that Asians really do know how to fry their chicken. Not only was the outside not soggy at all, but it was super juicy and tender on the inside and had this magical sauce-like stuff on top that gave it that extra dimension. I would have ordered another plate of that straight off the bat if I didn't have more dishes to try haha. Next came the main show - the ramen. Personally, I loved all of the components - including the egg being cooked with a deliciously gooey center, crunchy nori, and fatty pork that just melts in your mouth - except for the noodles. Now, I know that Hakata ramen noodles are thinner than their Hokkaido ramen counterparts, and I hold a personal preference for thicker noodles due to their ability to soak up more of the broth. It was still good nonetheless, and I also found the thick broth to actually have somewhat of a kick unlike what most Montréal Asian restaurants advertise as spicy (aka nothing at all), but I still would have called it in between mild and medium at best. Finally, green tea ice cream is always a hit with me, and this time was no different. They served it up in these wooden boxes and garnished it with green tea Pocky, making it look super pretty and cute! All good things must come to an end, however, so I reluctantly left before I had a chance to buy some of the snacks along the wall.  Yokato Yokabai serves up really tasty, moderately-priced Hakata ramen in a cozy environment. While I don't necessarily think that it was worth paying $14.50 for a bowl (using Nouilles de Lan Zhou as a reference point since they give you so much more for cheaper), I still want to come back and try the other sides. In particular, the chasu-don and fried burdock root look extremely appetizing, so maybe I'll just order a bunch of small plates and have a light meal next time I come here."}
{"text":"Best ramen I have ever had. I use to go to a top rated ramen spot in NY (LES), but this place has ruined me."}
{"text":"I visited Yokato Yokabai again today (January 5) with my friends. I realized the prices have increased on their menu by $1 for the ramen and $0.50 for their Karaage (except for their salad, extra noodle, extra meat, extra seaweed and ice cream). Only the extra 1/2 egg's price has lowered (used to be $1 and now it is $0.75)  I decided to try their Tonkotsu chicken ramen with extra green onions this time. My ramen came pretty quickly despite the restaurant being quite packed! I added the crushed sesame seeds and a lot of their fried garlic (oil), which added a lot of flavor to my ramen. My friend added a bit of their chili oils and she said it was really spicy! I would definitely recommend you to add these free condiments because it makes the ramen even more tasty! I also find that the ramen broth was thicker and richer compared to my last visit to Yokato Yokabai and I like it even more!  The washroom is really clean and pretty! It is worth paying a visit there!"}
{"text":"Ever since coming back from Japan, I've been craving ramen noodle for so long and when I came across this place, I didn't expect it to be as good but oh man it HIT THE SPOT when you add the spicy paste.  They have the vegetarian broth option which is sooo nice since most ramen places in Montreal only have meat broth. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING ramen. By far the best in the city. Get the appetizer that comes in a bowl, it is so eclectic and flavourful you could actually have one or two as the main meal!   BEWARE coming on a friday or saturday night! You will wait for over an hour at peak times for a tiny, back support-less table, so this is a good daytime or weeknight place to take someone. Especially good for tourists or a local trying to impress a date or visitor ;)."}
{"text":"Amazing japanese chicken amazing pork belly ramen is great I had the veggie broth w pork GET THERE EARLY"}
{"text":"Best ramen I had in Montreal. Not a lot of items on the menu but everything is DELICIOUS. If that place was near my house we'd eat there all of the time."}
{"text":"Very nice Japanese ramen, and very tasty treats. I think this winter I will often go, close to my husband's company and my school."}
{"text":"This has to be the absolute best ramen restaurant in all of Montreal! I'm never disappointed! The broth is absolutely amazing and the meat is always so tender and delicious. Everyone needs to try this place!!"}
{"text":"About a 2-2.5: Yokato Yokobai is a small little ramen shop that is located down the hall from Ichigo Ichie.  The menu is pretty small and straight to the point (it's a piece of paper that you just fill out with a golfer pencil), offering tonkotsu-based broths - there is the regular Tonkotsu Pork, Tonkotsu Chicken, Tonkotsu Vegetable, as well as an option to make the tonkotsu a bit spicier (in which they label it as 'Kara-Miso') - there are 3 options for this version as well (the pork, the chicken, and the vegetable).  You have the option to add extra meat and/or noodles, as well as customize the saltiness (less, normal, or more), the amount of green onion (none, normal, or more), addition of nori (none, 1-piece, or 5-pieces), and an egg (non, 1/2 portion, or a whole).  Those who are vegetarians have an option for a vegetable ramen broth.  There are also salads, gobos, karaage, and chashu-don, as well as homemade yuzu, vanilla or green tea ice cream.  The hubs had the regular Tonkotsu Pork with regular saltiness, more helpings of the green onion, 1-piece of nori, and 1/2 of the egg - the broth was super milky and creamy, and maybe a bit too decadent and thick for some.  It had a taste similar to cream of mushroom, so there may have been an addition of heavy cream or milk.  The thin noodles were cooked al dente and I was happy that they did not have a gummy taste to them.  I had the Kara-Miso Pork version, in which there was a little melon-ball scoop of 'hot paste' - however, this wasn't at all spicy, and just made the broth more red.  I had the same customization (the regular saltiness, more helpings of the green onion, 1-piece of nori, and the 1/2 egg) - I thought that this was slightly better than the regular Tonkotsu broth, but again, it still had the super milky/creamy taste.  In addition, we tried the Karaage (fried chicken with some type of a soy-based sauce - the sauce was not good at all, as it was more sweeter and had an overwhelming amount of herbs; I'd much rather prefer a cup of Kewpie mayo), and the Chashu-Don (this had pulled pork mixed in with rice, sesame seeds, radish, ginger slices, green onions, and mayo - the hubs was not a fan, as it was just way too much going on; I thought it was the better-tasting out of all the main items we had ordered.  For dessert, I tried the homemade Yuzu ice cream - this was more of a sorbet, and I really liked it!  It was tangy, sour, and citrus-like, and super refreshing.  This was definitely the highlight of the whole entire meal!  Service was fine, but the host/server was MIA and pretty inefficient.  We had to get our own chopsticks and utensils and refill our own water.  On a side note, there is a rack by the rear entrance with some Japanese snacks.  I'm glad I was able to try this place out, but I won't be back.  +homemade Yuzu sorbetto :D +unorganized queue/hosting situation +MIA servers +overly milky/creamy tonkotsu broth +al dente noodles +pulled pork in chashu-don +underwhelming kaarage +down the hall of Ichigo Ichie"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen! This was our first experience with \"real\" ramen, but the servers were helpful and we had our food in minutes! The Gobo (appetizer) was an interesting and delicious twist on French fries, and the Karaage (fried chicken) was tasty as well! The ramen itself was fantastic. The meats were tender and flavorful and the broth was creamy. Everything went well with a glass of Sapporo. The appetizer and bowl of ramen cost about $20. The service was efficient and the servers were friendly. Overall a great experience - well worth a trip!"}
{"text":"EXTREMELY good ramen. This beats a lot of ramen shops in the east coast. You can alter your ramen the way you like it - less salt, more noodles, etc. The Tonkatsu ramen broth is very tasty. It's creamy but not overpowering and the pork melts in your mouth. The homemade green tea ice cream is also delicious. Their chasu don is VERY GOOD. Nothing on their menu was disappointing for me. Great for a hangover meal. The service was also attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Didn't live up to expectations, but still quite good.  I came for lunch on a cloudy Wednesday, around 1pm. There were plenty of empty seats, no wait at all. My server was friendly and the restaurant had free wi-fi.  The menu is short and simple, you check off the items you want on a slip of paper. There aren't many options for different types of broth, or toppings. I ordered the regular tonkotsu, with corn added. My choice of 1/2 egg, 1 piece of seaweed, onions, and 2 pieces of chasu was included in the base price.  The broth was rich and creamy, it paired well with the texture of the thin noodles. The chasu was tender and cooked perfectly. Downsides were that the egg was subpar, and the portions were a bit small; but I left satisfied.  It's worth checking out, but perhaps not worth waiting an hour in line- as other reviewers have described."}
{"text":"So I traveled to Japan twice and live in San Francisco -a food mecca and I have to say BEST ramen I've had in my life. The staff here are amazing too. We ended up eating here twice during the seven days we were visiting. This place deserves a visit and a 5 star yelp rating."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance, the food is awesome. It was the first time in Montreal that u eat authentic Japanese food. Actually it might be the first time to eat authentic food in a non mother country. Nice Japanese beer, sake is awesome. Ask for the mango/raspberry/sake mix. Speedy service, friendly team above average prices food but totally worth every dollar.  Try the black cod fish, beef tataki, sea weed salad, seared tuna (check my pics)"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try another Japanese place in Montreal after having pretty \"meh\" experiences (Big in Japan, Kyo bar), but I'm so glad I went to Yokato Yokabai on my last day in this fun and beautiful city! The moment I stepped in, I felt like I was at a cozy local ramen store in japan (thanks for playing some Utada Hikaru!). It was the only Japanese restaurant that I visited in Montreal that actually had Japanese cooks. I liked that the menu was simple (miso or tonkotsu ramen, a couple appetizers). I had the pork tonkotsu ramen, and it was delicious--just as good as the ones I've had in Japan! The broth was very thick. The chashu (pork) was a little too fatty for me..but I'm just not a fan of super fatty meat. I also wish they had shoyu (soysauce) ramen, but maybe it's not possible to add to the menu given the small kitchen. I would definitely recommend this place for an authentic ramen experience. Gochi-sou sama!"}
{"text":"Aggressive waiters harassing for more tip even though service was subpar. Good ramen, but inattentive staff that feel the need to be rewarded for work that they did not show for. Water pitchers are placed inconveniently for some tables.   Also, first time I went there was a laminated infographic explaining all the items on the menu. Didn't need it, but for people like foreigners who know nothing about Japanese food, it is extremely useful. On my second visit it was nowhere to be found or offered by the staff, and it took very long just for the aggressive waiter to even look in our direction to have us seated. It was midday on a weekend. Also, use your entire space more efficiently if the izakaya portion is not yet open. During my first visit (also noon on a weekend) we were escorted there and had a great time. Second time was placed in a cramped corner. Just keep making good ramen and be more polite."}
{"text":"I know that there are a lot of mixed reviews on here about the ramen, possibly due to all the hype and maybe heightened expectations?  Personally, for me, it was truly the best ramen that I've ever had.   I went twice during my very short visit to the city. The first time, I finished my bowl completely. I will say that they don't give as much broth as other places that I've been to, but I've also never finished a bowl of ramen anywhere else. I ordered the tonkotsu which was so rich in flavor and also on the thicker side which is a good thing.   An issue I had was that they forgot an item for my bowl the both times that I went. The 1st time, they forgot the corn. I didn't even remember until towards the end because I was so busy enjoying and devouring it. I told the waiter and he took it off the bill for me. The 2nd time, they forgot the addition of lotus. I didn't realize that either until I began eating already; I was even questioning if I had unknowingly ate it. I didn't even tell the server, but after thinking back and looking at pictures of the ramen with lotus, I knew for sure that I didn't have it in my bowl.   Both times I had to wait on a line which extended out the door, an indication of its popularity. The 1st night, the place was packed inside and I could tell that they were busy. The 2nd time around, I didn't have to wait as long as before, but I also didn't think it was full enough inside to have a line out the door. Even while I was leaving, I noticed that there was still a line by the entrance although there were a couple of seats available. I think that had to do with them possibly being understaffed. When I was seated, it took a while before a server came to me and to a few other people who were seated at the same time. Even for water it took a little while. But I could tell that the server was very busy handling a number of other tables so that may have just been a staffing issue.   All in all, I do love the ramen here and I can't wait to come back the next time I visit Montreal. I just hope that they work on the minor issues that I had, but I would definitely recommend this ramen."}
{"text":"They got my order wrong & gave bad service. While the food was good, the layout of the restaurant made it difficult to wait around for a table."}
{"text":"To quote the main character in the Japanese ramen movie, Tanpopo, \"Atsukunai ramen wa ramen ja nai!\" Translation - Ramen that isn't hot isn't ramen at all!  When visiting Montreal from Vancouver, I tried this Ramen-ya.  Although the flavour was good and representative of a Hakata-style tonkotsu ramen, it was served to me luke-warm - a big \"no no\" in the world of ramen restaurants.  Also, as reported by another Yelper, there was not enough soup in the bowl, making it pretty much a waste of time to order a \"kaedama\" (ie. second order of noodles) if you're feeling extra hungry. Minus two stars for this.  The above-noted issues aside, it's probably the best tasting bowl of tonkotsu ramen that Montreal has to offer."}
{"text":"After moving back to Montreal from Vancouver, I had a huge craving for some authentic, rich, Japanese ramen. I usually go for the miso based ramen soup because it's less heavy, but Yokato only serves their tonkatsu broth. It is thick and creamy, and probably the closest thing to Vancouver ramen I've had in Montreal.   My only complaint is that I wish they'd serve more broth with their ramen. They only fill up the broth halfway up to where the ramen noodles are, so because of the broth's thickness, the broth ends up almost like a sauce instead.   I was also happy to see that they had their ginger/roasted garlic/ground sesame seeds available at every table. +1 star just for this."}
{"text":"My 4th time at Yokato and still very good. You might have to wait a little bit before you can get a table, but this restaurant is worth waiting! Exceptional ramen. You can choose the tastes and the quantity depending on your preferences. You have to try the tonkutsu ramen! The porks melt in your mouth. Amazing broth! They also serve appetizers such as karaage, chasu-don and more."}
{"text":"Our first stop in Montreal on a frigid winter night, and ramen was the comfort food of choice. Unfortunately, my choices were limited because most broths were made with pork. \"No pork, on my fork\" ;-)  We started with the Karaage (Fried chicken), Edamame and Vegetable tempura, all were delicious.  The service was great, even on a very busy night. I suggest booking a reservation so the wait isn't long.   Its easy to be a ramen snob when you're from NYC, but Yokato Yokabai satisfied our craving."}
{"text":"The broth is simply amazing and I must say, it's still worth going here to grab some ramen! Yum :D"}
{"text":"If you're looking for ramen, come here. COME HERE NOW!  I had their chicken karaage and tonkotsu porc ramen. Crunchy, juicy, and savoury, the karaage is a must-have. The ramen wasn't the best I've had (Ippudo in NYC holds that title for me), but it's no slouch."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal for the first time. And this was our first stop after 7.5 hours drive from PA. My entourage (5) and I were starving...  I got the tonkotsu pork ($13) and I slurped everything down. The broth was perfect in which it was rich and savory. I checked off all the toppings (green onions, seafood, and 1/2 egg). Topped it off with garlic, chili oil, ginger, toasted sesame (free condiments placed on our table).   So delicious! And I don't even like ramen like that. Well now I officially do ;) Thank you Yokato Yokabai!!  The rest of my entourage all ordered the Kara-Miso Porc ($14), Chasu-Don ($5.50) and homemade Green Tea ice cream ($4). They raved about their dishes as well.   Portion sizes were fair. We just wished there was more as we took our last bites.  Service by Cecile Ngu was excellent. Very friendly and attentive.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Oh how I love great Ramen! This place is as crowded as it can get but they still deliver every time, fast and good. That's what I call effective. The restaurant is separate in two sides and just one of them can serve alcohol. One side booze and one side food. You can order food on the booze side but not booze on the food side.  The sake selection is great and it wouldn't be the same amazing meal without it. You can choose what and how much goes in your ramen bowl, but whatever you choose, it will be so tasty as the base broth is outstanding."}
{"text":"This is a true ramen noodle house. I had the ramen bowl with their famous tonkotsu broth with pork belly & it was delicious! I would suggest for first timers to avoid getting to many sides with their soup, I found that it takes away from the broth. But what was even better & a must try is their fried chicken as an appetizer. The reason I didn't give it a 5 stars is because the service was a bit slow, water was hot and didn't taste good & we were never asked if we wanted anything to drink. Also had their homemade ice cream & I found it was refreshing and cleansed the palate. Over all satisfied."}
{"text":"Tiny, kind of tucked away spot off of Rachel with a simple menu of classic items made right in front of you, incredibly friendly staff who are young but very helpful and professional and excellent at explaining the menu in French and English, and most winningly of all, truly excellent food. The pork rice bowl and chicken karaage were the best I've had of either and I could eat both every day. Delicate and exceptional. The ramen broth and meat were incredibly rich and lovely and all the other toppings were fresh and excellent - loved the pickled radish and sesame seeds in hot oil the most. Feels like a family restaurant. No liquor license so just enjoy a tea or something and relax into this tasty little moment out of time."}
{"text":"Came in around 10pm ish on a Friday night and the place was PACKED. Stating the obvious but of course there was a wait. I got super lucky since I was a one party and was able to be quickly seated at the bar. I still waited roughly 10-15 mins. but noticed that couples or groups of 3+ were definitely waiting 25-40 mins.   The menu is short and sweet. You've got some apps but the rest of the menu is for you to order your own customized ramen. You get to select the type of noods, amount of broth, salt level and choose your toppings. I kept my ramen order pretty basic and I got my meal within no time.   Broth was perfect. I loved that it wasn't too salty and the noods were good too. Staff members were friendly. I liked that I was able to get in and out quickly and head straight home to bed."}
{"text":"I really liked the ambience and the \"hidden-ness\" of this place out of a bunch of residential houses in the Plateau. The broth? Wonderful. Full and rich with flavours. The noodles were alright, maybe the texture could be better and not cooked until it's soft. But then, I guess it's not really fair to compare noodles with those Japanese ramen houses in Hong Kong or China. I really liked their appetizers too, the atmosphere really builds a pretty hip and modern vibe that is both Western and Japanese.  If you find yourself in Plateau craving ramen, I would strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Visiting from vancouver, Japanese wasn't high on my list of cuisines, so I came here somewhat reluctantly. It was amazing! The food And the service were exceptional. If you need a break from poutine, try the fried burdock root."}
{"text":"I really recommend this restaurant in here, bez it is tasty and delicious. As well as, I like Green Tea of Ice cream!"}
{"text":"The ramen were freshly made, soup base are thick and very flavorful.  Best of it all is the cha-siu, they give you 2 big thick pieces.  Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"This is a really awesome spot. Great for a cute date night. Professional staff and nice menu. The spot was full so we went they recommended we wait at the bar  while waiting for our table to be free. The drinks menu is so creative and delicious.  We also ordered little pieces of fried chicken with wasabi dipping. Soo good. Once we got our seat to have our soup We chose what ramen we wanted on a piece of paper. U choose your broth, (3 options) so it really doesn't overwhelm you with decisions, then you choose the protein and the toppings,and the extras. The soup was tasty and a bit creamy. Noodles made fresh. Will for sure be going back there soon."}
{"text":"One of the best Hakata (Fukuoka) style ramen I've had. Let me explain.   This tiny dark restaurant was just what the winter blues buster ordered. I came by here on a Saturday and entered just at noon when it opened to sit at the bar counter and witness the humongous metal pots of ramen broth steaming away. The smell was just amazing! So I ordered a pork tonkotsu bowl. The broth is the perfect meld of rich pork bone with creamy texture. You can order it regular, less salt or more salt. I ordered it regular. One the table are condiments: pickled ginger, chill oil. Fried garlic and sesame seed to jazz it up if you so desire. A delicious experience and I'd concur the best Ramen I've had in Montreal. Possibly up there with the best ramen in Eastern Canada. I'd compare this to quality I've had in Dotonbori, Osaka. It's the real deal folks!   *****warning**** don't come in a big group as its a small restaurant. My suggestion is come as a group of 4 max unless you want to wait. Also come early.   Arigato gozaimasu!"}
{"text":"Inside looks really cool, and I liked the atmosphere. Food, however, wasn't mind-blowing. Just, okay. As a result, overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Better than Kinton, and in my opinion on par with Ichifuku. I visited this place in January but didn't write the review till now.   I believe that food quality is more important for star ratings than service so I will give a positive star rating but I have to mention the service.   The waiter wouldn't take my order assuming I was waiting for a friend although I asked for a table for one. Pretty embarrassing having to try and flag him down while he served couples (took their orders and brought their food out) that had come in after me. I had completed the little order slip and had it sitting on my table while I tried to get his attention, so it's not like I wasn't obviously ready to order.  I was conveniently sitting next to the  cups and pitchers of water meant to be served to customers. This turned about to be a good thing because I had to just grab a cup and serve myself after waiting for quite a while. I should note I came for lunch, right when they opened on a weekday. I got his attention eventually and he seemed a bit annoyed at me."}
{"text":"The best ramen I've ever had in my life ! Wish we had a place like this back home in Miami! Ramen will never be the same again"}
{"text":"So far this is my favorite place for Japanese Ramen in Montreal! It's a really cozy little Japanese Ramen house. I got the tonkotsu ramen with vegetables, while my friends got it with the pork belly. The noodles were on the thin side but they were cooked really well and had a good chew. I really like how they had these little condiments on the side they you can add such as sesame seeds, chilli oil, and fried garlic."}
{"text":"The noodles are really good here, thin and cooked to perfection. Karage chicken was good and so was the tonkatsu soup base with chicken. You're given choice of protein or vegetables and also they have handmade yuzu vanilla or green tea ice cream. 4 stars because they don't have bamboo or corn as an extra side, ramen needs THOSEEEE"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with an authentic feel & limited seating. You'll receive the traditional Ohayo gozaimasu that many businesses greet you with in Japan. The staff is young & friendly however not very attentive. I had to get up a few times to get water from the pitcher myself. Prices are average for a ramen restaurant in Montreal. I went to it's partner location next door & I'll write a review for that one later.  They do not serve alcohol on this side. They do not take reservations in the evenings.  The food was good but not amazing. You place your order on a sheet of paper & check off the options you want. Vegetarian broth is available. I had the kara-miso chicken this time with the whole egg & 1 piece of seaweed & no sides,just straight ramen.   The broth is...how do I describe it? Creamy/Milky? Not spicy considering I opted for the kara miso but maybe Texas has gotten me used to potent habanero peppers! I would not recommend going above with the normal saltiness level unless you're a salt fiend. I might bring it down to the less option if I go back. The chicken was moist though,I'll give them that much.   Overall good but I've had better ramen in different cities."}
{"text":"A bowl of perfection at its finest.  You know it's good when the line is out the door and around the corner on a Wednesday night at 8PM. I walked around hoping the line would die down and at 8:30PM it was still a half hour wait!  Yokato Yokabai has a very simple check off menu of 4 sides, 3 kinds of ramen, and 4 types of ice cream, with specials of ordering 3 items/$1.50 off and 4 items/$3 off. English on one side and French on the other.  I got the tonkotsu (13.95) with kara miso (spicy) (1), pork, a whole egg (0.75), and corn (0.75). This is the only place I have found to have absolutely perfect slices of pork, thick, fatty, and meaty as well. The broth was milky and creamy, with all the fat and collagen emulsified into an amazing soup. The kara miso was a great addition adding color, flavor, and complexity to the broth, but I think the chili oil can suffice in that regards. The garlic oil is great for all those garlic lovers out there, including myself. There was pretty much meat in every bite! The thin noodles were perfect in this kind of heavy ramen and I think with Montreal's weather, does great to warm the belly and soul.  Not the best at seating since there were about 4-6 seats throughout the 30 seat restaurant empty. Even by the time I left at 9:45PM there were still people waiting in line to get seated! Stools have a cubby underneath for your stuff but generally there is no place to hang your coat. Water is self serve on the tables and service is busy between two waiters (my corn was forgotten). Definitely checkout the bathroom art while you're there.  Not sure about the alcohol vs non-alcohol section but based on other Yelpers apparently you have to sit at the bar to be served alcohol."}
{"text":"THE FOOD IS MIND BLOWING; THIS IS A MUST TRY  PROS: * simple ordering (checklist for make your own ramen) == no mistakes! * aesthetically pleasing taste * mind blowing food -- seriously, the pork belly MELTs in your mouth in the best way possible; tonkotsu broth is thick and tasty; I'm not sure what they do with the eggs, but they're phenomenal * portion sizes are generous, and you can add extras for relatively cheap * saw some people ordering the fried chicken + other apps, and they look good  CONS: * although the sizes are generous, bowls are $12 or so; definitely not an everyday eatery * not a huge menu. come here for ramen (or pork katsu), maybe get a snack on the side  * servers aren't tooo friendly, had to grab their attention a few times  OVERALL:  Definitely a delicious place and you won't be disappointed. Come for the food, not the service or a \"steal\" of a meal"}
{"text":"A bustling izakya with lots of charm. High price point for the offerings but delicious ramen broth, chicken karage and fried octopus balls. The matcha ice cream is standard and served with Pocky. Cocktails and beer price s were steep but appetizers were reasonable."}
{"text":"I've tried too many ramen and one is just average. Nothing extra ordinary. The broth was too thick and oily for my taste and the flavor is lacking. Although the pork is tender and juicy. The place is too small as compared to the number of customer hence, the long line."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try out Yakato Yakabai because of their featured vegetarian ramen. I loved the seating and the service was prompt and friendly. The wooden benches, warm lighting and fun music made it feel as though I had entered a ramen bar in Tokyo (or what I would imagine it to be anyways!).   My 3-star rating is for the underwhelming food. I was disappointed by the bland broth and meagre toppings. I tried a side of fried gobo which was oily and too salty.   I wouldn't recommend for vegetarians! I really wanted to give more stars but couldn't justify it after the poor food."}
{"text":"Disappointing ramen. The broth was very thick. Not a lot of extras. The chicken was ok. The pork belly was fantastic."}
{"text":"Best meal we had in Montreal.   The ambience is typical of a Japanese restaurant.  It is a small space filled with lots of hungry people.  There are lanterns hanging and traditional Japanese images painted in the halls and near the bathrooms.   We waited in line for about 45 minutes before being seated which was to be expected on a Saturday night.  We ordered burdock fries and fried chicken for starters and both were delicious.  The fried chicken was battered and fried and topped with seaweed, spices and sauces.  As for the ramen-oh my god-it was incredible.  If someone were to ask me what the best meal was that I enjoyed in a restaurant, I wouldn't pause for a second before excitedly telling them about this drool-worthy, slap-ya-mama good meal.  Holy cow!!! The noodles were buttery and creamy.  The broth was full of flavor and all of the veggies and meats were cooked to perfection.  If I were in Montreal longer, I'd be back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Pretty much a ramen expert and have eaten ramen all over the place and this place is a good as it gets if you don't mind a pork stock instead of miso. It's a little pricier then your standard ramen joint as it's a full on funky spot and you can also order your ramen just like you want - salty.. sea wood..1/2 egg full egg or seaweed. One bowl is plenty for lunch for dinner I would order a side."}
{"text":"Etant à la recherche d'un bon restaurant japonais traditionnel, j'ai décidé de tester Yokato Yokabai un midi. Situé à deux pas de la rue Saint-Denis sur le plateau, le restaurant est assez petit, ce qui rend le cadre joli et intimiste.   Pour ma part j'ai testé : - Le Karaage en entrée (poulet frit) : Très bon ! La viande est tendre et la panure est croquante. Il faut aimer le jus de citron par contre, car le poulet est assaisonné avec. - Les ramen avec le bouillon de légumes, un extra kara-miso et du poulet : la viande est bouillie et donc très tendre, les pâtes sont fines (un peu trop à mon goût) et le bouillon est agréablement relevé (grâce à l'extra kara-miso). Un bon plat de ramen, mais rien d'exceptionnel non plus. - La glace au thé vert en dessert : très douce et très crémeuse (il ne s'agit pas d'un sorbet mais bien d'une glace). Idéale pour atténuer le goût du piment de l'extra kara-miso.  Bref, une adresse sympathique pour manger des ramen à Montréal. Mais ce n'est pas encore la perle rare que je recherche !"}
{"text":"Great tonkotsu ramen noodle which I didn't expect even in my hometown, Washington, DC and was happily surprised :-) Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy Sunday right at opening for dinner time. (5pm). No wait for a table, but the place immediately filled up. Definitely recommend getting here at opening to avoid the wait.  I had the tonkotsu ramen with pork belly. The broth was flavourful, and the pork was cooked well. The portion size is good. I felt like the broth was a little one dimensional, and could have used some more seasoning and / or spice. Next time I'll try the spicy one.  Biggest surprise was the homemade ice cream. The green tea was decent, but the sake flavoured ice cream was delicious. Just the right amount of creaminess, with a surprising kick of sake."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere -- great to come as a group or date night. Ramen noodles are made on site and the ramen soup is good. Loved the chicken karaaga especially. Sophisticated drink menu. Recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"Like all the other Japanese ramen, the broth was very thick. I chose the less salt but still got very thirsty after the meal. Since I was already very full with noodle and broth and appetizer, I couldn't quench my thirst with more water.  Overall it is worth trying, the pork and egg is very special to my taste. The thick broth is not my favorite.  There are four appetizers to choose from and we had three of them. The fried veggi roots is new to me. Very tender even after deep fried. The fried chicken and don(rice) are very good too.  Price wise : a little expensive comparing to other place in downtown area, considering the dinning condition which is not very spacious."}
{"text":"This place has the best ramen I've ever tasted.  I ordered the tonkatsu pork ramen with some dishes from the kitchen.  We had the cold smoked duck, smoked salmon over rice, and pork belly skewers.  All amazing.  The duck was tender, the rice with salmon had a delicious sauce on it, and the pork belly was a little crispy but very flavorful.  But the ramen is the real hero here.  The broth was creamy and flavorful.  The egg was cooked perfectly:  still a little bit of runny yolk in the middle.  The pork had a little bit of fat still on it which gave it a nice chewy texture.  The green tea ice cream with a side of azuki bean mochi was probably one of the cutest and most delicious desserts I had during my stay in Montreal.  Overall, this is a great izakaya-style ramen house, and I plan to return again and again on my trips to Montreal."}
{"text":"The pork tonkotsu was great. It started out a little bit bland, but I added some of the at-the-table condiments and by the end of the bowl, I was scooping up every last bit of broth. The pork was incredibly tender and the eggs were delicious (so you should go ahead and add the extra half).  I was a little bit wary about the bench-style seating at first, but it didn't turn out to be an issue, and it was interesting to watch the cooking staff work.  The servers and cooks were all very happy and efficient, despite it being quite busy. And their in-unison goodbye to each guest is a nice touch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to do when traveling is to find the city's best ramen place. This place had some great reviews, so we gave it a go.  The seating in the ramen area was a bit uncomfortable, so you should expect to sit at a bar or near strangers. The ordering system consists of using a piece of paper and selecting what kind of ramen you want, as well as what (and how much) you want in it. The paper is in French and English, and is designed for one per person. If you try to put more than one order on one paper, the cooks will get confused (I overheard them complaining about this).  I had the tonkatsu pork with normal saltiness and green onion, and half of an egg. The broth was much thicker than what I've had in other ramen places, which was strange but good. The noodles were really good, but overall I found the flavor to be a bit dull, like it needed more salt. There were the usual ramen \"condiments\" on the counter, such as garlic and what I think was sesame (it smelled like peanuts), but nothing spicy - turns out someone took it away to another table. So make sure you look around if you can't find it.   The bathroom is located down a series of stairs which feels almost like a maze, and has some interesting artwork painted on the walls - it was traditional Japanese-style paintings of people in sexual positions with their privates pixelated. I thought it was funny and so random.  It wasn't bad, and the service was good, but I have a hard time recommending it as a great ramen place."}
{"text":"If you don't want to wait for Ichigo Ichie next door, try Yokato - same food, shorter queue, quicker service. It only serves ramen, no booze, but MATE, THAT'S ALL YOU NEED BECAUSE THIS STUFF IS INCREDIBLE.  Highly recommended: pork tonkotsu, extra egg, followed by green tea ice cream"}
{"text":"This if officially Montreal's best ramen joint. Menu is simple and just mouth watering. If I could change one thing, it would be to have more tables in that place. Do make sure to avoid rush hours, as you will find yourself lining up at the door. But I promise you, it's worth the wait. Once you hand over your little piece of paper to the waiter, a bowl of ramen will arrive at your table on a timely manner. Pork portion is just so satisfyingly thick with barely any fat on it and the rest is history. Kidding! What I liked the most was the option to choose the level of saltiness in your broth, which is a detail for many but a huge plus for me. I find that salt will mask the purity of the real flavors. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best pork belly I've had and the ramen broth was everything. Very savory and filling. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Line ups are always long, but hands down the best ramen in the Montréal area! Definitely worth the wait and ordering is always very quick- great service!"}
{"text":"Cute little ramen shop! The place was small so I could easily see this place being packed during lunch or dinner prime time. After sitting down, we were each given a paper to select the type of ramen and toppings that we wanted. My boyfriend ordered the tonkotsu while I had the kara-miso ramen. We also ordered the karage for appetizer.  The karage was very good! It was crispy, not too overly dry on the outside, and juicy in the inside. Squirt some lemon over it and it was perfect. I also thought both broths of the ramen were good with it being rich and creamy. There was enough meat in my bowl which was tender. I ordered the normal size and thought it was a good amount for myself.   To finish the meal, we shared a yuzu ice cream. SO good! Overall, I had a good time here and would come back if I have the chance to visit Montreal again. Very wonderful service too."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a full 5 stars had they not forgot to bring our appetizer. However, they did not end up charging us for it. This is very authentic ramen, made to order. Perfect! (and worth the wait)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. By far the best ramen in Montreal. Excellent Hakata style ramen. The broth was great!  Wish I can get more of the broth!  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call myself a Ramen connoisseur by any means but I know good food when i get it. The ramen is so rich and flavourful and the noodles and pork were perfect. Full disclosure I was hungover and it definitely solved that pounding headache immediately. Five thumbs up for Yakota Yakobai."}
{"text":"3.5 stars from me! My mom, two year old daughter, and I trekked from downtown out to this quaint little ramen shop. It serves two variations of tonkotsu ramen -regular and slightly spicy. For each you can choose less salty/regular/more salty, less green onions/regular/more, etc for a few ingredients. We went with less salty for both and the taste was just fine, didn't feel lacking. We also had karaage (Japanese fried chicken) and it was so flavorful. The salad was tasty but beware the dressing is made with wasabi and caught both me and the kiddo off guard and caused a panicky reach for water.   My two year old loved the food but a lot of the chairs are high tops at a counter type set up, so if you have a wiggle worm or a kid who hates booster seats (like mine), your experience might be less than peaceful as you try to make sure they don't fall while you slurp down your noodles.   There is free wifi (just ask for password) and that is especially useful for foreigners needing to call an Uber for a lift home when you're so full."}
{"text":"J'ai une obsession pour les ramen, j'ai fait le tour des bonnes place de ramen a Montreal mais ca c'est un autre niveau. La saveur unique de leurs bouillon, la qualite de leurs aliments et le porc tres savoureux ajouter a des nouilles fait maison. Ca donne une formule gagnante."}
{"text":"We wrapped up our new year trip in Montreal with, of course, ramen for lunch. First we went to Ramen-Ya, and found out that it was still closed for the new year, so we looked for another Japanese place nearby, and we found this gem, Yokato Yokabai!  Firstly, you'd be asked if you wanted to consume alcohol. If so, you'd be seated in the bar section. The lunch menu was very simple with a handful of appetizers and two types of ramen, Tonkatsu and Kira-miso which you can choose to go with either chicken or pork. You can order from a piece of menu on the table and customize your ramen. We decided to get with the normal ramen which has regular saltiness. The broth was amazing.   We also ordered gobo to go along with their fruit beer, Ichiko Ale. I personally never had gobo root before, so it was very interesting.  Don't forget to check out the artworks along the way to the bathroom downstairs!  I would recommend this place to anyone who's in search of good ramen in Montreal."}
{"text":"C'est devenu pour moi le meilleur Ramen de Montréal. Plus authentique que les autres peut-être. Les toppings étant un sacré plus (beni sh?ga, huile à l'ail, échalote, sésame). Leurs oeufs sont vraiment bien cuits.  J'y suis allé au moins 3 fois et là qualité est toujours sans faute.  Faut que j'y retourne !"}
{"text":"Great ramen! So much flavour and the atmosphere is warm and cosy. You should show up about a half hour before you originally planned because there's normally a line but they take your name down and the wait is about 30 mins. I don't think they take reservations."}
{"text":"Les meilleurs ramen que j'ai pu goûter (pas encore eu l'occasion d'aller au Japon haha). C'est absolument divins et l'ambiance du restaurant est aussi super agréable : on n'a plus l'impression d'être à Montréal. En plus, l'accueil est très sympathique et voir la cuisine ouverte rajoute à l'atmosphère. Le choix des ramen est réduit et c'est tant mieux, pas besoin de se prendre la tête à passer sa commande.  En bonus : la glace maison au thé matcha, un délice !"}
{"text":"This is the only ramen in Montreal that is actually good! Go there and avoid the other ones."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Yakato Yakabai. The food and the experience both represent very faithfully what you'd get in Japan.  I had the ramen with all the fixin's, and of course the fried chicken. I still prefer Kinka's fried chicken, but this one was quite good.  We went at lunch time on a week day so it wasn't that busy, but I can easily see this place getting packed.  To conclude, very enjoyable, on part with other Izakaya's downtown in my book."}
{"text":"The broth was too rich for my liking, although the ramen was flavourful. Service was good, great ambiance, nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Service was awesome :)) The server was super friendly and funny. Him and the ramen made our day.   All the staff say arigato gozaimasu after you leave, Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Même si certaines salles restent un peu bruyante, on peut quand même s'entendre...  tres bonne préparation et prix modéré. Service tres sympa."}
{"text":"Un mot pour décrire ce restaurant: excellent. Situé au coin des rues Drôlet  et Rachel, on peut facilement  passer à côté  de cette petite merveille. Le personnel est très accueillant. Dès notre entrée,  tout le personnel vous salue en japonais. Une ambiance chaleureuse, cette place est idéale  pour un rendez vous amoureux . Le menu est minimaliste toutefois de qualité. Ramen fait à la perfection. Un mélange de saveur qui vient exciter les papilles gustatives. J'ai aussi goûté à la salade verte. Simple et attention épicé ( dû  au grains de wazabi). Si vous avez assez d'appétit, goûtez au chasu don. Mets fait avec du poulet, riz, oeuf mou et autres ingrédients. Vraiment délicieux. Alors! Fan de ramen, ce restaurant est à essayer absolument."}
{"text":"Petit frère de Imadake, ce Yokato Yokabai est parfait pour un délicieux ramen réconfortant pour un souper léger. Donc, on y sert principalement des ramens style Hakata 12$ (??????). Pour avoir déjà vécu à Fukuoka/Hakata au Japon, les ramens goûtent pareils, leur chef est d'ailleurs de Fukuoka. Leur menu est simple et très limité, juste des ramens et trois à-côtés. On peut faire rajouter à notre ramen, oeuf, algue, oignon vert,...Leur petite salade à 3$ était ordinaire par contre leur poulet karaage à 4$ était croustillant et bon. L'endroit est nouveau depuis 2 semaines, l'entrée est situé sur une rue résidentielle, la rue Drolet au coin de la rue Rachel. On était les seuls clients, pas trop achalandé pour un vendredi soir. La déco à la japonaise est minimaliste. Service sans plus du serveur. Ils n'ont pas encore leur permis d'alcool.   4/5 visité en avril 2015."}
{"text":"I have tried at least 5 ramen restaurants in Montreal. This one takes the cake. Super simple menu. It tastes homemade. The broth is rich of flavour and the pork melts in your mouth. I now appreciate it when it rains in Montreal, it always a good reason to eat ramen. The waiting line outside is worth it."}
{"text":"Probably the most charming ramen restaurant in Montreal. Ok, make that definitely. They really know how to pick a great locale and it's great to see businesses revitalize what was once considered a \"derelict\" building.   Now the ramen. I won't lie, I've had better ramens; not to the point where I'd consider myself an expert (read: snob), but enough to be able to tell whether a decent amount of effort has gone into the broth. While I enjoyed my ramen, allow me to make a few constructive feedback: the slice of pork was a tad too thick and fatty (though tasty!), the egg should be served warmer and could use a bit more marinating, while the broth was a bit 'flat'.   I did really like the karaage chicken; I have nothing but good things to say on this one.  The service was prompt and friendly, the price reasonable for the neighbourhood and for Japanese fare in general. And finally, I really appreciate how beautiful and clean the toilets are. Because if the toilets are clean then the kitchen is likely to be clean as well. Always a plus."}
{"text":"It is difficult to find this place at first because it has two entrances and the indication at the door is confusing. There's always a lineup and we waited for 1 hour when we arrived there at 6PM. Reputed to be the best ramen place in Montreal, Yokato is one of the busiest Japanese restaurants I have ever seen in the city. The inside of the place is quite dim but has good vibes and their bar is less busy than the eatery. Their sake is nice and four of us shared a bottle.  Their ramen, my god, is indeed worth the one hour wait. The soup is savoury and cooked for hours with pork bones. It's creamy and rich but not excessive. The handmade ramen noodles is chewy and heavenly. Pick reduced salt soup and the taste is just extremely well balanced, otherwise the regular salt level is a bit salty to my taste.  An extra surprise was the homemade yuzu (Japeness citrus) sorbet, WOW WOW and WOW! Refreshing and balanced to perfection it is a Must try! I would go back just for the ice cream"}
{"text":"This place doesn't take reservations so when I went there was 4 of us. The wait for us was a little over 1 hour which was well worth the wait because this is the best ramen I've ever had in my life (I haven't been to Japan yet). Maybe it was so good because I was starving but I don't think that was the reason. When the ramen came out it was piping hot and that's how I like it.   I'm from California and we have a lot of good ramen places so I feel I have a good idea of what good ramen is. This place was amazing and the flavor was perfection. All four of us agreed this was one of the best ramen places in North America and 2 of us had been to Japan. We were all completely satisfied."}
{"text":"To be honest, I've tried ramen at 4 different Japanese restaurant in Montreal and the ramen here is the best!!! The taste was really really good! I'm definitely gonna go back again~"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place to eat tasty ramen and I found this place located 15 minutes away from where I live. It's big and they have several dining rooms and it is busy with other ramen lovers like myself. I've read previous reviews of this place and was excited to try it, and I was not disappointed. The ramen broth is amazing, it's full of meaty, almost like mushroom-y flavor, definitely one of few best broth I've tried in Montreal. The pork had a little bit too much fat, but a nice softly boiled egg was just the way I like it. The decor of the place is pretty cool and it's perfect for any clients: family with kids, couples, friends. This place is a must stop for all the ramen lovers out there."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen we had. And we eat a lot of Japanese ramen in NY, Florida, Cali or in Canada. The tonkotsu soup base is thick and savory. Choose your own saltiness level, meat choices, scallion or none. All of our ramens came out different, but all of us gave it a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Montreal, no jokes. I had the tonkatsu ramen, with chicken karaage for starters, and green tea ice cream for desert. I would usually have a pint of Sapporo with a bowl of ramen, but they do not sell alcohol (if you go to Ichie Ichigo though, they do sell alcohol, and I believe it is the same ramen, as the two restaurants are connected).  Chicken karaage was good, but I prefer when the pieces are a bit smaller, it is just easier to eat. I also think  the chicken karaage wasn`t crunchy enough. Ramen was simply excellent. Broth is amazing, it was not too heavy/greasy,and gave a comforting feeling, don`t really know how to describe it. The pieces of pork were just so good, fatty, tender, perfect seasoning.  Then I had the green tea ice cream. Bruh, that **** was heaven in a cup. I think they do it themselves."}
{"text":"Best Ramen I have ever had. Quaint atmosphere and friendly service. Glad we stumbled in."}
{"text":"Tasty ramen. Because of all the hype I decided to go there to try. Maybe my expectations were too high so I only found it ok. But for a conforming ramen on a cold day it does the job"}
{"text":"Don't let the line up deter you from going here.  Was in line for maybe 30 minutes on a long weekend and it was well worth the wait. Had the tonkotsu ramen with pork belly.  The broth is rich and creamy but not too heavy.  The pork belly was cooked to absolute perfection.  I love that they have roasted garlic, peanuts, spicy oil and picked ginger at the table for you to add your desired amount.  You can customize your ramen from the start to finish and I absolutely love that.  The gobo (burdock fries) was a great starter, nice and crunchy with a spicy mayo.  The mayo isn't that spicy but it had good flavor.  The karaage (fried chicken) appetizer was good but nothing extraordinary.   Ended with their homemade ice cream.  We were a group of people so we tried all the flavors.  The green tea is by far the best one, followed by the yuzu, sake and then vanilla.     Great pricing too! appetizer, ramen with extras and ice cream for $24 before tip.  Reasonable dinner price for the amount of food you get.  Staff was super efficient, friendly and professional.   I know I will be craving and dreaming of their ramen and it's the only thing that'll get me through the cold winter months to come in Montreal. I will be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"a very popular ramen place in Monreal and I habe been lined up ome time. Its small but cozy"}
{"text":"As a huge ramen fan I had to find a local ramen while in Montreal. This place did not disappoint. Get here a little early as there's usually a line and they don't take reservations. But once in it's so worth it! We had the Japanese fried chicken and was delicious and juicy topped with soy vinegar mix that went perfect with it. The pork ramen was perfect, from the broth to all the toppings."}
{"text":"My best Ramen place - poor selection of Sakés but super good food"}
{"text":"Aperently the best ramen in mtl according to people?! I would call it descent and give a 3/5  They only have one sort of meat pork broth,they used to have the chicken one but now it's gone. I took the least salty choice of  tonkotsu and it was okay while eating it,but omg i was so thirsty after leaving the restaurant....so there must have been lots of salt and msg!!!   The noodles were okay,nothing perticularly special. The soup was flavourful and fatty. Also took the gobo fries which was interesting,but a little bit overfried. the karage was not most,nor jucy,just a froed chicken and i have tasted better.  The service was attentive,the waiting staff girls seems to be working super hard.It's also a good thing u just leave your name and they call u back when your table is ready.The service was a little bit confusing, i ordered extra noodles and karage,it only came at the end when i was almost done with my ramen.It is understandable though,busy saturday so i didn't go crazy about it.  Bottom line,the place looks great and has a nice ambiance. the food is okay, i would say better than the ramens on st-cath. I would recommend this ramen place over the other ones. The izakaya ichigo ichie right next to it is cool too."}
{"text":"The noodles and broth were delicious. Pork was tender and well marinated. Definitly the best Ramen shop in Montreal. However $ is on the high end considering the portion."}
{"text":"Excellent service in an enchanting and rustic setting. Food was exceptional and arrived with punctuality.  Definitely a great place to get a quality meal alone or with friends on a cold night.  I have enjoyed ramen in the past and happy to conclude that this ramen is authentic and delicious.  Staff is friendly and very accomodating."}
{"text":"Worth da wait! Great ramen!! My wife is Japanese and we have eaten ramen all over Japan and the world. Their broth is rich, layered and tasty. Great straight noodles and tender slices of pork. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Good price, authentic quality and delicious! I recommend the spicy miso with the pork belly and a side of Karaage!"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant tout près de la rue Saint-Denis est trop mignon et l'agencement te fait sentir comme au Japon. J'y suis allée une fois avec une amie, c'était notre première fois qu'on goutait à des ramens alors on a écouté les avis des Yelpeurs. On n'a vraiment pas été déçu, j'avais choisi le ramen au poulet et mon amie celui au porc. Le serveur nous a vraiment bien conseillé et était très gentil avec nous.   Je suis retournée une nouvelle fois avec mon copain mais cette fois-ci le bouillon était un peu plus épais et salé, c'était dommage, il n'a pas tellement apprécié.  Les prix sont assez abordable (15$ environ par personne). Le restaurant ferme normalement à 22h mais ils ont acceptés qu'on rentre à 21h45, j'ai trouvé ça très sympa."}
{"text":"Loved it! The vibe of the place was just very nice. The ramen especially was probably the highlight of our evening when me and my SO when there."}
{"text":"I chose the tonkatsu broth and it was thick and rich from the oils of the meat, but surprisingly a bit bland. Although you can definitely taste the meaty broth, I could barely taste any salt so I had to add in my own. On the good side, the noodles were chewy, and the chicken topping was tender and well spiced. We also got the fried chicken, and gobo fries as a side, and although they were good, the portions were small and were not very note-worthy nor was it worth the price. I might sound highly critical--but in all honestly, the ramen was good/ok, but just a bit of a let down from all the rad reviews."}
{"text":"Came to this place 6 days ago. Just came back from Japan last month and have been missing the amazing ramen from there. This place was good. Wish there was the traditional red chilli paste in it and that the yolks were runny. The service was great, very friendly!  I give it a 3.5"}
{"text":"Now I'm no uber ramen aficionado but I have been to quite a few and have tried enough ramen bowls to determine the good from the \"meh\" and I'll start by saying that this place is a definite YESSSSS.  The decor of this restaurant is awesome and gives off a very \"homey\" feel with the decor and the art.  The menu itself is very simple and has you just selecting what you want and passing it off to the waiter.   I opted for the Tonkotsu broth with extra pork belly and green onions and oh my was it delicious.  They have an assortment of condiments you can add (fried garlic, hot oil, pickled ginger and ground sesame) and all of it really helps enhance the already tasty flavor.    The broth itself was very rich and I could tell that they were simmering that pork broth for a LONG time by the flavor.  The place was bustling and even though we got there RIGHT at the openning (noon in this case on a Saturday), the interior was already packed (though there were seats in the back room).    Overall if you're in the area and are a lover of ramen definitely give this place a go!"}
{"text":"Honestly disappointing. I waited in a line for god knows how long to be served a starchy broth with stale chicken. Yet the atmosphere was buzzing, and their noodles were impressive. I just feel like a disappointed parent."}
{"text":"?????Montréal ?????? ?????????????? ??????????? ????????? ????????"}
{"text":"Great ramen, friendly staff. We've had ramen all over Japan, and this stacks up with the best! A simple menu, but everything was flavorful, service was fast and friendly...."}
{"text":"I must not be a big fan of Japanese food as I didnt particularly like any of the plates I ordered. The salmon tartar was the best of all but the portion was tiny. The karaage chicken was ok but lots of fat pieces. Finally, the udon noodles were very basic, just lots of garlic and some mushrooms. Pretty expensive for a plate of noodles...."}
{"text":"Honestly the best chicken ramen I have ever had in my life. Why just 4 stars then? I tried the pork ramen once, and I found it tasted so off... I normally love pork dishes but this one had such a strange taste that I couldn't put my finger on. Will never order that dish again, but I keep coming back for the chicken ! Make sure you come early tho cause you will wait in line for at least half an hour otherwise."}
{"text":"Ramen was incredible - the night was special as it was the first place i went with my boyfriend!! Dont go to the restaurant right next place it had very bad service"}
{"text":"Got the pork ramen and it was delicious. Not too thick broth with perfectly tender chasu. The restaurant is set up kinda weirdly but the food is stellar"}
{"text":"I'd like to start this review by saying that I've had ramen a few times, but not THAT many times. I was never a huge fan of ramen.   So, my date suggests this place, because he says that the food is pretty amazing. We got there at 4:55pm and it was already almost full! (The place was supposed to open at 5pm!!!) We were asked if we wanted a table and we did, so we were redirected to the back of the restaurant which was... another restaurant? Basically, it's two different restaurants that are owned by the same people and they're kind of together. Anyways! We're given the menus of both restaurants and we order our ramen.   The first thing I noticed was that the place was rather small, but not too tight. It was very intimate. The second thing I noticed was the decor. It's so beautiful! It has a very rustic feel and I just loved it!  The food came rather quickly and the bowls were actually a pretty good size! I was very full at the end and my date was full. We were given a big wooden spoon type thing and a pair of chopsticks. It was a pretty cool way to eat. I've never used the big spoon before!  Oh, but the best part was the flavour. Wow. Just, WOW! The broth was thick and flavourful, the ramen had a great texture, the presentation was nice, the pork was AMAZING! It actually melts in your mouth. Wow. Perfection. Just INCREDIBLE! I've never had ramen that was packed with so much flavour! And the waiter brought by 4 types of condiments including a spicy chili oil. Now, im very picky when it comes to chili oil, since i find that restaurants use bland oils. But this one was SPECTACULAR!! I used so much of it and it was actually, properly spicy! Not that fake spicy that you can't even taste!   So just an amazing meal! And it was really cheap too! 13$ before Tax and tip. Since then, I've been craving ramen!! All I want to do is go back there, so if you're looking for a good place to eat, look no further!"}
{"text":"J'y étais pour le lunch et pour assouvir une envie de ramen. Le Resto est intéressant: décor et ambiance. Le service très sympathique. J'ai pris une ramen au porc avec bouillon de porc. Correct. Sans plus. Bouillon très gras et salé: je sais que c'était une ramen mais quand même on pourrait être dans un peu plus de subtilité. J'ai du boire 2 litre d'eau en mangeant pour m'hydrater....les nouilles de la soupe étaient bonnes. Disons que je ne ferait pas de détour pour y retourner et que probablement que j'irais dans un autres Resto."}
{"text":"You'll probably have to wait in line for a little, but it's gonna be worth it. The ramen and its broth are a-ma-zing. It's quite small but it only makes it more intimate and picturesque. If you like indie Japanese music, you'll be even more satisfied with this foody experience. Plus, it's quite cheap for the quality of it ! Itadakimasuuuu !"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places in Montreal for sure. It is unpretentious and focuses on doing a few things very well."}
{"text":"TLDR: one of the best ramen joints in the world (we would know).  We live in Toronto and are lucky to have some of the best ramen in the world (Santouka, Sansotei, etc). In addition, we've visited Japan several times eating at the top ramen restaurants in the world. We can say with confidence that Yokato Yokabai is among the best. We ordered the tonkatsu with pork belly, regular salt, thin noodles. This is classic ramen at its best. You can tell from the intense depth of flavour that no corners have been cut in what is sure to be an insanely laboriously process. The pork belly is the one departure from tradition - and it works! Instead of the usual Cha Siu salty preparation, they opt for a more modernized caramelization. The result is a pork belly that melts in your mouth with a slight hint of sweetness. The broth is creamy but not heavy.   FYI wait is long both for a seat and for your meal. Don't come in a rush.   Highly recommend 10/10"}
{"text":"Absolutely adored the place. Friendly service. Great ramen and food! It reminded me of Japan!"}
{"text":"Just great, be sure to try all the different seating areas to get a feel for it, I suggest going with at least 4 people and let the wait staff guide you. Sharing is the best way to discover the menu. Plan on taking your time, this is not fast food and line up can be an issue."}
{"text":"I'm very torn with this rating. I actually was eating at Ichiego next door and ordered the ramen, as Ichiego also offers customized ramen from next door at their restaurant. I thought the was a fun, clever arrangement.  However, way after my friends had received and devoured their dishes from Ichiego, no one at Ichiego were able to give me a straight answer about where my ramen was. I was told 3 times it was on its way before it arrived at the table, way after my friends' food and plates had been cleared.   This was a major let down. They offered 50% off before I had to ask for it, but I think they should have taken it fully off the bill given the inconvenience. (My friends and I were also consequently late to our next plan because my meal was missing.)  In terms of taste, it was very good. My tonkotsu ramen with chicken had maybe too many noodles per broth, but each ingredient was delicious, including the milky broth. It was the thickest tonkotsu broth I've ever had, including comparing to Japan and NYC. The ramen came with four small containers of things to add, including pickled ginger and mashed sesame seeds.  Really bummed by the service but liked the final product overall. Maybe it was an off night, but I'm not sure I could fully recommend this spot given the issue with getting my dish."}
