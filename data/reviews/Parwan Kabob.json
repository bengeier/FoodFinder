{"text":"I eat at this place on a regular basis, the food is great, service is very quick and the owner is super friendly and attentive.  I usually get the shami Kabob plate or the chicken and shami Kabob combo plate.  The quality of the food is very consistent every time I go it's always great.  The chicken and shami kabobs are always perfectly cooked, never dry, and the rice is also perfect every time."}
{"text":"Came to this place for lunch. He prepared everything fresh the wait wasn't long. The food was fantastic. The environment is not really set up for dine in.  Good place to check out for Afghan food. Support your local small businesses."}
{"text":"I am perplexed by the glowing reviews. Perhaps it's the Yelpers that have set them up for this downfall. I would be incline give them an extra star or two had it not been for the glowing reviews. Anyhow, let's get into it and this one will be a short one.  The chicken is tender yet is void of juices somehow. It's almost reminiscent of meat that's been heavily tenderized with some kind of tenderizer or has been stewing for way too long. The flavours are bland at best and I definitely do not taste much of the exotic spices from the middle east. The salad is regrettable with so much onions in it. I like onions but not a huge fan of onion salads. The dressing? Where is the dressing?   There you have it. That about sums it up. I wouldn't necessarily avoid this place if you are already here and starving but I think there are better places to dine in this area for sure."}
{"text":"Very tasty!  The bread is excellent. Nothing special on the Decour side definitely worth a visit"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Not bad but also not so good either.  Can't say it's my number one place to go but also can't say I will never go either.  It's worth giving them a try."}
{"text":"Love this!   My companion and I were looking for a place for a late lunch...3 PM late. We drove by a plaza with two food options, Lucky Chinese or Parwan Kabob. Since, I swore to never visit any \"Chinese\" restaurant with the word \"lucky\" or \"panda\" (for obvious reasons), Parwan Kabob was the winner by default.   The owner is genuine and attentive. The patrons all seem to be his long time friends. He has a long lover affair with food. He owned and operated the first Parwan Kabob in Germany and opened the second location in Toronto. He loves Canada. In Germany, he said, it is much easier to make a living. In Canada, it is much harder,;however, he has freedom of the mind. These simple yet powerful words had added a breath of humanity to his food.   Food is made to ordered at Parwan Kabob. We placed an order for a Doner Box with rice ($5.99, the owner had kindly accommodated our request for 1/2 fries and rice) and chicken breast kabob ($4.50) to share. The chicken döner was juicy, crispy and perfectly spiced. A rare combination, as most döners tend to be dried with the texture of plastic. I inhaled this plate of döner perfection. The hint of sumac made a world of difference! Unlike other restaurants of its kind, the yogurt sauce was thick and flavourful. It was not watered down. The salad was light and refreshing.The perfectly cooked chicken breast kabob was served with cucumber, tomato and yogurt. Juicy chicken breast, another anomaly in the world of culinary arts.   After devouring our first order, my companion wanted more döner goodness. \"Will you eat any if I get a wrap?\", he asked. I respectfully declined. After placing the second order, the owner warmed the flatbread on a griddle, allowing it to bubble into a magical ball. Döner meat, tomato, cucumber, lettuces, yogurt sauce were added onto the bread. At this point, my self-control is out the window. I could not resist and stole döner from my companion's wrap. It was well worth it.   Needless to say, after all the food, we had to be rolled out of the restaurant. My companion and I agree that Parwan Kabob serves one of the best döner in town. We were even talking about catering from Parwan Kabob for his firm launch party!"}
