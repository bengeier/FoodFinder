{"text":"Another addition of a Japanese joint to the College St neighbourhood!  Definitely a standard looking place with an average looking menu but I was quite surprised by the quality of the food. The sashimi platter was pretty top-notch with good/fresh quality fish! My partner ordered a couple of maki rolls which I wasn't able to try as I was on  carb-free diet but regardless, it looked amazing and was quite good as quoted by him. Their dishes were inexpensive as everything but the lunch specials were on a 50% off deal so the bill came up to be really cheap! What a steal!"}
{"text":"Located close to Kensington Market and UFT this place is definitely worth a try if your in for good quality sushi. The restaurant is composed of a wood furnish with an Asian theme. It sort of reminds me of GUU's or Arisu's interior. The place is also equipped with a bar in the back for all you alcohol fans. Service is also friendly.  Anyways....  I am a BIG maki/sushi fan and the rice is perfectly flavoured. Ingredients are all fresh. Spicy salmon rolls have tempura bits in it which gives a great texture. Their Rainbow roll is also good. Overall, the place is a little pricier than say Sushi World or Simon Sushi across the street but your paying for quality and a better ambiance.  Current Deal: Present your Student ID card and they pay the tax!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend after reading their sign outside. $10.95 for a bento box, we were intrigued. The decor was really nice, with black stone walls and a very modern look. The washroom was also very clean.  I got a pork katsu bento (+ shrimp tempura, extra $4.99), and my friend got the sushi (16 pcs) bento. The boxes came with Korean glass noodles, miso soup, green salad, vegetable tempura, 3 pcs of maki (cucumber and carrots), and 2 pcs gyoza. The food here is probably among the best Japanese that I've had. I was able to taste the seaweed on the maki, which was really refreshing. The pork katsu was crunchy, but not hot when it came, and ditto for the tempura. My friend had a nice assortment of sushi (salmon, shrimp, white tuna) and spicy salmon maki. Some of the sushi also fell apart while being picked up. However, I found the overall flavours of the meal made up for it.  My friend and I liked the bento boxes that we had, and were happy about the price. Great little sushi place on College. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I can't comment about the food since I was there for Victory Bell's CD release party. It was a dope show. This restaurant has a stage at the back, which was a good size. Tables were pushed to the side so people can get up close as well.  The only thing I got there was a Asahi beer, which came out to $5.50. Other than that, maybe one day ill come back for the food."}
{"text":"Was in the Kensington Market neighbourhood and wanted to try out a new sushi place. Decided on this place based on yelp reviews. My friend and I were there for dinner on a Thursday evening. I saw no specials (previous posts discussed the fifty percent off items at length).  The service was prompt and we were given a complimentary glass noodle dish that was decent. Unfortunately,the sushi was terrible. We had spicy salmon, dynamite, kamikaze, and yam rolls. The first one I tried was a salmon roll and it tasted odd to me. I tried one piece of each type, had a few pieces of the yam roll then decided to stop eating. My friend powered through the rest and texted me the next day saying the sushi \"wasn't sitting well\". I wouldn't recommend this place based on my experience."}
{"text":"Izakaya Sushi House is so far on exceptional place to be its a Japanese pub and sake bar.  They have a great special of 69 cent wings with the purchase of any type of beverage not to mention that they have great sushi the service is exceptional and they are very attentive I would most certainly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Prices are unreal for what you get!! Great quality, clean and super delish!!! Totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Like a few people have already stated, this place is great only because it has an ongoing 50% off their menu. The sushi is good, the place is new, the staff are friendly and for the time being meals are affordable. And according to the rumour mill (aka Susan G) they have a very nice private space that can be booked off for a function.  BE WARNED: once the special of half off everything you eat runs out, you're most likely going to come out of here disapointed that for $20 or so you could have had better sushi somewhere not too far from here.   But to be honest, spending $20 here on just a few pieces of sushi won't be the worst thing in the world."}
{"text":"As a fan of sushi, I am extremely happy Izakaya opened on College St.  They are now the best sushi deal around.    Their sushi is quite good and always plated impressively.... and their prices are extremely low.  The price does not reflect the quality... more so I believe they are just trying to get customers to come in since they are still quite new.  And it seems they are trying to figure out what their best strategy will be.  As other reviewers have mentioned they used to have all you can eat.  And although the ayce price was fantastic, the menu is more diverse now and an overall better meal.  Better fish, better quality.  For the portion size and good quality offered, for the prices they ask, you can't beat this place.    Good sushi and good atmosphere without the inflated prices.  Perfect."}
{"text":"The best way to describe my relationship with Izakaya Sushi house is to compare it to dating, at the beginning it's really nice and sweet, there is a rough period and you either break up or you find a balance.  Luckily, Izakaya and I have found a balance after we have matured (well, Izakaya has matured anyways).  We have had a love/disappointed (hate is too strong a word) relationship with Izakaya Sushi House.  You went from really good, to not very good (all you can eat that was not that great, see prev review) and now you are back to your old self.    \"I am glad that you realize that you were hurting our relationship when you decided to go AYCE, that crowd really doesn't know how to cherish you the way I do\"  It is now back to a regular sushi place and they have a promo 50% everything, it's been a few weeks and the sale is still on.  You can get a spicy salmon roll including tempura bits for $3 which is really reasonable.  (Bating eyelashes)  \"Oh Izakaya, let's never let anything come between us ever again\"  (Smile)  \"No one can ever love you the way I do, forget about those other sushi joints.  Don't compete, we love you just the way you are\""}
{"text":"I tried to come back to this place twice for lunch over the past week and both times they were closed, despite their business hours stating otherwise. Anyways we asked the owner and was told that they were doing renovations at that time.   We were then given the usual complimentary chapchae, a generous and delicious bowl of sesame glass noodles!  We ordered the chicken teriyaki lunch bento $10.50 which included miso soup (which they never brought - oops), salad, 3 pcs of veggie maki...meh, 4pc of crisp veg tempura and 2pc shrimp tempura, and of course a nice portion of chicken teriyaki atop stir fried veggies with steam rice. It was a decent size but not enormous.  Next we had 4 different rolls including the rainbow roll, premium salmon roll, Alaska roll, and spider roll. We also ordered 2pc sake, and 2pc butterfish sashimi a la carte.  Despite the nice presentation, the rolls were not filled as I would have liked and they were on the small side. The Alaska roll was crab salad (of the mayo variety) topped with thinly sliced butterfish, and the spider roll look like a small dynamite roll. The other two were California based but topped with thin slices of assorted fish. The fish tasted fresh but it was it was on the warm side. The 4pc of sashimi I ordered were accidentally bright out as Nigri, if I wanted sushi like this I would have just gone to an AYCE place.   Luckily they still have the redeeming qualities of their beautiful venue and generous chapchae starter. The 50% discount offered on the special maki and dinner items make their overpriced menu very reasonable and the 99c/ounce saki is a steal!   So I'll be back for sure, but hopefully they don't slip in terms of quality or im gone like wind."}
{"text":"\"Wait a minute, I shouldn't order sushi...it can't possibly be edible at these prices?\" I say looking skeptically.  \"Well, sushi is actually cheaper in Canada than the U.S.\", my companions retort.  \"It's still not possible, but I'll just risk food poisoning...all the hard work for my visit is done.\"  Ok, so my friends were right.  The sushi was tasty and fresh in a bento box available from 11 AM to 11 PM.  I was pretty impressed.  The accompanying salad and obligatory miso soup were good.  How much does this cost?  Just under $9!    The other bento boxes were even cheaper and it seemed that everyone enjoyed their lunches.  Service was good.  The decor is actually quite upscale for a place with such cheap food.  This may be my new winner in the \"cheap sushi\" category."}
{"text":"Izakaya Sushi House confused me at first - I went in noticing online the giant \"IZAKAYA\" sign, and was pretty disappointed to just see a menu of sushi.   HOWEVER - I was pleasantly surprised by my experience! The 50% off menu seemed too good to be true - so we clarified with our server, and in fact, a ton of dinner sets and maki rolls are 50% off!   I had a sashimi dinner (about $9 with the discount) and a dragon maki ($4.50 with discount). The food came out beautifully presented and super fresh. They even brought us a complementary app of glass noodles (MMM!)   The restaurant itself is really nice as well - the decor has an upscale look and the dark lighting gives it a really nice ambiance.   The only thing about Izakaya Sushi House, is that if the 50% off deal ends, I will definitely stop coming. While the prices are currently AMAZING, at full price they become really pricey. My sashimi dinner was an amazing deal at $9, but at $18 would have been ridiculously over-priced. I hope the 50% off promo becomes a regular deal, which would definitely keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"They seem to have 50% off everything on the menu. I have the feeling they will just keep this \"special\" deal going on for months and months or possibly forever as a pricing strategy to get more people in.  Either way, at the 50% off prices everything is reasonably priced and the food is actually really good and beautifully presented. I had a crunchy salmon roll and a tuna sashimi portion which came to about $9 included tax. If it had cost $18 I definitely would have said it was a rip off, as portions weren't huge. But for $9, A-OK.  Service was really good and the food was beautifully presented. Tuna sashimi turned into two small sized roses and lots of garnishes on the plate.  The interior was redone with dark wood paneling and it was quite nice. I can't see this place ever being ridiculously busy, but I'll go back as long as the 50% off menu remains."}
{"text":"I went to Izakaya for lunch today and had their 7.95 bento box that had 14 pieces of sushi (I chose California Roll and the Crabtempura Roll). It was accompanied to Korean glass noodles, miso soup, and salad as well. Altogether, it's very filling and affordable for lunch."}
{"text":"I have been to a few sushi places in Toronto and Izakaya is by far the best in terms of quality for a great price.  Other places charge you over 20$ for all you can eat and you can grab a wicked deal at Izakaya for all you can eat at around 15$ or grab a bento box for under 10$. The prices, quiet atmosphere, location and quality of the food makes it my favourite sushi restaurant. I do think they should include endamame on the all you can eat menu. Several vegetarian options."}
