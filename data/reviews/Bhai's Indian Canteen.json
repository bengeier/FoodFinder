{"text":"Nice and clean interior and ambiance. Awesome restroom. The food and service were really good. Waiters were helpful and nice. Food was flavorful and tasty. I'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"It's difficult to find good Indian restaurant in GTA and being an Indian our taste buds seek for the best in the crowd. This nice little restaurant is located conveniently on 404 & highway 27 and is affiliated with a famous Indian restaurant chain 'The Host'. It is more of a boutique themed restaurant with some highly selected menu representing food culture of different parts on India - from Northern India  (Rajeshtani ghatey) to western India  (Mumbai wada pawn) to southern India  (dosa) - all vegetarian only.  Good: Food is served in a style - stacked Tiffin box; desserts in martini glasses...it adds fun. And most importantly, it is extremely tasty - not too oily/spicy that u may see in typical restaurant who don't care about preparation. It's a balance between typical indian home n restaurant grade food. Very polite and friendly servers. Prices are damn cheap compared to the quality of food.  Bad: There might be a delay in service (we went on Saturday night) and there was only 1 server helping around 10 tables... later someone else joined.  Ugly: Finding parking stop can be challenging. Only those lucky ones get one of those handful nearby spots. Might have to walk a bit."}
{"text":"Great value, good food and warm stylish decor.  Bought the Yelp special $35 dollar voucher for $25.   The dishes ordered Massala Dota and some spicy potato pancake  (please see pics )was delicious , not too salty or oily.  I wish they had more spicy condiments available or if they did perhaps let us know as it would have been great if the dishes were a bit more spicy.  I even ordered dessert (called \"koffee\" ice cream with a twist of decorative white noodles  ). which I rarely do.  I felt full but in a light satisfying way.  As for the decor they did a great job, I felt like I was on vacation somewhere in a new district in  Asia, made me forget that I was in Richmond hill!  Would definitely come back and recommend friends."}
{"text":"Poor service, immature stubborn waiter (Geet), food tastes below average, less food portion for the price you are paying, ZERO customer satisfaction. DO NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Its awesome place 5 stars for food, 5 stars for ambience, 5 stars for service.....anything and everything is worth every penny......really Njoyed.....Best pure veg indian food in canada....there r very few authentic indian restaurant and this ones is 1st on the list..."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest I'm not even a vegetarian and I came here by accident. However, this is probably the best mistake of my life!!! This also happens to be my first time trying Indian food and they nailed it. This was a very pleasant surprise! First off, when you walk in the vibe is great and the decor was nice as well as very modern. The food is awesome too!! The cauliflower order was just ancbhandbajdhwhtjwjjf ( I have no words to explain how good it was). But yes the food: great, service: great, ambience: great. The food is a little spicy too but very tasty. I recommend this to everyone not just vegetarians! A solid 5 stars"}
{"text":"Heard about this new little place from some colleagues and decided to go there for dinner. We reached around 7:30pm on Saturday evening and it was snowing. Finding a parking spot in this complex was a fight- which often is a good indication of restaurant's popularity.   We stepped in and were welcomed by manager with a warm smile. Decor was very nice and trendy. They have a one page Menu with catchy dish-names. We ordered chilli panner, a tiffin and some kebab starters.   Kebabs were warm and good in taste. I wish they were little more spicy and hot. I will give it 3 stars. They should serve some chutneys on the side which you would usually expect with kebabs.  Chilli paneer was not good as against my high expectations. I read other reviews and many ppl had recommended this dish. It was not spicy which contradicted the very nature of the dish. Panner was not as soft as one would expect in this dish. However, the one thing which put me off was the sauce- if I have to write this in a subtle way, it appeared that this was prepared by an amateur. Sadly, mixed with high expectations and previous good reviews, I cannot give more than 1 star for this dish after my experience.   Tiffin for $14 is good and I would recommend you to definitively try it. It was served with fresh Naan which was really nice and crispy- just the way we want. It comes with 4 little tiffin boxes. The presentation will just remind you of your college days. If i have to rate the tiffin, i would rate it 4.5"}
{"text":"New Indian place at Hwy7 and Beaver Creek, definitely refreshing to see a hip Indian, that also vegetarian, place open in this part of the GTA!  The decor: 5 stars! Very detailed and nice touches throughout.  The service: 5 stars! The traditional Indian hospitality at its best!  The food: mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"We arrived at Bhai's for an early dinner at 6pm on a Thursday, and we were their first customers for the night.    We ordered everything to share, and started with the Tandoori Momos (dumplings in chilli garlic marinade).  The dumplings were soft and delicious, and were served with a spicy dipping sauce that gave just the right kick.  I was hoping for some really spicy curry for the main, unfortunately they don't have that on the menu, so we proceeded with the Rajasthani Gattey (Rahasthani gram flour dumpling in yogurt churry) which was a mild curry and Palak Paneer (spinach and homemade cheese).  Both were really interesting and I can't say which one I liked better!  We added the garlic nan for dipping.    Overall a great experience, I recommend Bhai's if you are looking for authentic Indian cuisine!"}
{"text":"We have only been here once, but I believe this is one of the best Indian restaurants in the GTA (right up there with Indian Street Food co. and Sindhi). When we saw the decor and menu it was hard to believe it was host's sister restaurant, as it had a characterstic Hemant Bhagwani charm to it. I would look forward to chef Sanjeev Sethi's creations from now on too.  The dishes in their Tiffin shiffin are the ones that you don't usually find in restaurants like Tindey, Gattey, Paneer bhurji, Rajma, Bhey. Hope they'll add some of the more conventional dishes to the menu as well. The small bites menu is very different too and I would love to try them all. Every item on the menu is very much inviting and it'll probably take a few visits to try them all.  The service at the restaurant was top-notch. They took good care of us. Also, we really appreciated their patience with a patron who was exceptionally annoying. They explained each dish on the menu to her with ingredients; portion sizes; the reason behind the prices for whatever they are. Hats-off.  My only gripe is that there is nothing non-vegetarian on the menu. My wife being a strict vegetarian; the only time I get to eat non-veg is when we eat out. Now this being her new favorite, I'm sure we'll have to make a few treks back."}
{"text":"Come eat here. The decor is amazing and the sights and smells of this food is a pleasant experience.  They clearly care about ambience, with low-key Indian music in the background, a very high attention to service (dinner, Tuesday night) and the place looks really clean.  A few minor things which would greatly improve my 1st impression include 1) power washing the gross spilled food on the sidewalk immediately adjacent to the front door, 2) dimming or covering the jarring 5000K LED light coming from the upright beverage cooler standing in the restaurant, which really hurts the overall theme of wood and yellow tones throughout with this fake, artificial-colored light and 3) removing the napkins underneath the iron pipe table legs and simply turning the pipe caps on the end until the table is balanced.  Indian food and me exist in harmony since my first visit to Bangalore ~10 years ago when each person at our 3-day meeting was brought a box of ~7-8 different things, and I always ate them all. This Indian Canteen is quite a place,"}
{"text":"Don't care how good the food or service is. When it takes 45 mins during lunch time to get your food on the table, 1 star is all you get."}
{"text":"A vegetarian Indian restaurant going off the theme of Indian street food - sounded like a really great idea until it didn't. They've shortened their lunch menu to include only ten \"express\" items now, cutting out a bunch of the chaat options. I'm okay with a smaller menu if it delivers, but unfortunately it didn't really. The lunch tiffin portion sizes are incredibly stingy for $15 and the flavors don't really come through. The butter paneer masala tasted sort of like a Haldiram's frozen package of paneer, and the tomato soup also tasted like it came from a packet. I enjoyed the gangan burger though (veggie burger with hakka noodles).   I'm giving this place 3 stars because the server was very friendly throughout the meal, which goes a long way. Maybe it'd be better to come here for dinner so you can dine off their bigger menu."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this a 3.5 overall.  Beautiful restaurant, good service, cool plating and average food.  5 stars for atmosphere, presentation and the instaworthy pics. I mean it's so trendy, the tiles are beautiful, and  it has the rustic/trendy/chic thing going on. The service was attentive.   The food was decent. Portion sizes could be better as could the flavour/taste. I love myself some Indian food and although this wasn't the best, it wasn't the worst either. You're paying for the experience cause it is not the cheapest.   Grab some friends, eat some okay Indian vegetarian food in a beautiful restaurant with gorgeously plated food!"}
{"text":"Food was nice but what we realized was that they were short staffed..everyone seemed frazzled.  We loved the presentation of the food."}
{"text":"If I could review components separately it would be: service:  5 star decor/ambience:  5 star food:  3 stars  I was very excited to learn of a new vegetarian Indian restaurant close to home.  I really really wanted to love it but the food fell a short of expectations.  mr leny and I shared the onion/chili dosa and the choley sholey palak paneer tiffin.  Unfortunately the dosa was extremely greasy and not light and crispy as expected.  The filling was flavourful and spiced well.  It was accompanied by sambar, coconut and red chutney.  I liked the sambar very much as it was not as salty as others I have had.    The tiffin came with spinach paneer, chickpeas, rice, salad and parantha.  Both the paneer and chickpea were very good and flavourful.  The parantha was flakey but quite greasy like the dosa.  The mukhwas offered afterwards was a very nice touch.  I liked that it was not candied.  If we return we would not be ordering the dosa again."}
{"text":"A favourite place of mine and my coworkers whenever we are craving Indian food. We've been here several times and the food here is amazing and great for sharing. The servers are also friendly and attentive.   We usually order a few tiffin shiffin to share, and an appetizer. So far, everything we've tried is delicious which keeps us coming back. The Tiffin shiffin are $12 during lunch, and fyi, the Manchurian veggie balls and crispy cauliflower have the exact same sauce, so get either 1."}
{"text":"As always I prefers to give a little bit about me before I start, so that people reading get a sense of where I'm coming from. I am an avid, Like AVID meat eater but I have to have my veggies when I cook for myself. This is much harder to achieve when my partner and I eat out especially when you get pretty sad veggies on the side when you get a delicious steak. Hence my love for Bhai's which is usually really delicious even though I'm still exploring the full range of the menu and trying to figure out what my go-tos are.   The number one recommendation I HAVE to give is to get the is the Lotpot Ki Chaat. This is simply the dish that made me fall in love with Bhai's. We've been 3 times and we had it 3 times and with friends as well and the result is the same, pure bliss (Also I'm Chinese/Vietnamese, so my knowledge of Indian cuisine is somewhat limited). I love the interplay of tart and sweet and the crunch of the dish. I usually lick the yogurt tamarind sauce off my plate. Now my photos will reflect my latest meal which happened after I decided to yelp my experiences but I have had more than just the food I will be reviewing.   The Naan is excellent (especially in garlic) it's got a good texture, good chew and just good flavour. The Chai is flavourful and comes with biscuits. The Ghattey Shattey is for me a mixed bag it tart, sour, spicy. It has a rainbow of flavour, some of the items were a little intense for me, especially the tart sourness but the spice has a good level and it has a depth of flavour. They also come in these stacked copper bowls. It more food than it looks when you look and see these tiny bowls. The Masala Dosa is a fun cone of dough slightly crispy. I got the Rajasthani Gattey and I must say it was probably the closest to where I prefer my balance of spice and overall complex curry flavour. I mean my recommendation is to just try different things.   The Corn Chaat is crispy and has the sweetness of the corn as well as the spice and the crispiness of the crispy Poori shell. Also we had the pleasure to try the Gulab Jamun one day and it's reminds me of a warm version of a Loukoumades. Too sweet for my liking, but my girlfriend loved it. I appreciated the warm temperature made it easier to deal with the honey like sweetness.   As you can tell I get a little lost in searching my memory and trying to explain the food with words I don't quite have yet. Also I'm writing the WHOLE review with the menu open on my laptop so I can get the spelling right and matching up the photos on yelp sadly enough.   The place is homey but also artsy with the fixtures and the artwork on the walls. The staff are very helpful and happy to make recommendations as well as explaining and telling you about the ingredients in the food (yes I did ask about the Lotpot Ki Chaat). The service always ends with fennel seeds and sugar in this tiny little pressure cooker pot. Cute and different from you usually mint wrapped in plastic.   Overall I will continue to come here for the chai and Lotpot Ki Chaat and will continue to try the other menu items and be pleasantly surprised as I discover more dishes that I like."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and pleasant servers. Food quality is good but the portions are small and very pricey for what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Very nice Indian restaurant. They serve vegetarian dishes. The atmosphere and decoration is great. Service is on point. Food was really good. Only complaint is that the portions were smaller, hence the 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Bhai's canteen is a place where all 5 senses are engaged to make it a memorable dining experience. The food is visually appealing as well, promises an authentic treat to your tastebuds. The presentation is creative but also very smart (e.g. the dosa with a pyramid shape looks great and also keeps the paper crisp!). The attention to detail is remarkable (the chai comes with biscuit - CLAP!). Taking a star off only because in my recent visits I've found the service a little disconnected. But highly recco this to take guests, friends, coworkers - the presentation of food will make for great conversation!  Reccos: pani puri, lotpot chaat, kurkuray bhindi, dosa"}
{"text":"I'm no expert on Indian cuisine but I had a great experience here.  Their menu includes Northern and Southern Indian cuisine, and also Indian street foods.  We had the bhel puri which was on their high tea menu. Great texture and flavourful. A little bit too spicy for me but it added a great kick of flavours.  Lotpot ki chaat - chilled yogurt snack with chickpeas, potatoes and crispy poori. We really liked this! Sweet chutney with savoury components with the spices. Lovely app covered in yogurt  We got the tiffin shiffin gattey shattey with a side of naan. This whole dish had great depth of flavours. Many spices were present, good spice level. Overall yummy dish!  The decor gives this place a hipster vibe which I really enjoyed. Reasonable price food as my friend and I were stuffed in the end and excellent service!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. They offer vegan options for people who are vegan and service is great !"}
{"text":"Love the options on the menu! Great vegetarian restaurant! Nice cute causal little place with a family restaurant feel. Food is good and the staff are super friendly. Would come back to try their other items!"}
{"text":"Decor 5/5 Service 5/5 Food 5/5  I'm not a big Indian food guy, but dang!  I didn't care how spicy everything was but everything from the tiffin shiffin (palak paneer) to the Naan was done just perfectly. The food made me salivate from the presentation, but the food also tasted amazing!   As an Asian couple, we recommend lot pot ki chaat, crispy Cauliflower, and the paneer bhujuri. We also had a birthday cake for our friend, and they added some extra decorations on the plate and a candle which was A+ attention to detail and device!"}
{"text":"A group of us went here for the first time.  Since most of us aren't familiar with vegetarian Indian dishes, the server took the time to give us an overview of the menu and answered all of our questions.    The menu was full of cute rhymes.  I ordered the gattey shattey from the tiffin shiffin section of the menu.  It came with several small containers of different dishes (dumplings, rice, mixed vegetables and yogurt curry) as well as several pieces of nan.  This was a lot of food for $14.  Everything was delicious.    We appreciated the big bottles of water on our table; no need to bother the server each time we wanted to refill our glasses.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"\"There is a bit of vegetarian in all of us\"... Not me! I'm 100% vegan!  I honestly gave up on Indian restaurants in the GTA area long time ago, but I decided to pay this one a visit since its vegetarian. I'm so glad that I did!  I ordered the masala biryani (no yogurt). It was served in a clay dish. It was delicious and flavorful. I also tried their masala dosa. It was a bit oily but delicious nonetheless. They do offer \"Hakka Chinese\" items in case you prefer Chinese food.   Great service, decent portions, and reasonable prices. Overall this is one of the best Indian restaurant that I have visited in the area and I strongly recommend it. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We had a friend try this place and raved about it, so we gave it a try.  It was delicious. We had Pani puri shots which was amazing. Great presentation. We also had chenna batura which also was great. My sister had the raja and loved it as well. Honestly, you cant go wrong. It is the same owners as the Host. They put a lot of attention to details which is always nice. Bathroom was clean, modern and trendy. The sink was made out of a tire!!"}
{"text":"As the vegetarian spin-off of The Host, Bhai`s is hidden away and tucked in the East Beaver Creek plaza.  First off, I am always a sucker for vegetarian eats.  It is even more impressive when you`ve walked away from a meat-less meal, not noticing that it was, in fact, meatless.  I feel that it`s a bit late for me to realize this, but apparently Indian cuisine is quite well known for being vegetarian.  (Ambience:) When me and my friend first walked in, we were pleasantly surprised by how decorative the place was.  It had Indian-style furnishings and we were even served curry in little tin pots.  I really enjoy these little things as it adds to the experience.  (Food:) I got the PANEER BUTTER MASALA which came with two little tin pots of homemade cheese curry and lentil puree.  I definitely liked the curry better than the puree, but both were nice.  I tried the pakora for the first time (not bad) and love that it comes with both rice and naan, so you can dip either into the sauces.  My friend got the BHARTHA, which was basically the same as mine, excepted she got mashed eggplant in the tin pot (SO GOOD)  (Drinks:) The set lunch came with free CHAI TEA which complements the meal quite well.  (Price:) Both set lunches were part of the Express Lunch Menu: $15  (Service:) Amazing service!  All the servers were so nice, and one of them even gave us an extra samosa so we could try it!  (Overall:) I liked it! But, Rajdhani Sweets was still best and deserved my 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came to Richmond hill to visit a friend and tried this place out for the first time. Loved the service, our server Dev, was amazing, gave us recommendations. Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Really really good food. The service is great as well, the staff is really friendly and welcoming. We loved this place and would recommend everyone to go here and try their food."}
{"text":"Ambience & decor: Trendy, Industrial Chic with Indian ethnic decor mixed in.   Food & service: Staff is very welcoming - and accommodating of requests. The place is all vegetarian. Hooray! The appetizers and entrees have interesting names, are different from the usual fare. They are presented in a beautiful copper tiffin ware.   For dessert we had gulab jamun & kulfi. The gulab jamun unlike many other places was not scaldingly hot but pleasantly warm.   This is Host's answer to the 'Indian Street Food Co' or Sindhi's. Will I come back? Heck, yes. I have try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Tasty vegetarian indian food made fresh while you wait, ask for your apps first, little slow with orders, but very polite and responsive servers, portions could be a little larger since you are only getting vegetables. Chai is strong, may not be to your taste. Little bit pricey for vegetarian."}
{"text":"A vegetarian Indian restaurant located in Richmond Hill is refreshing.  It's a small place but we managed to fit a large group of about 8-10 of us here.   Lots of locals were dining here, which is a great sign!  The menu is simple but with lots of different options.  The tiffins (the curries), South Indian section, apps and a small section for Chinese Indian style food.  The tiffins come with the curry, rice, naan.  I wanted to really get one of these but I was wearing a pale beige blouse and I knew I was going to f*ck it up eating curry..lol (I came from a work meeting)   I decided to go for the masala biryani b/c I just love me some biryani.   This was pretty delicious and a little spicy which gave it some nice flavors.  It was a little more 'wet' style of biryani than I care for (I personally prefer the Hyderabadi style of biryani that tends to be more 'dry').  Sorry this is the only way I can describe my preferences - wet/dry...lol.  The portion at first looks small but it's actually a decent size.  I'd probably order this and one of the tiffin's and share amongst 2-3 people.  The service is super friendly, the server answered all the questions that several of the other diners had about the food as they were not familiar with this type of cuisine.  I'll definitely come back here when in the area."}
{"text":"Came here to try new vegan place. This was vegetarian so close enough  They have vegan options the south Indian food is all vegan according to the server. I had the masala dasa very nice and tasty the food is good I had some byriani too which was great. The server was very nice and friendly. The place is very lovely and nice they play indian music which add to the theme. The menu is not fully translated some stuff I had no idea what they are. The server did a  good job explaining it. But will be nice to see the description for all foods. Will come back."}
{"text":"The resturant was referred by a vegetarian friend. We tried going here on a Monday, but it was closed. We ended up coming back months later and I must say its one of the best Indian's I've tried.   The interior is nice and nicely planned and cozy for all types of groups. It does get busy at peak hours, so I do recommend settling in before then or do take out.   The Food was phenomenal. I got the 'tiffin shiffin (palak paneer)' and that was so GOOD! It was a little spicy which is exactly how I wanted it and robust in flavour. The nan bread. My goodness, hands down I could eat the all of it.  I highly recommend anyone who wants to try Indian cuisine food. I used a promo voucher that they offered $35 for $25. Definitely worth the promo if you want to save a little.   I will definitely be coming back to try other items on the menu.   5/5 Stars"}
{"text":"Wow - I had no idea that such an interesting Indian place opened up here so close by to Thornhill.  The food is 100% vegetarian. It is also served in a most interesting way - in the carrier tiffin boxes. Each main is served with 1 more veg dish, salad, chappati/Naan and rice. The three of us ordered Rajma, ghatte shatte de curry and lotus root kofta. All dishes were awesome and the side dish was a mixed squash curry - also excellent. Remember to ask for pickle and onion.   For dessert we ordered kulfi and gulab jamun and our son ordered Masala tea.  Every item was excellent. Prices are reasonable - this is an informal place but quite \"nice\" in terms of decor and serving presentation. $ 7-10 appetizers and $12-14 mains is quite reasonable. Service was friendly and we will surely be back."}
{"text":"We had a stop over at this cozy India restaurant. The food here was authentic with the right amount of spices. Just took us back to the Indian flavours."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Didn't served water jug. First order: beer but the staff totally forgot to serve it and actually didn't serve it even after dinner, totally forgot by the staff. Not recommended at all. Don't waste time when other better Indian options are available. Pathetic and not at all value for money."}
{"text":"This is a solid 3.5 stars. More than A-Ok but not quite Yay! I'm a fan. This restaurant just opened recently and my vegetarian friend wanted to go try it during lunch so we wandered over around 12pm. This is affiliated to The Host which is just up the street. We were the first ones there for the lunch rush and a few other tables filled up after us. The waitress was very helpful with the menu and very polite. She was very focussed on her work so when we were trying to get the bill, it was a bit harder to get her attention but this wouldn't be a problem normally outside of work lunch hours. I love the décor and ambiance of the place. There was a nice painted mural that leads to the bathroom. The menu is simple but diverse enough that you have several options for various appetites. I ordered the masala biryani $11 and fried okra which was $6 in the online menu but ended up being $7.50 at the restaurant and I didn't notice until after I left. My friend ordered the CHOLEY BHATUREY (chickpeas curry with fried bread) $9.50. The fried okra was delicious and I would order it again based on just taste but I'm not sure if it was worth $7.50 since I think there were only maybe 2 or 3 okras in the actual basket. It was chopped up into thin slices, fried and came with 2 sauces on top. I actually wanted more of the sauces to mix into the biryani which was kind of bland in comparison. It was a big portion that came in the clay pot that I didn't finish but it wasn't anything to write home about. My friend got the same impression from her chickpea dish - good but not great and needs a tad more flavour. Maybe they're trying to be healthier and use less salt? Or maybe they're still trying to work out their customers' preferences. When the bill came, we both received a coupon for a $5 discount on our next visit (minimum spend $25) and a comment card on how our experience was. I would definitely come back to try some of the other stuff especially since there's not a lot of vegetarian options for my friend that's also close to our work."}
{"text":"I liked the food here, it was a beautiful place. I didn't the low quantity of food that we got however and it was quite expensive. The food quality was alright however I do feel you get better for a lower price. Its nice to go there once in a while. If I were to recommend a dish, then I would suggest you to try the tandoori momos, they were excellent!"}
{"text":"Okay so this is the second  best Indian food I have ever had - first was in New Delhi... so yea I highly recommend it.  I ordered the lunch special tiffin .. which came in an actual tiffin.. and it came with paneer, rice, daal, and salad, and garlic naan. My husband ordered chole bhatura and it was also quite epic . I think I may have been Indian in my past life because this meal brought me back to a childhood I don't even remember"}
{"text":"The wait was about 15-20 mins.. I believe they do take reservations. Restaurant seats about 50 people. It is a small place. The decor is nice and very ethnic, they have paintings everywhere and little classic Indian items hanging on the walls. If you like chaat and street food this is a good place to come too! The okra was delicious! Seems like it was dipped in batter and deep fried, has a spicy but sweet taste to it. It also came with some banana chips that were nice! The spicy cauliflower was Chinese style, it was good and defiantly would be a good choice with Hakka noodles. We got the breaded pakoras.. kind of tastes like a samosa.. has potatoe inside. I did ask for some tamarind chutney on the side and I never received it. The lotpot chaat was delicious and comes in a canoli type shell.. it's a nice take on the regular chaat! The dosas looked good, and tasted good. But unfortunately the dosa was not crispy!!! Major minus point for that! It's the best part! The bathrooms though are awesome! There is a girl and boy on each door and it's a single stall. The sink is inside of a tire and the walls are black.. one wall has all different designs on it and pictures of guys.. it's interesting.. doesn't fit with the theme of the restaurant but I absolutely love it!! Food was delicious! Will come back to try other items!"}
{"text":"Lovely little restaurant with friendly employees!! The server was very helpful and explained to us what certain items were. My boyfriend and I decided to be adventurous and got the Lotpot Ki Chaat, a chilled appetizer. IT WAS SO GOOD. We had to hold back from licking the plate clean! I got a Ghattey Shattey while the boyfriend got Tinday Shinday and a Chai tea.   The food came in cute little tins! It was deceivingly filling; definitely got my money's worth of food. Everything tastes great, had a good kick to it.   The Chai tea came in a full teapot with some yummy cookies! The server recommended their homemade ice cream for dessert but they ran out so we had the Gulab Jamun. As the server described it, it was like a timbit donut with syrup. It tastes WAY better than it sounds, but careful it was piping hot! Overall a wonderful and delicious experience - I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wow, offbeat Indian food. Yet authentic! Friendly staff. Cute Interior! Reasonably priced!  And close to my house! Hahaha  I ordered a platter- gattey shattey, and my hubby ordered Rajma-platter, they are mini platter sufficient for a person. It comes with naan, raita, rice, 2 curries- one of them is gattey- a Rajasthani dish made from graham flour. Another curry is curry of the day, but I replaced it with daal. And you have the choice of bread.  For me all the dishes were great. Even the jeera rice was, good grade basmati, aromatic and sautéed with onions, cumins and ginger.  Gobhi Manchurian or some similar name was not good, too blend. I would not try any other Hakka dishes here. North Indian and Street food snacks were good like pav bhaji etc.  I am planning to visit the place again with friends so that we can try more of their dishes.   The best of the place is, every dish on the menu is not what you find in typical \"Indian restaurant\".  The spice level was okay as per Canadian standards, less spicy as per Indian standards.  The service needs a lot of improvement though. Ther server would not come to ask you for anything, you need to call them again and again, no condiments on the table, water is served just once, no refills. When we asked for water, the server didn't bring it and yet started to set-up the adjacent table for next morning, instead."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Ordered a variety plate that came with curried pumpkin, lentils, rice and yoghurt sauce. Added the garlic nan.    The decor is simple and comfortable.  Great service and nice food presentation.    Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Affiliated to The Host, right off Highway 7 & 404, this new place offers food which invokes memories of a college canteen. Albeit with much, much better food. And service!  We drove over 70kms to try the 'Tiffin' and weren't disappointed. Let me start with parking which is a nightmare. Don't waste time trying to find a spot nearby. Head down to Moxie's or Keg and walk back.  The place is much smaller than this appears to be in pics but it's got a nice modern vibe to it.   We were immediately greeted with a smile and after waiting for 5 mins for a large party to leave, seated.  Started off with Mumbai Vada Paav which was amazing! Soft and delicious. Followed up with Khumb Main Seekh (Mushroom Kebabs). I'm not a big fan of mushrooms but these cheese filled, soft balls of cotton just melted away.  Chose 'Gattey Shattey' which is an authentic Rajasthani dish. It comes with a crispy laccha paratha, a chef's special (got Potato + Green Pepper + Panner fry), rice and salad. Really enjoyed everything. Gattey themselves were soft and properly cooked in a homely gravy of onions and tomatoes.  Was told that the Tiffin serving isn't large enough for two people, so got Masala biryani. Tasty, healthy and fresh.   We were very happy with friendly and attentive service. The food itself was worth the long drive. A light hearted affair both on the wallet and the tummy unlike it's granddaddy. Hope they keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Bhai's Canteen is a bit hard to find, but it's a really awesome spot for some vegetarian Indian cuisine.   I really love vegetarian options and seeing that this place was entirely vegetarian was great! Immediately upon entering you are greeted with a warm aroma of spice and great smelling food. The ambience is also great - it's really nicely decorated. Upon entering, I was seated immediately.   The menu, though descriptive, was a bit hard to understand as I didn't know which dishes were stand alone a or had accompaniments, but the waiter was quite to help and answer any questions. After looking at the menu for a few minutes, I decided on paneer \"tiffin shiffin\" which comes in little metal dishes stacked on top of each other. The dishes appear small but they are packed to the brim, and you actually get quite a bit of food. I had a hard time finishing all my food. The presentation is perfect for sharing though!    The food arrived quite swiftly, I was really impressed by the wait time. The meal also came with some fresh naan, which was great! The curries themselves were very fresh and flavourful. The dishes taste quite authentic.   The pricing was a bit high, but definitely worth it. All in all, a solid choice for Indian or vegetarian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Again this place was our random find and to quench our thirst for indian street food took us here. We were surprised to see this restaurant crowded on weekdays in the evenings. It has good ambience with good options from South Indian food to indian Chinese. We ordered vada Pav n paneer wrap and both tasted decent. Even Chinese  fried rice was fine enough and to find such a place in Richmond hill is a good catch."}
{"text":"Bhai's Indian Canteen is now at top of my list when it comes to delicious Indian food. I wasn't very familiar with the names they used (yes, I speak 'butter chicken') but the descriptions provided were very helpful and the waiters provided us with recommendations as well.   I started off with the Lotpot ki chaat which was a cold appetizer. It had a crispy shell with chick pea and potato filling, and was drenched in a rainbow of sauce. It was VERY flavourful--sweet with hints of orange, a little sour from the yogurt, and a tad savoury from the chickpeas. I really enjoyed it, but because I had to finish the entire dish myself, it got a little too sweet and overwhelming for me (and I ended up not finishing the entire thing). I think it's a great dish for sharing and it was definitely something I've never had before, but I may order something else next time.  I also got their Tiffin Shiffin dish with Gattey Shattey and THIS was what I was looking for and it was delicious! It came with nan, rice, and the curry + vegetables of the day. The nan was super fluffy and bread-y (I loved it), the curry was perfectly spicy and was very flavourful (although with the gattey shattey it comes with these \"flour dumplings\" in the curry which I did not particularly love) and the vegetables were also spicy but so so good. It was just the perfect meal with a bit of everything.  When you ask for the check, they give you a little container of fennel seeds+sugar which I've been told helps out like mints after a meal. Pretty cool!  Overall, the restaurant was clean and modern, the service was attentive and kind, and the food was delicious! I will definitely be visiting again to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"Very good Indian food, and all vegetarian. We shared Tandoori Momos, Paneer Tikka wraps, and Dal Maharani (black lentils). The black lentil dal was far and away our favourite. The service is very friendly (the server patiently answered questions and made good recommendations) but also rather slow. The extra rice and naan we ordered part way through the meal took forever to arrive."}
{"text":"By far one of the best vegetarian Indian restaurants I've been to in the GTA and I'm a picky guy when it comes to food. Our total bill was $61 for 3 people with taxes, before tips. We got to experience so many dishes, all tasty and full of flavour. The staff was friendly and polite. We did need to wait for the food to be prepared for a little while but it was so worth it.  Bottom line: if you love Indian food like I do, and you happen to be in the neighbourhood, you have to check out this place.  TIP: I suggest you purchase the $35 voucher for $25 through the Yelp mobile app if you know ahead of time that your total bill will most likely exceed $35. Ours did and we saved $10 by buying the $35 voucher."}
{"text":"Great service, variable option for veggie people,reminds you India's  cafe and street, Adrak chai, masala chai is live made in front of you. Food quality is five star. Cozy atmosphere nice Indian cafe, good place to hang out,"}
{"text":"I like the concept of Indian vegetarian restaurant. I enjoyed my visit at Bhai's Indian Canteen.  Lunch though has a limited menu but I like how it is set up so I can have a taste of a few items, especially I usually dine in alone.  The decor is refreshingly modern with an Indian flair.   Tiffin Shiffin\": Choley Sholey Tey Palak Paneer serves in small tin container with rice and naan. I enjoyed the flavour but the portion definitely on the smaller size for the price. But good thing is that means I have room for dessert! I ended up ordering Galub Jamum, Sweet!!  I have yet come for dinner but seems like a good choice to come with some of my vegetarian friends so we can enjoy the food together!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I came here for our \"date night\" and this place didn't disappoint us at all! Highly recommend to those who want to try different/ authentic Indian food from the streets in India. Food is generally on a spicy side though and would advise those who can't handle spice to let the waiter know in advance.   We would definitely come back for more..."}
{"text":"Very good food , new twist to old names , excellent service. Good variety of vegetarian options , new concept of serving"}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant in a quieter corner of the crazy East Beaver Creek/Highway 7 madness. We were able to find parking quickly. We came at around 8:00 pm on a Saturday night and although they were very busy, we were able to get a table right away.   So many choices! We ordered the lotpot ki chat, which was kind of like a cold crispy roll with a medley of chickpeas and potato inside. It was served with yogurt and chutney and was perfectly flavored and crispy. We also ordered the Hakka noodles, Masala Biryani and garlic naan. Portions were great especially for the price! The food was very flavorful and spicy. I just wish there was a spice-level indicated on the menu for people like my fiance who typically can't handle too much.   We will definitely return and try many of their other dishes as everything that came out of the kitchen looked and smelled flavorful.   P.S. we used the Yelp $25 for $35 deal with no problems."}
{"text":"Well i had more expectations from the place than what was served on the plate. The portions are really small. The mushroom starters were sort of cold with few drops of chutneys. Chilli paneer was more of paneer ki sabzi in onion n tomato gravy with really hard paneer chunks. Tiffin and friendly service were the only good part about the place. It's a below average counterpart of host and I would much rather prefer host to this place."}
{"text":"Great food with interesting selections. Amazing staff. My go to place for Dinner when I visit Markham."}
