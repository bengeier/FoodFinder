{"text":"Great bar & good food...better than the other Cave Creek bars!!  Lots happening & good staff.  Biggest drawback is outdoor seating. Need more high top tables in shaded areas, especially in about a month.  Nobody wants to watch an event in the summer here with no shade.  Hopefully the upcoming renovations will cover outdoor seating during summer months!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Cave creek for a week and came here a few times.   Great food! I recommend any of the salads as a wrap, burger, or the skewers.   They have rodeo events every Sunday. Theres other live entertainment throughout the week."}
{"text":"Again, wish I could give zero stars. My family was in town visiting and because Buffalo Chip was full we decided to go to Outlaw Annie's. As soon as we got there we had to move tables just to get aknowledged.. which didn't work either, so I had to go ask to get served. Thought things would go well after that, but after an hour of waiting for our food, I had to go ask where it was.. I was told they were backed up (aka: forgot, because I saw no one else ordering food, only alcohol). After 20+ minutes of waiting, I told them to please cancel order and that we needed to go because my daughter was starving and falling asleep. The food miraculously appeared, but the burgers were raw, hot dogs burnt and one order wasn't even what was ordered!! After that point our hungry table of 7 was done, and just wanted to go through a drive through for fast, friendly service. Please note what was ordered.. nothing that should take over an hour! And when a customer does complain, most businesses are willing to try and make things right. Patty, however didn't even want to comp 1 beer!!! When she said that, it was hard for a member of our group to leave satisfied and did speak his mind.... people have limits and this business pushed ours over the edge!"}
{"text":"Great new owners and reopened as Outlaw Annie's. Good food. Great view of the sunset. Someone said they're doing more renovating this summer. Looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Food was something to be desired. Small portions and margaritas tastes more like lemonade. Received the wrong bill. The only redemption was the wait staff were very friendly and attentive. Go for the entertainment not the food."}
{"text":"If I was asked a week ago what I thought about this place I would have rated it 5 stars, however, after our experience tonight if I could give them a zero star rating if I could.   The only upside to this place is the horse and bull riding, but you can get that over at Buffalo Chip and be treated with respect by staff.   Megan, the bartender, is the sole reason why they are receiving such a poor review. There were two of us and our dogs on the patio. Our dogs are well behaved (not my opinion, the opinion of the approximately 20 people who said hi to them over the course of the evening). From the beginning the service was subpar. Yes it's bike week, but the bar was less than 1/3 full. Another staff member or possibly Megan's boyfriend, who was incredibly intoxicated, decided to bring his dog over to our dogs without asking if it was okay. Immediately the dog was aggressive. Pulling at the end on his leash, standing on his rear legs, hackles up (the fur all down a dogs back), tail completely stiff and erect and staring intently at our dogs. All very typical behavior of a dog that any reputable trainer would not consider dog friendly. We were told Max, the dog, was friendly. My response was \"don't let your dog over here.\" When he was continued to allow to drag his owner over, I stood up between my dogs and max and told the owner to pull him away. At that point he did and sat a few bar stools down from us, while the dog continued to be out of control. After several minutes Megan decided to be incredibly rude and defend the dogs behavior. As a professional who has done this for 7 years and trained over 10,000 animals and 67 different species I explained that despite the fact she thinks her dog was abused the behavior is inexcusable. She continued to be rude and cuss at us. She threw the tab at us, mumbled something which we couldn't understand and walked away. At that point we paid our tab and were walking out. We were chased down again by the guy being dragged at the end of Max's leash. Again, he was told to back up and that we were not going to introduce our dogs. He continued to follow us out to the parking lot. We walked out of the restaurant without an incident, but I have no doubt in my mind there would have been one if we allowed the interaction to continue.   If you are looking for a dog friendly bar or restaurant to go to there are PLENTY around the Valley with good food and entertainment with staff who are respectful. Here are a few suggestions:   Harolds Any of the OHSO locations  Charr  Peaks and Valleys  Half Moon   Save your money, time, gas and potentially your dogs life and go to one of those places.  This place has potential, but toxic employees like Megan will cause the death of Outlaw Annie's."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. Long story short,  but my girlfriend and I  were told that they are not a biker bar and told to go to the bar next door. ( keep in mind this is during AZ. Bike week in Cave Creek) Well the other bars next to them and across the street  were packed so we went to OutLaw Annie's for some quiet time. Apparently they have enough business and don't need ours. No wonder their parking lot is always empty. I REfUSE TO SUPPORT ANY BUSINESS WITH THIS MENTALITY!Tried them before when they first opened but always terrible customer service. Every other Restaraunt in town has free parking, why does Outlaw Annie's charge $10.00 ? maybe because your customer service is terrible and your charging $ because people would rather spend there hard earned money where they are appreciated! You need to take customer service 101"}
