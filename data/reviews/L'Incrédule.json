{"text":"It was love at first sight (or first meal?) with this wonderful restaurant on Montreal's south shore. It is located in the nice neighborhood of \"Vieux Longueuil\" and have an open terrasse in the front and a large \"verrière\" in the back which is wonderful with the changing climate here and create a space which seems larger.  They have a formula where you can choose any entree and make it a set price menu by adding either soup and appetizer or appetizer and dessert. I opted for the former option.  My first course was a cold potage which was wonderful and did put me in a summery mind set on a spring that seems to be just a long fade-out of winter. I followed it with a warm goat cheese salad and had a delicious and generous salmon tartar as the main course. They are also serving warm fresh bread (as much as you dare eat).  Everything was perfectly executed and served in a very convivial and professional way. I will mention this little attention which made the experience even better; My friend (the one that brought me here and is responsible for this discovery) wanted to drink white wine (I drink red even with everything) and I was incline to have an apéritif before the meal but didn't want to drink to much. So, once we settled on a bottle of chardonnay, I asked the server if he could poor some cassis liquor in my first glass of wine (making it a kir) and he was very happy to obliged. That made for an excellent compromise! The kind of flexibility that is somewhat exceptional (but should not!) in the restaurant industry.  \"L'incredule\" instantly became one of my favorite table in town and it totally worth it to make a short trip from downtown Montréal to Longueuil to experienced it!"}

{"text":"Je suis allee lors d'un brunch improvise de lundi de Paques, c'etait ouvert contrairement a plein d'autres restaurants. C'est deja un plus.   Services: bon service tout droit sortie de l'ITHQ, mais pas tres chaleureux.  Nourriture: c'etait vraiment moyen. J'ai pris les oeufs benedictines qui etaient tres bon en soi, mais personnelent je les ai trouve cheap dans le jambon, ca goutait meme pas, je l'ai cherche lol! Les patates etait bonne mais rien de wow. Si non j'ai fait ma gourmande et pris un croissant...il etait horrible pour un bistro francais. On aurait dit que c'etait un croissant d'epicerie mis au four trop longtemp. Le cafe etait correct. Honnement, j'y retournetais pour re tester si je suis dans coin, question de voir si c'etait a cause de Paques. Mais sans grande attentes.   Prix: plus abordable que je pensais. Tip inclus: 23$ pour mes oeufs, cafe au lait et croissant.   Le plus interessant c'est le solarium arriere et la terrasse avant. Je me vois bien prendre un verre de vin la cette ete. En plus, pour les groupe c'est super grand, 2 etages."}
