{"text":"Brand new place.  How can they have reviews before Chrismas?

The food was fresh, but the service ... what service?  They don't know what they are doing!

Glad to have a place with the O-K Kosher symbol.  For a visitor like me, I appreciate a \"pita joint' with international kosher symbol and reputation, instead of just one rabbi.

I plan to review it in the future!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the pita and humus is soooo good. It's a new place. Go check them out  
We had the humus, shakshuka, falafel and it all was great. The service is homey and loving. You can see how much heart and soul they invested in this place. Since they are kosher they are not open on Saturday but they are open all other days of the week."}
{"text":"Best meal I've eaten in Vegas I felt like royalty! The hospitality and service was incredible and the price was very reasonable for such clean and delicious food!  I will recommend this place to all of my friends and family"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Las Vegas! Fresh, clean, good environment, amazing owners - what else can a person ask?! I recommend the Shnitzel pita and a plate of hummus  You will not find a better middle eastern food in Las Vegas and the area!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Service was quick and very good! Close to Strip. Very reasonable pricing. Wide variety of salads."}
{"text":"I can't really even give it one star. We had  a horrible experience here tonight. Drove all the way from Henderson. Got there at around 6:30 pm on a Sunday night.  We were told they had run out of all pita and lafa so they couldn't serve us anything!  Their excuse was that they make it all fresh everyday and when they run out, that's it.  They ran out before 6:30 on a Sunday night????? How do you run a business like that? Very frustrating. 

Won't be making the shlep again anytime soon."}
{"text":"An outstanding new addition to the Las Vegas Food Scene.

The food is tasty, and the service is great. 

As a bonus the portions are enormous!!!"}
{"text":"Best food in Vegas, as far as I am concerned. Prices were great, flavor was great. Pitot were real. It was super fast."}
{"text":"I really love this place. 

Hubby was craving falafel and hummus.
I opened up Yelp and Eric S. saved the day with his ROTD! No idea why I didn't know about this place but I'm very thankful for Eric's post!!!!!!!!!!!!

I called and asked a few questions and then proceeded to  make a pickup order to pamper hubs at his request after a long day at work.
I ordered hummus, a falafel pita sandwich, a order of falafel and extra pita. 

While not super yellow inside the falafel like my Israeli InLaws like (yuck) they aren't all green and cheap.
They are just right the way we prefer them.

I tried a few of the items (I eat oil and gluten free) and they really were top notch and kinda tie with Amenia for our favorite falafel pita place here locally. I really like some of the meze sides (there were a lot he gave us). One of the slaw dishes had mayo so I couldn't partake in that one. 

When I picked up his food the guys working there were SUPER nice and added a bunch of candies and items. 

We will be back to visit soon! Hopefully I can get hubs to have a sit down there.

Vegans don't worry, they have zero dairy on premises."}
{"text":"Defiantly best hummus in Vegas!!! Finally a good hummus with fresh hot fava beans. And the pita bread is amazing! I will give them 10 stars if I could. Try Israeli salad with fava beans hummus and that's all need in life!"}
{"text":"The falafel, bright green and so very moist on the inside with deep flavor, light and crispy on the outside. Without a doubt, the best falafel I have had in Vegas.  Likely, the best I have ever eaten.  

I'm sorry to say that the idea of spending $10 on a falafel pita sandwich kept me away for far too long.  Completely worth it.  The sandwich is made in fresh pita, with hummus spread inside with beautiful fresh ingredients and packed full of those amazing falafel.  I also recommend asking for the spicy green sauce, it is a great addition to the pita."}
{"text":"Best kosher restaurant in town! Fresh food and great service . I will definitely be back again and recommend to all my friends.thank you!!!"}

{"text":"Taste of  Israel.... Delicious falafel!!!!! 
This place used to be pizza. But now chumas, falafel, shakshuka, sabich... And salad. No meat no dairy. Parve. New owner."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was great! 
The guys give us every thing we need with a big smile!"}
{"text":"Great food great service . 
If you looking for kosher food 
This is the place to eat.
Go for the pargiot or the schnitzel. 
Very affordable.  
5 star for me"}
{"text":"Great customer service, feels like I'm back in Israel .I asked the guy if he had coffee even though it wasn't on the menu he made sure to get me a coffee just the way I liked it! Best part is it was on the house !thank you for an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing everything they cook is fresh and tasty I really recommend this place"}
{"text":"The best Israeli food experience you can taste in Las Vegas this two brothers have very good heart and professionalism is on top notch."}
{"text":"Delicious falafel pita. Pita was packed with all the goodies to accompany the falafel. Israeli salad was great too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The chicken breast and the rice were INCREDIBLE. They were very helpful as I negotiated the menu. I am a celiac. They said that although they briefly put the veggies that are in the rice in the hot oil, this was fresh oil that hadn't received any wheat products yet. I am glad I went for it. The rice was so delicious. My husband loved his falafel and pita with all the veggies!"}
{"text":"A+ great food, really nice guys. 

They have real toilet paper in the bathroom.
This More than anything else, really shows that the genuinely care about there customers."}
{"text":"Best falafel I've had. Crispy outside, soft inside w good moisture. Hummus has great texture, and the pitas are soft as pillows. Will be repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Just went back for the first time since their renovation. It's so, so different. Everything is new and clean. The guys working there are so insanely nice and attentive I felt like a rock star just showing up. Only one experience so far so take it with a grain of salt. 

I just ordered the hummus and falafel for a quick lunch. If you're eating in, then you're not having a quick lunch if you plan on enjoying yourself. First there were at least nine dishes that come out with your beautifully cooked, hot bread. Israel salad, cabbage, eggplant, three different hot sauces, egg salad (I would fight someone for this egg salad), and red cabbage slaw. Then a huge plate of the best hummus I've ever had, and boatload of falafel. 

I looked up at the gentleman bringing my food, who, like everyone else working there , looked like every svelt soldier I met when I was visiting Haifa, and wanted to say \"You know I'm just one guy here, right?\" 

It's so much food!

That being said, it was empty when I walked in at 12:30. By 1pm the place was packed with people standing in line, and now I know why. Fresh, healthy food with personal service and the real feel of a cafe in Israeli. Just can't be beat. Very happy with the renovations and the addition of meat to the menu. You'll probably see me here at least a few times a week getting a little more content and a lot healthier. 

Just a reminder, the Lucky Dragon casino is right next door if you need to burn off a few calories hanging out with some great casino deals and super drink specials all day long."}
{"text":"I arrived at the restaurant for the first time alone with my wife and I loved the service and the delicious food. The next day we brought friends with children. The food is very tasty and the two brothers Nathaniel and Ben give a great feeling and prepare excellent fresh food. It is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"These people think people are stupid. They rather rip people off a few dollars than to make earnest money and grow their business the right way. The food is great but because of their lack of integrity i have stopped telling people about them. They ripped off my employees who eat there regularly . They have prices posted and charge more. Would not recommend ."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with 5 friends while we were in Vegas for vacation, and they treated us like we were family! On top of that, the food was absolutely incredible. They gave us fries for the table, and as much complimentary salads and sauces as we wanted. Must go, if in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow  5 min in and the table was full with the best food I had in while 
Definitely coming back again 
Best service amazing taste you can't go wrong 
Trust the Chefs with mix salads and mix grill"}
{"text":"The family was in the mood for falafel and the yelp reviews of this establishment were generally all 5* so we gave it a shot. Food and service was so amazing i'm glad that we came! Everybody was so nice and attentive. The falafel was made fresh and delicious. Portion size was good...definitely left feeling full. Entree prices are generally in the $10-14 range. We will definitely come back and we would recommend this restaurant to anybody."}
{"text":"Love the food here. The ambiance is so Middle Eastern indeed. Simple, focus on the food. The way it should be. Best pita bread this side of Nevada. Good portions. Come one. Come all."}
{"text":"The number 1 Kosher restaurant in Vegas!
We came to a conference for a week . And every day we decided as a team to have lunch only in Hummus Vegas."}
{"text":"I just happened on this place. It has the best hummus and the owners are really nice and down to earth. The eggplant and other salads were also great (they also have red and green spicy sauces that are tasty)."}
{"text":"We visited here on the last day of our vacation in Vegas. The food is very tasty and the service perfect and the place is clean and the price is definitely reasonable. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The food at Hummus is off the charts! This kosher hole in the wall makes the best falafel, hummus and kosher burgers in town. Everything is prepared fresh and with care. Worth the premium price you pay."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing number one restaurant in Las Vegas for authentic kosher!!!
I'm addicted to this place and the staff here they're amazing they treat you like gold!!!

Very clean very polite very reasonably priced!!"}
{"text":"New Owners! Israeli brothers that gave up everything in their home town to come to Las Vegas and open a restaurant. You will feel like family and best friends with the super friendly staff. They love to serve and they are very kind. The food is authentic, very fresh, and delicious. A fun kosher restaurant close to the strip that will be around for a long time!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant.The food was great and fresh. The service is amazing and the place is  very clean
I will most definitely recommend Hummus Vegas & Grill to friends and family!"}
{"text":"One of the best food I've ever ate. I love traveling around the world and eating different foods. This place has the right things to make sure you will be back with a big smile"}
{"text":"Best falafel sandwich I have had in vegas. Fresh ingredients, clean atmosphere and friendly service. Be patient they just opened. I didn't experience any service issues. They were very friendly and informative on what they have to offer. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious food, all hand made in front of you.  CLEAN and nice ambiance!  Went for dinner tonight and the line was out the door.  Still got my food in reasonable time and it was fresh and delicious!  5 Star for sure!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant.The food was great and fresh. The service is amazing and the place is  very clean
Thank you guys. It's was my first time there and probably i will go back again. Try the chicken and the kabab"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Reminds me of real authentic Israeli food. Great hospitable service. Thank you"}
{"text":"It's a New place. It's not easy to open a restaurant but they improve 
I see some negative reviews  but no one complaining about the food. And honestly all I care about is the food. I have been to fancy restaurants where service was great but the food not so much. 

The food here is tasty and fresh. Hands down best falafel in Vegas. And probably one of my all time favorites. 
Hummus is creamy and good with the best and softest pittas I ever had in a restaurant.  

Bottom line I like this place and will keep on eating here. The menu selection is not big but any think I order I like. 

Unfurtantle no photos to add since I finished it as soon as it got to my table."}
{"text":"Don't let the sketchy location or bare bones interior scare you. Hummus Vegas is very very good. The owners are super helpful and outgoing. The chef truly understands great flavors and this is a perfect example of Israeli food 101 classics. Ingredients are obviously extremely fresh(they bake their own pita to order). The chicken breast pita, hummus and mergez sausage are superb. Let the owners walk you through the order process."}
{"text":"This place is definitely getting five stars! 

The food is delicious, the staff is awesome and we were so happy to find a nice kosher food around the strip. Loved the hummus and the falafel the most!!! 

Will be back for more soon ;)."}
{"text":"This place feels like it could possibly be straight out of the Middle East, the people (including one man with some body odor to add to the authenticity), upbeat music and warm hospitality added to the experience. The place is clean and well-kept. I ordered the beef kebab pita, great tasting pita with lots of color and flavors to match. My only gripe is that it was expensive for a Pita @ $13.99."}
{"text":"Use these guys for food delivery for my employees.
A couple of pointers 
1) the food is amazing
2) they are always on time 
3) super nice people

If you ever find yourself hungry and craving for some authentic food,
Stop by, call them 

They are 5 stars for sure!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. These guys really know how to run their business. We eat there every time we come to Las Vegas. Great place."}
{"text":"This really not the place you want to order from I'm calling and I pacts an order and there no answer"}
{"text":"Awesome place for Kosher food! It's a meat restaurant. The 2 Brothers that own the restaurant are very friendly!! Lots of food for the money and high quality! They make everything fresh including the pita bread!"}
{"text":"After searching around in Las Vegas I finally discovered veg vegas I've had hummos and fava beans omelette shakshuka it was so delicious I love their bread staff were ok I like the place it's. Nice 
I will alway recommended this place to all my friends this gonna be my spot from. Now on great keep it up guys thanks for everything"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Best falafel I ever tried! The eggplant salad is something special here I have only seen this restaurant make it this way and it's so good! My husband loves their schnitzel with rice. Food comes out fast and takes amazing, highly recommend trying Hummus Vegas if you have not before!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great customer service . All the salads are very yummy and homemade. They make there own pita and baguette... Everything tastes super fresh. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing kosher food. Great friendly staff. I come at least once a week for a falafel pita. The best falafel I have ever had. They convinced me to try another dish recently so I had a schnitzel sandwich which was also so delicious."}
{"text":"I had the perfect experience. I come for vacation from miami and got high recommendations about this place and i have to tell you it was the best food that i eat in my life!!!
The service is very quick and a lot of personal attention. The food its just grate, we got a lot of house salads for starters and pita bread and different kind of meat for entrances. 
I will definitely will come back every time im in town and you have to try it!!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Ego and attitude on top of slow service. Looked at me like I'm a schmendric. I was like \" Wow\"!  Shame it was like that.  At that point the food did not make a difference to me."}
{"text":"I grew up in NJ and spend a lot of time in New York getting quality kosher food.
I can honestly say this place rivals the best of them.
The Falafel is crisp outside and soft and moist inside the way it should be with the proper coloring instead of the brownish grey mess you get in places that don't make it fresh.  The schnitzel pita came on a tasty grilled pita and you get to choose the stuffings from cabbage, tomato, hummus, spicy sauce, tzatziki, onions, and more.  the toppings were fresh.  The sandwich was served with tasty fries and a dish of pickles, peppers and olives.  The flavors were outstanding although I might skip the onions next time in order to get more of the schnitzel flavor.  There are several other options I will try next time.  You can get their food on Pita, Lafa 
 (flatbread) or as a plate.
This place was a gem of a find.
For those who are price conscious, please be aware that Kosher restaurants tend to cost a little more because of the rigorous rules they must follow regarding cleanliness, keeping meat and dairy separate, and what types of meat they order.  My pita with fries cost $14.00.  A plate $19.99 but the portions are filling and the taste was worth it."}
{"text":"That's a new spot for hummus .And so far now it's the best hummus in vegas and very tasty falafel .Defintley will return"}
{"text":"I have had falafel all the way from Los Angeles to Vegas and this place is by far, the best most authentic israeli food ive ever had. Not only was it the best but its also as fresh as it gets! The sides, dips and salads were so delicous!! The guys running the place were really cool and good looking too! I cant wait to go back!"}
