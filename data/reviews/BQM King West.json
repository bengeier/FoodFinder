{"text":"So happy my boyfriend stopped at this place randomly when he saw the burger deal sign.  This is now our go to burger and poutine joint! Great service, amazing burgers ( our favourite is the riverside, which is on sale on Mondays! ) The poutine here is my favourite, the fries, cheese curds and gravy are all fantastic."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Quality hamburgers. Alcohol is decently priced too. Good casual night out."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers and great service... Except that I've twice seen people get harassed by homeless people on the patio and the staff be super chill with it."}
{"text":"Really hit or miss depending on who's at the counter and who's behind the kitchen. I've had incredibly fast service and good food and times, and other times I've had to wait very long for sub par quality.   More recently, I ordered takeout; a Liberty Burger and a side of fries. It usually takes 10-15 minutes but this time it took 40 minutes. Things became noticeably backed up. I believe they ran out of prepped vegetables such as tomatoes part way through the service, and had to run back to get more to cut (even though it was only 6PM). There was visible frustration in the kitchen, with a bowl being tossed, and someone's food being forcibly plopped onto the counter which did not make me feel comfortable.   When I opened my takeout bag, my can of coke was not cold. My burger looked slapped together, and to make things worse, I got half the fries of a normal order, 1/3 of what is usually there  - really disappointing.  If you're ordering takeout, always check your order before leaving."}
{"text":"This place was great I enjoyed the burger so much I couldn't stop myself it was so juicy and gave such great flavor. I love this place"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever for food! Over 30 mins for a burger and fries!!! There were only 3 tables in the entire place. It was dead. I could have forgiven this if it was actually busy.  Huge waste of time for mediocre food. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"I had the slider burgers and they were quite nice. The menu items are a little on the pricey side though considering what they are."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch at BQM King West ... they opened in September.  I've been to BQM Ossington a couple times and had a good meal so I thought I'd try this location today.  I ordered a Riverside burger (with no lettuce) and no fries or salad ... just the burger as I knew it would be enough.  It was a good burger.  The patty had lots of flavour and the bun was soft.  It was really fun and messy.  I'll get it again.  Mike took excellent care of me and was super friendly.  They plan on having a small patio in front in the summer.  No doubt it will be great place to sip some local craft beer when the weather gets warm!"}
{"text":"There people are so friendly, service is awesome, food is great and the drinks are fab! Do I need say more...."}
{"text":"In most cases when I've ordered this for lunch, I've had pretty good burgers that were ready (or just coming off the grill) when I said I would be there to pick it up.  The last time overshadowed that with a terrible raw experience, which makes me question going back there.   I called about 20 mins early to say I will be in at 1pm to pick it up.  The girl said \"oh yeah, it'll definitely be ready by 1.\"  I asked her to assure it won't be sitting around getting soggy, and she sounded aloof but confirmed.  Sure enough, when I brought it back to the lunch room (with 20 mins to eat for lunch) I was so disappointed to see that the bun was sopping with meat juices and the onion rings I ordered were just under luke warm.  I ate some of the burger when I realized that it was very pink and not cooked through.  In my opinion, ground meat should not be left medium rare, for obvious bacterial reasons.  I wasted my lunch regretting this burger and didn't have time to take it back.   I've avoided eating there since because of the server's lack of interest or lack of common sense for timing."}
