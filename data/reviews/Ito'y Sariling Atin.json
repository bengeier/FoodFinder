{"text":"I'm Filipino and one of my personal rules is, \"I don't PAY for Filipino food!\" My Mother and Aunties are amazing cooks! If I'm craving kare-kare or lumpia sariwa or adobo or pancit or pinakbet or anything else Filipino, I pick up the phone and call Mom or I make it myself. But..... Ito'y Sariling Atin has made me have to rethink this rule of mine. I had lunch there with family yesterday and it was so yummy! Lots of dishes from which to choose. I was craving kare-kare that day so that was my main dish. My eyes wanted to order so many things but one's stomach can only hold so much. They re-offer rice if you still have ulam. One gentleman had ordered the halo-halo special. Topped with mango ice cream it was huge and looked amazing! That will be the first thing I order on my next visit there! For 5 adults, the total price was $42; very reasonable. (Thanks for treating, Auntie.) Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Im from Jersey and we have some great Filipino food there...BUT daaang this place is AWESOME. Hands down. A must go place. Great AUTHENTIC Filipino food. Fresh and perfectly seasoned. Clean and very friendly people. Open early! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We didn't enjoy our meal because of loud - mouthed staff. When we asked them to tone it down,  one of them replied that  the restaurant is a public place. How lame is that! !!!.don't come here if you want to have a pleasant meal."}
{"text":"I ate here April 2015. There was some filipino guy monitoring everyone as they ate checking out their plates and ish. When I got up to take a piss, he politely asked me if I needed more rice.  Surprised the sh_t out of me  and I told him I didn't need any. He didn't know I was on a low-carb diet, but good that he was there to address my needs.

I got to the bathroom and noticed there wasn't any toilet paper, so I told the filipino dude there was none. Next thing you know he hustled and restocked the TP with the quickness. Im thinking this guy is on Adderol or something, which is good. I gave him a tip when I left, because I never get that kind of attention in Filipino restaurant. 

The decor of the place is above average for any Filipino restaurant.  Its all about presentation, so don't be afraid to bring your non-filipino friends here."}
{"text":"The food is cold. The beef is chewy. The service is inattentive. One of the worst Filipino restaurants I've ever been to. Go to Goldilocks or Pinoy Pinay instead."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! This is my favorite place to get Filipino food in Las Vegas so far!  Affordable and yummy! I always get a bag pan de sal and of chicharrones on my way out !"}
{"text":"Food is okay some are greasy but still taste good.. What's disappointing is the staff and the service. I don't think they depict the name of their restaurant.. The staff will make you feel unwelcome. My family had a bad experience this week. We came from out of state and wanted to try a good filipino resto. Some of the food are not worth the price like for instance the chicharon which is mainly full of flour and doesn't taste as good as the price..Staff behind the counter is very sarcastic and was very rude! Also the staff at the counter who's giving the food. We asked if they can give some soup and someone from the staff asked \"how many?\" My mom said for 6 people And the guy who's supposed to be giving the soup said to the other staff: \"anim? Eh ano naman kung anim? Ano gusto mong gawin ko?\" I would understand if its just some private jokes between staff members but for them to make us here that comment.. That was kind of rude.. I don't know if we were just sensitive but I don't think that's something that you would let your customers know.. Aside from that, they keep on rushing us to eat faster.. Its just the lunchtime and there we're a lot of extra tables for other customers.. Just poor service I must say.."}
{"text":"$3.99 for garlic rice, 2 eggs, tapsilog, cup of water and coffee. That can't be beat! Great value and quality of food. If this wasn't across the country we would be regulars for sure! Did not have a chance to try and of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Old oil used for fried items, no Bueno !!! Lookout on yesterday's menu coz they will put then out on the buffet."}
{"text":"I was impressed by this place. I had Filipino food for lunch the day before but that was not good and I was looking for something to fill the void. I checked Yelp and found this place rated high by other people. Higher rated than the other place I went to.
If you ever heard someone say to find a good place, find the taxi drivers... this is true! there was about 10 taxi cabs in the parking lot in front of this place.
This is not buffet and went here for breakfast. Found breakfast is $3.99 for any \"silog\" and the amount of food was more than enough. If you are craving anything else, you can order a small size for 3.29 or get there other combo which is not expensive at all.
The server was very polite and social, even though she spoke to me in tagalog and I spoke English back.
The place is nice... its not fine dining, but its not a \"hole in the wall\". it was decently clean and can't complain. the had some good dessert items near the register..even an assorted sipin sipin that I plan to go back for before I leave."}
{"text":"To me customer service is EVERYthing, and with this spot I had the rudest server EVER. As soon as I walked in, the lady behind the counter just stared at me, and didn't even say a word, so I initiated the greetings of a friendly hello. The whole time she was serving me, she had a really annoyed attitude like I was being some annoyance to her. I am local born and cannot speak Tagalog, but I can understand, so I don't know if she thought I was being ma-arts by not speaking Tagalog. Anyways, I started eating my lechon and realized how dry it was, so I had brought it back to the counter and asked for it to be exchanged for something fresher. The whole time this lady was putting the new lechon on my plate, she was saying \"What, u want this?! Here!, and this? Here!!\" I was appalled at what she was doing, but still kept my cool, because I'm not like that. I have class, and apparently she didn't, and thats why she was treating me this way. I sat back down and lost my appetite so I just took my food to go. I don't know about you guys but customer service should be top priority, and in this case, it was not. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I really love this Filipino restaurant. It is affordable and you get more serving most especially take out. I like the taste and I found exactly the restaurant where I can just order and stack them up on my fridge for the rest of the week since I don't know how to cook lol. The busboy is very attentive but needs to smile more often. Place is clean and decent enough."}
{"text":"One of the best Filipino Restaurant in Town! Great Service, and Really Good Food.... love the Tita's Over there there so friendly... and the guy who clean the table and always gives u a great service when you eat there. ..."}
{"text":"Excellent service! The food was awesome specially the Halibut with blackbean sauce was the bomb! There Customer service was beyond my expectations, very friendly and so accomodating. Definitely i will go back again!!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here with a party of 16 flips.....:-). They really took care of us with great food and service!!!! If you love flip food this is the place to go in Vegas."}
{"text":"I would say 3.75 stars. I frequent this place for my \"to go\" lunch plates. They give you a lot of food. The menu is different every day but there are items that you can count on to be in their daily offering. One particular dish that I particularly like is the fried breaded shrimp. They call it camaron rebosado, it is often offered as part of their menu during weekends but you can special order this entree. This is not your typical breaded shrimp with bread crumbs. It is has a fluffier type of breading. It is very good, texture and taste wise. It is accompanied with sweet and sour sauce (Filipino style) and it is best eaten with rice."}
{"text":"Selection wasn't great at 6:30pm (the close at 8pm). Was in the mood for BBQ stick which they didn't have, so i settled for lechon and it tasted good. The lolas working there  were total chismosas and really distracting, way over the top. Food was 3 stars, experience was 0, I'll split the difference and give it a 2 stars overall"}
{"text":"Sooo good! Great price, good portions! This may be my favorite place for hearty meals! Such good hearty food choices, I actually thought this was a mexican restaurant, i'm not disappointed it wasn't. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Very bad service. One of the employee was very rude. It was our first time there. We ended up canceling our order because of the lady's attitude. Never coming back here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the few Filipino places I go for lunch in Las Vegas especially if I am craving for Filipino food. It is like being transported to the PH with its authentic pinoy taste.  Their dinuguan is really great! I also love their sisig, lechon kawali and sinigang na pampano. Their TV is also tuned in to the afternoon long running noontime show, Eat Bulaga! Their staff are all friendly and accommodating. Prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"When I entered this place I was like OH MY!!! I didn't know what to pick. There was a huge selection of everything that I like. I felt like a little kid in a candy store on Christmas day. I was juz blown away from all these delicious looking food. But anyways I will definitely be coming back here the next time I go back to LV."}
{"text":"Lots of selection.  Nice prices.  Great helpings.  Not much in the way of customer service.  It's an adequate hump-day dinner."}
{"text":"What would be my lasting impression of this establishment? In terms of books how about:

\"Lord of the Flies\"

Let's go with music. Since we are in Vegas, how appropriate would this be:

\"Fly me to the moon\"

I think you all know what I'm getting at. I don't want to hear the excuse, \"Since it's an Asian restaurant, it's to be expected..\" Well, no. It's not ok. Please, take care of this. Try to think of your customers safety. Thanks. Now, onto the food:

2 item combo: ordered the lechon and coconut milk chicken. I thought the lechon was pretty good, the skin was crispy and not chewy, the fat was soft and the meat was pretty tender. I thought the coconut chicken broth was pretty good as well. Unfortunately it was loaded with tiny bone shards and fragments. The rice was slightly over cooked but ok. The soup was ok as well.

What's also important to me is the environment I'm eating in. I wish the cleanliness was taken more seriously."}
{"text":"We ate there today 9-22 and asked how much their combo is, the lady server said $5.99  if you get all meat. Fish was  a different price. When I was paying the cashier  she said $6.99 each combo meal I ordered, the employees gave different prices. Also, the meat I ordered tasted nasty with alot of fat. I'm not coming back there at all."}
{"text":"Great service, smiling faces, warm greeting. Had pancit and Halo Halo both were really good! Helpful servers. Open till 8pm."}
{"text":"When I am in the mood(and in the area) for my ethnic food, I like this one. Everything is great. I love the crispy pata. A lot of the food is deep friend and deep fried makes me happy(COMFORT FOOD!). It has been there forever. I just don't care for the area."}
{"text":"Great place love the food they serve!!! Always fresh when I go there!! Has 2 TV that plays the current TFC show..Nilaga is always the bomb!! And the Turon always sweet"}
{"text":"We usually go to Max's but they closed down so we tried this place out. The food was okay. But what made it worse is that they don't have an air conditioning. You're sweating while you're eating. And on top of that,  the workers are very rude plus they try to overcharge you!!!!!!!! Make sure you check your receipt!! Better yet, DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE!!!!! I REPEAT, DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE,  SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY SOME PLACE ELSE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went by after work, they were nice and pleasant to work with.  Food was great my wife that really isn't into Filipino food but she loved the BBQ and the pancit.  I really wanted sinagang pork that is why 4 not a 5 star..  Will go back again and again."}
{"text":"If you guys are looking for a freshly cooked filipino dish that is within a budget come to this place. Service is excellent and the place is very clean"}
{"text":"First off location...not a good area...My wife is Filipina and we eat a lot of filipino food. My favorite is chicken adobo and this selection here was not good. How can a dish made with garlic and vinegar not taste like it had vinegar in it?..Also the overall selection was not good...Don't know how anyone could see this place having a large variety to choose from. My wive had oxtail that looked good but was so over cooked we took to go as we didn't want to throw it away in front of them:). Place was not clean either...Blinds broken and hanging sideways on window and sun shining on windows as u enter show the windows filthy. This is rather a brutal review I know but it is what we experienced. But give it a try and see what u think."}
{"text":"Food is cheap.  Service was great. Usual fare of pinoy favorites.  I will go here again if we get craving for pinoy food.  Get 2 item combo for a buck more"}
{"text":"Food was okay. 
Staff were not friendly especially the guy from the kitchen. We ordered a small tray of rice and when he gave it to us he just threw it on the counter instead of placing it there nicely. 
Some customers were  mean. Try Tina's Filipino Cuisine it's super good!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually on this side of town very often...or at all if you observe my trends.

Was here due to the Anime convention over at LVH. After a few hours the hunger set in and walking around LVH my group and i started to notice that choices were quite sparse for lunch options. Hell the diner was closed and they shoveled people next door to the cantina for over priced happy hour. Other than that there was a pizza hut.

So i suggested Hot Dog Haus and the group agreed. Drove over and would you believe it...out of business (scene from Return of the Sith where Vader goes 'NOOOOO' and destroys everything in the room). Buddies suggested Ito'y Sariling Atin so i was like sure.

Long story short I can not for the life of me pronounce the name of this place or tell you what i ate other then describe it as a beef stew with rice dish but holy hell this place was the greatest bang for the buck and had some AWESOME food.

Pictures i'll be sure to take pictures of what i eat here in the future and you guys can help me put a name to it."}
{"text":"Yummy filipino food and great service...  My family was treated like VIPs here because the cab driver who took us there told them we were with them.  The soup that comes along with our meal was really good.  I had the kare kare and it tasted just like the way my grandma makes it.  The turon (banana egg roll) was really good... it was crispy and not soggy.  We loved it so much that we went back 2 days later for breakfast.  The longsilog was okay.  The garlic rice was a little cold but the longonisa (filipino sausage) was yummy and not too greasy.  I would definitely go back again the next time we visit Sin City.  It's a nice change from eating on the strip."}
{"text":"This place is heaven! Wide selection of filipino foods to choose from and the menu is your momma's home-cooked meal.Great food,good price.Plus the staff are awesome! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Didn't go there for the hot food, just there for the chicken Chicharrón.  Instead of deep fried pork rinds, we deep fry chicken skin.  Everybody knows the best part of Popeye's chicken is the skins.  At this establishment, it's like having your cake and eating it too.  It's like a childhood dream of eating pizza with 5 layers of cheese, like Pork Fried Rice with MSG, like an Open bar, really, anything that would cause a life threatening illness if overindulged.  It's that exciting.  All the goodness of something really bad for you.

Well, the review isn't quite complete until I try the entree, but since I did eat their food, I'll give it 3 stars.  Great with rice and vinegar."}
{"text":"Took my aunt and uncle here, every time they are in town they wish to visit this restaurant. We are never disappointed. Always wonderful to have some good Filipino food, makes me miss my own moms cooking. 

Only negative, they didn't have adobo. Adobo is a traditional Filipino meal so was a little shocked they didn't have it. On the flip side they did have fried pusit, which I never see at any Filipino restaurant so that was a great surprise."}
{"text":"We ate at this place on Friday May 28th.
The place looked fine as we walked in. Not being familiar with this restaurant, our curiosity led us to ask questions about what the different types of dishes that were on the steaming table. The old hags behind the counter were not friendly with their answers. The ugly hags were making comments to each other each time we would ask a question. My daughter ordered the shu-mai. They place her shu-mai on a plate and preceded to microwave it. Each of our order were followed by \"this is delicious\", by the ugly old hag servers.
As we went to the cashier to pay for our food, the cashier tried to sell us drinks, cookies and various desserts. When we sat down the bus boy asked us if we wanted dessert. They were constantly trying to sell us extra items. As we started on our meal all four of us noticed that the food was luke warm. I would think that food should be at least warm to hot or cold as to avoid bacteria. The food was not palatable . The rice was somewhat dry. 
Ugly old cackling hags coupled with poor tasting cold food warrants a -1 star.
We should have ate at grill city where the food is hot and tasty and the staff super friendly.
Fooled by The reviews left for this place. Don't waste your money on this place. Go to Grill City instead."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch after getting my fingerprints done next door. I got the 2 choice plate lunch with kare kare and laing. I thought the kare kare was pretty bland and the peanut sauce was watery. No flavor really....The laing was ok but I've tasted better at DJs about 30 steps away in the same plaza. I can't really review this place based on one plate lunch dish alone so I will try some other choices and will update..."}
{"text":"First impression: This place is terrible.

First of all let me give you a quick background on me. I am half filipino (from my dad)so I have SOME knowledge about filipino food. The problem is I am also half white and extremely extremely americanized lol. That being said I know the basics of filipino food only from eating at my grandmas house (yummmmmm). However, I cant prononuce anything in tagalog. No accent. By looking at me you cant even tell I am half so obviously coming in they think I'm just some straight up white girl walking into their restaurant. 

When I walked up to order thats when I realized how rude the lady was. She was completely irritated that I was pointing at certain dishes asking what type of meat it is (i can only point out  loganisa, adobo, annddd sinigang). Other than that I  have nooooo idea. She had an attitude problem and all I wanted was some good food. 

So this makes me wonder..... do all customers have to have an accent and know the ins and outs of this type of food to come here???? In order to give good service do I have to bring my grandma along. 

Its not like the lady didnt speak english or didnt understand me. She was just mad that I didnt know what was what. 

Ruuuuuuude!!!!!!!

I would say I would never come back but the only reason this place gets 2 stars is because their halo halo is bomb! I'll come back for that since I know how to say it lol

Anyways food was mediocre, Or maybe my granny spoils me. It was a big bowl of oil -_____-"}
{"text":"Definitely a good place to go if you're craving Filipino food!

I ate here Monday for lunch and I had the pork menudo and pinakbet! Soooo good! They have huge variety of filipino dishes from fried bangus, pancit, afritadas and even chicharon and leche flan! 

I'm going back toVegas tomorrow and I will visit this place for desserts! Maybe I'll get halo halo and leche flan."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this spacious and homey Filipino restaurant by my parents on our recent visit to Vegas.  This was by all means the best place on the Mainland for authentic, home-cooked Filipino food.  The cafeteria -style set up let's you choose from the wide variety of entrees.   We went twice because you can't beat the $3.99 2-item combo, served with a ton of steamed white rice (of course), and a cup of soup (more like a flavorful broth).  I tried adobo, pinakbet, fried pusit, kare kare, BBQ pork on a stick, sinigang, and a couple of fish dishes my mama ordered.  Oh, yeah....masarap!  

The staff are wonderful, and with TFC on the tube, you'll feel like you're at your Auntie's house for lunch."}
{"text":"When i was in vegas recently, i ate here twice. And the only time come back to a place to eat twice is if their food is really good. Lots of selection and ambience is homey- feels like you're back home in the Philippines. The prices are reasonable too. I will definitely eat here again if i am in the area."}
{"text":"Affordable place to eat.... Good food, lengua or beef tongue was tender and tasty... Pork adobo had too much fat. Good place to try on occasion... Can't eat here daily or my cholesterol and Utica acid goes through the roof .... Lol"}
{"text":"Went on a trip to Vegas recently, thought we'd stop by to save some money by going to purchase food from here, myself and friends had a real craving for Filipino food since we were completely over the international style buffet we had all been to that week. Food was decent. Prices were slightly too high for the quality and quantity of the dishes. 
 
We ordered 2 rice trays to go boxes of steamed rice. And no it's the Togo boxes your thinking of, the 7x7 box. It was. 3x5 box. Each box was $3.50. I thought that was kinda pricey. Next we got kare kare in a medium container 5.99, and secondly we got caldereta also in medium 5.99. The sizes of the containers looked so small. Like I mentioned earlier portions were small for the price. 

But blehh,food was okay. Nothing screamed ouuuu I have to come back for this.

Worst of all, the overall experience was just ehh. The ladies behind the counter were just  rude. Simple questions were easily not answered, and right before we left we asked for 4 sets of utensils for the food we just purchased and the response of one of the ladies is \" we don't give utensils\", and I said I just saw the lady rolling up utensils in the napkin. She replies that's only for the people who buy combo! Holy crap seriously it's not like we didn't buy any of your overpriced food already. It wasn't till we left I saw Thai bbq, I would of so went there instead -_-"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a  try after a disappointing lunch at the bibingkahan place. This place definitely outshines the other in a lot of ways.
The food tastes way much better. SEasoned right !!!
SErvice is friendly and people who works there are nice.
Would make this place my go to for Filipino dishes.
They also got some Filipino snacks for sale."}
{"text":"I'll be upfront and say I'm not Filipino but I know Filipino food.  My best friend growing up was Filipino and his mom was a spectacular cook and I ate 3-5 meals a week there.  First of all,  the selection is a lot smaller than DJ's.  I've read other reviews raving about their selection, I failed to see it.  I had the beef machado and a pork dish.  They didn't have bistek, palobok, and what they had as punsit looked pretty sad.  I personally found the selection at DJ's (in the same shopping center) has a better selection and their food is on point with this one."}
{"text":"We were craving for a \"lutong bahay\" (home cooking), and we decided to try this place. It definitely hit the spot.  The vegetables are fresh, and the fish in the sinigang was tasty!

I was a little surprised that lunch food was ready at 8:30 AM. We had an early flight arrival in LAS and we were really just looking for breakfast.

However, it turned out to be an awesome brunch."}
{"text":"Let's start off by mentioning why the minus 1 star.

People who are not Filipino will always be like \"How the hell do you say the name of the store?\", or \"WTF?!\"

Also this place is a bit more expensive then the competing Filipino restaurants around this area.

On to the good things, this is a great place to bring someone new to Filipino food. This place is the cleanest compared to the \"other\" Filipino restaurants neighboring the area. Also they really make the food very presentable. We do eat with our eyes first, and I will admit as a Filipino our dishes really don't LOOK that appetizing. It's like Indian food, they don't look appetizing a lot of times, but really is very good.

The staff is very friendly, but that is expected since it is staffed by Filipinos. 

If you are craving Filipino food check this place out."}
{"text":"OMG!!! I love this place! I ate everything in one sitting!!! It was so good.  My best friend is Filipino and I love her moms cooking but I'm sorry, but hands down I will eat at this place everyday!  I will go to Vegas just eat here.  I don't know what I got but it was very delicious and I loved the ube dessert."}
{"text":"i love filipino food... however, i \"love\" it only when it comes to my family's cooking.  i'm biased, i know.  every time i eat dishes others have made, i have a tendency to compare it to my family's.  there are only a limited number of ones who come up to snuff.  anywho, this place has just been added to my list.  the food here tastes good.  i visited this restaurant both times i was in vegas.  first visit - we walked in and each were given a cup of hot soup.  there were so many choices of food and all looked so appetizing.  i decided on the bistek and bbq pork on a stick.  those entrees with the rice and a glass of mango juice certainly satisfied me.

i revisited the restaurant 3 days in a row during my second trip.  i'm giving it 5 stars for the consistency in the good quality food that they served.  i tried the dinuguan, which was alright, and the pork apritada, which i really really liked.  i was excited to find out that they have 2 other restaurants, both of which are located in socal.  hopefully the food at the other restaurants taste just as yummy.  if not, then i'm gonna have to plan another trip to vegas.  =)"}
{"text":"Good Filipino food, so many delicious food to choose, and you won't be disappointed. I got nilaga and fried salmon bellies, and my SO got lechon.  They give generous portions. Very nice and friendly service."}
{"text":"I'm amazed that there are so many Filipino restaurants in Las Vegas. I always visit this place to escape the \"Strip\" and give my wallet a rest. 

I have been going back and forth about rating this place 3 or 4 stars. I have settled on 4 stars since 3 1/2 stars is not an option. By comparison, this place puts all of the Phoenix area Filipino places to shame. They have a wide selection of choices and the prices are reasonable. My review is based on the American palette as opposed to the Filipino palette.

Their breakfast menu consists of rice, longanisa, and eggs. I'm not really a fan of the breakfast so I nosh on the Turon. Which is a fried banana with jack fruit rolled up to look like a 8-12 inch eggroll.  The Turon is excellent and I always buy a bunch to go. These are $1 each and easily my favorite Breakfast item.

The lunch and dinner options are abundant. I have had the Lechon Kawali, Adobo and Caldaretta. I thought these dishes were OK, nothing to really salivate over."}
{"text":"Good place to go if you're looking for Filipino food.  All the dishes that I ordered tasted like the ones from home or at Filipino parties.  Safe place to try if you want to try something different than chow king, jollibees, or goldilocks!"}
{"text":"staff are great 
serving portion is ok
food is a bit on the bland and dry side
went there around noon before going home for a 4 hr trip, they still have breakfast foo. so i got longanisa,fried rice and pusit
rice is too dry and pusit is clumpy but finish them all as im too hungry to complain
maybe next time we visit las vegas, ill give it another try"}
{"text":"Best filipino fast food I've eaten in Vegas.
Buffet style setup where you see the food that's already cooked and ready to be served. Customer service is good with a busboy who is very friendly & always cleaning. 

The biggest downfall is that filipino food is that it's not that healthy for you. Eat responsibly lol

Try the Tocino, Fried Pork & anything that they serve. It's as filipino tasting as it gets!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed eating here. It's turo turo style and the portions are sumptuous. We were also offered a second helping of rice with no charge. What we couldn't eat we took home with us."}
{"text":"I love Filipino food, and this place has just that.  If you're craving adobo or banana lumpia, stop here and grab a plate to go."}
{"text":"Came in early. Food was fresh and it felt like home. I've had some very bad experience with Filipino restaurants in the past, but this one is an exception. I love this restaurant. Even my boyfriend liked it, and he's typically not fond of Filipino food."}
{"text":"Not bad for three people to be roughly $30 dollars. Had the milk fish, mongo beans, bittermelon, and coconut juice. This place is very welcoming with bright walls and warm greetings from the person behind the buffet table. Not really a great place for vegetarians due to majority of the dishes to be meat based. Our busser was kind to let us know if we needed more rice towards the middle of our meal. Salamat!"}
{"text":"Never tried their food. Might be really good but read along for the 1star review.

Came here after a long walk on the strip. We called in and asked what time they close. Also checked yelp for good measure. Then when we walked in, the employees were literally closing the place. Few food was still outside but they were scrubbing soap and cleaners on the counter.

As soon as I said \"hi\". The other lady said \"just take out now\". And I was shocked, we still have 45 minutes to eat right? Wrong. And other of the employees said \" you can eat outside if you want\". WHAT? They want us to eat outside when it's literally 40 degrees outside. There are snows in the mountain tops of the nearest mountains in vegas!! And lastly just to put the experience over the top. The other lady jokingly said \" unless you will pay us overtime sir?\"... yeap. That just happened.

For a Filipino place that caters for our culture they have negative way of trying to make you \"feel at home\". This place might have good food. But they get zero manners. Not a way to represent the Filipino culture. 

Hope no one ever experience the same thing. And I hope the owner checks the attitude of his workers. If If I own a business, I won't kick people out that way. I will make sure never to come back to this place, and make sure the people I know don't check this out either."}
{"text":"The food here is so fresh and delicious. The people who work here are so nice and inviting. I was walking in the the restaurant and an employee opened the door and greeted me. Everyone here is so kind and the food was so amazing. It is the best Filipino restaurant I've ever been to. It definitely earns my five star rating. Thank you for the great experience :)"}
{"text":"This place is the only Filipino restaurant in Vegas worth going to.  Food is always fresh and dont forget to get the fresh melon juice.  Only only beef I have is that the sinigang soup is not pork but fish, which is nastay."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff . Variety of menu from meats to veggies. They have a well rounded and clean dining area."}
{"text":"The Silverfish is amazing.  Great basic Filipino food with all the sweets and bakery items to go with it!"}
{"text":"Since i came in to vegas this has been always my favorite filipino restaurant.!  The staffs were all nice and approachable, the food always looks fresh, and the place is always clean compare to the other long time filipino restaurants in town. My favorite from there is bicol express, beef steak, kare-kare, and bopis. Don't forget to ask for complimentary sinigang or nilaga soupon the side. One of the best thing about them is if you eat at the restaurant itself they offer unlimited RICE! Wow! They do catering too. They close early on sundays, and 8pm the rest of the days."}
{"text":"The selection of food is so-so here, but that's most likely because I'm a picky eater when it comes to Filipino food. Basically, I came here because I wanted to see if their dinuguan could beat DJ Bibingkahan's. Long story short, it doesn't.

One of the good things about this place would be their TFC on a flat screen that the other patrons were enjoying. Other Yelpers might find this cool, which is why I mention it. One thing that really stood out for me was their Sago Gulaman. Now theirs is the best Sago Gulaman I've ever had, & I've tried almost everyone's: Max's Chicken, Goldilocks, Kambinggan in Waipahu, etc. Their Sago Gulaman is the only reason that I'll ever come back here. Unfortunately, they serve it in a small cup for $2.18 each (after tax).

The reason why I deducted two stars is not only because of their mediocre selection of food, it is also because they have an employee, the male busboy in his 40s I believe, who would not stop staring at me the whole time I was there; it creeped me out so much that I almost got up & left a couple times. Finally when he had gone in the back, I ordered another drink & hit the road."}
{"text":"Excellent crispy pata. Price is very reasonable and the service is great. Filipino hospitality is very apparent."}
{"text":"First time here and we were greeted with a warm welcome as if it was my aunt talking to me. The food was really delicious if I had a big stomach I would  want to try everything. The food taste like it should (home cooked) The decor has a home vibe feel very festive I should have taken a photo but I was to hungry to lol Everyone was friendly and the bus man was sweet too."}
{"text":"Ito'y Sariling Atin is a decent Filipino restaurant. They have a good selection of food which always looks appetizing, but I've only dined here once in the past since I enjoy dining at my ma's kitchen instead. I can say that I like their fried bangus, and when it comes to  bangus, I usually have to use a fork to prevent people from immediately attacking the bangus' fatty center upon being placed on the table.  But what I really enjoy eating from here is the Lechon Baboy.

My family has ordered Lechon Baboy from here several times in the past. Although I'm Filipina, I'm not a big pork eater (this is a SIN, and I'll most likely be going to hell for this and for only eating rice on occasion), but I cannot resist Porky Pig's crispy skin and succulent meat. If I'm not mistaken, you can also select the size of pig you want. I'm unsure as to what the sizes are, but we always order one that's a little bigger than my dog, who's an adult male American Cocker Spaniel. Whatever size you order, I'm sure it'll all be gone before your party's over, especially if it's a Filipino party."}
{"text":"Great place. Open early so I can actually come before work too have a great breakfast. Sometimes there may be a little language barrier but not any different from most Mexican restaurants.  Great people and great food. Bbq sticks always on point though!!!! And tapa is delicious."}
{"text":"For the times my stomach craves for the goood ol' country Filipino food my tongue have grown accustomed to besides the other international cookings my mother, my father and/or our housekeeper cooks for me and my siblings way back then; For the times I would just not get busy in the kitchen making favorite Filipino cuisine, this is my dining home when in Vegas. Why? can not think of anything else nor compare it with other places but it just fills and completes my Filipino food palate's needs! 

Pluses: 
This is a  family-friendly, laid-back, fast-food type restaurant. Want to see the interior? see the restaurant's own video on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ9ahwcj5mw&feature=mfu_in_order&list=UL 
The atmosphere is cordial and conducive to just eating. Sometimes it's filled with diners on peak dining hours and sometimes I dine in with only 2 or three tables occupied. I like that, too, so I can concentrate on my meal and savor it without rushing out (so others can seat and eat on the table I just vacated, so unlike other restaurants). 
There's televisions to watch Filipino programmed shows or sometimes sports is on the monitor. If not, just eat!
It's not hot or cold inside. Guess, it has an A/C and fans swirl around, above from ceiling. Well, I feel comfy while dining, not un-climated.
I have dined in the restaurant when \"Pork Binagoongan\" was on the buffet line (see photos). Other favorites of mine like \"Laing\", \"Pinakbet\", \"Sinigang\", \"Kare-kare\", \"Bicol Express\", \"Ginataan\" are waiting to be had. Well, I stop the enumeration right there because I have many favorites. It could get on and on, including soups and desserts...that said, it would take up so much space here on this page. Any favorites you can think of? Many Filipino food favorites are presented for you to have, to taste. A variety each day. Not the same served on the buffet line everyday. Isn't that exciting? Each time you visit, it ain't the same foods for the day. 
Finely sliced, scrumptious, well-seasoned and deliciously spiced up meals. 
They serve breakfast food. Though my regular choices were simple, my breakfast meal is always delightful of Garlic Fried Rice, a double nice sunny-side up eggs and delectable \"Longanisa\" (sweet and spicy sausage). 
An array of finger food delicacies and packaged candies or mini-desserts for your sweet fixing need. 
For just less than $10, a generous choice of 2 entrees in a combination with a heaping, steaming white rice and a small side of soup is a good deal. There are times I get a really good appetite, an extra serving of rice is given free of charge.
The buffet line staff are friendly, helpful, and cordial. And they serve with an attentive smile. Although the staff is Filipino speaking, English as you all know by now is spoken by most Filipinos.
Food is made fresh daily, hot, and straight from the kitchen.
A \"to-go\" styrofoam box and plastic bag is given when taking home the rest of the meal is an option.
There's a bathroom to wash my hands or peruse it for other purpose, you know what I mean.
Parking space is abundant outside the restaurant. Choose your space.

Un-Plus, but See the Good Side Of It: 
No wait staff if you are looking for someone to attend to you while you eat. It is a fast food restaurant. What did you expect? A tip is not even expected, unless you were really served by one of the staff. 
Just don't expect the same Filipino foods made for each day. The buffet line offers you delectable choices that varies each day. 
Later in the course of the day, the buffet trays are replenished; nevertheless, it's made fresh each time.

Back to Plus: The tables are attended to after the diner(s) leave the table by a cordial cleaning attendant resulting in a nice clean table if the diners before you do not clean up after themselves, you know how some people are.

Overall, I enjoy my meals and \"masarap talaga\" (that means, really tastes good!) Mmmmm! Mmmm! Mmm!

{"text":"Great Filipino food with variety of choices at a very reasonable price, friendly staff. We always eat there whenever we're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Good was so fresh and great best buffet Filipino food I've had living in Vegas 15 yrs . Loved it!"}
{"text":"HUGE selection of food (two counters of food so at least 20-30 different items) and friendly staff. 

My girlfriend and I came in and only i was ordering food, but she gave both of us a cup of soup. I ordered the Chicken Afritada and Laing. She piled on way more food that would be expected from an average two item plate. The entire meal was about $6 and its around $7 for a 3 item plate. Both were perfectly seasoned and the chicken was juicy and tender. 

The place is CLEAN and brightly colored. 

I know that anytime i have a craving I will come back here."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with $5.99 two item combo for lunch!

The disadvantage of having a high metabolism is I get hungry every 2 seconds and going to a sit-down restaurant and waiting 10-15min becomes a matter of life and death. So, my friend dragged me here to prevent me from falling over due to low blood sugar. 

There was about 20 items on display to pick from, all combos come with white rice, or you can substitute for fried noodles for $1 more. I got the curry beef and the pork tongue dish; both were unique in flavor and very authentic. My friend who is Philipino tells me that her mother likes this place and calls it old-school. 

I got my food and start inhaling right away and immediately felt better. 
P.S. no bathroom comments here, since I was too busy eating and didn't even remeber to go use the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Simple buy well executed and varied buffet of Filipino family cooking... Always enjoy this!"}
{"text":"Ito'y Sariling Atin is loosely translated as \"this is our own.\" They really make the food here their own because it's traditional Filipino home style cuisine. They have a pretty good selection here, and they seem to have everything together... I really like this place because their food makes me nostalgic of my mom's cooking. Of course nothing ever beats what your family makes, but what they have here should suffice!

The interior is quaint, clean, and well-maintained. They definitely have the home-y feel to the place... It's easy to order here, you literally tell them what you want and they make the plate for you. I got the chicken afritada and the lechon kawali.

The chicken afritada was close to how my family makes it when they have potlucks. The chicken was tender and flavorful. You can't go wrong with the sauce from the afritada mixed with your rice!

The lechon kawali wasn't as good as the afritada, though. It was hard to the touch, and a lot of the pieces made it feel like I was chewing on rubber. I think that's forgivable because everything else was pretty great. Honestly, lechon is a hit or miss at some places and I guess they missed the mark here this time.

This isn't a fancy gourmet restaurant, but it is a place to get some decent Filipino dishes. I would come back to see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"I recently ordered Lechon here, needless to say Lechon naleche... This is the first time ive cut into a Lechon and the whole bottom of the pig was gone, I saw nothing but the bottom foil tray. For advertising the best Lechon, not even close. If I have the oven or pit, I'd do it myself. They said its teally like that because its oven cooked, they could've just sliced it open but take the whole portion of the chest all the way thru the belly is wrong. You buy a whole pig you lose 1/4 of the pig is just a robbery. Never again will I buy anything from this place....."}
{"text":"I normally coming here but OH MY GAH! IT'S SUMMERTIME the air-conditioning doesn't work! Muggy hot sweaty flies the list goes on an on!
The man that gives you napkins takes care of the trash then touches napkins with FILTHY DIRTY GARBAGE WET RAG INFESTED hands on everything talk about so unsanitary too the max! What the hell is happening to this place it's getting worst every time I come in. 
Please spend money on your business keep it clean wash your hands or get some disposable gloves for G SAKES. An the air-conditioning it's 1Million degrees outside coming in with hot food makes it hotter! Loosen the purse strings we spend so much of our money on your food we EXPECT NO..NOOO.. WE DESERVE BETTER! DISAPPOINTING!"}
{"text":"I like the turo turo style restaurant. Food was great. My kids love it.  Restaurant set up was like typical carenderia set up."}
{"text":"\"Wait, you came all the way to Las Vegas to eat Filipino food?!?\" - friend

Despite all the buffets and cheap eats, I guess my family needed to find some home food.  This place is great!  A little over priced (about the price you pay at Goldilocks) but it's worth it.  A 3-entree rice plate set me back around $7 and for my first and only visit here, I had the Chicken BBQ, Chicken Adobo, and Chicken Afretada.  Normally when I eat another Filipino's cooking, I think to myself \"wow this is inferior to my mom's cooking\" but quite honestly, this place measures up!

One of the workers there even offered to give us more rice and sinigang broth while we were eating, which was really nice of them.

I'll be coming back here with my family on our next visit to Vegas, whenever that may be of course, LOL."}
{"text":"Love this place. Right when you come through the door youre greeted by the servers. The filipino ladies who work here are really nice & sweet. The bus boy is hella helpful & always ready to clean your table of finished plates and what not. The food is really good and tastes like homemade authentic filipino. solid."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this Filipino restaurant. Their okoy is delicious. Usually served on Mondays, I would recommend calling in before going in if you'd like to see if they will be serving the particular dish you want. Their kare kare is bomb they give plenty of bagoong, they're good at filling up your plate with food. Some of the food you will see here are usually; soup (sinigang), lechon, menudo, okoy, kare kare, barbeque, tilapia, vegetables, turon, halo halo,ube, ube filled bread, pan de sal, biscuits, cantaloupe juice, and Filipino sodas (sarsi, orange soda). 

I order for here and to go. The prices are reasonable and well worth it. It is very similar to a pinoy pinay or DJ bibingkahan, where the food is already made and kept warm. The staff keeps the tables and the restaurant clean. The bathroom is also clean. There are booths and tables for customers to sit. There is always plenty of room to eat here. I have not seen it crowded before, you won't have trouble finding a seat. There is usually plenty of parking as well."}
{"text":"It is a turo-turo place. price is reasonable just like in the bay area. they have 1 or 2 item special or you can order a-la carte .we were 6 people so we tasted most of the food they have. the veggies in the pinakbet were crunchy, cooked just right. each of the menu was tasty. lots of selection of Filipino desserts. friendly people. has 2 T.V. in tagalog channels - so u can watch your favorite show. this place maybe walkable if you are staying at LVH."}
{"text":"My familys favorite filipino restaurant in vegas! I eat so much whenever I go here.  They give free soup & A LOT of rice! They have my favorite banana dessert thing called Maruya! I can never find a place here in LA where they serve that :(.  They have a wide selection of filipino food to choose from... from bbq to adobo to menudo and ampalaya.  All the food I've tried is pretty good.  

Parking is really easy since they're located in a plaza, and the workers are always so friendly!"}
{"text":"Best Filipino eatery restaurant place near downtown Las Vegas. The place is clean and food is fresh and staff is friendly. Check out this place and try good Filipino food in Lad Vegas."}
{"text":"Came in on our way to the airport to get some deep fried chicken skin and my gf couldn't resist trying their halo halo. She liked the halo halo, chicken skin not so much.

Place was pretty busy and the food looked good, maybe next trip we'll try it out."}
{"text":"Out of the large amount of Filipino restaurants in Vegas, Sariling Atin's food is just THE best. I've tried a few others, but hands down, this one's my favorite.

Don't get me wrong.. I love my parents' cooking, but I think even they would admit their food is delicious. In a one week stay, I think we managed to buy food from them like 4 out of the 7 days. Everything I've tried there is just full of flavor. I've never thought anything was too salty or lacking in something.

Cost-wise, I think it costs around $10 or a little for a large sized container of ulam (\"dish\" in Tagalog.. basically one of the items). They also serve one or two item combos with rice, and they come with soup too (usually nilaga or sinigang). They also sell homemade desserts, sago't gulaman, melon, Sarsi soda, etc.

Sariling Atin is where it's at!"}
{"text":"I went here 3 days in a row lol. It's affordable and delicious. The staff is very accommodating"}
{"text":"On our way to a weekend Vegas trip the hunger pangs starts rollin' and yes being we are craving for something more traditional Filipino offerings \"Ito'y sariling atin\" truly delivered. The selection of dishes are quite extensive and looks pretty darn good, a two entree combo will definitely keep those hunger pangs at bay for several hours as this is the place do serve their food quite generously. 

I like their adobo and also their fried milkfish\"daing na bangus\" as someone who grew up eating this delectable goodies, I could say that their fish dish was freshly cooked, nice hot and crunchy! Their adobo was nicely seasoned not overwhelmingly vinegary.

The staff are very courteous and friendly, the place was well tended and clean. I like this place a lot and will surely come back.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is clean!! The friendliest staff I ever met. Best halo halo in vegas! The ube ice cream on top is so huge!! Their Turon is long and fat!! If ur into that..they're food looks really good.. But I just had lunch somewhere else boo.. It's 90 degree outside and I'm freezing inside!! Wohhoo!!"}
{"text":"Low price ($7 for a combo), but food is so so. We ordered some pork stew, beef stew, BBQ pork, crispy shrimp and fried bean sprout. In general, the meat are very tough, except the pork, fried items are staled and not crispy. Server is very friendly and helpful. Food is tasty. I specific enjoyed the sour soup that is pork stocking based."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE. 

My family and I used to enjoy eating at Ito'y Sariling Atin when I was younger. But we've noticed that the quality of the food has plummeted. My mother ordered food from here for Noche Buena (Christmas Eve celebration). The beef steak was not good, and the palabok didn't taste like how it was supposed to.. It tasted old and stale. I got very bad food poisoning a few days after eating the food. It lasted for a week, and went away on its own. My boyfriend who also had dinner with us on Christmas Eve got food poisoning as well, but his sickness has lasted UP TIL NOW (ALMOST 2 MONTHS!!!!). He has been extremely sick and recently found out he has SALMONELLA POISONING. I had it, and it went away on its own, but his was worse. DO NOT GO. DON'T EAT TAINTED FOOD."}
{"text":"The server mostly sometimes are nice, I love the food I'm not going to lie about it but it's kinda crowded."}
{"text":"From reading all the \"good\" reviews about this place we decided to check it out. The food here was Decent. Nothing great about it. Portion sizes were small. It was also located in the ghetto. Would we go back there? No."}
{"text":"We drove for 8 hours and didn't want to eat regular gas food so we decided to give this place a try. It did not disappoint. They have a big selection and friendly and very helpful staff. We ordered the fish sinigang and received one giant fish, chicken tinola, lechon kawaii and calderetta baka. They all tasted fresh and close to what my dad and grandma would used to prepare for us. Husband and kids ate it all. I did order the halo halo and it was quite large with three scoops of ube ice cream. It was around 5 and started to get really busy."}
{"text":"I''ve been to the ones in Cali, hoping that this was just as friendly and satisfying. 

Definitely out of two times eating there and a few other cafeteria spots, this is probably the better of what I've tried in the area. I haven't tried any sit down filipino spots, but I think that should deserve a separate category.  Food is nicely seasoned and not too greasy or skimpy on the meats and didnt have a gross amount of meat to fat ratio (this coming from someone who LOVES fat...sometimes its just too much at some joints) . The people who work here are very friendly too. 

This though is great because many of these dishes take so long and I normally dont want to cook it.  I particularly don't live \"very filipino\"- I dont have TFC at home, or cook/eat out filipino often or have much flip friends to talk Tagalog with. It's just kinda nice sometimes to be with my people and eat a variety of things from my heritage and watch Woowoowee on the TV. Of course I miss my moms cooking (she is the best cook out of her 13 siblings clan), but going to someplace to eat dishes kinda gives a little bit of that home comfort.  It's small things, but means something....I don't ever want to lose that part of myself that is Filipino."}
{"text":"I went here randomly one day, and felt like I was home when I left! Ahh I got Lechon Kawali, Chicken Afretada, Sinigang, Turon, and Sago! All for less than $10! They were so friendly... they made me fresh Lechon! I sat and ate it, reminiscing about my grandmother's cooking! It is a busy place and you can get some good pandesal and desserts there to go as well!"}
{"text":"Made a huge order to go here and they did not accommodate with any plates or utensils. Very weird and very cheap. They actually told us to go to the dollar store to buy our own plates. I don't know the cost of their Styrofoam plates but apparently it's too expensive to give out to paying customers."}
{"text":"This is a typical style Filipino restaurant here in Las Vegas.  The food was okay, nothing really stood out.  The price is very reasonable, which is good if you are eating on a budget."}
{"text":"I went here for an early morning breakfast during a visit to Las Vegas and was very satisfied.  It's nothing fancy but when the clientele is primarily the local Filipino population, then they must be doing something right.  My garlic rice, pork and fried egg were delicious. I look forward to returning so I can sample other items."}
{"text":"Ok, let's start off with the food!

The food was cheap...very cheap actually. I think the 2 item combos were about $6, and the selection is plentiful. I went with what I knew, and chose the Lechon Kawali, Sisig, and Adobo.

The Lechon Kawali was a good meaty version here...not nearly as much fat as the other place I had it at, but the flavor isn't as good here...the benefit of all that fat! It's a catch 22 

The Sisig...a little different than I've had. This was a bit more soupy on the bottom, versus a more dried consistency. Good though...just prefer the dried/more fried version myself.

And of course, the Chicken Adobo...very tasty and flavorful, but there were tiny little splinters of bone that distracted me from loving the dish. They need to sharpen that Butcher's knife! It was fall off the bone tender though, with a strong soy sauce flavor.  I'd skip this personally.

So bang for your buck, this is good food for the money! BUT :

I hit the restroom on the way out, and saw DEAD BUGS on the ground...GROSS! So I told myself, at least they are dead...the pesticides must be working right? But now I am worried and start looking around on the ground...noticed a live one walkin around in the middle of the day. Bleh...at least it was after I ate, because I sure as hell didn't have an appetite after that.

It was only till after my visit, that I noticed the other Yelper that posted up pics of a bug IN THEIR FOOD.  If I would have saw that, chances are, I would NOT have ate here... 

Good luck!"}
{"text":"Food is always delicious! They have every Filipino food favorites, turon, lechon kawali, tocilog, dinuguan, and more! And the tinderas are always nice!
The only bad thing is that it's very cramped inside. Wish they have more space."}
{"text":"Wonderful selection! Food is good, friendly staff and well decorated dining area parang nasa pinas lang!  they have many pasalubong options too!"}
{"text":"If you're tired of hotel buffets while in Las Vegas and craving for Filipino food,
This is the place to go!
Found this gem few minutes away from the strip.
The food and service are superb!
The place is really clean and has really cute table set ups and decors. The owner is super friendly as well. 
By the way I'm from San Diego so when it comes to pinoy food I'm really picky.
But this place exceeded my expectations"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Filipino go to spots in Vegas. Never gets old and love how their selection changes daily. Today they had garlic fried rice which is unheard of after breakfast time.

Wish I could learn how to make the famous garlic rice, the YouTube videos I have seen don't show any that taste like the real thing. :-(

I will for sure be back when in town."}
{"text":"Best food in Vegas! Lots of choices.. unfortunately seems like the goat is always out when I am there?"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Main entrees were not that good.  The pork adobo was fatty, the pork BBQ was chewy, ukoy was not even crispy.  I've had better tasting Filipino food."}
{"text":"Awesome meal! There are many side dishes to choose from. It was clean and the busser was there to take your dirty dishes right away."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place since 2011 (I'm from san diego) the food is great, portion size GREAT, I always get lechon and unlike places in san diego, they consistently have lechon, very good service via busboy, seems like it's harder to order if you don't speak tag along (only reason i didn't give the full 5 stars)"}
{"text":"5 stars for very friendly and attentive service (we weren't there during rush hour though). 5 stars for cleanliness of dining room and bathroom. And for the price of the food, I give it 4.5 stars for quality and portion size. Also 5 stars for extensive entree options and extensive drink options. Thanks for a quick and awesome meal!"}
{"text":"The food is very authentic, the food is awesome. The rice is rich and delicious. The atmosphere is very friendly and the servers are fantastic. I would recommend trying this spot out if your in vegas."}
{"text":"Filipino server told me about this place and I'm glad he did cause it's right next to my place.  Great little shop and the food was outstanding for filipino fast food.  Got a whole piece of fish with soup, tamarind broth on the side just for my rice, and barbecue, rice, and diniguan.  It was all amazing and fresh and was almost tempted to get a Sarsi root beer as well.  It was also nice to see that the Laker game was on and it wasn't just Filipino Variety shows on TFC."}
{"text":"Yelp's 365 Review Challenge 2014  #291 - #365

We were staying at Encore and my cousin's were craving some authentic Filipino food. They heard from a friend how good this restaurant was so off we went. The area is pretty bad located just East of the Stratosphere Hotel, I didn't have any bad experiences with the  neighborhood, so that's a plus. It seemed like your run of the mill Filipino restaurant that you'd see in any other US city. 

Food here was meh. They didn't have a lot of selection and most of their hot trays were empty so we were stuck with few options. On the bright side, they did have crispy pata ready to be cooked. I didn't know how much the plate cost because I didn't pay, woot!

If I had a choice, I'd rather go to China Town and have some Thai or Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This is the one of the cleanest Filipino restaurants I've been to in vegas.  The food is always fresh and delicious.  We've been here a numerous amounts of time and although we do not really sit and chat with them, they remember us and greet us like they've known us a long time."}
{"text":"This place is better than most places. My hubbie and I had two combos with 2 sides, yema, and two pieces of turon and it was a total of 25 dollars.  Not bad.  When we came in we were greeted by a man who stood there if anybody needed anything.  He gave us napkins while we pointed out what we wanted.  Like most filipino places, they're usually watching some filipino show.  The food was great and it was near our hotel. That's a plus! I finally found a place to eat while we're in town!"}
{"text":"HALO-HALO CHALLENGE 2013 - Contender #9

\"This is our very own.\" 
That's what the name of this restaurant, Ito'y Sariling Atin, means.  I know because I asked my mom, who was born and raised in the Philippines, unlike me, who was born in Akron, OH, raised in Cerritos, CA, and have parents who didn't teach me Tagalog.  Now you know, too.

As the Halo-Halo Challenge winds down, contender #9 brought us to yet another Filipino fast food place that we've never visited.  One thing Mel and I have learned in this short period of time doing the challenge is that Las Vegas has A LOT of Filipino food restaurants.  We're only going to review ten of them for this go-round, but there are still many beyond that number.  ISA is a \"turo-turo\" style place where you \"point-point\" at the food you want, just like those other places where you line up at the counter and can get two or three-item combos with rice. We didn't have any food, but I thought I'd let you know in case you want to eat here.
We didn't see halo-halo on the menu, but just ordered it anyway, knowing that they did offer it. The lady behind the counter starting speaking to Mel in Tagalog--uh oh.  When this happens and you don't understand what's being said, you just keep answering in English.  She got the message and finally told us that it would take ten minutes.  Oh, okay.  The price here is $5.25 for the icy dessert and theirs had:

Ube ice cream, kaong, azuki, one piece of leche flan, nata de coco, white beans, jam, and chunky ice, again.  What's with the chunky ice?  Challenger #7 also had chunky ice.  I am not a fan of little icebergs in my bowl that I need to stab with my plastic spoon.  
No macapuno, langka, ube, or pinipig in this version.
Other than the chunky ice, this halo-halo is not too shabby.  It's only missing a couple of ingredients that I prefer to make it one of my favorites so far. HALO-HALO+TURO-TURO=YUM-YUM - 9 down, 1 left!

{"text":"WOW

We wish we had a place like this in Maryland! 

They pile on a generous portion of food to fit the entire carryout container. My husband and I got tocino, longanisa, extra egg, fried rice, and sinigang pompano. Devoured it all in less than 10 minutes. Food was so good, we felt like we were back in the Philippines. Lots of options here, and we would have come back for more if we had been in Vegas longer!"}
{"text":"this place reminded me of the old carinderia's in the Philippines. they style of it is \"turo-turo\" same style as if you went to \"Goldilocks\" except better tasting =). you get 2 entrees with the rice and if you want they have soup on the side that they offer since Filipino's love to eat rice with \"sabaw\" or soup. they have plenty of sections from adobo, sinigang, afritad, menudo, almost any popular Filipino dishes they have it. i also got to try a soda that's original from the islands called \"Sarsi\" does it bring back memories when i was a kid drinking it out of a small sandwhich bag with straw (you guys know what i'm talking about if you grew up there) i would definitely come back on my next Vegas trip. it's nice to be away from the strip once in awhile"}
{"text":"3 years ago, I moved away from my Filipino family and their amazing traditional meals that I would eat every day. When I'm missing them and missing their food, this is where I come to fill my void. Though it's nothing compared to mom & dad's cooking, it is still good!!! I've been here a few times and though it's about 40 minutes from my house, it's worth the drive for me!! I get sooo much food for sooo cheap!! They have a huge selection of food options. I really like their sinigang and constantly crave their fried chicken skins (omggg yum) and anything they have is pretty good!! I think I might make a trip there today actually - just writing about it makes me hungry!! haha."}
