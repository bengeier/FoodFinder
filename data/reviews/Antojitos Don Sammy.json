{"text":"My new favorite taco and burrito place. This is by far the best place for delicious and authentic food. I lived in California for a while and this place truly reminds me of that down home taste my good friends often shared."}
{"text":"Best taco stand in Charlotte. Great food and excellent customer service! Highly recommend it. =]"}
{"text":"Being a native Southern Californian living in North Carolina, I miss Mexican food like mad; taco shops on every corner, bomb Cali burritos and carne asada fries. There's good Mexican food here in Charlotte, but it's just not the same. This place, while different from my San Diego joints, is really good. This isn't health food though, so don't go if you're picky about that. There's no seating to speak of, so plan on taking it to go or having a picnic. An intimate setting, colorful paint scheme, and a fairly small, but delicious, menu give this place a lot of character. The staff was super nice too. Mexican food, and burritos in particular, are my passion and if you're anything like me, and looking for just straight up good Mexican that has you licking your fingers afterwards, give this place a try."}
{"text":"My GOODNESS!! Tacos Al Pastor- to die for!!! This place is GREAT!!!! Not from around here but we were looking for something quick but good (good luck right) we scored on this one!! The yelp reviews are great so why not right?!?! WORTH IT!! They don't take cards (FYI) and don't count on the ATM at the gas station next door (out of service the day we went). Oh! They take call in orders too!!"}
{"text":"If you want authentic Mexican food this is the place to go.  The burritos are large enough for 2 to share - that is if you want to.   They are so delicious I am sure you will want to keep it all to yourself.  Everything my husband &  I have eaten there (including the salsa) is delicious:-)"}
{"text":"Humble taco stand with authentic options and thoughtfully prepared Mexican fare.  Got two chorizo tacos (for $2.50/ea) that were packed with flavor and came with some house-made hot sauce. Very friendly service that's quick and serves delicious food. Can't go wrong with tacos here."}
{"text":"This place is closed. If it's a food truck then it's gone too.  We drove to this location near the airport because the reviews showed 4 stars. When we arrived at its location the building was abandoned. The area around was questionable. Don't waste your time I'm going. It's closed up."}
{"text":"Wow! I got two chicken tacos and they were pretty awesome. Highly recommend this place! I think the homemade tortillas is my favorite part of it."}
{"text":"No matter how far this place may be from you. It is worth the ride. I got tacos de lengua, cabeza, and asada. I don't know which one was better than the last one.  The cabeza was the best one actually. That is my new favorite. It used to be the tongue. Now it's the head the tongue was in.   If you think anything is dry it's cause you don't know how to eat tacos."}
{"text":"This is food truck has the best tacos in all of Charlotte. We've tried all of the tacos now and they are all so good. Their homemade tortillas are impossible to beat. I would recommend taking your food to the lookout spot at the airport to watch the planes and take off."}
{"text":"The great taco search continues... Food truck addition. Stopped in to see Don Sammy at his taco truck on the corner of Little Rock and Wilkerson. It's  in the airport express gas station.   It take a little bit to cook because the food is made to order. The tortillas are made by hand and very good. I ordered a mix plate of tacos al pastor, asada and campechano. Though very good, they were not great. The price is equal to other trucks, at $2 per taco and I would recommend stopping by to support a small business"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I saw the reviews and wanted to try it for myself. I went after they were already closed (they close at 10pm) the señoras there were kind enough and amazing to give me their own dinner! And it was amazing! Muchísimas gracias! Salí más de feliz!!! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is great along with the great food and their sauce is spicy which I like and they also have Mexican corn which is a must!"}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to yelp when I had s conference at a local hotel. I didn't want hotel food so made the short drive to the food truck randomly parked at a gas station. Two tacos, rice and beans later, I was in heaven and for under $10. Such a great find."}
{"text":"I need to start first by stating that Yelp should allow for +-1/2 star ratings.  I hate giving these folks a 4-star rating, because it should me more.  I really want to rate them at 4  1/2 stars.  But they won't let me do that.  I was staying at a hotel near the Charlotte airport and found this place on Yelp the night before I was to leave.  Their reviews convinced me I had to try their food.    I spent the first 42 years of my life in Southern California, so I've had a lot of traditional tacos.  Well, Tacos Don Sammy seem to be close to traditional, at least from my experience.  The flavors are there, but I've never had grilled onions on any tacos I've had in So. Cal.  That said, they hit it right out of the park with the addition of those onions!  My only reason for not giving them a full 5-star rating is that their steak taco was rather dry.  The flavor was great, but it did move my experience down from being able to give a full 5-star rating. The chicken taco was wonderful.  I just want to say again how much I enjoyed the flavors of their food, and the folks running this place are fantastic.  They were really friendly, which always makes me appreciate a place even more.  Please keep up the great work!  Additional information for travelers: If you stop in at the gas/market in the same parking lot, you'll discover a great deal.  I'm usually a craft beer snob, but not when it comes to complementing tacos.  I decided to go in and grab a beer for my dinner.  Nothing like a PBR with tacos!  They had pounder cans, so I bought one.  When he rang it up and stated, \"that'll be $1.06\"... I was floored.  I don't think I've ever been in that type of gas station/market where I've seen them not absolutely gouge you on beer.  Their price was more than reasonable. (I went back and bought 3 to take back to my hotel :-)"}
{"text":"Best Burritos with Bombacious flavor. The closest thing to a Cali Burrito. It's right past the airport to the right next to the gas station. I had the steak burrito. Highly recommend this place for Mexican food. Worth the $8 close to Cali price. Cali price is $7ish. Way better then these fake upscale want to be Mexican food places. Will only go here for my Mexican food from now on here in  Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"Sorry Charlotte, I'm not seeing what the big fuss is about.  Ordered two Tacos and a Burrito.  Taco's were dry, don't get the double corn tortilla, just helped with the dryness.  Burrito was good, nice combo of seasoned meat, rice...................I guess if you're going by and hungry it's worthwhile, but I wouldn't go out of my way.................."}
{"text":"Holy Tijuana Mexican Street tacos . I had the tongue, liver, cabeza and el pastor. It was amazing. The perfect amount of salt to meat to tortilla(looks Homemade) ratio. Paired well with the side of grilled onions and cactus (?)..was just plain amazing. All I was missing was the hangover. Más please...I'll be hitting this place every time I'm in charlotte. Make sure you call ahead, and get the correct address.."}
{"text":"Yummy in my Tummy! I didn't know what to expect as this food truck is next to a strip club and gas station but I thought hey you only live once. Don't judge a book by its cover because the food was good and plentiful. I had the chicken and steak fajitas and they were full of flavor. The chef takes his time preparing your meal but I don't mind if he's preparing food like this. He said he used to have a restaurant but the building was sold and he is looking for another location. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Don't let the location or the look of the building fool you. When I tell you this is THE BEST PLACE FOR AUTHENTIC MEXICAN EATS! I cannot stop eating their taco gringos Omg so yummy and everything is cooked to order right in front of you. This is the only place that can compare to the Hispanic food in California! You have to try it! DEFINITELY DESERVES MORE THAN 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"O.M.G.....BEST TACOS EVER.  I love this little place. Staff is very good and friendly.  Please stop by and try the Tacos Gringo with Green Sauce."}
