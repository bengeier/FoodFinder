{"text":"1) Crepe 
- Nothing special about the crepe. The basic topping was jam. Costs ectra for toppings like fruit, nutella, etc.

2) Macarons
- Flavours sound unique but some were strange. Lavender was my favourite. 

3) Creme brule 
- The custard was ok. The brule could've been done better. It didn't taste like it was made to order."}
{"text":"Haven't went out for dessert for quite awhile and me and some friends happened to drop by this place for some amazing desserts after dinner. Love the crepes here! My husband likes the ambience. There are lots of pictures and special lighting fixture. We ordered a green tea cheese cake, 3 crepes and they are wonderful! Will def come back again!"}
{"text":"one of my favorite neighborhood dessert places...

Must haves: gelato (any flavor), truffles (any flavor) 
service: pretty attentive, friendly staff 
atmosphere: love the decor, very chill"}
{"text":"Nice place for gelato! Macarons were tasty but a wee tiny bit. Will come back if we are in the area but definitely not drive to eat desserts. There are more better places in Richmond Hill/ Markham area."}
{"text":"Best dessert place ever. Luv the smell of the place. Have some cute chocolate. Tried the lava cake and loved it"}
{"text":"Came here a few times before but tonight I am extremely disappointed. Their service was horrible and the waitresses were unhelpful. Never returning again"}
{"text":"warm & salty chocolate crepe... i can't even finish a half of it... I dun think i'll come again..."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to visit this place.  As you step inside,  you can taste the chocolate in the air.  Off to a good start already. 

We ordered the dark chocolate bowl with mango mousse and a strawberry banana waffle with peach gelato.  

Both were delicious but a little on the expensive side.  The chocolate bowl was pretty small.  Waffle was average size.  Our bill came out to $23.95 for the 2 desserts. 

Looking through the menu, other items seems to be priced a little higher than average as well. 

Will I come back... maybe.  Hard to say.  If a friend wants to try it out, I would go.  But will not be my first suggestion."}
{"text":"We had ordered 6 items of almost $80 worth for 8 people. They insisted that their store policy is one order per person. We had explained that we have one diabetic and  one hypertensive guest in our group and is restricted for food. Despite explaining the situation, the manager didn't want to make an exception. This is absolute discrimination. This is the type of business that should not be supported.  No wonder the place is practically empty on a Saturday evening!"}
{"text":"Must order at least one item for each person?! Don't like the service. The food may get a 3 stars. That's all."}
{"text":"108 is a new cafe ? What attracted me was the word CHOCOLATE. Why? Because in the midst of Scarborough, one would find many Asian cuisine but chocolate with dessert is a rarity! 
So I drove there to find out more..
What I saw was a real life chocolate making machine, churning away making scrumptious chocolate dessert. 

In the fridge was all sorts of hand made truffles with quality rivaling to many high end places! but NOt at the high end pice. 
In the shelf, there was dark, milk chocolate dessert bars... Taste better than Godiva and 1/3 the price..
I decided to try their latte and creme brûlée, 
The latte was nicely decorated with an artistic flair. I found out later that the chocolatier lady is the dame artist who adorned the walls with many photographs , her work.. 
Latte was quite good.. Strong but not over powering..
The creme brûlée that I ordered was ginger .. It was  sweet with a tinge of ginger. 
Being an Asian place, desserts tend to be less sugary which is fine by me. 
Suggestion would be to serve it with a bit of plating, similar to the latte... 
The place is cozy . The enthusiasm of the server is to please .. Some minor start up challenge e.g. Serve latte with options of chocolate, cinnamon powder will add a special touch.

Overall, a quaint new place for people who enjoy desserts with a French flair without the high price...

A gem in the \"hood\"!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a one star, not even half star! Will never give them my business. They have a policy that  everyone in the party has to order something and no exception. That's just ridiculous! It's the most stupid policy I ever heard."}
{"text":"Came here at 11pm on a Saturday on a long weekend. 
Desserts were good.
Service was good, no complaints really. 
Atmosphere is really nice. 
Probably will come back to give the chocolates a try."}
{"text":"I've visited this place about 3 times now and have probably spent at least $100 trying out different menu items by now. While the interior is very comfortable and has the feel of some trendy downtown dessert places, this store in my opinion is way overpriced for the portion and quality that it offers.

Macaron assorted plate:
These macarons are not made in house and are from the store's supplier. Macarons are presented on a long plate with a variety of flavours. They look amazing with their smooth domes but really aren't anything special; they don't even compare to some other stores. While their flavours such as lavender are good, the quality of the macaron itself isn't what I would expect for the price. Every macaron I bit into had at least 1 hollow shell.

Signature hot chocolate :
According to the menu, the hot chocolate is supposedly made with Swiss premium chocolate from Lindt with a touch of madagascar vanilla chocolate, but I highly doubt that. The hot chocolate itself tastes as if it was made with half the amount of hot chocolate powder that would normally be in a drink with a lot of cocoa powder added in, thus making it a bitter rather than sweet. While I don't know if that is really how they make the drink, it sure tastes that way; that would account for all the powder residue that's on the sides of the cup as you finish the drink. When making authentic hot chocolate, you must melt a little block or square of solid chocolate. This, of course, means that as your drink cools, it should at the very least thicken and start to solidify. The hot chocolate here didn't even come close to getting a bit thicker at room temperature. If you've ever had hot chocolate at places such as Ambiance at Queen & Broadview then you'd know it doesn't even compare.

Cheese & Portobello Mushroom with Black Pepper Crepe:
Crepe with the filling combination is very tasty but it is grossly misrepresented. If you open up the crepe, you will notice that the mushrooms are absolutely not portobello mushrooms. There isn't even a single piece or two of portobello mushroom mixed in; it's only button mushrooms. I paid so much money expecting portobello mushrooms and if I had known that it was only button mushrooms then I would not have ordered the crepe for such a high price. Store needs to update the menu to avoid false advertising.

Chocolate sweet crepe with nutella, bananas and strawberry:
This sweet crepe was actually quite filling and tasty. Just be careful though, the sweet crepe itself is about $5.50 and it will get you just a crepe with nothing aside from things like sauce or a bit of jam inside. If you want filling inside your crepe then you must order add-ons.

Truffles:
I'm sorry to say that I had the poor judgement to try a hazelnut truffle on my second visit after some other disappointing menu items. Truffles are supposed to be made with a chocolate ganache centre coated in chocolate, and what I ate was absolutely not a truffle. It may have looked like one, but it was more like a hazelnut coated in an extremely thick layer of chocolate in the shape of a truffle. I was really hoping that these chocolates would be good as it is their house specialty and their products cost as much as, if not more than, places such as Ambiance, Godiva or Purdy's.

White chocolate bowl with cappuccino mousse, topped with crushed hazelnut:
Chocolate bowl with mousse wasn't bad. It was pretty tasty. I just feel that they should have put them on smaller plates so customers don't feel like it's way smaller than what they're getting.

Chocolate lava cake:
This menu item requires a 15 minute wait but was actually worth it. Chocolate lava cakes tend to be annoying to make. Overbake it and it becomes a plain chocolate cake; underbake it and it is just gooey mush. The chocolate lava cake that arrived at my table on this huge plate had a chocolate cake exterior with a gooey chocolate lava centre. Like the chocolate bowls, I feel that the store should serve these cakes on smaller plates. The huge plate just seems very disproportionate to the size of the cake itself and makes me feel ripped off.

Serradura:
They didn't have this menu item anymore when I asked. Looks like they'll be having gelato starting next month instead.

Overall, this place has a beautiful interior design and late hours. It's one of the few dessert shops you'll find in the Scarborough area. I think this place would be more popular if they lowered the price, updated their menu and fixed a few menu items. I've already spent more than enough money trying out various overpriced menu items and most likely would not be coming back here again mainly due to the cost."}
{"text":"Came for the cheese cake soufflé. Ordered the lemon and original flavour. Both are quite good... the original is very cheesy, while the lemon has no cheese flavour at all. So it depends on what you want, but both are good options. Unfortunately, the addition of cheese deflates the soufflé very quickly while not really adding that much to the dish. It's a bit creamier... like a light Japanese cheesecake. Ultimately, I don't think it's that great of an idea and wished they offered the original dessert instead.

Location is what I'd consider \"up-scale\" bubble tea. Okay seating, contemporary design, not quite as comfortable as a Starbucks and yet you know they were trying to mimic them. There's an open kitchen where you can see them prepping their chocolate, if you care about that kind of stuff. It seems popular enough with the locals as there were all ages sitting around on a Saturday afternoon, from a family with a grandparent to some teenagers taking selfies while putting on make up."}
{"text":"I came with my friends today, ordered pancake, lava cake, macaroon and chocolate potato chips. But it had make me upset because the macaroon's crust wasn't crunchy, is too soft and only the lavender and apricot was great to try. Lava cake is too hard and dry. The pancake is too sweet cause of too much chocolate inside, for chocolate strawberry and banana pancake should only have little chocolate inside to make the sweetness."}
{"text":"Shared a marshmallow nutella toast and a strawberry banana chocolate crepe. The crepe was slightly thicker than most places and they didn't cheap out on the fruits so I really like that. The crepe also had just the right amount sweetness. The toast was also quite good but it got pretty sweet by the end. Cappuccino had good strong coffee . $25 for 2 ppl for 2 desserts & 2 drinks. Slightly pricey but not way out of line."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. The service is always really good (always coming by to refill your water, and they always look happy to serve you) and the desserts are delicious. If you are a fan of cheesecake, the special white chocolate cheesecake is a must try. The coconut creme brule is also really good. They recently added a few things to their menu, such as freshly made Gelato! Price for the Gelato was a bit expensive but it was one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Walked in half an hour before close on a rainy Monday night. Warm welcome, service with a smile. Water right away and menus. Prices seemed a bit higher than average at first glance, decor was befitting a chocolate shoppe. I ordered the grass jelly with coconut gelato and mixed fruits. At a whopping $7.95, I was initially disappointed by the portion size. Good thing I was wrong.The goblet must've created some sort of optical illusion. Could have sworn there was less! Another pleasant surprise: the coconut gelato was a winner! Great texture and generous shavings, it added value and paired well. I will definitely return to try more of their menu, albeit infrequently and only when I feel like indulging."}
{"text":"Horrible Services and Rules! I would not recommend this place to anyone.

The cafe asked every customers to order 1 dessert and the rule is listed on the very last page of the menu. It was our first time dinning there and we did not know the rule. We ordered the fondue set (12 scoops of ice cream, 4 macaroons, some fruits, nuts) between the four of us. After the foods arrived, another waitress warned us to order more.  We were upset as we were not aware of the rules, and we could have ordered none shared items. At the end, we gave in and ordered more foods. However, the waitresses labelled us as \"trouble maker\" and had her eyes on us afterward. She kept bugging us for little things. 

To be fair, food taste OK for that price. The pricing for the over counter truffles and macaroons are not consistance comparing to other bakeries. Some are over priced and some are OK.  The place does get packed, but there is a 3 hrs sitting policy. The place is pretty, clean and not too noisy (even it is busy). 

However, would I come back for more desserts? Absolutely not! I guess we are not welcome anyways!"}
{"text":"Don't ever order the Bloody Cesar.  It doesn't make sense to sell one at a desert place.  


No spice.  No Worcestershire sauce.

Tasted funny. 

I'll update with my stomach in a few hours."}
{"text":"Always come here for the black sesame gelato, hits the spot every time. Yes it's over priced but for the quality I don't mind."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends and family. I had their homemade peach gelato which was quite tasty. Their cheesecake soufflé was great and very fluffy. Their mango supreme was sweet and creamy. Will come back. Very nice place to hang!"}
{"text":"That was the first time I had a crepe with herb and garlic cream cheese. I am a bit on the healthier side of things so ice cream or syrups are avoided - so it was nice to see a place offer variety. They have coffees and other drinks including fondue. The prices are quite good for the portions they serve here. The service was quick and they had a steady flow of people coming in on a Wednesday night. Its located in an Asian plaza where numerous Asian restaurants and stores are. I found this place as I was looking for a late night café (hard to come by these days as bars are the preferred choice by most and places not serving alcohol don't stay open late as a result). It was a good experience overall."}
{"text":"Loved the desserts. 

You have got to try the Lindt sweet crepe with Nutella and chopped hazelnuts. In comparison to other places, I could still taste the chocolate and it was worth the extra cost. 

The creme brûlée was also really good. Note: it wasn't as sweet as other places so be prepared. 

The staff were quite friendly and attentive. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Desserts were pretty good, pricey, but good. It has a really nice cute little dessert shop vibe where you feel like you could spend  a good portion of your day there (of course purchasing food along the way) studying, catching up with friends, etc. Sadly, there are maximum sit times allowed and minimum 1 order per person rules."}
{"text":"Overpriced for sure but great atmosphere and tasty desserts. Service was very friendly although they don't ask if you need anything, instead they quietly walk around the tables. Reminded me of a ghost :P

Sweet Crepes: 5.50 with additional toppings for $1-3. Signature Hot Chocolate: 5.25

It's a great place to chat with friends and splurge on something sweet if you've got the dough.

Question: Why was the water warm?!"}
{"text":"Quite a cute cafe! The durian sago dessert there is a MUST HAVE for durian lovers. The servers are pretty attentive and there is ample parking there."}
{"text":"Food/sweets- Not the best. Chocolate, cake and ice cream are made in-house, which is great. But taste is a 4/10. 5/10 at best. I was disappointed especially compared to what you are paying for.

Menu- wide variety of sweets, drinks.

Staff- friendly. Not proficient in English.

Place- Clean, trendy, and very stylish.

Summary- won't go back again just cause sweets didn't taste as good as they looked. Especially in that price range."}
{"text":"Great place for an intimate after dinner hang out. Specialty chocolatiers are a rare find in Scarborough.

Great ambience. Very cozy and clean. The truffles are interesting with a good variety to choose from. The spicy hot chocolate  was very rich and PRETTY SPICY! Had to take my time with it. Creme brûlée was very light and flavorful.

Some menu items I would like to have tried but $10 for a chocolate cup with green tea mousse smaller than half the size of your palm? Hmm I'll browse for other items on the menu that promise a greater return..."}
{"text":"Inviting ambiance, quiet jazzy music in background, great desert selection and chocolate truffles on display to enjoy at home.  I had a novel take on a banana split.  The table also had crepe with one of dozens of choices of gelato and a lava cake that could have used some spicy heat"}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy weeknight and it wasn't busy at all! The service was polite and timely. Everything on the menu looked absolutely delicious. Clearly presentation means a lot to them and it shows! 

Drinks: The latte and hot chocolate we ordered were very good! You can choose the sweetness level you want and they'll give you a cute heart-shaped chocolate thats in accordance to the sweetness level you ordered to dip into the drink and swirl around until it melts completely which is pretty cool! 

Dessert: We ordered the s'mores toast obviously because it looked mouth watering! Although to me it definitely looked better than it tasted. It felt like I could've made something similar at home. It was just chocolate, marshmallow and toast and tasted mediocre. I'm sure their other dessert options on the menu are far better.

Drinks: 4/5
Dessert: 3/5
Ambience: 4/5

I wouldn't mind coming again to try their other desserts and of course order another latte"}
{"text":"This dessert place is cute, delicious but overpriced. The service is decent but last time I was there, every person that sits down has to order at least one thing which I don't really agree with. Everything is pretty good. The gelato, matcha, and white chocolate cheesecake really stood out to me but it is expensive. It makes a good special occasion place, but I don't go often."}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with 0109. My durian-loving friends really enjoy this place, and then there's me who's very anti-durian. 

Their durian options have evolved over time. They first offered a durian cheesecake, and now a durian Asian-dessert with a scoop of durian gelato. I hear it's good. Because all I could tell you is that it really smells like durian! 

I've ordered their cheesecake soufflé and really enjoy it. It's the best of both worlds if you're looking for some type of heartwarming dessert. 

The chocolate lava cake is a hit or miss. There are times when it's over baked and there's no lava, and some days it's spot on. It's not overly sweet and has a hint of dark chocolate bitterness. 

This place does tend to get quite cozy at night and may have a short wait period. Worth trying even if you're not a durian fan!"}
{"text":"Eek. This place is ridiculously overpriced for a dainty dessert place. 

They advertise that all ingredients used are natural and they only use pure Lindt chocolate but I still wouldn't pay $7 for a small cup of (ie) tiramisu. After seeing the tiny size on their menu, I double checked with the server to confirm that the picture was to scale. She nodded \"yes, it's really small\".. So OK then! 

I tried their Macaron plate ($12) - it was nothing fantastic and certainly incomparable to the Macaron boutiques downtown. The Eiffel Tower chocolate wasn't bad though. 

The white chocolate cheesecake was nicely plated but too sweet for me personally. There's only a slight hint of cheese if any. 

I see on the side they sell prepackaged chocolate that are all more expensive than Godiva.. 

If I thought you were worth it, maybe I would come back, but sorry, this isn't holts so don't expect customers to pay the price."}
{"text":"0109 is perfect cafe and dessert place. They have their own chocolate and truffles. Their own cheesecake and souffle is so unique. They also sell gelatos as well. They have so many unique desserts and their aesthetics is on the charts. Have one of the best crepes and cheesecakes!!!!! Their strawberry jam with whip cream and nutella sweet crepes is a good recommendation."}
{"text":"What I like most about this place is their nice interior and hours. The walls are covered in photographs and they have nice wooden tables with comfortable seating.  They're also open until 1 in the morning, which I find very convenient

Their food in my opinion is just average.  The single scoop gelato served on their plates happen to always melt very quickly.. Their crepes are decent.  I find that they never have much filling inside and that it is usually not anything spectacular."}
{"text":"I echo the sentiments of other review posters. Desserts are pretty good, but might be a bit overpriced. I think the \"one order per person\" thing isn't entirely unfair considering you're allowed to sit for 3 hours once you've ordered something. 

When my friends and I went, we ordered their Ice Cream Fondue. It came with dipping chocolate, 12 scoops of gelato (vanilla, raspberry, chocolate, chocolate mint, pistachio, coconut, black sesame, matcha, lemon, birthday cake, hazelnut, etc) four macarons, bananas, grapes, strawberries, and nuts. It was a pretty fun item! We could dip the ice cream into the chocolate fondue and it would form a thin layer of chocolate! I advise eating the gelato first as it melts quickly. 

We also tried their durian cheese cake, which was okay and had the rich taste of durian. The main problem was how small it was (4 x 4 inch square). 

We also tried the tiramisu. I feel like I could make a better tiramisu and the price was not worth it. 

I've also come before for their coffee and their souffle cheesecakes. Their souffle cheesecakes are probably my favourite thing at this place."}
{"text":"Overpriced for sure but decent nonetheless. Ordered two crepes, one Lindt chocolate with strawberries, bananas and salted caramel gelato and the second, cinnamon with strawberries, bananas and coconut gelato. Both were good (Lindt one being better) and also ordered an espresso, which was much better than expected. I would definitely recommend this place over demetri's and Cafe mirage and would definitely return. 

Service is as good as it gets for an Asian establishment. Looking forward to try their other items on the menu."}
{"text":"At first I wanted to visit the tea place in the plaza but it wasn't open and I ran upon this little store in the corner by Chako. I was delighted to find a dessert place so close to where I loved since I have a big sweet tooth.

The first time I went in I didn't have the time to sit in and order anything but the manager(?) was very nice and let me browse the chocolates on display and take a look at their menu. The chocolates were all hand-made right behind the counter, it was really neat to see. The truffles in the fridge all looked really nice, I'm already planning on buying some to give as gifts this Christmas. The prices were relatively alright for such nice chocolates. They also have macarons but it only seems to come in one flavour? (Probably chocolate?)

Today I went in with my sister and we were greeted warmly by the waitress. Her English was not superb but her service was very attentive and welcoming. She even pulled out the chairs for us. We were given menus and she gave us recommendations, apparently the Tiramisu is a good choice. We ordered a strawberry cheesecake and a lava cake. I was told that the lava cake would take about 15-20min because they had to put it in the oven on order, which is fine and normal. My sister had the strawberry cheesecake in which she said \"tasted like strawberries with a cheesy aftertaste\". The cheesecake was the right amount of sweetness. My lava cake arrived after my sister had finished her cheesecake, right out of the oven. It smelled positively scrumptious. The cake wasn't very sweet (maybe because I told them I liked dark chocolate? I don't know) and the center was really gooey. It wasn't a big serving but I felt very filled by it, maybe because the center was very thick? The plating for these were simple and neat, it was very clean to look at.

The atmosphere was really nice, the interior felt really warm. Having jazz music accompany the sweet chocolate aroma made for a really relaxing experience. I'm not sure I'm satisfied by the price but I feel like it is an enjoyable place for a nice dessert or quiet coffee/chocolate break.

ETA: They are closed on Tuesdays, however, so do plan to go on the other days of the week from 11am-11pm (if I recall correctly)."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for desserts because of its convenient location but tonight I was extremely disappointed at their service. The dessert tasted great as usual but the service was horrible. They also should change their policy of having one minimum order per person. What about the small fondue that could be shared among two people ? What if someone just didn't want anything to eat and just wanted to be there for company ? Anyways, the chances of me returning are very slim."}
{"text":"I was very surprised by all the different choices on the menu for a dessert place. My first time going was very pleasant and we ordered the Marshmellow Toast and Panna Cotta. The toast looked better than it tasted but was still fairly decent.  The Panna Cotta was very flavourful.

They also have Gelato Fondue on their menu which I believe is about $30 but looked like a lot of gelato (maybe enough for 4 people). Would like to try that next time!"}
{"text":"A cute dessert cafe that boasts some very pretty desserts and snacks. I had the mango sago, and it tasted alright. Nothing amazing. Looking at the menu though, a lot of the stuff they offer is visually pleasing, but the thing that persuaded me to give only 2 stars is that this cafe is very, very expensive. I really wanted to try their macarons plate with the little Eiffel Tower chocolate because it looked so cute, but the price of that was almost ridiculous. I couldnt afford to dish out that much for just five measly little macarons :(. Such a shame!"}
{"text":"Location wise this is a good spot for dessert but their service is hands down awful. This is a dessert café - normally you would think people could come here to share a big waffle with ice cream or something. Nope. They now have a rule that every person at the table must order at least one plate. That rule is ridiculous and frankly just very unwelcoming considering this is not a huge place and the whole idea behind dessert cafes is a casual atmosphere where sharing huge servings of desserts is encouraged. The menu is alright but honestly not good enough to trump the awful service. I prefer D-Spot."}
{"text":"Cute and basic desserts, overpriced in my opinion though. It's a good place to hang out with friends or for a quick coffee date."}
{"text":"Upon arrival I had high hopes - gelato and chocolate made in-house with natural ingredients, 0109 was promising me the good stuff only found at home or at high prices. The place is decked out in IKEA gear - hipster lamp installation above the open concept kitchen, the chairs I'm sure come from IKEA's garden/patio selection, the cutlery, the tea pots (I own the same one at home! It is a good one I must say). It gives it that homey feeling that everything is made right there with things that you recognize. A large selection of chocolate products are displayed on the side counter and in the display case - from chocolate bars to molded chocolates to flavoured truffles - all for prices that remind me of Laura Secord, Purdy's, or even Lindt's outlet store at Vaughan Mills. Everything is luxuriously packaged and branded with a gold 0109 sticker to make it all the fancier. Quite a sight!

The dessert prices proved to be acceptable though the coffee on the expensive side (more than Starbucks?!) and the gelato was tasty...but I have a few items to note. 

Firstly, there is a requirement that everyone in the party must order an item - a 1:1 ratio on items to patrons. There won't be any cutesy sharing of a crêpe, or a drink, or anything under $15. There are a few select shareable items that will count for two people - notably the selection of 4 gelato scoops, and the gelato/macaron/marshmallows fondue set. The portion is quite large so I was annoyed that even the large fondue set counted for only TWO ORDERS.

Next, about my order. Affogatos marry my love for coffee and ice cream, so I was excited to see it on the menu. I expected a choice of gelato flavour, to which I was told it is default vanilla and any changes is an extra dollar. I rationed, maybe the vanilla gelato is cheaper, to which a friend identifies it on the menu as being the exact same price as all the other flavours. I guess I paid extra for having to remind the kitchen of my special order? This was disappointing, particularly since the waitress didn't even consider to inform me the gelato flavour. I ended up paying the dollar to get mint chocolate chip gelato in lieu of vanilla, which made the order much more interesting. The espresso is presented on the side but if you're not quick the waitress will pour all of it onto your gelato immediately. Gelato melts quickly and the warmth of the espresso leaves you with a slurpy mess only minutes in. I caught my waitress in time but she seemed annoyed and nervous about having to leave me the little espresso cup. Should I have made my preference earlier? Maybe if they wanted to take away my choice, they could've just brought the affogato over pre-done. Problem solved. I ended up having yet another awkward encounter after the gelato flavour fiasco, making things even worse for both parties. Eventually she noticed I finished blending my espresso in, so she did come by to pick up the cup - but there was no rush, and looking around, I was the only one to order an affogato anyway out of about 20 patrons...the espresso was weak and watery, I guess suited for a more Asian taste. 

My party of 8 ordered gelato tea floats, a cappuccino, tiramisu, cheesecake, and scoops of gelato. The tea float was interesting, served cold with a choice of about a handful teas - green, lavender, rose, oolong, etc. and a choice(!) of about a handful gelatos as well. They're served with ice and the ball of gelato floating happily atop a medium soda drink glass like you would get at a casual restaurant/diner. After mixing it altogether, it resembled a diluted cold tea latte. I can see promise in finding the perfect combination, but personally I'm not a fan of tea lattes hot or cold. The cappuccino looked pretty good, and the gelato was very well received. Fruity flavours were raved to be very interesting and refreshing, while savoury flavours were strong and looked rich. The balls of gelato are comparable to a full scoop of ice cream from Baskin Robbins or Marble Slab, just perfectly rounded...it was good to see they were a decent size.

Overall, there was interesting stuff on the menu and the Friday night was a full house almost all night from 10:30pm until close at 1:00am. I would return (very) occasionally for gelato - if not for the great gelato flavours I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I went here for dessert with my husband. He ordered the cheese cake soufflé and I ordered the assorted macaroons. Both items were very tasty. The service was good but waiting for a spot took forever, and they kinda forgot about us... There were a lot of people sitting there finished eating but were so Inconsiderate towards the people waiting for their turn to sit... although it was worth it!!! Prices were very reasonable and it's open till midnight which is a plus for all the late night sweet cravers. Macarons were yummy for sure... Obviously not the butter avenue quality but definitely worth going for if you cannot head to downtown. My husband said the cheesecake soufflé was AAAAMAZING... It was freshly baked at the moment. 
Must go !!"}
{"text":"3.5/5

Good crepes, okay gelato and good tiramisu in a trendy atmosphere.  

It's a dessert cafe with an Asian twist in a very Asian plaza (beside chakos)

The atmosphere is great, they're open late, it's affordable. I had the Lindt crepe and added strawberries and bananas as an add on--/ they were very generous with the amount of fruit they put in my crepe. I sampled the tiramisu and Panna cota which were decent enough. Probably not authentic Italian but it's good!

I'd come here again for a late night dessert craving in Scarborough/ Markham!  The cheesecake was a meh - but come by for crepes, tea and coffee!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and mood of the cafe, crepes were delicious! - very cheap, great date spot."}
{"text":"This place gives me a very \"winter, sitting by the fireplace\" feel of the surrounding. The place is also surrounded by either artwork or dessert products you can purchase. It's definitely a smaller restaurant, so expect a mild wait if you go during rush hour. 

I ordered the regular Creme Brulee and this Set with 12 scoops of gelato, chocolate fondue, nuts, fruits, macarons. The creme brulee was really good! Decent sized as well. What I really enjoyed though, was the big set of gelato and etc. There was so much! (It also costed $30). I think it was a good split between 3 people. I found it more of an entertaining dish as it was basically fondue. There were so many different flavors as well - so it really gave me a chance to try them all!

Service was good - they got quite busy at one point during the evening, but still helped us out in filling our water and assisting us. 0109's menu is also larger than it was when it first opened. So I definitely would recommend more trips to try the food out."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group. I got the Lava cake, a cappucino, and a smoked salmon crepe. The smoked salmon crepe was probably what lowered the overall rating for me. I was expecting a few slices of real smoked salmon, but instead got smoked salmon flavoured cream cheese. It was quite odd, and I wasn't too fond of it. In addition, the lava cake was still a bit too sweet for me. In fact, I think I prefer the chocolate fondant from Beard Papa at Pmall more than this (mind you I haven't had beard papa in a long time, so I don't know if it's still comparable). Furthermore, the cappucino was only alright with fake latte art. By this, I mean they just had milk foam and then stenciled designs on top with choco powder as opposed to relying solely on the milk foam to create the art. 

Overall I feel this place is ok. I haven't tried any of their truffles yet though, and I do intend on coming back for them eventually. Also I had a bite of my friend's green tea creme brulee and it was pretty good! Hopefully I can update my review with a better rating upon my next visit."}
{"text":"Tried the mango supreme and chocolate & hazelnut mousse. Mango supreme was really good however, the mousse was ordinary. Their serving sizes are small as well. I wouldn't call them overpriced but not reasonably price either compared to their competitors.  service was quick & staff was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"More on the pricey side, serves western and Chinese desserts. 
Order the chocolate fondu, 
Came with 12 different gelato that are house made. 
I would say get this if you have 3 people or more as the amount of gelato for 2 people is way too much. On top of that you have fruits and macarons. Price tag is about 39.99 I think which is pretty over priced. 
Came here for cakes and coffee before which was still pretty pricey as the cake itself is pretty small"}
{"text":"This spot has a nice atmosphere with good dessert but service here is not so great. The cheesecakes are really creamy and the flavours are really good. Probably the only thing I would go for. The floral waffle is good too but very overpriced for waffle, a scoop of ice cream, and a little fruit. They have a combo that is meant for sharing which includes 12 scoops of ice cream, a little bit of fruit, a few macaroons, chocolate sauce, and nuts. They don't let you choose the ice cream flavours which is so stupid because we didn't finish half of the ice cream because we didn't like it. Everyone has to order something because there is a minimum charge. I went with 4 other people thinking just getting the combo would be enough to share which it was. They told us the combo would only exempt 2 people from getting charged the minimum fee and we have to order more or get charged. Not a great place to go if you aren't too hungry and you just wanted something small to share. The desserts are okay though. Only recommend if you are hungry and it is close to your area. Not worth a long drive."}
{"text":"my mouth has never experienced such pleasure. the salted peanut butter Gelato is mind blowingly amazing, the birthday cake was also so good. the crepes are pretty basic to be honest but this place is so worth checking out for the Gelato. whatever you do make sure you order the peanut butter!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the eatery is very much like a modern cafe or lounge; pretty comfortable as well, with a moderate loudness level.

The menu had many desserts/chocolate selection, and they offer decent fixed sets!  My friend and I decided to try the set that comes with 12 scoops of different gelato flavours, 4 macarons, sliced bananas, sliced strawberries, and grapes!

The server was really thoughtful and asked us if it was our first time, we said yes; she then proceeded to explain to us of how to properly eat it and fully enjoy it.

The flavours were decent to good except for two that I didn't really like, which was coconut and sesame.
Overall, this eatery is cute and has good gelato!"}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed with their selection of desserts. I went in on a weekday in the evening. Service was slow even with the place more than half empty. They definitely not the best place for a snack but okay for some sweets. Interior was clean and decently quiet. Wish the service was a little better tbh."}
{"text":"'Okay'. Thats the general feeling I had overall for the experience. 

They had a large variety of choices, ranging from tradition Chinese desserts to gelato and cheesecake. Our table ended up getting lots of things, but a friend and I shared the fondue set with a friend. 

Had about 12 different flavours, grapes, strawberries, bananas and macarons in the fondue set, which was really nice since we wanted to try many different flavours. The chocolate fondue was a bit too coconut for my liking, and the macarons were definitely not the right consistency. Each flavour of gelato was pretty good, but some were just not to my personal liking and taste. Excellent for someone who wants to try many different flavours, but not really worth it at $30. 

Other things our table got were the lava cake, cheesecakes, and panna cotta. Friends said everything was 'okay'. 

The worst part was the service. Other than getting seated quickly, it took hard work just to get the server's attention. Needed to ask 3-4 times just to get more water into our cups. If you don't want your customers to keep asking, give them bigger cups!!! Actually started getting annoyed by the end of the night...

Have no intention of coming back, as it was horrible service and way overpriced."}
{"text":"I brought my parents here and they gave me great service. Their seats were very comfy and they had a large variety of food and drinks. Their food and drinks were also not bad. Would come again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my match red bean lava cake and black sesame gelato. The gelato in particular was so good. I still think about it. Will definitely be back. However, the place is a bit small and get pretty crowded and loud because of all the chatter. I went on a weeknight and it was difficult to have a conversation at first but after awhile, tables started clearing and it was the perfect catch up place I kinda imagined it to be. Looking forward to trying some of their other goodies in the cafe!"}
{"text":"Theyre open late and have an extensive menu-- half of which seemed to be unavailable.
We had to go through 4 different meal items before we heard \"oh yes we do have that one today\"
However, food was good! I wouldn't say incredible, but definitely good. Lava cake could have been more moist, matcha cheesecake was very powerfully flavoured.
Creme brulee was delicious as was the chocolate cheesecake! 
I wouldn't deter someone from going but I don't think I would recommend on my \"must go\" list
All around, it was just good."}
{"text":"I have a major sweet tooth and coming to 0109 Dessert & Chocolate for dessert always makes my day. First off, while this cozy dessert shop is on the higher price range (almost $20/ person), the food makes up for it. 

We ordered the Gelato fondue and it was probably one of the best dessert dish concepts I've ever had.  We were provided with a large assortment of scoops of their different freshly made gelato and I was blown away by the range of flavours that they had. The highlight was dipping their gelato into the warm chocolate as the chocolate would harden and create a delicious crunchy shell around the gelato. We also ordered the Lava Cake which was also quite tasty but nothing exceptional. 

Overall, I would recommend visiting this cute dessert shop just to try their gelato fondue."}
{"text":"The first thing that I noticed about 0109 Dessert & Chocolate was that it was so homey and cozy inside.  It smelled deliciously of chocolate throughout the shop and the warm interior reminded me of Christmas.  This was a great place for a romantic dessert date or holiday celebrations.  I really loved the atmosphere in there.

The Lava Cake was intensely rich with chocolate inside and outside.  The chocolate \"lava\" that spilled out was so dense and decadent!  I needed help finishing it since it was so rich.  The chocolate gelato was also very rich and smooth; it actually had chunks of chocolate in it!  A total chocolate overload."}
{"text":"Dine in cafe and opens late. Lot of selections and drinks to choose. Try the durian cheese cake. It is delicious."}
{"text":"Went there with family and got the floral waffle although it's not floral anymore... Still delish....I gotta say the green apple gelato was surprisingly awesome and the lava cake is on point.   Great service although I will say the rule regarding matching the number of items by the number of patrons is odd and a little cheap. Still good though."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday back in June. It wasn't busy and the customer service was great. I ordered the green tea cheesecake and birthday cake gelato. I was surprised that the desserts weren't that sweet which I really liked."}
{"text":"I've been to this place around 4-5 times. They changed the menu after around the third time I went which was kind of disappointing as the prices increased. I've had the green tea creme brulee, matcha latte and strawberries and banana crêpe. 


Creme brulee - So delicious! You can really taste the green tea. It has a mousse like filling rather than the typical custard. 

Matcha latte - not bad, frothy milk with a bitter green tea taste. Wouldn't order again. 


Crepe - Has a really authentic, yummy taste. The strawberries and banana go really well with the lindt chocolate. However, we had to wait almost 20mins for the crepe to come, which is disappointing. 

Overall, it is a bit overpriced but they don't skimp on quality for the items I've tried."}
{"text":"Came here on a friend's recommendation. Walked through the door and thought to myself, \"pretty cozy here!\" The decor was quite modern with lots of pictures of different destinations (quite nice).

Me, I'm no dessert guy.. But I'm willing to try different things. We had the coconut creme BruceLee (brulee lol), strawberry crepe w/ ice cream + fruits, cappuccino creme brulee and a chinese dessert (walnut?). They were all very good, but the cappuccino creme brulee was way too strong. - couldn't taste anything but the cap. The coconut creme brulee was, IMHO, the best of the four.

I highly recommend the coconut if you come here!

3.5 + .5 being close to home! :P"}
{"text":"based on personal experience: 
Pros: 
wide variety of choices on the menu. 
nice and cute dessert place for small group gathering 

Cons:
- service wasn't to good because the server(s) were a little slow 
-expected customers to tell them before hand about allergies. they do not ask if we do have allergies or even tell customers that specific dishes serves with nuts or anything in general (when we order, did not provide the information that the dish comes with dessert), expecting us to know just by looking at the pictures that the dessert contain nuts (it look like chocolate not nuts). My friend had a minor reaction. 
-even when it was brought up, they did not provide a good solution besides telling us that we should've told them we have allergies instead of informing us certain desserts contain items that people may be allergic too. 
-do not like the idea that each customer has to order one thing instead of sharing the plate"}
{"text":"I was overall impressed with this place. 

They have a lot of variety of desserts, and there are some sharing desserts as well. 

Desserts were really tasty. I really liked that you can customize your own crepe with different fillings, toppings and ice creams on the side. They also have unique chocolate truffle flavours to try. Interesting combinations. 

It is on the pricey side, but portions are generous. 

Atmosphere is small and intimate, so it's a good spot for a date. 

I gave it 4 stars because I think it's stil pricey for what they have to offer. Service was a bit slow as well. 

Still, definitely a nice place to try out. I would come back."}
{"text":"lava cake is the best. dark chocolate is very tasty."}
{"text":"Such nice vibe and atmosphere at this place! I loved the cafe-like environment and the chocolate display.

I came here and got the coconut creme brûlée and bf got the chocolate cheesecake with Americano.

The creme brûlée was soooo smooth and too was perfectly torched, the coconut flavour wasn't very strong though. Still, portions were kinda big and I could barely finish it. It was so good.

The chocolate cheesecake was also good but quite dense and rich, it was made with bittersweet chocolate so wasn't too sweet. 

The americano went well with the desserts. The service was friendly and quick. I found this place to be very clean (esp the washroom!) which is a big plus!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. It's super pricey and there was a rule that everyone has to order something. 

It's seriously just gelato (nothing special or memorable about their gelato), an a waffle cone plated nicely on a plate.

The green tea lava cake was very...heavy, and it wasn't that great either. You go in and end up spending $26 on 2 items. 

I would not go again. You can get better dessert at a better price elsewhere."}
{"text":"There isn't a single picture produced here that looks bad lol. When I saw their lava cake pics, (and I am a sucker for lava cakes), I knew I had to try it. Even though there were a ton of menu options, for my first visit (without a doubt), I got their Lava Cake w Chocolate Gelato. Verdict: it was nothing special, though it was well-made and I was satisfied. I think this set could be too sweet for the average person, but I'm a total chocoholic so I was able to tolerate it :p For some reason I expected them to have more lava cake flavours...

3 stars; but +1 for atmosphere!
Presentation is definitely a winner, uniquely decorated with every plate. It complements their atmosphere which I really love: the lighting, theme and soft music really sets the mood. I feel comfortable staying here for a long time. For a place that looks like is run by a couple, I commend them; I would say the café is quite successful! Overpriced a bit, however the atmosphere and friendly service makes up for it (free wifi) - and what looks like a very exciting gelato menu! 

Happy to know I won't have to travel downtown this summer for some unique & exotic flavours, I can stay right here in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"This small, quiet dessert shop is tucked away in the plaza at Midland/McNicoll. It has a charming little vibe, with specialty desserts and pastries.

I wasn't impressed with the crepes. I got the maple syrup sweet crepe. It was just a crepe with maple syrup (duh). You had to add more for toppings. 

This is a decent place if you have a sweet tooth. There's quite a bit of options. Everything is a bit on the pricier end, but presentation is nice."}
{"text":"Great selection of desserts for fair prices. The creme brûlée is a huge portion and really well done. The sugar on top is so crackly and the creme is not overly sweet. 

We also got the macaron plate that's served with a delicious house made chocolate in the shape of the Eiffel Tower. The selection of macarons range from coconut to raspberry to chocolate. They cover all bases from indulgent to fruity. 

Cappuccinos are very well done with a nice, thick, milk foam and the espresso is super tasty. The cappuccino didn't even need any sugar. 

Next time, we will have to try the fondue that has gelato, fruit, and macarons served with Lindt chocolate. 

Service is meh. We weren't served water at any point and the servers lost our tab the first time we went. But we go for the food, not the service."}
{"text":"They make their own desserts here. So some may take a while. Example: molten lava cake (both the dark chocolate one and the matcha one were good). They serve both chinese desserts like the mango sago dessert and western desserts like crepes. Extensive long menu (not shown on their website).

Their menu prices are a bit high for the small dessert items. The cheapest thing was the smores condensed milk toast which was decent sized. I also like browsing around their glass panel of chocolates including this cool shoe shaped one.

Service here was a bit lacking. Barely refilled our waters and when we tried to share an item that would still bring us over their minimum charge per person, it wasn't allowed. Apparently it is one per person. How would you be able to eat the large gelato fondue platter yourself? It includes 12 gelato scoops, macarons, and fruits with fondue. I would like to try that in the future if I can share."}
{"text":"Quality of the desserts here are very good. It's a nice modern spacious cafe which is nice for dates and catching up with friends. They don't blast their music like other cafes that are full of teenagers. 

Love their durian gelato, but deeply sadden that you can only order it in the durian supreme...can't order the scoops individually...or add another scoop to the supreme. Don't get me wrong, the durian supreme was really good too but when you want that durian fix, one scoop isn't enough."}
{"text":"Food is alright. For waffles their prices somewhat match demetres when theyre not on that level yet. Still feels like I should be getting more than what I'm paying for. But nonetheless the service was good and the waitresses were very well mannered."}
{"text":"A great spot for a date night! If you love chocolate then this is the place to be. My partner ordered a chocolate crepe with nutella and an iced hot cocoa. I had the cinnamon crepe with salted caramel gelatto and hot apple cider. 
Having a nice glass of water brought over without asking is a considerate touch. Prices reflect the quality. ..you get hand made dishes here. You can see the open kitchen which is nice and clean for such a busy place. 
Don't get a rich drink and a rich dessert. ..it's too much...your tummy might suffer a bit. 
The hand made chocolate is wonderful to take home as a gift...they make impressive tokens."}
{"text":"We came here for dessert on a Friday. The place itself was relatively busy but your wait for a table won't be too long. It also accommodates for groups pretty well.   

One great thing about this place is that it makes its own gelato. I tried the passion fruit, mixed berry, lemon, cappuccino and black sesame gelato. I loved the lemon, passion fruit and mixed berry gelato. The cappuccino and black sesame gelato were okay but didn't really go well with the fruitier gelato. If you are getting gelato here, I'd recommend going fruity.  

In terms of what I didn't like, the place has a policy where each person has to order one item on the menu. We were going to order the larger meal that came with macarons, gelato and fondue but only two people could split this dish even though it is a meal for 3+ people. As a result, I ended up splitting the four gelato dessert with a friend. The restaurant also charges $1 surcharge if you want to change your gelato flavour to something other than vanilla in your affogato  Also, bring cash... They don't take credit. I would probably only return if I was in the area and craving gelato."}
{"text":"0109 is a very spacious and dim lighted dessert place that serves desserts of all kinds: waffles, gelato, chocolate, crepes, creme brulee, macarons, lava cake, cheesecake, etc. 

Coming in on a Friday night, this dessert place was packed, but still managed to have one seat, and enough seats so that customers only have to wait for 5 minutes or so. The staff were super polite and greeted us right away. Water here was slightly warm - I'm assuming it's tap water, but warm water tasted a little funny. I think I prefer it if it was completely cold, room temperature or hot.

For the food, everyone needs to order one item (from their one item policy), unless you get the $30 gelato, macaron and fruits with chocolate fondue (their specialty). We weren't too hungry and just tried their normal dessert, which I might like to add, was pretty expensive compared to other dessert places, also considering the quality and size of the food. The size of most portions were served on a big plate with food the size of a rice bowl for about $10 each.

We ordered, their lava cake (~$7 - $8) which was a chocolate cake with rich chocolate lava and a scoop of vanilla ice cream/ gelato sprinkled with cocoa powder. The chocolate cake tasted pretty good, despite the size and was very rich in chocolate. However when I had the vanilla ice cream/gelato (which I was supposed to eat with this cake), it tasted like a the plan ice cream (not even one of the more delicious chewy kinds, so I didn't think it tasted like gelato). I'm a huge fan of ice cream and macarons, so I'm super picky, even when it comes as a side. This meal took 15 minutes to make, and it was nice that they told us in advance

The marshmallow toast (~$5 - $6) was served with the lava cake. The waitress was nice and asked ahead of time if we wanted it to be served together. The marshmallow toast had fluffy marshmallows on top of a Nutella spread on thick toast. It was served nice and hot, so the first few bites were delicious, but after a while, it got cold fairly fast and the marshmallows were super chewy and harder to cut. It tasted like a soft smore and who doesn't love smores?!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came to this cafe last night for some dessert. It was about 9 of us. There was a little bit of a struggle with accommodations/seating, but we managed to push together a few tables to make space for the entire group. At first, I was excited to have some yummy dessert, but it went downhill quite quickly.

Service: Not too good. After 20 minutes of waiting after being seated, I had to wave down the server to come take our order. Just a warning that every single person in the group at your table will have to order something, meaning no sharing. What?!!! Anyways, after we were done ordering, I asked the server for water for the table, and she only brought it for a couple people (not including the person who asked her-me!). Most of our group ordered a gelato, or pre-made cake, or a beverage. And boy did it take them long to prepare such simple orders. We waited for our order (a crepe) for a half hour. Moreover, everyone's order was coming out sporadically. There was a break of 15 minutes from when the first order arrived and the last order.

Food: Mediocre for what you're paying. Our crepe was good but we paid $15 for it (that included some fruits, chocolate sauce, and only one scoop of gelato)! You can get the same crepe for under $12 elsewhere. I understand that this cafe makes its own chocolate, but come on! We didn't think this was some fancy restaurant and did not expect the prices we had to pay. One gelato scoop was $4.5, which is okay, but they were so stingy with the scoop.Most places provide two scoops for that price. What a rip off! Also, the gelatos and cafe beverages were just okay. The no-bake cake was absolutely disgusting. Do not order any of them.

Overall: Would not return here. Average food, service, and experience for high prices. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Summary: I confess I don't have much of a sweet tooth to begin with, but experiences where they literally ignore my allergies? Yeah, that'll get you a one star.

(Full disclosure: this review is 100% based on service, since I wasn't actually able to eat what was served to me.)

I came here with a friend on a decently busy weekend. Got seated and read the menu.

Fact: I have some dietary restrictions. At dessert places, they're usually really good about explaining to me what I can and can't eat. I waved the server over and inquired about some items. I had a bad feeling when the server showed she had less knowledge about the food items than I had about quantum space physics. 

After explaining that I would be very sick if these items had certain ingredients, and trying my darn hardest to clarify... We ordered.

And after a disgustingly long wait time, out pop the items... Layered with... You guessed it, things I was allergic to.

I was sure, certainly positive, absolutely confident, that this was a mistake.

Waved them over. Said, \"hey, excuse me, I think the order is wrong...? I specifically mentioned I couldn't eat...\"

Blank stare. 

Right. Let me try that again. \"I will be sick, verrrry sick, if I eat this. I would not order this if I knew what was on it. I ASKED you if it was on this...\"

Blank stare. Denial.

No apology, no offer for alternatives, nothing. 

I mean, I know Asian dessert spots aren't always friendly to those who have dietary restrictions, but this was bad even by comparison.

Listen, the Midland McNicoll plaza is one of my favourites. It's highlighted by the mainstays of 24 hour noodles (Magic), the unlimited noodles (hey noodle), curry (Malaysian), meat (Chako) and bubbletea, so it  conflicts me to rate something there so low. But I owe it to myself to by honest, and the honest truth is, I'd feel sick walking back in again. You got options in that plaza. If you have allergies, this ain't one of them."}
{"text":"Loved the cream brûlée (original) but the latte was a bit over priced and they only filed up 80% of the cup more expensive than Starbucks and for sure The latte at Starbucks tastes better. The Serradura I ordered was mango flavored and it tasted awful. Too sweet, too hard and very little mango flavor."}
{"text":"Wouldn't expect a chocolate Cafe to be in this plaza. They even had that chocolate turning machine and tons of chocolate for sale. They have a wide variety of desserts and they were all pretty damn good. It's clean and service was great. I Would def come back here. Loved the toast with the roasted marshmallows and Nutella. The crepe filling has a variety of filling you can choose from even Lindt chocolate. Yum!"}
{"text":"The space is really cozy. They make fresh truffle everyday.

We went there on Saturday afternoon. And we got green tea cheesecake and strawberry cheesecake. Both are really good, creamy and not too sweet.

Plus you can sit there for a long time, the staff won't rush you even you finish the dessert. 

The staffs are really friendly as well.

We will go there again for sure."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to go out at all for Valentines Day, but dinner with my parents and then a post-dinner dessert treat with my mother while my father plays badminton doesn't hurt either. There were definitely a good number of couples here taking selfies and eating dessert, but there were also groups of non-couples.

After we got seated, I walked over to their chocolate display to take a look. Immediately, one of the waitresses launched into a description of all their Valentines chocolate, even after I said I was just looking. I suppose she didn't hear me, because at the end of her spiel, she asked me who I was looking to purchase chocolate for, and I told her I was just taking a look, and she left me alone. I suppose next time, I'll be more adamant about my browsing. It was nice of her though, and they do have some very funky truffle flavors like wasabi. If I were into chocolate, I'd be more interested in trying some. They are very pretty. They also have a chocolate shaped like the millenium falcon? Also a lego man. Cute stuff.

Their desserts are on the pricier side, but cafe desserts tend to be, so this isn't very surprising. However, 0109 does put effort into making sure the little details come out right. 

My mom had the strawberry and chocolate panna cotta ($5.95?). I expected it to be about the size of a choco pie, but it came in a long sundae-style glass, topped with real strawberry puree, and covered in solid chocolate crisscrosses. It was a very generous portion for the price. It wasn't too sweet, which we liked. I would be willing to order some of their other panna cotta flavors (passionfruit, anyone?). 

I had their durian cheesecake ($6.95). Um. Yeah. Limited availability, but they had it today. This one was slightly larger than a chocopie, and square. It was topped with a few crunchy decorative balls of something...Yeah. I really don't know what they were. Ooh. There was a pretty, solid chocolate treble clef on it too! Then there was chocolate and strawberry(?) sauce on the plate. I didn't know whether the flavors would work, durian and cheesecake, but surprisingly, they did. The durian flavor was distinct, and so was the cheesecake flavor. The more I ate it though, the less durian flavor I could detect, and the more prominent the cheesecake flavor. The durian flavor came from real durian. I found bits of durian pulp in my cheesecake. The base of the cheesecake had black sesame in it, but it did absolutely squat against the flavors of the durian and the cheesecake. The chocolate sauce did compliment the durian and cheesecake flavors quite nicely though. I would order this again, but perhaps to share with someone. It isn't a large portion, but the cheesecake is quite dense.

I'm pleased we came to try 0109. I had my reservations before, but this experience was quite pleasant."}
{"text":"The most lit gelato I've ever had. The salted peanut butter was my favorite. Definitely coming back for more"}
{"text":"Very cute and definitely has that date atmosphere down. I like how spacious it is, but def would benefit from having a cozy area or unique areas to sit. Oh look, I'm thinking of The Alley at Warden XD

I've been here multiple times and I have to say I love their 3-cheese Himalayan pink salt cheesecake. Texture was consistent and the crust was not sawdust. The candied fruit (a term I learned one night while here) was a nice balance from the savoury taste of the cheesecake.

My dinner date had this royal mille crêpe served with vanilla ice cream. The look is a little bland but I have to say it was tasty. It came out warm and just made me feel wonderful when I had it.

Pretty nice portions, actually. The Himalayan was so good I had it twice.

So why deduct a star? Because their decor could have been more romantic and promoted a more intimate atmosphere. I'd still come back."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now for desserts.  It's pretty good overall but it's somewhat pricy for an asian place. I may return.

Food: 4/5, I've gotten the macaron plate as well as the gelato trio.  The macaron plate was actually very good: the best one was the passion fruit one.  The trio with tapioca was just ok. It comes with green apple, coconut and mango gelatos; nothing special.

Service: 2/5, there isn't much service really.  They need to hire more people. They are swamped and you really have to get their attention for anything.  

Ambience: 2/5, nice tables and chairs but it can get really loud and may not be the best to just hang with friends for conversations.

Price: 2/5, the biggest downfall of this place is that it's only cash or debit only.  The dessert dishes are around $15 per person which can be seen as pricy versus what you can get elsewhere for similar stuff."}
{"text":"Vegans and the dairy intolerant beware: no sorbet options here! All the gelatos are dairy based, even the fruit ones. All of the fruit gelatos are low calorie and fat free except for the banana flavor. There is also a low sugar option for gelatos.

Interesting selection of caffeinated drinks, gelatos, cheesecakes, chocolates, waffles, and sweet and savory crepes. They also have a large selection of individual Lindt chocolates for sale up front in gift boxes or individually. 

The tiramisu was OK, more bitter than sweet, which is a wonderful find. It contains rum however and my friend said she could feel it towards the end, so maybe don't order this for children. The durian cheesecake was indeed so stinky! The smell is so strong, but tastes so yummy. My maple syrup sweet crepe was pretty standard, except I didn't realize that $5.50 did not include any fillings! To get any filling, you must add at least $1. I chose mixed berries for an additional $2. Best part of these crepes was that they don't add a lot of syrup or chocolate sauces inside the crepe, so the fruit flavors are still present and overall not that unhealthy.

Value is 3/5. Kind of pricy IMO. Entree sized platters are around $14 and not that large. Only debit and cash are accepted. They don't split bills.

Free WiFi is available. Also plenty of free parking at the plaza right in front. Best part is that they are open pretty late and open even on Canada day."}
{"text":"Came here way back with Ryan H. + a few others so the experience was pretty much the same. I thought I would give it a quick rating though since I've been slacking on so many places. 0109 is really nice inside with a decorative wall of desserts and it seems so.. fancy.

The way this place presented their desserts in the menu was impressive and truly, I wanted everything. Macarons? That's my shizz. Durian? Cheesecake? All in one? Drool worthy, correct?! NOPE NOPE NOPE. I had made my mind that I wanted the durian cheesecake but when it came, I knew I would have regrets. One bite was way too sweet and the durian was not potent at all- it was so sweet to the point where I barely finished half of it and ended up tossing the rest (hey, none of my friends like durian.. it's a miracle they still sat with me) The cheesecake is served in a small square shape for around $8, I believe. What a waste it was when I realized I would take no more than 5 tiny bites! Friends had the different desserts and none of them impressed me. The macaron/fondue/ice cream thing for $30ish is definitely instagram worthy but $30+ for macarons without the 'macaron chewiness' and plain ol' ice cream that's supposed to be 'gelato'? Nah b. I ain't about it. The lava cake and all that were alright.. certainly nothing brag worthy.

Service made me want to vomit. The server did not acknowledge us or respond even after we called her numerous times. I was so done with it that I ended up snapping at her \"excuse me. We need water.\" and she still did not seem too motivated. What's wrong with you? I definitely left her one of those 'you've been yelped' cards after we paid. I still tipped because I'm not a complete asshole. 

I went home disappointed, only to have a sore throat from the sweet durian cheesecake for about a week. So technically, I paid to have shitty service, shitty desserts and a shittier week with a raspy cough."}
{"text":"This place for dessert is not that bad. I would recommend getting the crepes which they are known for. I tried out the Chinese desserts for the first time and they were average. I probably wouldn't order that again. 
Pros: service was great and there's a wide selection of desserts to choose from. You can get sweet or savoury items which is a plus. Also a great place to catch up with friends because there's enough seating.
Cons:  A little over priced for something plain."}
{"text":"Melting chocolate in a hot cup of milk sounds good in concept but in reality it just leaves clumps of chocolate at the bottom of your cup, which is not fun. 

For those with a dietary restriction: there was no alternative plant based milk available. Not even lactose free. Just for this I have to knock my review down one star."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and have always had an enjoyable experience at 0109. This is a great place to relax, and enjoy dessert! 

The first thing that pops out is the ambience of the place; it looks rustic and wholesome with the wooden tables/look and the painting on the walls. I am super impressed with the place. Their menu is also great with many delicious things to choose from, with some unique selections. Nothing is mind-blowing but everything I tried tasted good. They use all natural ingredients which is a huge plus. 

This time I got the matcha green tea red bean lava cake with lemon gelato. There's a 15 minute wait for the lava cake. The cake was nice and warm with a great tasting red bean filling inside and a fluffy green tea exterior. Nothing is overly sweet which is the way I like my desserts. 

My friends got the durian gelato float, and chocolate lava cake which are both great. You can never go wrong with the chocolate lava cake if you like chocolate. The durian dessert was actually good. I am not the biggest durian fan but my friend and I (who tried durian for the first time) both agreed we would get it again. 

They also have a a great selection for their gelato to choose from; I have tried the green tea, mint and chocolate chip, and lemon and they were all great. 

Service was great, our waitress was nice, attentive and refilled our water many times. No one there was in a rush to make us leave (we stayed a couple of minutes past midnight/closing) and we were greeted goodbye and thanks.

There's also a 10% discount for arriving later in the day! How sweet is that? :P"}
{"text":"0109 a very spacious cafe with a low-lit ambience with polite staff. It's a very popular spot for late night desserts. I can see why because of the unique selection of desserts they make. There's even a section to purchase really cute truffles and ornamental chocolate. Most to least favourite desserts ordered:

Lava Cake ~$6 the bitter chocolate that oozes out tastes extremely good. served with an option of either vanilla or chocolate gelato. my favourite dessert from here.

Melting Heart Hot Chocolate ~$5 the sweetness level can be customized, as well as the type of stir-stick chocolate used. The chocolate heart is dipped into the foaming milk and is supposed to melt, forming the ultimate diy Lindt hot chocolate.

Coconut Creme Brûlée~ (forgot the price) you can't really go wrong with creme brûlée :) it was flavourful and not too overwhelming in egg-iness.

Durian Cheesecake ~$8 rich in durian and creaminess. has pearls on one corner and a protruding chocolate piece on another

Dark Chocolate Bowl with Mango Mousse & Roasted/Salted Pistachio ~$8 the portion is small but it is an intricately put together dessert. Tastes work well together

Most of the portions are small and plated out on a huge plate, but are artistically presented with powder or sauce to fill up the space. Also, if you have any allergies, let them know. I got a mild one with a dessert that I didn't expect to, so be careful. I'll definitely come back to try out more items on the menu! :)

Update: I came back again to try more things on the menu and here are my thoughts

Vanilla Creme Brulee - it wasn't as good as the coconut creme brulee this time it had more of a spongy dry with texture with a very delicately flamed surface. I didn't know whether they are there forgot the vanilla flavoring or it was supposed to be this neutral in taste but it was not very sweet. 

Gelato assorted flavors ~$15 there were a lot of interesting and unique flavors to choose from and I picked pomegranate (tasted like one) , lemon (like minute maid) , green apple(like the jolly rancher) , and sea salt caramel (like wethers caramel candy) all of them were amazing and this is  my new favorite dessert at this place"}
{"text":"I loved the desserts here! 

Everything is presented beautifully (hello, macarons and a mini chocolate Eiffel tower?!), and also tastes delicious too.

I think my favourite was probably the green tea lava cake; the matcha flavour was strong, and it paired perfectly with some ice cream. 

I may have overordered on the desserts, but everything looked too good on the menu. Can't wait to be back and try other items! The place itself is a little desserted, but service was friendly."}
{"text":"Usually quite packed on a weekend night, the wait is usually less than 10 minutes though. It a cute cafe in the area which there is none really. I like their open kitchen where you can see the staff work and their cool light contraption above. The display case of chocolate also look very beautiful. 

The first time I got a crepe with their ice cream and fruits, nothing too special. However they do have a large selection of flavours to choose from. Their smore's toast is pretty good, the torched marshmallows are fun and it becomes a gooey super sweet mess. However I feel like their prices are on the high side for the quality of food. I never really leave fully satisfied and always a bit mediocre. But its a good option to have in the area but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Came in a group of 5. 
We made a big order, but they still insisted everybody had to their own individual order. Isnt a big deal, but i think its a dumb policy so thus earned them 4 stars. 

Food was okay. Ive had better. Prices are decent. 
Service was okay, They are not understaffed, the place is very clean and tidy - good for dates, lighting and setting is somewhat romantic. 

Will return (with intent to order something)."}
{"text":"How delicious this place is! Loved the environment, the cleanliness and the service. We got the molten lava cake and condense milk marshmallow toast and they were both very delicious . Loved that their ice cream was gelato and it gave a softer texture taste to the cake. Service was very friendly and they paid attention when we needed water etc. Coffee was brewed right and loved how they had their own treats for reasonable prices. The desserts are a bit above avg but it's seems like they are devoted to the quality of it. The only thing that I didn't like was that they didn't have outlets for laptops, phone etc."}
{"text":"It took us so long to choose what to order as their menu is very extensive. Each person has to order at least one item. We got a waffle topped with fruits and matcha icecream and green tea. The waffle was huge but half of the topping was whipped cream. Matcha ice cream didn't have that much of matcha flavor. There was nothing special about the waffle. It was photogenic for sure. 

As we were eating, we were talking about coming back to try other stuff until I saw the couple eating in the kitchen (it is an open kitchen so people can see what is going on). They were slurping noodles from the bowl at the same counter where they prepare desserts. Wish I hadn't seen it, but oh well, good to know that they are not that professional. I won't be back to this place for this reason. There are so many other (and better) dessert places I can go in GTA."}
{"text":"Good service.  A bit over-priced for what they serve.  Still a decent lil' place after a meal elsewhere.  When we were there, only a few tables were occupied.  It gets busier as the evening progresses.  Oh yeah...No credit cards are accepted.  Only cash or debit."}
{"text":"Very nice place to hangout with friends! Good service, good atmosphere and clean. I ordered Mango Supreme and it's very good. They also sell some chocolate in animal or cartoon shape."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this hidden gem in the middle of Scarborough. Their signature hot chocolate with a choice of chocolates were phenomenal.

We ordered their other signature dish of chocolates fondue. While the presentation was nice, there were two things they need to fix: 1) their macaroon was subpar. It was soft and stale. 2) the quality of their gelato was not up to standard either. The green Apple flavor tasted artificial. The blue flavored ice cream was unknown. Their sweet crepes was on par with market but nothing special."}
{"text":"Like.. I still love their menu items but man are they getting a little too full of themselves as the time passes.

They \"readjusted\" their prices = increased their prices by quite a bit on some items.

They have never taken credit and still don't, I don't know why.

Now to add to all of this, they have introduced a new rule that every person on the table have to order one item, wth? Duude, you guys  are a dessert place, people should be allowed to come and share a a waffle or whatever. That's the whole point of a dessert place.

So first time I go after their menu went through this change, I ordered my usual Lindt crepe with extra Lindt, they charged me for it but there was no extra chocolate.
Their new servers don't understand English very well either, and while that's not a problem in and of itself, if you don't understand something, call somebody who does

In the past two years, I have been to this place many times, probably more than anybody else and it's really sad to see the change in attitude."}
{"text":"Desperately in search of black sesame ice cream, my Yelp app came to the rescue.

Their ice cream is made of pure milk, no cream added which makes it extra healthy.
They've got a cute table display of the flavors they feature, take away chocolate boxes, truffles and cakes which they can bake.  In addition they've got a great selection of ice cream flavors to choose from; birthday cake, salted caramel, black sesame, green tea, Cappuccino, vanilla, pomegranate, mango, etc.  
In house made chocolate ice cream made with Lundy Chocolate and a scoop of black sesame served in their waffle bowls.
The place is spacious, cute, clean with an open concept!"}
{"text":"Good little dessert place. Had the banana strawberry crepe which had the right level of sweetness. My sister had the lava cake which was also very good. 
They have a bunch of other treats that they sell at the store that look very yummy. Next time I will buy a few.
Prices were a little steep for what you get. But as a once in a while treat it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"0109 Dessert and Chocolate (which is named after the unit number it is housed in for whatever imaginative reason) is a decent casual Asian dessert house in a Scarborough plaza overflowing with an abundance of eating and social hangout options (including the anchor tenants Chako and Go For Tea) available deep into the night.

What brought me this far out was rumors of durian cheesecake my durian craving friend heard of. Oh yes, its the newest thing to die for here, it looks freakishly just like the picture on the table, and my friend enjoyed it. The durian taste is light but substantial; it reminded me of a durian ice cream bar.

Sadly for an old friend that's the only thing durian they had right now. But eh, they got a variety of cold treats, crepes, dessert drinks, cakes, and crafty chocolate confections with quite a bit of glazing. The green tea cheesecake had lots of flavour for something I thought was going to be more muted. Fuckin love it; their stuff isn't heavy on sugar, so you're not overbearingly sweet like many gwai-lo desserts. If you go for a gelato float though just know that if you choose a tea for it, it will be so watered down it might as well be a bloody ice cold glass of plain water with a gelato scoop floating on it.

The place is kinda fruity for me, the confections a tad pricey (its easy to pull $15-20/person for a bite and a drink), and the service is adequate for a business that gets packed quickly deep into the night. It serves its purpose well as a popular hangout spot for the area, be it a date night or a bunch of friends.

{TTC: 42A/B or 57 bus to McNicoll/Midland, at the NW corner with the Go For Tea, it's in the same plaza, tucked near Chako. Prepare for potential parking hell.}"}
{"text":"Underwhelming is what I would say regarding 0109 Dessert & Chocolate.

Our party of 10 descended here and were seated promptly on a late Saturday evening.

At my end of the table, we ordered the fondue set, a chocolate bowl with green tea cream, and one of us had a hot beverage.

The fondue set was just satisfactory, not outstanding. The actual chocolate fondue was runny, and tasted like it was powdered.  On top of it all, it wasn't even warm or hot. Fondue by its nature should be warm when you dip something into it.  The fondue was room temperature, almost cold.  And it did not help that it wasn't thick, it had a watered down consistency.  The toppings for the fondue included sliced bananas, strawberries, green grapes, chopped nuts, small bite sized macarons and an assorted varieties of gelato.  The gelato overall, all of it tasted good, is also enough for two people to share.  

We actually wanted to order the chocolate bowl with another topping, but they were out of everything else but the green tea and yogurt with the chocolate bowl. Disappointing for a Saturday evening, we had to settle for the green tea mousse.   The mousse was sweet, but very strong tea aftertaste that hits you hard in the tastebuds.  The chocolate bowl itself was salty with a small hint of sweetness.  I didn't want more than one bite of it due to this fact. To me it reminded me of cheap chocolates I had when I was a kid, but, I know some people out there like salty chocolate. It's just not my thing.  I think the chocolate bowl itself was made in-house?

I can't comment what the rest of the party had but for our end of the table, we all left feeling very underwhelmed and probably won't revisit anytime soon.  We may check it out again if we're in a group and had nowhere else to go or if we don't feel like going to Go For Tea in the same plaza for a post-dinner gathering.

For $30 for their fondue set, I hope they improve it and not water it down - and also add a small candle underneath to keep the fondue hot!"}
{"text":"This place is a really cute cafe with lots of nice décor and a large variety of deserts. My friends and I were in the area so we decided to go in for some ice cream. I got 2 scoops of mint chocolate chip. The ice cream and the cone were delicious but for $4.50 a scoop I probably won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"The desserts here are pretty good, but everything seemed a bit overpriced. And although they seem to try to pretend to be a cute little welcoming cafe-esque space, the girls who were working seemed to want us out ASAP.

The three of us got two orders of flower waffles and a Gelato Affogato. 

We were actually only going to share the two orders of flower waffles, but then we saw the last page menu: minimum of one order per person, max. staying time of 3 hours. 

Food: Flower waffles were pretty good. Both of the ones we ordered were the strawberry banana. One with passionfruit gelato and the other with cappuccino. The presentation of it was impressive, it looked really big, and there was a good fruit to waffle to gelato ratio. And it tasted pretty good too, I mean you can't really go wrong with gelato, waffles, and fruit.

The affogato came with vanilla gelato, and it was okay. It didn't really stand out too much, nor did it didn't really give much of a kick in terms of caffeine. I've had better.

So as I stated above, the maximum sit time is 3 hours, but we came in at around 2:30 pm and sat down for maybe 30-40 mins in total. We weren't rowdy, we were (sadly) mostly on our phones. The girl waiting our table asked us if we were done with our food and wanted to clear our plates when there was still a quarter of one of the waffles there... They walked by very frequently after that, once every few minutes asking if we wanted anything else, so we took the hint and asked for the bill. 

The total came up to $39.50 + tip. The food was okay, but price felt kind of steep for just dessert and a strange atmosphere."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because I heard it was a good place for dessert and gelato.

Unfortunately this is another overtly over priced dessert store/cafe.

We ordered the gelato (which is $4.50 per scoop and $3.75 for the second)

I have had better gelato than this. It's not something to rave about. Was expecting a bit more.

Also ordered the bittersweet cheesecake.
Ummm can I say that it tastes too strong of cream cheese. It's stronger than the tubs of Philadelphia cream cheese you buy in the supermarket. 

Prices are too expensive. 

Also to note:

You must order one item per person

This is something I hate when I go to restaurants.

I just wanted to try desserts and ended up 2 pounds heavier, diabetic and $20 poorer. Would not come back."}
{"text":"There aren't many dessert shops and chocolatiers in Markham/Scarborough area compared to downtown. For lava cakes and crepes, 0109 is one of the few that offers it in this area. I think 0109 is nice for desserts if you live in the area and you want a break from chinese desserts. However, if I lived in another city, I will not come to Markham/Scarborough area for cakes and crepes. 

I came here once when it was really new, it was really long ago. I still remember it was very dark and cozy. But I came back recently and the ambience changed. It is more bright now, looking more casual than before. 

Service: Service was great. Servers were attentive and brought water. It also wasn't very busy so it is easy for servers to keep an eye on all tables. 

Desserts: 

1) Matcha Lava Cake: I was excited to have this. I came on a chilly day and a lava cake was perfect to have on this chilly day. This was very disappointing. The cake was veryy DRY. It was like it was pre-made and then they warmed it up. I had a matcha lava cake before somewhere else at another dessert shop in uptown and it was delicious. But the one here was dry and it wasn't a nice cake in general. The cake also lacks in matcha flavor. I would rate this 2/5

2) Crepe: Lindt chocolate cake with added strawberries and bananas. Plus a scoop of cappuccino gelato. This was decent. I loved the gelato, it stood out from the crepe itself. It had a strong flavor and it was really creamy. I would rate this 3/5

Overall, I am not sure if I would come back for cakes/crepes. Nothing stood out to me to give me a reason to return."}
{"text":"Just had Dinner in the same plaza, and walked by this dessert cafe. So we decided to come in for some dessert and coffee. It's a cute little cafe with nice low light ambiance. They have a small display fridge which is filled with their in house made chocolates. Along the side of the wall they also have their own packed chocolates and treats.

Our menu:

1. Macaron Plate $11.50/6
There was 6 different flavours of macarons on the plate. It also came with a cute little chocolate Eiffel Tower. The texture of the macarons were quite nice. Nice and light and just the right sweetness to it. I especially liked the Coconut & Passionfruit. 
(Flavours: Coffee, Raspberry, Chocolate, Pistachio, Lavender & Apricot, & Coconut & Passionfruit)

I also ordered a Cafe Latte and it came with artwork on top. Taste was so so, a bit watery to my taste. 

2. Durian Cheesecake (Limited Time)
Had to try it lol! Took a small bite from my friend's plate. Very rich durian flavour, texture of the cheesecake was very smooth and velvety! 

Drink was Green Tea Latte. Was lacking sweetness, there was also no sugar pack that came with it. 

3. Gelato Plate
There was Green Apple, Mango & Coconut Gelato with a ice cream waffle cone & tapioca bubbles with crushed nuts. The taste of the gelato was nice and light. My favourite was coconut. But I find that the tapioca garnish was kind of weird, and tasteless with a dash of crushed nuts on top of them.

Overall, it's a nice place to hang with a couple of friends. But now around 8:57pm on a long weekend night, it's quite noisy. :P Maybe I'm getting old ;)"}
{"text":"Verdict's in - 3.5 stars it is!

Ambience: Very urban hipster for a scarborough joint. Beautiful photography all over the walls, even to the washrooms. Makes me wonder who took them and if this person(s) has been to all of these places. 

Menu is pretty extensive. They have English and Chinese desserts. 

Hot chocolate stir - I love this concept! You pick the chocolate you want according to how sweet you want your hot chocolate (they even have spicy hot chocolate). You stir it into a cup of hot foamed milk and vanilla. Takes about 4 minutes to melt the entire chocolate. The drink is super delicious and the foam art is super cute. 4/5

Crepe - You get to build your own crepe. The base price is around $5-$6 and you can add toppings like bananas and strawberries, whipped cream, marshmallow whipped cream, nutella etc for about $1-2. You can also add gelato of your choosing for an additional $4. I got a chocolate strawberry banana crepe with black sesame gelato. The gelato tasted great. The black sesame was very rich in flavour. The crepe itself was okay.... it was kind of soggy and the batter tasted a bit off - not sure what, but it definitely didn't taste the same as Demetre's.  

The music was very soft and calming. There is free wifi and people can bring their laptops and study. Though, there is a 3 hour limit. If the seats were more comfy, I would have definitely given this place a higher rating. Tip: Bring cash or debit card. This place does not accept credit cards, despite looking and feeling like an modern english dessert place!

Overall, I would come back and try their other gelato and hot chocolate, but will forgo the crepes. Another incentive is to find out what 0109 means!"}
{"text":"Tried to come here twice but it was closed so my third attempt was filled with high hopes and expectations. Although we came a little late and close to their closing time, I would say the place is still decently busy. We ordered the housemade gelato fondue with a mango slush. Only the fruit flavoured gelato came with this.

Almost all the gelato flavours that came with the fondue I enjoyed. Refreshing and tastes like what gelato should be. The macarons on the other hand, was disappointing. I'm not sure if they make it in-house or buy it from somewhere, but it was almost stale and all the flavours tasted the same. I'm a huge macaron girl so that made the whole experience unpleasant. 

The staff was friendly, but a little forgetful. The environment was pretty and quiet (maybe the late hours have to do with this), very clean and spacious. I'd probably come back, but not for the fondue and maybe not anytime soon.

Service - 4/5
Food - 3/5
Value - 3/5 
Environment - 4/5

{"text":"I tried 3 items and all were mediocre 
1. Mango Supreme: tastes good with the mixture of Mango chunks and gelato. I could see how this would be appreciated after a spicy dinner. I might try to make it at home. (4/5)
2. Matcha Lava Cake with Coconut Gelato. I'd give the cocnut gelato a 5/5 because it was awesome. The texture was perfect. The Cake though was very dry on the outside and raw in many parts on the inside. The chocolate inside was great. (2.5/5)
3. Spicy hot chocolate. The idea and experience of melting your own chocolate in hot milk was novel to me. However the spicyness was very mild and I've had better ones before. (2.5/5). 
Overall nice place to sit and enjoy subpar dessert."}
{"text":"This place is in the middle of what appears to be a very new strip mall in Scarborough. Upon entering, you are met with the beautiful aroma of melted chocolate, hearing smooth jazz music and greeted warmly by the servers.

The dessert menu is extensive with many types of crème brulee, panna cotta, cheesecakes, crepes (both sweet and savory), hot/cold drinks and waffles. As well, there is a vast selection of homemade truffles.

We began with a waffle, chocolate fantasy and a white hot chocolate. The only thing that I felt was not perfect was that they brought out my hot chocolate and chocolate fantasy about 10 minutes before they brought out the waffle. I wish they had timed things better so that everything arrived at the same time.

Nonetheless, the white hot chocolate was delicious. It's quite obvious that they use some of the best chocolate available, the hot chocolate tastes like a melted white lindt ball. The chocolate fantasy was rich and creamy. When the waffle arrived the two of us were amazed at the size. It is definitely bigger than other dessert places in the area.  We also ordered one of the white chocolate bowls with cappucino mousse filling. The bowl was once again made with the rich, creamy lindt white chocolate. At the end, we also ordered a couple of truffles and that in itself would have me come back. They are so rich and creamy, thicker than the lindt balls available in most stores but still containing the silky taste that we are all familiar with.

Price point is reasonable. Portions are small and it could almost be considered a dessert tapas but everything we tried was delicious. the staff do not rush you out and there is a constant stream of customers as individuals, groups, and families. I would highly encourage anyone to try this place if you are looking for a different place for dessert in the area. I will be back!"}
{"text":"April 25, 2018 - This place has a really nice ambience. I really like the wood aesthetic. 
Lots of variety on the menu - savoury and sweet. The store is very clean. Friendly staff.

Very good gelato- unique flavours- love the earl grey latte (the gelato is freshly made at 0109).

I also love the mixed berry supreme it is one of my favourites..  not too sweet and a bit sour with the berries."}
{"text":"If you like beautiful and creative delicious desserts, try this place! It's a very popular spot so don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table.

Everything I've tried has been very good, from the one-bite chocolate treats to the knife and fork crepes, and the divine gelatos, it was all good! The Mango Supreme is my favourite desert so far. Pictures say a thousand words, so check out my pics! And check out this place!"}
{"text":"Expensive desserts for average taste. Their menu includes a variety of cakes, gelato creations, and other sweet concoctions. I had a green tea cheesecake with green tea gelato and it was decent. What's really cool is their chocolate and truffle selection! They have chocolates shaped in different animals, roses, and popular figures like Hello Kitty and Star Wars characters. They have plenty of different flavoured truffles for a fair price. There are prepackaged chocolate gifts as well. Overall, a quaint, cute chocolate shop, with a pricy dessert menu."}
{"text":"We ordered the gelato fondue. Great value since you get lots of different flavours of gelato which were all pretty good, and there's some fresh fruit and some macarons. However I feel they didn't give us enough fondue and nuts for the amt of gelato and fruit wasn't enough and extra fondue was another 7 dollars (this was 29.95). Their lava cake was kind of disappointment as it was slightly over cooked and did not melt out the way it should. For those who like creams brûlée please don't order it. The custard was bland, they didn't even use vanilla bean in the original flavour and their layer of caramelized sugar is super thin, basically didn't even crack when I hit it with the spoon coz it just gave away. Custard was also not the right texture. Overall the gelato fondue is great but their other desserts so far is okay. (Macarons are alright). Also servers aren't very good at English just FYI, the ones serving us tonight didn't even understand what lactose free milk was and was very impatient when we were asking questions about their menu. Also minimum one order per person so the gelato fondue only counted as two. Ambience and decor is very nice, loud inside though when it's half filled with ppl."}
{"text":"As much as I am attracted because of the location and their menu, I am completely turned off from the fact that customer aren't allowed to take pictures of their menu, apparently it is stated in their menu that no photography was allowed and I was asked to delete the picture I took from their menu, that's quite ridiculous. As much as I wanted to review for this dessert location I kinda lost the need/want to promote much of ur location since I am limited of what I can suggest or post, therefore personal experience is no good.

Anyways, location wise, interior deco and mood is very good for small gathering or dessert date but apparently they also have max seating time of 3hrs according to \"their menu\" which I understand, but do u seriously expect customer to dig through rules? We want pictures and what your restaurant/cafe have to offered instead of checking rules....

I ordered myself a mango panna cotta, I like the fact that it isn't too sweet and the portion wasn't too bad, prices are a bit high but it wouldn't kill me to try it. My friend ordered the royal vanilla crepe, and it was a big too sweet for me since I'm diabetic, however for my friend was ok. 

Additionally, my friend and I each ordered a latte, mine is the roasted coconut and my friend got the rose latte, I love the presentation and flavour wise it's good.

I rated two star because their decor was really good and their dessert wasn't bad either, however they missed the 3 stars because their pricing is high compared to other dessert place which is tastier than here such as duo Patisserie Cafe, or even sweet note?(I think that's the name), staff wasn't friendly and the fact that no pict was allow for their menu just completely turn me off, nonsense in my opinion, but who am i to judge? 

Do I recommend this location? I probably not due to personal experience, however, it's not bad location for dessert if u want to get ur fix of sweetness. I actually took some nice pict, they got nice presentation I would say, so savour it with your eyes first."}
{"text":"I stopped by here yesterday, and ordered macaroons & some chocolates with my boyfriend. Really awesome macaroons! Unfortunately, you're not able to choose which ones you want as it comes in a package. Their chocolates are so cutely & magically shaped and terrifically delicious! I am super impressed by this place and with its cleanliness and ambience. The staff is very nice as well. I will come again and will definitely order something bigger with a couple of friends. Overall, I love this place!

Edit: I came here with a couple of friends and we ordered a lot of desserts here. We really enjoyed it a lot! The Nutella latte was definitely superb. The tiramisu was great! And definitely, my favourite- smores! Though the chocolate hardened up quite a bit later... is it normal? Anyways, other than that. I shall come back!"}
{"text":"This place use to be my go-to dessert restaurant cause of their wide variety and reasonable pricing. They had recently revamped their menu and adjusted their pricing. Now this place is just expensive. I ordered a green tea cheesecake, which I use to get regularly. Now they added gelato to it and raised the price. The cheesecake was dry, chalky, and didn't have any green tea flavour at all. We spoke to the waitress and said we did not want it as the texture and flavour was absolutely disgusting. The waitress just left the cheesecake at our table and when the bill came they did not remove the cheesecake order. We spoke to the waitress and she said the recipe for the cheesecake has not changed so there shouldn't be an issue and they refused to remove the charge. I asked to speak to the manager, but the manager was just hiding in the kitchen and did not come out to speak to me. The waitress came back and said they would offer a \"discount\" for the cheesecake cause I ate some of the gelato.... they wanted to charge me for each tiny piece of fruit I ate and for every ounce of gelato I might have eaten. I was completely shocked at the service. I took two bites out of the cheesecake and ate half the gelato... Again the waitress went back to speak to the manager and in the end they removed the charge for the cheesecake. The table beside me also ordered cheesecake and they also hated it... Definitely never going back to this place."}
{"text":"Gave this place another shot and was not disappointed. This time around no glass shard was found (thankfully) and the dessert was presented in such a way that you knew they took the time and effort to present it well. 

Service was really great this time. Maybe the couple who runs it? They were really nice and presented us with really cute dessert for a great price. You'd think it was really expensive from how it looks! 

I ordered the maths cheese cake which was delicious! it wasn't too sweet but not too bitter for what matcha is. 

Overall great service. Good dessert. Great price."}
{"text":"The gelato fondue was good but it was pricey ($30). It was enough for 3 people but it could only be split amongst 2 people forcing you to order another item. Also multiple waitresses thought room temperature water was warm water lol, which I guess, could be potential clash of cultures. All in all, good overall experience and great gelato."}
{"text":"When I first entered 0109 Dessert & Chocolate, I was CONVINCED that this would be my new cafe to catch up with friends. It's such a quaint and cute area! 

It all went down from there. We came in a group of 4 and wanted to get the fondue & gelato set ($30) which features a variety of  fruits with chocolate fondue and 12 scoops of gelato. Yes, 12. We thought it was meant to be shared and we were aware of the $2.95 sitting fee but expected the fondue/gelato set to cover it as it was $30 (so $7 per person). BUT THE FONDUE SET ONLY COUNTS AS 2 PEOPLE'S SITTING FEE. What shocked me is when they said that the fondue set is meant to be shared with 4 or 5 people but only counts as 2 people's sitting fee. Uh..what? How does that make sense? 

I questioned them  because wouldn't this discourage people from ordering the fondue set in a group and just get 4 teas (valued at $2.95 each)? Wouldn't they lose money? You know what they said? \"Go ahead and cancel your order then\". Okay fine, you don't want my money? I can take my service elsewhere. 

Of course, we didn't cancel the order (the gelato itself was pretty delicious - the black sesame, passionfruit, coffee and mango were hands down the best.) cause we trekked over to Scarborough and honestly, it was their loss because the 2 extra dishes that we ordered were equally (if not more) terrible. We ordered the matcha green tea creme brulee, which was gritty (they definitely did not strain the custard properly or at all) and had the consistency of a mashed old avocado - not the smooth, delicate creme brulee I was expecting. 

The second dish was Marshmallow Toast - which SHOULD have torched, toasted marshmallows on top of a toast but this was literally 2 pieces of wonder bread (BREAD not toast) with nutella in the centre and barely-toasted marshmallows on top. I could make this better at home.

While the gelato was the winner of the meal, I simply refuse to support this business at all just on the terrible service alone. This place is a money grab and I won't be returning again. ever."}
{"text":"I take back what I said in my previous review. This place is worth more than just one visit. I tried the souffle cheese cake for $7.95 which I really, really liked. I would come back just for this. Its a bit small but the cake was light, fluffy, moist and not overly sweet. It also had a strong cheese flavour which made it taste similar to Uncle Tetsu cake but better in my opinion. Its made fresh so it does take about 15 minutes to prepare. The souffle cheese cake is 5 stars for me.

Also tried the triangle crispy which was basically a sesame brittle served with two scoops of black sesame ice cream and one scoop of chocolate ice cream. The brittle itself had a nice toasted flavour to it. The ice cream was really nice and smooth and went well with the sesame brittle. At $12.95 its a bit pricy but my other half really liked it and she says its a 4 star rating. I would probably rate it a 3 star though....lol 

Service was excellent. I will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"This cafe I would rate 2.5 stars if possible. I was around the area and decided to try this place after reading the reviews. 

My friend and I ordered the plate of macaroons which included a chocolate Eiffel Tower. Everything else on the menu I felt was pretty overpriced. The macaroons were in short, disappointing in comparison to what I've tried. The flavours were bland and nothing what I expected. 

In terms of service, we had to go up to the cashier to pay for our bill since they appeared too busy. I didn't find the service to be very friendly either. I don't think I will be coming back. 

My friend and I were so disappointed, we had to go to Green Grotto afterwards."}
{"text":"The good: probably one of the better dessert places in Markham. I really enjoyed their hot chocolate. Their ice cream was flavourful too! Love the huge selection. They have one of the most variety of dessert I have seen from a dessert place, which is good. They also seem to specialize in making their own in house chocolates.

The bad: price is a tad expensive, but can't complain. Their macarons were ok, not a huge fan.

The ugly: this place can get pretty packed at night so be sure to come early!"}
{"text":"What kind of chocolate place does not have chocolate slush or chocolate smoothie... \"That's like the rules against feminism!!\"

I am not impressed or amused by this."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

I don't come to this plaza much admittedly, however I might have to make a few more visits here cause there are quite a lot of food choices here. There's a bubble tea place, a barbecue buffet place, a noodle place...then after you're done you can come to this dessert place.

One thing came up that made me take away a star. The place is absolutely frigid. I understand it's July and the outside temperature was on the warm side, but did the interior temperature need to be 15 degrees? Cause I was shivering the whole time I was inside.

We were seated immediately and in terms of service it was quite good. Our order was quickly taken, and we ordered the lava cake and the panna cotta. The lava cake we were told would take 15 mins, which we were fine with.

The panna cotta came rather fast, which I liked. It tasted okay, however $5.75 was quite a steep price for such a small cup. It was also rather on the sweet side, so if you don't like it sweet I don't suggest getting it. The lava cake tasted very good! Maybe because I don't know many places that offer lava cake (Aka Teppan is one of them), but it definitely tasted better than Aka.

Compared to dessert places around the area I really did enjoy this place, outside from the frigidness atmosphere. I'm not a huge dessert fan (too much sweets and it adds on to your weight), but for what it's worth this place is worth going."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend to try out the desserts, so we ordered 5 dishes. The interior of the cafe was really nice, it reminded me of those cute hk cafes. The place was roomy and you were able to see the kitchen. Although we were seated beside some girls that needed better mannerism... (Both of them took off their flip flops and were rubbing their feet while eating..gross)! Something to try is the panna cotta which was the best thing we ate. Soufflé was really pain and dry ... So try to stay away from that. While eating our desserts we noticed how thirsty we got so we kept asking for water, which the waitress kept forgetting thus causing us to ask again. She got upset that we kept wanted water and started to avoid our table after awhile. The desserts were mediocre, and for the prices and portion size I'd go to demetres or spin cafe. 5 items costed us almost $50 after tax and tips. Needless to say, the place was great but I won't be coming back for the desserts I ordered. 

Also on a side note; my friend and I ended up getting an allergic reaction/ sugar high after we left. I got a purple lip and my friend got hives all over her face and neck. So warning to people.. Don't eat too much sweets!!! :)

List of items ordered :
Cappuccino Soufflé -very dry and took the longest to come. Very plan tasting .

New York Cheesecake- was pretty good but the portion size is so small for the $6-$8 it costed.

Creme brûlée : decent, but very burnt on the top layer. Wasn't well done, the insides were extremely liquidity 

Panna Cotta- the best thing we tried there! 

Tiramisu: disgusting. Way too watery from the condensation and very bitter. Too much coffee flavour (maybe you'll like it if you enjoy caffeine)"}
{"text":"The place is very cute and awesome for dessert with friends, family or for date night. The service is pretty good as well! The menu offers quite a variety of drinks and desserts ranging from western style to traditional Chinese style and fusions. Teas, lattes and specialty drinks are also available. Definitely on top of my hangout list.

Ordered: 
GREEN TEA: $4loose leaf in a teabag. Nothing special but it wasn't bad. Better then the store bought teabags.

SOUFFLÉ CHEESECAKE: $5-6freshly baked for you. The texture resembles a Japanese cheesecake. Not very sweet so it's good for people who can't handle sweets. The texture is soft and taste is not overpowered by the cheese. I ordered original (other flavours available).

STRAWBERRY CREPE: $6-7the crepe was well done and the amount of fillings were very generous. One of the best crepes I've had to be honest. The balance was just right."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for desserts! It's close in proximity and the staff are always very friendly. One time they messed up my order of soufflé, so it took an extra 10 minutes to make. They apologized and took off 20% from my bill. I recommend the crepes, since they're very tasty and they come in large portions. I usually get crepe with lindt chocolate, bananas, strawberries, and a scoop of chocolate gelato. It's definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"limited selection but it was pretty good place to have a nice sweet night. If I didn't eat dinner that night, I could finish my toast and some of my gf's crepe. Overall, I would come again with my gf, family, and friends."}
{"text":"This place is not just your regular crepe/ waffle dessert place, it is also a chocolate selling store. The atmosphere was great, it has a rustic and warm feeling to it. The waitress was good until the store got busy. The menu had a large range of dessert including your traditional Chinese desserts, macaroons, panna cottas and etc. I would not recommend the fondue because it is not an actual fondue. It was barely warm chocolate for you to dip your food in. Overall, the place was not bad but I would not come back because once is enough for me. Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the gelato's. The taste is nice and bold. Definitely would go back for more."}
{"text":"Nice little dessert place to go to with good atmosphere. The menu has a variety of choices and I was very excited to try the soufflé cheesecake. It was pretty good. 

They bake their molten cakes and soufflés right after you order so I did expect a wait. I would come back again to try the other desserts. The gelato fondue sounds good but definitely going to need 4+ people to share, Overall, experience was good but I do think it was a bit over priced and do not like the \"one item per person\" rule."}
{"text":"Came here last night around 9 PM with a friend and I was surprised to see quite a few people there despite the time. The place was very cozy and it's a nice place to have dessert.

My friend and I ordered a sweet crepe (raspberry jam, whipped cream, and mixed berries) and a tofu cheesecake (with blueberry topping).

Crepe: We loved it. The crepe itself was chewy and the inside was packed with berries! The sweet jam, the tangy berries, and the texture of the crepe... Yum. I would come back just for the crepe.

Tofu Cheesecake: Not as creamy and soft as the one from Jtown. There's this taste of soybean or something which isn't bad, but it was a little unusual. I don't recommend it.

The servers were all very helpful and came by to check up on us once in a while. They weren't intruding with our space and they were friendly.

All in all, 0109 is a dessert place I would come back to for their yummy crepes.

Side note: their lighting isn't very good for photos."}
{"text":"Good desert place to hang out with friends.  Had a wide variety of menu to offer...gelato ice cream, crepes, coffer, and tea. 

They make different chocolates that ate tempting. Most of them are just too cute to eat... maybe next time."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for some late night dessert on a Saturday night. The place was packed and cozy so we had to wait for a table. Once we were seated, we were promptly served tea. It wasn't any ordinary tea, there was some fruity taste to it and it was delicious!
We decided to split a waffle ($11.99). We got strawberry and banana with mango ice cream. The presentation was gorgeous. However, the waffle itself was dry. They needed something like more whipped cream to make the waffle edible after finishing off all the toppings.
I would definitely come back to this restaurant to try some of their other desserts."}
{"text":"Overall satisfied with their service and menu, they have matcha lava cake!!! Multiple selections of hot chocolate sweetness etc. We ordered the 3sweetness level on hot chocolate, was given a heart shaped black&white chocolate on a stick, we melted it for about a minute, the concept was simple but better than just serving a plain cup! I've also ordered their marshmallow toast with condensed milk (I love condensed milk) --- they have choices between Condensed Milk/Nutella/PeanutButter for toasts. It was really good, I've had marshmallow toast at other places before and it's always been too sweet for me, but this one was just right and I'd still have eaten more! Would come back."}
{"text":"Average-decent dessert in the pmall area; however, it is not worth the $. For similar price you can easily get 10 times better and tastier desserts in downtown Toronto or richmond hill. 
They do have a nice variety of chocolate to choose fr, fun, cute, and definitely nice to impress a date.
Their gelato was not good...the texture was very similar to sorbets instead of being the famously known creaminess."}
{"text":"-water was warm tasted funny 
-crepes were small and costed $10 each in the end (strawberry and bananas were extra $3, crepe $5.50) basically a scam and the caramel sauce tasted off 
-weirdly made crepe
-won't go back"}
{"text":"So me and Jubee were craving Demetries however we were very far from one. So we ended up here. We arrived at 12:10am and were reminded 3 TIMES that last call was at 12:30. I felt like telling the servers \"yo relax man\".  We didn't like this at all. 

Anyway the waffle ice cream and strawberries is what we ordered. Very small portion on the ice cream compared to Demetries. If you don't believe me go to Demetries and order the last straw one scoop of their ice cream is more than two scoops at this place. 

Overall nothing special and over priced. Would only come back here as a last resort."}
{"text":"I came here a while ago and thought I'd make a review. This place is a cozy little café that sells variety of different desserts and sweets. During my visit I ordered the Gelato Fondue (29.95). It is made up of 12 different flavours of house made gelato. This is a good way to test out the gelatos. It came with a side of 3 macarons, season fruits, roasted almonds and a bowl of melted chocolate. I only enjoy half of the flavours of the gelatos because I felt like some of the gelatos do not complement well with the chocolate fondue. The creamier ones are better with the fondue whereas the ones that are made without milk are better off alone. The milkless gelatos are really refreshing and I would probably order that one alone next time. The fruits were fresh, but the strawberries were a little sour. As for the macarons, they tasted stable and I did not like the flavours. 

I also ordered a white hot chocolate and a mango sago supreme. The way that they designed the hot chocolate was really unique. They give you a cup of steamed milk and a heart shaped chunk of white chocolate on a stick. You pretty much need to stir the white chocolate into the milk so that it melts into it. 

As for the mango sago supreme, I did not like it. It didn't have a real mango taste to it but rather a store bought mango syrup taste. They added fresh mango to it but ehhhh... not good

Overall, presentation is nice, a little pricey but will probably be coming back since I didn't get to try out the soufflés and cakes."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty good! Highly recommend for besties~ their gelato is homemade
The durian cup is the best in GTA
I love Lindt chocolate and all of their chocolate product is made from Lindt!
The truffle is cute and delish!"}
{"text":"If you want gelato late night uptown then I guess this place is the place to go. I'm kind of over the macaron phase so I don't care too much for those although I have tried them here (they're pretty average). 

I tried this place a few times (had their waffle, crepe, chocolate bowl with green tea mousse, etc.) and never actually thought to give it a review until they pissed me OFFFFFFF last night. This place is the pinnacle of STUPIDITY.

It was my friends birthday and we just finished dinner and had time to kill before the party so we came here for dessert. I told the waitress discreetly twice that it was my friends birthday so PUT A CANDLE ON THE CAKE. I don't know if there was a language barrier or she woke up on the wrong side of the bed because guess what she did!? She brought the candle AND cake AND lighter separately to the table. As this is an Asian place obviously I didn't expect them to put the cake on the house but the LEAST thing u could do is use ur common sense!! After she put all the stuff down, she had the guts to ask for confirmation too: \"you want candle right....?\" Like wtf is wrong with you??? See what I meant by pinnacle of stupidity!? All my friends were nice enough not to care but let me know if I'm overreacting or being dramatic because she completely ruined my friend's surprise!!!! 

Her stupidity is too overwhelming for me. I can't."}
{"text":"We came around 10pm on a Saturday and we waited about 20 mins to get seated. This place is BUSY (it was full even when we left at like 1130pm) but there is no doubting that the food is really high quality! We got the floral waffle, a bunch of scoops of gelato, and the durian supreme which comes with durian gelato. We all really enjoyed our deserts. I really liked the green apple and pistachio gelato. Note that there are more gelato flavours than offered in the book, you just have to look up at the posted board near the front."}
{"text":"My go to place to share a treat and a chat with friends! The lady who works here is super nice and your order comes fairly fast! The selection is amazing and I've never been dissatisfied with anything I've ordered. The chocolate stir sticks are my personal favourite, the lava cake is also my top recommendation! It's never too busy when I've gone and the seating never feels overcrowded so it's a great hangout spot. Not cheap but I think the prices are fair for what you get and the atmosphere of the place!"}
{"text":"I wasn't thinking of getting dessert when I dropped in to check it out but the staff was super friendly and took the time to explain what went into their gelato. 

I gave the Earl Grey Latte gelato a try and it was delicious! Not too sweet and great consistency. Definitely want to go back to try their other desserts. 

The only thing to note is that they were little pricier and charge 25 cents for using a Debit card."}
{"text":"I feel like 0109 doesn't get the acknowledgement they deserve. Starting off I walk in and it's one of the cutest cosiest shops. They always update their menu and is very creative with the desserts they offer. I love their handmade chocolates and the different flavors of gelatos they offer. I'm a killer for gelatos and also really specific with the consistency and by far they nailed it! The servers are very polite, considerate, and patient. Walking in just gives me a feeling of joy and ofcourse the dessert is included in my joy and happiness. Some of the cakes there are half decent, wasn't a huge fan of the tiramisu and creme brûlée. I did really enjoy their Millie crepe cake in the mango flavor. Definitely highly recommended and will come back to try the other desserts on the menu."}
{"text":"Noce ambiance and great for late night cravings.
Had the waffles and soufflé both were outstanding. Will come back."}
{"text":"4 stars for the crepes. Legit amazing. And they don't skimp on the fruit! Just order that and youre good to go. $11 for crepe with fruit, sauce and gelato. BAM. Done."}
{"text":"I was here 2 times and tried both of their flower waffles and it has been an amazing experience. The waffle was made just right with just the right amount of fruits on the side. Sometimes, you go to waffle places and they give you this tiny little scoop of ice cream, but this place doesn't give you ice cream, it gives you a very big spoonful of gelato. Absolutely amazing. They have around 15-20 flavors to try from.

Right now during the winter, their signature is the hot chocolate. Definitely must try this. I've never seen such thing! There's about 6 different sweetness/bitterness levels to try from. I've tried the second last one from being really bitter/dark. They use REAL chocolate to make this drink. A definite must try. It is around $6 per cup. It's worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I was in need of a coffee and because I was in the plaza, decided to stop here for one. As usual, I was tempted by the menu to order more than I need...so I got a dessert in addition to the coffee. It was really awkward dealing with the servers. I was trying to call them over but they weren't coming, so when I went up to the counter to order, they made me sit back down and took my order at the table. Perhaps, do more regular walk-arounds and check on customers? 

Though their strengths certainly do not lay in coffee, they produce a variety of desserts which is what they \"specialize\" in. But then again, if you will charge customers ~$3 for an Americano, perhaps take the time to make a good one!! 

So how is their dessert? Well I had tried their smores/nutella bread. Although it was simply two pieces of bread with nutella and toasted marshmallows on top, it was pretty good...not impressive but good. Its something I could make at home in a few minutes. The hot chocolate was probably the best thing that any of us ordered. It comes served as hot milk with a side of solid chocolate which you stir into the milk. The best way I could describe it is very similar to cocao 70 hot chocolate, just not as thick and expensive. 

Generally speaking, the menu is pretty expensive. For 3 Americanos (they do not serve drip coffee), hot chocolate and a dessert, we spent around $30-$35. The Americanos were disappointing and to be honest the nutella marshmallow thing didn't impress me."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful and relaxing. I've tried the tiramisu and chocolate lava cake. The tiramisu is very good 5/5. The chocolate lava cake is good as well but it does not have enough chocolate inside. It comes with a side of gelato of your choice. I chose the cappuccino flavor and it was delicious. Overall, I will recommend this place and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviews for this one, it is overpriced so minus one star for that. Décor, service, and quality of the food is not bad though, pretty good for something in this area actually. Been here twice and it's usually busy, especially on weekends.This place was a bit loud the times I've been here, but not overly loud that you have to shout over your friend.

Staff was friendly and made sure to refill your tea/water every now and then. There's a section off to the side at the back where you can purchase their chocolates, truffles, and other gifts. Good idea for even more business.

Not a huge fan of their macarons, but their packaging is quite cute; could make for a nice gift. (I think if you order take out for macarons from their menu, it will come with a chocolate Eiffel Tower). 

Their spicy ginger crème brulee has pretty good ginger flavor; the scorched sugar on the top wasn't too burnt or overdone either, which some places tend to do. A weird combo but surprising dish.

The Green tea and special white chocolate cheese cakes were really rich; the portion is good since it's not too big or small. The graham layer on the bottom was a nice consistency: not too moist or dry. It was a bit sweet however so it made the overall dessert a bit too sweet.

Their chocolate banana strawberry crepe was beautifully presented and didn't skimp out on the strawberries or bananas. However, crepes are pretty easy to make at home so don't think I'll be coming back for this one.

You wouldn't really expect this kind of a dessert place to be in this area so this would make a nice visit if you haven't been. Might come here next time for their chocolate bowl which seems like a pretty popular option."}
{"text":"Food is decent but the store policy is a bit inconvenient. Just wanted to grab a quick dessert after a big meal but had to order more then expected. It is mandatory to order one dessert per person. We were so full from dinner and could not order just one thing. Leaving the store not wanting more."}
{"text":"Came into 0109 with a friend for late night desserts and it was okay. 

Food: I ordered one of their specials - matcha red bean lava cake which came with gelato of your choice - and my friend ordered a lindt chocolate crepe with cappucino gelato as well. The desserts were pretty good but wasnt anything spectacular. I do agree that it felt really dry as my friend and I had a few glasses of water to wash it down. They were plated really nicely but for the amount I dont think its worth the price (forgot the price of each item but our total came up to $20). 

Service: The waitresses were very polite and kind when attended to. There werent many on floor so you do have to grab their attention near the back register when you needed something. 

Decor: A dim lighted and spacious cafe. Very artsy looking with lots of hanging frames on the wall. A very relaxed and quiet ambience."}
{"text":"Cute place with lots of yummy desserts! They also have handmade chocolate for sale that's worth giving a try. Price is a bit on the higher end compared to other dessert shops. 

I've had their crepes, fondue and lava cake. All great!"}
{"text":"We came here after dinner and we greatly enjoyed the fondue. There were 4 of us, and we devoured it! The chocolate isn't in one of those containers heating over a small tea light candle, but it didn't matter because by the end of it, the chocolate was still soft and dip-able! The fondue set came with macaroons, at least 9 scoops of ice cream (variety), and fruits. Everything was very fresh and delicious. A few of my friends have already asked where this place is. We would definitely come back to try other desserts!"}
{"text":"We went to this place as recommended by friends. The atmosphere was very welcoming and warm. However, my friends and I were completely and utterly disappointed. The macarons are bought and not made in house. I work in a kitchen and we order the exact same macarons from our supplier. Creme Brulee is not sweet at all. In fact, its very very bland, not even a hint of vanilla. Brulee means burnt. In no way was the sugar caramelized enough to be called a proper brulee. The correct sweetness and bitterness of the caramelized sugar make a perfect creme brulee. The tiramisu was a big letdown. There is too much rum and there is NO MASCARPONE. The only upside was probably the Pocky stick. The crepe was not soft at all and was premade. The molten lava cake was not runny enough. Furthermore, after putting in the order, the tiramisu and creme brulee came out in 3~4 minutes, the crepe in 10 minutes and the molten lava cake in over 24 minutes after the first desserts came out. Portions are small and no real flavours. We are definitely NOT going back."}
{"text":"This place is good, but their polices and service makes no sense. I went with my boyfriend after dinner to grab some decent dessert (second time visiting) but was quite disappointed.

Since we were already quite full from dinner we decided to share a dessert, ordering their 4 scoops of gelato combo ($15.95). As the waitress took our order, she mentioned that they have a policy of ONE menu item PER customer as their minimum charge per person. I was so confused - are they telling me that those 4 giant scoops of gelato was meant for only one person and not to share? To me, the purpose of a minimum charge is to ensure customers are not holding up their table seats without spending money.  I understand if both of us sat down ordering only 1 drink being unfair, but our menu item was $16, not like we are spending $5 for 2 people. We then asked if we could order one macaroon to count and they said one macaroon costs $1.95 which still isn't enough to cover as their minimum charge is $2.95. If you are charging $2.95 as minimum charge, the cheapest thing on your menu should be equivalent to that price. I think this policy was ridiculous. In the end, my boyfriend and I couldn't even finish the 4 scoops of gelato but still purchased a cheesecake take out just to satisfy their 'minimum charge\".

On top of this stupid policy, our waitress was impatient throughout this entire discussion and gave us the impression that they thought we were being super stingy - not to mention her poor English and lack of communication. Even when taking our order of which gelato flavors we wanted to pick, we had to repeat it 3 times. 

Aside from my anger for their service, now to comment on their gelato.
We ordered 4 flavors: Black sesame, green apple, salted caramel, and passion fruit. Of the 4 i liked salted caramel the most. It was the only gelato that actually had the gelato sticky creamy texture (the gelato stretched when you scooped from it). The green apple and passion fruit tasted more like sorbet to me. 

Overall their desserts are pretty decent, but I think this place is overpriced. Poor service really affects my decision of a restaurant, no matter how good your food is, if you have poor service then you have just lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"I've come here so many times before that I was so surprised with my visit this time around. I came on a weekday afternoon by myself to grab a bite before heading off.

I started taking pictures of the menu and then the server asked if she could help me with anything and I said no. I'm just taking pictures of the menu for a review. I continued and then she came again to tell me that pictures aren't allowed and I said again that it's to post onto Yelp for others to see. She went back and returned and said it's not allowed. At this point, I figured it's for price flexibility or they think I'm trying to steal their ideas, whatever the case, I respect their request and stop. A couple minutes later, she returns and asks for my ID. I ask what for, and she said it's to see that I'm REALLY a reviewer. I show her my Yelp profile and she takes a picture of it and returns to her boss. After that happened, I was CHEESED. I've never been so humiliated before. I can't believe they treated me like I was a criminal. I order two items anyway and try not to let it get to me.

1. Portobello Mushroom Crepe ($8.95) - if you like chewy crepes, then you would like this. To me though, it tasted like they undercooked the crepe. There was cheese and mushrooms in it but only near the top instead of throughout. They had sliced some grape tomatoes and celery on the side, but I was so pissed off that I forgot to take a picture. Sorry about that! The crepe came lukewarm, which isn't so bad since you don't want it burning your tongue anyways. There was a very strong pepper smell and taste since they sprinkle some all over it.

2. Matcha Red Bean Lava Cake with Salted Peanut Butter Gelato ($9.95) - the lava wasn't really flowing but I was impressed with the matcha flavour. It was bittersweet like matcha is supposed to be, but the cake itself was pretty dry. The gelato's colour surprised me and I really wanted to like it, but it tasted like salt with a hint of peanut butter. 

FYI - they only accept cash or debit.

Overall, the food and desserts fell short and I was going to try some of the chocolate since they seem to be famous for it, but I was so upset at this point. I also didn't finish my food (which is rare) because I was so disappointed in the way I was treated. To end this experience, after she took a picture of my Yelp profile, she started being REALLY nice. \"Let me fill up your water.\" \"How is everything?\" Ugh. It made me sick. I wonder if it's because they FINALLY believed me when I said I was a reviewer. So if this has happened to you, I just want to give you a shout out that you're not alone and I hope that your experience will be better."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place for dessert. This is a nice quiet place to work or to talk amongst your friends. Our visit was approximately a little bit over an hour because of the wait time for the Matcha Red Bean Lava Cake, but when we first order the server had notified us ahead of time and gave us an option to switch for another dessert. The Flora Waffle was definitely worth its price 14.50, the proportions were big and filling. Although the strawberries were a big sour, it was paired nicely with the gelato."}
{"text":"I love this quaint local business. Definitely a hidden gem in scarborough and you can even see them making the desserts !"}
{"text":"Very dim and romantic place to take a date to however, the desserts are quite a disappointment. 

We ordered this this almond milk dessert and it was pretty bland. It's pretty smooth with a slight hint of almond flavour and that's about it. We also got a slice of cheesecake and that was pretty mediocre. Their gelatos were pretty mediocre too or perhaps, we didn't order the right flavours..? We got the Mixed Berry and Pomegranate. They look very similar and taste very similar as well. The only difference is that the pomegranate one was a bit sour as expected. 

Service was prompt however, dessert was just not there. You're better off with Go For Tea that's right beside it."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times since they have opened. I've tried the waffles, crepes, cheesecake and gelato. The waffle itself isn't the best, but a bit better than your typical waffle - same for the crepe. They give a generous amount of fruits (bananas and strawberries) and the gelato was a pretty decent scoop. I believe a Strawberry & Banana waffles with one scoop of ice cream comes up to $16.63.
Gelato: Chocolate mint - tastes like Lush's mask of magnaminty, not that I have ever tasted the mud mask, but I imagine it would taste like the choco mint. Can someone let me know if they feel that was as well?  Salted Caramel is good, but melted a bit too fast. Chocolate & Hazelnut is by far my favourite, not too sweet and it has this very fine grainy texture - not sure what it is, maybe the hazelnut? but I like it. Green tea was like your normal green tea ice cream. 
*One scoop of gelato on a cone is approx. $6 but they are so generous with the amount. Trust me, one scoop is like your normal 2 huge scoops at everywhere else. 
I would skip on the white chocolate cheesecake - nothing special. 

Overall, 0109 is slightly overpriced, but I do enjoy there waffles and gelato. The atmosphere is calming and never too loud (never been there when it was packed) and it smells nice and chocolatey when you enter.  

*Not sure if this is noted, but you can get take out and they pack everything very well! I do appreciate the effort - got a waffle for take out and I was amazed at how well they packed it. Gelato, fruits and even the whipped cream was in separate containers and given labels.  - gave them an extra star for this."}

0109 Dessert and Chocolate might not be the best dessert cafe in Toronto but if maybe the best you can get in Scarborough!

All those pretty chocolate all made in house. Perfect as gifts to yourself or your friends for all occasion!

The interior is really spacious and homey if you just want to chill out with your friends a little. 

I tried: 

Americano ($2.95) - so so..  cannot really compare to a \"real\" espresso bar

Lava Cake ~ 70% Cocoa ($6.50) - I love dark chocolate and never like my dessert too sweet and this is just perfect!

Sweet Crepe Flavours ($5.50) Home Made Caramel Sauce + Banana/Strawberry ($2) - decent if you love crepes but quite standard

Espresso Milk Chocolate Panna Cotta ($5.75) - meh. Taste like a jello pudding and lack the creamy texture and flavour

Amaretto/Chili Truffles were also pretty good: rich and flavourable!

0109 also offers Chinese dessert which I have yet to try and comment on it.

Pretty promising as a new start up. There are still room for improvement but the owner/chef seems to be passionate and love what they are doing."}
{"text":"24 flavours of Gelato with natural ingredients and flavouring. Have tried birthday cake and green apple both very yummy."}
{"text":"Love this place. 
Let me first off start by saying the food here is AMAZING!!! Hands down the best place for desert. You can tell all the ingredients are fresh!! 

The first time I went here it was Valentine's Day, we had a bit of a wait (as to be expected anywhere on a weekend, let alone Valentine's Day). We got coffee, marshmallow toast and a crepe with gelato. They even sent over a few samples of chocolate (GREAT customer service!!!). 

I also went tonight with my daughter and friend. My friend kept going on about how nice it was inside and how good everything was. The server always checked on us to make sure we had water and that everything was okay. On our way out after we paid our bill and said thank you, the owner came over and gave my daughter an extra treat for the way home. 
Will be back for sure !! 
Great time every time we go! Outstanding customer service ! I wish every company was like this !"}
{"text":"Time for an update.  I tried their cheesecake and crepe this time.  Both were excellent.  There was some skills in making these, as food was good yet with a small twist.  The cheesecake was not like the English style.  It was lighter and softer in texture, yet it tasted cheesy and creamy.  The crepe looked like any other crepe.  Once we sunk our teeth into it, there was a slight chewiness and bounce there.  It was slight, and it might not be everyone's cup of tea, yet we liked it.  There were many fruit bits, so it was sweet naturally.

0109 has proven itself as not just another dessert place that pops up due to trend."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They make all their deserts on their own and the owners are very friendly. Its great for dessert and they have free wifi"}
{"text":"The store is actually hard to see, just because the name seems weird. At first, I was like, what's 0109, then I saw chocolate and desserts. I knew I had to try it. When you first step in, it has the feel of a coffee house cafe. Then, there's a display of chocolates. The staff there were really nice and it's a really cozy place. Really nice to catch up with friends. 

My friend and I shared most of the desserts, that way we could order more. 
First off, the molten lava cake. AMAZING! I think it was made with dark chocolate, but it wasn't sweet at all. Not as rich and sweet as other ones I've tried before. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who goes there. It's made fresh and served nice and hot. Great for a cold day!

We also tried the serradura (I think that's what it's called). It was a strange dessert. It was weird. It was hard at the top because it was frozen, but then it goes to be very smooth at the bottom. It's a strange kind of dessert, but I enjoyed it. Would enjoy it more in the summer though on a hot day, rather than on a day where it's pouring snow out.

I got a cappuccino. I sat there for  a long time to finish it. Reminded me of the big cups you have downtown. Now I don't have to go all the way downtown to get a coffee with art on it. hehehe.

We also tried the dark chocolate cup with yogurt mousse. I personally enjoyed it. It was very different. The dark chocolate cup wasn't much, but the yogurt mousse was good. It had yogurt taste, but mousse feel, and the dried fruit (cranberries and mangoes) made it much more unique. 

Overall, I'm definitely going back. I've got to try the whole menu. Next up will be the crepes and creme brulee. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more. I really did! This place reminded me of cute dessert cafes in Korea, but from my first visit, I wasn't very impressed with the food. I had been excited to try their molten lava cake after reading all the rave reviews. 3 of us at the table ordered it, and all 3 of us agreed that it was too rich! I really love a good, rich molten lava cake, but this was chocolate overboard. I also didn't like how there wasn't an option to substitute the default vanilla/chocolate gelato to other, more enticing options (waitress told us we'd have to pay the full price for the substitute fancy gelato, rather than just the price difference) Honestly, I was barely able to finish half of my lava cake. My friend tried the green tea creme brûlée, but this was also quite disappointing! The top exterior was barely brûlée.

Despite these disappointments, I'd still like to come back again and try their crepe and gelato. Hopefully my next experience will be better, because I'd love to have a good dessert place in my neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I fail to see how this place will ever disappoint me. Came around to try their gelato menu after dining at Magic Noodle and was wowed at the number of flavours. Though I was tempted to try the matcha gelato, I only had enough stomach for the black sesame. One scoop was more than enough, they're generous with their scoops which is nice considering places I've been to give you less than ideal.

The black sesame taste was very rich, not too creamy. It wasn't as thick as I'd like it to be so a point off there (also because I'm very biased towards Kingyo's black sesame gelato). Service was friendly and smiling as always.

I'll definitely be back to try the other flavours soon!"}
{"text":"If you love durian, you must must must visit 0901 Dessert & Chocolate.  There is a choice of durian cheese cake and durian supreme that you can choose from.  If you are curious about durian, go for the cheese cake as the scent and durian taste aren't over powering.  But if you are a seasoned durian lover like me, you will be delighted by the true durian taste found in the durian supreme dessert.  Seriously to die for!!!!  
If you are not into durian, that's  ok too because there are tons of other desserts to choose from, so don't worry; stay happy lol.
The associates working there are eager to help you out.  Just don't take their pictures as they are camera shy.
The restaurant itself is very pretty and artistic.  Lots of pictures lined the walls, and lovely packaged chocolates are found on the shelves.  Overall, the experience is very pleasing indeed!!!"}
{"text":"Like @Allison Y's rating I would give it a 3.5.  My reasons are a bit different though.  I came here for the a savory crepe and dessert as my last hurrah before I go on a diet hiatus for a few months.

First off was their crepe, I tried a bite of my wife's Mushroom and Swiss and had my own which was Smoke Salmon *flavored* cream cheese with egg mixture.  One thing I have to say was the choices in the restaurant were lacking in *meat*, but they were definitely not lacking in *flavor*.   The taste was quite good considering the limited ingredients they had used.  The crepe they had was not visibly thick from afar, but it is thicker than normal so it adds to the filling, but not by much.

Depending on my mood and stomach capacity at the moment this can either be good or bad, today was good because I had breakfast already so I wasn't feeling hungry after eating it.

However, I was curious about their gelatos and wanted to see if we can get it with any of their \"pretty\" styles.  Unfortunately, the ones in the pretty styles are limited to the gelatos flavors they had chosen so I couldn't get the pistachio, cappuccino or hazelnut gelatos.  Instead I opted for the gelatos on their own in the waffle cones and waffle cone bowl dipped in nuts and chocolate.  

The waffle cone itself was pretty good to the level of Menchies, and the nuts and chocolate on the bowl were better than that of Menchies.   They have a lack of proper utensils to eat the waffle bowl though; the small spool didn't provide enough cutting power I had to request a knife to get through it.

It was too bad the gelatos themselves were \"subpar\" I would say I get the same quality and satisfaction to the one I get at Tutti Fruity (the small grocery at Toronto General Hospital).  So I still need to drive to Main Street Markham to go to Love Gelato in order to get my proper gelato fix.  I was thinking of it too but the gelatos we had were too sweet for comfort that if I had a proper gelato fix I would likely gag and feel uncomfortable the rest of the day.

In the end my last hurrah felt like it ended with a whimper.  Oh well the diet does not last that long, it only feels like forever."}
{"text":"Rating is actually 3.5 stars, rounded up.

Came here with a friend on a Sunday evening, it was quiet for a weekend. Ordered their all-in-one hot chocolate, Nutella marshmallow toast and their cappuccino cheesecake souffle.

I was a big fan of the hot chocolate, though for 5$ I expected a bit more. First, you choose your flavour (ranges between dark chocolate to white chocolate with milk choco in-between!) They come out with steamed milk and a heart-shaped chocolate on a stick. From there, you can stir in as much (or little) of it in as you like!

The Nutella marshmallow toast was a great hit. Reasonably priced at around 5$. There was a good ratio of toast:Nutella:marshmallow. Will definitely order this again!

I am a huge cheesecake lover. This is my first time trying a souffle-type cake. What a disappointment! I did not enjoy this at all. The cappuccino flavour was really off-putting. I wish I had ordered the original instead, but I went with the server's suggestion on which was tastier.

All in all, my experience was OK. The chocolates placed around the store were nice to look at. 

Bonus: free wifi and clean washrooms."}
{"text":"Good service, good attitude, but the servant doesn't understand English very well so I usually use Chinese to talk with them. Overall, the taste of the dessert is pretty good, but some of them are too sweet."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a must try. There are a lot of different desserts to taste! If you love rose tea, I would definitely recommend it here. 

The service is a little bit inattentive but once you have their attention they will most certainly help."}
