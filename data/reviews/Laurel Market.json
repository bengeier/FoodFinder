{"text":"Lots of very interesting sandwich and wrap options. Probably the most interesting and unique sandwiches and wraps ive ever had in one place to be honest. Definitely take time to read the menu. I have never even thought of a lot of the toppings they chose to put on their sandwiches. And they are all good. I've tried most"}
{"text":"This is a neat little deli and convenience store, and not like the typical convenience stores that are paired with gas stations.  They have a great sandwich selection, with vegetarian options, an interesting bottled drink selection, and you can buy wine here.    The bruschetta sandwich tastes good, but is a complete mess to eat.  Also, they serve breakfast sandwiches.  Haven't tried them yet, but plan to!  It's really small and a bit cramped, but definitely worth a stop in.  From the outside, it looks a tad shady to me, but fear not.  Good sammies await!"}
{"text":"Huge, delicious sandwiches.  Take out only and I would recommend calling in your order because the wait for your sandwich can be 10-20 minutes.  A must try!"}
{"text":"This place rules.  It's like Cheers in there: full of regulars and everyone knows your name.  Great pre-made items,  sandwiches to order, good coffee in lots of flavors. Will is reliably behind the counter weekday mornings... he's the nicest guy you could meet.  I order sourdough grilled cheese with mozzarella, tomato,  and bacon.  Soooooo good! Thick cut bacon,  juicy fresh mozzarella, awesome bread! And call ahead is welcome, so it's ready when you walk in."}
{"text":"This place is my must visit place whenever I'm in town. Great fresh made sandwiches and coffee! I especially like the turkey sandwich with avocado, walnuts and apricot spread on wheat bread. Yum!"}
{"text":"Laurel Market has been a staple in my world since i moved to the Elizabeth neighborhood. Some mornings I will walk my dog down to get my coffee from their caffeine buffet (always French Vanilla with a biscotti on the side). Their breakfast wraps are my favorite in town and easy on the wallet. I keep it simple with the bacon, egg, and cheese in a spinach wrap.   They also have an excellent wine and beer selection for fancy drinkers. And the staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and sides. A good solution for a quick pick up, you wont be dissappointed. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 is the store as a whole and the prices, although understandable being a small shop."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best sandwiches in town! I'd also like to point out that Laurel Market is not in Elizabeth like Yelp is saying, nor is it in Myers Park. It's technically in Eastover."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this store. the main reason is the hygiene concerns. I don't know why many people like it."}
{"text":"This the coolest, teeny-tiny local deli. It's been around for years. Very fresh sandwiches on local bread - lots of vegetarian options. The staff could not be nicer. We just moved into the neighborhood and plan to frequent it a lot.  Note, they have odd hours."}
{"text":"Went to the laurel market for the first time last week and it was one of the best sandwiches I've had in charlotte. I got a turkey, goat cheese, avocado, currants,  and apricot spread wrap and loved it. They also have a huge selection of drinks and snacks.  The setup is very cozy and feels like a mom & pop type of market.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great place for a fresh deli sandwich or to pick up some wine. The lunch deli is open till 3 so it's best to get your orders in early if you eat a late lunch. I also love it for the pre-made foods when I'm in a pinch. Cute little store with \"know-you-by-name\" staff\". I like to grab provisions here for picnics in the park, too."}
{"text":"The best sandwich I've ever had! Read about Laurel Market in Charlotte Agenda, so glad I went. The look of the market may put you off, but once you have a bite of one of their sandwiches you'll love it!   #3 without the meatloaf but with cucumbers on sourdough- to die for! The ingredients are fresh and delicious, and the sandwich is stuffed with fillings. So good! Must visit in Charlotte! So impressed!"}
{"text":"The website needs work, I just can't seem to find the menu. They need a big button that says MENU that links to a PDF of a menu.  Regardless, this is the best sandwich spot in Charlotte. Tons of good bread options, fresh ingredients. The tortas are delicious too."}
{"text":"You definitely have to be looking for Laurel Market to find it; it's just off of providence road and looks like your average beer/wine convenience store. Delicious breakfast sandwiches and a great place for lunch. They have many options as far as breads, cheeses, toppings, etc and the prices are very reasonable, $3.50 for a huge breakfast sandwiches. I also like their brand of chips they carry, I can't think of the brand but they have a large variety of unique flavors. And if it's more convenient you can call your order in ahead of time and it will be ready when you get there."}
{"text":"Likes: Don't be fooled by the unassuming storefront! This is a great neighborhood deli and market. The sandwiches are delicious! Great beer and wine selection and speciality foods. Great gourmet coffee selection hot and ready for self serve.  Gripes: Deli hours are not as posted online and the website needs some work. For example, you can order online but apparently not on Sundays - which you learn just from it not working on Sundays but this is not posted anywhere online."}
{"text":"It's true, I live right around the corner and have only been to Laurel Market once.  THAT SAID, I got a truly delicious breakfast burrito there once, on my way out to Charlotte Douglas Int'l for an early morning flight, and one of these days I'm going to need to go back and order something yummy and equally delicious.  Their selection of veggies sandwiches is great.  One star off for how long it took them to make my bk burrito (like, 10 minutes, and I was an impatient little jerk in a hurry), but I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Best deli in Charlotte with amazing coffee selection! Seriously best coffee bar ever. I mix and match. I will do half french roast for depth with a splash of butterscotch blend or some other combo. They also have pumpkin roast coffee and more than one decaf selection. Tarragon chicken salad is not mayo heavy at all with grapes and a few pecans. So big I split with a friend and we get it on a great fresh whole wheat. Also they carry Zapps New Orleans potato chips, win! Also try their BLTA: bacon lettuce tomato and avocado. So good."}
{"text":"I like options. I have CM, Adam's, and Laurel Market close to my house. A big fan of CM and Adams, and decided to try Laurel Market to see if it could fit in the rotation.  There were issues with my experience; sandwiches were good, but that said - for the rotation order LM falls to 3rd behind Adam's and CM."}
{"text":"There's a reason people say this is the place to go for sandwiches. My boyfriend and I have never had a disappointing meal here, and we always find a yummy treat to pick up on the way out, like freshly made Rice Krispie treats or strawberry cake. Also a good selection of coffee and breakfast sandwiches, and they're open until 11. A Charlotte must."}
{"text":"Not sure why it took me so long to check this place out. The sandwich is what this place does. They've got a team of ladies behind the counter making some delicious looking food and building some ridiculous mountain of bacon. Not sure what for yet but I intend to find out. I got the meatloaf sandwich. It was under $7, bigger than most restaurant burgers and very tasty.  I'll be back. Keep in mind this spot is small and has no seating. You gotta get your coffee sandwich and eat somewhere else. I have no problem with that."}
{"text":"Just tried Laurel Market today for the first time, thanks to my fellow Yelpers :) I've driven by a bunch of times, but like others mentioned, it doesn't look like much from the outside.  I had the Athena wrap. YUM! It was fresh and I loved the dressing on it. I could taste the hummus in every bite...mmm, can't wait to go back soon.  If you haven't, definitely give Laurel Market a try!"}
{"text":"I'll preface by saying this place is a little ghetto and there is not really any seating options.  However, the sandwich selection is great.  Tons of vegetarian options and some other good combinations.  The bread comes from some organic or natural bakery that I can't remember the name of but we had seen at the farmer's market earlier that day.  They also have a bunch of drink and beer options if you are stopping by on the way somewhere.  I'd pick over subway any day!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place to pick up lunch. Good sandwiches and other stuff that you can easily take to go. Quick and good prices. Awesome spot!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Charlotte. They get all their bread fresh every day from Nova's bakery. All of their ingredients are fresh and prepared daily. I usually go with the Mercado on Foccacia bread... the breakfast torta and mercado are also excellent. The online ordering feature is also really nice, you don't even have to log in... just order a sandwich and leave your name and number. They usually have it ready in 20 mins."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the hidden gems in the Charlotte area. Laurel Market is located in a little strip plaza and at first glance looks like a typical convenience store. However this place cranks out some of the BEST breakfast and lunch sandwiches I've ever had and at a dirt cheap price! My personal favorite is the Americano which is fresh cracked eggs bacon sausage and American cheese on your choice of bread - and there are tons of bread choices. From artisanal breads to croissants or bagels, you name it they've got it. I personally get mine on the Bolillo bread. These sandwiches are no small serving and for $5 well worth it. They also serve like 35 different flavors of coffee. Highly recommend you check this place out if in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Best coffee in town! Seriously! Great food too, especially breakfast. Nice little corner market, typically pretty busy, lots of wine, beer, and snacks."}
{"text":"Love it! I've been here numerous times for fresh-made sandwiches and sides.  Everything is fresh. It's a little pricey for a deli, but the sandwiches are so big I can order just a half sandwich. Love to give this place business instead of a chain. In cooler weather, their soups are usually very good."}
{"text":"LM is a 10/10. This is THE BEST deli spot in all of Charlotte. I would eat breakfast and/or lunch here everyday if I could. I have tried several different sandwiches and usually end up customizing them. Even when the deli closes (around 3-3:30 I think?) they have premade sandwiches, snacks, drinks and such available. Very impressive wine selection as well! Stop reading this and go there right now.    Note that It is really small and you will need to get it to-go as there is no seating except for a bench or two outside."}
{"text":"Love the selection of sandwiches they offer at Laurel Market! I'm cutting down on my meat intake and it's a nice to see place that offers not one or two menu items that are veggie but more like over 15 different items--woo hoo. My only gripe is they close the deli a bit early and how I crave Chik Fil A every Sunday, I want Laurel Market around 6 or 7P knowing the deli closes at 3P. A bit pricier sandwiches but I'd rather see my money go towards a locally owned business than some chain place."}
{"text":"Am I comparing this to other deli's in Charlotte, or to similar places in other cities?? Other cities. StL specifically. Le Grands and Macklinds have a notch on LM.  My visits to Laurel always result in good sandwiches and great service. I like the LuLu wrap quite a lot. Order from the deli counter or the cashier if it's busy. I'd love a spot to sit down and eat my sandwich, you'll probably have to take it to go!"}
{"text":"So, I was actually trying to drive to Panera (yeah I know, boo for chains, but whatever sometimes you just want to know what to expect) and I frantically made my left off of Providence a little too quickly and ended up in the Starbucks parking lot.  I don't know what it is about businesses here but they sure don't like sharing parking.  I couldn't even walk over to Panera, there were hedges everywhere. So I gave up and wandered around the area that was accessible by my parking lot and found this little convenience store plus sandwich shop.  I saw some folks eating on the tables outside of the place and that clued me in to the sandwich aspect of this market. Well I went up to the sandwich counter and was kind of ignored by the two employees for a minute... granted they were both working on sandwiches but you know, you expect eye contact or something.  Then one of them asks, \"did you order?\" I'm like... \"no\".  Who would I have ordered from? At this point they would've had to have had pretty darn good sandwiches to put me back in a good mood and luckily they did.  I ordered a juiced up BLT with avocado and other deliciousness on it and it was very tasty and fresh.  It was made pretty quickly too, I guess there ain't a lunch rush on Saturdays.  So two stars for kind of lousy customer service, four stars for a very yummy sandwich."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich is the Laurel Market with goat cheese, eggs, bacon and your choice of homemade bread from Nova. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and coffee selection. I would highly recommend it to anything looking for a good, quick place to eat"}
{"text":"Never Had a Bad Sandwich here and I think they have the best tuna salad sandwich I have ever had. Friendly and pretty fast also a very interesting little store. A bunch of items you don't see anywhere else."}
{"text":"A great little shop for a quick snack and some booze.  Its been forever since I've eaten the food hear though, so don't quote me on that.  My more recent experiences have all been beer or wine related.  Oh yeah, Roberto is quite a friendly guy!"}
{"text":"Hi. I just moved from the Washington, D.C. area and was looking for am amazing deli or place to get a great sandwich. Laurel Market is the place! The ingredients are amazing and the selection of cookies, cakes and brownies are divine. From sandwiches and homemade salads, the place is really spot on and a local treasure.  My one complaint, and I was going to take away a star, is that the hours on Yelp show Saturday from 6:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. I arrived at 3:45 p.m. on a Saturday and the place was closing for the day. They probably had another $200 in potential business waiting for food service but the deli counter made it loud and clear they were closed. The only food available was pre-made/pre-packaged. The deli closes at 2:00 on Saturday and Sunday. This should be reflected on Yelp. Not their fault for this incorrect posting.  Just ordered Brunswick Stew and a Garden Tuna Wrap for delivery through Door Dash. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"The Laurel Market is another quaint Charlotte institution that is full of character (and sometimes characters!).  I like the wine section and can always find something new to try."}
{"text":"Laurel Market is a great place for sandwiches, it's located in a convenient store behind the Starbucks, beside the Manor Theatre on Providence.  There's no place to eat your sandwich, there are a couple of benches and a few chairs out front, so you are lucky to grab one.  My favorite is when you get lettuce on a sandwich they put two different ones, so it really gives it a nice texture and they aren't stingy with toppings, everything is equal amounts.  The store itself is great too, nice beer and wine selection, not huge, but decent brands. Plenty of chips, cakes and candies!!!  My favorite sandwich is the chicken torta, french bread, chicken, lettuce, tom, onion, black bean spread and extra jalapenos!  Yes, please!!  And I also love their bologna sandwich, it's sliced thin with mayo, lettuce and tomato.  I can't believe I order a bologna sandwich, but I have many times!!  Coffee and sweet tea too!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem. Always a line for their sandwiches and it's so worth the wait. Everything is made fresh to order.  Breakfast sandwiches are cheap and outstanding. Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Deliciously fresh combinations for breakfast and lunch. The breakfast Torta and Mercado are some of my favorites. A numerous amount of healthy alternatives and snacks to choose from as well! Fresh coffee and pastries!! My fave breakfast spot when I get off work! Can never go wrong with Laurel Market. And local neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem right next to Starbucks on Providence Rd.  One of the best places to grab a sandwich made to order.   Their breakfast torta is the bomb (tip:  add either tomato or avocado as a neat alternative).  Take out only.  Credit cards accepted.   Parking limited.   I would have given 5 stars but I don't all the flavored coffees.  If they put in a 1st rate expresso machine and got serious about coffee--ouch!"}
{"text":"So I happened upon this place after I was searching for a new place to get a breakfast sandwich here on Yelp. I live in Dilworth, so it isn't too far. They had a great variety of breakfast and regular sandwiches and also many flavors of coffee, which I love. I got the Americano breakfast sandwich, which is huge, and a large cinnamon hazelnut coffee. Both were delicious. It was a little more than I would usually pay, but considering the large size, well worth it.  The only thing that I didn't like was the lack of seating with tables. I had planned to eat there and then run other errands, but all they have are benches outside, with nowhere to set my coffee and sandwich. If they could add some tables, it would be great. I do plan to come back and try some of their regular sandwiches in the future as well."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Laurel Market for years and I adore their sandwiches! I frequently get the Healthy Americano on a spinach wrap for a weekend late breakfast.  My sweetheart loves the Smoked Turkey with apricot spread, currants, walnuts, lettuce and tomato, which he describes as one of the best sandwiches he has ever had.  There is frequently a line but it is worth the wait and the staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place and I might come to like it if the breakfast is any good. I went with my girlfriend for a late breakfast once but ended up going to Einstein's Bagels next door since they had stopped serving breakfast.  We tried again weeks later for lunch but were not impressed. What we ordered wasn't bad, just completely forgettable and overpriced for what we got. We each got a sandwich I could've easily made at home for a fraction of the price and a can of soda. For this I ended up parting with over $20. Bear in mind that these weren't even particularly big sandwiches and my girlfriend's wrap was completely vegetarian (and missing the hummus it was supposed to have in it). So I have no idea how $20 is justified. On top of all that, the service was slow even though we were the only customers in there.  I'll give Laurel Market another try at breakfast but if it's not a considerably better experience than last time I'll just stick with Einstein's or Common Market when the morning finds me in South End."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic neighborhood market. They have a little bit of everything. The most outstanding feature at Laurel Market are the five maybe six friendly ladies that work the made to order deli.  This deli serves breakfast and lunch. Their food is fabulous and consistently served with a smile. They have a wide array of deli meats home made deli salads like chicken, tuna and egg. They also have a variety of fresh made breads for sandwiches. The portions are generous!  You can't go wrong here. Be aware this is a take out establishment. There are some benches outside if you are lucky to find a seat in this popular establishment."}
{"text":"Friendly fast service - got the Americano on white bread grilled as per the suggestion of one of my gfs. She was right, her husband said add mayo and sriachia, he was even righter (yall are following) - coffee selection was legit, all the flavors, I'll post a pic - def looking forward to trying more of their sandwiches and being a real fat girl on a cheat day and eating all that carrot cake in the front case  check it out! Such an awesome hole in the wall!"}
{"text":"I love the Laurel Market- this is definately the place to go if your idea of a sandwich consists of more than what they have to offer at subway.  This is a great place to go for lunch or to grab a dinner to go.  When the kitchen (deli) is open, they have a huge variety of at least 30 different hot and cold sandwiches with fresh and gourmet ingredients (lots of avocado, brie, hummus,etc.).  They offer side items like pasta and potato salad, chips, or fresh fruit salad.  The desserts (my favorite is the chocolate and cherry black forrest cake) are huge and to die for.  If you go after 5 than you can choose from the boxed sandwiches and salads to take home.  They also sell a decent variety of wine and beer.  There is also a location at 1515 South Blvd in the Dilworth/ South End neighborhood."}
{"text":"Good healthy and fresh sandwiches. The place is not cheap for a sandwich but be sure of what you want but the food is good."}
{"text":"Love love love their sandwiches. They're quick and convenient, and they offer many vegetarian friendly options. The only bad thing is that it can be difficult to choose which sandwich to go with. I haven't tried the breakfast sandwiches yet but hope to do so soon. Note that there are no tables. This is a place to grab a quick meal, snack or drink to go."}
{"text":"Laurel Market is great for takeout sandwiches. It's one of those places I wish was really close to work or home. You could eat from there almost every day & be happy."}
{"text":"Sadly, I had no idea this scrumptious deli was here!  From the outside, it really isn't all that appealing.  Passing by, nothing would make me take a second glance (perhaps why I didn't realize it was here).  However, I was across the street getting my hair done and a bunch of hair stylists recommended their food.  I headed over there around 3:00 PM and I was so disappointed that the deli counter was closed.  They were no longer making made to order sandwiches but they did have a few in the cooler.  I got a turkey wrap with feta cheese, lettuce and tomato.  It came with the most amazing dressing (kinda like a tangy balsamic).  I also got a side pasta salad which also had a Greek theme (feta, onions, olives) and it was delicious.    I will definitely be back here for lunch.  I took away one star because they close the deli counter so early and it is quite small on the inside with no curb appeal.  Get there early and you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"This neighborhood market has been around for a long time.  Their deli never disappoints.  Great breakfast and lunch options.  Plus a typical convenient store with a big wine section."}
{"text":"Our new neighborhood spot. I quick ten minute walk or five minute bike ride from where my fiancee and I recently moved (and when I say recently, I mean June). We formerly lived over in the Wesley Heights area and loved Rhino Market (still do), so when we swung through Laurel Market, it was like being back at home. I would say a smaller variety of food options than Rhino, but larger selection of sandwiches if that makes sense. Also the coffee selection is \"on fleek\" as the kids say. I'd guesstimate that they usually have around 8-10 canisters of different options, local and not, available. Plenty of pre-made sandwiches, pasta salads, desserts, and other grab-n-go items if you're in a hurry.  I've had the Mercado sandwich for breakfast and lunch, and would have it for dinner. Also great selection of beer, wine, and some provisions. Only issues I have is the lack of tables/seating. Some benches outside, but nowhere to really sit and relax without having your drink on the ground and food in your lap."}
{"text":"Breakfast torta is the bomb! It's a great tradition to pick one up before a panthers game. Love the small, quaint deli feel. Authentic to the area and name!"}
{"text":"This cute little convenience store/deli is a great place to grab a sandwich or six-pack when you're on the run. Unfortunately, the deli counter isn't always open and the pre-made sandwiches aren't quite as good as the fresh ones. I recommend the turkey, tuna salad or chicken salad sandwiches."}
{"text":"Laurel is great and the staff are friendly, however I find it sometimes difficult to verify my order with some of them because of the language barrier. Most speak and understand English perfectly well, but some will listen to my order, nod their head and turn away to prepare it and more often I end up with something missing or extra that I didn't ask for. It would be nice to see them prepare it or to have it verified back to me before they run off and make my sandwich. However I will always come back because the breads are delicious, the prices are great, and it is a hole in the wall secret you'll only know about by its faithful patrons. Do give it try, but make sure you are clear with what you want!"}
{"text":"After multiple issues with the online ordering and timing, this error seems to have been fixed and haven't had any issues. I am thrilled because this place does have some of the best sandwiches in town."}
{"text":"Best breakfast sandwich in all of Charlotte! I highly recommend the Breakfast \"torta\".  It's egg, havarti cheese, chorizo, and cilantro on a toasted ciabatta.  I also love the selection of healthy drinks and snacks they have as well as wines."}
{"text":"The Laurel Market rocks!  Lunch today was the Lulu, a hummus tabouleh, nice simple, fresh and delicious.  Breakfast is well worth checking out. Peace-aNDy Cauble"}
{"text":"Yelp asked me what keeps making me coming back here? I'm going to tell you, it's their sandwiches. Their breakfast sandwiches are some of the best in Charlotte... the ladies behind the counter know how to create a piece of heaven between two slices of bread.   My all-time favorite is their Americano: bacon, sausage, egg and cheese. It's certainly a nice sized sandwich and super satisfying.   They have plenty of good stuff in there (beer/wine/everything else), I just always go for the sandwiches..."}
{"text":"#5 no goat cheese on white bread!!! Yes please!  it's just fresh veggies and it is so good!  And their orzo salad is delicious. They don't always have it but when they do Im sure to grab one. They have awesome sweet potatoe chips and they carry \"krackle\" candy bars. If you've never had one, you are really missing out. You need to grab one. They are delicious. They are in a red wrapper   Laurel market makes great sandwiches, breakfast and lunch. (They stop making them at 3)  they have lots of drinks chips and candy to choose from, They also have pre-made items or a menu to choose from that they'll make fresh. There is always a line so if you are in a hurry be sure to call in. However, there can often be a language barrier.... They struggle understanding sometimes and often mess up your order.   Susan the manager is super nice and this place has a lot to offer. It's basically a local gourmet convenient store that makes really great fresh sandwiches and is Open til 10pm. (Don't forget you can't get a custom order after 3, that part closes down)  Oh and There's really no seating unless you want to pop on a bench outside. So plan on take out only.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Laurel Market never fails!!   I always get the #8, BLT with avocado.  Heaven!   I always go thinking I will branch out but it gets me every time!"}
{"text":"It's a great little place by Starbucks. They make the best sandwiches. I think they stop making them early around 2."}
{"text":"If you're a first timer like we were, learn from our mistake and don't go during the post-church rush.  There's no discernible line for ordering or paying. It's kind of a free-for-all. The ladies behind the counter take orders, answer the phones, make sandwiches, and call out when your creations are ready.   Along the walls are displays with chips and snacks, and beverage coolers. Cases along the sandwich assembly line feature premium meats, cheeses, and refrigerated prepared goods. There's no good place to wait. You're going to be in someone's way no matter where you stand.   Once you've collected everything you'd like, March your way over to the cashier, where again, there's no good place to form a line.   It's take-out only, unless you're cool with parking yourself on one of the benches out front.   I will say, the selection is hefty and the sandwiches are quite good. They have gluten free bread for sandwiches and there doesn't seem to be an upcharge for it. But learn from our experience and call in your order or be doomed to endure a thousand \"excuse mes.\"  Bottom line, this is a Common Market without the personality."}
{"text":"YEAH for breakfast sandwiches!  I love finding the time to sneak over there before work and grab a delicious breakfast sandwich.  They are fresh and made with tender, love and care.  I don't frequent the Laurel Market as much as my Mom does who goes to fill up her coffee 3-4 time a day but regardless, these women are hooked!  Friendly and hard working staff.  Great beer and wine selection.  Perfect neighborhood hang-out."}
{"text":"A friend of mine lives near here and recommended it for a quick and easy lunch. I ordered the CAST(Cheddar Apple Smoked Turkey), which was very good! I got it on focaccia, but next time I would probably choose wheat to compliment the sweetness of the apple. The sandwich was HUGE and lasted me for 2 lunches. It was a great deal!  Prices were very reasonable and they had a huge variety of options. Even a vegetarian had a plethora of options, which is rare for a sandwich-centered place. I love that everything is made to order. It's super convenient for to-go food, but maybe not so much for spending time there. There wasn't much in the way of seating."}
{"text":"I just ordered the Yard Art sandwich on baguette and added olive oil and vinegar, pepper and oregano.   One of the most delicious sandwiches ever!!  Laurel Market is great - I love the vegetarian wraps and sandwiches - I usually customize something... exchange cheese types or such.   If half sandwiches are still available for half the price, that's often plenty.  Good wine selection too but I wish more current info was available on various bottles- descriptions, awards etc. The notes are sometimes dated and don't match bottles.  Laurel could sell more wine, open more locations, open patios and do so much more. But maybe that's the beauty of this neighborhood spot. Housed in a former 7-11, Laurel is independent, unique and overall, The Real Deal.  Let's keep it our little secret."}
{"text":"I walked in here today while running errands on South. It's such a cute little store--I had to. Seriously, it's cute: a tiny little shop standing alone amidst strip malls and off the highway. It's like out of a movie in a weird way.   It's pretty nondescript otherwise: just your normal, run of the mill convenience store. Decent drink selection and lots of beer, which is nice. Some decent deli stuff, too, including fresh sandwiches.   Also, it's much cheaper than a similar shop at like Circle K, so be sure to check it out."}
{"text":"Yummy! Laurel market definitely hit ms the spot when you are in the mood for a delicious deli sandwich. I also love the different variety of sandwiches they have and different types.   I'm all about chicken salad and they had regular, curry, and tarragon (so good)! I've had the curry before too and that was surprisingly really good. They have the typical deli sandwiches as well turkey, ham, cheeses etc. which also looked really great. Next time I go I definitely want to try one of their specialties they have listed on the boards up front.   My boyfriend got a bacon, egg, and cheese. The breakfast menu was quite elaborate as well! We're from NY and have had some trouble finding a good BEC. Laurel market definitely compares and will probably be our go to from now on!   Slob wth sandwiches, the deli also offers a ton of other great typical deli items. They have everything from salads to chips to drinks to wine to beer to pretty much anything to accompany your meal. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nice corner market with a very friendly staff and their breakfast sandwiches are amazing"}
{"text":"LOVE everything about this place - the employees, the sandwiches, the tid bit selection, the snacks and drinks! What I don't love is their use of styrofoam coffee cups. They are busy enough to spend a bit more on greener cups. C'mon guys invest into your community and environment."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Please don't change a thing. These people are the real deal. Amazing customer service, fresh ingredients, tons of sandwich varieties. There is nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"Yummy chicken salad in a wrap!  And Tab!  They have Tab!  I'd never been in here before & I am so happy to have someplace close to work for lunch or snacks or breakfast or Tab!  (or wine as they have a great selection) They have a really nice selection of coffees (mmmmbutterscotch) too, so even though I won't get back there this week, they will know my name soon enough!"}
{"text":"I've worked around the corner from this place for years and never ventured in until recently. I am so glad I finally did! I haven't had anything here that wasn't amazing. If you're looking for a sandwich, skip Panera and head over to Laurel Market."}
{"text":"As some folks on here have recommended I went with the #4 in a wrap and while the turkey wasn't like mind blowing, throwing in bacon and some chipotle mayo is guaranteed to please and it did. I think they could really step up their game if they made their own turkey or maybe swapped a chicken salad in with the same stuff."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I came here for lunch today. I ordered the mercado sandwich with no bacon plus avocado on focaccia. The sandwich was in a word- perfection! That and an old-fashion style root-beer ran me $7 - well worth it!   The sandwich was huge - but it was so tasty I tried to eat my second half ( although I was not successful!).   The place is small but we didn't run into any crowds at noon. The service was fairly fast and friendly! There was not a place to eat the sandwich (my reason for 4 stars not 5)...who wants to eat at work ? ...They also close at 3pm so beware if you're craving a late afternoon Laurel Market snack.   I will absolutely be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"I don't know of a better place in Charlotte to get a sandwich or a wrap.  This one for me is an A+.  I've recently introduced (hooked) about 10 people at work onto Laurel Market.  It's at least a 45 minute round trip for us to go for lunch (takeout) but it's worth the time/gas!  So far, my favorite and the crowd favorite is the #4.  Most of us get it on a Spinach or Tomato Basil wrap.  It's incredible!  Turkey/Pepperjack/LTO/Bacon/Chipotle spread... unbeatable."}
{"text":"I gave them 5 stars because i love how simple this place is. A convenient store that happens to make fantastic sandwiches. Everything ive tried I liked.  Try their breakfast sandwiches which you can get any day till 3!"}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long to stop by Laurel Market? Who knows, because this place is fantastic!   Conveniently located off of South Blvd., Laurel Market's menu is chock full of sandwiches of all types - for breakfast, lunch, veg heads, meat lovers, etc. Make sure you pay attention to their deli hours (7 am-3 pm, Mon-Sat) so you don't miss out on a delish breakfast burrito or deli sandwich. And, as others have noted, there are only a few tables out front to hang out and eat - so don't be surprised if you have to take your goods to go.   I tried the CAST sandwich - freshly sliced turkey, green apple, cheddar, honey mustard & lettuce stuffed between two slices of sourdough (my choice of bread). It was super tasty, full of sinus-clearing honey mustard  and plenty of sandwich. With a bag of chips, a can of rootbeer, my big lunch amounted to $9.90. Suffice it to say, I made a meal and a half out of it.   While you're there, check out the other goods - plenty of chips and accompaniments, massive \"Cowboy\" cookies, beverages, a smattering of wine and beer, and more. The staff here are extremely sweet and want to make sure you get exactly what you're looking for. Plus - they offer catering!   I'm absolutely looking forward to stopping by Laurel Market soon to try out more of their sandwich menu and perhaps score a famed breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've had in Charlotte, hands down, no question. Ordered Debbie's Delight. Perfect amount of meat and tons of fresh vegetables. The kicker was the amazing mustard. I don't know what they use but I'd buy a bucket if I could. Far and away best deli in Charlotte, will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"The deli sandwich was so delicious! Great bread and combo. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"In terms of local neighborhood markets, laurel is one of my favorites.  Their sandwiches are good and they also have good soups.  So many great local items for purchase and other homemade goodies!  Just don't expect a place to sit and enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Got delivery (via doordash) and when I say impressed, I mean 100% delicious. Super wide variety of options, including vegetarian. We got a few sandwiches (egg salad with bacon is amazing...and seems to have and hint of yellow curry. Super delicious) and some sides. The black bean salad is delicious! Fresh, yummy and not overly priced. I like that."}
{"text":"A sandwich shop and convenient store-great idea!  They had a huge selection of sandwiches available to order.  I stopped in around lunchtime and it was pretty packed.  They line went quickly and the employees worked hard to ensure no one had to wait.    The man behind the counter was super friendly.  He let me sample the bacon (because I'm picky) before choosing it on my sandwich.  It was delicious.  I had the egg sandwich....let's start by saying I'm from the Midwest...north eastern Ohio to be exact.  While the egg salad may be a terrific choice for some, it just wasn't the style I am used to & will always love.  It was made fresh, it looked good, I'm sure if you enjoy that type...it would be perfect for you.  I just can't hang with the more southern way of making it. It was a little spicy as well, which is fine...but just not for me.  The store was clean, tidy, and organized.  There were many snacks and drinks to choose from.  Overall it was a happy experience."}
{"text":"I'm the kind of jerk that's always subbing stuff. Can you add pickles? No mayo please. Sub tomato for ham? Do you have rye bread? Can you add jalapenos? How about hot sauce? Got a toaster back there? ;D  But the selection of sammich combos at LM is so diverse that it goes right on by the BLTs and Grilled Cheese and starts getting \"weird\" (which is where my tummy starts grumbling) and I don't need to be that person. Which makes me feel good. Until I get a sammich somewhere else.  Eggs fried with curry powder, on sourdough, with pickles and mustard, and sprouts. Awesomely London but light. I love this sammich. It is named something that starts with G.  Veggies can roll with relative ease here, if you're a hummus, egg, egg salad or cheese type. Vegans might struggle a bit, but there looked to be possibilities. I'd love to see tofu make it onto the menu, but hey. There is a breakfast burrito here, and it's 5 bucks. I can't explain why I didn't order it, but I soon will.   There's a ton of nooks and crannies, some full, some not. OMB and growlers from an Asheville brewery are often available. Dingy-chic. Like Common Market without the Kombucha and tchotchkes. I like."}
{"text":"This deli will fool you by the looks of it, but once you taste their sandwiches you will be a fan!  The roast beef sandwich I had was delicious.  If you are looking for a side to go along with it then I recommend the Tabouli salad...fresh!  My husband got the turkey sandwich and he was impressed as well.  Not a sit down place, but a great place to pick up some food for a day at the park."}
{"text":"The Pimento Cheese sandwich is a delicious regional delicacy, the sweetness and moistness of the pimento, the creaminess of the cheese and the hint of spiciness combine to create a simple yet flavorful masterpiece. The Curry Tuna Salad sandwich with avocado is a perfect combination, the unique earthy flavor of the curry combines with the creaminess and nuttiness of the avocado creating an unexpected delight."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is on the top of my list for great sandwiches. Kind of a hidden gem in the Myers Park area. Nice little locally owned store with plenty of wine, beer and some fantastic food.  I'm in love with the #4 on sourdough. Turkey, bacon (the crispiest I've found), pepper jack cheese and a chipotle spread. Oh yeah, throw some lettuce & tomato on there too. I've tried a couple others, all have been good. They serve up some breakfast dishes as well as a daily soup or two. Different breads & wraps to choose from. This place has it going on. It's can get a little hectic in this small space. I don't think there is any official line when ordering. It's also only \"to go\" orders. Not a problem here. Take my sammich and go."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich place in charlotte- I'm hesitant to even write this review because I don't want it to get even more crowded at lunch time! Even though there is almost always a line, they work fast and make fantastic and unique sandwiches.  The ingredients are extremely fresh- the lettuce is crisp, the veggies are crunchy and the tomatoes are some of the most beautiful tomatoes I've ever seen (juicy, plump and actually red!). The place is definitely low key with few frills, but that's part of its charm!  I love everything I've ever had from laurel market but my favorite has to be the #11: smoked turkey, lettuce, tomato, honey mustard, apricot jam, dried currants and walnuts- it sounds weird but is seriously so delicious! So much flavor and great texture from the nuts and currants. I have dreams about this sandwich."}
{"text":"The local is to small but is ok for small market. We order 3 Mercado tortas with avocado, after order we drive to home for eat the tortas.. Omg they forget add bacon and avocado. We drive again for fix the tortas.. and the lady with glasses say.. can I help.. we say yes and explain about bacon and avocado they forget.. and she respond.. any way I don't charge for avocado.. OK but I ask for avocado and bacon.. she try fix the same tortas.. after she fix I open again and the bacon is missing again.. and she respond yes the tortas have bacon.. the other lady tell her... no don't have bacon you forget... and again the same lady with glasses say.. is ok, she open again the same torta and add the bacon... Finally we have the same tortas cold... Please next time for any other customer please make a new one and make the customer be happy. Please if you guys don't know about the cross contamination...  you food is great but please fix this problem for any other customer."}
{"text":"Laurel Market is not like Common Market or Rhino market - it's way more food centered, and it just happens to have some alcohol there :) As we were walking up to the market, there were a couple of guys with dogs sitting outside just talking about life. I think that vibe pretty much sums up how life goes at Laurel Market - things are just laid back. When The Lady and I walked inside, there was a short line, but to our right were about 4 women working super hard making everything from scratch and taking orders as well. We both got sandwiches, I got the #10 which was Black Pepper Ham, Artichoke Spread, Havarti, Cucumber, and Sprouts on wheat bread (but you can choose whatever spread you want). The sandwich came out very quickly, and so did the Lady's. We took our food home, but not before looking down in the cooler and grabbing one of their homemade treats (the homemade treats are about $3.50, whereas the off-shelf ones are like $10. You know my choice. It's not even a choice at that point.)  The sandwich was extremely fresh and flavorful, and the bread was the perfect way to wrap it together. I loved their selection of different menu items to choose from, and they have a written menu alongside their daily specials. Along with food, they also have a good wine selection, convenient store staples like a pops freezer (yes, with King of Pops), and a few other pantry goodies, like a healthy collection of Cloister Honey. They also have a great coffee station as well with a bunch of brew options and all the extras you could want. When we're in the neighborhood looking for a fresh, healthy snack, this looks like a fantastic option that both The Lady and I would be more than happy to revisit."}
{"text":"So yum.  Darn good breakfast burritos, and an INSANE amount of sandwich options (which can be made on white or wheat wraps, wheat or white bread, croissants, focaccia, etc). My current favourite is the g6 (turkey, bacon, avocado, sriracha) wrap, but the nice folks at laurel cater to all those veg and non veg with their fresh ingredients, awesome combinations, and great bread.   I've never been in a line of more than four people, but I've noticed around peak Aveda lunch times, the small store looks quite packed. They start out with a stocked section of pre-made sandwiches, salads, fruit bowls, and even some delicious tabbouleh to help the deli line, but after the lunch rush it's usually fairly wiped out. There's a good selection of drinks, dried snack items, chips, fresh fruit, and ice cream to round out your meal.   After deli hours (3pm), I rarely find myself stopping into Laurel, but they do have assorted OMB growlers, a decent selection of bottled beer, and an eclectic array of wine. (I've found most chilled bottles of white in the $8 - $12 range, but not necessarily with a label I've seen before, sutter home singles, and then a few pricier.. but it always seems to be changing)  Really friendly staff, great lunches, and there is some bench seating out front (I could have sworn there used to be a table, but it wasn't there last time) but I usually take it to-go."}
{"text":"I was in the area and remebered seeing a review on Yelp and wanted to check it out. I arrived shortly after 11:30 and there was a line for the sandwiches. As I waited in the line I read over the chalkboard mean of all they offered, which is a lot. Having never been before I decided to stick with a BLT with Turkey.  The service was just alright. I think because I asked a few questions about two of the sandwiches the lady was annoyed..Sorry, I've never been here.  As I waited for my sandwich I checked out the variety of other things sold in the store, chips, coffee, treats and wine. A cute little place with limited seating. I took my order to go and enjoyed the sandwich very much. I did love the mixture of lettuce, shredded and flat leaf. Gave the sandwich a little texture, and the best part, the bacon was well done and crisp, YUM. I would definitely go back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Picture worthy food. Great place for lunch. Don't let the exterior Deter you, possibly an old 7-Eleven, the food is fresh and so good you'll be happy you stopped"}
{"text":"This place is pretty hidden and looks like it may have been abandoned, but I assure you, it does contain life.....and sandwiches.  We went here on a weekday afternoon and it was surpisingly busy, but there were 4 people behind the deli counter and they were making it rain sandwiches/wraps, so the wait time was minimal.  We got a wrap with turkey, bacon, and pepperjack, and then a crossoint sandwich with turkey, bacon, and ranch.  They were both great, and the bacon was awesome.  The only potential improvement could be to toast the sandwich/wrap a little to melt the cheese, but I just took care of that at home.  I am sure we will make another stop here again soon."}
{"text":"Great market for neat wine, snacks, and lunch!   Beautiful salads with perfect avocados and fresh ingrediants.   I recommend the chicken torta: black beans, chicken, avocado, cheese, tomato, on a bolillo roll. Yum, yum, yum!"}
{"text":"I love \"mom & pop\" style places. This places beats any big chain sandwich place any day of the week. It's a local shop that is a store/market that also has a kitchen and has some of the best sandwiches you can get in Charlotte.   They actually have an option to order and pick up online which is a much needed time saver for this place, especially around lunch. This place can get busy and since it is small - it can get a little congested at times. If you walk in, you might get your sandwich in less than 5 minutes, you might have to wait 15 minutes. But the wait is worth it. The quality of the ingredients are fresh, crispy and oh so tasty.  The variety of sandwiches is vast from the types of bread to the toppings. You won't be disappointed. The sandwiches are huge and very filling.  While you are there you also have the option to pick up local items such as chocolate, beer, jams, pickles, etc.   Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Amazing deli but the ordering process and expedition isn't always the most efficient."}
{"text":"The staff are wonderful. They are quick, efficient and hard working. I always get the Laurel market breakfast sandwich on croissant, or the breakfast Mercado on sourdough. They will serve you breakfast anytime of day. Their brewed coffee is always fresh and delicious. For a time they were no longer brewing my favorite coffee, the coconut cream, after meeting the owner and mentioning this to her she started buying it and brewing it again! I can't thank them enough. They are so accommodating to their customers."}
