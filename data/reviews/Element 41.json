{"text":"Food was excellent. Our wait time and service was a little less than desirable. However. Being that the restaurant is new. We will come back to check it out again."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this restaurant.    The food is good but the waitstaff needs some attention.   On both occasions the service was slow.... we had to ask for bread and when it came the white rolls could have been used for hockey pucks.  Their food is awesome, but they need to train their waitstaff to be more attentive to diners needs... wish them good luck."}
{"text":"We visited just after they opened. The staff is excellent, friendly and accommodating. They asked if we had any suggestions and we told them it was kind of loud and a little too bright inside. The food was excellent however the lobster bisque wasn't as good as I had hoped. I would definitely recommend Element 41 and will go back again"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try someplace new for dinner, and I chose Element 41 and are so glad we did.  We had an early dinner.
My wife and I each had a glass of the house Merlot, which was pretty good.
My wife ordered the Asiago Crusted Chicken and it was phenomenal.  
The entree consisted of the Asiago chicken with a wild mushroom reduction, roasted garlic mash potatoes and spinach. She said that was the best Asiago Crusted chicken she ever had.  She thought that the garlic was a bit too pronounced in the mash potatoes (personal preference).

I chose to have the crab cake appetizer as my dinner.  The appetizer was comprised of two crab cakes, with remoulade and the house slaw. The crab cakes were very good, with a crusty exterior and a soft inner. The remoulade was really exquisite.  The slaw was extremely good with the right balance of acidity, flavor, and texture.
We asked about desert and ordered the Bacon Bourbon Maple Ice Cream. I mean come on, bacon ice cream, who could resist? 
The desert came with with whipped cream and a fresh strawberry.  It was a real treat.  I thought the bacon got a little soggy after being frozen, it could have been better if the bacon was crisper to start with.  The bourbon was there to be sure which I really liked.  Having said all that it was still a very good desert, and I would not hesitate to order it again.
Our server was Melissa, and she took really good care of us, checking up on us frequently to se if everything was ok and if we needed anything.
We definitely will be back.  The atmosphere was very comforting, clean and inviting. It is a hidden gem in Chardon."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service.  Love this place.  I tell everyone it a must stop if you are a foodie!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Food is amazing. Hard pressed to find a better place.  I had the Mahi-Mahi. Perfect. 
Fresh quality.  Good portions. 
Hats off to the chef."}
{"text":"Had lunch there on Tuesday. We both had the pulled pork wrap. It was super good. They put slaw in the wrap with bar-b-que pork and an Asian Sauce. The fries tasted like fresh cut and they were great. The prices were right. The wait staff was cordial and answered all our questions. The interior is tastefully decorated. I would add a few more lights because it seemed a little dark. The wife and I had a great lunch and I am sure we will be returning soon. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal in a clean establishment at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Really delicious!  My husband and I got fish tacos and Brussels as an app and asiago crusted chicken and sea scallops for dinner.  Our waitress was very lovely and helpful with our choices and the food was served promptly and beautifully.  The portions were perfect, presentation was on point and the flavors were unique.  Great choice for a date night.  Only issue we had was that it was a little loud.  Thrilled to have another great choice in our hometown!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. I've haven't been overly impressed either times I have come here, but nothing has been bad either. I got the veggie sandwich the first time. It was very simple and lacked some flavor. It felt like something I could have easily made at home. The second time I came here I got the chicken caprese salad. This was much better then the sandwich, but still was not anything to rave about. The restaurant was clean and the wait staff was kind."}
{"text":"Good service.  Food is awesome.  Cute little place.  Vegetarian friend.  Try the brunch on the weekends."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened on Chardon Square in Sept 2017. They specialize in locally sourced ingredients and have a great eclectic (for Chardon) menu:

We have been there once for a birthday dinner...and we will return soon.
We ordered the Maple Bourbon Glazed Brussel Sprouts as a starter: deconstructed with bacon bits, locally harvested maple syrup and homemade red onion pickle. YUM !
We also had the Grilled Tuscan Flank Steak (medium rare: came out perfect), Baby Kale Caesar salad, Seared Sea Scallops and Seared Bay of Fundy Salmon. The risotto with the scallops was perfect, the grits that came with the salmon creamy and the broccoli steamed to perfection. Everything was delicious and the portions just right: the 3 of us could share \" best cheesecake you've ever had\".
Per local newspaper they have: Happy Hour Tuesday through Friday 3-6pm in the bar, specials such as Taco Tuesdays (4-11pm) 3 tacos for $8 instead of $10 with $5 sangrias; Wing Wednesday (home smoked wings) starts at 4pm and Weekend brunch on Sat & Sundays from 9am to 2pm

Good luck and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food and service were wonderful. We were greeted and seated quickly. Our food was simply fantastic. It looked as good as it tasted. We had asiago chicken for our meal, and the glazed brussel sprouts were amazing. I never thought I'd eat brussel sprouts, but gave them a try based on the description. This place is worth checking out, we will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent experience!  We had dinner here Saturday and we were all very pleased with the food and the service.  I had the Mushroom bisque to start, everyone else had the French Onion soup special.  My bisque was SO decadent.  I opted for the cup but wished I had ordered a bowl....I would get that again and again.  Apparently the French Onion soup was a big hit as well.  

As for dinner, my husband had the Center cut Filet medallions over mashed potatoes and spinach which he said was AMAZING - the beef was so tender he could cut it with his fork, and he said the demi-glace was fantastic.  My father in law had the Smoked Brisket dinner which also came with mashed potatoes along with Broccoli.  I had the Salmon over Gouda grits with Broccoli as well.  The broccoli was steamed perfectly, the salmon was cooked to perfection and the grits were delicious.  We all devoured our meals and said that we would come back again.   They also have a nice wine list...if you are a cab fan I highly recommend the Quilt Cabernet.

Next time we hope to save some room for dessert."}
{"text":"Cute place. Great wait staff, very attentive and attune to special food allergies and requests."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was excellent, the prices are in the normal range. I would recommend this establishment to any of my friends !"}
{"text":"First time here. Nice atmosphere, not too loud. Food was excellent and very reasonably priced.  Gazpacho soup wonderful. Fried chicken sandwich great. For dessert our server recommended the Heavenly Pudding.  Was one of the best desserts I've ever had.  Out of this world !! Will come back just for that.  Great place."}
