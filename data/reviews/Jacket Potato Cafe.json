{"text":"Amazing. Delicious. Friendly. 

Cute cafe atmosphere, we were greeted immediately, there was only one customer in there when we were, a couple people came in while we were eating. The one downside was how long it took.. about 10 minutes. The potato was hot and delicious. I got a baked potato with cheese and bacon. The cheese was not stingy, neither was the bacon. The bacon was DELICIOUS. There was only one man working there, SO friendly. Always smiling. 

They also have cookies and such. Large variety of drinks. Quiet. Clean.
Will definitely come again."}

Well, this is one of those times.......

Baked potatoes are no longer the also-ran items, they are now the main event.

After reading a review in the old-school media, aka The Toronto Star I added this to the mental \"when next in the area\" list. 

Mission accomplished.......

Had lunch here yesterday, a chili potato, one of about seven or so variations.

These are no \"small potatoes\"    heh....

Generous size, with adequate but not indecent amount of chilli and cheese."}

Jacket Potato Cafe serves baked potatoes with various toppings or you can create your own.. it is not the most original idea, the main different is the crunchy, crispy skins of jacket potato compare to regular baked potato.

Here the potatoes are baked in a King Edward Classic 25 potato-baking convection oven imported from England for 2 hours.. which resulted in the crispness of the skin.. and you suppose to eat that too just like the Brits!

The most basic topping  is with the Cheese ($4.99). Great potato taste.... wish there is more cheese :P

I would suggest to give Jacket Potato Cafe a try if you are in the Upper Beach area. And remember to eat the skin too!!"}
