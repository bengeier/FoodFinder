{"text":"Ate at Frank's last night.  First time as eat in.  Small but comfortable.  DH had western omelet with potatoes and toast plus iced tea.  I had a small house salad and a falaffel wrap and iced tea.  Food was great and DH omelet plate was gigantic.  My falaffel  wrap was the best I've ever had. The salad was delicious especially the balsamic  vinegrette.   Tonight DH was in our local grocery store the owner say DH and said hellw.  Amazing since DH had only been in his restaurant twice!  The place and the staff make you really feel at home.  They seem to know everybody who comes in.  This is our new go to restaurant.  We are happy patrons of a wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"They have been open for a couple of weeks, it isn't very fancy inside, and since the AC didn't seem to be working I would recommend carryout. As you might guess from their name they have specialize in middle eastern food. They have all the other deli items - corned beef, reubens, gyros, etc. Check it out if you are in Detroit Shoreway, they were super fast."}
{"text":"Frank's is amazing! I went there for dinner recently, craving an omelet because I had seen one on the menu in the restaurant in my office building - for $12. At Frank's, I got a spinach feta omelet for $2.99 with just the right amount of feta, and fresh - not frozen- shredded potatoes on the side with a nice crisp top. My husband got the falafel sandwich. I have had this before - it is just the right amount of moist and the accompanying sauce is very tangy. This place us not over the top in atmosphere, but the dining room is bright and clean without annoying blaring easy listening music. I highly recommend it if you want quality for a really remarkably low price."}
{"text":"Mushy undercooked Falafel. Dry Beef Shwarma loaded with gristle. Hummus portions too small. Paper thin dry Pita.  I'm beginning to wonder about Cleveburghers and their knowledge of what good food is. Nearly every Yelp review is always 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Gordon Square. We were greeted with a smile, our server was extremely friendly, and the food was delicious.  My mom had the vegetarian platter I had The falafel wrap all for $20 with tip! As we were leaving both gentlemen that were in the kitchen thanked us for our business. It was such a simple gesture but it really went along way. Definitely going back and definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Middle Eastern food (did not try any other here) is very well done.  Uncommonly fresh.  Salads made from scratch when you order, for example.  The Lebanese dressing and spicing is uncommonly good.  Better in my book then other local restaurants serving similar food.  However, the real reason to come are the prices.  Don't believe this place is still in business.  You cannot go wrong.  The other reason to come is the ambiance.  Frank's is a 60\" drive-in. Come at night for the light show.  It's a blaze of light.  The neon red sign alone is priceless.  Dress well.  The 60's un-insulated glass windows (60% of the walls in the place) make it a comfortable +64F on non-sunny days for wearing your coat while you eat. In the summer, do take out.  The characters eating there, and passing by, can be interesting indeed.  Oh yes, they serve corned beef, omelets, rubens, and plenty of breakfast and lunch sandwiches, too.  Finally, you never go away hungry.  Every dish is generous to a fault."}
{"text":"The food is GREAT! It's a clean and friendly atmosphere.Highly recommend Frank's Falafel House!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in town, wide variety + inexpensive and fast. Go here! We go here lots it's super effin yummy xP!!!! Especially to hang and the coffee is good broo. Starbucks who? Lmao falafel is crunch and good too"}
{"text":"Not upscale. Just good Mediterranean food at a great price. The tabouli was wonderful and the shawarma platter was terrific. The hot sauce will knock your socks off!!"}
{"text":"Ya know how at some places the food varies depending on the person who's cooking that day? Not at Frank's. I've lived down the street for about 6 months and I can't tell you how many times I've eaten the exact same thing. It always tastes and looks like the first time. Great chicken shwarma, kibbie, falafel and grape leaves. Whenever I'm getting out of work late, don't have anything in the frig, don't have time ,don't feel like cooking or spending $$$$$,  Frank's Falafel is my go to spot."}
{"text":"Ok. I know that people are going to say 'There are better falafel places in cleveland... the falafels are pretty good but not mind blowing... yada yada yada... '   However, you have to rate this place for what it is - a fan-friggin-tastic diner-y place that does the whole middle eastern + breakfast diner fare to cheap awesomeness. Basically, on the food for price thing, this places hits it square on. Deliciousness, without breaking the bank.  Also, I want to award something to the mad genius who came up with the falafel omelette. Seriously. Falafel. Cooked inside an omelette. Mind blown. Slather some harrissa hot sauce and some tzatziki on the eggs, and enjoy!  Also their baklava - home made by the owners wife - are amazing! They hit this great medium in between the whole too crunchy/soggy, too sweet/bland, too much filling/phyllo dough (?) that places supposedly a lot better can only strive to reach.   I am def going back to get breakfast once (or a hundred time) again!"}
{"text":"Decent Mediterranean food but I wouldn't say it's the best in Cleveland.  Taza and Maha's are head and shoulders above this place but Frank's is in a different league.  It's a no frills joint in a crappy neighborhood.  The falafel wrap and the shish tawook wraps with both on the bland side.  No real standout seasoning to the food.  And the previous poster is right...the falafel is mushy.  The hummus and pita, however, were delicious.  They make their hummus with lemongrass and it was a nice twist on the flavor.  Price are well, dirt cheap, for Mediterranean.  And they have a breakfast special on the weekend that cannot be beat:  2 eggs, bacon or sausage, toast and hash browns for only $2.50.  You can't eat at Big Egg for that price."}
{"text":"Frank's is our go-to place for a regular breakfast or lunch.  If we can't decide where to go to eat, it's our default setting.  Why?  Because the food is always maximum delicious, the staff is very friendly, and the prices are low-low-low.  Breakfast?  A variety of excellent omelets are the stars -- my husband dies for the corned beef, I am fond of the spinach and feta, while my son cannot be pried away from the farm omelet, which has everything in it but the kitchen sink.  The golden hash browns are superb. I mix some of Frank's own homemade hot sauce into my ketchup, slide a little on the hash browns, and it's zap! pow! bam!  I am unable to pry the secrets of the hot sauce from Frank, even after much begging, but I know it includes jalapeno and garlic.  Yummm...  Now on to lunch.  The falafel is very good, the hummus is excellent, there are a variety of burgers, but for me, it's gotta be the gyro.  Frank's gyro is a Platonic 10 out of 10.  Why?  1) He specially grills the onions for me (just ask), 2) he grills the gyro meat, and 3) the homemade tzaziki sauce rocks my world. Ask for the hot sauce on the side, dab on as needed.  The Greek salad with added chicken is also terrific -- loaded with fresh feta and olives.  It's covered with a mountain of Frank's chicken shwarma which is delicately spiced. You can try his fatoosh dressing (lemon with lots of mint) or the balsamic which comes with it - both are terrific.  If you are looking for a friendly, reliable, yummy standard place for breakfast or sandwiches in the Detroit-Shoreway area, you need look no more."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all these stellar reviews. The grapeleaves I gave a second try and they were hands down the worst I've ever had. Mushy with no taste whatsoever. Their rice isn't even close to pilaf, its cheap. None of their ingredients are fresh or authentic. Its Aldi's. So considering that, its actually not a good price at all. The salads are good. We tried the big plate, the one on the front of the menu for 16.99, thinking that's their specialty it would be good. Nope, very underwhelming. No flavor at all in the grapeleaves and the shawarma was both confusing and tasteless.   I would recommend making your own grapleaves or find a friend with a Lebanese grandma, see what good leaves really are."}
{"text":"This is where we go when we want a great sandwich at a fast food price.  Just a corner joint, diner atmosphere with good food.  The inside is clean but not fancy.  When I don't want to cook and don't feel like dealing with a fancy hour dinner.  Corned Beef Sandwich Ruben's Philly AMAZING Chicken Philly  ( my favorite )  Chicken Shishtawook  Sandwich          In House marinated chicken chunks, lettuce, tomato and their homemade garlic    sauce in a pita. Fallaffel Sandwich or platter"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: the location is a huge plus for me, given that I can walk over in my PJ's in a minute.  I've been here many times for their gyro skillet breakfasts and daily specials. The food is consistently hearty and delish (greasy spoon standards). Cost for breakfast meals are very reasonable.  Service is quick and friendly, nice folk from the area."}
{"text":"THE spot for falafel in Cleveland, diner style and a little greasy just like it should be. Quick and cheap. Beyond recommended for take out which only takes ten minutes no matter what time you call. My go to lunch jam. Franks forever"}
{"text":"Considering it's down the street from my job I was a bit surprised to realize I had never been to Franks. In dire search of some hummus and a salad I entered this establishment on a cold winter day. I was warmly welcomed by two ladies and placed an order to go right away. I think my salad and hummus took all of 6 minutes which is amazing for me since I was in a crunch for time.   My buffalo chicken salad was lacking some chicken, I think they definitely could have been a tad more generous but I was starving and not in the mood to argue. The hummus was amazing, so fresh I felt like they were in the back mashing up the chickpeas as I ordered .   The inside of the establishment needs a major and I mean MAJOR overhaul. It's outdated and gross, not welcoming nor is it inviting . Price wise it's a great spot, but with all the competition they have with west 25th and Gordon square I expected more of a Shabbang from Franks and unfortunately for me they fell short."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Frank's.  I went for lunch on a Friday afternoon.  I was seated immediately.  The server was very nice.  The place was clean, nothing fancy.  I ordered a small order of tabouli and the Chicken Shwarma sandwich roll.  My food arrived fairly quickly.   The tabouli arrived chilled, but a little bit dull.  I thought that maybe it had been leftover from the previous day, until I tasted it.  It was pretty decent, served with 1/2 pita pocket.  The sandwich roll was made to order.  The chicken was a little sparse and non-descript.  It had a decent flavor, but was overpowered by the garlic mayo, lettuce, and mushy tomato slices.  This was fairly ok for lunch, would I bypass Nate's Deli to go back to Frank's.....probably not.   There was definitely a steady stream of customers and phone orders, so this is a popular place."}
{"text":"Not bad! From the outside we thought this could be bad, but we had a friend's recommendation and thought we may as well give it a try. Expect some decent food at rock bottom prices and leave the tuxedo at home."}
{"text":"My partner, two teens and I went here last night for dinner.  The service was amazing and the food was so good!  The owner/chef came out to check on us twice in addition to all the attention we go from our server.  We never wanted for anything.  We ordered grape leaves, a chicken shwarma dinner, a kibbie dinner, hummus, and baba ganoush which we shared among the four of us, and had enough to take some home.  We were all delighted by the quality, freshness and  taste of the food.  Everything was made to order, but was still quick to arrive and more than satisfying.  The building is not fancy, but it is very clean.  To me, the caliber of food and service are much more important than elaborate decor.    The prices are more than reasonable for the portion size and quality of food.  Our family of four at alot of food and had some left over but  the bill was less than $60 including the tip.  I know for a fact you can't do that at some of the fancier looking places where the decor is better than the food.  Here, you definately get your money's worth and then some."}
{"text":"love this place! fast, delicious food. friendly staff. cheap food. diner type place. I usually get take out but do sit in once in a while for breakfast  eggs need to quickly get from the grill to my mouth!"}
{"text":"I stopped by on this snowy night to grab some takeout and very happy I did. I ordered right away, grape leaves and a falafel wrap. The owner asked if I was a vegetarian, when I confirmed my mostly veggie tastes he shared he usually remembers his veg customers and will often make special veg only dishes, alas, none today.  In talking to him my favorite quote was, \"people either come here because they love me or they love my food.\" I couldn't agree more, I love both.  The grape leaves are fantastic and at 6 for $3.99 they're a steal. The falafel has a hint of something, perhaps cinnamon, that gives the wrap a unique touch. He shaped and fried them in front of me and I'm happy to say the falafel isn't dry as you'll often find. The tahini sauce is great. While the toppings of shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes are a bit generic, the falafel doesn't need to be covered up and at $3.50 also an amazing deal.  I purchased a delicious, thoughtfully prepared meal and definitely plan on going back. The owner is wonderful; the food delicious, Frank's Falafel House is a welcome addition to my neighborhood."}
{"text":"On the corner of 65th and Franklin.  in Gordon Square. The food is excellent the restaurant looks great inside. We were greeted with a smile, our server was extremely friendly, and the food was delicious.  I had the vegetarian platter. for $9.00. It was exceptional. I've been to numerous middle east restaurants. Its great.  Definitely going back and definitely recommend this place.  The outside looks like a problem ,  as the driveways on the corner are blocked. I don't know why. I'd open that up and see if I could get car  traffic sitting at the light . But there's plenty of parking and outdoor seats too. I see they have breakfast too. I,m probably going to use them more often. As I hate that traffic jam on 65th and Detroit."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Frank's. My dad randomly found it a few years ago while doing some work in the neighborhood and the fam has been coming here ever since. We usually get the Franks special Mediterranean platter for 2.  It comes with some schwarma-in-pita, falafel, grape leaves and your choice of hummus/baba and tabouli/fatoush. Everything is good and fresh. The garlic sauce and the tzatziki sauce are the highlights of the meal. Ask for extra.  Prices are reasonably low at $10 or less for an entree and the platter for 2 is $21.99.   Definitely worth checking out. Bonus that they have their very own (large) parking lot because it's near a trendy area where I'm sure parking is a pain."}
{"text":"Franks gets 5 stars in my book.  Not because it's the best falafel in the city, not because it's the cleanest restaurant, not because it has the best staff.  (It has 2 of the 3 above though).  The 5 stars are for their amazing hot sauce.  It's seriously so good it makes me cry."}
{"text":"Best tabouli I have ever had! And the baba is to die for ! The staff is super friendly as well.  I moved so I don't get to go here as often anymore but anytime I'm nearby I stop in!"}
{"text":"Great for takeout but I think I'll take em down to a three star.   Why?   Those wonky hours man! Sometimes you'll show up thinking, \"They're diner-ish, it's Sunday afternoon, they're probably open!\" And nooope. No bueno. It's sad times.   But like I said, their cheap, great for takeout--which saved me from a killer hangover the other day. One improvement to the gyros would be some really good hot  sauce."}
{"text":"Frank's is the ultimate Cleveland diner. Crazy cheap and delicious breakfast and good Greek food. The breakfast burrito is fantastic, they make their own hot sauce. Get it.  I've been several times and the service is always good. Friendly waitresses, food comes out quickly. You can't beat the price or the breakfasts. They have great biscuits and gravy, too, or just get a biscuit on the side.  Their only flaw is that they're not open late night."}
{"text":"Like the other  post, I didnt even know this place existed really, i drive past a couple of times and decided to stop in  one day for  a quick lunch. I  usually go to Aliddans when i have a taste for falafel, but  since this place is much closer i am  considering  a switch!!! their fafalel wrap is so good! get it with a bit of hummus in it.. YUM"}
{"text":"Did not like it, food was not warm and did not seem very friendly.  The kitchen did not look hygienic and seen food laying around the floor."}
{"text":"Frank's has the best hummus and house made hot sauce in the world. Their gyros are average but if you add the hot sauce, they're really good.  I had their breakfast once and it was awful.  I'll stick to the hummus and gyros!"}
{"text":"In the area for a bit of work I stopped at Franks for a breakfast sandwich before starting the grind. Ordered a bacon egg and cheese on white (bacon was a dollar extra). Only took about 4 minutes for my order to be completed and totaled $6 with a bottle of apple juice, pre tip. The sandwich was satisfactory, the eggs cooked competently and to my surprise, there was a side of hash browns in my container as well. Browns could use a bit of salt, but I can't complain because it was takeout."}
{"text":"The food is great and the menu is varied enough for anyone, but the TERRIFIC service and wonderful friendly atmosphere they set make this a great place!!  Give them a try - you'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and reasonable prices. Always a smile when you walk in the door. Like to stop in for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great and cheap gyros! Cant beat the quality! Good greek for the west side!"}
{"text":"Lived in Ohio city for over 8 years and never had been here, it is delicious and the customer service is outstanding!  My kiddos love the pancakes and I love their hummus and gyros!"}
{"text":"Was skeptical at first but was pleasantly surprised. The falafel and kibbee were both delicious. My advice when ordering the wraps is that you can never go wrong with extra tomatoes & cucumbers. Extra napkins are recommended if you get extra sauce. Fast, friendly, and tasty. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by Frank's Falafel House after hearing a great review from a friend.  Having been spoiled by the great middle eastern rrestaurants in Dearborn and eastern Michigan, it's been hard to find a good middle eastern restaurant that can even compare, here in Cleveland.  The place is rather cute- nice people, old diner looking place. We walked in- it was rather empty, but it was nice to sit down right away.  I think this place would probably be better for breakfast. They had quite the extensive menu for it. However, we were there for dinner. We ordered some baba ghannouj and a schwarma platter.  It was alright. I mean, the garlic butter that came out with the warm pita...wasn't the super garlicky butter that I normally like...but it was okay. The baba was okay and so was the schwarma.   So, all in all, Frank's is an okay place to stop by if you have a craving for middle eastern food. It's nothing like Dearborn, but the people are nice and the food is decent.  I think next time I'm going to try their breakfast..."}
{"text":"Frank's Falafel House has surprised me twice.   The first time was when I happened to drive by it a few weeks ago to see that it even existed.   Tucked away on the corner of Franklin and W. 65th a mere spitting distance from the rest of the Gordon  Square Arts district.  Needless to say, the glowing red sign beckoned, and I made a mental note to stop by to check it out.   The second time Frank's surprised me was when I finally got a chance to stop in for meal.  Walking in, it seems in all regards like any other old-timey family restaurant (like the few that still exist on Lorain Road in Fairview Park).  The dining room, while small, was VERY clean and orderly.  We sat down and were immediately brought menus and had our drink orders taken.  The server was attentive and friendly, and he was happy to answer questions about the menu.   Speaking of the menu, I was actually surprised to see as many non-Middle Eastern items as there were.  Mostly breakfast stuff, but there were burgers and such as well.  I might describe it as greasy spoon with a really heavy Middle Eastern bent.  Very reasonable prices, in some cases, surprisingly low, but this wasn't reflected in the food.  My gyro was pretty good.  Not the best around around here, but a decent showing.  I will say that the pita the gyro was wrapped in seemed like the freshest I've ever had- soft, doughy, delicious.   The Falafel sandwich on the other hand was excellent.  The patties were cooked perfectly and the tahini dressing was a perfect complement.  It was only $3.50 too!  The wife's chicken shawarma platter was good as well.  The accompanying hummus was top notch too. Overall, we were really happy we stopped in.   While Frank's is a little bit of a hike from home, I will seriously consider making the trip when I get a taste for Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"For all intents and purposes this is a 5-Star \"Diner review\". I ventured here on a mission to try their breakfast- past the hipster donut and beer place, the new age \"brunch\" spots, and even past several \"good value\" places, all so I could arrive at what looks like from the outside to be a revamped Pizza Hut from the 90s. But sometimes those are the best places!  And Franks really delivers- it's a classic mom & pop style diner that serves Mediterranean food alongside traditional American fare. The menu is large and varied and they have seasonal specials such as the delicious sweet potato pancakes we had.  The food we ordered- a western skillet and a veggie omelet with gyro meat added- came out hot, not too oily, and delicious. It was actually super impressive how fresh and well cooked everything was. The staff (who told us how she personally made the cinnamon butter for the cakes) was attentive and nice.  All in all this is a diamond in a sort of rough neighborhood- a place that shouldn't be overlooked in the face of tomorrow's next big fad restaurant!"}
{"text":"It's Frank's Falafel House.  With a name like that, you never know what you're going to get.  So obviously I was intrigued.  What was it?  Good Mediterranean food for cheap.  It's not the nicest establishment, and you could probably tell that from the name, the location, and the outside of the building.  But don't let that scare you away, the food is good and I can see why it has its regulars.  Trying to stay away from the burger and fries lunch? I recommend a half order of both hummus and tabouli.  Takeout ordering is a little awkward because there's nowhere to stand."}
{"text":"Slow day at work, lack of motivation on a Monday morning, means that I am on Yelp spreading the good word. The falafel here is pretty good. A reviewer said Frank's is in a crappy neighborhood which I don't agree with. I really like this neighborhood. The breakfast is very cheap, the way it should be. You can even get just one egg for 75 cents. Mediterranean combined with American diner breakfast is a good way to start a Saturday."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Had this great dish called Fuele Mesdames (I think) that was wonderful with pita bread and tahini . And such a bargain! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Friendly, warm diner atmosphere with some of the area's best Middle Eastern food. Been there many times. Consistently good."}
{"text":"We unexpectedly and randomly ended up here while visiting Cleveland.  We had a falafel sandwich and gyro.  Both were very good.  Being from the NY area, our standards for falafel are high and this place was pretty legit.  They have their own lot, so free parking is a plus."}
{"text":"Detroit shoreway diner with free wifi. All the elements needed for me to eat and work. I had the mushroom burger special of the day. Cooked to order, tasted great and with great service. Place is casual, clean, no frills, and with wifi this will be my go to place to work if I'm in this area."}
{"text":"'Twas a lazy Sunday and was looking for something brunch-y. Pulled out the yelp and came across one of yelp elite's PW raving review on frank's falafel house. This guy knows his stuff so I was convinced this was one of Cleveland's dining gems. Praise Jesus it has it's own parking lot. Had a very reasonably priced range of American breakfast and Mediterranean fare. Ended up getting a steak dish with hash browns (could have used more meat, hash browns were not greasy at all and very tasty) and a fattoush salad (very fresh tasting and used greens in the salad). And of course we run into PW there also. Servers were attentive and quick. Would definitely return"}
