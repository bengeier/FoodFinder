{"text":"Family business!!! I found Kings Cafe on Yelp when I visited Cox to return equipment. It was closed but the young man and women who own this nice spot let me in. They were preparing a catering order today so I was lucky to get in and get just what I wanted. Greek salad and chicken soup was delicious. Atmosphere a little sterile but hey, it's about the food and it was very clean. Where else can you get borscht? The soup was hand made and their 1 and a half year old was well behaved.   There's a forest of fast food in north Rancho near the 95. Pass those uninteresting spots and find this special place next to Citi Trends across the large parking lot. The food belongs to the people!"}
{"text":"Offered vegan options which was perfect for my friend. The place is nice and clean and has a family run vibe to it. Great place for a quick and healthy bite"}
{"text":"Two words...Fig Glaze!!!!  I have been anxiously awaiting this place to open and somehow I missed out their opening last week! No worries because I got to visit this morning and I'm super happy with what I experienced.  Living down the road just South of here...it's slim pickin' on fresh, healthy eats...which I find super odd because hello?!?!? it's the Medical District! Look no further King's Cafe to the rescue!   Welcomed with a smile and hello, this modern clean new cafe offers free WifI with breakfast and lunch style options. Seating is for 58 so bring plenty friends and coworkers.   I chose the Vegan Sandwich which I opted for a tomato wrap. They have a choice of whole grain rolls, pita, sliced bread and tortillas in tomato, spinach, or regular. I don't like bread (yes I'm weird) but I can def get down on a tortilla. The wrap was very large, fresh and bursting with flavor. I am glad that they suggested the Fig Glaze because I'm truly in love with it. I also asked for some hummus to be inside of it and very glad I did. The Fig Glaze and hummus made it creamy and savory and accompanied the crispy fresh veggies perfectly.   As they were building my dream wrap, I noticed that even though this cafe is new...it is SUPER clean and organized. The large open kitchen was thoughtfully planned, everything has it's place. No clutter in sight. Something like this makes me at ease the food I am purchasing to fuel my body comes from a great business. This seems like a family run cafe from the few minutes I was there and the sense of pride was truly apparent.   I asked about the soups and unfortunately the Picante (vegan) one was still being prepared, but I did show up at like 9 am so that's totally understandable! I will be back!  I'm not a fan of smoothies but after a few questions...I was anxiously to try one. I chose the mixed berry but they did offer a mango or a strawberry banana also. I got to choose between apple juice or orange juice as my base. I chose orange juice. Then they offered soy or almond mylk to add. Heck yes! I opted for almond mylk. To some it up it seriously taste like an Orange Julius from my childhood. It took me a few hours to place my finger on what it reminded me of but yep...it does! It's tartness is not sour nor is this smoothie sweet. Exactly how I like a smoothie and I'm glad I made the choice selections.   All and all I'm very happy to see King's Cafe open. I can't wait to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Glad to have King's Cafe as a lunch option in the area where most of the alternatives involve a drive-thru window. KC's breakfast and lunch menu is well-priced and the portions are more than fair. I appreciate that they use fresh produce and offer vegetarian and vegan items- the vegan wrap in particular is a good choice, with a tasty fig glaze. I was also thrilled to find the Julien sandwich, which riffs on a Russian dish of creamed mushrooms. Location is small but clean, and only open on weekdays."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. The Greek salad is wonderful. The restaurant is small and quaint and very clean! The menu has a variety of food from sandwiches, smoothies, salads etc. the customer service is great! Delivery or pickup or eat in options are good."}
{"text":"I was a little excited to find out there was a cafe opening within my neighborhood. When I finally had the chance to try it out, the food and the beverages were amazing. I felt like they were having some tough competition with the Starbucks nearby. I managed to convince some of my friends to check out this place, especially coffee lovers, and they agreed that this was one of the best family-owned cafes in Vegas. But don't take my word for it, come check the place out. Try any of their specialties of the week, such as the pumpkin soup or the pomegranate banana smoothie."}
{"text":"Great homemade hibiscus smoothies with banana! The sandwiches are fresh and the place is perfectly clean. Would come back and try their specials soon. I live in Summerlin and it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. The Raspberry White Chocolate Latte was amazing. The staff is very sweet and they make you feel very welcomed. Had the breakfast turkey and cheese croissant, they let you add all the veggies you want. I bought 2 croissants, a latte, a large chicken soup, and a ginger ale for $15. It's very affordable and WAY Better than Starbucks. Will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Just had the Julienne sandwich, seriously the best sandwich ever and everyone should try it's Staff is friendly and prices are very reasonable!! Everyone  give this local cafe a shot and support small businesses!!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in the most unassuming shopping center on north Rancho, but don't let the location fool you. The food is good. I had a veggie wrap with hummus, and after much discussion with the owners, decided to try the borscht. I'm not a fan of red beets, but this soup was amazing. The sweetness of the beets was tempered by tomatoes and an earthy-but-not-too-salty broth. Head down for lunch and show them some love!"}
{"text":"I am in awe at how amazing they're smoothies are. Hibiscus and Banana Smoothie taste so good. This is like a family business. The omelette I must say I give it more than 5 stars. They're customer service is on point. I hope your business expand. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Our lunch group all had great sandwiches, smoothies, salads, and soup. They were really quick getting all of us through! Thank you!"}
