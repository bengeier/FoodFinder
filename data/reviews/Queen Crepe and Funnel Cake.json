{"text":"This is, by far the most amazing Pho you will ever have.

I found this place by accident during the Beaches Jazz Festival. I knew I was in good hands when the the proprietor told me that I couldn't order the spring rolls, because their supplier in her home country had run out of stock. Authenticity!

The Pho broth is 100% MSG free, and I kid you not, the soup is OPAQUE, it's so hearty.

The decor is cheesy but cute, the walls are painted black, and there are hand-written inspirational quotes in pale-coloured...markers?

Aside from having to pay for tea separately, it's pretty much perfect.

Oddly enough, I've never tried their crepe or funnel cake. I hear from other frequenters that it's delicious too."}
{"text":"This place serves the freshest comfort food ever. Everything is made from scratch: shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce, Pho, mango smoothies, and the most wonderful mint lemonade! The owner is sweet as can be and you can tell she puts a lot of love in her food. This is a real gem on East Queen Street."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch the other day because the window sign said they had a pho and spring roll special a few days earlier. Would have gone long ago but I don't know what a funnel cake is and I didn't want crepes. I wanted to eat a quick and cheap meal just to try it out. 
The place was empty, but still welcoming and I enjoyed the scattered inspirational quotes on the 'all-blackboard' walls. 
The owner, Alice, said there was just a pho special but I could have a 'small' (it was plenty) bowl for $5. 
It was delicious! I'm guessing this is what mom's home cooking would taste like in Vietnam. Really thick, lots of meat and noodle, and the broth was 'all stock, not made with bouillion' she said. 
Friendly, good service, good food, great price. No complaints."}
