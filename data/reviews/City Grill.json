{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers, the burgers here rival Tessaro's.  Make sure you also check out their grilled wings. Some of the best wings in the city.  **Update - service has been decreasing in quality lately. Be prepared for loud/rude/drunk and/or slow service in exchange for the good burgers and wings."}
{"text":"The Ultimate Burger; served with brie and horseradish.  Cooked to PERFECTION. I love burgers more then anyone I know, I eat them everywhere and anywhere, and this one of the most superior burgers I have ever had.  The atmosphere is really mellow, especially for a joint on the southside. The menu is simple, and everything seems to be done with care.  My server was great, a bit cold,but fast and accurate. Just the way a server should be."}
{"text":"The bleu cheese hamburgers are really their hit item.  The bree cheese pastrey puff is also very good, and comes with a raspberry sauce.  They have a nice interior with brick walls.  Great place to eat dinner.  You can also eat outside, though I never did.  Very tasty."}
{"text":"I'm surprised it has taken me this long to try out City Grill.  I think the South Side has some excellent restaurants, but I always felt it was missing a middle of the road, good meal, doesn't need to be an occasion to eat there sort of place....  City Grill is that sort of place.  Great burgers.  I'm not a burger expert, and I won't make comparison claims about these guys...but I really enjoyed mine.  I had the Brie cheese and horseradish burger.  It was great, would order it again (BUT I had huge food envy of everyone else with their bacon cheeseburgers.)  Burger was good exactly to order.  Fries were good as well.  Service was also very good - bartenders and waiters alike.   This restaurant is a solid place to enjoy a great burger and some beers - usually without the usual South Side Bridge and Tunnel crowd that pack all the other bars."}
{"text":"Ate here on the last night of our (Mikie, Sarah & I) Fatty Weekend trip.  We had been walking and knew we needed food before starting out drinking shenanigans but probably chose this place because of the bar we could sit at.  Good grub and a cool bartender that was attentive and had a nice dry wit.  I had a tasty burger and even more tasty Jack and Coke...or 3.  I don't quite remember.  I think there were some shots too.  Right? It's probably best that I don't remember..."}
{"text":"The quintessential Toronto urban experience it's not, but it is a nice place to stop in for a civilized lunch when you're worn out from shopping.    There's something about coming into a restaurant frazzled and carrying too many bags, and leaving calm, fed, and sophisticated-feeling.  It doesn't take much - a cocktail, a sandwich & salad, and some good service.    I wouldn't go out of my way to meet people here, but they get an extra star for the really nice waitress who didn't give me the hairy eyeball for lunching & drinking alone."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner around 7 on a Wednesday and it was very dead. I ordered the blue cheese burger after hearing that it is very similar to Tessaro's. The only similarity that it shares is that they are both grilled on a wood fired grill. The burger was unbelievably bland, the char grilling made the exterior very bitter, and the bun was rather tasteless. For my choice of side I went with fries. I was excited when they first arrived, they looked like they were going to be crunchy and delicious, unfortunately they were greasy and limp. The only positive aspect of the meal was our very friendly and attentive server. I'm not sure if I will give City Grill another shot, I just know that if I do I will skip the burger."}
{"text":"Found right underneath the City Grille, it appears to try to be the upscale cousin of the tenant upstairs.  Whereas Mr. Greenjeans (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mr-greenjeans-restaurant-and-bar-toronto) appears to be brighter, cheerier and more family-oriented, City Grille attempts to bring some finer dining experience to the Eaton Centre (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/toronto-eaton-centre-toronto) with a darkened dining room and entrees that have words like \"Supreme\" in them.  The tap list is huge if you only want Creemore, Moosehead, or Rickard's White, and the wine list features ten or so wines from both the red and white side.  Note that the reds are sub-categorized as \"Light\", \"Cuddly\" and \"Structured\".  You try and not giggle when ordering a cuddly shiraz.  Again, like Mr. Greenjeans above, there's nothing brilliant but nothing horribly wrong here.  I'd say it's more of a case of a place desperately trying to punch above its weight."}
{"text":"Hamburgers.  Really good ones.  Get the Hamburger with the blue cheese on it.  Soggy fries."}
{"text":"Although it's been a couple of years since I visited City Grill to eat dinner (which at the time was very enjoyable-I recall having a calamari salad), I frequently pass by it after a night out on the Southside and have discovered that it's one of the best places to get a late night snack. They offer pizza, either whole or by the slice, outside of the restaurant. It's quick and easy and if you're on the Southside to begin with, it will save you from having to drive somewhere to find a snack. It's only $1 for a piece and $6 for the whole pizza. Although toppings are limited (only cheese or pepperoni), it's always great. Not to mention that the staff is very friendly and will always let you wait inside on a cold night. A very good find!"}
{"text":"So, now that I can see this place is not actually a chain that had slipped under my radar, I can feel okay about writing about it. But I really thought it was, you see. It definitely has that kinda manufactured-chic, slick feel that the Milestone's across the street coats you in from the second you enter. This is okay by me. The menu is unassuming enough, offering one of my favourites: sweet potato fries, arriving alongside...a *triple* cheeseburger with a twist: the \"triple\" refers to the cheese, not the burger. Hells yeah.  This is pretty much the most valuable tidbit I can offer on the place. My cheese-loving friend and I (who had planned on having fondue at a place that had no room for us), were pretty pleased with this revelation. A decent burger, with a puddle of cheeses pouring over every one of its (non-existent) sides, and the option to add more (I'll admit, I was tempted by the mystery of what bleu cheese would do to it, and me).This, with the aforementioned and yummy sweet potato fries, washed down with some fruity, candy-coloured girl-drinks was enough to keep us happy, eating in the middle of the mall, in the middle of the holiday shopping season. That's gotta count for something."}
{"text":"After a hellish experience trying to find Sunday brunch that we wouldn't have to wait in line for, we decided to give City Grill a chance. And the day was saved.  Firstly, no line-up for Sunday brunch, then we had prompt, friendly service from all staff we came across, a nice, simple menu with delicious, healthy options, super fast food service and a cute little table where everyone gets to have the coveted \"bench seat\".  And the food was actually amazing. The brunch menu isn't huge, but it has something for everyone. I had French toast stuffed with peaches and raspberries, my boyfriend had a breakfast burrito. Both were served so fast we were in disbelief, and both were really, really good. I was eyeing other people's tables, and their soups, salads and sandwiches looked equally as tempting, but I wanted brunch too badly to consider anything else. Not only does everything on the menu look great, but they serve Mighty Leaf tea. Love the Mighty Leaf.  The place definitely looks like the kind of place that tourists will flock to before seeing something at Massey Hall or the Canon Theatre -- but I would recommend it for tourists and locals alike. Reasonably priced, excellent food, and friendly service. Couldn't ask for more.  Also I couldn't believe I had been suffering through the awful Mr. Greenjeans all these years. Next time I'll stay downstairs - City Grill has better, classic dishes for exactly the same prices."}
{"text":"I agree pretty much with the other reviewers that the burgers are fantastic.  I happened upon here today for lunch and can't believe in all the years I've been hangin in the s. side I never stopped prior.  The space itself is very nice it has exposed brick a nice bar with plenty of seating and multiple booths with dark wood and leather all around.  The only one complaint that I have about my initial impression is that it did  smell a little bit like my basement used to smell after a keg party in college when I first walked in.  I was greeted warmly by one of the servers \"Li Li\" I believe.  She was very friendly and we chatted for a while.  The bartender was \"Bear\".  He was a good typical burgh' bartender.  He served me a guiness quickly and knew the point spreads for all the college and pro games.  I ordered the \"ultimate burger\" which I ordered medium and they let me substitute a cup of french onion soup instead of getting fries.  Incidentally, they were very amenable to all kinds of sub stitutions as I witnessed while others ordered at the bar.  The soup was forgettable.  The broth itself was tasty enough and well seasoned, but the cheese wasn't burnt, it looked like they skipped putting it under the broiler.  It really doesn't matter the burger was the main feature.  Incidentally, I had no idea that this place was known for burgers, so it looks like I lucked out with the order.  The burger arrived quick enough it was a big 8 oz. burger overflowing with brie.  The burger was served on a perfectly toasted warm italian roll.  The burger itself was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  I'm pretty sure this meat is ground fresh daily and never frozen.  It very much reminded me of a Tessaros burger (and quite frankly maybe it was just as good, but I can't bring myself to say it).  The staff was so friendly I found myself staying for 3 guiness instead of a typical 1 beer lunch portion.  I will go again and stick to the burgers.  The rest of the menu was very reasonably priced, but again I think the burger is the star.  Incidentally, I was speaking with a friend in the restaurant business after lunch and the guy who originally opened tessaros is the current owner of city grill, so that accounts for much of the similiarity."}
