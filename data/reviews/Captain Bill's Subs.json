{"text":"Yum, very delicious... The atmosphere is awesome.. Cool place to eat, plenty to look at. I ordered a turkey bacon avocado on sourdough... Yummy!!! My kids ordered tuna salad and turkey bacon ham salad.. Very refreshing.."}
{"text":"Captain Bills.. aka \"sub shop\" to some.  (disclaimer- I grew up right down the street, and therefore am somewhat biased)  I love this place.  I know any food/sandwich snobby will likely berate this place.  To the uninitiated, warning sirens might be blaring in the back of your head from the moment you pull in to the parking lot.  From the sketchy run down strip malls, to the punk teenage kids smoking and joking on the patio, to the tasteless yet absolutely hilarious bumper stickers covering nearly every inch of the interior.   Manning the register will always be some pretty teenage girl with too tight shirt and impossibly short shorts, as the long time owner (Bill?) seems to have a not-well-hidden, creepy old perverted man vibe to him.  Now that I think about it, in the nearly 25 yrs that I have been going to this place, I dont think I have ever seen a male employee. Now to the food.  This is not a gourmet sandwich shop.  However the sandwiches are pretty good.  And as for value??  Seriously I dont think you can beat it.  As recently as 10 years ago you could get the Mini sub combo for 99cents which consisted of a 5 inch sub and a small drink, or you could pay $1.99 and double up to the 10 inch sub and medium drink.  Due to inflation, this may cost a whopping $2.60 now. Regarding the sub, its pretty good.  The bread is fresh and chewy, with shredded lettuce, tomatoes,onions and standard sub meat, but the key component is this italian dressing that is amazing.  Its secret ingredient must be crack because this stuff is addictive. Douse my sub in it and im happy.  Spill it on to my shoe and I would probably try to eat that as well.  And the drinks are made with the excellent crushed ice chips that i love.  This stuff is almost snow cone grade ice.  Yum Yum. As for the rest of the menu?  Yes there is more, but why bother.  I've never had a need or desire to order anything other than the Double mini combo.   So if you live or work in the neighborhood, I recommend stopping by and getting the best lunch you will ever find for less than $3.00."}
{"text":"This place was so fun to visit! It's like stepping back into the 80s! I loved it. Had the 8\" club. The price was very reasonable. Food was good. The Italian dressing is delish. Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"After moving to Phoenix, i've been looking for a great local sandwich shop and i finally found it.  Cheap sandwiches, lots of options, great personal vibe.  May not have all the new fangled options you can expect at scottsdale shops, but who cares.  These are great sandwiches at great prices!"}
{"text":"this is a small place offering quality subs at cheap prices. they pile on the ingredients. they have a sub and drink special for around $2.00! cool place with lots of goofy, off the wall, memorabilia. a neat place to sit and eat your food. it's not a chain like subway. definitely a place you can take a group and eat on the cheap side."}
{"text":"Food is good. Made fresh to order. Has a nice old feel to it, kind of feels like going back in time. Also, food is super cheap.   I came here at 7:30 at night, though, and they had five people working.  Seems odd for this late at night.   Comments about all female staff are correct, but that isn't relevant to their service.   Also some wall decorations are not family friendly.   Overall, will return."}
{"text":"Great sub shop. The sandwiches will not disappoint and the staff is fast and friendly. Places like this are the reason I like local joints so much better than corporate sameness. Unique and good. Wish I had tried it sooner."}
{"text":"Decent food at really good prices. This place is good for an office lunch run. It's nothing fancy but it hits the spot. The salads and sides are pretty good too. The bread always tastes fresh and the sandwich fillings are hearty and satisfying."}
{"text":"I go to Captain Bills all the time.Subs are inexpensive, great tasting! and the customer service is awesome! I give them two"}
{"text":"Little sandwich shop.. You can tell they haven't changed a lot in years. Staff consists of college girls and they even have a tip jar that asks for donations for their tuition. Food comes out fast and it's fine for the price. I'm only giving this place 2 stars bc they have many political propaganda stickers and signs.. I prefer business who don't take political stances.. I understand it's the business owner's right to put up those signs and also it's my choice as a consumer to not go back bc of that reason.. Plenty of places to get a $5 sandwich"}
{"text":"I had passed by this place several times so I finally decided to stop by as I was craving a salad and my partner a sub. We decided to switch it up for once and not go to subway.. so anyway ordered the bacon, ham and turkey salad and my partner the pastrami 10\" sub to go, i was excited to take it home and try it. I got home and took out the box in which the salad was in and it was a good size box I opened it and I was VERY disappointed, there in a corner of the box was a little lettuce with maybe 2 small pieces of bacon and shaved ham it was very plain..I should've went to burger king and got a better and bigger salad for the same $6 price and, as for the the sub it was very dry and plain my partner was very disappointed as well. Never going back again"}
{"text":"Everything about these subs are great: the meat, the toppings, and even the bread is delicious! Its worth a trip just to read the signs and bumper stickers."}
{"text":"A very local joint that looks like it's been serving sub's for years. Here is what I really like. The decor looks like it has not changed in 20 years. It has pictures of past customers all over the tables with funny things on the wall and ceiling. I tried the roast beef and it was good. Servers were nice young ladies. But only issue is the the chips were stale. About to expire in October and we are on September. All around if you can appreciate the old school decor you will enjoy the good priced food. Just don't get the chips unless they are fresh."}
{"text":"I grew up around this place and I just started going here in the last couple of years. I saw the light when I finally got the \"chicken deluxe\" with extra house dressings.. It is ridiculously good, and a flavor you can't get from Subway or Quizno's.. Their meatball sandwich is pretty darn good as well.  Whenever I am on this side of town and feel like a sub, I come to Captain Bills."}
{"text":"Bill's is a place I've been going to since I was a kid. I'm not a kid anymore and have recently come back to my home town of Phoenix after 9 years away. Obviously, I am extremely biased so take this review for what it's worth.  Captain Bill's is a great sub shop. The atmosphere is \"must see\" fun. Their sub's are first rate made to order and service is always friendly.  Now that I'm back home no other sub shop will get my business. Even as biased as I am, I believe a business must be something special to win my loyalty to the extent that Bill's has."}
{"text":"The subs are good but when you pay for a 10\" sub you are really only getting closer to 8\" so don't waste your money paying for a 10\"."}
{"text":"This review will seem very similar to the others.. like many, I've been going to Capt'n Bills since it  opened in the early 80s. I don't live on that side of town anymore yet I make at least one weekly pilgrimage..  First.. I get the 10\" vegi sub.. its simply the best vegi sub you can get anywhere.. and like other reviewers.. the Italian dressing is the special sauce'.   Secondly, the shave ice they use in their fountain drinks is the best. I don't like my kids drink any soda .. except at Captain Bills.. its good enough to break the rules.. :)  Lastly, the 'stuff' that  decorates the restaurant is not some corporate creation.. its paraphernalia that have been added, layer by layer, over the years by the employees themselves.. I love it all and so do my kids."}
{"text":"I had never visited this place before and was simply stunned by the beer joint bathroom decor. As another reviewer so aptly put it, \"To the uninitiated, warning sirens might be blaring in the back of your head from the moment you pull in to the parking lot, (with) the tasteless yet absolutely hilarious bumper stickers covering nearly every inch of the interior.\"   I went there on a friend's recommendation. What I don't get is why ANYONE would bring someone under 17 into this sub shop---ever. And yet  when I was there, there were plenty of kids. The bumper stickers are beyond tasteless---they're downright offensive! Here are some examples: \"Vaginatarian.\" \"Flies spread disease. Keep yours zipped.\" \"My kid had sex with your honor student.\" Call me a prude, but...seriously??  My jaw was on the floor the entire time I was waiting for my take-out order. I'm so glad I didn't happen to bring my 8th grader with me. The teenage girl who took my order was sporting more cleavage than a Hooter's server.   The place looks dirty, too.  But all that said, I have to admit the vegetarian sandwich I had was pretty darn tasty. My family enjoyed their sandwiches, too. So, all in all, if you're not easily offended like I am and you want really inexpensive but tasty subs available in a nice variety of sizes, you might want to take a chance on this place."}
{"text":"Family Favorite! I don't just mean my husband and children, I mean my 10 brothers and sisters and their families! This place has been around forever and has had great customer service for all those years. The house dressing is to die for. I get it on my sandwich every time! I love the decor. I love finding the pictures of ourselves and my brothers and sisters from 10-15 years ago."}
{"text":"Love Bill, Love the girls, Love the games, Love the prices, Love the food, Love the atmosphere. This is a fun, great place to stop, prices are awesome when you have pocket change budget, and even splurging you are around $10, so go enjoy!."}
{"text":"Get the vegetarian!!! It's the best veggie sub in town, otherwise you have to drive to the East Valley to Ned's or Steve's Krazy Subs but Bill's is still better :D"}
{"text":"Great subs at low prices... eat here!"}
{"text":"Car broke down on the NE comer of Peoria and 35th and I needed a place to get out of the heat.   I've seen Captain Bills building several times and decided to head on over and at least get a drink.  I ended up ordering the 10\" Italian.   I told the young lady behind the counter that it was my first time and asked for suggestions.  She was helpful and had several favorites.  So the Italian on sourdough was the best I've had in years! Bread was dense and chewey and held the delicious dressing inside.    I will definitely be back.   The price was right.   The service was good. The girls are constantly busy.   I never saw them picking their short shorts out of their crotches as review suggested. I didn't see any political bumper stickers that have been mentioned in other reviews either."}
{"text":"FYI if you smell something burning its your sandwich. A chicken deluxe and a captain cooler usually makes me happy EXCEPT when they burn the S out of it (see pic). Captian you better check your girls they are messing up my sandwich experience! Maybe I just came at the wrong time? I would usually give four stars but due to this tragic sandwich I just unwrapped they can't be saved."}
{"text":"Horrible! Can't get an order right. Dirty. And who the hell puts black olives and red onion on chicken parm? Steer clear. Bunch of idiots. Never going back. Chicken sucks anyway."}
{"text":"I come to Cap'n Bills a couple times a week. I think the quality is better than the big chain sub shops and the price is better. I usually get a 5\" sub for just over $3! I love this place! If you read the other reviews you know it's a unique place with bumper stickers, pictures and stuff everywhere. I like that I see something new every time I visit. I can also come in and order my \"usual\" now so it makes the experience that much better! Thank you Cap'n Bill and crew for the awesome food and service!!"}
{"text":"We started eating at Captain Bill's a couple years ago when we moved to the area. We prefer Bill's over Subway, the meat isnt salty and it has good flavor. The staff is always nice and friendly. One of my fave subs is the Bird&Beef, try it toasted with avocado."}
{"text":"They've been around forever. Food is good. Was better when they shaved the turkey instead of slicing it, but you can't have everything."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm definitely coming back. I ordered the turkey and cheese. They will pack your sandwich with plenty of meat! And the bread is yummy. Great decorating. Something you won't see at any other sub location. And they even have classic arcade games like Galaga and The Simpsons. You can't beat $4.85 for a turkey and cheese combo."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches I've ever had, been coming here since I was a kid. Definitely worth trying out. Awesome environment"}
{"text":"Food is excellent!  The place is kinda small, but there is no shortage of stuff to look at.  Just a cool place to eat.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm!!!!   Great sandwich! Had a TBA(turkey, bacon, avocado!) simple but plentiful! Freshly sliced turkey and veggies.they have so much to see in the restaurant and many selection of sandwiches to choose from. Not sure if i can choose other breads BUT I will ask next time!!! I also had some macaroni salad, never can get enough!"}
{"text":"I worked at Macy's at metro for a long time and a couple of friends and I decided try this place randomly one day not knowing anything about this place. Loved the quirkiness of the red and white striped roof. Was surprised by the inside which I swear everytime I go there's new bumper stickers I haven't seen yet. So without even eating yet I thought to myself I like this place. Then the food came out and I have to say its sooo much better then subway or any other sandwich shop ive ever eat at. Loved the food and loved that the drinks have crushed ice! Awesome quirky place."}
{"text":"Crazy Hole in the Wall Restaurant. So many old relics on the walls it's amazing. Fun place to try. Their house-made Italian dressing is to die for."}
{"text":"I always knew of Captain Bills because of growing up down the street. I never visited but referred my hubby who was curious about the food. He went a couple of days ago while we visited phoenix. He got a roastbeef sub. He stated the place is very nostalgic and is equipped with some old school games. The sandwich was heated per the suggestion of one of the girls that works there. He really liked it and would go again due to the price for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I could no longer resist this goofy, red and white striped, old-fashioned sandwich shop. When the craving for a good sandwich kicked in, I decided to give it a shot.  As soon as you enter, you are assaulted visually with orange-red (well, I think that's what they are, underneath) walls, jam-packed with old signs, toys, and bumper stickers. Mind you, this is in a very small space. The tables are the old school laminate booths, decorated with some very 80's photos of teens. Lots of big hair!  Trying to be somewhat calorie conscious, we ordered two \"mini\" 5\" subs and some drinks. Each also came with a rather sweet potato salad or something similar.   My chicken sub was pretty dry and boring, and served on an equally dry and flavorless white roll. The only flavor it had was the occasional pocket of black pepper.  All in all, the food got a big *meh*. The decor was cool, but not worth eating the food. Oh, and if you decide to go, bring cash, rather than deal with their bizarre ATM system."}
{"text":"The place is okay, the staff is alright. The subs are pretty good, but the reason I'm giving it only two stars isn't just the fact that it looks like the inside of an old man's garage, but the political stickers. Any business that has any sense knows not to take political sides, lest they alienate customers. The fact that Bill doesn't care and puts them up anyway says a lot about what he thinks of his customers."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop. The subs were very good had a little too much mustard but very good and fresh  Would defiantly be back again  Price was good for all that we order would recommend"}
{"text":"This place is amazing I forgot about it for some time so we took a dive and found it again. Then best subs ever well here in Phoenix anyway.  Thx dan"}
{"text":"Ahh Captain Bill's Sub Factory.  If you rep the metrocenter area as I have since my birth in 73 then you no doubt have eaten at Captain Bill's.  I've been eating subs there for nearly 25 years.  This place is a true phoenix landmark.  Simply put, I love this place.  I love everything about it.  Where else can you roll in with 3 bucks and roll out full?  I used to ride my skateboard up there in the mid eighties and take the trash out for the many hot chicks both from cortez and moon valley that worked there at the time and they would feed me free subs.  Then I would play 720 until they kicked me out.  Nothing beats a Captain Bills Italian sub.  Nothing.  I continued to go there over the years, I got married, I had kids and I took them there.  As I sat there this afternoon with my 16 year old son feeling sentimental as the faces of those I knew so long ago stared back up at me from the tables.  I vowed to never eat a sub anywhere ever again but at good ole Captain Bill's.  As we left my son commented that the chicks were hot.  \"They always were\" I said, \"they always were.\"  Thanks Bill."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of this restaurants all the little trinkets around! I got he soup, it was okay, ill get a sandwich next time. Sandwiches were cheap! I am not sure they have a bathroom. The place def has history, but the food I got tasted a little old and I got hot water no ice, pretty lame. I like that its little!"}
{"text":"I'm actually taking off 1 star for all the anti-Obama stickers they had by the register. Sadly I do realize we have to put up with the uneducated from time to time but that was a bit much.   Ok, on to the food. This was the first time I have been to Capt Bills and did not have any idea of what to expect. I did check out the reviews on Yelp and they looked pretty good. I have driving by this place for years  and never stopped in so I figured why not.     When I first walked in I liked the look of the place. Lots of wood and it felt like an old school joint. I walked up to order and was greeted by a rather attractive young lady and thats always a good way to start things. I ordered the 10 inch Italian and 2 10 inch pastrami subs. Price was not to bad overall. The Italian sub is dirt damn cheap for what you get. I did order to go so I picked it up and went on home to try out this new (to me) place.     I took a bite of the Italian first and was amazed at how good it was. Lots of flavor with a nice fresh taste. Excellent bread with good cheese. This is a winner in my book. I will be back for the Italian.      I then reached over and took a bite of the pastrami and again was shocked at how good it was. This is not the type of pastrami you find at places like Chompies but a bit more like lunch meat. It was however very good with no gristle at all. Great flavor and very good cheese. Another winner for me. I am now starting to think about trying more and more of what Capt Bills has to offer.      All in all Capt Bills gets high marks for the food but a big negative for the political B.S. on the walls. I will be back for the food but I will never start a chat about politics in this place."}
{"text":"I actually really love the food here. Prices are very good for what you get. The only thing is the place looks like a hoarder house. It hasn't changed since in the 80's except got more bumper stickers. When you look at this place it really makes you want to go somewhere else. I really hope the owner realizes soon what a dump and out-dated place it is and does something cause I would be sad if it were to close."}
{"text":"Can't say it's great but I can't say it's bad.  It's just your neighborhood cheap eats place. They have been putting the meat between the buns since 1981.  Couple bucks and you get a decent sandwich on good bread with fresh toppings. Kind of nice to run into Bill himself when you stop by. I've been going here for over 30 years and it just gets better and edgy with time. The staff is a teenage boys wet dream and the meal fits their minimum wage budget.  It's a no frills kind of place but worth stopping by...grab a double with your choice a dressing and toppings, then take a minute to read the culmination of 30 years of artwork, swag, bumper stickers and cool stuff."}
{"text":"Nice little sandwich shop; good food and lots of choices.  The hot beef and Italian beef both worth checking out.  Fun atmosphere.  The only drawback is not very much inside seating.  But they do have seating outside to make up for it."}
{"text":"Yum Yum! Great little joint just north of Peoria on 35th Ave. Great bumper stickers and signs everywhere and cute girls making sandwiches..;-)"}
{"text":"I have been going to Captain Bill's since I could drive, so over 15 years. When I lived in the area I would make excuses to go over there as much as possible. Let's see why it has all the right ingredients for an awesome sandwich shop.  Great bread, delicious meats, fresh vegetables. All the essentials are present and this place puts them altogether in the right order. I have had over a dozen types of sandwiches and they are all outstanding. In fact, I would just have to describe the sandwiches I only ate once or twice as less outstanding, but not less than outstanding. That barely made sense but I think you get what I am saying. My last trip they either made up a new sandwich or I just missed it over the last decade. Buffalo chicken sandwich. Yes, you just drooled a little. It tasted as I had suspected, amazing, but I will have to warn you that it had a little more heat than I anticipated. I am okay with it but somebody else might not like it a little more on the spicy side. So I recommend it for certain. What is strange is that I usually order the BLT. It is so basic and I can make those at home but for some reason Captain Bill's just makes a damn good BLT.  Time for a little truth out of me. Part of the appeal of Captain Bill's was the sandwich girls. It seems as though the Captain didn't hire unattractive help. The attractive help hasn't changed but what has changed is my age so now that I am married it is just a little creepy of me to notice these things. Or I am just a guy. Either way the younger crowd will enjoy the staffing scenery. Don't tell my wife I just said that...  Great sandwiches and the admittedly lovely and capable staff come together in a great sandwich shop with great prices. They have stood the test of time and if you are within a 5 mile radius of this place and you still go to a Subway, you should question why you are even on a site like Yelp and actually care about your food. Captain Bill's is also a very entertaining place to eat. Once you get there, you will understand what I mean."}
{"text":"absolute hole in the wall but by far the most tasty subs around.  Forget subway!  You drive up to this tent-like circus building and you can't prepare for the interior decor :)  You find something new to read every time you're there!!  They have a good variety of hot & cold subs and very tasty!! I would definitely recommend for a fast lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This place has been around forever.  So long in fact that I still recognize some of the 80's and 90's faces in the photos that make up the tabletops.  Of course, the owner always stocks the counter with fresh faces from the surrounding high schools.  Food is good, beats the pants off of Subway.  Bread is made fresh, and veggies are always fresh.  I love the use of Italian dressing on the house special subs.  Make sure to get a Capin' Cooler and take advantage of the inexpensive sub-drink special.  When I first started visiting Captain Bills at age 10, there were so many bumper stickers on the walls that I didn't understand.  I would wonder what my Dad was laughing at.  As my sense of humor developed through puberty, I certainly appreciated a great many more.  The decor of Captain Bills was definitely a major influence on my sense of humor.  Today, my 10 year old asks me what's so funny about some of the bumper stickers when we visit... ah, innocence.  Classic joint, good food, great prices, and a delightful decor."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches at cheap prices. Love it! Go here now. Locally owned, been open for 3 decades and for good reason"}
{"text":"Good subs at a good price.  But if it's busy you will need to get it to go, because there is not a lot of seating.  But I like it, definitely would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Love this historic Peoria landmark! Best subs in town! Always a great place to hang out, with amazing employees."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I was a little kid. I lived right down the street and came almost every day during the summer then drove from my high school during lunch. The original Italian sub is my go to sandwich but the Bbq beef is awesome. I can't get enough of the Italian dressing, it's great on just about anything. No matter how long it's been, when I come back I will never be disappointed. Thanks Capt Bills for being apart of my childhood and my kids as well."}
{"text":"I want to rate this place higher but I just can't bring myself to do it with the staff there.  First the good:  This is a fun sandwich shop with plenty of interesting things to look at on the walls while you're waiting for your food.  The sandwiches are very good and represent excellent value for your money.  I had a brisket sandwich on one of my visits that was outstanding.  I also like the fact that it's a local small business and as a result I'll always make an effort to go here as opposed to Subway or something like that.  The bad:  The staff is very friendly but they just don't have their act together.  I have been here three times in the last six months and every time something has been screwed up.  The first time I waited 15 extra minutes because they forgot to make a portion of my order.  Another time I got home and my sandwich was missing three of the toppings I had asked for.  The last time a few days ago I ordered a French Dip and got home before I realized they didn't give me the au jus.  I'll probably be back at some point because the sandwiches are good, but I learned my lesson and will be thoroughly checking my order before leaving the building in the future."}
{"text":"Normally this is a great place to grab an inexpensive lunch quickly, but gotta say that the cashier today was awful. Rude, indifferent, just a general drag to be around. If this is the current level of employee they are hiring, I'm not coming back. Makes me sad as I've been a customer since the late 80's."}
{"text":"While on the hunt for something for the family to quickly eat at a nearby Basketball Tournament , we decide to give ole Bill a try.   Love the  kitschy vibe of this place.Tons of  funny- to obnoxious stickers and signs plaster the place.   For a minute I thought it was Two Hippies Sub shoppe.  But this little hole in the wall does a soild business slinging out the standard american sub.  While nothing to flavorful was ordered by my Troupe, I am willing to go back and find the hidden gems that must be in  this dive.     Word to the Wise bring cash or be prepared to pay a dollar fee for a debit /credit card... really?"}
{"text":"The food was ok, I had a French dip 10\". The staff was nice. Over all I would say this is definitely a quick lunch place and that's about it."}
{"text":"I live in the East Valley and this is my favorite place for a sub sandwich in the valley. I eat here anytime I can make it out to this side of town."}
{"text":"Updating for the vegan perspective: I asked the staff & owner if their bread contained any animal products. He had no idea, but he did try to call his bread supplier (Capistrano's bakery) to find out for me. Unfortunately, they couldn't tell him at the time, so I asked him for the phone number (480-968-0468).  I followed up with a phone call to the bakery another day and they informed me that they use whey (an animal protein) in all of their wheat & white breads. Their sourdough bread has no animal ingredients, so vegans eating a sandwich here should opt for the sourdough bread.  Recommendation to Capt-N Bill: Add a vegan sub option to your menu."}
{"text":"Its been here FOREVER - one reason why it is a local favorite. Come in and check it out!"}
{"text":"The last time I ate here was in the 80's and it was great I was there today and it's still great love the service I will be going there more often"}
{"text":"Can't ever get a taste of this place, literally. As if yet, every time my husband and I visit Captain Bill's they have the doors locked 15-40 minutes before the actual closing time. Very unreliable business."}
{"text":"Work is close to CB's.. Ive driven by this place for yours and have never stopped by. Okay this place is old school seriously! It's like you have walked into some time space vacuum where neither exist. Kitschy, tacky, creepy all describe this place well. What they do have are killer sourdough rolls that are chewy and bagel like stacked with plenty of meat too! This place is an awesome cheap eats lunch if Ive ever had one! I recommend the 17\" Italian Combo so fresh tasting. you'll love it here.. show up early as the lines can get long!"}
{"text":"Great prices...awesome food. Captain Bills is an establishment and have been doing business right since day one. Love to give them my business and love their food. Keep us the good work and great place for lunch."}
{"text":"We ordered the krab salad and chicken salad subs. They were good, but sparse on the protein and overkill on the lettuce.  I'd rather pay a dollar extra for more chicken or krab salad on my sandwich."}
{"text":"Tried the New York Beef, it was thin sliced roast beef dipped in aus ju and had peppers and onions. It was ok, nothing special. The bread was really good."}
{"text":"We went to Captain Bill's Submarine for lunch last week after a recommendation for one of Phoenix's finest, law enforcement officers.  This place is truly unique and a one of kind and I look forward to my next visit.  The owner of this place has a sense of humor, which is displayed through all of the bumper stickers everywhere, things hanging from the ceiling and on their old booths from the seventies with pics of their customers and friends everywhere.  It is an \"eye-spy\" fun place to have lunch!  This place is REALLY CHEAP and the food is A~OK.  I had a hot pastrami sub.  The pastrami was OK, not bad but OK.  The bread was a little crispy on the outside and fresh'n chewy on the inside.  The portion of hot pastrami was very good and it had shaved lettuce, tomato, and onion on it as well. I opted for the smaller, 8 inch sub with chips and a drink all for less than $7!!  WOW! The service is quick and friendly.  They have all kinds of sub's both hot and cold to choose from at 5\", 8\" and 10 inches. They offer soups and salads and have loads of people calling in orders for take out.  They also have an Italian sub that is 10\", 14\" or 17\"...  Maybe next time, Captain Bill!!"}
{"text":"Everyone needs to eat here. The NYB with everything amazing.. make sure you get the Italian dressing.. Outstanding.. you all did great.. GO HERE.."}
{"text":"Great Subs for a great price! I had the 8\" Italian with the works! Great decor! Arcades for the kids! Wife got the turkey sub and enjoyed it. A must if you are in the area. No restroom working  when we came so go before you stop in lol!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Great food at a good price.  I hope this place stays open for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Nope, not going back. Incompetent and argumentative employees plus dirty tables and dusty things hanging from the ceiling equals a huge turn-off. Meat portions were small at best! But there was plenty if not too much lettuce on my husband's Club sandwich! No public restroom even for customers? How am I supposed to wash my hands before eating? At this restaurant the customer is never right! Stay away and spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The girls are awesome. The brownie is so rich. I stick to the turkey bacon avocado and it is fire!  This is my weekly lunch spot"}
{"text":"First time here! I stepped back into the 1980's. The food tasted like you were eating back in the day something your mother would make. The staff is super friendly! The decor really stands out and is pretty cool and that they have everything you would remember. Sorry 90's babies you wouldn't remember because you weren't born yet."}
{"text":"Great subs at a great price I have been going here since I was little and have great memories of this place. The food is amazing and the girls are really nice but I think bill might be a little creepy since he has minors dressed provocatively serving subs. Regardless that doesn't change my opinion. I get the same sandwich every time, roast beef and cheese sauce with mayo and tomatoes and it is the best thing ever. I highly recommend it, you will not be disappointed. Also it's not actually cheese sauce it's like real melted cheese."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever. I always like going here cause the collection of miscellaneous stuff he has inside hanging on the walls and celling are always great to look at. My favorite is the Ronald McDonald hanging from the celling by a noose. lol you just have to go here to see it cause every time you go you will see something new that you did not see the last time. On to the food, they have a good cheap sandwich here. They have many sandwiches on the menu and they good prices. I think they are one of the cheapest places in town for sandwiches. They have a special for a 7in ham and cheese with a small soda for $3. This place gets very busy at lunch and seating is limited. Fun place to go and it doesn't hurt the wallet."}
{"text":"I used to come here when I was growing up. I like to support local business so now that I've moved back to the area I thought it would be fun to take my family. Wrong. While the food hasn't changed and is fine, the atmosphere isn't. Negative political bumper stickers made it instantly uncomfortable. We almost left before we even ordered. While many of my high school classmates faces are still on the tables and walls, the place didn't feel good to be in. We ate quickly outside and left. Won't be back. The sad thing is it has nothing to do with the food."}
{"text":"First time coming here and we lived it!!! I had the barbeque beef brisket and lemonade."}
{"text":"I love the environment. You can sit in here for an hour and look at stuff on the walls. oh yeah. Did I mention the food is good too. . .   I have to address the staff issue. He hires nothing but high school or young college tooth picks who don't have a lot of customer service skills. But like I said just like all the memorabilia and photos on the walls and tables it's fun to look at."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in years. Had dinner here today. Wow. I remember it was good, but not this good. Maybe it's because I'm no longer a highschool kid ordering the cheapest thing available."}
{"text":"We ordered two pastrami subs for pick up today at 12pm. Asked for toasted buns, lettuce, onions, tomatoes and mustard/mayonnaise on the side. We received two sorry looking subs, not toasted with cold meat. There wasn't enough meat in both subs to make one sub let alone two! Very disappointed! :-("}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is great. Lots of fun. Always clean. Service is excellent. All of the girls that work here are nice and helpful. My order is always right, very quick to prepare your meal. Maccaroni salad is a prefered side. The sub sandwiches are good. I always get extra meat. The bread is soft and always fresh. The prices are very cheap, especially for lunch meals. I recommend this place to everyone. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to eat great subs.  Wonderful fun place to eat. There is tons to look at all around. Tons of bumper stickers and the subs are good."}
{"text":"Just ordered through Grubhub.  The price was good, but even for that, the quality was not.  A large sub is 10\".  But it is 2\" wide, and comes on a large hotdog bun if ordered on white.  The toppings that I did receive were scarce, and I never received the cucumbers on either of my 2 sandwiches.  The H.T.S. sub had the tiniest amount of mayo and mustard on it and was dry.  I also did not receive either of the 2 sides that I ordered.  Maybe it would be better if I actually went there, but I definitely won't be ordering delivery again."}
{"text":"Oh Captain Bill's, where do I begin? I'll start with the positive. The subs are cheap, fast, and good quality. Whenever I want a fast and easy French dip sandwich I come here.  Now for the not-so-positive. All of the staff besides the older male owner (that I've seen) is made up of young girls under 20 or so whose work \"uniform\" is a tank top and booty shorts which I guess some patrons might find appealing. The youngest I've seen working there had to be 15 with braces and poor math skills (she undercharged me by $8). The fact that the staff is mostly underage girls with an older male owner is a little creepy. Also, there are \"politically incorrect\" stickers everywhere mocking Obama and so forth. Edgy. After ordering I always feel conflicted about supporting a business with shady practices. But, I do still buy their food every once in a while."}
{"text":"What a strange, and fantastic place to do lunch. The eclectic decor will have you entertained for as long as you stay. I had the BBQ Brisket 8\". It was tasty... If you go let me know, I'll meet you there."}
{"text":"I think I have found the secret power source that  fuels the awesomeness that is Captain Bill's.    Firstly this place has more bumper stickers  than a VW microbus convention, secondly  the paint scheme could be a landing light for the White Stripes  but I digress  let's get back to the power.    On the SF2 game a sticker proclaims.    \"your honor student  never gets laid\"  To the left of the register.   \"My kid has sex with your honor student.\"   This sets up a reality inversion  field which  prevents much electronic equipment from working that's why they don't take credit cards (duh!)   but also seems to power the time bubble back to a prior decade. I'm really impressed and annoyed that I hadn't tried them out prior.   The two staff on today were  described , e.g not lacking in the pulchritude department,from the other  reviews  but I didn't notice a lack of CS service, nor would I expect it based on looks so wanted to kick that one out the door.     We had a cup just collapse and  a refill / mop appeared  within seconds.     Oh the food, yeah  the food is not likely to be the best sandwich you have ever tasted but  you may forget that while eating it.   Smacks the chains  silly ( all  I ask really) and offers well priced sodas,   ice chips rather than cubes and fresh main ingredients.   As unpretentious as the bumper stickers  that adorn the walls. A statement of single intent.  Feed me , fresh, cheap now:)"}
{"text":"Went to Captain Bills today for the first time since about 1995.  I had to get my bearings back, got the Italian combo, it seemed EXACTLY the same!  (In a good way) I wish this establishment and employees the best going forward.  Good to know I can come back to something that reminds me of being a kid."}
{"text":"Capt. bills has always been my favorite place to eat :) now me and my husband enjoy it, our kids enjoy it, And it still has the fun raunchy humor that we can still giggle about like were in high school ;D"}
{"text":"Meatball sub horrible,little rocks of meat? Never again"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a classic. I only wish I had gone there more growing up in the area.  If I wanted to, I could catch up now though, because nothing has changed about this place!  Cheap, tasty grub.  Three video games at the front.  Bumper stickers and photos all over the place, and of course, the young high school (or recent graduate) girls working there.  I think the only difference from the ol' days is that they have some sort of ATM type system.  I tried something new this time, going with the BBQ Brisket sandwich with cheese.  While the cheese wasn't quite melted all the way, I definitely enjoyed the sandwich.  The beef was flavorful and the bread seemed quite fresh.  I washed it down with a classic, the Cap'n Cooler.    I also liked that the food was brought to the table, that was a nice touch.  If only they could make the parking lot a little more efficient...  Four stars for the good grub and solid value."}
{"text":"Been going to captain bills for a very long time! It's a classic place in the Phoneix area. A must go! Try the bbq chx sub!"}
{"text":"I remember many years ago how much I loved going to Captain Bills.  My mom found this place and I loved the stickers and the subs were good.  Plus i was cheap enough that my mom could afford it. I decided to bring my brother who lives out of town here even though i hadn't been in awhile, and I brought my three year old daughter. A mistake I will not make again.  First off, there was no sourdough. Which there definitely used to be.  My sandwich was pretty bland, it tasted like bread and thats about it. Plain white bread. Yum! Glad I drove out of my way for it.  Then, the most awesome part. My kid needed to use the bathroom, but oh wait....They don't have one that their customers can use. i was instructed to go ask the Mexican place across the street. Thats what I want to do! Pick up my three year old and drag her across the parking lot and pray that we make it in time. I won't be coming back. The once funny stickers it seems are only updated with political crap instead of general humor, the once great subs are bland, their service varies depending on which high school student you end up getting but most of the ones I've encountered during the times I've gone had attitudes that I chose to ignore because it was a fun, unique place that had good subs, and finally....to end this huge run on sentence there isn't even a bathroom to use. Just that, in itself is enough where I'd question going back but the whole experience including the food is just not worth making the trip there any longer. Stickers and history can only take you so far."}
{"text":"I think I just found the best sub shop in town.    Captain Bill's has been around forever.  I even remember this place as a kid, though I never went here.  No idea why.    The place is a very small subshop that houses about six or so small tables and covered wall to wall are pictures of people who have been there from way back in the early 80s.  I recognized many people from the pics and it was a pretty cool idea.  I ordered myself a salami, pepperoni and cheese sub (baked) along with some italian dressing.  I thought \"Well I'll get an 8\" because the full is just too big.\"  I destroyed that thing in a matter of a few minutes.  I could have easily done a 10\" sub.  The bread was so soft and crunchy in just the right toasted way.  The meat and veggies inside were just perfect and the italian dressing made it a sweet finish.  I can't wait to go back!  This place is the best!"}
{"text":"This is certainly a unique sub shop! But good food and good prices! I had an 8\" club, chips, and drink for just over $6. The bread was yummy! My friend's veggie sandwich looked pretty good too.  I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite sub sandwich.  Bread was stale, too much dressing making it wet and Soggy. The service was very quick but I probably won't eat there again."}
{"text":"Captain Bill's is an homage to the bygone era of one-off sub shops and local flavor joints that crust their interiors with pictures, ornaments, plaques and all kinds of pop-culture tchotchke .  Located at the north east corner area of Peoria and 35th, Captain Bill's headlines a tiny strip mall with its crowded sit down area and small outside table patio.   The first thing you notice after the inner decor is the low prices. A mini sub and chips and drink are just $5. And it's big enough for a nice lunch. You can go 10, 14 and 17 inch on the subs as well. I had a 14 inch sub and meal for just $8. Really pretty great deal.  I got an Italian sub which was made with 4 meats and a nice soft tube of Italian bread. The sandwich wasn't the best ever, but still tasty. This shop is about the meal package so definitely recommend the meal if you go.   It's clear that locals favor the shop as it was well trafficked during my late lunch visit.  Overall, the price and novelty of the unique shop are worthy of 5 stars, but the generally above average taste of the sub doesn't warrant top billing. Still , Captain Bill's garners my 4 stars for being the long standing local legend of subs that it is."}
{"text":"Go for the sandwiches, stay for the decorations! It's a bizarre carnival of bumper stickers, photos, comics and jokes from floor to ceiling. Every time, I see something new. The sandwiches are better quality, better priced and better sizes than the franchise place with the 11\" foot long ;) It's always fast, always delicious and has a killer lunch special. A must-go."}
{"text":"I love Capt'n Bills! I've been coming here since I was in high school and the food has been consistent! 10years and counting! Prices are more than fair especially for the amount of food you get.  I never shy away from my turkey provolone with all the veggies. Don't forget the house dressing! Best addition to your cold sub without a doubt. And if you're in the mood for a dessert don't skimp, get the brownie.  The girls are great, quick and friendly. If you see Bill he's pretty cool too since he's been running the joint for a few decades.   Don't be turned away by the outside of the building or the inside...it's been around for sometime, you'll be able to tell by all the tables-they have photos of the previous years (and I mean years) customers that used to frequent Bills.   Capt'n Bills is the best sub shop I've ever been to and will continue to go when I'm craving a sandwich."}
{"text":"While so many good words come to place when I think of Captain Bills Subs... the one that pretty much wholly sums it up is \"RAD\" :) the décor is rad, the chicks that work there are rad, the old video games to play are rad, the prices are rad and the Italian dressing and everything else on the menu food is super rad,...yup RAD."}
{"text":"To call this place a pop-culture \"museum\" is a pretty big stretch. What it is, is a sub-shop that feels like the business that time forgot. I love kitschy, I love retro,... but for some reason, this one just didn't do it for me.  I'm not sure if it was the plethora of rude and uninterested staff girls who were too busy constantly picking their short-shorts out of their crotches (seriously, how hard is it to wear clothes that you don't have to pick out of your ass while making food you're serving to the public??) while running in and out of the back office, or it if was the brown paneling and hard orange chairs that matched the dirty orange floors and trash littered ancient table tops, or if it was the mediocre food - which all I kept thinking while eating it was, \"God I hope I don't get sick\". It made me feel like the bumper sticker decor of the early eighties was just a distraction to make you forget everything else that was unpalatable.   This feels like a place with an absentee owner who seems to be sucking out every dime of profit without adding a red cent more back into it than absolutely necessary. A shame really, because with a solid deep cleaning, an overhaul of the staff, some minor updating (and I mean minor - not asking for the world to change here), and a slight upgrade in quality of ingredients, they could easily stop being famous for being some of the cheapest subs around, and actually retain customers for being one of the best sub shops around. I was honestly surprised by the volume of business they were getting on a Sunday afternoon.  Sadly, what used to be witty, funny, and trendy now just feels neglected and bitter, like the prom queen that got knocked up & lives down the road in the trailer park with her 3 kids and a drunk mechanic for a husband. As it is, it continues to be \"affordable\" because they can't realistically raise their prices to competitive market value; with everything I've listed it would be an insult for them to charge anything more. It'll do in a desperate pinch, but I honestly wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have fond memories of the place from 20+ years ago."}
{"text":"Was told to try this joint out. I'm a Caprioti's man and no sandwich can stand up against them, but I gave this joint a try. I love the inside of this place all the funny bumper stickers and decor. The chicks that work there are smoking hot, bonus.   I ordered the Italian, asked for everything on it, and I wanted Oil, Vinegar, and oregano. Was told they don't put Oil,vinegar on they samiches and Italian dressing is as close as they can get. Odd I mean Subway even has oil and vinegar. Samich was middle of the road. I would go back for sure"}
{"text":"I just got back from lunch here, and it was awesome!  I am always on the hunt for the perfect sandwich and lunchtime spot.    This place is quaint and decorated in a very eccentric way, which just adds to the charm.    I ordered the Italian sub with macaroni salad, a brownie, and a cherry coke.  Cherry coke is not on the menu, but when I asked the owner told me he would make me one on a special order.  And who says customer service is dead?  It's alive and well here!  The sandwich was excellent, the best part being their Italian sauce.  The brownie...it was cold, fudgy, and amazing.  I got a 5\" sub, macaroni salad, coke, and a brownie for $5.07 - these prices are incredible!  What a value!  I will definitely be back here, probably on a weekly basis, because it is getting added to the new lunchtime rotation."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place out since I had heard good things from friends.  The BLT I had was good tasting but my biggest issue was \"where's the meat?\"  The Bacon barely made enough to be two strips when pulled together. Very disappointed. A bread sandwich with lettuce, tomato and just a sprinkling of bacon. I will say the service was great, very friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I have been eating here for (holy cow) 20 years.  There used to be 2 other locations but this is the only one left.  Just a normal sub shop but the people are friendly and the menu is cheap.  Took the whole family, wife and 2 kids, here for lunch and it was only like 15 bucks.  Can't beat that in this economy.  The inside is covered in bumperstickers and the tables have 1980's high school pictures lacquered into the table so it keeps the kids entertained."}
{"text":"Having worked here I'm going to be completely biased. Kind of. By far one of the best sub places in the area. You get tasty food and extremely attractive high school/college girls feeding you. You know if you like that then you'll like it here. Some days the girls are rude and the sandwiches sloppy but trust me you'll just keep on coming back!!! Bumper stickers everywhere that piss most democrats off. Some republicans too lol. The bathroom sucks and depending on the girl's day/mood it's for employees only haha.   This place is a gem and I'd defend it in a heartbeat. Not only because the food is good but because this place HAS a soul. You can just feel it when you walk in and I mean that for a majority of the customers and the girls.   As far as Bill.. he's gone now... forever will he hold a special place in our hearts and if it weren't for him you wouldn't have this little shit hole. We love you. Thank you for some of the best memories of my life, the girls lives and the customers. May you rest in peace."}
{"text":"My last review was a long time ago and it was about the bread so I decided to try them again today.  Bread...100% better.  Tuna they put between the bread...awful.  Looked brown, low quality and had the sweetness of Miracle Whip not Mayo.  It was probably mayo but with too much sweet pickle mixed in.  I was so disappointed...I didn't complain...I just brought it home and gave it to my dogs.  If I ever go back...it will have to be for cold cuts which stand on their own merit.  Sorry I want local businesses to florish. Hope owner checks it out."}
{"text":"Small location, interesting decorations (some with funny remarks) and the food is a good deal. I got a turkey & roast beef sub with the cheddar & broccoli as their soup of the day. The bread was fresh & made the sub great! All other ingredients were fresh as well. The soup was a great addition as well. Will be back, great spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"Tried the BBQ sandwich a few days ago, pretty good. Soup is still delicious. You can't beat these prices."}
{"text":"Friends took me and my boyfriend here today and I must say I'm a huge fan! We had the mini Italian subs. So great! 4 mini subs and 2 large drinks for $7 ! Amazing. The sandwiches were absolutely delicious, fresh and filling and the decor kept us entertained our entire meal. Definitely gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"Captain Bill's is a long standing INSTITUTION. Soooo glad it still STANDS!    I remember students from the local high schools nearby (Cortez, Moon Valley, Apollo etc.) would literally RACE to get there first to avoid the wait- though even if you were out the door, the wait wasn't long. You'd just fill out your order on a notepad on top of the cigarette machine with a golf pencil.   To the food;  a 'single' or a 'double' is all you need (it's the basic or standard cold-cut house sandwich) and I'm guessing over 50% of their sales.  It tastes good, even if it's poorly made that day because it's SOOO cheap! In fact, it was cheaper than a high school cafeteria lunch. And of course you can't get out of there NOW for $2- (like 25 years ago) you still can get a great sandwich and beverage for a few bucks.   If the bread is hard or crusty, you can bet your entire experience will be bad.  That means the crew working (in short shorts) that day isn't following protocol- e.g. Leaving buns exposed. They'll go too easy on the dressing, and forget you asked for extra mayo or paid to add bacon. This WILL HAPPEN 1 out of 4 visits...but then again, I've heard Captain Bill is like the soup Nazi, so the staff may have attitude.     It's the PERFECT light meal, snack, or summertime poolside pleasure....    Love it WITH all it's imperfections!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for 20 years, and it never disappoints! One of the best hole in the walls in Phoenix."}
{"text":"5\" subs are inexpensive and filling. I had a very tasty French Dip hot sub. The meat was tender and flavorful, the roll was fresh and crusty, and the au jus was the perfect companion for dunking. The atmosphere kept me very entertained while I ate. Excited to try more subs!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place and I think I may have eaten there as a kid, but I'm not sure. I went in today to check it out since the reviews tend to be positive and I was told it's the best sub in town. I will say it's pretty inexpensive as far as subs go, but the food was just so-so. Nothing wrong with what was on the sub but the bread tasted very much like something you'd get in the bread section of a grocery store. I might hit it up again if I'm in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip for it."}
{"text":"a wide variety of sandwiches to choose from, hot or cold, the staff consists of pretty girls that work together efficiently to provide quick service and although there may be a line at the register, i promise, the wait is never long.try the New York beef n cheese.its my favorite and never disappoints.The prices are awesome.Cheapest prices around town for a HOT sub. The place has been there for decades seems like, so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"This is truly amazing place. I used to come here over 20 years ago with my parents as a child. Now as an adult I can honestly see why we came here every weekend. The food is the best in the valley. The decorations are fun, the prices are cheap. And the staff are so beautiful. It's a fun, cheap, and incredibly tasty. I highly recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Got the turkey bacon and avocado on white was Soo bomb was not disappoint everything I had been wanting!! Brownies were eh but overall was a nice quick bite to eat"}
{"text":"This is a nice sub shop. It's on the East side of 35th Ave, just next to Rolandos. Good food, decent prices. I've got to say the right-wing stickers are kind of stupid, and are probably going to piss off a few potential customers. I say this as a middle of the road, conservative leaning type. I mean, what's the Republican party done for Arizona except turn it into the laughing stock of the country? Anyway, the hours are 10 or 11am to 9 on weekdays."}
{"text":"I love this place -- been going here for more than 15 years. The kitschy decor and sense that you've time-warped back to 1983 only add to the appeal. It's a sandwich shop, for heaven's sake, not a gourmet restaurant. Anyway, if your company sucks, at least you can laugh at the bumper stickers and goofy photos of circa-1980s teens."}
{"text":"The Yelpers helped me out again. There were enough good reviews for me to give Captain Bill's a try. It's near my house and I have passed by it many times but never tried it. The inside is small but uniquely decorated. I didn't eat there, took it home.  Good prices - $6.93 for 10\" vegetarian sub, small tea, chips. Sub tasted good. Had 4 cheeses, all the veggies & avacado.   Will definitely have their food again but will order take out."}
{"text":"I love these sandwiches. Bummed the service gets worse and worse EVERYTIME I come it. It's 12pm on a Saturday. Pretty empty in here and the girl taking are order actually sighs like we're bothering her. Probably one of the rudest experiences when eating. I mean I'll come back because the sandwiches to me are 5 stars.. But Bill needs to get some new friendly energetic girls again."}
{"text":"Great place to get a good sandwich,  I got the Roast beef with horseradish. Really good!!!!"}
{"text":"I try to add a new place to my dining experience when I'm house sitting in the neighborhood. After a couple of visits to Captain Bill's, I can't say I'm overly impressed. The bread has always been on the hard side and the fillings are hit or miss. With the cold cuts, everything seems fine. But the buffalo chicken was dry and awful. Really only worth 2 stars, but I find their quirky bumper stickers and the '80s pictures to be amusing so I bumped it up."}
