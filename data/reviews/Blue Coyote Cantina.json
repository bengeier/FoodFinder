{"text":"One would think that a prominent casino in phoenix Arizona would have a great Mexican restaurant.....this one does not. The food is awful. I got the nachos and the enchiladas. The nachos were made with stale chips and flavorless chicken among gobs of fake cheese sauce. The enchiladas, one green and one red, tasted very much like vinegar and had the consistency of mush. It's expensive and totally not worth it. Way too many good Mexican restaurants around to waste your time eating here."}
{"text":"The food is very basic of what you would find at any other bar. I've stayed at other 4 diamond award from triple A hotels,  and all the restaurants tend to be at the next level. This was a giant let down."}
{"text":"What a god-awful place One Step Above Taco Bell Services pretty shity no attentiveness only saw him to get drink water to get food order someone else brought the food and to give the check didn't ask if you wanted any Desert anything else no refills nothing service sucked food that's pretty bad no flavor I had said taste like Taco Bell I rather eat at the deli never go back here again"}
{"text":"Excellent choice!! Came here for my Dad's 89th bday dinner. Food was amazing and so were the drinks. Our waiter and waitress were perfect. Great customer service. Absolutely loved this place. Live music...had my daughter, nieces, and nephews groovin. Would definitely recommend and come back!!"}
{"text":"The BLUE COYOTE is actually a pretty decent diner. It doesn't really have an identity. It is a diner, with the name Cantina, that serves sushi and Japanese beer from their bar. However, their breakfast was legit in a time of need for some hangover TLC.

I ordered the Farm Scramble, which was bacon, sausage, ham, potatoes, cheese and scrambled egg served with a teenie tiny biscuit (that was burned). The scramble was actually outstanding - huge portioned. I'd order it again, no doubt.

3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The food here is surprisingly good.  From the free chips to the chimichanga, everything tasted fresh and delicious.  This is not the most authentic Mexican joint, but its perfect for the typical American palate.  The live entertainment was a nice touch as well."}
{"text":"First was a bit taken aback by the Denny's style restaurant decor in a casino. Granted I don't go to many casinos. My buddies had the mongolian beef that neither were excited about. They described it as \"ok\". I had the halibut...at least that is what is supposed to be. I have never tasted halibut like that. It was horrible. I was not able to eat my meal it was so bad. Sticking with the Denny's restaurants reference, Denny's is actually better than this place. Was fairly disappointed with the whole \"resort\"."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared the nachos with carne asada. They were very good, not your typical nachos. I had the scottsdale orange julius, which was my favorite drink and my husband had a peach tea, which he said was alright. Our service was good. Loved the chips, very salty."}
{"text":"Service was really bad, set us down at a table and that's were sat for like 15:00 min-- no one came to ask us if we wanted water!.. I had to flag a waiter down to ask who are waiter was.. my wife had the fish and chips , said it was good. I had cashew chicken, not so good.. got the feeling that we were invisible. Would not be"}
{"text":"We went here while staying at the hotel.  We came towards the end of happy hour to watch the NBA finals game.  The bar was pretty packed but luckily we were able to sit at a table with a good view of the 3 tvs above the bar.  The Happy hour specials were pretty boring so I ended up ordering a margarita.  It took 20 minutes to receive it!  Our food came faster than our drinks!!! The margarita was very standard-nothing to rave about.  The food was flavorful.  I ordered the California enchiladas (vegetarian). They were covered with red and green sauces (Christmas style)."}
{"text":"First time eating here, so far the atmosphere is pleasant and relaxing. The music upstairs adds a nice touch to dinner. We ordered the tacos since it's 2$ taco Tuesday, and both the Carne asada and Shrimp tacos were delicious and with the guacamole it had plenty of flavor. Will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"Darn good Mexican drinks and food, right inside the casino/event center. You'll have to navigate a set of stairs to get there, but it's worth it. The price is about what you'd expect at a casino bar - a little pricy but not outrageous. Oh, the drinks are quite large and it doesn't appear they skimp on the pour."}
{"text":"Sometimes you need to be lucky and explore a little bit to find a great restaurant. This place is  sequestered next to its companion eatery, The Blue Coyote Cafe on the level below the casino. I decided to check this place out as a pre-game meal before attending a show in the Showroom.

I ordered the Carnitas Torta and my wife ordered dessert called a Buneulo. The Torta came with the usual Carnitas goodness but was enhanced by the sliced avocado, chopped tomatoes and their crema sauce. What a perfect combination, this ranks right at the top with the the best Mexican food I have had. The chips came out hot and tasted so good that I didn't even bother with the salsa. They were salty, but tasted great.

The Buneulo is a crispy sugar bowl with ice cream in it and some honey drizzled on it. What a treat, it was delicious. I actually don't mind making this a destination restaurant when I don't have any outings planned at the casino. I thought the prices were reasonable and the service was excellent was well."}
{"text":"We came here before a comedy show.  Service started out very slow with our drinks. Chips and salsa were awesome.  Chicken tacos were EXCELLENT. Food was served VERY quickly. Overall a nice, reasonably priced place to eat."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Phoenix area! It's a gem in the talking stick casino on the lower level. It's always quiet and never busy which I am guessing people don't know about it. It's true Mexican cuisine not Americanized with tons of cheese melted in the salamander and refried bean. This is authentic & doesn't make your body feel upset after you eat.  Live guitar player always there as well and prices are right!  Think Barrio Queen (overhyped) but much better and less $$$$.
It's not Ajo Als or Macayo style, it's the real deal!"}
{"text":"They have truly the thickest chips for chip and salsa... I am sorry but I like my chips thin and flaky.. the pork tacos were equally disgusting very sweet with pineapple .. no thank you I eat Mexican food I want spicy not sweet as  I am not eating desert.. I was asked two time if I wanted flour or corn and still got the wrong thing"}
{"text":"We arrived at 9:55, five minutes before the kitchen closed on Tuesday. We wanted to order 5 tacos and told the bartender. She made eye contact with us and told us to wait and then walked in the back and talked (and laughed) with another employee. We waited, and then at 10, she came back out and told us that the kitchen had just closed. This was absolutely outrageous, and at first we thought she was joking. She was not. This was on 1/17/17."}
{"text":"Why would you advertise closing at 10pm if you're going to say you're already closed at 9:50...Because of this I no longer have a desire to even try the food here let alone support the restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped here for an appetizer before our concert held in The Showroom at Talking Resort. Sat at the bar, and they were busy. We ordered the guacamole & chips and Sopas.  The Sopas were delicious as was the guacamole."}
{"text":"Guacamole is good, my Moscow Mule is ok. They use the bar exact proper little shots on mixed drinks, but then again they are like that at the whole casino. People drinking wine are getting generous pours."}
{"text":"This place not authentic by any means, however is delicous! The margaritas are big and delicous. They offer many different kinds of tequila! Also the plates are not a bad price at all! About 10 bucks a plate! With premium ingredients!"}
{"text":"Usually a pretty solid choice for dinner when the Mrs. and I are at Talking Stick Resort/Casino.  It's nice that they serve two types of salsa with chips to start.  There is a pretty standard, but tasty red salsa and a spicier, smoky chipotle salsa that I especially liked.  The build your own margarita  option is nice because you can tailor you drink to your liking with choice of tequila, mix and liqueur float on top.  Chicken Tinga, barbacoa, carne asada are all good choices for tacos.  I can not recommend the pork Al Pastor as it was neither authentic nor particularly good since they overdid the addition of pineapple."}
{"text":"Outstanding...some of the best Mexican fare I've had in the valley and the service (from Gina) was absolutely outstanding. Most flavorvul guacamole I've ever had other than Barrio Queen - and the Carnitas were out of this world.

Well worth the trip to Talking Stick Resort for this little gem. The only thing I would recommend is to reformulate the sangria, which I thought was undrinkable. Great mojitos though!"}
{"text":"An absolute find. My wife and I \"Yelped\" our way here for dinner and we are certainly glad we did. First, it is downstairs in the Talking Stick Casino and away from all the cigarette smoke. Second, it was a treat to get there during happy hour (4:00 p.m.-7:00 p.m.) and receive top shelf drinks for $4.00 and discounts on appetizers and meals. Third, the food was outstanding. Fourth, the staff was friendly and very attentive. Wait, did I mention the food. Well prepared, flavorful, well proportioned and tastefully served. We will definitely make it a point for a return visit."}
{"text":"Love the build your own margarita concept and wish more restaurants offered this kind of variety. My personal fave is the banana margarita and I love that they have numerous brands (at various price points) of tequila to choose from.

I myself am NOT a liquor snob. I will drink the cheapest version of whatever's available, so Jose Cuervo was A-OK with me- although my girlfriends scoffed and chose pricier, more \"top-shelf\" versions for their own margaritas.

Whatevs, my $8 HUGE banana margarita made me a verrry happy girl!

As far as the service goes, I can't say it's spectacular but it isn't terrible either. 

The food here is good and reasonably priced which is a big plus. They have really excellent tortilla chips, but the salsa is somewhat bland. I've had quesadillas and shrimp tacos with rice and been pretty pleased with the taste of everything. 

I'm a big fan of Talking Stick and this is my fave eating establishment here, so I'll definitely be a frequent patron!"}
{"text":"One star for the pozole. One star for our waiter. Not our choice but the birthday boys. We were a large party of 13 so our server was great.

Chips even though fresh were extremely thick. Salsa even though it had a kick had a very floral taste that I didn't care for.

I ordered the pozole my husband the carne asada burrito. Food arrived fairly quickly considering we were such a large party. My soup was fine, not a lot of pork, mostly hominy but accompaniments fresh. Good taste.

Burrito even though large in size left us underwhelmed. Paid extra for enchilada style but had hardly any sauce. What sauce it did have had already soaked into the tortilla leaving it a soggy mess. The cheese on top had a off putting funk to it. My husband just ate the smoky flavored meat inside. Rice and beans tasteless.

For $50 for 2 it fell short. Maybe I'm just used to the gringo Mexican in Phoenix, but we'd take one of the Berto Brothers over Blue Coyote any day."}
