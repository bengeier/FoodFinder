{"text":"Ever since the sign was posted that this restaurant was coming in the Old Glow in the Dark mini putt location, I was counting the days. It is located in the Courtneypark plaza.   I think it took over a year but it finally opened. Today, I had a chance to try it out. I went for lunch today and I was impressed as soon as I walked in. The decor and the place its impressive. The restaurant is divided into a dining, bar/patio and the buffet areas.   However, in terms of food, it was so disappointing. I know it's buffet so you have to lowered your expectations but it wasn't very good. The food was so bland, with no hint of spice. Also in terms of meats, there was no beef, mostly chicken, one goat curry, fish tikka and fried shrimp. For $18, there's better value elsewhere.   Service was just average and the place wasn't even busy.   The 2* is based on the decor alone.   Not recommended.   P.S. Be careful when opening the lid of the food tray, as steam from those trays can burn you.  #12 of 2018"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight and I think I'll start with the good. The buffet room is really nice - it's actually a completely separate room. But that's about where the good things end.  The food is pretty terrible. Everything was pretty cold- likely because the lids were not on for any of the foods, any time I went in. They do have a huge variety but it is all of terrible quality. There's too much salt in some stuff and too much spices in many. The naan was chewy and crispy and not enough of it was being made, causing lineups for it at the buffet. The gulab jamun was barely warm (even after someone came in to refill it) and it was hard. The deserts tasted like they were bought from the sale rack at no frills and my friend and I were unable to take more than one bite.   I'm a huge food lover and will usually eat anything but I ended up throwing a lot of food here. It was a waste of my time and money. I definitely will not be returning and urge everyone to stay away!   P.s. this review is me being kind."}
{"text":"They just have lots of food on display. Im using the word \"display\" because thats exactly what it is. The  food is not meant to be eaten . It looks like there is lots of variety but infact its garbage put together. You walk in and think theres lots of food to try but as soon as you start you realise it was a mistake. But now its too late and you try other things in despair. You are gone too deep into the trap and cant back out . You still hoping that you will find something eventually thats worth putting into your mouth but you fail again. .. The plates are piling making you look like a pig who wants to eat non stop but infact you are desperately trying to find something that will justify your \"walking into the buffet\". Now comes the bill .. I went with my wife and spent $58 and change. Moral of the story is ... When Boston Pizza and Mucho Burrito is right around the corner why even take the risk??? Also Indian resturants are never about entertaining the guests and representing the Indian Cuisine.  They think its just another business that should be run based on profits. Hmmmm. I wonder why theres isnt single successful Indian chain of resturants in North America.  Im Indian myself and we should only keep ourselves to driving trucks and cabs. Maybe occasional Uber. God bless all. Especially ppl like Wendys A&W and McDonald's who give you full value for the money."}
{"text":"Not my choice of indian food it was not fresh. Customer service is depends on how much you pay them in tip.  Forever indian food choices Rajdhani sweets on bovaired(brampton), Avani indian bistro(matheson blvd). People like to eat Buffets but do you really think it worth 25$ plus taxes. Do you think they really cook all the food items everyday NO NO NO.   Will i go there again no not any chance, i dont recommend you guyz to waste money."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to eat here for a while since I love their location on Steeles in Brampton. Arrived at 4:30pm on a Saturday for an early dinner. It took 10 minutes to be seated, even though the restaurant was pretty empty, because the hostess was on the phone.  We had to ask our server for a drinks menu and barely saw her after that. In fact, another server (wish I had gotten her name!) came to ask us how we were doing much more frequently than our actual server.  At the buffet, there was a pretty good selection of items. All the items I had were good and I can't really complain about that. That being said, we had to wait 25 mins to get our naans and parathas, by which time our food had gotten cold (had ordered at the buffet and through our waitress, and still had to wait as apparently the chefs weren't informed of our order).  As we were leaving, we were asked about our experience, to which we replied that we weren't very satisfied with the service at all. A manager was called who came up with the excuse that they were busy. On a Saturday afternoon at 4:30pm, with 95% of the tables unoccupied.  So to summarize- Ambience/decor: gorgeous Food: pretty good Service: awful, with the exception of the one waitress  Price: not worth the $100 for 2 adults and 1 child considering the lack of service Don't think I'll be heading back. Only reason I'm even giving two stars is for the ambience/decor and the one waitress."}
{"text":"Swanky interiors, pleasant staff, average service and insipid, undercooked food unfortunately.   This new establishment near Cineplex has the right location and target customer base. So, they spent quite a lot of money in beautifully done interiors which is quite evident from the entrance itself. But don't let that fool you into believing that food will match the high standards you might expect for a $26 per head buffet!  Chaat station offers pani puri by the count of 4 which in itself is a hassle if you want more. Food stations are well kept but surprisingly food isn't even lukewarm. As of the taste, I found most of the curries lacking any distinct flavour. Bhatura was oily to the point where I gave up after first bite. Steam rice were undercooked and hard to bite in. Noodles could have used more time on the pan too. The only main course item I found worthwhile was Aloo Gobhi. As for the desserts, way average.   We are seriously disappointed in this place after walking into a glamorous setting. Hope their food matches up with the price they charge."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on a weekend. I was a little confused because of previous reviews but thought to give it a try  They offer more than 20 starters including chili chicken, chicken tikka,afgani chicken  The quality was really good. There were so much food that we were full before we could try everything  I would suggest to go once on weekend  Total more that 120 dishes"}
