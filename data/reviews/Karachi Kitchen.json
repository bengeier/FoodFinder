{"text":"Worst Customer Service!!!! Their food taste is never consistent"}
{"text":"Been a regular with these guys for 8 years now and have never been disappointed. Very reasonably priced and the food is always good. Like others you only get 2 pieces of chicken in biryani so order a side. Kebab rolls are awesome"}
{"text":"Yay I am a fan, i used to work near dixie and eglinton, so this place wasn't too far away, there were places closer but this is the best, if you want rice get their chicken biryani, for five bucks or so you'll have the most fun and if you do eat like normal people it's enough to serve three people or so, hehe, if you eat like me one per person. Other things you want to have here is seekh kababs, behari kababs, and reshmi kababs, you definitely do not want to have daal here or vegetables, at desi restaurants for some reason i've never had very good (daal) or vegetable curries. but the 'mystery' meat is amazing.....haha"}
{"text":"Karachi Kitchen is my favourite Pakistani food place! This is as perfect and authentic as it gets. I only wish it was a sitdown place because having to smell the irresistible deliciousness on the way back downtown from Mississauga in the car is just torture.  They have the best Bihari kebab(marinated tender beef cooked on a charcoal flame) I've had in Canada. Amazing Biryani(rice dish with either lamb or chicken) and mouthwatering curries. AND It's cheap to boot! I ordered 2 orders of bihari kebab, 4 naans(hot from a clay oven), and 2 different types of curries( to share ofcourse) and it only came up to $30!! They cater parties as well, and you can call ahead to order for pickup.  If you are serious about your curries and kebabs and don't mind spicy food, this place is the place to go."}
{"text":"One Word: Disgusting.   I ordered Butter chicken, Chicken Karahi and Lamb Karahi for take-out.  I had butter chicken all my life, hands down this tops the worst butter chicken list. I mean come on, the sauce has to be thick,bright orangy,aromatic and rich. No, Karachi kitchen's butter chicken was dull beige colored, bland and had the consistency of water. And the chicken tasted like they were reheated in the micro-wave. Both chicken and Lamb Karahi had some unpleasant tangy flavor.  The lamb had bones attached and the fat was not properly trimmed. Again both these dishes tasted like the sauce was prepared separate from the meat. Bottom line is for the money you are going to spend, you are better off buying the ingredients off the store and cook it your self."}
{"text":"I go here all the time and they serve great food. Living one street down from this place is awesome because you can satisfy your food cravings for just $5.65 after-tax. Always get the Chicken Biryani, they give you a TON of rice hence why the chicken seems so little to the other guy who wrote a review. You get your moneys worth and you will definitely leave feeling full. Oh and I forgot about the naan, freshly baked everyday. Gosh damn I'm hungry right now."}
{"text":"Bad Service , Over Priced, Chicken Tikka was too salty, extremely disorganized and They are scamming the government/public with the HST"}
{"text":"Slow service.  Bad customer service.  Ppl look lost that we were at a restaurant  to order food.  30 mins no food.  And still waiting"}
{"text":"Just had a nice Biryani fix. What a consistent place. Even after 4 years I still get the same happy feeling as the first time when I had my Biryani.   I am glad that I work so close to this place. I would say just shutup and take my money.   This is where other restaurants should come and learn how to make authentic Biryani."}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken and naan. The butter chicken was watery and tasted cheesy like they used old rotten cream in the recipe. The naan did not taste fresh at all. I was very disappointed with the food and even more so with the service. Never going back."}
{"text":"Their Bhari Kabaab is the best. They have very delicious Biryani and quantity is also very reasonable. Always recommended for Pakistani/Indian Desi"}
{"text":"I just got two words to say  FANTASTIC BIRYANI !!  In the last 10 years, i've never eaten chicken biryani because i always felt like the rice lacked the meat flavor. Here the rice blends in and has an amazing aroma. They have a couple of branches but always stick to the Dixie road branch for bryani. Its much much better and try to get there before 8.30 PM because the tend to run out of bryani."}
{"text":"I'm here all the time for lunch and it's amazing food for incredibly cheap.  Everyone there is really nice and quick, I'm usually holding my food after the 10 minute drive down there.    The chicken biryani is really good, spicy and made properly with saffron, peppercorns and whole cloves.  It's absolutely massive, 2 meals on it's own and it's less than $5 with tax.   Their butter chicken is fantastic, not too tomatoey and rich. The eggplant curry is really rich and spicy. The haleem is a standout, slow stewed beef in a thick wheaty gravy. I even like their daal, it's rich and spicy, and the spinach and potato curry is like 3 bucks and really filling. Their naans are gigantic, almost steering-wheel big, and thick and doughy.  Their reshmi kabobs are just sublime, so spicy and delicious. They make shami and bihari kebabs that are fantastic too.  They also offer fried fish, Basa, a river fish from Vietnam that is so tasty when done in a masala batter.  The best part may actually be their desserts, they make a killer kheer, rice pudding with cardamom and a decent gajjar ka halwa.   I keep coming back here all the time, and it's always delicious and fresh. Give it a try if you want great food for great prices."}
{"text":"This is just not flavorful ... not much to say. Let's not call it Indian or Pakistani food.  It is good if you want to just fill up on something.  The only thing I would eat here would be Haleem if I had no other options"}
{"text":"I went to the Dixie road location. It was take out only. It took quite a while to get my order. I think I waited over 20 minutes. Next time, I'm def ordering over the phone before going in.  Their bihari kabab was amazing!! one of the best i have ever had in my life. The haleem was a bit disappointing. Not very flavorful or spicy.  I'll definitely go back and try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Quick take-out only service. We had garlic naan, masala fried fish, and chana masala. The latter was too soupy to eat in the car so can't comment yet but the fish (with raita) and naan were delicious and not too greasy."}
{"text":"came in for lunch with my family. did a multiple orders. the guy messed it up. I ordered a chikken tikke and the maet was half cooked. It seemes like he iwas in a hurry since it was lunch time. I'd doubt i would come here again"}
{"text":"Worst place on planet. Not a place that you would like to waste your money. The food is so terrible that you better stay hungry. I asked for recommendations and out of all the menu they suggested for me to have beryani. Fish pakoras were soggy and tasteless. The only good thing was Diet Coke."}
{"text":"Wow.  Awful.    Ordered butter chicken, container had 7 small little chunks of chicken.  Pathetic.  Ordered 3 chicken kebab wraps which had only a small strip of ground chicken in them.  Wraps came with 6-7 pieces of fries that were soggy and almost under cooked.  Fried fish pieces I swear were made from some awful fish like carp or something.  How could I tell?  The texture and appearance of the fish...I'm a fisherman and know what carp looks like when cooked (not that I eat/ate it).  Only thing that was halfway decent was the rice with chicken and the curry goat which had slightly more pieces of meat than the butter chicken.  I had high hopes because this place is close to home but our experience was awful and I'm not willing to take another chance on it!"}
{"text":"They dont do bihari kababs anymore. The seekh kabab in paratha was decent. The bihari boti was decent as well. The chicken karahi is passable.   I asked the person at the counter to do a reprint of the receipt and she was not willing to help me at all. I cant imagine that reprinting a receipt is rocket science."}
{"text":"Not at all impressed with this chain.  I've gone to the Scarborough location (which by far is the worst) and this one.  The food is really overpriced for small portions.  I ended up paying $30 for 2 butter chickens and 2 biyrani's, that had very little meat in it, and sauce as not existent.  Quality of the butter chicken was just copious amounts of sugar.  Horrible!  I would make a review on the scarborough location as well which is probably the worst of all the locations... but they dont have one on yelp."}
{"text":"Not at all impressed with this location for Karachi Kitchen.  Paid $30 for 2 butter chickens and 2 biyrani's, that had both had very little meat in it.  Biryani had no spice whats so ever.  Quality of the butter chicken was just copious amounts of sugar and the container was filled half way (pretty stingy for their most expensive and \"popular\" dish\".  Food was horrible and uneatable, most of it was thrown in the garbage!  If you want to throw your money down the drain, visit this location, it'll find its way to the trash."}
{"text":"Small servings. Lamb curry has considerable no's of bones. Gravy was tasty. There are better values around for curry takeout."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I went here tonight for the first time for takeout. Where do I begin?  I walked in and since I didn't know the menu, I asked if there was some sort of combo dish with rice and a few items that I could try. The woman just said sorry there is no rice tonight. She said they ran out of rice.  I was disappointed because I always get rice when I order Indian food. So, I ordered butter chicken, naan, and some samosas.  The food was expensive. The butter chicken was watery and more like soup. The samosas were very tiny. The food didn't taste bad, but it didn't really taste good either. The service was also just ok (not rude, but not very friendly).  I don't think I will be back anytime soon. If I do come back, I will not order the butter chicken."}
{"text":"Went to Dixie location. They told us that in order to get a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich we would have to go to meadowvale location. Arrived at 2:30 pm. They advised (in a very rude manner) us that most menu options weren't available until 4. And that many options had been discontinued. Why not update menu then? We came from Hamilton(45mins away). Horrible customer service. They also didn't give us water, I had to ask 10 minutes after we got food. We were also the only ppl there so I don't think it was a result of it being to busy. The food was absolutely amazing. Chicken karahi, chicken briyani, naan, and seekh Kabab. But I don't think I would go back due to the poor service."}
{"text":"The owners please take notice of the Afghani woman that works on the cash (sorry for categorizing her ethnicity) but she is extremely rude and disrespectful. I have been a customer ever since the restaurant opened. I requested her to substitute a leg piece for a thigh and even offered to pay extra when she declined however, she bluntly refused saying that it is not possible since the biryani is already pre-made her explanation made no sense at all. It wasn't her declining my request that made me upset but rather her making obscene gestures for no apparent reason. I have never been treated so poorly in any restaurant in my whole life you definitely lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"From last many years, i am a regular at takeout location at dixie road Mississauga, awesome chicken biryani- spicy and mild both are good. Kabab rolls always fresh. Did order for a 50+ guest catering and delivery was on time, fresh food."}
{"text":"Have been eating at Karachi kitchen for 4 years now. Their biryani is AMAZING. Their curries are just average.  I have tried biryani from every restaurant from GTA, I have to say, Karachi kitchen has the best biryani. The service is quick and there's always a lot of customers lined up here when I arrive. However, the service is always quick and very friendly!   Every time I come here, I get several chicken biryanis. Their spicy chicken biryani is always fresh, moist and the chicken is super flavourful.  I come here on a weekly basis just for their biryani. So good!"}
{"text":"My family was visiting from New York, they ordered kabab rolls and got addicted to it hence started a trend of having kebab rolls whenever visiting. I myself have ordered biryani, nihari as well and it's all great! This place does well  for a takeout place and I was have to wait on the seats because there are others before me. However if u are craving a pakistani dine in experience there's a place literally right across from them and it's a buffet (hidden behind Food Basics)."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.. The staff is so very kind and polite  5 star customer service and dining experience"}
{"text":"I have been getting Catering done for years now with them for any big Family dinners and lunches. This location has a better chef then Medowale town centre location.   Price: its not too expensive and not too cheap either, when compared to other similar business in the area.  Food: that's what you pay for. The food is good and cooked properly. Their chicken biryani is quite good.  Service: Their order service is quite fast but when you go for pick up usually they are slow and you have to wait.... Make sure you check all the items as they always forget to give raita (yoghurt sauce). Happened to me 3 times.   Parking: there is plenty of parking as it part of strip mall.   All in all the FOOD keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"Small takeout restaurant with a fairly basic menu. The key is the Biryani here. It can range from God to excellent. The lamb biryani, available on weekends only, tends to be the best. Issue is that they will frequently run out very early or just not have availability. Chicken biryani is good but tends to be a notch below others. Portions are quite large. Resuming Kebabs, fish, paya, karahi dishes are good to very good. Recommended."}
{"text":"Great food but no respect for customers. Tells you pickup will be ready in 30 min only for you to wait another 30 at the store. It's happened three times!! I have frequented this place for 6 years despite the price hikes. Not going back any more. The biriyani and fried fish taste great. But the majority of the other items leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"A great Pakistani takeout in Mississauga, exactly what you would expect. Karachi kitchen is the fulfilment of the expectations I have come to have of the GTA dinning experience. Uncompromising authentic!      The food is good. There is a place to sit while you wait. Customers stream in and out constantly, the sounds of the kitchen can be heard in the front of house.   The menu is displayed on two large screens behind the counter. Do not count on everything being available. This place makes things fresh everyday and they usually start to run out of the more popular menu items, like biryani, in the early afternoon.   Ask the person behind the counter what they still have. They know most customers will buy something even if they have run out of some of the menu.  The type of place that I can make a staple of my eating out roster."}
{"text":"This establishment was recommended to me several times by food afficionados, so I had to see for myself what all the hype was about.  I was warned beforehand that it was take-out only, but that never deters me, I literally post up outside take out spots with my mates and we slay food off our trunks.   The Behari Kebab was outstanding, literally exploding with flavour and presented not in your standard kebab manner. Seekh Kebabs were the next best and quite possibly the best  \"seekh kebabs\" I have ever had. So juicy and seasoned perfectly, I was in heaven thus far. We also ordered reshmi kebabs but I was not overly impressed, I believe it was chicken but also tasted as tho there were egg in it too but just not for me.   Butter chicken was creamy, thick and seasoned well, this is not the establishment you would go to if you were looking for the best BC in the GTA, but nonetheless it was solid. Raita was delicious too, again seasoning was on point and it was refreshing.   Biryani is supposedly what KC is known for along with the kebabs and nihari. We had the chicken biryani and it was delicious, big chunks of chicken and tasted great. The fried fish was delicious too, crispy, seasoned well and nice texture. Good naan as well.   Unfortunately I was not able to try the nihari but I know I'll be back here soon, there is no question. On average the portions are fair and run you approximately $5 each, just unbelievable.   I asked for hot/pepper sauce but they did not have any. The food is spicy but I always need that extra jolt, so maybe I'll roll with my own homemade batch next time."}
{"text":"Great tasting food. Portions sizes are good for the price. The butter chicken was a little let down, not enough pieces of chicken.   Overall a great place to try."}
{"text":"Deciding between the veal or lamb biriyani, I went for the veal spicy (veal biriyani?) and it was a SOLID MEAL. Tender meat with more flavor than spicy I'd say. Few bones with the servings, which is great. Definately hits the spot (have to try the lamb now)."}
{"text":"Rice. Lots and lots of rice.   I ordered the Chicken Biryani which came so highly recommended, and boy, do they give you a lot of rice. Check out the pics I uploaded. The box is absolutely stuffed with flavorful, aromatic rice. I swear after poking around I thought to myself, \"um... where's the chicken\" as it takes a good amount of digging before you find the treasure, two chicken drumsticks buried in the mountain of carbs.  Don't take this as a complaint though, the rice has a good aroma, is flavored nicely with saffron and is generally really good. On the downside, the chicken itself was small (like I mentioned, two small drumsticks) and didn't have much seasoning, but for $5 it's a good deal overall.   If you want a cheap meal, enjoy Indian rice or want to feel like a pirate searching for treasure, check out the chicken biryani. I'll probably try other items on the menu though if I go back."}
{"text":"Keep in mind it is only a takeout restaurant that serves the most delicious and mouthwatering chicken biryani ever in the entire GTA and I am not exaggerating.  It is only $5 bucks with a huge portion size. Their naans are exceptional and Haleem is to die for. I haven't tried anything elase besides these three items. These 4 stars are based on the aroma and the flavor of Biryani, naan, and haleem. On top of that, the staff is very friendly and down to earth."}
{"text":"Wow! I've never seen a place offer so much value. We had the Chicken Biryani and one of the curries. Most things on the menu are $5-8. The biryani and curries were both very flavorful. I'm no expert of Indian/Pakistani food but I can tell the food has a lot of spices in it so the taste is very rich. The portion on the Biryani was STUNNING! Admittedly it was mostly rice with maybe 3 pieces of chicken, but we finished satisfied and that's all that matters!   Will come again!"}
{"text":"I have tried the Dixie location and there is something wrong with this MTC location.   Although they sell the same dishes, prices are different. The level of spices used also seems to differ. I find this location to be much lighter in taste. Take the fried fish for example. This place charges you $7.99 for a box with 8-9 pieces. he Dixie one charges $5.99 for about 6 pieces. I'm fine if a franchise doesn't want to standardize prices, but the MTC one's fish was very bland.   Also, don't bother with their lunch special. If you like to be cheap, you are only screwing yourself. Their specials boasts a long list of stuff but you only get like a sprinkle of each item. Except for rice which they will happily pack into your box.   I tried their grilled meats once. You should take your money to Café de Khan or Aunty's Kitchen which are not too far away. The grilled meats here lack the punch I would expect from an Indian/Pakistani place. Save your money. I'm not coming back. This place is only good if you have no taste buds and just want to feel full on rice."}
{"text":"No complaints - was jonzing for briyani and they had it - don't have too much to compare this place with others - ordered the rashmi chicken kabob with chicken briyani - kabob was a bit dry - but overall good flavour"}
{"text":"This place has gone through a few different lives.  It used to be a busy Joey's Seafood then became, Tandoori time.  As TT it was really good and then it reopened or rebranded as Karachi Kitchen.  Very little in the way of decor has changed.  Its still has the Joey's tables.  So I brought my six year old daughter here for dinner on a Saturday evening.  As most people have noted the restaurant is really geared up for a takeout business.    One of the first misnomers on the menu is it says that they have burgers.  My daughter was all over that - wanting a burger.  However appearances can be deceiving and they really just put a kebab in a burger bun, and bury it under a sea of mayonnaise.  My daughter described it as disgusting.  I tried it and it was rather bland, compared to kebabs I have had elsewhere.  The horde of Mayo was too much though.  I think that even Burger King uses less mayo.  She's not as heavily into Indian-esque food as I am.  Please don't call one food something when it really isn't.  I had the Beef Paya.  I had wanted the lamb, but the girl was saying that since it was Ramadan they weren't serving lamb.  The beef was served with Naan.  Two things I didn't like was the sea of oil that the beef was swimming in, and that the Naan had been buttered.  The beef tasted good, and like most Pakistani food, it was as hot as a volcano in July.  On to the washroom.  To put it kindly it was dark and dirty.  There was no toilet paper, and even the supply cupboard in the washroom didn't have any so we used paper towels instead."}
{"text":"A bit on the expensive side and not much substance comes with the price, I would recommend babu's for more volume and cheaper cost and faster service, had to wait 10 min for one curry no queue. Granted that's not Pakistani food. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Headline: Decent food for really cheap prices  So a heap load of rice and a couple large pieces of chicken for $5? Fried fish for $5? Can't beat that price.    As I am getting older, my spice tolerance has decreased so I ordered the chicken biriyani and fried fish.  The biriyani was tasty and still had a nice kick to it.  What I liked most about it was they give you a huge chicken leg and a wing with a few slices of chicken.  While some would prefer diced chicken, I much prefer meat on the bone. Also for $5 for 2 pcs of chicken is cheaper than a KFC or Popeye's.  I also ordered the fried fish.  Fish is nicely battered, has a slight burnt taste to it, but you can definitely tell it's fish.    Dislike - takeout only  Verdict: Meal on the cheap. Great value. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Love their biryani and fried fish. They been around for years. But don't know how they manage small place."}
{"text":"The store lists as closing at 10 pm on a Sunday night had my husband walk in before 7. And lady at the front cash looks at my husband and then walks to the back and says \"I'm not serving anyone else\""}
{"text":"Having crazy cravings for Pakistani food I go to my source for food info - Yelp.  Based on the reviews I had to check this place out. I could help but notice how reasonable the pricing was here. Bonus point for that. Super crazed by hunger, Our order was as follows:  Channa Masala, Butter Chicken, Vegetable Biryani, Mixed Vegetables, Fried Fish, Beef Kabob and 4 Naan (garlic and plain).    The Channa Masala. I could not bring myself to even try this dish due to insane amount of Ghee that was soaked throughout. My friend dug into it and said that it was poorly done and extremely oily.  The Butter Chicken.  I have eaten many a Pakistani BC in my life and can honestly say that this was not BC. It was something else. Maybe an order mix up?  It tasted like sweet sour cream with chicken bits. A big H-No to this dish.  The Veg Biryani. Now here was a great tasting rice dish. I wish I was eating it now. Lol. Melt in your mouth Cauliflower with basmati rice flavoured so perfectly.   A must! The Mixed Veg. To sum it up with as few words as possible - Aight!   The Fried Fish. Yummy deep fried goodness.    A must try.   The Beef Kabob. They were just alright in my opinion.  The Naans. The garlic and plain were both good.  The service was friendly and the price was on point. Plenty of parking too.  Note that this branch of the Karachi K is takeout only. When ordering via telephone make sure to confirm that it is the Dixie location.  Peace out Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I really like ethnic food and usually frequent Pakistani restaurants with family and tonight was one of those nights. We ordered Kharahi chicken, chicken biryani, Kebobs and butter chicken, another other items. The Kabobs seems to have been made before and they just warmed it for us (that's a big no-no) they are supposed to make fresh food. And the butter chicken tasted like eating out a garbage can - disgusting butter chicken ever.."}
{"text":"Great food, great place to eat spicy Pakistani food with family. Friendly atmosphere and reasonable priced menu."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  I had there chicken biryani and loved it.  It had a nice spice to it and would recommend it to others.  Also had an order of their butter chicken.  It was delicious and saucy.  Come and try their food."}
{"text":"Despite reading all the negative reviews decided to go there on the way from work to get some takeout.   The spices were actually good. I liked the bhindi. However, the fish curry not good at all. Very dry and not tasty at all. The naans were very dry and tasteless. They messed up my order, when I got home I realized instead of biryani rice they give us something called shahi paneer. ( which was lots of sweet sauce with maybe 7 pieces of paneer.  All the portions were small."}
{"text":"Tried this for light lunch with chicken samosa and chicken pilaf. Pilaf was traditional n flavourful . Only negative where they loose point is that place unhygienic, tables dirty . Hygiene a big thing for me place n cannot compromise . May not come for dine in n may do take out !"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service by the girls who work here. I wanted to place catering order and they deleted my order and told me something else and then girl says that \"do you want to place order or not\". Is that how you get someone's business?   I refuse to give them my business ever again.   The owner is very nice. He has provided really good customer service when the last time I went there for buffet brunch. However their employees need to learn"}
{"text":"Sorry but the food is no where near Karachi food so please if you don't want to be compared then take the Karachi out of your name,  Secondly they should mention take away food only no eat in. Because I didn't see any sign and wasn't aware of it.   Lastly apart from good quality taste, quantity is really less as well."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick and great value. We ordered their chicken biriyani, butter chicken, aloo palak and naan. Their flavors are spot on, not too spicy but enough heat to keep things authentic. Their naan was light and fluffy, butter chicken - very creamy ( a bit too much for my liking but my partner liked it) and their chicken biriyani delicious. We had enough for lunch the next day. If you are around the neighborhood and looking for some take out, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Might I say, best biriyani ever?! Probably not the truest statement, but still, the biriyani is pretty damn good! And for $5 something bucks, quite the deal.   Karachi Kitchen is a takeout joint. They have recently undergone some renovations and fancied up the place a bit. Pakistani owned, so don't expect the best butter chicken or fish (both are Indian delicacies). But, go ahead and order yourself some biriyani, haleem, nihari and kebabs. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"A good treat if you are in mood for Pakistani food! If you are looking for value and taste, the combination is Karachi Kitchen. We mostly order this for our group gatherings as it's affordable in bulk quantity. This is a take out location and it's a pretty busy location, so make sure you order well in advance.  The Biryani here has a distinctive taste which makes it special, the spice level is good, but not too much. The best part is that the other items on menu are delicious as well specially the Reshmi Kababs and surely the Chicken Tikka, it's marinated so well, you will savor it till last. Even the Karahi and Nihari are tasty as well.  The downsize to this place is the wait time, if you haven't ordered well before, there are high chances you will have to wait long. Once I ordered bulk quantity the night before for early pickup the next morning, but still had to wait 45mins, was told they were short staffed. Also when you call them, you should be lucky that they pick up in first call because they are so busy, so keep trying, there have been times I have called 10times before I actually someone. All in All, the wait is worth it and you will never regret it !!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical since it was my first time and the large man behind the counter seemed to SEVERELY lack ethics of customer service. He had some phone conversation going on and just didn't seem to care that customers had walked in and wanted service. Thankfully he went into the kitchen and a lady came out, who was nicer.  We ordered Biryani, Seekh Kabab and Bihari Kabab. All three were superb. I love Silver Spoon biryani, but am tempted to replace them now.  Fifteen thumbs down for the fat, unethical guy and 50 thumbs up for food!"}
{"text":"Interesting how the same brand at the Dixie location could be so superb at the food, while this would could be so awful!  Problems we ran into: 1. They got our order wrong and replaced Bihari Kabab with some tasteless chicken 2. Generally, food was bland... 3. The salad with Seekh Kabab was stale  Biryani was decent, but pricey.   I don't think we will go to this location again. Will have to drive to the Dixie branch instead."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for good cheap eats.  Their prices are very reasonable, and the quality is good, but you do get what you pay for in terms of portion and amount of meat.  We have ordered the Chicken Biryani and the Fried Fish.  There is also a daily walk-in special for about $5.00."}
{"text":"Very bad food. We ordered butter chicken and karachi lamb. Butter chicken very thin gravy and tasteless chunks of chicken 3cm in size.  Lamb was uncooked. We also ordered seekh kebab and that was soaking in oil still uncooked. Waste of time money and food."}
{"text":"If you like Pakistani flavors, try this place. Their Chicken Biryani (fried chicken mixed with rice) is really good. The best thing about this place is the the food is always fresh. The serving is really good especially the rice dishes. I have tried other places too, but quality and taste wise I like their Chicken Biryani.  You can order mild or spicy. There are other dishes too, like Chicken Tandori, Fish Pakoras , fresh Naan.They also carry Pakistani desserts like rice puddings, sweet yellow color rice.  Prices are reasonable, around $5-7.  Their kebabs are not so fresh as I found them extremely cold  from inside, had to return it.   There is no eating area, take out only. The entrance is quite shabby, they can do better. 4 stars is for the food."}
{"text":"Wasn't a fan of the butter chicken - it was very onion-y. Their naan is cheap and good so I often get it for when I'm cooking Indian at home, but even just to get that usually takes 20 minutes. I have heard good things about the biryani but have yet to try. If I had my pick of Indian places this wouldn't make the cut but it's convenient for me so!"}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends this past week end and was a bit apprehensive from reading some of the past reviews! What a nice surprise as the Pakistani food taste was spot on.  This is a no nonsense sit down and tuck in kinda joint as it has a fast food vibe to it but the portions are generous and very tasty. We had the Chicken Karahi, Haleem, Nihari, chicken Biryani and a Dal with boneless chicken tikkas and the freshly made naan....all amazing! I would definitely recommend this joint if you want good Pakistani food and don't care much for ambience!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just the chicken biryani, it's cheap and filling, everything else is not worth the money. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"The food is tasty. Chicken tikka, butter chicken, and naan is good. I think the chicken biryani needs chicken pieces mixed in the rice. It would have been nice to have a place to sit and eat. The staff needs to know the prices of the items when ordering over the phone."}
{"text":"Get yourself a tonne of flavourful food on the cheap!!   I am vegetarian but sometime while I was pregnant with my daughter I was craving fish and indulged \"just once\". Turns out I am having difficulty kicking the habit and it is especially difficult with a place like this around!!   I have the vegetarian biryani which was under $5 and lasted for 3 meals! As well as the fried fish which I think is $5. The veg biryani is not made with chicken broth and cooked separately from the meat items. The flavour initially was okay but great after pouring the included sauce over it and even better the next day. The fish? Omg the fish! Crispy outside and moist juicy soft fish inside. Absolutely perfect! I drool just thinking about it.  It is take out only which is fine by me and it looks like they renovated recently. I was told the place looks ghetto but it definitely does not!  My food was made to order so super fresh. We had to wait 20 minutes for it but it was so fresh that even after driving home to Toronto with it I still managed to burn the roof of my mouth!  Oh, one more note about the biryani, I have never seen such long grain rice! It has got to be 3x longer than the rice we use at home and it is cooked to perfection!  Update: we continue to eat here and maintain that the food is superb but have to drop them a couple stars because we need a strategy when ordering from here. We have to anticipate how late the food will be, order that far in advance and then show up at least 30 minutes later than they tell you it will be ready. Unfortunately this doesn't even work. Sometimes we order an hour in advance, they say it'll be ready in 20 minutes, we get there after an hour and still have to wait anywhere between 15-30 minutes. These folks are simply determined to keep you waiting."}
{"text":"This place makes the best Chicken Tikka & Behari Kabobs, my only complaint is that I live too far away!  Friendly counter staff, nice waiting area for a take-out place, and they're pretty fast.   Just wish they had dine-in, since I drive here from the east end of Scarborough.  This place makes me Happy :-)"}
{"text":"A restaurant that closes for lunch,unbelievable. Went for lunch today with my son, he wanted a real Desi feast I like this place, lousy ambience but good food. But they won't sell us food as they were all eating lunch,we would have to go elsewhere or wait for them to finish lunch break. Never heard of a restaurant going on a lunch break, its prime biz time."}
{"text":"Good Indian / Pakistani take out. Tried their Veal Biryani. They do not have a display counter like some of the other restaurants. So, you cannot pick something by looking and pointing. However, the food was fresh and appetizing."}
{"text":"Very good chicken biryani. Great portions, flavorful and authentic tasting. The inside decor is nice too!"}
{"text":"Just did chicken biryani take-out since I had a craving and didn't have it in a long time. Looked for the closest place to my work. Ordered it and went to pick up around 1. It was empty. The food ready and piping hot. Did the trick. I'm not a biryani connoisseur but it was tasty. The only thing I hate is that they use chicken with bones but oh well. I liked it nevertheless, good chicken rice ratio. The rice was a bit dry at the bottom of the styrofoam container. Their menu has the typical Indo-Pakistani dishes. Would go there again."}
{"text":"Tried their chicken biryani and naan and both were amazing. The price is amazing and you defiantly get your money's worth."}
{"text":"They have a new location at Meadowcale Town Centre where you can get steaks and ribs as well, I thought it was odd at first but man were those amazing ribs!! definitely try the butter chicken with naan as well and the best part is that its so cheap  :)"}
{"text":"This is not a spot where you can sit down and eat, rather they do almost 100% carry out business. We got the chicken Biryani { Biryani, also known as biriyani, biriani or briyani, is a South Asian mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It is popular throughout the subcontinent and among the diaspora from the region}.  I must freely admit - it fits the harshest criteria: super generous portions, relatively low prices and tastes pretty good considering the super fast turnaround time once ordered. So it gets a high ranking IMHO."}
{"text":"This spot - located in a tiny strip mall, is clearly geared towards 100% carry out (or takeaway as it is know in some parts of the world). Having said that, their menu is by no means limited and you can find most of the Pakistani/Punjabi/classic Mughal style entrees available. I have tried their Biryani items, which I must say are quite good given the price. The quantity is also again quite generous for the price. Spice levels are appropo for the cuisine style, but those who value aromatic food will enjoy it. Basic summary: affordable, but not often consistent."}
