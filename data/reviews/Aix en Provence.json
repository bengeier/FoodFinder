{"text":"My favorite French restaurant. That brings me back to lyonnaise cuisine. They took great care of my food knowing that I'm pregnant. Love this place."}
{"text":"I had one of the best meals of my life last night here!  I had the mussels to start and the were perfectly tender with a phenomenal light but flavor intense broth. Then I had the parsnip soup. Hands down one of the best soups I've ever had. It was delicate and silky, garnished with a cilantro drizzle that added just the right pop and accompanied by a goat cheese crouton that added crunch and depth. Then I tried the kale salad. The kale was massaged correctly to give it a tender texture and dressed lightly but had beautiful layers of flavor. For my main entree I had the duck. Perfect way to end because the lardon gave me that saltiness I like to end my dinner with. Don't forget to finish with a housemate tart of some sort. I hard lemon and was completely satisfied!!!  The food and the service exceeded my expectations. Must try!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and a delightful journey starting from beginning to end. The food was well prepared and full of flavor.  My cassoulet was an experience in itself and the duck was was soft and tender ... just thinking about it makes my mouth watered. My wife had the red snapper, a special for that day and that too was equally as good. We've been to a lot of French restaurants here in the US and this is by far one of our very few favorite, and that's saying something because it's really hard to impress my wife with French food since she lived there for a while too.   The only 1 negative that I would comment on Aix-en-Provence was the server took a little bit of time to come to get our order and server could be a bit more engaging.  However,  that was not enough to take not make this a 5 star experience for us. We finished all of our food and the Paris Brest was an excellent way to finish off our night. We will definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"This is an update on my last review. 20 people from our dining out group went to Aix en Provence on Tuesday, March 8th. We had reservations for 28, but there is quite a bit of illness floating around our condo this spring. The eight cancellations came in on the day of our reservation. The owner of the restaurant was visibly upset that we were eight people short. We apologize profusely noting the illness of the patrons.  He made a snide comment and disappeared into the kitchen. That's not what you would expect when you have twenty paying customers on your doorstep. The two waiters assigned to our tables made up for the slight. Our waiter, Brian, had an exceptional touch in guiding our table through the dinner menu and wine list.  The mussels were superb. They were tender and in a mildly spicy broth. The canard cassoulet was rich and spicy and delicious. The sausage and lardons played off the duck very well. And, The white beans mellowed out the richness of the rest of the dish.  Even the hardest nosed gourmets at our tables had nothing but praise for the dishes that came out of the kitchen. It's a shame that the owner did not come out to visit at our tables as he is done previously. Maybe his attitude would have improved had he heard the kind comments from the diners in our group. Upon our leaving, Brian wished us a good night and thanked us for visiting the restaurant. We will go back.    My dining out partner and I are part of a dining out group. We were scouting out a new restaurant for the March event and chose Aix en Provence. We went there midweek. The owners have updated the restaurant. It is quite pleasant and warm feeling. Even though the menu is limited, there is enough variety where a diner has choices. The wine list is decent both by the bottle and by the glass. The service was superb. I ordered the escargot. It was nicely done with a miniature puff pastry on top of each snail. However, it did not have enough garlic for my taste. My partner had the frog legs. They were tasty and tender. My fresh pasta dish was perfectly done with a lamb ragout. In a ragout I prefer chunks of meat to diced meat as it was served. The French press coffee was strong, rich and flavorful without being bitter. The lemon tart was light and bright without the usual strong lemon aftertaste. It is served with a small scoop of thyme and basil flavored sorbet. It was refreshing. We will be going there in March with approximately 20 diners. We have high expectations; the manager said they can handle the crowd."}
{"text":"Took my husband here for his birthday. The service was excellent; they even brought us each a glass of champagne to celebrate! Cocktails were yummy and the food was great: we ordered the escargot which was hands down our favorite of the food we enjoyed. Hubby ordered the duck confit for dinner which was delicious and I had the lobster spaghetti which was good but probably not something I'd order again. Great restaurant for a date but probably not a spot we'd add to our regular rotation. I would give this 4.5 stars if Yelp would let me!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went several months ago and I'm now just getting around to the review. The food was just wonderful as was the service. The wine selection is one of the best in town and the service hands down the best. Life's gotten in the way but we'll be back soon. Thank you for such a lovely evening!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful. From the quality of olive oil, the farm style bread and with an emphasis on simplicity and on the basics it's a true gem.  I did not find the price to be in the expensive range, and the portions were, well for lack of better comparison - European size. I really enjoy it when the food is allowed to be the star and not the chef (which non intuitively really means the chef is a superstar) The salad dressing was so flavorful and yet so lightly applied that the greens look so fresh and undressed. Give this spot a try and you will not regret it."}
{"text":"MYERS PARK IS THE PLACE TO EAT IN CHARLOTTE!   Stagioni's, Lumere, Deejai, RU RU's, Napa, etc!   But let's talk about Aix en Provence! Tucked away in a modest but perfect location off Providence road. Wonderful shaded outdoor seating 57 seats available inside for a intimate experience. Brian, front man and Patrick, Ex. Chef, have built a unforgettable experience.  First off, Brian remembered me from a previous dinning experience and treated us like King & Queen during our anniversary. Flowers and Champagne were strategically set as my wife and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary, big points from the beginning.   Our server was knowledgable of the menu and provided pairings with each of our first courses, spot on. Please try the Foi Gras small plate, it is a unintentional play on PB&J which will make you smile.   Octopus makes you sing \"I'm in love the the Pulpo\"  while the Pheasant and Lamb Tagine  are extremely impressive (Pictures Posted)   5 Star experience, service, food, and great anniversary memory!   Thank You!"}
{"text":"This follow-up review merely confirms Aix en Provence is in the top 5% of restaurants in Charlotte. Very high quality food expertly prepared. For authentic, satisfying French cuisine- this is it. It's our go-to restaurant for treating out of town guests to a wonderful, special evening out."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited during Queen's Feast/Charlotte Restaurant Week and were told that they were only serving from the Queen's Feast menu...if that is the menu for they selected for the fixed price week, I cannot wait to return and experience their typical menu (or maybe they were treating their customers to the typical menu). The wonderful menu was followed by service and food that exceeded our high expectations. Brian was our server and both he and Patrick spent time visiting with us during our meal but not in a, \"How is your meal tonight?\" typical restaurant fashion. Their visits and conversation were welcomed and certainly will be again when we visit next (and we will!)."}
{"text":"Well, first off I want to say I visited this restaurant during queens Feast aka restaurant week. Appetizer: Butter Lettuce - tasted good but was very salty much like most food in Charlotte. Main Course : Bavette Provenca - very undercooked and super chewey and it was honestly not editable. I should have said something but I did not. The other person I was with had the same thing and his was fine. Desert : devils food cake - probably the best part of the meal along with my tea. Again, it could have been better without the dried fruit which made is oddly sweet. So, all in all I am going to say it was 'ok' and I probably will give them another chance. Another thing that was quite odd, we asked for a normal menu and they basically did not have one. I mean if you are doing restaurant week and want people to come back? Have a menu for people to see? Common sense IMHO. Also, this restaurant is very odly placed and very hard to find. Hope this was not too long. But, this was my experience and I shall try them again."}
{"text":"We celebrated a friend's special occasion and the service was very hospitable! I tried the lamb and pasta tagliatelle with lamb which was phenomenal!! Succulent meat roasted to a savory melting consistency with incredible lemon and spices. The pasta was warm, al dente texture and comforting with the meat.   Octopus a la plancha appetizer was prepared differently due to seasonal change in the menu. We had it roasted with white beans and chorizo. I love octopus! Not crazy about the beans (in general)but the Chorizo was perfect to add a little kick.  It's very small inside so make a reservation and prepare to be cozy with the neighbors.  I wasn't feeling well so while the wine list looked extensive I did not try anything. My friend highly recommended the cocktails because they specialize in vintage mixed drinks and her drink looked fabulous. Nice small bite on the house to start like the French do!"}
{"text":"Aix En Provence is a gem in the Queen City! I highly recommend this restaurant. The food is absolutely exquisite and the service is top notch. If you are looking for French cuisine, it is THE place to eat at! The authenticity and deliciousness of the seasonal dishes invite guests to evade for a few hours and make them feel as if they were suddenly in France."}
{"text":"Some of the best food we have had.  Service is a little stiff and the waiters need to relax a bit."}
{"text":"I usually never write a review about a Restaurant Week experience because it's typically not their best food but we had such a great experience I had to rave about it! Tucked away next to the Starbucks, you might not ever notice it (used to be Terra) but it is a little gem! Named after the absolutely gorgeous city in the south of France, Aix en Provence, one of my favorites, I had high hopes for the food but hadn't tried it yet because the previous menu had a lot of cilantro on it. Thankfully I was not disappointed.   Our server was Aaron and he was just about my favorite server I've ever had. He did not steer us wrong. We started with some really interesting craft cocktails we both couldn't get enough of.  We had the heirloom tomato salad on burrata, steak au poivre, and peach clafoutis. The burrata was actually quite mild and not as gamey as some Italian burrata can be. The \"au poivre\" sauce was a perfect accompaniment to the expertly seasoned steak. It was a solid 5 star meal all the way around. Just delicious flavors at every turn. Hubs had the smoked salmon tartine (on a baguette), duck cassoulet and chocolate ganache. It was delicious, decadent and satisfying. Through the evening, Aaron was friendly, attentive and gave us great suggestions. The interior left a lot to be desired (it was generic restaurant furniture with a few paintings of Provence) but the food and service definitely made up for it.   We look forward to returning and when the weather cools off having wine and dinner on the front patio!"}
{"text":"We celebrated a special occasion here recently for our first visit here, and the service didn't disappoint. I don't think I've ever given a 5-star review where I didn't think the food was spot-on superior, until now. What impressed me about Aix en Provence was the service. The hostess was extremely caring, even calling me back on the phone a few minutes later after our dropped phone call, and was extremely courteous. Server was very kind and knew the menu. We ordered a tagliatelle with lamb, which was cooked al dente and flavorful, but perhaps not exactly my flavor palette. She had the seafood soup, which was great and the highlight of our dinner. I had the steak/fries, which was very average and frankly not recommended for $30. We had a small cake with apple compote which they were so kind as to comp for our celebration. And to top it off they even gave us a congratulatory card. They made our night feel very special. We'll certainly remember this. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Expected better.... not great not bad..  Boulliabassie was not right... more like seafood on top of a smear of Lobster Bisque.... so dry we asked for more soup.   Did not appear to bother them much either that we had a valid complaint....    The Chocolate Souffle however was exceptional... maybe next time just for dessert ...    Hope they get  a grip .... could be so much more ..."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places when I want to eat well, plus they are one of the few top restaurants that serve lunch.  Last week at dinner instead of ordering one of my standards I thought I would have their rack of lamb. It was one of the best pieces of meat I had all year, in fact the only place in Charlotte whose meat was as good was Capital Grill and I prefer the service at Aix. When you are in the mood for a great piece of meat think out of the box and have dinner at Aix instead of your normal steak house."}
{"text":"Great all around experience!  Wife and I shared foie gras, burata/tomatoes, Duck confit, pheasant, and chocolate soufflé... All very tasty.   Server very pleasant and recommended great wines to complement dishes.   In spirit that true perfection is unattainable, house cocktail that I had was mix of goose/chambord/pineapple which I would not order again but all in all did not detract from the evening in the slightest."}
{"text":"Date night with the wife and chose Aix based on several articles and recommendations.  Good News is that they were all accurate as Aix is the best restaurant in Charlotte that I have been to in the last 3 years. Bad news is that Aix is not closer to our home and I cannot enjoy their food as often.    Started with a nice bottle of Bordeaux and the Charcuterie platter which featured a nice portion of pate, salami, and Prosciutto.  The best $17 you can spend in Charlotte I promise you that! We debated the menu offerings and settled on Risotto, and Bouillabaisse. Lets start with the Risotto, a creamy blend of Arborio and mushrooms which was decadently rich and perfectly cooked. The Bouillabaisse was prepared with a lobster broth to which I detected a hint of fennel and topped with mussels, clams, scallop and a perfectly pan seared filet of Corvina (drum fish).  All of the restaurant guest stared as I turned up my bowl to slurp the final drops of that broth and licked my bowl clean, well I wanted to do that but reconsidered.  During our meal we were asked if we would like to order the dark chocolate souffle for dessert as it takes 15 minutes to prepare. Wife'e eyes sparkled at the mention of Dark Chocolate so I knew the short answer was yes, order the souffle don't even ask how much it will cost just bring it on.    Cant wait to return to Aix En Provence.  Food: 5 Sporks Service:  5 Sporks Atmosphere: 4 Sporks  Local Beer: 2 Sporks Value: 3 Sporks"}
{"text":"I thought the food was too over priced for the quality. I think the French restaurant, Lumier, has better atmosphere, better food, and better service. The salmon at Aix en Provence was still good, but the creme brûlée and the French fries that accompanied the mussels, and the bread were only alright. I gave this restaurant a harsh rating for the price and because it already has a good rating on yelp that gave us a false expectation of the quality."}
{"text":"We moved to Charlotte 4 years ago from France and finally found the perfect French restaurant.  The ambience, the food, the service is top!  We feel at home at this outstanding French establishment!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great time and enjoyed amazing food.  We split one appetizer which was a shrimp and seafood dish.  Then we split a pasta entrée which was tagliatelle with lamb Ragu and was suggested to us by our helpful and cheery server.  We each then had our own entrées. I had the paella and my wife had the duck and sausage cassoulet.  For dessert we split the chocolate soufflé.  I cannot emphasize enough how great all of the courses tasted.  The starters and pasta dishes are small enough that you can split them and enjoy an entree.   I had a specialty drink, the Le Boulevardier and it was great.  Then switched to an old fashioned and it was not that good but it was the only issue we had.  It was busy even at 10:00pm which was great to see.  Don't miss trying this place."}
{"text":"Merci Bryan St Clair, Hannah, staff and entertainment for a lovely birthday celebration for my better half, Frank.  The food was excellent, the service was beyond gracious and fun, the music was so apropos, the dessert....decadent.    We look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Spectacular food in an unassuming location. Not only was everything we ate amazing, but it was refreshing to receive such great service -- little things like pacing the main course a bit later if you're still working on appetizers can be hard to find these days. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great meal and relaxing evening."}
{"text":"Love the environment. Definitely a hidden gem on Providence Rd. I had the lamb and my fiancé got the duck. Both were phenomenal. We tried escargot for the first time and it was good. We probably would order the mussels as an appetizer next time. All of our cocktails were great as well. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"For my first time there I truly enjoyed the food and service,wishing the best to this only true French restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Charlotte. It's a bit of a secret and it's hidden away but I'd you want to enjoy a wonderful dinner with Mediterranean accents, definitely make a reservation here. The wine selection is amazing, the entrees are varied and interesting and the main meals are incroyable. I fully recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night on a date night. I was excited to go to a French restaurant after all these years.  The food, service and ambience were excellent.  Our server Paula (?) knew the menu and wine list inside and out and helped to create a perfect date night.  The food reminded me of many small local restaurants up and down the Rhône valley in Provence.  Well balanced cuisine is the main theme of French food.  We had grilled Octopus, escargot and foie gras to start. The escargot is cooked with a delicious flakey small pastry that well balanced the earthy taste of the snails. The foie gras was creamy and smooth with a raspberry compote that perfectly paired with the foie gras. Did I mention the Sautern wine that came with the foie gras...delicious.  The grilled octopus was paired with a nice amount of paella-like rice.  On to the main course. We ordered the Bouillabaisse and Cassoulet. We wanted to split both and our server accommodated us by sending us the Bouillabaisse first. You could taste the sea in the broth and the seafood was a nice mix of mussels, small clams and a white fish with a crispy crust that was moist and tender underneath.  You feel like you're in Marseille while eating this.  Oh Cassoulet! How I love you. This epic French farmer dish was lovingly done. The beauty of French food is they take heavy ingredients like beans, lardon (pork belly), sausage and duck and some how balance them into a not heavy tasting experience. This restaurant nails it!  We finished up with an incredible cheese plate that we consumed rather quickly. Small amounts of strong tasting fromage. Oh yeah, it was good.  Anyway, I highly recommend Aix. It's legit. Note, the two bottles of Chateau Neuf de Pape may have biased my experience. But that is the point, isn't it, after all?"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our 52nd wedding anniversary dinner here. We enjoyed the escargot and charcuterie as appetizers and bouillabaisse and duck confit as entrees. chocolate soufflé for dessert. Excellent food, attentive and friendly service. We will go back!"}
{"text":"I ate at Aix the other day with my dad and it was one of, if not the best restaurants I've been to in Charlotte. Literally, it was SO good. We were first brought an amuse bouche of Duck Rillette; it was the perfect little bite. My dad and I split the Escargot for an appetizer (both our first times having it) and they were superb. I would most definitely order them again. We ordered a red wine from Burgundy, France that was really good. I believe it was number B15 (very easily labeled because their wine list is so extensive!!) Paula, our waitress, was wonderful and was very knowledgeable of the menu items! I ordered the Lamb Tagine and my dad ordered the Bouillabaisse. So good. The lamb was absolutely amazing, literally fall off the bone, and my dad said his bouillabaisse was the best he's ever had. I wish I took pictures but I was too busy eating everything. For dessert we had their Chocolate Soufflé and the Paris-Brest. So good, and the perfect finish to the evening. I have to say, the kitchen staff really knows what they're doing here; my next stop is going to be their other restaurant in Waxhaw."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I lived in France for two years and I'm a self-proclaimed food snob. So please take my recommendation as you will.   I went for a family dinner on a normal Saturday night. The restaurant is located in a very unpretentious location next to a Starbucks. So my family likes to try everything on the menu... and the general consensus was that the portions were too small, not much value there... but the disappointing part was the execution was not as to be desired. The foie gras had good flavor, but it was literally a spoonful... not enough to share. The classic moules were good, but again the portion was too small for my taste. The best appetizer we had was the daily special which was sweetbread with a sweet chutney.   The tagliatelle was good, but I didn't get a lot of the Moroccan flavors as I was expecting. The roasted corvina was nothing out of the ordinary. The best entree we had for the evening was the cassoulet. I honestly felt like I was in the French alps having the dish... warm, full of flavor and well executed - I wish they had a little more garlic sausage to go around.   The service, as expected, was very good and the desserts were ok.... they do have a chocolate soufflé which was decent - make sure to order it 20 mins in advance.   I also have to say the patrons were not very diverse, I felt a little weird. Maybe it was just that day..."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect!  I took my wife here for our anniversary last night and everything was exceptional! We have been here 4 different times and the food, service, and atmosphere are great. They even had a bouquet of roses for my wife that were brought to the table by the manager after our main meals.... made my wife a little tear eyed.   HIGHLY recommend for an awesome date night.   -Sean B"}
{"text":"Went for the restaurant week. Lovely food, good service, great wine. The butter they served was so creamy. Had the sword fish which was delicious."}
{"text":"SIX STARS - SUPERIOR. Last night we celebrated a birthday and I am so glad we chose Aix en Provence. This restaurant is first class in all respects from service to food. When we were seated, our server came with a bottle of (very nice) champagne and each of us were poured a glass in celebration of the birthday honoree. In addition, a birthday card signed by all the staff was waiting on our table. That was such a nice beginning to our evening.  The menu consists of small plates, pasta and risotto offerings and regular size entrees. Some plates vary daily such as the charcuterie platter and foie gras. I chose the butternut squash and ham hock agnolotti that was wonderfully light and flavorful along with the butter lettuce salad. My dining companions started with the Oeuf Norwegian which is smoked salmon wrapped around a poached egg. Beautiful presentation and very delicious. They then shared two entrees: the braised lamb tagliatelle and the duck comfit Cassoulet Campagnard. Both dishes got rave reviews.   From a service standpoint, all went quite well. Our server was informative without being pushy. He was easy going yet very attentive. His wine recommendations were very much in keeping with how we described our tastes. When he brought our dessert choice, he included a small birthday candle. The candle didn't cooperate so he left the dessert but took the candle back to the kitchen only to bring the lit candle back in a small dish for the birthday honoree.  Our evening was enhanced by a visit from Chef Owner Nicholas Tarnate. We were glad we could let him know how nice our evening had been. It's really the small things that make dining an event. Aix en Provence pays close attention to all details and especially to the small things."}
{"text":"Best food we've had in charlotte in 6 years. Amuse bouche through dessert. Diverse and interesting wine list. Excellent service. Frisée salad with perfect lardons and egg, octopus, charcuterie, foie. Cassoulet. Beans perfectly underseasoned to make a perfect bite with salty sausage or duck confit. Soufflé mousse. Tarte tatin properly caramelized like in the Loire. Give it a go..."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally went for my first service was impeccable. My husband ordered the bouillabaisse and I ordered the lamb tagine and we both shared the mussels appetizer. The lamb was to die for, so tender and the meat was falling off the bone. The mussels were just as good and goodness that broth!! We could drink it by itself. We've definitely had better bouillabaisse before but this was still so fresh and the mahi-mahi was splendidly done. Thank you Aix en Provence for making me feel so special on my birthday!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Very good place for special occasions like birthdays or anniversaries. Highly recommend the chocolate soufflé and duck."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The food was amazing, the wine recommendations were outstanding, and it's literally the best service I've ever had in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Restaurant week... The good, The better, the best!  I think they did a great job with editing the normal menu.  Excellent service and engagement from everyone! Ann at the bar was very helpful.    Intimate dining with good choices.  Good winemaster"}
{"text":"Phenomenal dining experience from beginning to end.  To start, I found the waitress to be warm and welcoming, knowledgeable about the menu, and willing to make honest recommendations about what to order.  The house bread and butter were quite tasty--nothing that would blow you away, but certainly enough of a cut above the usual to grab your attention.  We ordered the escargot to start. They were, in short, lovely--tender, juicy, and all-around delicious. The pastry that sat atop them was a nice touch--I liked how the escargot and pastry melded with one another, a kind of thoughtful experiment in mixing wet and dry substances.  For the entree, I ordered the cassoulet. It proved to be the highlight of my evening. The lardons, juicy and flavorful, stood out most, although the duck confit was a close second.  All in all, I found the portions to be perfect in size. Between the house bread, the shared appetizer for two, and the cassoulet, I felt neither like I'd overeaten nor like dessert was necessary.   I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is even considering dropping by."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing.  Service is wonderful, and the food was delicious.  The experience of fine dining in a very comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Blown away by the food! This is a great gem in Charlotte. Creative menu that's always changing and a stellar wine list. Service was perfect!"}
{"text":"2.13.2018 - My wife and I had our first occasion at Aix and it didn't disappoint. Fantastic service accompanied by delicious food. The tagliatelle was perfection. Most importantly, on my wife's birthday she felt cozy, comfortable, and cared for. Which, in my opinion, is as good as you can get. From our server Paula offering us a glass of champagne to celebrate when seated, then taking the time to decant our wine, and covertly speaking with Lee Ann at Stagioni to provide us with a chocolate souffle and porto to cap off the evening. It was memorable and we can't wait to return soon."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I lived in France for 6 years, so I'm always a bit skeptical of \"authentic\" French cuisine in the US. However, the food here is so true to its roots that it will remind you of your favorite bistro in Paris!   We've been here several times and never had a dish that wasn't AMAZING! I always get the daily Foie Gras appetizer which never disappoints. In addition to the stellar food, the service is superior. During our New Year's Eve dinner, each of the waiters we've had in the past year stopped by our table to say hello and wish us a happy new year. Really great people!"}
{"text":"Knowing I am a foodie, someone gave me a gift certificate to Aix on Provence for Christmas so I was excited to finally get there this week. Not knowing a lot about French cuisine I was really curious to see what the restaurant was about. Tucked away next to a Starbucks near the Harris Teeter on Providence Road is this tiny bistro, nondescript outside, a veritable passport to France once inside. Parking is scarce but you can always park at the Starbucks as that one closes at about dinner time. I sat in the bar within earshot of a French man singing and playing keyboards as entertainment for the evening. I ordered a lovely charcuterie plate as an appetizer which was excellent and a main course of beouf and pommes frites (hanger steak and French fries). Everything was excellent and the waitress was very attentive. The restaurant was sort of slow that night, but fantastic nonetheless. I am definitely going to go back soon and try some of the other dishes."}
