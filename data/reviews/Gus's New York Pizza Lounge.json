{"text":"Just tried to order the same takeout order I've had on 3 prior occasions, this time a \"Jessica\" answered the phone & seemed  oblivious. She did not know that there is a \" Gus special\" pizza and that they carried a baked wings on their menu.  I had to repeat myself three times for her to understand my order, I asked for the manager and she told me that he will be back and he never took my call.   Next time I'll try Don's New York pizza which is right across the street, I read that they have great customer service."}
{"text":"Horrible! Horrible service! Not that busy and have waited over 20 minutes for a pitcher of beer. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here twice, and I must say, the service has improved. Food is good. Had pizza, wings and cheese sticks. The manager came up to me and asked for suggestions on how to make my experience better. I let him know my suggestions and he took them into consideration. Will return soon."}
{"text":"New place..just dropped by on a Fri night..not too busy but seems cool. Bartenders are nice. We will be back."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place tonight and we were very disappointed. The food was very bland and had no flavor and the service was so terrible. When it was time to pay, their system wouldn't run debit cards (icing on the cake)"}
{"text":"I went in for the all you can eat salad, soup and pizza for $7.99. Sounds great, right? Well, it was not at all what I was hoping. First should have know when there was no one in there. Salad fixin's were wilted and obviously sitting there all day. The soup that I tried was all watery and not tasty at all. Pizza was reheated when we got there and all greasy and floppy. I told my wife, Let's get out of here. we didn't even eat because it was that gross. Then they offered to call the cops on us for not wanting to pay for that garbage."}
{"text":"Fast servers, loud music, lots of TVs. All the essentials of a place to accidentally spend way more time than intended."}
{"text":"It is great to see a genuine pizza and wings spot that has a full quality bar in Peoria instead of driving across creation to to get to one. Had the toasted Italian with the antipasto salad and it was great! Plus Christian the server is awesome! He treated my wife and I like royalty.   Overall, I think this is a place my wife and I will frequent more often for the atmosphere and the level of service you receive when you walk through the door."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great food and good service! I would recommend. Lots of space to party too"}
{"text":"Just reserved  a table of six food first then our famous karaoke  contest win  designer  shoes and a gift card for food. Hurry in designer  shoes and Gift  card contest Thursday's  and  sundays start sign up at 8pm"}
{"text":"I sure hope they get the customer service in order or unfortunately they wont be in business for very long. Being a business owner myself, Mediocre customer service in this day and age is not going to work . My son took a bunch of his friends  the other night per my recommendation and the service was horrible again. It is sad because it is a really cool place and the area is in need of a place like this."}
{"text":"Had the pizza and it was great.  I like this pizza over the other place just to the south."}
{"text":"Took roughly twenty minutes to get a waitress in an empty house. Probably twenty minutes on top of that to get our drinks. Then another fifteen after we finished them before she came back so we could order more, but we couldn't order happy hour at that point as we put in the order about 3 minutes late."}
{"text":"Food is great but service could use some experience. Got seated and wasn't asked what we wanted to drink. When the server came over it was \"are you guys ready to order, or no?\"  We ordered two slices of cheese pizza, two salads and six wings. Pizza came out first followed shortly by one of the salads, a few minutes later the other and finished with the wings. Ummm...ok??? We had to ask for silverware and ice for the iced tea that had none. Not baby friendly, no changing table.Moral of the story, call it on and order it to go."}
{"text":"The pizza was great.  The service was awesome.  I will definitely recommend this place for anybody looking for a sit in pizza place and drinks."}
{"text":"Really good food but awful service. I have been coming here since it opened, but the service has never matched the level of the food."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with friends and family and I wasn't disappointed. They brought out the largest pizza I have ever seen and it was delicious. Antipasto salad was huge and very tasty. Enjoyed the karaoke we all had a blast. Everyone was so friendly. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I ordered online for delivery, it was enough food for two people! They got here at exactly the time they said they would, food still hot and liter of soda still cold! The garlic twists were better than anticipated, most places have more pretzel bite-like \"garlic knots\" but this place was on point."}
{"text":"Place is great, first time here. Pizza was really good was a little dead as far as patrons go but to be fair not very many people are aware it's tucked in here. I will makes this my regular spot for sure."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and have always enjoyed the food and service.  Very generous portions and staff is friendly.  Nice outdoor patio with tv's and misters.  Good neighborhood hang out."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The atmosphere is classy and high end.  Their offerings hit all of my favorites including some great beers on tap.  The pizza was very tasty with a light crisp crust.  I'm excited that their is a new establishment near my house that stays open until midnight week days and until 2 am u on weekends"}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time on Saturday (UFC fight night). The food reasonably priced and quality was okay. We had the Philly cheesesteak and wings. I thought the fries that came with the Philly cheesesteak were so delicious!! Next time I'll try the pizza!   Atmosphere was great. It was a good place to be watch the UFC fights. We went in and got a table right away and there was no cover charge. TV's were kinda small but that's not the worse thing.   All the workers were friendly and tried hard to make the customers happy. Our service was alright. It could have been better but I understand that it was fight night and our server was new. I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Walked into this place at 3:40PM on Sunday May 6th, 2018. Was greeted immediately by the bartender and asked what we would like to drink, we ordered our food at 3:47PM. We ordered a small 12\" Sausage and Pepperoni Pizza and Spaghetti and Meatballs. There was less than 10 patrons in the bar and we did not get our food until 4:27PM. Really, really, 40 minute ticket times when nobody is in your establishment. You should be embarrassed of yourselves. Your only saving grace was your bartender. We are in this area 4 days a week and because of this experience we will never step foot in this place again."}
{"text":"They are getting there. New waitress named Iris was very attentive and sweet. Manager must have read some of the yelp reviews because he was checking on the tables a lot more. 3 waitresses on a Friday night is much better than before. Wings and pizza were great and they had Tuaca tonight!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Not amazing, not horrible. Been here when they opened, in-between, and today.  One constant is poor service. Wait times for drinks and food, and generally waiting to be seen in the first place, is just far too long. Shouldn't be a two hour ordeal to have a pizza, wings, and a couple of beers."}
{"text":"Worst experience, only 6 people in the whole place! Ordered took 40 minutes. Then half our food came out when we were almost done then my son got his pizza. Was crispy on the edge and soggy in the middle! Was very greasy! Manager wondered around!! Didn't come over and ask if everything was okay, even tho I had to ask where my sons pizza was!   Wish it was better hate to see business fail!"}
{"text":"We ordered the giant, wings, salad and drinks. 45 minutes later our Pizza came out and it was burnt. The server was awesome through the troubles. Server said the manager would be out. Never saw him and we had no issues paying full bill, but the fact we were here for over 2 hours and manager never came out really upset us. We finally went to the front to request manager. He came out and all he said was the word sorry!! We told him that it was very unprofessional that he sent the waitress to do his dirty work!! We told him that we didn't have a problem paying the entire bill, but do to the very poor customer service we asked he remove the the pizza we had to reorder. He said that he can't because it would have to come out of his pocket. Poor management!!!! Customer service is everything in any business.  P.S. server was great and on point!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place. Super awesome atmosphere, and the best pizza! Bar is great, happy hour and lunch specials are a bargain. Outside patio is beautiful with lights, TVs, and even a water feature. I come here as much as I can!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  This is the second time we have been here and this will be the last.  I brought my family of 4 here on a Friday night.  Looked good and enjoyable since they had karaoke going on too and they let kids sing.  Pretty cool.  Until it came to the service... :/.  We ordered 12 wings, a large pizza, 2 sodas and a pitcher of beer.  The wings came out first.  5 minutes later the beer came.  We had to go up and ask for the sodas for my kids.  Hey, no problem here they looked to be at 65% capacity.  Then the sodas, wings and beer were gone and no waitress in sight.  Waited for a while and then just went to the bar for more beer and the wife went back up to the service station to get more sodas.  So yes we never had even a refill from the waitress.  So an hour passes by and we ask the waitress if she can let us know when the pizza might be ready.  She can mess back 10min later and let's us know that they gave our pizza to someone else, but they are putting ours in now.  We approach the hour and thirty min mark and still no pizza.  We ask the manager to please just give us our tab and we will leave.  He won't give us our tab, he does offer us a basket of wings.  We ask for the tab again and just say we are ready to go.  We have young kids and can't wait till 10pm for food.  What is bad is that the food did look good...we just never got to eat any of it :("}
{"text":"I've held back thinking our first visit was a fluke. Our first visit included a decent pizza and a very inept server. I would give the pizza a 6/10 but the 40 minute wait (in a uncrowded restaurant) till served was inexcusable; so much as the manager apologized and offered us a discount. While there, another customer told us how great the Philly steak sandwiches were. So, second visit was for the Phillies. Being from the Philadelphia area, I do know what makes a good Philly cheese steak. This wasn't it. Very bland with tasteless cheese melted on top. The only part of the sandwich with any flavor was the diced green bell pepper. It did come with greasy but tasty battered french fries and since the server told us we could have a choice of onion rings, we did one of those. What she didn't tell us was the extra charge when the guest check arrived. In her defense, she did come to the table a few minutes after the food was served to ask if we would like or guest check at that time. Nice atmosphere but that isn't quite enough. There are better venues with better food and better service. In our book, we are 0-2 at Gus's. Game over."}
{"text":"So happy this place finally opened! Happy to have a pizza and wings spot nearby that has a full bar where we can relax and watch sports games! Our server was excellent, friendly and attentive and gladly provided recommendations when asked.  We had the mango habanero wings and the sauce was so delicious! My only complaint was the pizza was a bit soggy in the middle so we'll definitely order it well-done next time, but the crust itself is INSANELY good! Crispy and airy!   The place just opened this week so the patio is still unfurnished, but hopefully when the weather warms up if they get some TVs out there, it'd be a great place to hang out and watch sports.  Will definitely recommend this place and hopefully it'll develop a following and become a neighborhood staple!"}
{"text":"So glad we finally went here. Close to home but never tried them. Only had cocktails today but checked out the menu and will be back for food. Lots of choices and what we saw coming out of the kitchen looked good. Breezy today so stayed inside but patio looked awesome. Will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty sh*tty service. Our host called days before to ask if the location had karaoke and was told yes. The day of, she stopped by and mentioned a large group was going to be here. We were a fairly large group but the entire place was relatively empty with only about 8-10 other people. The waitress was incredibly overwhelmed by our group and stumbled around. She was completely unprofessional when a couple of folks asked for specific items.   Come here for drinks, not food or service."}
{"text":"Best place for families and friends good food  beautiful bar and so on...."}
{"text":"Excellent antipasto salad lettuce,cabbage topped with black olives and full of ham, turkey, salami and pepperoni and mozzarella. Your choice of dressing. Very tasty! I will be back for the all beef meatballs and spaghetti, yum!"}
{"text":"We had an issue where we ordered pizza, they called us to tell us it was ready, and when we arrived to pick it up they had lost our order. Upon requesting our order the staff denied they had ever received a call. At first they blamed other staff and then just flat out denied they ever got the order, going so far as to say we ordered it from a different Gus's. Finally as we were about to leave a man ran out of the back and said that he had taken the order from his office.   Losing orders happens- there is no issue with that. The issue is simply the way they treated us as if we were stupid and had not ordered from their location. I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"This is my go to local establishment for some wings and a beer. All 3 Sams are nice guys. Bar mngr Sam strives to make sure you're a repeat customer."}
{"text":"My family loves pizza, and this place is just down the street so we decided to try it for lunch today. Pros: The pizza was good. We ordered a medium Greek Freak, the crust was crispy, and their medium is more of a large. Cons: The service was really slow. There were only a couple tables other than us, and the waitress kept disappearing in the back. Now the biggie. The wings gave us food poisoning. We have been sick all afternoon, throwing up and diherrea.  So I would say avoid the wings, if not the entire restaurant. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Pizza was good! Service is aweful, poorly trained wait staff who forgets about the customer. Not a busy night at all. Their focus is clearly the bar patrons. Will probably pass next go around."}
{"text":"2nd time here, horrible service.  Disgusting pizza.  Only good person there with a personality is Christian?  Fluffy hair?"}
{"text":"Paper plates.  Took 10 minutes to get a pitcher of beer even though it's dead.  When we ordered the pitcher, the waitress asked what size, not used to that I asked what sizes they had, she said small and large. ???  We chose the large.  It looks like a standard size pitcher, but we can't really tell since we received two different size glasses.  Also I get it's a Thursday and I get it's not a busy night, bit there is a very clear divide between the regulars at the bar and us at the tables and the service we are receiving.  Bathrooms are reasonably maintained.  Zucchini is coins not spears.  When outlet pizza came there was a very long black hair, and we had to request another.  They made us another pizza and it was good, but when the server came to give us our check she said there wasn't a manager around to ask for a discount.  We didn't expect a discount, but the fact that she brought attention to it was weird."}
{"text":"Sam is thee absolute best! I have never been to a pizza place that provides excellent customer service and great food! The wings, pasta, pizza and fries are everything! The drink prices are great, oh and the Guz's salad is excellent! I love this place!"}
{"text":"The Manager and managment is bad ,, very bad The Girls that work there get treated like shit. The wait time for food is bad and the same thing with the bar. The place needs new owner. The owner does not like to take responsibility for him owning the place. Think twice before you go there. It use to bea nice bar and place I have very little for the manger Sam and His managment Skils. The food is only good when Sam the old man cook is cooking other wide don't buy it ,, cuse it not the same. Bad Bad Bad poor need I say more. They also have Fire all the good help as in waitress and bartenders. The help behind the bar Name Jewls ,, hmm she over charges and rips Customers off and charges them twice ."}
{"text":"After my daughter's basketball game from GCU.  My baby came from Seattle U.  We took the family to eat here at Gus Pizza.  The best service ever, thanks to Mary, gave us great service, patience and awesome!  I recommend this place, pizza are huge and wings are the best ever.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty cool, and pizza places that aren't the three large national chains are always interesting to check out. It's like a weird lottery of quality, and something to keep in mind when you approach one of the copious strip mall pizza places in metro Phoenix. Gus's isn't something that will rise to the top of the 'must try' list.  My biggest problem with this place is not that it's overtly bad, it's just largely underwhelming. The only thing I knew about this place going in was that they had some abnormally large pizza for bigger groups; no other context for Gus's was given. What they have is a pretty standard selection of pizza, wings, sandwiches, pasta, etc. that you're going to find at similar establishments. The wings weren't bad, but it's a really simple thing to not mess up so I can't award bonus points based on that. As for their pizza, I can tell that they use quality cheese. My problem is how that's just about all I could taste. The pizza sauce didn't have a distinct enough flavor for me, and I couldn't really distinguish either the sausage or pepperoni on it. The crust was largely tasteless too, which was a pretty big disappointment. It's far from the worst pizza I've ever had, but it just doesn't all come together.  On the service front, I was rather underwhelmed. To be fair, we had a table of 15 or so, and there was only one server on the floor at the time. We ran out of paper plates pretty quickly, and tried to get more and we couldn't find our server for a minute. What makes this even more perplexing is that other than a few patrons at the bar, we were the only table. I don't expect our server to be omnipresent, but I feel like they weren't around as frequently as they should have been given how few people were there. It's just another aspect of this place that adds up to disappointment.  If you want pizza from Gus's, probably get it to go or delivered. It may be a better experience than dining in. If you don't live in the immediate area, you probably have better options and it's really not worth a drive to seek this place out."}
{"text":"Just went to eat at Gus' with my girlfriend. Place was empty except for one guy at the bar and one mom and two girls at a table. Do you think the bartender could be troubled to greet us? No, of course not. Do you think the waitress, who has no other table but the mom and two kids (who were done eating btw), could trouble herself to come take our order? Perish the thought. She was too busy talking on the phone to a friend and stepping outside for a smoke. So we left and went across the street to Don's, where we were promptly greeted and served. Never going to Gus' again."}
{"text":"This is the worst run business I have ever experienced. 1. Only 1 server,whom is also the cashier. 2. Buffet pizza and salad bar are neglected. 3. Server- rolled his eyes and huffed when we made order. Poor attitude and unprofessional  Too bad I really hate to tell friends and even five it 1star. It is disappointing, and p.s. this is my first post ever but I had to let others know"}
{"text":"Extremely satisfied!!! Both the pizza and the calzone were delicious! Ryan is a great server too! Their music rocks!!! Definitely coming back..."}
{"text":"Worst Philly cheesesteak ever.  No meat flavor at all.  Too many other seasonings covering up the taste  Boneless chicken wings are in the shape of balls. Very greasy and burned  Will not order from this place again"}
{"text":"Don't recommend pizza is nothing like New York. The cheese seems fake and the dough was terrible. The wings are ok. A little expensive for what it it's, I won't be back. Don't play the arcades the keep your money.The waitress was nice."}
{"text":"I ordered the sampler platter. Did not receive onion rings, instead they gave me curly fries (didn't ask on the phone, they just substituted on their own) and did not receive the fried zucchini so they came back and gave us a full size.  I also ordered fettuccine chicken alfredo. it was a good sized for $10. It came kinda bland and runny. Chicken was good though but I had to put in my own seasonings so the pasta wasn't tasteless. Like I said the sauce was also runny. Pretty much was like a frozen dinner pasta until I fixed it up myself. I also did not receive the bread that comes with the pasta.  Overall wasn't authentic tasting at all.   I don't know if these employees are clueless or don't care? If you're out of a specific ingredient maybe you should tell your customer over the phone while ordering. Communication."}
{"text":"I went on Sunday and I guess a waitress called in sick. It took a long time to get service and food was fair. I felt bad for our waiter who told us up front what was going on. I wanted to leave by sister insisted on staying. I will not be going bAck."}
{"text":"Chris is an amazing bartender. Mary not so much. Food is good and the atmosphere as is as well.... until Mary takes over the bar. If you want a successful bar don't chase out all the females/ local patrons."}
{"text":"I went to Gus's for lunch today. When I walked in at noon, there were literally 4 people in the entire place. I sat at the bar and waited for the bartender to come over to take my order. I sat there for 10 minutes without someone greeting me, asking if I wanted anything or even acknowledging that they had their 5th customer of the day. I watched as the bartender played on their touch screen game. After sitting there for 10 minutes and no one waiting on me, I walked out. I would imagine the bartender had no idea I even walked in cause she was in front of the touch screen game the entire time.  This one will definitely be crossed off the list of possible lunch places. Just terrible. Maybe that is why they only had 4 people in the whole place."}
{"text":"Good food large portions, the only bad part was we specifically asked if we could do the happy hour for appetizers and if we made it in time there server said YES but charged the full price we asked about it when we got our check, then she brought a menu and said show me where is says appetizers are in happy hour. The top of the menu says till 7pm the bottom says 6pm apparently the drinks are until 7 appetizers till 6 but if she would of said that when asked we wouldn't of cared but instead she said yes when asked. Good food but we won't go back because we don't like to be deceived."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, ask for Briana when you come here! Fast service and awesome food"}
{"text":"I went here for a friends birthday party. What a waste of gas and money. Horrible customer service and food. I ordered a Cesar salad it was just generic salad mix with Cesar dressing. I ordered a pepperoni calzone it wasn't good at all. Very greasy, tasteless sauce. I will not be back to any of their locations."}
{"text":"There is no denying that this is great \"really bad\" food. But this is the second time we have ordered from this location. And we are used to the Gus's that is an old town Scottsdale ordering at 2 AM mind you. This location is not open nearly as late but both times are a wait has been ridiculous. This time being middle of the afternoon on a weekend and they told us we should get it sooner than they normally quote. so more than an hour later we are still waiting for our lunch. We even called and they said it would be here in two minutes. Eventually, about an hour & 10 min after calling our food came. Not even warm. It had to have been sitting for the last hour. And if you consider ordering cheese fries, think again. The cheese was hardened on the fries.  There are way more options for pizza & sandwiches to choose from and this is my last time calling them for food"}
{"text":"Not sure what to think, went yesterday about 2 p.m., the place had a couple people sitting at the bar, two other tables just finished up, and the other table was waiting on food. The service sure could use some improvement, very very slow, not very customer friendly at ALL, the smell of baby vomit or sour milk lingered in the area, took to long to get to water downed ice teas with very minimal ice, never once checked on us, glasses sat empty. Did order a pizza and I must admit we did like it, but the service kills it. Hopefully they can hire some people who want to work, and have worked in the restaurant business. Sorry Gus, was hoping you'd be our go to place. One other thing we observed, who ever the man was that was tending bar disappeared for awhile, finally when he showed back around he was holding a tissue up to his nose with one hand and handling the food that was waiting to be sent out, never once did he wash his hands as he walked back over to the bar to serve drinks/food! gross"}
{"text":"Pizza was the goal for the Dad daughter date and after awhile pizza is what we got. Gus's wasn't the first option but I've had Gus's pizza on Thomas and Tempe before so figured couldn't go wrong. My daughter liked the vibe as she has never been but to me typical sports bar...so immediately we put in our order of chili poppers, and medium supreme. After about 25 minutes of waiting the owner questioned if we had been helped...finally the poppers came out and looked delicious, crispy and crunchy outside with a nice cheesey inside. The only thing is the Jalapeño wasn't cooked so you had scissor through it.  The supreme pizza was good, very cheesy not a lot of marinara which was pretty disappointing but good overall. The toppings of bell pepper were pretty heavy which over powered what mushroom and onion were there. A major downer was the fact that a DJ was there, and he wasn't DJ'ing anything. Just letting a house music playlist play the entire time smh felt like I was at a rave. Not to mention the DJ has a poor service dog that had to deal with being 2 feet from speakers bumping which also bothered me"}
{"text":"Gus's has always had great pizza at the other locations that I have been to before and this one is no exception. The difference is this one is a really cool sports type restaurant with a fantastic bar great jukebox really nice decorating and the great service. You have to try this location because it's really great."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! And it's under new management now! The portions are huge and delicious! And the owner was extremely nice and attentive! Come check this place out! I will wed be back!!"}
{"text":"The service was fine. The atmosphere was nice apart from the very early-evening karaoke, which was a bit irritating. The pizza and wings were good. However, my friend and I both ordered the antipasta salad, one large and one small. When the food arrived, the salads looked exactly the same size. All the server could do is tell us it was definitely a small and a large, so I asked to speak to the manager. Manager explained that on the large salad, even though it is the same size bowl, they put more ingredients. The salads looked exactly alike to both my friend and me, apart from the $3 difference in price. In addition, we ordered a large pitcher of beer (48 oz). This pitcher did not look like it was 48 oz. It looked like it was 32 oz. Under the menu description for a large pitcher of beer it notes \"three glasses.\" I did not ask for the pitcher to be measured, but three different people in our party commented on the fact that it did not look like a 48-oz pitcher of beer. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Bummed tonight to bring a friend and enjoy some drinks and food...  Walked through the door at 9:20 p.m...  Was greeted by the waitress and when I asked if it would be OK to sit outside to eat food..  She responded that she didn't know if her kitchen was open because they were going to be closing early.. I told her I'd seen online that they were open til midnight but she responded that there a many Gus locations implying maybe I'd seen the wrong one? I wasn't rude and neither was she but I was def looking forward to a beautiful night on the patio with some food. Guess we went on the wrong Thursday:/"}
{"text":"The service was TERRIBLE! Over an hour without our entrees. Food came out wrong and the waitress argued with us. Manager seemed to be present, but never came over. I feel bad leaving 1 star because the food is good....the only reason we'd come back. We've been here before and had decent service at the bar. DON'T sit in the dining room!"}
{"text":"Late night Pizza stop after Volleyball Tournament, service was great. Garlic Knots were delicious.  The place was open late so we gave it a try.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"this place is terrible. took 45 minutes to get our food and when we did, the wings tasted odd and tremendously salty. the pizza too was overpowered with salt and part of bit wasnt even fully cooked. when asked to tsb out we told the waitress about the issues. she said she would ask her manager about discounting our order. that took 10 minutes itself. definitely not a place we will be returning to. weird menu note: an order of 16 wings cost $16.99. a dozen wing is $8.99 and 1/2 dozen are $4.99. $13.98 if you order this way. so basically $3.00 cheaper for 2 extrea wings."}
{"text":"My first visit to Gus's will not be the last.  The atmosphere is inviting - fun, clean and laid out well.  For cooler weather, there is a nice outdoor patio.  The food was delightful.  It took about one and a half beers to get wings, which was a good sign - fresh made to order.  The sauces were all tasty as well.  The pizza - two thumbs up.  None of this was typical 'bar' food.  It has been a while since I have had pizza that good - you know, that deep, flavorful experience that causes you to pause after every bite?  The service was also spot on.  And when the bill arrived, the gentleman (my apologies for not getting his name) was most accommodating when I expressed concern over the price of our 'domestic' beers, which were advertised as $1.50 during happy hour.  He changed the bill even though our definition of domestic is the same as the dictionary but not the beer purveyors.  He did agree his sign should be changed.  I will most definitely visit Gus's again - there is great beer and many different dishes to try!  See you soon!  (Maybe consider offering a happy hour price on local and other micro brews?!)"}
{"text":"Food is definitely 4 star and service is 2 star so they get 3. Prices are good. 2nd time here. Got different food each time and it was good. Friends all got different stuff and we're happy with their food too. Service is completely ridiculous. Both times we came the service was horrible. Both times were different staff also. Super slow and completely unprofessional. Waitress said \"you guys ready yet or not?\" Mind you, was told from the back to have a seat wherever we wanted when we walked in...not greeted at the front door. No big deal. OK then Waitress comes over and leaves 2 menus and leaves....yeah ill take a drink. Then comes back and says the ready or not. One thing after another. Hopefully the owner checks the reviews and can fix the staff. Little training goes a long ways. Good job on the food though. So...one more thing...as I'm sitting here writing up this review she has came back 3 times for the credit card slip with the tip on it. Really? If she came back that much to see what we wanted or needed she would've nailed it!!!! Please work it out cause we are lacking for good stuff on the west side."}
{"text":"Never going back. Messed up my order, and I had been waiting double the amount of time it was supposed to take. After I specifically told them I ordered pasta. Not a fucking sub. Owner/ manager was rude. All the other employees were very nice."}
{"text":"Second trip to Gus's. If I was to judge them on their service tonight It would be 2 stars. Hopefully this was just a bad night for them. We shall see when I do my next visit.  Food was good. My wife got a calzone and said it was very good. Loaded with cheese and she had meatballs added. Large enough that two could easily had enough to eat. I again got the wings. I ordered hot but was pretty mild in compare to the last visit.  The service was horrible. Waiter forgot we were there and finally realized we were there. We ordered our drinks and then waited forever for them to come. We then ordered and people that came in after us got their food and had almost finished their meal when my wings were delivered but still no calzone. It came in about 10 more minuets. After we had finished and ready for a bill nothing came. Finally I had to get up and find someone so we could leave.  Because of the first experience I am going to give them another chance to get it right. There are a lot of pizza places near us. They have to be much better that this visit to get my business.      I will start with 4 stars but will probably be 5 stars after the next visit if is as good as our first visit was.  It's new and as you would expect everything is fresh and crisp. Lay out is similar to most sports lounges. Plenty of tvs to watch your favorite team play.  Outside s seating is coming soon. Bring your family not just for the sport lounge crowd.  I got their hot wings. I am usually disappointed as the hot wings are not as hot as I wish. Not so here. Their hot wings are hot, just like I wanted them. The plus......there is some extra sauce in the bottom. I like that. My wife got a veggie pizza. She said it was very good. Plenty of cheese and the crust or pizza dough was especially good. Plenty more on the menu. Everyone should be able to find something they like.  The service was great. The manager came out and greater us, tell us what they were planning and invited us back. Great personal touch.  We will most certainly be back soon.  Their challenge will be there are is several pizza places in the area. Getting in and out is easy but they are hard to see.  Forgot to say.......Welcome to the neighborhood."}
