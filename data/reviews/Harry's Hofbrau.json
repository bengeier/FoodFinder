{"text":"Update. Went to the resturant to celebrate my wife's  birthday. The food was good. They had a  a gentleman playing a button
N box it really picked up the celebration 10 knochs. I don't know how often he plays but you will really enjoy the music and food. Have fun"}
{"text":"We love this place.
The food is fun and clearly prepared with love. 
The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming no matter the size of the group.   
We had goulash and and cod. They were exactly what we wanted; homey and filing. 
The pretzels are excellent- don't forget the cheese. 

As for the staff, we love Ginny. She is the perfect waitress - she makes great suggestions,  is attentive, friendly and always had the right wine suggestion. 

Come eat  here,  and bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Went for a weeknight dinner, this was probably the third time there. Not as much fun if the place isn't packed. Two of us had the veal schnitzel. It was fine, though at $17 was not a great value. Not as tender as I would have liked. One of us had the chicken paprikas, and this was also fine though the gravy had a bit more tomato flavor than you'd expect.

So not a place I'm dying to go back to but they do Eastern European pretty well."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. I can't rate the food because I never got to eat what I ordered. I was with a party of 8 with a reservation for 7 PM. We finally got our food at 8:42 PM and when we asked for and update at 8:30 PM we were told the server \"thought it would be up soon.\" After waiting another 10 minutes we asked for another update and more silverware. The server brought out more silverware and as she set it down she said, \"I don't have time to pass this out because your food is coming up.\" 
Our food came out in shifts, the last person getting their order at 8:59 PM.

When we talked with who we thought was the owner/ manager, she told us the ticket had only gone through 23 minutes prior to us getting our food. We found that interesting considering we had given our server our order at least 45-50 minutes before that, but when we communicated that to this owner/ manager she responded by making excuses. That's right, no apology.  

As our food was still not coming out or items were missing we again expressed our disappointment and this time the owner/ manager responded by saying, \"You know what? We're not good enough for you.\" And then as the conversation progressed she told us she quit and was no longer the manager and then went to another area of the restaurant (where our table as well as other customers could still see her) and sat down on the floor and started crying. 

I never got to eat my food because by the time I got it, my infant was done being patient and really I don't blame her. Not only was the service the slowest I've ever experienced but the management team was completely unapologetic and then down right rude. My family visits different restaurants in the area every Friday evening. Needless to say, we will not be dining here again. I suggest if you do that you have a snack before you leave the house!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our whole experience! The wait was about 20 min on a Wednesday evening but it went quickly with good beer & mixed drinks at the bar & a button-box player that was just \"loud\" enough not to drown out conversations!   Wait staff very knowledgeable about menu items. Good food -- definitely homemade & delicious! The schnitzel, beef stroganoff and sides of potato pancakes & cabbage/noodles were wonderful! So glad we shared dessert of German chocolate cake & homemade apple strudel -- all 4 of us had a perfect taste. Definitely will return soon!!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times.  I am sad to say I can give this food no better than an 'Okay\".  I would STRONGLY suggest that if these owners want to stay open, they IMMEDIATELY take some lessons in correct preparation of German food and also marketing strategies.  Chicken goulash is a German staple.  This chicken goulash is first WAYYYY overpriced, bland, tasteless and icky.  The chicken appears to have been boiled and has NO flavor.  This sides are small and ridiculously expensive.  The sauerkraut is too salty.  To charge $2 for a side of cheese to go with the microwave pretzel is appauling.  We like to go for the polka bands on Sunday.  It appears the regulars have already figured out the food is mediocre at best and they don't seem to order it.  Hey, if you are a restaurant and want to keep your doors open,  a RAPID restructuring is necessary..like NOW--review how to prepare food,review consistency of meals, review how staff treats customers,  how to price items, how to get customers who actually order food and not just listen to music in the door...or you will have  lot of time on your hands....I say all this to HELP.  hope you listen..."}
{"text":"Disturbed to say the least at how all the food tasted exactly the same.... You could have put a flip flop next to the schnitzel and I would have not  been able to tell the difference.  I went today, it was my first time........It was also my last. 
The only thing worth mentioning was that the beer was good. The beer cheese even better and if I were an author and this was a book that would be the end of it. I was shorted a pretzel and the ones that I did get could have been mistaken for those you find in a Snyders of Berlin bag. 
Ultimately very dissatisfied.  HARD TO BELIEVE that $86 in food can yield such a bad result. My opinion.............stick to hot dogs.
Sorry folks but as a foodie I must tell it like it is. 
This is one house that needs to be evicted! 
Sincerely 
RD"}
{"text":"They have exceptional food and environment. A terrific place to meet friends and enjoy life. High quality food and big portions (the schnitzels are unbelievable) served with a smile. If you like robust, homemade soups, this is your place."}
{"text":"A friend mentioned to me that they'd recently opened, and it was nice to see someone opening up a different ethnic restaurant since it seems that you can't swing a dead cat by it's tail in Mentor without hitting a pizza joint...

I came it at 2000, and there were a few tables seated, but I'd hardly call the place packed. I only saw one waitress handling everyone, but they had no hostess, so I waited to see if anyone was going to take notice or if I aught to just seat myself. She eventually made her way over to me and I opted to sit at the bar.

The barmaid was very friendly, but you could tell that both she and the waitress were obviously over-worked, and the place was understaffed. She mentioned that the restaurant had only just opened up this past March, so I can understand if it might take a little while for it to find it's feet.

I opted for the Haufbrau Dunkel (nothing to write home about), and saw that while they have a reasonable selection of beers, all they had on draft were the Haufbrau brands. You'd be inclined to think that if you were eating in a German restaurant, they might have a good selection of German beers on draft, not just bottles. Frankly, I can get a Sam Adams in a bottle at a convenient store.

The interior is nicely decorated with a lot of Om-pa-pa music playing, and I was told that they have an outdoor Biergarten as well, but I didnt check it out.

Where the place went downhill for me was the food, and moreso what I paid for it:

 If I'm getting a sample plate of their wurst and paying $12 for it, I want more than just 5 or six nubby ends of sausages hidden amongst pickles and half a loaf of bread accompanied by a \"beer\" cheese that tasted like someone added Budweiser to some nacho-cheese spread. The Wurst plate seemed more like the Worst-plate!

The home-made German mustard was exceptional, but it's going to take more than a good condiment to keep this place afloat.

The Kartoffelpuffel (potato pancakes) were sizeable, but very greasy and lacked flavor. All it would have taken was for the cook to let them rest on some paper-towels while covered to get some of the grease out and actually season the potatoes. It just tasted more like a giant McDonalds hash brown to me. 

It's pretty easy to see that this place is going through some growing pains; they seem understaffed, and while some of the food (namely the Wurst) is good, it is overpriced for the quality. 2 Beer and 2 appetizers was $30 out of pocket for me alone! 

 I expected a Haufbrau house, and what I got was a bar that serves overpriced, mediocre German food and beer that I could buy at any local liquor store. In summation, I will say that this place has a lot of potential, and moreso that Mentor needs a good German place, but the management needs to take a hard look at their pricing, plate composition, and elevating their food if they want to draw people in and keep them from just going to Das Schnitzel Haus, or the Haufbrau in downtown Cleveland.

One last criticism: Where are the fucking Germans at anyway? I greeted the barmaid with a Guten Abend she looked at me cross-eyed."}
{"text":"Went to Harry's for dinner and really enjoyed it. Sauerkraut Balls were delicious and the Cabbage Rolls were wonderful too. The apple strudel was great the next day with a cup of coffee.  The portions were plenty and enough to need a to go box! The music was a nice addition. Will return to try Schnitzel Holstein."}
{"text":"The food and beer is good   This was our 2nd time here. The first was shortly after they opened food was good service was horrible way under staffed we were there for almost 3 hours.   This time outstanding service very glad we gave them a 2nd shot. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"I really hope they can work out the problems here because it's great to have a different kind of  restaurant in Mentor. $4 for an obviously frozen pretzel and another  $2.09 for a couple of tablespoons of cheese? ? $15 for fried fish that looks like it came from GFS? Schnitzel good though.  Wait staff friendly but not attentive. And dressed like they just threw on the first white shirt they could find and sloppy blue jeans. I'm not saying they should wear lederhosen but something indicating they work at an ethnic restaurant!  We'll give them another shot and hope they can become what this town needs."}
{"text":"We had dinner here with another couple on a Monday night. There was no hostess or any staff around so we just stood around until finally making eye contact with the bartender. The place was pretty empty with the exception of a group of men throwing frisbees at chains in the corner. This should have been our cue to leave.  Two of us ordered the chicken paprikash and we both had to send it back, which I never ever do.  It was bland, luke warm, the chicken was over cooked and tough and the sauce was watery like soup and the sour cream had separated. 

Our meals were replaced with new orders of sandwiches. Apparently the sandwiches don't come with a side and since we had already eaten our sides since the paprikash was inedible when we got the check we were charged for the paprikash meals instead of our sandwiches. The waitress explained that she was actually doing us a favor because IF she rung up the sandwiches and the sides we had eaten separately it would cost us more. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?! We had to send back our food because it was terrible and you do us the \"favor\" of only charging us for the terrible part? 

My boyfriend and I are in from out of town visiting and were having a lovely time, despite the food, catching up with our friends when one of the camo wearing frisbee throwers very abruptly came to our table to loudly and sternly \"Wish us a Merry Christmas\". It was very clear that that was his way of telling us to get the hell out. We apologized for being disruptive to their evening and left. As we left three other customers were arriving and we advised them that the restaurant was not only serving terrible food but were also uninterested in having any customers there and that they were closed for the evening. 

I look forward to seeing this place close permanently. 

I'm writing this review at 3am because of the stomach pains I'm now having from that \"free\" sausage sandwich. Run don't walk away from this place and it's rude staff."}
{"text":"Wanted to get a gift card for a friend. I got there at 11. Didn't know what time they opened. FYI, they open at 4. Called and spoke to a lovely lady. Didn't get her name, but she opened the door for me, I got my gift card and I was on my way.  Will definitely have to grab a bite to eat there ourselves sometime soon."}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday night..not very busy....onion soup was substandard, not worth 6.20...cheese not melted, not very flavorful. Schnitzel was good, but came with plain mashed potatoes. Mother and Aunt got cabbage rolls, were cold to the touch, and were not cooked on the inside. Owner offered her a $15 gift certificate, but she doesn't want to go back...

Not busy, no hostess...just stood around for 10 minutes trying to catch someone's eye...definitely not worth the price. We love the Hofbrau house in Cleveland and will pay the little extra it costs to go there..it seems that they are trying to pull a fast one on Mentor diners...go downtown and have a great time..."}
{"text":"Growing up in Cleveland, and being of hearty European stock, I know my way around a potato pancake, so when I found out Matchworks Tavern was now Harry's Hofbrau house, I was pretty excited. I ordered wienerschnitzel & potato pancakes. Schnitzel was pounded out, breaded & perfectly fried, not at all chewy like some other places I tried. Potato pancakes were crisp, and perfectly seasoned. Great place with a nice outdoor patio. Good place for family dinner or night out with friends."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped meatloaf was killer. Mashed potatoes had an odd texture but were delicious"}
{"text":"Don't waste time coming here. Walked into an empty restaurant at opening time and was told there was a 30minute wait. Hostess was telling everyone entering that they will only seat one table at a time. Once a table is sat and has ordered then a second table will be sat. Decided to wait it out and watched over 25 people walk out in disgust. Once we were sat they waitress was downright nasty. Prices are high for the food and the food quality low. Out of 4 of us no one liked their meal. No flavor to any of the food. Very disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"Went back again within the last week and they must really listen to their reviews. Food was delicious and piping hot and the service was excellent. Very attentive and friendly. Looking forward to going back again soon!!!"}
{"text":"When I was reading other reviews I was thinking that it cant be that bad...  I don't really know where to start.  I have been going to the Hofbrauhaus in downtown Cleveland since it opened maybe a year ago and that place is truly a great time and this place is nothing even close to it.

Food-
Not only is the food bland it is just like everyone else said extremely overpriced.  I personally got a sausage on a hotdog bun which was average nothing great and a potato pancake which is ehhh.  Everyone else got meals and they all said their food was bland and looking at the portions I don't know how Harry's can justify charging over $10 for a plate, but they do.  

The beer-  
This is my big thing... The beer must be sitting in the kegs for a while or they must not clean their lines because it did not taste that good. I love beer needless to say I only got one beer.  For draft beers they only have 2 or 3 German brews on draft and a decent bottle list, so there is something for everyone.

Service-
Saying service was average would be a complement to them.  It seemed like we had to move at the servers pace and do as she says.  She was not welcoming to us asking a question or requesting a service that might get her out of her routine.

To recap so you can get a idea of what it would cost to eat here cheaply.  I ordered:

1 sausage in a pretzel bun (It was in a regular hotdog bun)
1 Dunkel beer 1/2 stein
1 potato pancake 
Total: $19.98 

My suggestion to anyone thinking of going here would be to drive another 20 miles and get some good German food and beer that tastes fresh at the Hofbrauhaus in Cleveland."}
{"text":"My boyfriend found out about this place and wanted to surprise me for dinner. When we walked in, there was no host or anyone to seat us so we sat at the bar. The server said she wouldn't be and to take our order for at least 25-30 minutes. We finally ordered a pretzel with beer cheese and it was just OK. The chicken dumplings soup was good. We ordered the jagerschnitzel with potato pancakes and I was not impressed. We were the last order they took because they ran out of food. I would not recommend eating here. I'll travel further to get some German food"}
{"text":"Looks like it is closed,
 Fourk is now open there

Too bad but spot keeps changing restaurants
Thanks"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to start this so I guess I'll be nice and start with all things good. Atmosphere, layout, size of the place is nice. It's big enough for what it is. But that's about all I can really say for positives.
We checked this place out last night on a whim and were very disappointed. I ordered soup and salad and he had a bratwurst sandwich. At the time of ordering he asked if he could get a different side with his sandwich becuase he's not a big fan of sauerkraut, the waiter said no there is a $4.09 up charge for fries. (Which if you looked at the side menu...fries were the same price as the kraut so subbing one $4.09 side for another $4.09 side seems reasonable, but I guess not.) Anyway, food came out one at a time, like they forgot to put our whole order in. I couldn't complain about mine, it's pretty hard to mess up soup and salad. His on the other hand he said was dry, so he used some of the 3 mystery mustards on the table to liven it up. Overall we spent $25 for the dinner, not worth it in my opinion for the service we received. We thought about saying something to a manager on the way out but thought we would probably be offered only a gift card to come back, which won't be happening. Sadly, this location has been a few different things over the past few decades and if this place continues with this kind of service it'll be something else soon enough."}
{"text":"Been there twice and would not go back. Soup was barely warm, side dish of noodles weren't buttered and the price is high, given what you get. The beer is great though!"}
{"text":"Nice. Great food and beer. DOG FRIENDLY PATIO!!! Brought our pup water, and he's a 80# Golden! Excellent German and Eastern European foods!"}
{"text":"Don't go!!  Food overpriced service very bad all new workers they didn't even ask us for drink order, and food awful potato pancake raw inside stew had 2 strips of beef paprikish had gravy like a bowl of soup and stuffed cabbage no flavor.  Awful awful food will never go again!!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. We were in town for dog training and it was the only place for miles that allowed a dog so off we went. The beer was good if you like those german beers, and the food was ok. Everything looked really good on menu but tasted pretty much the same when we got it. My kid loved the stroganoff. Three stars for the food plus one more for the dog."}
