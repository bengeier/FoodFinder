{"text":"Excellent service, good food, even better prices. Can't complain! Grab and go or order ahead and pay online. No seating, strictly takeout. But the sushi is fresh, delicious, and well worth it."}
{"text":"Fresh made to order sushi. I was happy to find a decent sushi place close to work. They operate a very small store front for take out orders only. So far everything that I have tried was quite good. Waaay better than any food-court crappy sushi.  Try the salmon sushi lunch combo!"}
{"text":"The best take out sushi spot in the city. Have ordered 10x from Uber eats, will keep ordering. Wellington roll and crazy salmon roll are tops"}
{"text":"What a gem!  Was pleasantly surprised by the good quality upon my first visit.  The quality is notches above \"cafeteria-style\" sushi, and even some popular sushi restaurants up in the Annex.  I would recommend this place to friends / family."}
{"text":"NOOO! I heard they're gonna close down at the end of August :( THIS CAN'T BEEE. Please come back!!"}
{"text":"Man oh man oh man!!!!!!! My husband and I absolutely love sushi. When we knew we were headed to Second City for the night, we tried looking for places to eat around that area. When we saw the incredible reviews for T-Sushi, we knew exactly what we would be having for dinner. This place did not disappoint. You can either go in person or order ahead online. I believe they also do delivery with Uber eats. They have lots of different rolls for incredible prices. The prices range from $2 to about $9 a roll. We ordered the California and Alaska Rolls. I loved that they were packed with ingredients (less rice than I'm used to in terms of proportions, which was great). We also ordered the Crazy Salmon Roll, which comes with spicy salmon, green onion, and avocado. The roll is topped with torch-seared salmon (which is fun to watch the chef do) and Tobiko sauce. It was probably one of the best rolls I have ever eaten and it was only $9. The only \"downside\" is that you can't eat here, but what do I care. I just want great sushi fast, which is what this place does best. We found this place on our second night here and will DEFINITELY be back. As a tip, be careful not to miss this place as it is really tiny. It is right next to a place that sells flowers (which that store typically has a sign about flowers outside) and Blue Jays merchandise."}
{"text":"Just discovered this little place the other day. Great, fresh sushi at a reasonable price!

Sadly, just got a notice that the place is closing at the end of August, which is a shame because this was going to become my go-to place for sushi lunch!"}
{"text":"There's a reason everyone gives this place 5 stars, and it is because of the great value! They have restaurant quality sushi for lower than grocery store prices. This place could raise its prices by 20% and I would still give it 5 stars! All of their sushi was delicious. I loved the torched salmon roll. You're able to watch the chef as he prepares the meal. 

Notes: it is a small shop on the south side of Wellington and easy to miss. This place is take-out or order-out only.

In summary, I went to the aquarium, CN tower, Amsterdam brewery, this sushi place and Second City on Monday.....this was my favorite experience from that day."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and service. I found this place while trying to find lunch options at work. It's a small takeout shop connected to a clothing shop at the bottom of a building. The portions are very generous. Try the salmon lunch special which comes with soup and salad. The crazy sushi and their dragon rolls are delicious as well. Prices are very reasonable and if you pay by cash on orders over $20, you get a 10% discount."}
{"text":"Never reviewed before - or so from the best of my memory but this place definitely deserves it! Awesome takeout joint in city centre, close by my work (financial district) as well as my condo. Still impressed as I was the first time i came here - very fresh and generous portions. Quick and courteous service. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"This little take-away place is awesome !

Came here in the evening expecting to have a nice little sit-down place !  
Unfortunately there are no places to sit.  This is a pure take-away place.  This little place is tiny.  There is basically enough space for a stand-up fridge, the cash counter and the area where the sushi chef works.  

We placed our order and sat and waited.  There were no other orders or people, so while we waited we could see our sushi chef making our rolls. Was very cool to watch the chef working his magic.  

Took this back to our hotel and sat down to a huge surprise.  All the ingredients are very fresh. and very tasty !  All the rolls were delish !!  The price for the rolls was very good value. 

Next time I go, I'll know to order ahead and just grab and go !  This place is a winner !"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. One visit to this place turns me to be a sushi lover. Reasonable price and excellent service. It's more convenient to order online and they will do the delivery. 2.50 off if order online. Incredible delicious. I am planning for another visit soon."}
{"text":"T-Sushi is my go to sushi place! Their sushi is always fresh and they are always very generous with their maki and sashimi sizes! Even though this place is strictly take out only, I would choose it over a sit down sushi restaurant any day! The guys that work there are always so friendly and always have my order ready on time! Will definitely be ordering again... and again!"}
{"text":"A great take out place. Fresh and delicious! Order in advance and pick up ready in 10-15 mins. I had the red dragon roll and the shrimp sushi. Both very good. Highly recommended. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Very yummy. Everything is made to order so everything is fresh. Ginger is non dyed. Wasabi is squeezed fresh from the tube, not left out in the open. Rolls are a good size with great portions of ingredients, with an appropriate portion of rice. I ordered the T roll (with eel and cream cheese galore) and the one with blow torched scallop (full pieces of scallop, not diced - and roasted sesames!!). Very polite staff. Take out and go. No line and took 5mins to make my order, very clean. Will come back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sushi that comes from this shop. It's currently a take out only spot and is shared with some sort of convenience store immediately on the left of the shop. The sushi is very fresh and you can taste that all the ingredients are prepared in the morning. I would say the sushi has restaurant level taste but packed in a to go and convenient method.

The first time I went here I ordered by walk in and ordering a party platter. This was a mistake because everything was made to order so I ended up waiting 15 minutes. What I highly recommend is that  you place a order online and schedule a pick up time. That way you're in and out and good to go.

Last tip - if you pay cash you get a discount, I believe is 10%"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up here on a Friday night and was surprised that it was a little sushi store with only two guys working. The sushi rolls were prepared extremely well, and the portions quite large for the price! Will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Smaller sushi selection but everything I've tried there is just amazing. Great prices. Only took 20 min for our sushi to be ready. I wish there was a restaurant option rather than just take out but that would not stop me from going there again.

Update: just got an email saying they will be closing end of august :("}
{"text":"T-sushi GOAT sushi, get the spicy combo.
Literally went here every week, went there twice in a day"}
{"text":"Tsushi is so mini that you'd for sure miss it walking past. But don't let their small size fool you. This is some of the best sushi I've had in the city! To be honest I've actually never been inside as I always order it online. I'm always beyond satisfied with the quality and it definitely satisfies my sushi craving! They put way more fish than rice and always accommodate my annoying requests :p damn now I'm craving sushi"}
