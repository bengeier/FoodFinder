{"text":"Don't come here .. This place smells bad .. Is cold like the one server they have and the food is awful . You would think that such an awful place would have better drink specials . Don't come ."}
{"text":"For a dive bar it's not too bad. On the nights with a live band you can't even hear yourself think. They do karaoke one day a week and karaoke is really popular right now. The service is off and on. The first time I was there the bartender was almost annoyed anytime I ordered something and was pretty rude too. I think he thought it was funny and endearing but it wasn't. On other nights the service has been quick and even attentive at times. 

As far as food goes they offer the usual pub classics. I tried poutine the first time and for a pub it wasn't bad. It had a healthy amount of gravy which is important to me.... Well I guess I like the gravy more than the fries but one can't just eat gravy and look sane.... Can they? :) they also offer a wall of flavors for their wings and dry ribs. I'm a fan of good wings like the regal beagle and such. While I love the wet Greek flavor enough to ask for extra to pour on like a salad dressing for wings, I simply can't stand the whiskey BBQ. I was truly sad that they are the one place on earth that doesn't understand you MUST cook the whiskey once it is put in the BBQ sauce so that the alcohol is all gone but the sweet, oaky and slightly smoky flavor of the whiskey is left to flavor the BBQ. The bartender and the owner even argued with me that I, every restaurant, chef and bottled BBQ sauce in the world that makes it this way were wrong and that they were right to leave the whiskey raw in the sauce. I have up then and just returned the wings. The last item I tried was the tiger onion rings which were actually tasty compared to other experiences at this bar. They make two different types of beer batter for the rings and this gives it a tiger stripe look and a slightly different taste from regular onion rings.

So in general I would say that this place is more for the night out when you want a cheap beer with a pal and you live or are in the Bowness area. The food is for the most part a pass unless you are really drunk or have a partner who brings you something home while out for that beer."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and a pint.  Pizza was fairly tasty if the crust was a tad undercooked for my taste.  My wife had a chicken sandwich, which was raw in the middle.  They comped our meal, but still can't give recommendation here.  Good beer selections.  Bar was a little on the dark and dirty side."}
