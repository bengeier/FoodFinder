{"text":"Pine Garden Is Theee BEST Chinese You'll Get Hands Down! Nowhere Else Compares..(I Believe They Were Also Rated The Best In The Country)Anyways, I Always Order The Moo Goo Gai Pan With Vegetable Fried Rice, Sooo Yummy! Oh & The Rainbow Shrimp Is Awesome As Well! They Have Huge Portions Which Is Great Because I ALWAYS Have Leftovers The Next Day! I Can Eat This Stuff For Breakfast It's So Good!  

Oh & My Suggestion Is To Call Ahead For Take Out... You're Not Paying For The Ambiance Of The Place. It's A Tad On The Run Down Side, Definitely Can Use Some Updating. However Don't Let That Stop You From Ordering! Pine Garden Is Like A Diamond In The Rough, You Won't Appreciate It Until You Have Tried  It For Yourself... So The Next Time You Want To Have A Movie Night On The Couch Think PINE GARDEN!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant. Their wonton soup is great. If you ever come here, I recommend getting the triple delight."}
{"text":"Went here last week with my wife and daughter and everything was excellent.  Our waiter was nice and informative and our food was great.  Only downside was the crab Rangoon it wasn't to my liking,  but totally worth a visit if your on this side of town."}
{"text":"I enjoyed that Sweet and Sour Chicken. Overall, I think their food is better than Golden Crown."}
{"text":"Have been going to Pine Garden for years. The food is great but I wish they would do some updating in the place, it is definitely apparent that is run down. But no problems with the food!"}
{"text":"The Pine Garden is perhaps the jewel of Lorain. Voted one of the 100 best chinese restaurants in the US, the pine garden menu has all the classic chinese fair. From the music to the hot oolong tea, Pine Garden has everthing you come to expect from a mid -level full service chinese restaurant.

The same family has been there running the restaturant as far as I can remember. Come to think of it, I have had the same waitress since 1994. You get the same great flavor  everytime, and service is wonderful. Small town charm meets great chineese food. I know I am biased, but this is the restaurant with which i compare all chinese fair."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful, been going here for as long as I can say I've been in Lorain.  The only thing that made me angry is when the owner stopped handing out free refills to customers.  This isn't something you do to your customers (let alone regulars).  If it wasn't for the great food, I would not return.  The owner is an a-hole to his waiters (then again, I don't see any American ones now), steals their tips.  If you get an American, please hand her the tips.  This man thinks he's entitled to the tip if he glances at you from across the room."}
{"text":"This place has exceptional value. I could absolutely not believe the price for the value. They could definitely charge much more for what you get here."}
{"text":"I always go with white rice, sweet and sour chicken, egg roll, and occasionally the beef and broccoli. Those are all good items on the menu. 
Owners are real nice people."}
{"text":"All around great!  Great food,  great portions,  great service! Spicy Tso Beef and chicken dishes are delicious and left overs are great lunch reheats wonderfully!"}
{"text":"Spending time in Ohio visiting relatives, I was on a Chinese Vegan craze back home (I'm not vegan, and this place isn't either, though they may have a few vegan dishes, I'm sure)  so I went on several review sites and stumbled across Pine Gardens. SO GLAD I DID!  It was delicious! No MSG, buffet bullshit. When we walked in we had to laugh because NO ONE was in there, but we didn't let that deter us and after we got our food, you couldn't help but wonder why the place wasn't packed (it has to be the crappy location, all the stores around it are abandoned) The food was freshly made when ordered,  it was very cheap ($6-$10 for dinner!) and they gave you sooo much of it.   Don't believe me, give it a try.

{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food! They welcomed my \"sleepy\" baby cousin with open arms :')"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Their eggrolls are the absolute best. The portions are huge and priced right.I literally won't eat any other Chinese food. The staff is friendly, even if understaffed."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here when I am in the area. My typical experience with General Tso's chicken is a disappointing order of chickened batter. DEFINITELY not the case here. Generous chunks of perfectly battered chicken abound in a nicely spiced sauce! (I thought I heard some clucking once but it may have been my imagination)  Great value, friendly staff and good food make this my favorite Chinese restaurant bar none."}
{"text":"I'm a new resident to Lorain. I was craving Chinese food one evening and was telling my neighbor how I had tried a few different Chinese restaurants in the area and they weren't the greatest. He quickly recommended Pine Garden Chinese Restaurant and assured me that I would not be disappointed. So I placed an order for take out. I ordered the General Tso's combination platter. It was amazing! Some of the best Chinese that I've had in a very long time. This making Pine Garden Chinese Restaurant my new go to for Chinese food as well as a recommendation to anyone who asks!"}
{"text":"Pretty good!! Gotta admit I'm spoiled from working and eating in Asiatown, but this place is pretty good. The menu is your typical American style Chinese food but I did find one dish I didn't recognize. Hong Sue Tofu. Very good!! I took one star off for the fact that there were no vegetable spring or egg rolls and the fact that the vegetable section of the menu was only 4 items. But all I all pretty solid place."}
{"text":"I can't honestly give this place more than three stars. The service could be much better and I don't mean the waitresses are bad it's just that whenever we go here there are not enough waitresses. The last time we ate here (it was a Saturday during dinner time) there was one person serving all the tables.

The food is up and down here. Pine Garden has one of the best fried rices and many other great dishes, but there are some that are not that great. Pine Garden has the worst General Tso's Chicken of any of the Chinese places in this area (it wasn't terrible, but I've had much much better pretty much everywhere else).

Overall a decent Chinese restaurant, but definitely has room for improvement."}
{"text":"My family and I love Pine Garden and have literally been coming here since I was born! We come here every Christmas Eve and love the food and the atmosphere. This past Christmas Eve there were 44 of us and they waited on all of us with no problem. We can be a very loud and overwhelming group but they are very professional. 

The best Chinese restaurant in Lorain for sure. That's why they've been open as long as they have. The service is good and the food comes out fast. I like the Curry chicken and the General Tso's chicken the most. The hot and sour soup is also very good!! A great appetizer to start with. The portions are very big and one order can be enough to share for two. A warm welcome when you walk through the door and I love coming back each year for the holidays!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Lorain County!!! Love the fried rice.  Owner is very friendly.  What impressed me the most was price per value."}
{"text":"I have been ordering take-out from the Pine Garden since I was a little girl. There are plenty of Chinese restaurants in Lorain County, but in my opinion the Pine Garden has always been one of the best. 

I'll be honest, the restaurant isn't located in the greatest of neighborhoods That said, I have never had any problems with safety and am totally comfortable going there after dark. The interior of the restaurant isn't anything special and is a little on the dumpy side, but I can definitely excuse that because the food and service are great! I suggest ordering take-out and eating the food in the comfort of your own home. 

A few years ago I ordered a ton of food for my high school students because they had earned a classroom party. I went and spoke with the manager (owner?) the day before and he was very accommodating. He totally hooked me up with a ton of food for a great price. When I picked everything up the next day it was warm, well-prepared and very tasty! Everyone was impressed!

The prices here are very reasonable, especially for the amount of food you will get. There is always enough for 2-3 meals. 

Don't let the location scare you away. It's definitely worth the trip into Lorain to try out this great Chinese restaurant. They must be doing something right...most small businesses in the area are in and out within a year. I'm not 100% sure how long they have been around, but I am 31 and remember going there when I was in my early teens."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Pine Garden since 1999 and It's by far the best Chinese Food in Lorain County.  There portions are generous and the food is amazing.  The owner's wife is the chef and she is an amazing cook.  There are an array of sauces like black bean, kung pau, white sauce, garlic sauce and they are interchangeable in many dishes.  The service is always great and the owners always remember you and offer a warm greeting.  The vegetables are always prepared fresh and aren't over cooked.  I have to admit I eat here several times a week, I just love the food."}
{"text":"Food is always awesome. Food is the cheapest you'll find anywhere and the quality is fantastic. Not your normal Chinese take out. Best sweet and sour chicken, soup, and egg rolls you'll ever have!"}
