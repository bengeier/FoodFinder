{"text":"Good urban atmosphere, but a little cramped, and the National Geographic-y picture in the back nook is kinda scary."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on an early Saturday evening, right before it got busy.  Nice atmosphere.  I had high hopes for the food, based on the other Yelp reviews, but I was kind of disappointed.  The Dim Sum dishes we had were okay (spring rolls, dumplings, shrimp cakes) but not awesome.  I ordered the raved-about three-cup chicken and it turned out to be the same kind of chicken you'd get at any Chinese restaurant (taste-wise).  I guess I expected a lot more for the price.  The Dim Sum prices were good for what you got, but the dinners are overpriced for what they are.  

The service was okay, food was served in an average amount of time, if not a tiny bit slow.

I would go here again, but with adjusted expectations.  And maybe next year."}
{"text":"This little  bar/restaurant is the place to go on a Friday night! It is the perfect date spot-- dim lighting, great drinks, and a decent wine list.  The food is amazing, especially their pizza because they have an awesome wood burning oven.  This place is better in cooler months though as they don't have air conditioning.  It gets a little sweaty inside during summer months!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night, and was very impressed by the food -- had the roast pork sammie, and absolutely loved it.  The perfect mix of smoke and porkiness and heat, on decent french bread.  The atmosphere was fine, I suppose, if cramped and not terribly great service, but certainly not terrible.  I'll be going back, if just for more pork sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've been to Natt Spil a few times and had pretty similar experiences each time. It's very busy on the weekends, but my most recent trip was on a Monday night with a group of 7 for dinner. 

The ambiance is funky and hipsterish. I like it generally, but it was too dark and the music was too loud for a Monday night. On a weekend night I expect this, but it was 7pm on a Monday and we wanted to hear each other. I have also never been to Natt Spil and had enough room. Even on a fairly un-crowded Monday night, the 7 of us were crowded at a table that could comfortably seat 5. 

Our server was attentive even though we were nestled back near the DJ. The food is pretty good. On Mondays you get a pizza and a pitcher for $16, which is a good deal, and we got 4 of these specials at our table, sampling 3 different pizzas, all of which were good. My husband had been excited about the mussels, which they didn't have that night. Salads were hit or miss, and the shu mai wasn't popular with a couple in our group, although my husband liked it.

The weirdest thing was that the beer wasn't very cold. We got 4 pitchers of 3 different types of beer. At least 2 of the beers were warm. In the past, I've ordered a bottle of wine that also came warm. It was red wine, which is still supposed to be served colder than room temperature, but it was definitely warmer than room temp. Disappointing because they have a pretty good wine list. Although they have a rotating beer list, I wasn't too impressed with their choices. It would be so easy to pick more popular or more exciting beers. 

I know lots of people who love Natt Spil, but I am still not sold. With so many better options with more light, more space, and better food, I'm not sure I see the point. I would probably return for the pizza and pitcher special, for late night drinks or food, but not for dinner on a random night of the week."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My husband, aunt, uncle, and myself were in Madison from Chicago. The place has a very interesting menu - dim sum and pizza were two of their specialties. Apparently we could not decide what to order, so we ordered everything! We had each kind of dim sum, and a sausage pizza, both of which were fresh, different, and delicious. But the real highlight was the duck duck soup. I really do not have words for it, and I am an English teacher!

They also have great beers, a swanky atmosphere, and a DJ camped out in the corner. Awesome all around!"}
{"text":"This place had great food, drinks, service, and music. The atmosphere is a little off the beaten path, which is refreshing and makes it an interesting place to go on the weekend."}
{"text":"The 3-cup chicken: awesome.

Their daiquiris - A TRAVESTY. Undrinkable, I think it had triple sec in it. Super gross. I will not get another drink from their Sunday bartender."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Madison...no, in Wisconsin (and that says a lot because we all know how many bars are in this lovely state). I've been going to Natt Spil for years and it has NEVER let me down. The atmosphere is sexy and the drinks/food are delicious. What more could you want?! My only complaint is that it is cash only, but that isn't really a big deal. I highly recommend this place to those looking to escape the undergraduate mess that occurs on/near State St. or for anyone who needs a late-night meal and prefers to have it served to them by friendly waitstaff. I"}
{"text":"Translates to \"night play\" or \"after party\" in Norwegian -- as you can imagine, this place is open late in the night all week.

I'd like to think of this Madison's hidden gem of a bar (no sign outside, no phone)! 

Good drinks; Great ambiance  - Intimate; Asian influenced- one of the owners spent a lot of time in China. 

Their wood-burning oven roasted pizzas are very good. Love their three-cup tofu - an amazing blend of flavors served with rice and pickled veggies. I usually have them go a little easy on the soy and it is perfect for me. Their hummus plate is also delicious and a good value for the money.

Seating -- if it is winter, find a seat further inside - the door opening can get pretty drafty.  If there is a DJ, the back of the place can get loud. The best, most intimate space is at the furthest back wall on the left -- there is a little alcove with about 4 tables! If it is summer, their front windows open out, so you can sit either up front or outside and it is quite nice.

Note: Small food menu and No credit cards accepted (ATM on site though)"}
{"text":"My lady and I attended the Natt Spil with the intention of a Friday night dinner but unfortunately found the results very dissatisfactory.  

While the decor is quite romantic and it's kinda cool to eat at a place that doesn't have a sign or a telephone the actual delivery isn't worth the setup.  All the pre-eat impressing sets up the expectation for some fabulously hip food.  The results however came as lackluster.

Ordering the Salmon with fried plantains and the Italian sausage pizza with feta we initially were excited.  A change of pace ambiance and a diversified menu with a combination of different ethnic flavors seemed promising.  With the placement of the dishes in front of us our eagerness seemed to fade.  To start the presentation was mediocre.  Admittedly there isn't too much you can do to make pizza look amazing.  The Salmon however was not pink, served upside down, and was about the smallest piece of fish I have ever received.   

Not a fish expert, I was told by my more knowledgeable girlfriend that the salmon was poor, not cooked well, lacking juices and a pink color.  I found the fish ok, tasting fairly bland and without any spice to cover up the disappointing bland salmon flavor.  The noodles that came with it were sort of a mix of curry and pad Thai which while better than the salmon were still rather dull noodles.  

The pizza was admittedly better though still a small portion.  The sausage was very good with a nice distinctive spice, the best part of the entire meal.  The feta was tasty..but it's feta and the placement of it on the pizza was effective because feta is inherently tasty nothing above your own ability in the kitchen though.  A dough and sauce that served as more of contributing flavors and less as bases would have helped.  

The seemingly harsh rating is a judgment of the food not as a place to grab drinks with a friend.  Their beer menu had simple selections highlights being some nearby Great Dane brews and an Ale Asylum.  In the end the food isn't bad, but for a the $12 dollars the tiny dull Salmon dish cost and the $9 decent Pizza better tasting and equally unique Madison flavors can be found."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with my husband for a light dinner one night, i'm not from Madison, I was just passing through and so happy to find this place! It was just what we wanted.  It was kind of a slow night and we sat waayyy in the back in a tiny dark little room and it was super cool and romantic and perfect.  There was a dj mixing great music, like every song I was pulling out sound-hound to find it.   Good service, good cocktails, good food.  I wouldn't say the food was mind-blowing amazeballs or anything, but very solid. Also the menu has a really nice variety, eclectic & comforting. Perfecto."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner with my wife and our son met us there. 
Nothing but amazing. We started with a few apps and then ordered dinner item we could all share. 
I highly recommend everyone try this place."}
{"text":"There is a great DJ that lays it down here like the first tuesday of every month (don't quote me on that). This place has some good food and bad food. The music is crazy loud. Some of the specials are good but nothing you'd consider fine dining. It's pretentious as fuck but that's part of the charm. The pettiness of trying to be cool in this town and turning that into profit... Good for you whoever leases this place... Good for you..."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Erin C.  This place is a great find that I've walked past numerous times on my way to other restaurants and always wondered about.  Now that I have experienced Natt Spil, I'm hoping it won't be more crowded next time I visit.
It was FABULOUS!
Dark and quiet with a friendly staff and an atmosphere that you can just sink into and enjoy.
Whether to meet a friend or enjoy a fabulous dinner, Natt Spil was a fantastic choice that will be made again!"}
{"text":"I have always had a good time here, but the slow service and unattentive bartenders always end with me standing with my hand on my hips not knowing why they are just standing there, and I am empy handed. That being said, they have a pretty decent and reasonable drink menu (I didnt know that $5 was \"pricey\") and lots of vegetarian options.  The dark atmosphere is oddly inviting but its often hard to find a place to sit, let alone stand since they have some oddly placed partitions dividing the booths and tables.  Good place to check out and start your night, but dont get too excited."}
{"text":"This review is based strictly off their customer service.

My wife and I were going out for dinner last night at Muramoto.  We arrived early (5:30p) to the King Street area.  So, we thought we would stop by Nat Spil for a couple pre-dinner cocktails.  Neither of us had been there before and were excited to give it a try.

Our initial take was we really liked the atmoshere - seemed very cool.  However, as mentioned in other reviews, we soon found that the place was small and a little confusing for us.  The place has about 10 tables that I could see and a small bar with about 12 stools.  Is it a restaurant or a bar?  The reason I bring this up is that when we walked in there were two couples sitting at tables and no one at the bar.  One couple had food and other couple just had cocktails.  There was no one to greet us when we walked in (i didn't think that was going to be a big deal but it obvioulsly was), so we sauntered over to the bar and ordered a cocktail.  After the drinks were poured we thought it might be more comfortable sitting at a table and told the bartendress - \"no problem\" she says.

We chose a table in the front window area.  It was small but had four sets of silverware.  Suddenly a waiter appears and asks if it just the two of us tonight.  \"Yes\" I replied.  He lets out a big sigh, and then snatches two of the silverware sets.  As he is walking to the cupboard to put them away I notice that he is shaking his head the whole time and is still visible pissed that there is only two of us.  He then takes the silverware he just cleared and started slamming/throwing  them back into the cupboard drawers.  

Let me take the opportunity to remind you that there were four other customers in this establishment at this point and it was 5:30pm.  It's not like we were occupying prime seats during prime time.  

So... The waiter comes back and says, \"what do want for dinner?\"  with an exaggerated roll of his eyes.   I said we were just having drinks and wouldn't be staying long.  Another hugh sigh and he storms off to his station and takes a big drink from his wine glass.  I was surprised to see the waiter drinking at 5:30.  I wonder if he paid for that drink or if it was stolen from the establishment's owner?!?

Well that pretty much sealed it - not going to have a second drink there.  We slammed our cocktails and high tailed it.  As we were leaving we had to walk right past him.  He never looked up or even acknowledged we were leaving.  

Interestingly enough... Around 8:00p as we were walking back to our car from Muramoto, we glanced into the front window of Nat Spil.  It looked they had a whooping crowd of about 6 people.  I wonder how many other people left after dealing with that ass-bag waiter?!?"}
{"text":"Offering shots to a table of noticeably disgruntled people does not rectify forgetting to put in a food order. Forget the DJ on a Wednesday night, stop letting your waitstaff drink on the job, and just do what you are trying to do-- be a cool looking bar, offer decent food, and make quality drinks."}
{"text":"Good drinks, good food.  Good god, why haven't you visited yet?"}
{"text":"I went here last Thursday while visiting the city of Madison with a group of friends, six to be exact.  We were thirsty so we bellied up to the bar right away.  The bartender was very friendly and looked like he was enjoying his job.  I was in search of strong drink so I ordered a whiskey sour which cost me a measly 5 bucks.  The drinks here are defiantly worth the price.  I ended up having to add two more people to our party last minute and our servers Jessica and Jamie were more than accommodating to help us out with the two additional guests.  I ordered a pizza which was relatively cheap and tasted amazing!  We finished our meal with more drinks and eventually left.  I will definitely be returning to the Natt Spil, on my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"Never have a bad thing to say about this place!  I just simply ADORE their dumplings. :) I don't quite remember the name of the bartender and cook but I think they were Jon and Travis? Big thanks to them :)"}
{"text":"Good food, great drinks, poor ventilation.  Sitting in back is fun most of the year, but you'll want to be front by a window in summer.  Cash only, but there's an ATM.

The pork sammie is fantastic.  It's savory, it's spicy, and so full you need the sturdy baguette to keep things together.

The duck duck soup is usually delicious.  Not as good as ramen at Umami, but an excellent appetizer and very comforting on a cold day.

Their wood-fired pizzas are well-executed.  I'm partial to the brie and apple, but I tend to enjoy the combination of cheese and fruits in general.

They have a decent selection of craft beers and they make good cocktails.  Start your evening here, and you can walk on to Opus or Merchant if you're looking for more."}
{"text":"I love this place!

Pros:

- The three-cup tofu is outstanding.  I know what you are thinking: \"Tofu? Really?\"  Yes, really.  I will be the first to admit that tofu can go terribly wrong, but this is delicious.  It is the first tofu that I have ever craved.

- The Dim Sum options are fresh and delicious.  I recommend the Sriracha wontons.

- The interior is awesome.  It is like a modern take on an opium den.  I find it very relaxing and engaging all at the same time.

- The service has always been very professional, knowledgeable, and on-the-ball.

- Lots of parking in the ramp around the corner by the Dane.

Cons:

- It can be loud on weekend nights.  This is a great place for dinner with friends before a show - a bad place for weekend romance.

- The seats are very close together.  Again, fun with friends, not so good for whispering sweet nothings.

- There can be a little bit of angsty hipsterness.  Embrace it and you'll be fine.

- Cash only, but they do have an ATM.

- The pizza is fine, but not rave worthy.  Try something else on the menu that is wonderful."}
{"text":"I also didn't have a problem with the atmosphere. I found it warm and welcoming and our waitress was very friendly. As a Bostonian, I'm used to being ignored by waitstaff, pricey yet boring food, being deafened by awful music and squawking fellow patrons time and time again.

But Nat Spil treated me very well- no pretension- and I will return!"}
{"text":"Awesome, amazing, fantastic!! Everytime my girlfriend and I come here we are treated very well by staff, they are friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is amazing and their pizzas are the best. The apple-brie pizza is highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I think I like this place because it is dark and narrow. Yes, that is all it offers, but that's enough. They have a standard beer menu for Madison, and the food is just alright. But I like sitting there and being able to take in the whole place without turning my head. It feels like a bar that just doesn't fit in with the rest of Madison, and that's a good change of pace."}
{"text":"I like how the atmosphere here has a cozy warm feel to it with its low lighting, cool wooden chairs and tables and DJs spinning some very good music.  The food has been very good too.  I love the thin crust mushroom and pepperoni pizza from their wood oven!  The pepperoni is cut into thick slices and have a spicy peppery bite to them.  I've had the crab/salad appetizer dish but wasn't that thrilled with it.  The crispy wantons (2) stuffed with shrimp and scallops surrounded by a spicy broth was delicious!  We just wished they could have added a few more wantons.  I can't wait to go back and try their mojitos and 3-cup chicken."}
{"text":"When we went to Nattspill, we had a really good time. The service was ok, but the food was great. We were a table of 6 we order almost the whole menu my favorite was the Pepperoni/mushroom pizza and the 3 cup chicken are really good,though we were a little bit disappointed with the service and certain menu items like the roasted veggies/salads"}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. All the food on the menu is great buy definitely get the Shu Mai and Three Cup Chicken. For drinks try one of their specialty cocktails and get a shot of the house infused coffee vodka. Cash only"}
{"text":"Natspil has excellent food and great prices and quite a funky little atmosphere.  The drawback is the space itself, which is quite small and can get crowded.  It also has a bit of a clique-y hipsters-only feel to it sometimes.  Servers flock to the bar to spend their tips at this place, and sometimes that is just not the crowd I want as a backdrop.  But go there in the early evening and order the pork sammy and some of the dim-sum.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Love this place...great atmosphere, tasty pizzas and the three-cup chicken/tofu rocks...Plus, the prices are reasonable and the staff cool/friendly, whether you are a regular or newbie...along with the Weary, it's my go-to place in Madison..."}
{"text":"When I eventually leave Madison, Natt Spil is one of a handful of restaurants I'll miss. 

As other reviewers have noted, the Three Cup Tofu and Three Cup Chicken are the bomb. I used to get the chicken, but as a New Year's resolution, I decided to torture myself more and animals less by only eating local/sustainable meat. Yes, I am those people in Portlandia. The first thing I thought of when I made that decision was \"no more Three Cup Chicken,\" which was rough, since this is one of two dishes I turn to whenever I crave eating out (the other is the Harmony Bar's walnut burger and chips with blue cheese). Since I made that resolution, I have turned to the tofu, which is fabulous. The dish comes with pickled vegetables and rice. 

I've never eaten anything bad at Natt Spil, but I also particularly recommend the pizza. 

Natt Spil also has the city's best drink, the Orange Dragon. It involves their Thai chile-infused vodka (which gives the drink a nice blast of heat) and orange blossom. The other week, Jeanette the bartender (also one of the city's best) made me a cocktail of the Thai chile vodka and the green tea kombucha, another fantastic cocktail.

The only crappy thing about Natt Spil is its design. I always sit at the bar, because then at least all the people I am with can have a view of sorts and a chair to sit in. I hate restaurant designs that force one person to sit staring at a wall and, in this case, with that person's butt in the middle of a (sometimes unbearably) busy restaurant. 

Seating issues aside, this is one of the best places to eat and drink in Madison. And in the evenings, there are always djs playing great music."}
{"text":"I stopped into Natt Spil tonight for the first time all year.

This is a great little bar. Emphasis on \"Little\". It's long and narrow and they don't have air conditioning. And they don't take credit cards.

That being said, they have a stylish little bar & excellent pizza made in a wood fired oven.

Tonight they had a DJ and it was REALLY noisy and hard to have a conversation, so we only had one drink and went on our way. 

We're planning to come back some night when they DON'T have a DJ and enjoy the pizza again"}
{"text":"This is and will remain my favorite bar/restaurant/hangout in Madison, until further notice. The BEST date place, unless of course you're dating some hoity toity fancy person. The best ambiance. I love the dark factor. 9 times out of 10 there's an excellent dj. Pizza gets an A+, mussels as well. It's not on the menu anymore but you can still order their Key Lime martini...and it's amazing."}
{"text":"Pricey drinks and a poor bar layout make for a crowded experience here. They've got DJs spinning on a pretty regular basis in the evenings, which is hit or miss. I've never eaten here, but the food coming out of the kitchen looks great and you can get food pretty late, which is a plus. My favorite part about this place is the huge window at the front which can be opened up during the (few) summer months in Madison, making the whole place feel a little opened up.

Nevertheless, I can't help but feel like this place is an overflow pub for the crowd not patient enough to wait for a table at the Great Dane next door.

A decent stop on a bar-hopping night."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a few drinks with a good friend and immediately felt at home. The place was busy, Sat night in the city and all, but tables were cleared quickly as people finished eating. We decided to wait for a seat at the bar. Loved the open concept and exposed kitchen next to the bar. Mood was relaxed, music was good. Noticed that there was a spot for a DJ overlooking the lower part of the space. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. It almost has an underground L.A. bar type feel to it. I have been coming here for about a year now and it is always a blast. They have a live DJ (every time I have been there) and I am assuming that is all they have. Drinks are good they even have absinthe! Reasonably priced but can get pricey."}
{"text":"natt spil natt spil.. It's probably one of my favorite bars in Madison. Tucked away on the King street next to the Great Dane. I have been coming here for drinks ever since I turned 21 so like 4 years ago? (god I'm getting old). I love the ambiance. it's dark.. most of the time you can't see anything (so come here if you just want to chill on a friday night with a drink or two and don't want to put any make up on .. no one will notice lol).  there's always a DJ when I'm there which are mostly on weekends. oh and the red oriental lanterns remind me of old school Chinese movies. In terms of drinks, I like the mojito.. really well made and so refreshing, reminds me of the mojito I had from Spain. I remember I was not a fan of Yokohoma mama but I don't remember what was in it. I also like High Tea, little gingerly taste and citrusy. I also had wine a few times. I have never had their martini.. not sure why.. but that will be on my list to try next time. My friend who's also a fan of Natt spil mentioned to me their dim sum is worth a try too. However I'm a little skeptical about the authenticity dimsum at a bar in Madison.. I will reserve my dimsum cravings for the tea house in Chicago. Last but not the least, for us poor college students, the price is not your typical college bar.. average drink ranges between $7-8 which is a reason why I gave it a 4 and not a 5."}
{"text":"Very good wood fired thin crust pizza.  Not greasy.  Very similar to pizza in Italy but with more toppings. Not cheap but not too expensive. Lively crowd."}
{"text":"Great and strong cocktails. Best mussels I've ever had. The sauce is incredible! The pizzas here are great too. It's also a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Got the BBQ sandwich; absolutely delicious but it was very oily. I completely understand WHY there is oil but it was overwhelming and my bread got soggy from it. Otherwise it was an amazing sandwich"}
{"text":"The vibe here was cool-there was a dj playing music that added to the already chill and very unique atmosphere. I can't explain what it's like inside, it's one of those places you just have to see for yourself. But it's worth the visit to see this off beat spot. 
The drink menu was refreshing and fun while not being too cliche to its theme. And the food was fantastic! I had a hard time deciding between pizza and the three cup tofu but I went with the tofu and was not let down. The sauce was phenomenal and the portions were insane. Way too much food.
The only thing that kept it from five stars was that the server wasn't the most attentive. It took quite a while between her visits although it wasn't particularly busy. But it definitely didn't color my experience enough to say I won't be back a hundred more times."}
{"text":"The food here borders on gross and is not that cheap if viewed in light of how crappy it is.

We started with the catfish egg rolls, which tasted like someone dropped a fish stick in Tabasco, put it in a wrapper and fried it. The three cup tofu is apparently their most popular dish. It looked beautiful and tasted completely uninspired. Tofu drowning in heavy, corporate \"Asian\" sauce with over-marinated cucumbers on the side. My limp pizza was the worst attempt at thin-crust I have encountered in Madison.

I guess this place is \"cool\" because the lighting is red and the waitresses wear stripes and polka dots at the same time. I've been here at night for drinks as well and found it very awkward. The music is loud, so there's no way to talk, but also no expectation of dancing. 

The positives: They have a nice selection of beers on draft and the waitresses were polite."}
{"text":"in one word--confusing. thanks for trying too hard. 
space is a little cramped but comparable to most bars in the lower east side/east village. the cozy dark lighting and wood is spoiled by the disjointed asian inspired ceiling. atmosphere is reaching for 'too cool for school' which is a shame cause the place could be chill. this ain't bushwick bitches. music was okay if generic.
menu was all over the place & reminded me of that seinfeld episode with the pakistani guy and the restaurant that served indian, italian & chinese food. made the mistake of ordering 'dim sum,' which literally & figuratively felt like sweaty balls. soup dumplings were gross--tasteless meat, chewy wrapper, no real soup. the other food around me looked good though, so maybe i just chose poorly.
drinks were good & not too expensive, although after a couple ale asylums i can't really remember. service was fine."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent beers, ambiance is dark comfortable asian/german with a DJ pumpin something loud, and usually good.

One thing I didn't like is that the waiter would not do separate checks. When I asked him \"why is that?\" he said \"because we don't do separate checks, I can tell you your individual totals if you like\" which to me was a barely acceptable answer mainly because this place is dope and I'm not about to get my panties in a bunch and get banned from this joint."}
{"text":"Why do  love Yelp? Let me count the ways:

-I pay more attention to what I am eating
-I focus on the surroundings and the service
-I get to write about a food!

But mostly I enjoy meeting other Yelpers. I recently met Kelvin at a Yelp event. He is 25, I am not. He asked if I would like to get together with him and his girlfriend. I was thrilled to do so.

The three of us met at Nat Spil. We way over-ordered but each and every dish was excellent. The food was presented beautifully and each dish was full of flavor. Servings are generous and we shared everything.

My favorites were the mussels, this time with the cream, and the Mediterranean Spreads. The mussels were plump and luscious. The other dishes were delicious; Apple Brie Pizza, Three Cup Chicken and shu mai.  

Oh, how could I forget about my Caipirinha. It was sooooo goood.

I love this place."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Period. I'm pretty sure this place is a drug front. All cash, super dark, shady staff, no sign. If you are a woman I would stay away. 

Menu is a mix of dim sum, pizza, and other really odd crap. It's like a gastro pub menu got hijacked by one of those people that try to scam you by sending an email in super broken English that your \"cousin\" is stuck in Manilla with no money and you should Western Union him money to get home. 

If you want to get treated like dirt, stare into blackness, and not be able to talk because a DJ is spinning a variation of house music the cast of Jersey Shore can't stand, this is your place. Enjoy!"}

{"text":"DIM SUM!

Perfect date night spot. It is dark and intimate. The loud atmosphere forces you to get close to who ever you are with... or yell. 

I have tried most of their menu items (they haven't changed much with the exception of their specials). My personal favorite is the three cup chicken. It is a huge portion of chicken and rice with a tomato salad. Other favorites include the dumplings, wood-fired oven pizzas, and pretty much everything else on the menu. 

Don't miss it. They don't have a sign, but the atmosphere will draw you in from the street."}

{"text":"Want to find the BEST mussels in Madison? You can't call and make a reservation, the place doesn't have a phone. You won't see it driving by. They don't have a sign in front. Once you're there, you better have cash...they don't take credit cards.  Of course I'm talking about Natt Spil. The venerable underground Madison institution on King St., just off the Capaital Square. 
Coming up on their 11 year anniversary, Natt Spil has been one of the best kept culinary secrets in Madison. Arguably serving the best mussels in Madison, this hidden gem (literally!) Serves some amazing food from one of the sparsest kitchens you'll ever see. Serving up neopolitan style pizza, awesome mussels, and other specialties, this is where the food industry people go to hang out, refresh, and regenerate after their shifts are done. With non-stop DJ music, bartenders bartenders (that wasn't a typo!), solid spirits, and terrific non-bar food eats, this is THE place to be...especially late night.
Order anything off their very eclectic menu, and you won't be disappointed. The mussels are the best I've found in Madison.
It's hard to find, but once you do, you'll be a regular too. Just be ready to buy your favorite server or bartender a drink when you run into them there."}
{"text":"On a perfect summer day in Madison we stopped by to grab a late dinner snack at Natt Spil, one of our favorite relaxed but obscure spots with the decor of an opium den slash western saloon. It was lively but we found seats right away, close to the window since their few al fresco sidewalk tables were all taken. 

No more duck duck soup on the menu, but a BBQ pork soup instead. We opted for the Natt Spil sausage pizza, which had a crunchy crust and juicy center, with spicy fennel and pepperoncini seeds mashed between bites of goat cheese and tomatos. The High Tea was a refreshing, citrusy gulp and an appropriate accompaniment. Music-wise, they played everything from motown to grunge - but all good music - until the DJ came on around 9pm.  

Cash or local checks only!"}
{"text":"Came here while bar hopping downtown for a first date...pretty fun place...just not the place for a first date due to it being so loud.

But....The atmosphere is super awesome at Natt Spil! it was really dimly lit but the candle lit tables help bring that extra glow...especially with the good company I had, made it a bit more cozier. 

I ended up getting the Hot Bourbon Cider off of their 'Specialty Cocktails' a bit too strong for me, but very tasty non the less.  And we also shared the chips, guac and salsa...pretty good. 

When we were there they had a DJ coming in, so soon after he started playing we ended up leaving just due to the noise and trying to talk. But seems like it would be a fun place to get drinks, and do a little dancing maybe? 

Also...our waiter was pretty fantastic as well! Pretty attentive to us and always making sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"Ah, the good ol' Spil. This place is one of my favorites in Madison for so many reasons. 

The vibe is awesome, warm, low light, oriental feel, relaxing and very chill. There are DJs playing a variety of awesome music to keep things fun. The place also smells of amazing food being made as you can basically see your food being prepared. Traffic fluctuates through the evening which makes it pretty fun. The spil is busy for a reason. It is a great place.

The staff. This is something I come back for. The staff is inviting, friendly, as well as professional. From the bartenders, to servers, cooks and even the door guy, the staff works hard to ensure you are having a great time. They keep the bar top clean, they clear your plates swiftly when finished eating, they move well through the small spaces. Brett and Laurel, who generally tend bar are great. Fun time, super kind... Great people.

The food. The good stuff! This place has a menu that is consistent and great all around. There pizzas are my favorite. The wood fire oven in the middle of the does work! Great ingredients on a crispy crust. The three cup chicken is a favorite among many. The chefs are great and it is also fun to watch them work! Start off anything with the Shu Mai, it's damn good.

The drinks. They know their stuff on this one. From martinis, cocktails, mixed drinks, their signature coffee shot (home made coffee infused vodka) they strive for excellence. Drinks are balanced, light and taste great. 

Like I've said. The Spil is amazing for many things, a first date, a solid go to spot to eat, or a solid start or end to the evening for a good drink. Could not recommend it more. 5 stars no question."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere at this joint. It's become a regular stop in the last year. Great soundtrack!  If you try one food item, check out the pork sammie. If you try one drink, go for the high tea. If you don't try either one, then fuck you...I didn't want you to try them anyway."}
{"text":"I don't get what this place is supposed to be.

Is it a bar? Is it a lounge? Is it a restaurant?

Well, first of all, there's always music in the background. And by music, I mean really loud sounds. I'm trying to make conversation here, helllloooo?!

Second, this place is really dark. I don't know about you guys, but I'm pretty bad at seeing in the dark. Mix that with the small, cramped space and too many glasses of alcohol, and you will definitely see someone make a fool out of themselves (most likely me. Ok it was me....).

Third, why are your waitresses so surly? I'm coming in to buy a few drinks, so the least you can do is take my order without attitude. I don't expect to be greeted with smiles, rainbows and butterflies, but when I'm trying to throw money your way, be a bit more responsive. 
 
Whatever, at least the Merchant is right next door."}
{"text":"Crowded and hip. Live dj. Snag a booth and you will be a happy camper. Average beer selection."}
{"text":"Very cool vibe-- there isn't a banner though so you have to look out for it or you'll miss it! The Pork Sandwich is awesome, as is the brie and apple pizza (I get mine with bacon-- yum!). Cash only I think. Avoid the chili infused vodka and stick with beer. On Monday, they have a pizza and pitcher special. Nice! Crowd is always interesting too..."}
{"text":"Natt Spil is on the top of my list for go-to bars. This place can easily be missed since it does not have a sign outside, but once you discover it you'll be glad you did! I like many of their menu items, but my favorites are the spicy cheese won tons, chips and salsa, the shu mai, and the pepperoni mushroom pizza. I love the brick oven they have because it gives this place such a cozy feeling. Make sure to take a shot of their house infused coffee vodka. Goes down smooth and it'll give you that needed dose of energy! Service here makes you feel like you are part of a family. Servers and bartenders are so welcoming and they always go above and beyond when it comes to making the customer happy. Shout out to Nate, Travis, and Kym. Great crew. A very important thing to know is that this is a CASH ONLY bar. Come prepared. If not, there is an ATM. Make sure to check out their awesome mural that they have by the back of the bar."}
{"text":"Two things that you need to know 1) it's cash only (as someone that never has cash on them, I think it important to know - plan for it!) and 2) if they're busy, don't sit on the side of the table where people walk by if you're bigger (I got bumped a ton!).

There, now that those points are out there... it is quite the 'hole in the wall' but not quite a dive bar ... bar. You may miss the entrance on your first visit. The inside is dimly lit, allowing for an intimate experience - maybe not for the first date, but definitely the third!

I still need to make it back to try the food, so far I've just gone for what was supposed to be just one drink and turned into several. That place will do it to you, haha."}
{"text":"Writing bad reviews makes me nervous, especially when talking about local establishments. But ya gotta do what ya gotta do...

After reading many glowing reviews by my peers, I had high expectations for Natt Spil. This sweet little hole-in-the-wall promised excellent food and a relaxed atmosphere. The venue delivered. I enjoyed to low lighting and chill environment, but the service was slow and lightly attentive. The food, sadly, sort of paled. 

The biggest bother was the tomato cucumber salad. Chunks of tomato and cucumber had been marinated for what felt like days at room-temperature. The soggy texture was unappetizing, but I ate it because it was one of two vegetable-heavy options on the menu. You'd think the dish would have more finesse because they also served it as a side for the 3 cup chicken, one of their most popular dishes. And I'm not entirely sure why the 3 cup chicken is so popular... I could have got something of the same quality from a Chinese take-out place. The spring rolls were bland, with a sweet bottled chili sauce. Not my jive... The dumplings (shu mai), on the other hand, were fine. I've had better at a dim sum house in Kansas City, but I'm pretty sure these are the only ones of their kind in Madison, so try them if you've never experienced them. 

The pizza at Nat Spill still makes me a little curious. I haven't had it, but maybe that's what people go there for? I already found a few pizza places in the area that I really enjoy, so not sure I'm curious enough to go back..."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by the bartender at the Up North bar down the street. I asked him for something local and good and he hands down recommended this place. He said there was no sign and to just go so i did. I made him point it out to me on the map and I'm glad I did or I probably wouldn't of found it. It was a Monday night so it wasn't busy and i just walked in and grabbed a table. Ordered a greek pizza and it was awesome. I couldn't eat it all even though it was only about the size of a large plate. I enjoyed it and would come back again!"}
{"text":"This place houses my FAVORITE meal in madtown... 3 CUP TOFU!
This stuff is amazing!  White rice topped with a deliciously sweet and spicy sauce with tofu that is cooked to perfection with some amazing pickled vegetables on the side.  My boyfriend is a meat eater and this is always what he orders as well.  And we always start with the chips and guac.
Seriously, stop in for this meal!!!
Drink wise, they have a large selection, I usually get a beer and the bf loves the high tea (i think that's what it's called).
Love that they have DJ's every night.
As for the crowd, I feel as if it is the perfect mix of all types of people."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Good music. Good choice of cocktails. Pita wedges were way too oily."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by Natt Spil before The Nutcracker on a Friday evening. It was my first time and my friend's second time dining there.  When we arrived, around 5:30, the place was pretty empty, save a couple of folks at the bar and another table of people.  When we sat down, the waitress came over immediately to ask for our drink order. My friend ordered her drink, but I wasn't quite ready and asked for a minute to check it out. We did not a get a minute. We did not get two minutes. We got FIFTEEN minutes until our waitress came back to check on us.  My friend tried to get our server's attention at least four times, and each time it was almost as she made a conscious effort to ignore us. When she finally came back we were ready to order drinks, our appetizer, and our food.  I ordered my food and my drink, and when my friend ordered her food, she mentioned her drink again. The waitress replied, \"you already ordered that.\" My friend kindly pointed out that she hadn't received it yet, to which the waitress barked back that the bartender was busy because there were a lot of people coming in.  Okay, then.  When I was finally brought my drink (a cider) it came in a can, which I was unaware of. I would have liked a glass to drink it in, but our server literally did not come back until after our dinner had arrived and my drink was mostly gone. 

I was really hoping that the food would completely make up for the poor service we had received, but sadly, I was not impressed. We ordered the spicy cheese wontons which were basically giant fried wontons with a teeny tiny bit of (not spicy) cheese in them and some kind of (maybe?) sriracha sauce. I didn't like them at all. It came with three, and my friend and I both only ate one.  Very quickly after the appetizer had arrived, our food came. The table was super cramped. I appreciate that the food came quickly, but it drives me crazy when the dinner comes within like five minute of the appetizer. I choose the brie and apple pizza for my meal. This was the best part of the entire experience, but it still wasn't that great.  The pizza itself was cooked perfectly. The crust was excellent.  The toppings, however, were a bit lackluster. I was expecting more flavor from a pizza with brie, apple, shallots and sage. It definitely wasn't bad, it just needed a little more...something. I would have tossed a bit of salt and/or pepper onto it, but there weren't any shakers at the table.  

When we left, the restaurant was still not full, which surprised me, because I have always heard Nat Spill described as one of those tiny places that you have to get to early to get a seat. This was definitely not the case, and it seemed like they had trouble serving the patrons they did have. This restaurant is listed on Madison.com's list of 30 plates that define Madison, but honestly, it was a pretty big disappointment.  I can overlook bad service for really good food. I can overlook just okay food if there's really awesome service. This place had neither. Bummer."}
{"text":"I think this was the first restaurant I ate at in Madison. And it definitely set the right tone for the rest of the city.
No sign at the door, which makes it a little hard to wander in unless you know you are coming here. For reference, it's right next to the Great Dane. Also, bring cash. But then again...if you forget there's an ATM conveniently located inside.

We're pretty boring when it comes to this place. Meaning that what we got that first time was so good that we barely deviate. Usually go with the following dim sum: duck duck soup, mussels, and dumplings.

Some of our deviations have not been too pleasant. For some reason have never had luck with any of the daily specials. And for pizza we unfortunately only tried the brie and apple (what was I thinking??) 

The atmosphere is killer and they always have a live DJ. Yeah."}
{"text":"I'm sad to write this place isn't what it used to be. Went early on a Saturday evening to have a cocktail and small plates. 

I started with the raspberry kombucha Collins. It has gin, which I prefer to whiskey (the other drink they make with kombucha), but it wasn't great. I'm often afraid the fruit added to a cocktail will be overpowering, but in this case, I would not have known there was raspberry in my drink if it hadn't been listed on the menu. I was looking forward to a drink with kombucha, but this just didn't do it for me. 

My husband and I shared 3 items:
- pickled vegetable salad: I love pickled veg, but this was so terrible I could not eat it. The dish would benefit by having less - a lot less - vinegar. I was surprised when the nearly full bowl was left and I told the waitress I didn't like it that she didn't remove it from our tab or offer to bring something else.

- three cup chicken: it sounds so amazing on the menu, but it's the equivalent of fast food Chinese you might find in an office or school cafeteria. The flavors did not match the description, and the \"chicken\" pieces were shaped like small pellets. Definitely some sort of over processed chicken meat product.

- Middle Eastern plate: this was quite good. I liked the purées, although they were a bit on the stiff side. I really liked what they did with the pita. It had some olive oil drizzled on it and had been in the oven long enough to make it perfectly crispy. That's good stuff! The olives were good as well.

It's such a distinctive little place, I expect the food quality to be much better.  I hope they can kick it up a notch."}
{"text":"What a cool little place.   I would say it's \"Dive\" but that could be taken negatively. 

There is no sign outside, there is no sign on the door, no real advertisement - nothing that would ever tell you \"Come inside me and have a great time\"

The Decor was great.  It was very peaceful and the people / servers were all very friendly and nice.    Quant, fun, and loved the food.  

I had a brick fire oven pizza (artichoke, feta cheese, red peppers, and pepperoni) - Breathtaking!!!  

The dumplings I had as an app. was the best way to start the meal - and I ended it with a huge brownie!!

I will certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Natt Spil for a couple years now. Just about every time, I say that I'll never come back. But my decision to come back is fueled by the one or two times I've been here and LOVED it. 
Welp, that last time is it! 

The good:
It's a cool looking spot and is definitely unique. The cocktail menu is great!!!

The bad:
First off, it's a hard spot to bring a lot of people. Their menu is sparse and consists of about 4 pizzas, a weird assortment of appetizers, and chicken with rice. Food quality and preparation is not consistent. One day you order something and it is fantastic. The next day you order the same thing, and it's too spicy to eat and just terrible.
The worst of the worst is the service. Last night our server all but forgot about us. Dropped off our food and didn't come back till she dropped off the bill... 
Would have been nice if she came back to check on the food or offer more cocktails. One of our appetizers was so spicy hot, it was inedible and just sat, pretty much untouched, for the duration of our time there. The waitress. was very flip, rude, and looked like she just rolled out of bed (a real greasy one).
When I look back on other times at Natt Spil the less than friendly service always sticks out in my mind. A feeling of superiority always seems thick.

The service is the main reason I'll never go back or suggest Natt Spil again."}
{"text":"I had the brie apple pizza with sage and it was amazing.  The chefs are literally cooking behind the far corner of the bar. The bartenders are nice and make great drink. Ambiance is really unique.  Great value. One of my top recommendations."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is not good. I just so spent 22 dollars for a \"pizza\" that tasted really really bad and 10 dollars for a watered down cocktail. Service was on part with the food. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Natt Spil is a dark, shotgun-style space with Oriental decor, a Chinese-meets-Italian menu, and a Norwegian name. It's...a little different, to say the least. Sadly, I think the owners have overreached, but maybe they just need more time.

My friend and I met in the dark (very dark) back for a nice supper, but instead chose to go with a couple of small plates. Just as well, as that is the focus of the very small menu. Our cocktails took an inordinate amount of time to get to us, but were well-prepared. My friend's \"green thumb\" was deemed good and my negroni was solid.

Food also took a while to get out to us. The shu mai were just on the good side of decent, with a fair sauce and a generous plumpness. However, the water chestnut purported to be within was not noticeable in either taste nor texture. The brie and apple pizza, however, was a pleasant surprise. While the sage was a suggestion at best -- and maybe that's a good thing -- the pizza was cooked propery and generously topped with nicely melted brie and clear, fresh apples that complemented the crisp-tender but uncharred crust of the pizza. Quite good, and worth returning for,.

Natt Spil is a strange, disjointed place off King Street that I cannot figure out 100%. They're getting a three-star rating instead of a two-star simply for that. While drinks were good, our service was slow and the food nothing special. I'm not saying avoid it, but I'm not really recommending it either."}
{"text":"An unmarked building.  Dark, mood lighting inside.  A DJ in the back spinning records (this night was techno!).  I present you Natt Spil.  Such an interesting, yet lovely ambiance.

The ambiance feels really cozy, and everyone is situated at wooden tables/booths throughout.  It reminded me of a place I had been to in NYC that I had ventured to before, and absolutely adored.

They had a great beer selection, and their pizzas looked divine (I wish we had come sooner to try a few)!  I was in a fancy mood, and opted for a glass of sauvignon blanc to tide the evening over. Also, bring cash, or use their ATM in the back."}
{"text":"Dim Sum and Pizza? If you know me....you know this is my kind of place! 

The dim sum definitely isn't the best I've had, but great dimsum is hard to find in madison. They had a chicken dish that was DELICIOUS. And obviously their pizza was great! I also tried an alcoholic drink they had mixed with Kombucha! 

It had a cool vibe with eclectic asian decor. I think this would be a nice casual date spot to grab a drink."}
{"text":"Hidden gem, that's cash only.  Dim Sum and wood-fi oven  pizzas are the mainstays on the menu.  I recommend a seat at the bar or one of the small booths adjacent to take in the low light asian-styled decor.  In my trip, I stuck to the dim sum menu and sampled the spicy  cheese wontons and steamed dumplings.  I especially recommend the spicy cheese wontons.  If I ever make it back to Madison, I have to swing in for a bowl of bbq pork soup and/or the 'za."}
{"text":"I have visited Madison a handful times now, and each time I make a point to eat at Natt Spil. The service is genuine, the environment is quaint, and the food is fantastic. I recommend the mussels to start, and you MUST have Dave O's Roast Pork Sandwich. We happened to be there at a time when Dave was working, and I literally thought about asking for his phone number so we could hang out. He has a great taste in music too. GO TO NATT SPIL"}
{"text":"Always enjoy myself here when I can secure space, which actually isn't the case 1 out of 4 times (I don't place blame on the bar for that obviously!). The service is great. Any time I've noshed over my drinks, the fare's been tasty. The bartenders do a great job mixing drinks, and during the warm season, sitting outside at one of the little tables they have is really great. This place is great for a mixed group of people with regards to those who want to eat and those who are only there for drinks. Honestly, the crowded atmosphere only really gets to me when I can't get in and secure a space, but it's okay because I end up just hopping somewhere else instead. Love this place and I'll always consider it one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"This place is so unassuming to walk by. If I had not been taken here I would never have thought to stop in for dinner. I'm very glad I did though. I've only been for a few casual meals all of which were great. But I try to go back when I can. I know it gets a little crazy later at night but I prefer an early dinner here since the food is the star attraction. 

Where else can you go for dim sum, dumplings, pizza, chips and salsa/guac, and pita with a hummus-esque dip. Personal faves are the 3 cup chicken, spicy cheese wontons, and basically any pizza."}
{"text":"Here's what you need to know about Natt Spil:

There's no sign, it's dark, kinda small and narrow...but there's a DJ there every night! Their bartenders are always awesome-especially if you're service industry. (Tully, anyone?)

Let's be honest, it's kind of a sexy spot. The shumai is pretty good, and their three cup chicken is to die for--the salad that come with it is...*mwah*, beautiful--really good cucumber and tomato action going on. I'm kinda craving some now so maybe you'll see me there tonight. ;)

I've got low key love for Natt Spil and I only wish they would get a credit card machine because who loves ATM fees? No one."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the decor, love the atmosphere, but you can end up waiting a long time for a table, and it can get rather crowded with so many people in a small space.

Loved the fusion menu and the creative ways in which meals are prepared. Definitely a great place to go for new and exciting options."}
{"text":"Been here seven times, and it has good and bad. The eclectic menu is mostly fun, and pizza is a solid choice. Love the great cocktail menu, and decent beer selection. Great cozy ambiance other than weekends. Good place to pop in with one person, but not six. Problems: often overcrowded, bad flow of space, with strangers hanging over you during dinner. Wait service is sporadic, and sometimes it's clear they don't want to be at work. Seven out of ten, or 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Didn't know about it until I began working with one of the managers and we went for happy hour. I've been a few more times, and it is a cool atmosphere. It has warm (but dark) lighting and a good drink selection. The menu is short and interesting, but everything is worth trying. I recommend the hummus place and the brie and apple pizza (add bacon to it).

This is a cool place to go for casual drinks on a weekday in the winter months."}
{"text":"FOod is always great here, but service was shotty this time around. My friend and I approaches the hostess stand and asked if there were any available seats (the place looked busy) and she told us we could go check for ourselves--so much for customer service!
Food was good but took a long time and our waitress was super busy. We also mistakenly sat next to a loud table with 5 children under the age of 2 that were screaming the whole time. This kind of ruined the atmosphere."}
{"text":"AMBIENCE! This place has 'it'. 

Natt Spill is dark and relaxing, yet hip and exciting. It's a juxtaposition if there ever was one. This contrast can also be seen in their small, yet truly unique menu. Want pizza? Sure! Craving some dumplings? You got it. Or how about some chips and salsa? Uh-huh, okay!

My favorite is the brie and apple pizza. Delicate and sweet. The dumplings are also a high contender. My friends have even coerced me into trying the mussels and I can say they aren't half bad. My 'buds were more in favor of the cascabel cream and bread-for-dipping that accompanied it, though. I generally wash it all down with the dangerously good cocktail, the High Tea, and I am good to go...

..After I have just one more cocktail."}
{"text":"Cool, pseudo-underground bar in Madison. Very unique decor, and mysterious lighting. They usually have a DJ on busy nights.

Food is good- good asian-ish selection of snacks. Three cup chicken/tofu is solid, along with their pizza selections.

They have a pretty solid drink menu; good liquor selection and interesting beers on tap.

If they started accepting credit cards, this place would blow up. Maybe that's intentional; don't think it could handle much more people."}
{"text":"Natt Spil is a must for me every time I make a trip to Madison.  However, it can get pretty crowded on some nights.  This wouldn't be problem except for the fact that the venue is small.  You can't do much moving around on busy nights and waiting for a table can take forever.  Still, the atmosphere is really nice and comfortable on a low key night.  It's a great place to have dinner and conversation with friends.  There's a fairly priced Asian fusion menu.  No where else have I been able to choose between dim sum or pizza.  The mussels are a favorite!  I'm not much of a drinker but the drink menu is definitely extensive and you'll have plenty to select from.

I always look forward to stopping by Natt Spil.  It may be hard to find for a first timer, as there are no literal signs that give it away, but once you do find it, you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"This is the best bar in Madison, hands down.  I actually would place it as one of the best bars in the USA.  

I was there last Saturday night and the DJ they had spinning was killing it (as usual).  I spent two years at grad school in Madison and i stopped here several nights a week.  Good music, good cocktails, and good food.  The menu, while small, is excellent.  If it is your first time there, definitely have the Three Cup Chicken.  I have heard a few people say it is a little salty, but isn't that what beer is for?  The pizza's are all good and they usually have some good appetizers also.  

The beer selection is diverse yet representative of Wisconsin.  The only knock on this place is that it can get hard to navigate when it gets crowded as it is a small bar.  The servers manage to navigate it pretty well though so if you just grab a seat you'll have no problem getting service.  I hate to even write a review of this place because if too many people (or  undergrads) get wind of the place it might lose it's charm.  

But as is, Natt Spil, you are perfect!  Now please open a branch down the street from me in Chicago."}
{"text":"Dim sum and pizza - strangest combo but this place is a favorite of mine.  Drinks are on point.  Hipster vibes but the lighting and atmosphere are so great, who cares?"}
{"text":"This place has more \"cool\" atmosphere than anywhere else downtown and you have to be ready for that.  The hipsters will be everywhere and the DJ in the corner won't really be doing anything....but it's a cozy place to go with a friend or a date and certain menu items are incredible.  The brie and apple pizza is unlike any other and they usually have a special pizza that can be just as amazing.  Also, the Three Cup Tofu, while a bit pricey ($9.50,) is fresh, unique, and so good.  Other than that, the menu is small and too expensive, so get a Caipirinha (one of the only good ones in town) and enjoy a nice, mellow night out."}
{"text":"We were lucky to stumble onto this place. If it weren't for the hipster-ish crowd spilling out into the sidewalk seating we may have missed it all together (and I think they're okay with that). 

It's a small menu, but everything seems very specific and fulfills its purpose. A little Asian, a little bistro, and a decent beer list with some Lake Louie and Ale Asylum.

The feel of the place was late-night even during a regular dinner hour, which is unusual for the area. I'm thinking this is why so many reviewers found it pretentious, but really, it just felt a little more urban than most Madison places, but not overly trendy at all. If anything, it felt a bit off the beaten path. There was a mediocre DJ and the crowd went from lively to chill as it got late.

The food was tasty -- spicy, a bit too salty at times, and the flavors were particular. We had the Three Cup Chicken, a spicy and light Asian dish with Spicy Tomato Cucumber Salad (the best part!), and the Dave O's Cherry Wood Roast Pork Sammie, a spicy and salty sandwich with perfect french bread. I'd be happy to go again and try other dishes. 


Overall, it's a cool and unique option in Madison's Capital area (most late-nite options are on the University side, it seems) with an interesting menu."}
{"text":"we sat in the cave
it was hot and sweaty and kinda a bad idea
the food is stronger in idea than in execution
the servers are lovely and eager
it's not bad"}
{"text":"This hidden establishment is cozy, dark and welcoming. When you first enter you are greeted immediantly and are given choices of where to dine.  (unless you will just be sitting at the bar, which is also magnificent. )
Natt Spil is a long narrow dimly lit rustic sort of atmosphere. (it is usuallly PACKED on the weekends, so beware)  there are super cozy corners with a few finished tree stumps for seating which are nestled up to dark real wood tables. Also there are boothes for larger (4 maybe 6 top) groups along the bar area but I love the cozy areas. 
Natt Splis' food it seriously worth a trip. The wood-fired oven is a major plus for their offerings (the pizza's OMG)....but I personally love the Mussels!! The two variations i have indulged in are just over the top amazing. 
The dim sum is exquisite. You must dive into them!!...(right around the corner from Great Dane btw)..if you desire differerent and satisfying, playful delicious Martini's, attentive bartending, and incredible eats worth remembering. you must find them!!!   Natt Spil has been one of my most memorable experiences in Madison. (a few times) Do It!!"}
{"text":"Oh, Natt Spil, you're a fun place to hang out at. You've got wonderful cocktails and delicious infused vodka.

Your food? Well, that's pretty good, too.

But when one of your waiters decides to take food away when we're clearly not finished eating? Well, that's going to cause you a loss of two stars. And, I might add, a decline in tip percentage.

Three stars, easily could've been 4+. Service takes a nasty toll, though. Tsk tsk."}
{"text":"Owned by the people at the very strong Magnus, Natt Spil seems to fall into the 'we-wish-we-were-cool' category. Too cool, evidently, to put up an awning or name over the bar. The food is OK, though I'd rather eat at Magnus' bar around the corner (or at any of the dozen or so bars within walking distance). Drinks are fine. The music should be a lot better for what they're trying to do. They need to import a Williamsburg hipster to curate the atmosphere or something. In general I don't have a good time when I'm here; perhaps it's because of the overtly-evident artifice (i.e. it's trying too hard but not quite making it), the pretentious yokels with emo or Ramones t-shirts, or perhaps due to the cramped space. But I like their mini pizzas."}
{"text":"Try the lemongrass and ginger-infused vodka! Coming from Milwaukee, I didn't find this place all that hip and pretentious at all. I actually really liked the atmosphere - although I probably wouldn't chose to dine there considering how loud, crowded and tiny it is. Great for a few drinks though!"}
{"text":"Natt Spil is up there as one of my favorite places to go when i'm craving drinks and food.  First off, the place isn't labelled, and doesn't even have a phone.  So, note that it's the building with the green awning next to The Great Dane further down King.

With that out of the way, i'll say that the food is awesome, and there's plenty of variety.  Some of the dishes I liked a lot included the brie & apple pizza, the middle eastern vegetarian snack plate, and the three cup tofu.  It's well worth making separate trips to try them all, because you'll also want to keep coming back for the drinks.  In addition to having a wide selection of liquors, they concoct several specialty drinks, and a lot of them are hits.  I recommend just giving any of them a whirl if you're not too picky, otherwise the chocolate martini and the Pom Collins are sure winners.

The Natt Spil's ambience might be polarizing to some, but I really like it.  It's very dark inside with only accent lights, and there's a small outdoor area in the front.  Nearly every night there's a DJ spinning records, and the selections are unconventional, but serve as perfect background music for chatting with friends.

Natt Spil is one of Madison's best kept secrets, and at the very least I highly recommend going to see what the hype is about."}
{"text":"No name outfront, dark and uninviting, but it is very warm, nice and cozy insude. A candle on every table. We got Three cup chicken, wood fire grill pizza and spicy cheese wintons. Loved the chicken and the pizza. I asked the owner what Natt Spil meant, he said \" Night play\" a Norwegian name."}
{"text":"When choosing my star-rating of places on Yelp, I usually compare the establishment to some sort of standard for the category it is in. This is impossible for Natt Spil, because there is no category. This is the iron man of food and drink joints. If you do not come here while in Madison or the neighborhood specifically, you are missing out!

Whether it is their rocking Dim Sum (my group split 3/4 of the options, and they were all top notch), their pizzas, or the eclectic options like this unbelievable Duck Duck Soup, you can't go wrong!

The drink options also abound with great local and farther options of craft beer and cocktails that looked quite tasty (stuck to beer though, so I'm just guessing).

Service was friendly and attentive, and the whole feel of this place is just hip while still being comfy. There's even a DJ tucked away in the place too.

Seriously, do not miss this place. We will be back whenever we're in Madison."}
{"text":"Natt Spil has a super fun ambiance- dim lights, funky wood benches and decor. 

Tonight we had the brie/apple pizza tonight and the dumplings as a starter. They were both really good. Although, we would have liked the pizza toppings to be a little more spread out towards the crust, the apple and cheese were more concentrated in the middle . 

We went on a Monday where there's a deal of a pizza and a pitcher of beer for $17-- not bad! Also got a birthday shot of their coffee infused vodka- yum!

Our server was very friendly and attentive. We had been there before so had an option or two of what we wanted, but he was able to give some good tips.

Great place to go on a date or out with some friends."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. It's got a nice atmosphere with a DJ on weekends usually playing mellow reggae or other calm electronic music. I think this place used to be a pizza place with a brick oven that was retained and Asian items were added to the menu when it turned into Nattspil.

Usually have pretty decent local beer but always have 15-20 botttles. Cocktails are good. 

We ALWAYS get three cup chicken with an extra side of the veggies.  The veggies are delicious as is the chicken.  You must get both first time there.  Pizzas are good, Nattspil Sausage being our favorite. 

We really like this place overall.  It can be packed on weekends so go early or on weekday. Also, it is cash only with ATM inside. Prices are very reasonable. We usually spend $50-60 with drinks, three cup chicken, side of extra veggies, and a pizza. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a great place if you're in with the artsy crowd... and don't mind crowds.

It's small, but the service is generally better than OK, so is the food, and so are the drinks.

For a night out, get there early and expect loud music and a small crowd. As long as you're okay with that, it's a great little spot.

Oh, and hit the ATM before you go... it's cash only."}
{"text":"The food was horrible. I tried the Greek Goddess Pizza and a sausage and mushroom pizza as well. They crust was very crispy and somewhat burnt and the sauce was mediocre. My sausage and mushroom pizza tasted like a $3 Jack's frozen pizza that was on the dark side. For $10 they should have paid me to eat that cardboard. Do not go there for food. Maybe for drinks if anything."}
{"text":"This place is not listed in the phone book, there's no phone, they only take cash, and it's as small as my (former) studio apartment.  However, she manages to attract all the Madison hipsters every night to drink and eat among the aroma of the wood burning stove and the sounds of a posh dj.  I recommend the pork sammie and the Lake Louie on tap.  I'd like to be annoyed by the pretension and crowding at this place, but I just can't help but really enjoy myself every time I'm there.  Dammit."}
{"text":"Fun place if you're looking for a chill drinking spot with friends. They have local DJs in the evenings frequently. Specialty drink menu is abundant in options and originality.

However, I believe that the food is overpriced, and in all honesty, just okay as far as flavor and quality. You won't get massive portions here. In reality, they may have about 12 things to order from. Nice for those who are overwhelmed by large menus.

Also, the table spaces are tiny. The average Wisconsinite will fee a bit awkward about the size of their dinning space. You may also be waiting a while to sit as the bar seems flooded at dinner time."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have some bad memories of this place because of a person with whom I frequented this place several times. Despite this, there was much that I liked about the place. The drink menu is interesting and includes several \"off the beaten path\" drinks. When there is a live DJ, the music is very good. The major problem is that it is a small place with many patrons, so finding a seat may be difficult. Also, the rather dark atmosphere is something that could turn people off, although some people may really like it. Given the possibility of going with a different person who isn't trying to control and dictate my life, yes, I would come back again. Oh yeah, that and being able to be in Madison, which I unfortunately no longer am at this time."}
{"text":"I've passed by here many times without realizing it and I'm glad a friend told me about it to try out! Signage outside is super minimal and the space inside is intimate and cozy.

The drinks are unique and tasty, although I like em a tad stronger. My favorite was a seasonal cocktail that reflected a mulled wine. Very yummy!

The food is just as delicious. The name doesn't give away any genre of food and I would say Nate Spil has a lot of various influences and fusions like Chinese, American, and Italian. We got one of the specials of the day, a wood-fired oven pizza which was incredibly tasty.

Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Loved everything we had! Split a few dishes for apps for a small group and servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. Very unique all around. (Decorating and menu) Hints of Asian, contemporary, rustic, artsy all in one place. The food was quite good. \"Honest\" 

I loved the dumplings. The family got a pizza and loved that too. All around good find for me. \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"Maybe it's the three cup chicken (such a simple dish, but it literally haunts my dreams)? Maybe it's the stiff cocktails? Maybe it's the fact that it isn't swarming with raging college kids (no disrespect, but it's nice when you need a night to recover from typical UW debauchery)? All I know is that after spending 4 years exploring Madison, and visiting twice since graduation, Natt Spil is my go-to.

The crowd is a bit on the hipster side, but I've seen all sorts of people set up shop and feel completely comfortable here. There is no website, sign outside or phone number, which keeps the place from becoming a mob scene. The lighting is dark, the music (usually a live DJ) is loud, the atmosphere is casual but cool and well designed. Sort of an Asian-influenced speakeasy meets your uncle's log cabin up north.

The dim sum is always a good bet (like, an exceptionally good bet...), and the pizzas never disappoint. Also, the aforementioned three cup chicken just does something to me. Great food at an even better price. Some solid, super-affordable wine and beer selections, too.

I've been here on dates and with a couple of friends at a time, but wouldn't recommend it for a big group. It's more of an intimate spot. Bring cash or your ATM card, credit cards are not accepted. Lastly, the kitchen is open until pretty late (1am I believe), which rules.

And so concludes my first Yelp review. I just wanted to pour one out for my homie. Natt Spil-I miss you."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, as long as you can find the place(having no sign makes this a wee bit difficult). Dark and brooding, yet soft enough to be romantic.

They have a fun drink list, for those of us who don't do beer(although my last mojito tasted more like lime and Aquanet rather than fresh yummy goodness).

The menu is interesting, although small. Nice place to grab an appetizer and a cold beverage before a night out."}
{"text":"Good food.  Unique drinks.  Possibly the best ambience in Madison.  Great DJs.  Better on the weekdays cuz it gets crowded cuz it's so narrow.  If there was more room, I'd for sure say it's my favorite bar in Madison"}
{"text":"This was my second time to Natt Spil. The first time I went, my boyfriend and I went on a date. From what I remembered, he ordered a pizza with mushroom so I wouldn't eat it (HATE mushrooms) and I had the three cup chicken. I was surprised with the amount of Asian influence, but I enjoyed it. Chris didn't like how dark it was and I how I selected tree stumps without backs for seating arrangements. Whatever, he is just not hip enough. 

When we went again, we just went for drinks. I had a super strong mojito and he just had a lame-o Tanqueray and tonic. He drank two of those really quickly, so I don't know if it was just the quality was superior to the average rail drink or it was weak. My mojito was good, but lacking on the sugar. 

I really like the atmosphere and layout of this bar. It reminds me of hipster Brooklyn with a milder hipster attitude. I would love to go again and again, but unfortunately my friends never want to wander to the Capitol bars with me."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Natt Spil, but the food was a disappointment. I will say the drinks are tasty and the space is cozy; good late night spot. Growing up eating dim sum at least once a month, it's one of my favorite cuisines. I know Natt Spil is doing more of an Asian fusion dim sum; however, everything we had was over salted. My friend and I ordered the steamed dumplings, turnip cake, and three cup chicken and both agreed there was just too much salt in everything. Aside from the salt, I did enjoy the crisp and texture of the turnip cake. The three cup chicken was decent, but not something I would order again."}
{"text":"Can not say enough good things about this place. My favorite place to go in Madison for sure!
Wish I could give it more than 5 stars. 

The menu is small, but diverse, and you truly can't go wrong with ordering anything on it. 
I like starting out with some of the dim sum options--the spicy cheese wontons are my favorite. 
If you have never been, then for entrees I recommend one person getting three cup chicken (or tofu) and another person getting the pork sandwich because both are amazing. 
Their pizzas are great too, can't go wrong there either and they have both veggie and meat offerings. Did I mention you can get a pizza with brie on it!? Um, amazing. And I almost forgot their tomato and cucumber salad is also a favorite of mine. It sounds simple, but I promise it's very good. 

And it's not just their food, they have great drinks too. If you like a spicy drink, I recommend the orange dragon. They have a wide variety of unique drinks on their menu and they house infuse some of their liquor as well (e.g. lemon grass infused vodka)

The place itself is small, cozy, and dimly lit. Many nights there is a live DJ spinning in the back. If you have a large group, be prepared to wait a little while, but it's worth it, plus you can try some of their drinks while you wait. Also be advised that it is cash only. I've never had anything but excellent service, excellent food, and excellent drinks here."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming to Natt Spil! The drinks and food I've had have been good, no complaints here, but I know I need to try the \"dim sum\". The pizza, mussels and chips and dip are fantastic.

What I love best about Natt Spil is the ambiance. I just love *being* there. Granted, I go at weird times because of my schedule-- week nights, mostly -- so I don't have to fight for a good seat.

Whether sitting at a table or the bar I feel the warmth of the red tones brought out by very, very dim lighting (and the fire from the wood burning oven!). Once my eyes adjust to the darkness, I start to notice different textures all over the place. Just look around: even the bathrooms are coated in different textures! It's truly a work of art just being there.

Practical tip: cash only."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner. Ordered the pizza special. It was awesome. Would recommend this place to anyone. It is cozy and intimate. I have eaten here many times and will eat here many more."}
{"text":"Four stars for ambience and service; not-five stars for shrimp cakes.

I'll get the negatives out of the way first. Shrimp cakes were...meh. Not terrible, but I wasn't a fan of the texture (this is more of a personal preference thing, but the cakes had whole chunks of shrimp in them, including those crunchy outer/end bits, and I like my seafood cakes smoother), or the rather one-dimensional shrimp flavor. Not bad, but not great, for me.

Hoooowever. The chips & salsa were awesome, as were the dumplings. Service, as mentioned in other reviews, really couldn't be better. The guys working were friendly without being pushy, we never had to ask for water refills or hunt them down for another drink, and they happily gave food recommendations. And the atmosphere is the best - very chill, very cozy, very authentic. Natt Spil knows what it is, and it doesn't try to be anything else."}
{"text":"Love this place. Low profile. Good place to take someone visiting from out of town. Good food, reasonable prices. Cozy and dark atmosphere. Busy and noisy. Had to wait for a table but not long and it wasn't uncomfortable. Have been here only twice. Looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Three words, three cup chicken. So great! I love the cucumber tomato side. 

All the pizzas are also delicious are reasonably priced. 

The High Tea is also good, but kind of pricey"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Tons of character, awesome food and best of all they play old school rap.  The steamed wontons are so good and the duck duck soup is amazing.  Love their wine and beers on tap.  Highly recommended.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When it's not super-crowded, Natt Spil is delightful. Tasty drinks, food that looks mouth-watering (I've only had the bacon something-or-other pizza, and it was quite good), and a good rotation of DJs. The space is dimly lit, warm, and cozy, and their tiny outdoor seating section is perfect on warm weeknights when you want to converse with a few friends while enjoying a cool beverage.

When the Natt Spil is hopping though, it's not my cup of tea. It's such a narrow building that in order to move you have to make full-body contact with everyone surrounding you as you slink through the masses - I (semi-jokingly) refer to it as Frotteur Heaven for good reason. Aside from having to get overly-friendly with your neighbors, people end up awkwardly standing in the spaces between tables and holding their drinks over diners' heads. As a clumsy lady, this makes me nervous.

So, to review: laid-back nights = awesome, crowded nights = not so much."}
{"text":"Just not all that good. Would go to Merchant or Graze 9/10 times instead."}
{"text":"Well, say what you will (and I have complained to my compatriots) about the no phone, no sign, no credit card policy, but I love Natt Spil. I tell people I hate it. I tell people it is full of hipster assclowns (which it is). When it all shakes out though the food is amazing, the beer and wine list are great, and everything is terribly reasonable on the wallet.

Chef David Oliver has a great palate and an inventive menu. The three-cup chicken is terrific and would be something I would order every time I went to any other restaurant, but it is only the second best item on the simple, delicious menu at Natt Spil. Dave's Pork Sammie is absurdly good. It is the best sandwich I've had anywhere.

Lastly, the hipster assclown population is promulgated by the tremendous DJs regularly spinning at Natt Spil. 

This is a great place to eat and a great place to grab a few drinks and listen to great music."}
{"text":"Great artisanal pizza, fun drinks, fun back room with the giant picture of the old lady smoking."}
{"text":"Me, in a rowdy pre-wedding crew: \"Can I have a Bulleit on the rocks?\"
Bartender: \"Bullet?\"
Me: \"Bullaaay? Bullet?\"
Bartender: \"Bullet.\"

Then we piled in a booth near the front to continue celebrating the evening into the morning. Natt Spil, I never remember very much from you, but what can recall is always fantastic.

See you next time!"}
{"text":"I got the 3 cup chicken, and the portions are VERY generous. Now a late and large lunch today did influence that assessment, but it is still objectively a good amount of food, and I eat a lot. I don't actually like zucchini so I took that out, but it doesn't detract from my rating. The reason I'm leaving this as a 3 instead of a 4 is because there was just too much sauce. They could have easily halved it and it would still be flavorful, but it was kind of overpowering as it was. One person told me the tofu is better than the chicken but I can't comment on that.

Keep in mind this place is cash-only and does not have a phone number (I asked) so you can't call in a to-go order."}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights

1) good food
2) slow service
3) chill (literally) ambiance

I wanted so so badly to love Natt Spil! I had heard great things from co-workers and friends and after one negative experience here years ago, I was ready to have a great experience. Sadly, this is not what happened.

We visited Natt Spil on a super cold Tuesday evening, so needless to say it was not busy at all. However, the service would not reflect that the place was 3/4 empty. My friends had gotten there about 30 mins before me and said the service had been hit or miss. I sat down and probably waited about 15 mins before getting up to find our server to take my drink order. She was at the hostess stand texting and said she would be with me in a little bit. We finally got our drinks and service was mediocre at best from there on. 

The ambiance is really dark and chill. It's kind of romantic...but it was also literally chill. Like chill to the point where I kept my winter coat on for 1/2 of the dinner. The server explained that it was an old building and they couldn't turn the heat up, which I totally get but it definitely put a damper on our experience.

I will say, I did really enjoy the food I had. Note - the menu is really small and there are 2-3 gluten free options only. However, they carry gluten free Tamari to replace the soy sauce in their signature 3 cup chicken. Oh man! It's really good, like so good I ate my leftovers the second I walked back in to my apartment.

Overall, our experience at Natt Spil was mehhhh but maybe third times the charm?!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night for dinner at 10pm on a monday night.  The menu is about 1/3 Vegetarian which was nice because the friend i was entertaining is a pescatarian.  We enjoyed delicious greek style pizza and a pitcher of octoberfest beer for $15 (Their Monday night special).  Great deal.  There was a DJ mixing solid rock music which transgressed decades. nice. 

 As you can read from other other reviews , Natt Spill has a great vibe, good crowd, and equally quality music.  Highly recommended.  especially if you want quality food late at night with vegetarian options."}
{"text":"finally checked this place out tonight (a monday) and I have to say, I was impressed. we were seated immediately and our waiter was super attentive. I might wait to go back until it cools down a little as they don't have a/c, but you really can't beat $16 for a great pizza and a pitcher... not to mention interesting atmosphere and good music playing."}
{"text":"My wife and I were invited here on what might have been the coldest night of the past winter. We parked our car and walked around the block. We didn't find the restaurant, so we walked around the next block. I don't remember how we eventually figured out that the assholes who run this place decided not to post a sign in order to be edgy or something, but I do remember that I couldn't feel any of my limbs when I finally staggered in 20 minutes late. 

Since we were so late, I assumed that everyone else had ordered, so I quickly asked the waiter for some sort of pizza when 
he came by. He sneered back, \"Maybe you should let the ladies order first.\" What an asshole-- exactly the kind of guy who works at a place without a friggin' sign. 

The pizza was fine. I won't be back to try it again."}
{"text":"Considering how roughly eight months of the year in Madison could be described as \"winter,\" it's not much of a surprise I've only been to Natt Spil when the weather was chilly and the restaurant's dark, warm, somewhat mysterious confines enticed me off the street. I've described Natt Spil to friends as \"a Leaky Cauldron incarnate;\" a pub with somewhat of an intangible mystique. (Plz excuse Harry Potter references).

Now, the promise of sipping an Oberon on a sunny summer evening could get me in the door of basically any spot in town. The perfectly spicy, tangy Three Cup Tofu and nice (albeit teensy) outdoor seating area is what drew me to Natt Spil last night and it definitely did not disappoint. My boyfriend got the Greek Goddess Love Nest pizza (feta, artichokes, olives, red peppers) and raved. My tofu was cooked to perfection (a feat rarely achieved, vegetarians/vegans can I get a hell yeah?) and came with a side of spicy tomato and cucumber salad. For those inclined chicken can be subbed in for the 'fu. Definitely staying at the top of my list for a certifiably great dinner and drink."}
{"text":"Good: Drinks.

Bad: Service, Food, atmosphere.

Not impressed at all. On a Sunday night, the service was agonizingly slow. We got waters when we sat down, but the waitress didn't come back for another 20 minutes to take our orders. \"Oh hey, I didn't want to interrupt your conversation, it looked like you were having a good time.\" Really? Maybe we were animatedly conversing about how hard it is to get a server's attention. We ordered some cocktails and food to share.

The drinks were very well mixed; between the three of us, we had the Natt Spil daquiri, the Creole Napoleon, and some other drink that had an interesting name but NO DESCRIPTION. Seriously, how are people supposed to order something to drink when they have no idea what is in it? What's in the Kingston Tingle? Rum with a dash of syphilis? Normal bars have descriptions of their drinks; I know you want to be a special snowflake but making it inconvenient to order drinks via slow service + no description doesn't really entice people to come back. 

The food we ordered took quite a while to come out, probably due to the fact that there was only one guy working the open kitchen. The shu mai was a sad travesty of what it is supposed to be. The dumpling skin was rubbery and tough, like it had been steamed too long; the sauce was a brown, gloopy mess. The filling was a lump of mystery meat. (Here's a thought, maybe you could put some more effort into describing what is on your menu! *GASP*)

The spring rolls we ordered were a) stuffed with literally the most flavorless things you could find (shredded iceberg lettuce, shredded cabbage, what appeared to be clover, tofu, and some other crap) and loosely wrapped with a sheet of rubber. Just kidding, it was rice paper that hadn't been soaked long enough. The spring rolls were ensconced on a bed of shredded lettuce and cabbage and drowned with a sweet chili sauce diluted with rice vinegar. The spring rolls were quite possibly the worst I have ever seen. Not only were they so loosely wrapped they flopped around like a limp d*ck, they had absolutely no taste and no redeeming qualities. The three cup chicken dish should be renamed \"Chicken Stir Fry That Bears No Resemblance To The Actual Three Cup Chicken Dish.\" It literally tasted like chicken stir fry you can get at the Memorial Union (except there you would save like $5 and be able to hear your friends talk, and not walk into tables because it's so  dark.) Here is a link to a great recipe for three cup chicken [http://rasamalaysia.com/three-cups-chicken-recipe/]; even if you are the worst cook and f*ck it up completely, it will probably still taste better than Natt Spil's offering.

Lastly, let's talk about the atmosphere that the pretentious hipsters that opened this place are going for. Madison Magazine described it as \"[evocative of] a Taiwanese beer hall\" (and for those of you who need a geography refresher, Taiwan is that tiny island off the coast of China), but I would describe it as \"hipster steampunk opium den.\" Seriously, there is literally a giant a** picture of a person smoking a pipe in the back room. Let's move on to their business model: no phone, no sign, cash only, terrible menu layout, dim lighting, a weird name which means absolutely nothing to most people (apparently Natt Spil = Norweigian for 'night play'),  slow service, and really, terrible food. Your menu is deliberately a \"hodgepodge\" of \"pan-global comfort food,\" but maybe you should limit yourself. Stick to what you know, and what you know apparently is NOT Asian food."}
{"text":"Great beer and cocktails options. Had an ale asylum that's not normally at places, and is a favorite.  Also had a kombucha cocktail. Very good.

Pizza and clams in kim chi were both very tasty.

On top of this, awesome art, environment and staff."}
{"text":"The above rating applies to only the issue discussed here.  On a recent return visit, I was crestfallen to learn that the DJ was using patrons as guinea pigs for his own sadistic experiment in inappropriately loud volumes of his own personal selection of garbage disguised as music.  Granted, it was around 10pm, but someone needs to exert a little quality control on the aural environment side of this venue."}
{"text":"Chef Dave, did I really see you sprinkle some MSG into my 3 cup chicken???  Please say it isn't so!  
Otherwise, this place is cozy and quaint.  No other complaints."}
{"text":"Natt Spill is fun and kind of different. I'd recommend it more for grabbing a drink and a snack than for getting a complete meal.

The vibe is kind of hip but also low key. The front looks like a somewhat nice bar and then there's a back cove area which is a little cozier. 

I didn't dislike the food, but the menu isn't exactly cohesive...pizza and Asian cuisine. We split a pizza and one of the chicken dishes and had a nice time. Definitely a plus that most items are shareable.

Overall, I give 4 stars because it's something different. Probably wouldn't go everyday, but it's a nice spot to hang out with friends when you're sick of your usual places."}
{"text":"Best food in Madison - we bring every out-of-town visitor here, and they always ask to go back.  The 3 cup tofu and hummus are outstanding, and they offer a great drink list."}
{"text":"A few of the homies have spun at this spot so I've ended up here a few times. The first was on my last day in town during one of my antic laden trips to Madison. My bro from another mo, Vincenzo dragged me here to grab a bite and somethin' to sip on and since that drunken night I've been hooked... Hi(gh)-Tea! An incredible concoction of idunnowhatthefuck that in the words of Dave Chappelle (as Samuel L. Jackson) \"GETS YOU DRUNK!\" Oh, and I forgot to mention it's tasty enough to make you wanna lick the bottom of the glass doing your best Gene Simmons impersonation (it comes in a tall glass). Don't ask me what's in this magnificent beverage. I do however know the base is a green tea liqour. I'll never forget what the bartender said when I ordered it the first time... \"You sure bro? That's got a lot of alcohol in it.\" Of course I'm sure, cousin. Haha, the hell do I look like? Oh, and the fried tofu here is pretty dece. I've had a few of their other entrees, but I can't recall what they were at the moment 'cause I shun sobriety.

Oh, and I almost forgot... This place always has DOPE music playing. ALWAYS. The DJ's that frequent this place are sick. I've heard Max Romeo over funk breaks here. Are you kidding me!? SICK."}
{"text":"I don't know what changed in a year and half, but the quality went down rather drastically. This used to be my one and only favorite destination in Madison for a while, but they're so \"out\" for me now.

My friend and I stopped over here on Wednesday bar hopping night, and everything was terrible. 

First, the service: Ok, but nothing special. And what happened to those smoking hot ladies? Why is a jersey wearing lady with zero enthusiasm serving us? Is this Wed's night thing? If so, I'll never come back. And, the terrible drinks, too. My mojito was passable while my friend's caipirinha was way below the standard. If they have the balls to charge $6-8 on a drink, I expect something good.  

I've seen this trend in Madison. If you used to be the \"it place,\" you need to keep up with the incoming competition and continue polishing the reputation rather than taking it easy by falling back on the title."}
{"text":"We went to dinner here Saturday night around 6 p.m..
 
The first thing I noticed was how dark it is inside. I'd heard that this was a great date restaurant, but given the noise level, audible conversation is difficult. The decor is eclectic, with Chinese lanterns suspended overhead, stuffed animals ( the taxidermy kind) in glass boxes, and various forms of carved and rough-hewn wood throughout. It was intimate and warm, in a way that was reminiscent of Shakey's Pizza Parlor, back in the day.

Our waitress let us know that she was new, right off the bat. Being new makes certain things excusable, but never acknowledging people, smiling or making eye contact when you are constantly passing directly by their table isn't one of them. Given the noise level, it becomes even more important to look. 

So, how was the food? Drinks were great, right? 

Uneven, and wrong.

DC really enjoyed the chips and salsa. The presentation was very appealing, with a dollop of guacamole in the center of a wide dish of salsa and plentiful, well seasoned chips. They noted an odd meat-like flavor to the guac, which they said wasn't a bad thing. I didn't try them, but those go in the win column.

The Shu Mai was a standout winner for me. Tons of fresh garlic, big chunks of pork and shrimp, wrappers toothsome and not gummy, and presented in a generous amount of sauce that was so freaking good that I poured the rest of it on my salad. WoW. At $4 per plate of three, it was also a great value. WoW. WoWiE WoW WoW. More like Dim YUM!

DC had mussels, which they said were pretty standard, average, nothing special, which given the price, they expected better. I don't like mussels, so I couldn't agree or disagree. Also the pork sandwich was reportedly just OK. Not bad, not great.

The biggest letdown was the cocktail. We both ordered the same drink which arrived basically undrinkable. I would say it was 90% rail quality rum, a couple lime wedges, and 10% ice. We sent them back to be adjusted, and when they came back ten minutes later, we could detect no adjustment. Very disappointing, but the waitress did agree not to charge us for them, when we requested that.

I'll go back, maybe to try the pizza, and will probably stick to beer next time. 

Shu Mai: 6 stars out of five. Did I mention the Shu Mai? No? Do you have a minute? Pull up a chair, actually this might take awhile."}
{"text":"Nattspill = \"night play\" in Norwegian, in case you were curious...

Even though this place can be crowded (despite its stealthy sign-less entrance), I love it.  It's dark and moody and the djs who play on the weekends are really good.  Get there a little early so you can stake out the awesome back room with tree logs as stools.  Their drinks are strong and goood, especially their mojitos.  The food is pretty good, too, especially the pizzas.  My friends are obsessed with the 3-cup chicken, but being picky and not liking dark meat, I'm not crazy about it.  

Nattspill really is a killer place to play.  Check it out."}
{"text":"It took me a while to construct this review - mostly because I forgot that I'd even tried this place. TBH, the most memorable aspect of the meal was the company of my dining companion. While there is nothing wrong with that, for a restaurant that had quite a few yelpers raving, I was disappointed.

My first impression of the place was that it was really, really dark. It took a while for my eyes to adjust to the darkness, but after they did, I was able to appreciate the oriental-inspired decor. 

While I was waiting for my friend to arrive, I ordered a Green Thumb per the recommendation of our host. It was a refreshing cocktail of cucumber juice, gin, and a splash of ginger beer. It also happened to go extremely well with the food we ordered. What a happy coincidence! 

Other than that, our meal was average...nothing spectacular and definitely nothing I would find myself craving on any given day. We ordered the shu mai and brie/apple pizza. The shu mai comes as an order of three good-sized dumplings doused in a splash of dumpling sauce. They certainly don't skimp on the shu mai ingredients, but I think it was really the dumpling sauce that did the trick. As for the pizza, I'm not a big fan of brie or apple, but together, they worked. The thin crust was a little lacking in flavor, but otherwise, it was a solid pie.

All in all, I'd say that Natt Spil isn't quite a 3, but it also is not so mediocre as to only merit 2 stars...so take that as you will!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 4 on a very busy Saturday night.  

Was this an off night?  Not sure but I am certain that one should stay away from the slender server with long dark hair.  By mid-way through dinner, I'm fairly certain I saw horns sticking out of her head.  

We were hungry and thirsty (for wine).  After waiting 15 or 20 minutes to get our bottle of wine, we ordered pretty much everything on the menu, sometimes in duplicate to serve 4.  A small cramped table doesn't lend itself well to having a half dozen different dishes strewn across it.  Leaving, quite literally, no room to put down your fork.  I asked our server nicely and early on to please slow it down. There was little to no acknowledgement of the request as dishes continued to fly out onto the table as if the restaurant was on fire.  I asked again - is this such a foreign concept?  

Pace. the. food.  It seemed a very real possibility that pizza would have to be eaten off the laps of the strangers sitting next to us if something didn't stop this convoluted culinary runaway train.  

The food, btw, ran the gamut from being ok (trumpet pizza, soups, mussels, wontons) to one very good dish (seared scallop special) to terrible (spring rolls were horrid) - to name a few.

A third request to slow the pace was met with a seriously angry server who YELLED that there was nothing she could do about it - the kitchen was pushing out dishes at this pace - period.  I'm not sure if this is typical on Planet Natt, but where I come from, your server shouldn't yell at you for ordering so much it doesn't fit on your table.  Worse yet, moments later I could see her in the midst of a total snit ranting to another server about me, in front of me!  WTF is going on here???? I'm just thankful I didn't witness her head spin all the way around, as it may have ruined the upcoming courses.   

Miraculously, the food DID stop coming out with the trajectory of a bullet towards the end of the meal, but frankly, by then the Witch of Natt had ruined the whole gig.  Overall mediocre food and service that Lucifer himself would have been proud of.  

A big bill finally arrived, notably with a dish WE NEVER GOT, which was then properly, albeit not very apologetically, adjusted.  That was the only thing \"big\" about the night.  The plates, the tables, the mind of our server and her tip were really quite small."}
{"text":"So hip, so pretensious, so eh.

Natt Spil has a lovely solid drink menu, and considering the \"atmosphere\" you're paying for it is pretty standard pricing.  I am a fan of their mojitos.   As for the food, I think the previous reviewers summed up the misses quite nicely.  Fortunately Natt Spil is located in an area where you can walk 5 blocks in almost any direction and meet up with amazing food. (so come for a drink, soak up the hip-ness, and then go eat somewhere else.)"}
{"text":"Insider tip!
(If you can't or don't read the chalkboard.)
Specials are stellar, and there's usually two. Ask about 'em.
Get 'em both.
Thank me later. 
I feel like typically there's a small plate and a 'za, although earlier last week it was a fall soup and the best egg rolls I've encountered here, pork and wild mushroom whaaaaaaa? We started with an order then ended our evening with another order. 
So ask. Or read. 
The more you know."}
{"text":"I don't really understand this place.  It seems like a cool lounge where you hang out and chat with friends, but the music is way too loud for that.  There isn't any space to dance or walk around and mingle.

I came in with a huge group, and we didn't fit anywhere.  Everyone was looking at us, we were in the way in so many different place.

We came for the coffee shot, and we all had it.  It was tasty.

They were quick to bring out our shots, and passed them all at the same time which was cool."}
{"text":"Natt Spil... it's alright.  I'm between 2 stars on it's lousy and over crowded nights, and an easy 3+ stars on the nights when it's the right size crowd, the windows are open, and I'm getting food.  So... let's break it down...

Cash only.  'Apps' is the food here, for a snack.  Beers/drinks aren't anything special, with a moderate selection.  If it's incredibly packed, don't bother with food... you'll just feel in the way.  They do serve late (not sure how late), so that's nice if it's a weekday.  Go with someone who has been there before if you can to avoid what other people mention about it being 'confusing'.  The crowd is generally very casual.

The best thing is that if you're downtown, you can 'try it out'... because if it sucks for you that night, walk somewhere else.  I'd definitely say to give it a go."}
{"text":"The only thing I dislike about Natt Spil is trying to decide between the pork Sammie and the three cup chicken. Oh and the pizza. And the Mediterranean plate. The drinks are also great. It can be a little noisy sometimes but otherwise the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"This place is the shit. Super hipster and had great drinks. The pizza is to die for and the music is awesome. If you're looking for a place off the main drag than this is it. Hope your enjoy your time."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this hole-in-the-wall after reading all the reviews for 3 cup tofu and a great bar menu, but I was terribly disappointed with the food, service, and atmosphere. The server did not hear my order of one entree apiece, so when only one came out I passed the first 3 cup tofu onto my husband while I waited for my order to be placed a second time. After a few bites of his plate I wished I hadn't ordered a second. The tofu was alright - dense, overly gingered, sweet, and oily. The cucumber salad was like a too-vinegary version of kim chee and he wouldn't eat it. We ended up with two plates of obnoxious and overly seasoned tofu and veggies. The mussels appetizers smelled like Red Tide dead fish in the Florida Keys (perhaps if we hadn't omitted the cream sauce it would have covered the foul smell) and single spring roll per $4 order was kind of puny. The waitress balked at having to provide a receipt (thanks goodness I was prepared for the cash-only policy) and then \"forgot\" that I gave her $60 instead of $40. And the music consisted of a soul mashup CD on repeat. I definitely heard the same track 3x. I enjoyed my Sazerac, and I better for $8 a pop. Overall it was a terribly  disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Natt Spil is our favorite place to stop into when we're downtown in the later hours. We stop in, have a couple of unique drinks, and take in the atmosphere of one of the hidden gems of downtown Madison.

Both the food and drink menus have unique twists on some familiar drink specialties. We love trying the new drinks out, and the infusion of heat/spicey taste (in both food AND drink) is why we keep coming back.

The atmosphere is a little tight, and when the Majestic is playing a popular show the seats can fill up quick. But overall, you'll likely be able to find a seat in Natt Spil."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite spots when I lived in town. Ambiance, food, drinks, hot bartender... Went back again and it was as good as I remembered. I really like the Mediterranean plate and their pizzas. I like the brie and apple but also the Greek goddess. And they have Ting! Love this place, but am moreso a weekday evening kinda gal, as I'm not into crowds or loud music, and it can get hairy on weekend nights."}
{"text":"Love love the mussels. It's a fantastic place to go for some late night food after work - it's always busy and the staff is very nice, which I appreciate because then I won't mind going alone and sitting at the bar. It's unique, fantastic, and one of my favorites. It never gets old and I will always return."}
{"text":"Went last week for some late night dim sum and duck soup. I won't say 'duck' twice, as it's listed on the menu as such. It seems kind of silly. I'm also the kindergartener who refused to do the Hokey Pokey. Wet blanket, that's me. ;)

The 'bartender'? He couldn't have been more of a douche if he tried. And, boy, did he not try. Inattentive- but only after reading us the specials in what almost sounded like a parody of snottiness, without letting either of us ask any questions about them. Like, really- neither of us could get a word in edgewise. Throughout our evening, he kept giving us these dismissive glances as if he was just too cool to give a shit. Finally, we got to hear all about how one of the cooks 'saved his life' after his girlfriend 'went crazy' on him over the weekend. Wow. Good thing we were almost done eating- hearing him bloviate drove us out the door pretty quick. 

I wish there were a better place to get late-night noodles in a non-hipster-bullshit atmos... 

At this point, there is only one good bartender there: the young lady with short hair. Unless she's behind the bar, I won't bother staying."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to sit down for a drink. It is dark and cozy with interesting decor and design. Also great is they have food, and really good food too (dim sum, hummus, pizza) not your typical bar stuff. It's not dirt cheap but I would not say it is expensive, just the right price for the quality. Yes, it is a bit on the hipster side but don't let the hipsters have all the fun, check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I feel like Natt Spil is what a nightclub would be like in The Shire (Middle Earth). It is all polished wood and tiny nooks and crannies with low lighting. The very reason the atmosphere is so cool however means it can feel really crowded pretty fast, so if you are at all claustrophobic you may want to stop by on a weeknight. I have always had wonderful food and cocktails each time I have visited. I also came once for a Goose Island beer pairing dinner they did which was delicious and a lot of fun. When I am in the mood for a good drink in chill setting Natt Spil is at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Favorite spot for friend meet-ups and date nights.  Their 3 Cup Tofu and cucumber tomato salad are some of my favorite dishes in Madison.  Their service is great too.  Tip: they're cash only and Industry Night on Sunday is the best time to go"}
{"text":"The three cup chicken/tofu is super delicious, as are all the pizzas. Mixed drinks are good and sometimes creative. Service is usually amazing, but occasionally it leaves something to be desired. Level of service depends more on the staff on shift than how busy the establishment is."}
{"text":"We got treated well for walking in tipsy as a party of ten late on a Monday night.  They quickly found room for us in their little alcove in the back of the restaurant.  It took too much time for the server to come, but I think they realized this and quickly made up for it. 
 The chips and salsa were a life savor.
We split 3 wood-fired pizzas; Natt Spill Sausage, Greek Goddess Love Nest, and the pepperoni and mushroom.  All Divine!
Definitely a quality choice for a beer and a pizza."}
{"text":"A downtown go-to. Wine list is well curated and bartender is knowledgeable. The 3 cup chicken never misses with tender chunks of meat fried over the flame and perfectly seasoned. Served with rice and a large helping of pickled tomatoes and peppers. Pizza specials are often unique and always yummy. Thin crust with bacon and spinach is a favorite. Bar seats at the back allow a birdseye view of the cooking.  It's like entertainment at no cost!"}
{"text":"Good food, but I can't give it any higher than 3 stars because of the weird ass music the DJs play."}
{"text":"Although the food here is pretty darn good (especially the pizza), the seating is torturous. If I wanted to sit on a painfully too-short, wobbly, wooden stool I'd be roasting s'mores over a campfire. It's just not the sort of experience I look forward to when I'm out on the town, ya know? Something tells me I'm not the only one.

I have to agree with others who have noted the awkward partitions and general layout of the place. I've never been to a place where seating and layout was such an issue, so this really put me in an odd mood. It's gotta be the antithesis of feng shui.

The atmosphere was otherwise very interesting and I think the place has potential. I just don't think I'll be adding this place to my regular haunts. If I go back, I think I'll be sure to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that many seem to rave about but I can barely tolerate. The food and drinks I have had were fine, but the pretentiousness of the patrons and the claustrophobic layout make this a place I only visit when dragged by my friends.

Being a fairly tall guy with wide shoulders, I am the quintessential bull in a china shop here. The chairs are tiny, the booths tight and constricting, and the traffic flow narrow. If you are a short, thin, pretentious type, then this is probably the ideal place to hang out. But there are much better options nearby, such as Opus or Maduro."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in the country. Incredible food, great ambiance, simple but excellent drink menu. Truly one of the greatest spots I've ever frequented."}
{"text":"I love the dark secretive feel of this place! You're enclosed by wooden furniture and mood lighting, a cool DJ and good looking chic waitstaff. 

The food is really good too- my go-to dishes: 3 Cup Chicken or the Brie and Apple Pizza...I'd top either one off with a whiskey Old Fashioned, extra cherries. One time I went there, they had an excellent Squash soup, but some of the menu is seasonal, so I haven't seen it since.

Remember, its CASH ONLY! don't be 'that guy\" scrambling through crumpled singles only to leave your date/friends waiting while you quick run to an ATM"}
{"text":"This place was fucking bullshit.  The waitress not only failed to pay attention to us, but when she did talk to us, she spoke to us about how the couple next to us gave her a shit tip. So, I decided to give her a shit tip for being completely incompetent.  Please, if you live in Madison, never visit this place.  Natt spil?  More like Natt good."}
{"text":"How hip is Nachspiel? It's so hip, it doesn't have a sign. It's so hip, it isn't even listed in the phonebook. We get it, Nachspiel. You're hip. Stop beating us over the head with it. Located right on the increasingly classy King Street, this is a cozy little bar with a slick interior design and DJ's on the weekends. However, they don't take cards. Come on, cash is so 1997."}
