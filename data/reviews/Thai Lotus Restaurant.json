{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner on Father's Day. It was very quiet in the restaurant. The construction must be keeping people away. People should overlook the construction because this is a neighborhood restaurant that needs to stay. We had Panang Curry with chicken, Spicy Sweet basil with Beef, and Pad See Ew with pork. Presentation was lovely and spiced to perfection! Next time, we will order HOT because Medium was not quite hot enough for us. Our other favorite place was Thai Rama, but this is closer and just as good. The decor/interior is nicer here too. Try it out. I bet you'll like it. A friend told me that the Chicken Larb is terrific. I'll be trying that next time for sure. Come on neighbors, keep this place going through the construction period. I would hate to see it go."}
{"text":"Our first trip on the freeway northbound on I-17 through Phoenix, we were relieved to get off at the Glendale Avenue exit and only a few blocks away, with a left turn, the restaurant was right on the corner.  Aside from a careful navigation past the construction posts, we gingerly made our way into the parking lot as we watched the afternoon sun set further to the west.  It being about 2:45pm, it was a good time for a Thai iced tea to start.  Refreshing Thai iced tea, I was ready to order the main course, yellow curry vegetable and I decided to throw in some chicken pieces.  The curry came on with a punch, and when I was seen by the waitress watering it down with the water served at our table, she kindly took the plate back to the kitchen and remade the dish to be more mild.  It still had enough kick to be satisfying to my taste.  Upon entering, you're greeted by a Buddha and flowers as you leave your woes at the door.  The chef takes care to serve authenticated Thai entrees with just the right amount of spice and flavor.  Aside from what looks like might have been windows scrubbed to remove graffiti, the daylight comes into the windows and plenty a booth inside to help the guests sit more comfortably and promotes intimate chatter.  Not expensive, this restaurant is a very delicious find.  If you do drive here, sit where you can keep an eye on your car.  And whether your drive or walk, be mindful of racing bicyclists down the sidewalks that may be difficult to see (this didn't happen on our second visit here) when you approach the exit driveway as it crosses the sidewalk."}
{"text":"Love this place, our go to for Thai. Super spicy if you one it that way!"}
{"text":"I had a very large catering order delivered for my clients and everything was perfect.  I had many special requests so I was worried they might forget something, but they didn't!  They were on time for the delivery which was impressive since it was quite a drive for them.    Food was outstanding.  I have been to many Thai places in Phoenix and this one is my favorite.. The PANANG CURRY is a  MUST.  My clients thanked me and told me this was the best lunch they have eaten in a while ( yay for me!)   The only suggestion I have is that they need to supply serving spoons and tongs(  they don't have any). Any restaurant who offers catering must have serving spoons. Fortunately for me, this office had some old ones in the kitchen that they saved from previous lunches.  Other than that, great experience.  I will definitely be ordering again soon."}
{"text":"Good, Consistent and Fast. They can spice it up too! The Green Curry is fantastic. The only issue I see is a delivery charge. Our average order is $40-50 and they still charge s delivery fee. That is why they only get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Wow...we here on a whim and were so glad we did.  The service was fantastic and the food was fresh.  Be sure to try the dessert with the Thai crepe!  I will be back! Such a great local business."}
{"text":"Best Thai ever... always fresh and delicious. Too bad it's right next to the light rail making it tough to access/see."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a Thai restaurant like this in Phoenix!  It's family run & the prices/dishes are spot on and not pretentious.  Lots of vegetarian options, and service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this restaurant on a whim, but we were very pleased with our lunch. My Pad Thai Chicken noodles ($7.95) was done perfectly and my wife's veg soup ($8.95) was more than she expected and delicious. The service was excellent and the restaurant appeared very clean, comfortable, and decorated nicely. We will be back soon to try a more adventurous dinner. And I'd like to sip on some of their imported beer. Glass of wine was only $4.95. Thai Lotus is a fun escape from the Phoenix Desert."}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant.   The service was excellent, the facility clean, and the entrees were generous and tasty.   We enjoyed the vegetarian soup and yellow curry with chicken.   There was a lot of chicken in the curry. The menu is large and has good choices for vegetarians.  The \"hotness\" to their food was just right--medium was hot, but not tear producing.   The prices were quite reasonable too."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim. The building was an ihop previously and these folks did a nice job with what they had to work with to redecorate. Hiring a carpet cleaner would be my only suggestion to improve the looks.  We were seated promptly by the friendliest little lady. We were very leery of the fact that this place was empty on a Sunday afternoon. The worthless Light-Rail is being pushed through 19th Ave and SEVERELY hinders access to the parking lot.  Anyhow, as for the food, IT WAS DELICIOUS!! And presentation was very nice. We each ordered something different in our party of three. We're not super familiar with Thai dishes, so all of the weird names were forgotten. As previously rated, the Thai iced-tea was very good -with an aftertaste of chai.  Since we were the only customers the whole visit, we were well taken care of by the hostess. She was very polite, prompt, but NOT hovering around us. We enjoyed this very much.  May not be the best Thai we've eaten, but if we want Thai without the drive, we will be coming back to Thai Lotus -especially to help support them during Light-Rail construction."}
{"text":"Favorite delivery.....could look at the special instructions i.e extra sauce, extra crispy. Also delivery charge is shenanigans......then you expect a tip when you forget? Great food, just focus!!!! Especially after an hour delivery."}
{"text":"Very good. Had the Ginger (pad khing) which was amazing. Also had silver noodle pad thai, also amazing. The Thai tea with cream was delicious also. Tried my friends panang and Thai toast which was very tasty. There wasn't one thing that disappointed.  Delivery was super fast, very friendly service. I definitely look forward to trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I don't ever write reviews. In fact this is my first. I even created an account to be able to post this. Normally I suffer in silence, but this time, I had to say something. I think this is the worst food I have ever paid to eat. I would not eat it again if THEY paid ME to eat it.   I had it delivered. It was late by 40 minutes. Not a huge deal, but kind of annoying.    The Pad Thai was cold and gummy, and the bean sprouts had wilted and were rubbery. I had to microwave it to heat it up but that did not improve the flavor at all.   The Silver Noodle soup was also cold, the noodles fell apart in my mouth and the flavor was very bland and un-appealing.   Lastly I had the 9 piece coconut shrimp. The breading was spongy, greasy and also....you guessed it, cold.   The delivery guy was completely baffled when I asked for a receipt. It seems he had never before been asked that. That might seem like I am stretching the truth a little, but I'm really not.   \"And the worst part?\" you ask. It cost exactly $40.23. For one person. I will say that the portions were quite large. But were far to revolting for me to try and choke down. I just wish I hadn't marked to tip $3.00 ahead of time when I checked out online.   I have eaten some really terrible food in my time. Trust me. But I never had to fork out $40 for it.  Please do yourself a favor and read the other reviews for the Thai Lotus. I couldn't Believe it when I saw there were no negative reviews. Then I looked closer. To me it seems these reviews are staged. I don't know allot about that kind of stuff, but some of the reviews are very Generic. Like someone just cut and pasted and then changed a few names. And then the others seem to be coming from people who know the owners.  I recommend that you take just a few more minutes and find another Thai place. This one will leave you unhappy, un-satisfied and your wallet empty."}
{"text":"I used Yelp eat24 to order food that I picked up. Let me just say- it was flawless. Picked what I wanted off the menu, set a time to be picked up, paid on the yelp app, and picked it up at that time. Perfect. Order was right, and totally ready for me when I got there. Now let's talk food. We got:  Chicken Pad Thai- delicious. Not too sweet, and plenty of chicken. We did get a rogue shrimp in ours, so if you have a shellfish allergy, be very specific. Chicken Pad Se Eu (sp?)- wonderful flavor, flat noodles were pretty broken. Might be better if ordering at the restraunt fresh, not letting it sit in take-out Yellow Curry with Chicken- really great! Not too oily, and tasted like it should! Chicken Panang- effing delicious. I'm usually a yellow curry girl through and through, but this might just take the cake. Flavor, texture, everything- sooooo good. The only warning I would make would be we got it medium spicy, and I thought my lips were going to fall off. But the flavor was still so delicious! We'll absolutely go again!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in north central Phoenix.   Come here almost weekly and love the food and service.  Crispy noodle is the best!   They do great catering too."}
{"text":"I ordered the orange chicken the portion is small for 10 dollars, the chicken was overcooked. im never coming back here"}
{"text":"I was so excited to have a Thai place opening up in the neighborhood that I made sure the BF and I hit it up ASAP. After a few sit-down dinners and maaaaaany take out dinners, I can honestly say this is my favorite Thai restaurant.  We usually can't help but start out with some spring rolls and thai iced tea which are both always delicious. I tend to go for the yellow curry with tofu, and theirs is superb. I've also tried the pumpkin curry tofu and the orange tofu, both of which were very good. BF usually orders the spicy sweet basil and has never had anything bad to say about it. Also, the coconut ice cream and the fried banana with ice cream are ridiculously good.  I can not say enough about how good the service is. EVERY time we've gone in the servers have been very friendly and welcoming and ready to answer any questions we may have.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix I have come across so far for Thai food! Delicious curry, Pad Thai, sweet sticky rice- mango, you name it! Definitely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Love the service and the fact that they are open lunch through dinner without closing. We pick up orders to go for dinner around four thirty. Love the chicken sate. Also enjoy the spicy basil dishes and curry flavors. A locally owned business that we are happy to support. Not fancy but good food and service and quite"}
{"text":"I ordered the red curry hot. It was very hot!! Be sure to check your mouth before. The staff is super nice very south east Asia very inclusive. Get ready for family talk"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, and we love that they deliver!!   Their pad thai is one of the best pad thais we've had this side of Phoenix. Everyone is usually so nice and sweet!   I'm so glad to have them close by! This place is defined one of our favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Phoenix. Owners genuinely care about your experience. We had a family dinner there to celebrate the life of my mom. They made it special.  This building used to be the IHOP. Just so happens it was my mom's favorite place! So much better than Rooty tutti fresh and fruity!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was soooo nice and helpful.  The food was excellent!  I had the chicken Tom Yum soup in the hot pot with a side of rice noodles. It was done so well, just the right amount of salty, sour, and spicy. i also tried my friend's Panang crispy fish. I should have gotten that too, on top of my soup. It was amazeballs!  I'm not a Thai connoisseur or anything, but I've had my fair share of Thai food, and Thai Lotus is some of the best I've had.  Strong work guys."}
{"text":"I love this place. I eat here at least 3 times a month. Their green, pumpkin and panang curry are my favorite! The staff is always really kind and welcoming. Food is ready in a timely manner."}
{"text":"The service was extremely genuine , punctual , and friendly ! My food was FRESH and tasted exactly how it should .. Authentic and crispy . Love it ."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Thai Lotus! I went for a third time and plan for many more visits. The owner is sooooo awesome! She has always warmly greeted me.   The first time I visited this new restaurant in my neighborhood, i just wanted some thai tea and curry. To my welcomed surprise the thai tea was awesome! And the yellow curry was awesome as well.   On tonights visit I had takeout again this time going for the well reviewed pumpkin curry, and it was sooooooo good! Loved it!   The fresh rolls are awesome as well!   I recommend actually sitting in and dining at this restaurant, as I plan on my next visit.  The atmosphere is very nice, although new and still in process. This was formally a pancake house so with time , we will see it become a true thai house atmosphere of relaxed meals and long conversations amongst friends.   The good vibe and owner is what attracts me, as well the curry and spice.   So give it a try, you wont be disappointed. The light rail construction, seems to sway ya, but just go slow and pull in for a visit."}
{"text":"What a surprise! We were welcome as we entered the front door and positive continued through the meal. Food was fresh and nicely spiced. Let's make sure they make it past the light rail construction in this lousy location. A yummy and positive experience!"}
{"text":"Despite the light-rail works disrupting 19th Ave., the Thai Lotus felt like a quiet sanctuary away from all the hubbub. Like most Thai restaurants ... charming, gracious Thai service. We were happy to take suggestions and each was exceptional. My guest commented that Thai Lotus was the best Thai food he had, had in Phoenix. We will be back. They need your support during all the construction. Go help and enjoy. This is a place we would like to see thrive in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times. Clean and personable restaurant, with very helpful and attentive service. Extra kudos for friendly help in making (and delivering) choices for our vegan and gluten-free companion. We loved the food and service, and will be back some more. They managed to survive opening during the light rail construction, so that should tell you something. I would add that IMHO, this is an undiscovered jewel!!"}
{"text":"I have tried it a few times because I want to like it, but despite the people who run the place being very nice, but the food is just bland.  Thai food, like American food, varies from region to region.  It will never taste right though if shortcuts are made with the ingredients used.  I would take a pass on this place and go to Siam or Sala Thai instead.  tldr: nice people sub par food."}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS! The owners are very sweet and have put together an extensive menu, including Pumpkin Curry, which happens to be my favorite! It was well-balanced with the perfect amount of spice and big chunks of pumpkin. The owner was so sweet she gave me a Thai Lotus, which is kind of like an Italian Soda -- it was fantastic! I'll definitely be heading back in there soon!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit, and so my friend and I tried 3 dishes: vegetarian pad Thai (which is how I compare Thai restaurants), spicy basil noodles with beef, and pumpkin curry with chicken. They all had great flavor! I'm a light weight when it comes to spicy, but my friend can take it so we ordered the basil noodles medium spicy. I kept eating it because it tasted so good, but went through 30 oz of water or more. The pad Thai had great flavor (unlike other restaurants where I find it to be bland) but had maybe a tad bit too much vinegar.  I thoroughly enjoyed every dish but I think my favorite was the pumpkin curry.   We decided to try dessert and got the sweet sticky rice with mango and coconut milk. It was a great contrast of sweet cold mango and warm sticky rice! Definitely recommend as long as mangos are in season.   It was sad that the restaurant was pretty empty on a Friday night so I hope they survive light rail! The service was excellent and the staff very, very friendly. Price is average for a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"We were hungry and that's about the only reason we ate our food. Tasteless. Smushy vegetables. They thought the only problem was lack of stars. No, it is tasteless. Love thai food, but this doesn't qualify.  Basil duck wss tough, bony, and grizzly. Pumpkin curry had disgusting veges (frozen peas and carrots), pad see ew we sent back. Pad thai was sent as a replacement it was maybe  2 stars."}
{"text":"Got a Postmates delivery today, and with all the great reviews I was thrilled that a Thai place was finally available to deliver.  We had a big dinner order of teriyaki chicken, orange chicken, pad thai, and red curry with an order of spring rolls and Thai iced tea. Delivery by Postmates was crazy fast, even during traffic! We got our order in about a half hour, despite an original estimate of an hour.  That seemed to be the highlight. The orange chicken tasted too sweet, and the teriyaki chicken didn't seem like it had been stirfried, but boiled in runny, watery sauce. The pad thai had good flavor, but had completely congealed together in the container, the noodles overcooked. Even the rice had gone mushy.   The best item was the red curry, which was absolutely delicious. It was flavorful and a little hotter than I expected, but perfect! I would come back just for that.  Overall, disappointed after spending almost $50. Maybe dine in is better than delivery..."}
{"text":"The Papaya Salad, Pumpkin Curry and Silver Noodle Pad Thai are delicious although the pumpkin could have been cut in smaller pieces.  We will be going there again to eat or for take out.  Don't let the light rail construction get in your way of trying this restaurant.  If you like Thai food, you WILL love the food here.  I can't wait to try some of the different items that my \"go to\" Thai restaurant didn't have on their menu."}
{"text":"I was looking at my past reviews this morning and realized that this place never did respond to my email or phone call.   What a shame."}
{"text":"When I came to eat here I should have been warned by the amount of people eating in the restaurant besides my partner and I: we were the only ones in the restaurant. Despite this, our food took a long time to get prepared, the portions were smaller than other Thai places I've eaten at, the vegetables seemed undercooked and the taste was meh at best. Will not come back. If you want a great Thai restaurant (although it's far from this side of town; it's definitely worth it) check out Chanpen Thai on Baseline Rd."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and flavorful. I have been twice and unfortunately the second time I got food poisoning from the chow mein with chicken. It took me out for 3 days, so that ruined this place for me."}
{"text":"Very nice lunch!  Good food, nice portions reasonably priced. Calm tranquil environment. Loved the egg roll. Next visit I will try dessert!"}
{"text":"Fabulous foods and service. Everything we had was cooked to perfection. My sister in law had a salad that was so fresh I thought the lettuce was picked just before it hit the table. My mother in law had the special of the day which had a pumpkin sauce that was to die for. I had the spicy sweet basil veggie plate with tofu and it was outstanding. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great, amazing food! I've ordered delivery from them probably 5/6 times now and just discovered them prob not even a month ago. 1 thing I order every time is their mussels on the appetizer menu i love seeing the spices ect in the \"finished\" product. The delivery gentlemen are great as well so polite and bring my dinner in a igloo cooler/ container to keep it warm....I love trying \"independent\"restaurants and this one definitely gets a 5 star because the consistency of the quality of food I've ordered in the last month!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!! Great service great food!! The owners are so sweet they accommodated my son and his special request. Food came quickly and is the best I have found here in Phoenix. Highly recommended, clean environment however the women's bathroom needs ventilation."}
{"text":"I tried Thai Lotus for the first time today, mostly because I was able to have it delivered through Eat 24. The fact that they delivered and were on time remained almost the only good thing.   I ordered crab rangoons ($6.95), spring rolls ($2.95), and Pad Thai with seafood ($12.95).   The crab rangoons were fine. The balance of dough to filling was good. They were a little too greasy though. The spring roll was a little too greasy as well.   The Pad Thai, on the other hand, was terrible. Not only did it not have a nice, spicy (I requested medium) flavor I expect, but the overwhelming smell and taste of bad seafood made it inedible. I took out the seafood to try just the noodles, and still couldn't eat it. More tomato flavor than what I expect, but all was overshadowed by the bad seafood taste."}
{"text":"The food is good and always consistent. The staff is always friendly as well. There pad Thai is good and so is their curry. I have not had much else there but will definitely go back."}
{"text":"food was amazing had the pad thai chicken lunch special , pot stickers and the best desert i have had in a long time sweet mango sweet rice rice and coconut icecream big enough to share for 2"}
{"text":"Save your money!!!!! All the meat in our meals was OLD ( orange chicken burnt and chicken beef and pork very  very dry & stringy).Reheated food I'm sure !!!  The short hours they are open , the food should be fresh & jump off your plate !!!! Spring rolls were mushy & tasteless.  What a waste of hard earned money!!!!!!!!!! Not deserving of even 1 star!"}
{"text":"Incredible! I got a call the other day from a friend who had gone here for lunch and said it was great and that many of the employees had migrated from another Thai restaurant in the area that used to be great. Other old  favorites for Thai in Phoenix have gone downhill, so I was anxious to try this one.  It is a the old IHOP building on 19th avenue N of Glendale, and the decor hasn't changed much but they aren't officially opening for a couple more weeks. My sister and I ordered crab puffs, panang, and pad thai, and everything was AMAZING!   Our server was the best server I have had in a long time, she was very attentive and quick to fulfill our every request.  Please frequent this restaurant, if such a good business like this fails I will be very sad. Judging that they already had a fair amount of traffic, I am enthusiastic that they will succeed!"}
{"text":"Wow! So happy to have an EXCELLENT Thai restaurant so close to home!  Didn't know what to expect when entering this restaurant which opened in the old iHop building on 19th Ave, but we were greeted so warmly by all the staff.  The menu is nicely varied. We had the chicken tom yum soup (hot!) and tofu green curry (hot!) and spicy beef noodles (medium hot). Both dishes were excellent.   The prices are very reasonable and the food was delicious. We plan on going back many times and hope this place makes a go of it. Can't wait to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Love love loved this place. I've lived in the area for over a year and have been wanting to try this spot out but never got around to it. BIG MISTAKE! Excellent food and service, I'll definitely be back, probably in two or three days!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. The food is fast, delicious, and the staff are friendly. My mom and I love to visit whenever we can and have never been dissatisfied. We've sat in a few times and recently walked to place an order to go- it was fast! Not immediate of course, but we weren't sitting around for half an hour.  The construction on 19th is a bit of a pain but it is completely worth it."}
{"text":"The food was great and so was the service! The owner offered many great suggestions and the food was prepared fresh and in a timely manner. The red curry was delicious as were the potstickers. Be sure to order the coconut ice cream with sticky rice for dessert! We will be back when we are in Phoenix again. Did I mention the friendly service? These guys do it right!!"}
{"text":"The best duck ever!! And great service! They did well to take care of me and my friends for our competition in Phoenix. Really miss our waitress! Will come back soon! Kob kun kaaaaap"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Thai food! Very kind and attentive staff and owner- super kid friendly! Our kids love the chicken satay and rainbow fried rice. We order curry every time and love the SPICE! And you gotta get the sticky rice and mango dessert if it's in season. You'll thank me ;)"}
{"text":"The quality of food is not as good as other Thai restaurants in town and is more expensive than them too. Service was practically non existent. They only asked what we wanted and brought out the food. We ran out of our drinks and couldn't find ANYONE to ask for refills. Plus they took their sweet time to get us the check which was the only time we saw an employee after the food was brought out. The empty restaurant should have been a clue. Do yourself a favor and pick some place else."}
{"text":"The food at Thai Lotus is so fresh and delicious. Stop by and give it a try. You have nothing to lose but all to gain. The owner is a wonderful person who goes above and beyond to make sure your experience at Thai Lotus is top notch.  Don't let the surrounding construction zone deter you from giving it a try.  The cook takes pride in making their food tasty and very flavorful, so when you order your meal expect it to be the best ever!!!! It's like grandmas home cooked meal.... From Thailand. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is great. Authentic, friendly delivery. Food is spot on, every time. I used to order through Yelp. Guess you can't do that anymore so... I'm willing to sign up for Postmates to make it happen!"}
{"text":"I had curry,spring rolls ,orange chicken and stir fried veggies. All was delicious!!  Right amount of spice and food was flavorful. Wish it was delivered hotter in temperature though. I had heard their delivery is an hour but we had fast prompt delivery with our order. I would recommend this place. It's near all the light rail mess but if you ask for delivery you avoid the worst part of getting food!!"}
{"text":"We ordered pad Thai, beef with garlic sauce, Thai tee, shrimp fried rice, and Thai tea. Where to start. The pad Thai was the best we've had since moving to Phoenix. The sauce was perfect, not too sweet. It could have used more shrimp, (I only got one, my wife got two and the tails were still on) but the flavor was great, I didn't miss the shrimp. The shrimp fried rice was second to none, no peas( I hate them) it was flavorful unlike most you get at a Chinese restaurant. The beef with garlic sauce was good but I needed more. The Thai tea was the best I've ever had. This is now our go to place when we order Thai take out. They delivered sooner than expected and we had an hour conversation about how we found the great food we were looking for."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I took my husband here and he's super picky and he ended up loving it. We got the yellow curry and the amazing basil noodles and they were so fresh and tasted ridiculously good. Couldn't get enough. And big portions!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and they deliver! I had orange chicken lunch special that came with white rice an egg roll and a few wonton chips. Maybe the soup that suppose to come with it is only served at the restaurant. My friend let me try her Pad Thai chicken and I ate that all first because it was just that good. I will definitely try my dishes here. Also delivery was quick and must be over $20."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout food for 4 people on Christmas Eve. Everything was excellent. The owner brought our food right away and was very friendly. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"We keep this place in business. :) In all seriousness, the food is consistently good and made with high quality ingredients. All of the curries are excellent, with the tofu pumpkin curry being my personal favorite. The salmon curry is my least favorite and not nearly as good as the others. The spicy basil noodles dish (add tofu for a treat) is addictive and the vegetarian soup will feed your soul if fighting a cold. Don't be fooled by location, although I always take it to go or for delivery. All in all, delicious!!"}
{"text":"I had the Basil Duck dish. It was yummy. Wasn't so keen on how fatty the duck meat was, but then, that might just be how Duck is. Never had it prior. The dish was very tasty and plenty of food in the serving. The price was about $13 for the dish. And i asked them to make it NOT SPICY (this one comes as spicy) and they did a fantastic job of it. I tasted no spice (like hot peppers) and really enjoyed the meal. The only thing I wasn't keen on was the A/C in the corner where i was sitting, was lacking. There was a floor fan set up on a chair near our table that we pointed in my direction, which helped. It might also be due to the monsoons making it so humid everywhere. But I would definitely return to this place. Food was very good and the people were awesome, patient, and prompt."}
{"text":"We have ordered in here a couple time using Postmates. It's nothing spectacular, but its good. We have tried pad thai and fried rice. The yellow curry, too. It's always fresh but its a bit bland. For Phoenix, and working with Postmates for fast delivery- 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ordered take out, had the Pad Thai, and the Duck Curry. Duck curry was good, Pad Thai was a bit below average.  Will probably order again because it's close, but there are better places like Siam  My daughter and I call the place \"Thai-Hop\""}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! The staff here makes you want to keep coming back. They are very friendly and attentive. It's not very busy most days so parking is a breeze. It makes up for all the construction on 19th ave. the red curry and pumpkin dishes are quite the treat and a guilt free option. We also tried crab puffs that have plenty of meat and not just cream cheese. This place is a great hidden little gem!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the yellow curry takeout! [Yelp says my review is too short] So, what else would you like me to talk about? It was really hot today. 111 degrees! Whew! [Yelp still says my review is shorter than most] Well, once it hit 122 degrees here in the Valley. Back in 1990. That was REALLY hot. I didn't eat yellow curry that day.  I think I had a sub sandwich. But not at this place. In fact, this place was a completely different restaurant at the time. [Yelp now says my review is average length and that I shouldn't settle for average] RUTHLESS NEVERENDING DEMANDING YELP!"}
{"text":"Had some pretty good Thai food here. The people who work here are just the sweetest. The pad thai had lots of flavor and nuts. I think I got the lunch special, so the soup was included. It was a vegetable cabbage thing and it rocked my russian socks(we love our beets and cabbage).  The coconut ice cream  was sooooo good. I don't know if they make it or if it's from safeway, I don't care..so freakin' good."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a conference.  Six of us went to this awesome restaurant after we found it on yelp. Dang was our server, and she was very helpful. She was patient and answered all our questions. The food was wonderful.  They will prepare the food in the traditional style if you ask."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place...there are mornings I wake up and start craving it right away. If I could eat here everyday, I probably would.  I have had a handful of dishes, but my favorite is the Chicken Panang Curry. I like mine mild but I have also had it medium and the heat is still doable. The Chicken Pad Thai is also delicious. My kids like the Orange Chicken but I am not a fan. The rice can be hit or miss...sometimes it's perfect, other times it's overcooked.  I have done take out, delivery, and eaten in. Delivery is usually fairly quick...I think only once it had taken the 45 minutes that I was quoted but I usually get it much faster. The food is always steaming, super hot when it's delivered. Take out is good..I usually only wait 10 min or so. I always receive friendly service. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great place, nice service, and clean. The food was good also but not in the authentic rang but fantastic for intro to Thai food."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was fast and friendly. I had Hot Yellow Curry and yes this stuff was making me sweat just sitting there. The flavor was really good and the portions were decent."}
{"text":"Lunch was great.  The waitress was very attentive and answered questions. She stopped at the table often to make sure everything was good. I ordered the red curry with tofu and veggies. The vegetarian options were limited for lunch but the regular menu had plenty of options for all eaters.  Loved the Thai coffee. After a drank some the waitress offered to add more cream which I said yes. I knew I would need it for the curry. I asked for no heat but I knew the red curry would still be warm and the coffee helped."}
{"text":"Went here in recommendation from a fam member. For starters the service was good. The server was friendly, cordial and prompt with our order. I wasnt too pleased with the food."}
{"text":"Here on business from out of town. Found this place on Yelp and followed the reviews of others. Definitely a place I will return to.   Pumpkin curry was delicious. Try it with noodles. Prices are reasonable and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Great food (spicy basil eggplant is excellent) and very friendly staff. The owner is very sweet and makes you feel at home!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious every time.  They have unique items I've not seen at other Thai restaurants so it's pretty interesting to try the new stuff"}
{"text":"Very friendly, polite service. I tend to get my meal to go, its quick and easy. I tend to get the Pad Thai and ask for it with vegetables instead of chicken or shrimp.   Be sure to show your Valley Metro \"Metro Max\" card, it's 10% off your meal. Plus you're supporting local business during the 19th Avenue Northwest light rail expansion!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food. My go-to neighborhood Thai place."}
{"text":"I have to say that Thai Lotus is your run-of-the-mill Thai restaurant and I was not overly impressed with my pad thai. I ordered medium and it was actually very spicy. Also, the construction surrounding the restaurant was horrible and a real hassle. Not the best neighborhood nor the best food, so I'll have to pass on coming here again."}
{"text":"You guys. This Thai food plain sucks. Ordered fresh spring rolls which come with peanut sauce. Peanut sauce is unlike any other peanut sauce I've ever had. It's not..peanut-y? Seems more soy sauce-based or something. And just one lonely little sad sprig of mint wrapped in the roll. Main entree pad Thai...how do you mess this dish up? It was pretty much inedible due to lack of flavor. I think I got more \"styrofoam\" taste from the take-out container than anything else. Bland was all we could come up with. Super disappointing. Wish we could get a refund because I'm fairly confident I could whip up a more robust pad Thai dish than what we were given. Maybe a bad night in the kitchen? But won't be trying again."}
{"text":"Don't let the construction keep you away, the food and service were well worth it!!! We ordered Tom Kha soup, Pad Thi, and Thai tea. For dessert we ordered mango, coconut ice cream and sticky rice, ABSOLUTELY delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything I order here is phenomenally made! Still my favorite Thai place in town. Vegetables are not ever cooked. Noodles have great texture. They accommodate substitutions. Service is fast and polite. I've dined here several times and have never once ran into a problem here. They speak great English and even to go orders are placed correctly every time even when I ask for substitutions and accommodations.  Truly one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever been to in my whole life! That's saying a lot. I've dined at too many Thai places. This place does it right. Come here and try for yourself! I cannot say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"I have travelled around the world. The best Thai place I dined at was located in Korea and run by a Thai native. This place is close to ideal. I ordered food on Sunday, early evening. Wow! I asked for extra spicy on Eat24 iPhone app and they brought the heat! I can't feel my lips right now but that's what I asked for. Flavor was outstanding! All food was delivered fresh and hot. I got my order in less 30 minutes. This is my GO TO THAI food henceforth."}
{"text":"Place looks  very dingy.  Service  was slow . The food was very salty and rice was over cooked . I will not  go back"}
{"text":"I will give 2 starts because they deliver but I ordered pad thai not spicy at all  or flavor and I got chicken and shrimp with only 2 shrimp very bland it needs the chili or something to be able to enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is very good & the people are friendly. Try the curries and egg noodle dishes!"}
{"text":"For takeout and delivery, this is our go-to Thai place in our area. We typically get a few apps and then share two entrees, Pad Thai is usually one of them, and we rotate the other. As Pad Thai dishes go, this one is pretty damn good, and my husband loves that it comes with chicken *and* shrimp, which they will happily change to *just chicken* for me. Medium spicy is usually hotter than medium but I like it that way. Try their crab rangoons (very crispy and very full) which come with sweet and sour, and my husband loves the coconut shrimp appetizer. The shrimp app is not a huge portion for the price, but the hubby must think it's worth it for how often we add it to our order!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place!  The owner always recognizes us.  The servers are fabulous and kind.  Portions are crazy generous.  Ingredients are fresh.  We usually order Panang Curry, crab Rangoon, etc.  But recently, the owner suggested Silver Noodle Salad...Hello Amazing!  We are hooked!  Looks a little rough on the outside, but do not pass up the opportunity to enjoy a fab Thai place!"}
{"text":"I ate there today for the first time . It's owned and operated by an older couple . I got a family feel the moment I walked in the door .They are so nice and genuine . Seem like nice people.  Oh yea and the food was excellent it was out in about 10 min and delicious .."}
{"text":"This is another favorite Thai restaurant.   I have tried a lot of items on their menu and have yet to be disappointed.   I love their Thai beef stew!  I ask them to add mushrooms to it sometimes, but it's tender beef and the sauce is GREAT!   I've tried their curry,  I've tried their pad woon sen, both are very good. I like it spicy!  This place has some awesome appetizers as well. I liked the coconut shrimp and stuffed wings.   There are plenty of other items I want to try but haven't yet. Whenever I'm in the area, this is my go to place!"}
{"text":"Obsessed, as expected. It feels like I'm back in my small town, always recognized as a faithful regular. They don't even ask what I'll have to drink anymore. It's great. I could eat here every day and be fine with it. I literally almost chose an apartment complex just because it was nextdoor. Ha!"}
{"text":"I know many reviews start out just as this one is, but I can't hardly believe the 4 and 5 star reviews at this spot. On a whim, I stopped in, feeling like some veggies, I ordered up some tempura. I know, I know, tempura is fried and it sorta unqualified veggies as a healthy option, but why the heck not!  The tempura had tons of breading had to be a solid 1/2 inch thick, it was more like caked than lightly battered, I picked the batter off and ate the few veggies that tasted ok. Still on the healthy-esq kick, I went with garlic chicken sub veggies for the rice. Well, the chicken was *way overcooked, and seriously under flavored, and the veggies, the vegetables were not even palatable, think out of a can or freezer then boiled.   I didn't even dent the meal, they asked if I wanted the rest to take home... Uhh, You can keep your doggie bag, no thanks!  But the wait staff was super friendly, too bad it doesn't come close to making up for this quality of food.   Happy yelping Phoenix, hope you have a better experience than I, should you also decide to dine in."}
{"text":"Heading home to LA, the concierge at the Arizona Biltmore recommended this local Thai place. We tried the Thai toast, Tom Kha soup and green curry. All were very good and fresh. We can see why the locals patronize Thai Lotus. Dang the owner served us and what delightful with good service  too:)"}
{"text":"Customer service and food was great! Would recommend this to people that don't complain about every single thing. Food portions were great! Tom Yum was flavorful. Only thing they didn't have at the time was Sprite. Still doesn't change the stars I'm giving. Thank you for the great food and service! :)"}
{"text":"We had the Shrimp Pineapple Curry, chicken sauté with peanut sauce, fresh coconut shrimp with sweet chile sauce, cucumber salad and such a sweet lady answered the phone. It was all Fantastic!!! It was soooo good that I called just to thank her! She made some recommendations and we went with it. Real coconut, fresh basil & tomatoes! Not your typical pineapple. Much better!! Delicious!!!! Another order today. I got the Roasted Duck Curry this time. The last time I enjoyed Duck this much I was in a French restaurant! Nicely done!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!! The service is FANTASTIC! I love the pumpkin curry. It is my absolute favorite dish here. Also for starters I highly recommend the coconut shrimp.  Everything here is Bomb.com!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, great service!  The waitress was very attentive and patient with us.  The food was SO GOOD and they had plenty of options for my vegan friend."}
{"text":"Fried rice---10/10 (smoky taste was awesome!) Salmon in teriyaki sauce----8/10 ( the server kept on suggesting to get it with coconut because it was way better but my mom insisted on teriyaki) Pumpkin curry mild spice----- 10/10 (its curry with lots of vegetables, be ready to eat more rice!) Silver noodle soup-----9/10 ( a little more seasoning this would have been a 10) Orange chicken-----7/10 ( the chicken was good, citrus flavor qas definitely there but not orangy) Coconut Ice cream----8/10 ( the taste is there, its just that i tasted something way better before especially that fresh coconut part. For people not used to fresh coconut, this is an easy 10)  The place was so relaxing and quiet. Perfect after a long drive under the sun. We were there early at 6pm thursday with 2 other groups... So i dont know how it looks during busy times if they have one."}
{"text":"Wow! Next level customer service. Our waitress was so kind and attentive. All of their food was amazing, but the true shining star was their won ton soup. I think that it may have been one of the most delicious soups I've ever had. It was refreshing, flavorful with just the right amount of kick. I assure you if you try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"we decided to visit Thai lotus late on a Friday night and had a decent experience.  they didn't seem upset that we showed up 30 minutes before closing which i was nervous about.  they were just happy we were there.  we live near 19 ave and Glendale and will most likely return if we are craving Thai food and aren't downtown, as i prefer Thai basil.  the server was obviously quite green but very sweet.  the owner, as others have mentioned, was extremely kind and excited to talk with us.  she told us the same things that other reviewers mentioned and asked us to tell our friends to go in since the construction was creating a bit of a challenge.  she gave us a coupon for a free appetizer for next time.  i ordered the pumpkin curry out of curiosity and after reading a review that said the medium wasn't hot enough i decided to order it HOT.  i typically have very high tolerance of heat but, unfortunately, my curry was inedibly hot.  the owner offered to remake it for me but i tolerated as much as i could and took the rest home.  eating it the next day was no easier.  i also ordered peanut sauce on the side and, although it costs $1 extra, i will do that again when we return.  it was delicious.   my husband ordered the spicy basil noodles with HOT spiciness and felt the heat was just right and enjoyed his meal.  we also ordered Thai sausage after some encouragement from our server and enjoyed that quite a lot!  I've actually been thinking about it lately and craving the flavor."}
{"text":"In town for one night, after a long drive I just wanted some great food brought to my door. I found the Thai lotus on yelp and called to place my order. The lady on the phone was very nice and helpful, she said it would be here in 50 minutes. 50 minutes on the nose, my food was delivered by a friendly guy. The food was really good, Thai iced tea is perfection."}
{"text":"Although this is in a sketchy neighborhood it had good reviews and was close to my hotel so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I ordered the Masaman Curry Chicken.  This is one of my favorite orders from Thai restaurants when I travel so I am comparing it to many other places.  I can't comment on the service as I ordered it to go but the staff was friendly and the interior looks well maintained.  My two main issues were that the curry was watery and thin and most of all the chicken was pre-cooked from a can.  I know this because I have used it in my cooking before and I recognized the taste and consistency.  This explained the overall bland taste.  If you are not using quality ingredients then you will have sub-par results.  Look, I don't expect a place like this to be a gourmet spot but at least cook your own chicken.  In the end, it wasn't awful and it filled me up but that is about the best that can be said."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on Yelp reviews. Staff was nice but food was very disappointing. I ordered spicy basil noodles which had no flavor and was swimming in oil. Potstickers we're crunch but tasted slightly burned. I will keep looking for a Thai place to rival my old one in California."}
{"text":"Today, 3/19/16 I tried the Thai Lotus Garden Salad. The description for the topping said fried potatoes. However it came with potato chips. That was fine and I figured I would just pick them off but after mixing everything including I decided to just crush a few chips on top. The dressing was peanut based. Oh my gosh I think I found my new favorite salad from here. It was amazing. The fresh mint really brought it up a notch.  My spouse stuck with her standard pad Thai which she loved. We each had to have a Thai tea again. It is the perfect after dinner dessert."}
{"text":"Pleasant and efficient lunch service - the Thai iced tea was so fresh and fragrant!  Close to Work.  They deliver but I like being waited on hand and foot!  SUPPORT BUSINESSES TRYING TO SURVIVE CITY CONSTRUCTION!!!  Pumpkin Shrimp dish was so tasty and nicely garnished.  The shrimp were clean and plump and cooked just right!  Tried the Crispy Basil Tofu and it was tasty but next time I would add green beans or eggplant just for additional taste & texture.    Really appreciate the server bringing me my own little tray of spices and sauces since Companion was a Sissy and wanted everything Tourist-mild!"}
{"text":"They are wonderful people with amazing food but they raised the prices and 3 items is almost $40. Have come here for a few years and sad to say this is my last order."}
{"text":"What a great ran place .. We love the staff & food. I've eaten at every Thai restaurant around the valley and this place is my fav fav. The owners are always so nice to is when we dine in.. Thanks for opening your doors :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the flavors but felt the dishes were light on meat for price and heavy on onion. I would return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Great food, presentation, and friendly staff at a great price. Best Thai food in the valley!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Arizona and tried this place out! Very Yummy! I tried Chicken Panang curry and spring roll. Very nice flavors!"}
{"text":"I've ordered take out and delivery from this place so,  not sure how the done experience is but the staff has been friendly so far.  I have tried all their spa,  the coconut one is my favorite so fragrant and fresh.  I've also had their yellow currey, which was good and then the rice custard desert is something i often crave.  The Thai tea is really,  really good.  Fresh,  fragrant,  and refreshing."}
{"text":"After a second visit I feel Thai Lotus is still good enough to satisfy your Thai Cravings with their Great Big Menu and many assorted specials, seafood dishes you just don't get at most places.  This time I tried the Pumpkin Curry with Chicken. Every different Thai Place puts their own spin on this dish. The Variation I had was thin and more like Red Curry with less coconut and thinner. I liked that threw out the dish were chunks of pumpkin It was still tasty. I also liked how they made the dish colorful with the vegetables but the chicken in this dish was too dry for me to give a four star Yelp review as I'm not a fan of dry chicken no matter what kind of restaurant I'm in.  My husband had the Basil Noodles with beef. The dish had a nice flavors and the heat levels in both dishes were  good for us but the beef was dry and chewy.  Service was pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"Really solid place for food. Fresh, not greasy and very flavorful also. Great prices."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it less than one star. Ordered lunch from there yesterday. The food was cold and rubbery, and inedible. I'd forgotten that I ordered from there before and it was equally a hott mess. I will never darken their door again. What Thai restaurant screws up Pad Thai? They didn't even use the right noodles, they used over cooked congealed rice noodles...  They should have paid me to take that trash out of their restaurant. Epic FAIL!"}
{"text":"The staff here is very enthusiastic and fun. Because the space is not too large, the owner as well as the staff often welcome guests as relatives, give the customer familiar, close, and cozy feeling. The food is always tasted fresh and new, and you do not have to wait long to enjoy your meal. However, if you are allergic to nuts, you should inform your waiter, as Thai dishes usually have peanuts or cashew."}
{"text":"My husband and I return here every year when we visit our daughter. We loved the place. The owners always remember us and treat us like family. Our daughter always gets her favorite - Penang crisp fish. I got the delicious  Lava fish, catfish with a mild sauce and lots of stir fried veggies. My husband ordered the Tilapia in tamarind sauce. Beware: the fish is whole. If you request it, they will fillet it for you before serving - a very good idea. As always, it was all delicious."}
{"text":"I studied abroad in Thailand in college a decade ago and am always looking for places to help me relive that experience. This place is phenomenal. I've never had curry anywhere else that tastes so similar to what I had in Thailand. And the service is always good!   I got takeout and was holding my infant daughter and they helped me carry the food to my car. We will be back many times!"}
{"text":"Thai food is my favorite and they did not disappoint.  The crab Rangoons were fresh and the curry was spicy and flavorful. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. We will be back to try more."}
{"text":"First off some of the very best Thai food I have ever had. Great food, friendly and fast staff. Do your tastebuds a flavor and stop by! You will not be disappointed.  Try the pad Thai chicken yum!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, food, & decor. Best Thai food in the hood!! Check it out & thank me later. Spring rolls, Yellow Curry & Pad Thai were top-notch!"}
{"text":"I discovered Thai Lotus through grubhub and Eat24 (their preferred method of delivery). Each time I ordered the food was hotvand delicious. I can not tell you how many of their dishes I have ordered but I can tell you that the curries are SPICY and that I have not had a bad dish yet. As of a few days ago delivery had been my preferred way of enjoying all of their wonderful dishes.  I happened to be in the area and decided to bring my roomie there for lunch. She is glad I did and so are her husband and son. After the first stop for lunch, we had to make another one the following day. The only negatives I or my roomies have come across is that the sweet and sour chicken was tooooo sweeet on the second visit and that they serve their pepsi products from cans rather than soda fountains which can make for flat sodas.  I love this place and will until I find somewhere better. The staff is always ready to serve you hand and foot as well, gotta love being taken care of like a king!"}
{"text":"Just got lunch delivered from them.  Messed up the order a tad...only got one order of spring rolls instead of two...not the biggest deal.  We have eaten there before and had delivery from this restaurant as well.  It's been pretty good until now.  Today I just ordered simple pad thai.  It was not 'mild' as ordered AND it was too tomatoey and not thai at all.  VERY disappointing.  The chicken used in the pad thai and the satay was also mushy, soggy and flavorless.  I think mine was even prefab chicken.  I think we won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"I got the pad see ew and my friend for the orange chicken which came with fried rice that he really liked. This place was ok in my opinion. The music was probably what made the experience worse it was like lullaby trance music lol. The prices were kind of expensive as well for simple things you'll see yourself that everything seems to be $1 extra from what you would see normally at Thai restaurants- however the extra dollar doesn't mean your get more quality for your buck hence why I was disappointed. Overall, i have had better and probably wouldn't be going back. Good in dire circumstances but there's probably better options in the area."}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai Restaurant and it's incredible. I stick with my favorite, the orange chicken combo, but my husband tries different dishes.  He's tried the eggplant and said it's cooked perfectly.  This last time he tried the papaya dish, Thai hot and he loved it. We always share the sweet sticky rice for dessert.  The service is wonderful and we've never had a complaint.  They have a happy hour 3-7 M-Th. This summer we're going to try and catch one.  If you love Thai food try Thai Lotus yippy will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered thru Yelp delivery. Fast and hot when arrived! We ordered Chicken Penang ( fantastic!) orange chicken( was good but not what my daughter was used to so she wasn't crazy about it) and pad tai ( very good)  Will order again for sure!"}
{"text":"First trying Thai. Oh my goodness came back three times in just a few months. Tried the wonton soup one day with my dad. He's a big wonton fan. He loved it. Fresh basil, cilantro and a generous amount of wontons. Red curry and yellow curry is good."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday at 7:30 pm and it was closed. It was supposed to be open until 9 pm. Yes, there is construction but it is unacceptable to close early without some notification. Just lost 2 customers...will NEVER come back."}
{"text":"Waste of my money. I ordered the pad Thai with beef - The noodles were dry and the meat did not taste very good. I could not eat it."}
{"text":"So good! We got the pad see ew and hot curry. The workers were so nice and very attentive!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here through Postmates, because they were one of only four restaurants in my area offering the $2.99 delivery, so I figured why not?   I'm glad I did! I ordered the Massaman curry (medium), Thai iced tea, and Thai pudding with sticky rice. Price-wise, it was a little on the high side. $13 for the curry, and about $6 for the dessert. The curry was good, lots of flavour, though for medium heat it really made me sweat. If that was a medium, I'd hate to see how hot the REALLY hot stuff is. Thankfully, I can handle the heat, but others may not be as fortunate. So as a tip, I'd say if you only like a little bit of heat, order it mild. The fact that the chicken was essentially shredded was a little odd, but it didn't affect the flavour at all, obviously. It was just strange, as I've never had curry with shredded chicken... I'd say make the heat level a little more true to form, and throw a few more peanuts in, and it'll be truly amazing!  The Thai pudding and sticky rice was REALLY good. It was warm, the perfect texture, and tasted like home.   As far as delivery goes, they had my order ready within a few minutes of ordering, which was great!   If not for the excessive heat on a medium hot order, and the prices being a tad high, I'd have given the place 4 stars. I'll totally order from here again, and may even go check out the actual restaurant on an evening I'm not feeling lazy. :)"}
{"text":"Went here two times and ordered takeout.  Food quality was actually not that bad... the first time I went there I had a shrimp basil dish and it was actually really good. I ordered it as a Thai spicy and so the what was definitely there and it had good flavor. Price wasn't bad at all either, I think the total came out to $17ish with a Thai iced tea as well.   The second time I ordered a shrimp pad Thai, and it was just ok in my opinion. I've definitely had better but I'm not saying it sucked. Could have used a little more flavor to it and one thing I noticed was that it was a lot greasier than other pad Thai dishes I've had. This the only reason I took one star off.   I can't comment on service Bc all I did was pick up my food but everyone was super friendly in there. Prices are similar to what you would pay at Applebee's, maybe slightly less so that's fair.  Overall I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"Clearly, this place used to be a Denny's, which immediately made me think that it would be awesome if there could be such a thing as a Thai Denny's.  I don't know if that's a really good idea, or a really bad one, but whatever.  I ordered the spicy basil noodle dish (often called Pad Kee Mao in most restaurants) and I asked for it to be extra spicy.  I suspect, but cannot prove, that the staff were placing bets on how much this white boy could eat.  I ate it all.  It was delicious.  My friend ordered the chicken basil, and it was a small portion, although it was still good.  An overall positive experience.  But seriously, get on that Thai Denny's idea, that needs to happen...."}
{"text":"I ordered through Yelp and hadn't driven past here until I went to get my food today. Not real cute from the outside but the inside is fine! My food was ready in time and they were quick to get my food to me.  I was a little let down by the curry. I absolutely love pumpkin curry, I almost always order it when it's an option at Thai restaurants. Their curry fell a little flat for me. The broth was creamy and delicious, and the tofu was prepared just right, but everything else was just kind of off. It was like packed with basil. I love basil but I really don't want to eat a ton of basil leaves on a stem. Like I pulled so much freaking basil out of that. Also the pumpkin in it was kind of gross, just like super mushy and a little grainy. I was disappointed because I was excited for the pumpkin. Portion size was a bit smaller than other Thai restaurants in the area, but not significantly smaller. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great little Thai restaurant and I hope it survives the light rail construction. Most everything about the place is on par with expectations -- the menu, the service, the food, the decor -- but it is all done well. If you're thinking, \"hey, I'm in the mood for thai food.\" Then Thai Lotus is for you."}
{"text":"We love this place! The staff is very respectful and you can tell this respect extends to the entrees."}
{"text":"Four stars is slightly generous (more like 3.5).  Decor is dated and a bit shabby.  The service was fantastic and made up for the rest significantly.  I ordered the red curry chicken regular hot.  It was good, although not great.  The spice level was spot-on.  It was nice and creamy, although I would have like it a tad sweeter and a tad saltier.  The rice was perfectly sticky without being too starchy.  All-in-all, I would definitely give them another try since I have found Thai curry at many places can be a bit fickle--excellent one time and then so-so on a different occasion."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch in the rain. The pumpkin curry with shrimp was delish. The pad thai a little on the sweet side for our taste.  You can sub brown rice for $1, at least it is available! Fast friendly service. Large place. We will go back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"I am big fan of Thai food, and in phoenix this is the only place where i land up to tickle my taste buds. I generally eat hot and spicy food....which I think is rightly served at this place. I love wonton and tom kha soup....just ammazing."}
{"text":"I am extemely pleased we decided to order some thai food. It was excellent to the last bite. We will definitely order again. Thank you for the outstanding meal."}
{"text":"I had Thai Lotus for dinner tonight. I ordered the chicken panang curry with brown rice and the crab rangoon. I wish i could give them a better rating, especially since the panang curry was amazing, but the rangoon was very oily, as if the friers weren't hot enough like they had just been turned on. Plus they lacked flavor. It seemed more like cottage cheese inside in both flavor and consistency, plus the crab flavor did really come though either. I will be back, but will probably wait til a busier night."}
{"text":"this is our favorite place! honestly, we go here weekly. i'd worry about being judged but the ladies who work here are always so friendly and helpful. if you're not sure what to order or in the mood for something new, they've always got great recommendations.   and the food, oh the food! the green and red curries are so. damn. good. and they make the rice - the most boring food - into this delicious miracle. it's like a sticky cloud. a delicious sticky rice cloud.  anyway, just go here. and be happy."}
{"text":"If you're looking for your typical Asian take/out/delivery fare this place fits the bill. My boyfriend and I dined in, we split an order of crab rangoons, I got Pad See Ew, and he got Orange Chicken. No complaints here! The prices are reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Our local take-out Thai spot for work.  We get food here once a month. They are pretty friendly. The food is good, prices are fair, and the staff are always happy and smiling.  Try the Red Curry or the Spicy Rice with Beef."}
{"text":"We recently discovered this place and they are my new favorite, hands down!  We've been to all of the Thai places in the area a bunch and this one is the best.  The flavors just hit the mark.  They are really friendly also."}
{"text":"The food was so so. What I didn't like was being served lunch special fried rolls that were called spring rolls on the appetizer menu for $2.95. Not at all the cold wrapped spring rolls I have had everywhere else. Seemed like a trap to buy more expensive \"fresh rolls\" for $5.95. When I tried to send them back. She said you have to exchange them for fresh rolls. I begrudgingly left a tip I didn't want to."}
{"text":"Pasiing by the place seems like another run of the mill thai place but looks xan be decieving.Inside its elegamt and well put together.The service was amazing we were sat at a booth within seconds.The food was amazing!We got the basil duck entree,teryaki chicken entree,and coconut ice cream and fried bananas dor desert.It was delicious."}
{"text":"Like the food and atmosphere. Yum yum Came here for a date and left with some delicious left overs."}
{"text":"Ordered from this restaurant through GrubHub.  Pad Thai, Coconut Shrimp, Beef Satay, Fried App Sampler.  Terrible terrible food.  Once again Yelp failed to inform.  If you are from a larger city or are used to actual Thai cuisine steer clear.  If you are looking to start a lackluster restaurant and gain unwarranted Yelp praise apparently Phoenix is your city."}
{"text":"My family's favorite go to delivery Thai food! That orange chicken and Drunken Noodles are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm.we stopped here from the yelp reviews gave it a 4 star. Horrible. Im going  to atop trusting  yelp.  Hot wings was  recooked. The food is below  avg. The wait  staff  yes they r friendly but man we cant get  pass the recooked  chicken on all the meals. My son's  orange chicken  was chicken  jerky. My chicken  was recooked."}
{"text":"I first walked in and it was dead quiet, no customers. The decor was sparse, it stil looked like the former IHOP just different colors...I think, nothing noticably different. I stood there for about a minute waiting to be seated. Two ladies were talking nearby and another walked from the back and pointed me out. One of the women who had her back to me, turned and quickly got up. Apologizing profusly she grabbed a menu and seated me.  She offered water before I ordered, but I asked if they had Thai Iced Tea. She did and brought me a water and my Iced Tea. The Thai Iced Tea was very delicious, just ask for easy ice...so you can get more tea.  I was deciding on the Pumpkin Curry (as yelped here) and the Pineapple Shrimp Curry. Pumpkin was just a little too different so I went with Pineapple Shrimp Curry-Hot. It was good, it was nice and spicy - nose sniffling spicy, perfect! - The taste was there and I liked that they gave you a large bowl of rice with it. You can get noodles or jasmine rice for a dollar more if you desire.   After my food arrived and she gave me a few minutes, the waitress came over asking about the food and started talking with me about the Pumpkin Curry, she was really pushing it. Like she wanted to make it Thai Lotus' signature dish or something. She was also talking about how the construction isn't helping her business and to tell people if I like the food here. Just a bit too pushy for me, I had planned to Yelp about the visit anyway, but still...  PRO's -The dish was sooo filling and pretty good $12.95. Those little red and green chili's were just halved and gave it an extra kick! -Thai Iced Tea was delicious $4.00. -Service was good, she even came around with pieces of watermelon she was eating with her coworkers. \"I share, after you eat hot, this sweet.\" she explained.  CON's -The carrots and peas in the dish came out of can, FRESH would've made it perfect. -Thai Iced Tea came in a large wineglass type, but too much ice and not enough tea. -There was an ant crawling on the diveder. Not a little ant, but a LARGE-where the heck did that come from- ANT.  A roach would have totally grossed me out and ended my visit. But ants happen, it didn't bother me - just the crazy size of the thing. I pointed it out to the waitress and she quickly grabbed her boss and napkin to dispose of it. As this is closer to me house than my #1 Thai place, I'll be going here again. Maybe to try the Pumpkin Curry, but maybe sticking to the other curry's I'm familiar with."}
{"text":"I have to give this place three stars. This time for the food not the service. Consistency is the biggest issue with the food.   Let me start by saying that I have been here many times, always because it's where my friends choose to come. Personally I wouldn't go back if it were up to me.   Service is great, the owners and staff are very sweet and take very good care of their customers. They are trying to make it work in an old IHOP building. They haven't changed it at all, but it's clean. The parking lot however is a total disaster...Reminds me of the Tenderloin in San Francisco! The light rail construction has also hurt them I'm sure.    Food though is very hit or miss. I have been a little disappointed the last three visits. Many appetizers seem to be store bought instead of homemade. The entrees are decent but I have high expectations after spending months in Thailand over the past couple of years. Some things are just lacking flavor. Other things are good. Like I said, it's more about the consistency.   To be fair here are a few things that have been good there...Thai toast (one of the few that are homemade), beef noodle soup, beef salad and Thai iced tea!   I wish them the best, this place just isn't for me."}
{"text":"Come here almost weekly. EXCELLENT food and fabulous, friendly service every time. Highly recommend. :)"}
{"text":"Good! Quick and easy however the level is spicy isn't too spicy. I usually don't like spicy but in this case, it needs it for more flavor. So go up a spicy level!"}
{"text":"Visitor from NY wanted Thai food on the Monday after Xmas. What the heck was going to be open. Found this gem based on the wonderful yelpers. Absolutely deeeelicous. Duck curry cause I'm a  fan of the duck bird was off the chain. Mixed appetizers very good as well. Had a spicy salad with nuts. Washed all down with great Thai beer. Wonderful warm and helpful staff. It's a keeper."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of chicken pad Thai so I Decided to give this place a try since I was in the area. I ordered the chicken pad Thai to go. The noodles were over cooked and a quite bland. I was not impressed and will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"I have had the crispy basil tofu here a few times and it never disappoints. The fried basil just goes to show that if you fry anything, it's delicious. The curry here is nice and thick (I can't stand watery curry broths) and very flavorful. The choice of vegetables is lacking a bit (no carrots, broccoli or eggplant) but I think every Thai restaurant just puts their own twist on vegetable curry. I mainly get food delivered from here through Post Mates but the one time we ate in the actual restaurant the server was pleasant and attendant. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This has become our go to Thai place in Phoenix! Great, family run place. They are always super friendly & we have never been disappointed! We usually get the yellow curry, Tom Kah soup, and crab rangoons. The spice level is entirely up to you."}
{"text":"I had the Red Curry with chicken. I asked for it to be very hot. It wasn't the hottest thai food I've had but, my wife thinks I'm nuts with as hot as I like it. However, they did give me a chili powder they make in house that brought it up to the proper notch that I like  Overall, the food was good and flavorful. Worth the trek through the construction."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the surves  was great to definitely the best Thai restaurant a bit pricey  but worth it"}
{"text":"Hmmm such a high stars I'm not sure why , flavor is bland sorry I love authentic or Americanized Thai food but this place I can't give more than 2 :( service is good but I'm rating on the food."}
{"text":"I will never order food from here again. We ordered online red curry with seafood 14.95 and panang for 10.95. Pick up food, and she charged separately for each order, 14.03 for the red curry (1.00 cheaper) and charged 12.00 for the panang (1.00 over). When I paid for the panang she short changed me twice. We walk out to the car and she tells us that she only took 12.00 for the red curry.  We both paid with 20.00 bills, no receipts were given. She told us she needed to make sure she made her money, but got an extra 3.00! I realize that's not a lot but after the hassle she gave us, customer service is terrible and food is mediocre."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here while at a work conference near by. You can order take out via yelp too! I got the chicken curry (medium spice) lunch special. It was a good portion of curry and came with an egg roll and rice. The order was ready right on time, which was perfect since I was in a rush. Staff was kind and efficient! The location is not the best area but the food was authentic, true to spice level and was tasty."}
{"text":"This is the first place we ate after moving to phoenix,  and I was glad to find out they deliver! The food is good and the service is friendly. We went in to order takeout one time and they put us in a booth and gave us waters while we looked at the menu."}
{"text":"Food was good but smaller than normal portions. Still enough but don't assume you can feed two people off one dish. Peanut sauce had a lot of spicy oil but was actually really good, just looked a little weird. Veggies were fresh. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I get frustrated, distressed by the lack of quality ingredients used by Asian restaurants. Seafood makes up, what, 30-35% of the menu and is almost an afterthought - too small shrimp, leathery chicken and beef and Thai Rama on Camelback is now a fatality for these very reasons. And for the New Year they've raised their prices again?  Too much. For this, for boiled, leather chicken, I'm gone.  What's the Woody Allen joke-\"the food here is horrible...and such small portions!\"  So last night I went to a new Thai restaurant, Thai Lotus, 19th Ave and Glendale and it was delicious.  Absolutely delicious. And less dough.   I ordered the Penang Chicken, I'll explore more of the menu later. Good spot!"}
{"text":"The food took over a full hour to be delivered but was well worth the wait!  We had the tofu spring rolls which were gigantic and fresh. Lots of mint and well wrapped.  The eggplant with tofu was fantastic. Huge chunks of purple eggplant.   The pumpkin curry was to die for. Very hearty and delicious.  I like my food super spicy but was eating in with my dad who doesn't so we ordered everything mild. A perfect amount of spice.   Will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"It's funny, I've lived in the neighborhood for more than a year, but I didn't stop in for a meal until now. After having the chef special Panang with Fish, I wish I had stopped in much sooner! It was served fairly quickly, with a medium spiciness as I'd ordered it. The peanuty curry sauce was delicious and creamy! The ambience was quiet and calm with soothing soft music, a nice escape from the light rail construction. I like that you can eat in groups, as a couple, or solo with their IHOP-style booths (it looks like an old IHOP inside, and there were a couple of leftover IHOP logos on their window coverings). There were plenty of chef specials to choose from; I hope to try the chef's Crisp Basil Tofu another time. There was a TV for viewing in one corner of the restaurant. It seems very family-friendly, with high chairs and booster seats for the kiddos. They've even got a few toys on hand in case the kids need them for a bit. :) Bathroom was clean with a baby changing station in it. The service was great, friendly and fast. I'm definitely coming back to try other Thai favorites, like their Green Curry!"}
{"text":"VERY friendly staff. Pad Prik Khing was delicious. Beef noodle soup was the biz. Will return on our next visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star resturant. The food and service were great, but just feel it could have been better. Have no complaints about the food, it's just that. There's room for improvement, but  I will definitely not hesitate to return. Keep up the good work guys! :)"}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Had Thai iced tea with cream, Angel wings, brown rice and Panang curry. Friendly, extended their delivery a few miles for us because it was raining  and we were from out of town. Delicious food we shared, snug and dry in our hotel room."}
{"text":"Ok so I ordered the pad thai lunch special,  came with salad, fried wonton, egg roll. The taste was pretty good I liked the flavor. The portion I wish could of been alot bigger but most lunch specials r usually not that big unless its ala cart. The customer service is fair,  music is coo, food came out pretty quik after ordering it, the restaurant itself is pretty coo could use a makeover a lil. But id come again cuz I hear the curry is good so that might be my next visit.  So 3 stars for now for portions being so lil only cuz I can eat lmoa! I haven't yet to find an asian restaurant in Phoenix that is hella bomb n give big portions."}
{"text":"Hey CenPho people! ( and anyone else for that matter) Check out Thai Lotus for some fantastic Thai food and equally wonderful service. From what used to be the IHOP North of Glendale on 19th Avenue, you will find a vast selection of Thai dishes. They have a little happy hour from 4-7 We started out with the pot stickers, and ended up fighting over the last one. Drinks are reasonably priced. The Entrees we ordered were fantastic. I got the Silver Noodles with the Seafood Combination. No shortage of seafood here, squid, scallops, shrimp, mussles, catfish. My companion got the AMAZING pumpkin curry recommended by Sari. She was one of the most gracious and informative owners we have ever met, and she took the time to explain the various condiments you can add to your dishes, as well as suggestions for the next time we come in. Service was great. Both dishes and the appetizer were made with a focus on fresh and an eye on keeping it as healthy as these dishes could be, without sacrificing flavor. We will be back. No question."}
{"text":"I got Thai lotus through postmates so I was unable to see the restaurant... as far as the food, I was impressed! Pad Thai was delicious, there's a ton of it! I will be having left overs for a few days so you could defiantly share this. The lemongrass soup I was nervous about because many restaurants don't make it well but Thai lotus exceeded my expectations. It was probably the second best lemongrass soup I've ever had - second to my moms - they filled it with tons of herbs, mushrooms, and all the good stuff. I will defiantly order again or possibly dine in next time!"}
{"text":"I'm really happy to have discovered this place, and can't believe I've missed it.  Food was good, service was friendly and quick, and the sticky rice and mango were very tasty.  It will be a lot easier to reach when the light rail is done, but we went on a Sunday and had no trouble getting in and out.  Had the papaya salad, broccoli and tofu, pad Thai and Thai basil, which I think is sometimes called pad kee mao. Will go back soon!"}
{"text":"Food took forever and when it came the only thing that was good was the mango rice."}
{"text":"This is a quality Thai restaurant. I've recently tried the Phat phrik khing green beans, spicy sweet basil, and today I had the yellow curry. All were excellent. They serve cocktails and beer. One thing I noticed, the heat level is one notch lower than some other Thai restaurants.  I tried one entree at \"medium\", and it had a little bit of heat, but not as much as I expected. So now I order \"hot\". With some other Thai restaurants, if you order hot, your mouth will be on fire. But at Thai Lotus, hot has a nice pleasant burn and will make you sweat a little without getting absurdly hot. They also have extra hot, if you really like the heat. I've kept to ordering most of the classic dishes I'm familiar with, but they have a large menu with some unique items I haven't seen before. There are a lot of reasons to keep going back."}
{"text":"Won't be ordering from here again. Ordered Pad Thai with shrimp and chicken.. only received 2 pieces of shrimp and 2 pieces of thin chicken.   Noodles had no flavor and were extremely dry. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Overall it was okay. I've had better though. The delivery time was pretty accurate, came about 10 minutes earlier. The portions were small. And I didn't know we were suppose to ask for soy sauce or hot mustard, so our rice was very dry."}
{"text":"There are not many Thai restaurants in the uptown area so when my husband stumbled across this place we figured we would give it a shot. We were pleasantly surprised. The red curry with tofu was delicious with just the right amount of spice as was the pad Thai. The owner, a Thai woman, was incredibly nice and passionate about her business. We are glad they are in the neighborhood and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this place for me and some friends and I agree with some reviews but not others.    First, the delivery took a long time (1hr) but they did say it would be that long.  They did come within the hour.  I ordered the vegetable tempura and it was awful.  The veggies were mushy and they were more bread than vegetable.    I'm not a fan of Thai generally since I don't like curry nor anything spicy.  But i do like Japanese and Chinese food so i stayed with what was familiar.  I ordered their appetizer platter but it too was terrible.  it was like a plate of fried bread.  I also had their spring roll, pot stickers and Crab Ragoon.  I don't know what they call them but the spring rolls were not spring rolls were hardly spring rolls.  The pot stickers and Crab Ragoon were a hit and delicious.  For my entree i ordered sweet and sour chicken.  It was great.  The chicken was good and flavorful.  I gave them 3 stars since they delivered on time, my order was correct and my entree was great.  if they get a handle on their breadding appetizers then I think this would be a great place. I plan to actually eat at the restaurant today so I will update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered delivery from here a few times. We typically get one of the curry dishes, pot stickers, and sometimes a few spring rolls. Hits the spot when we are not wanting to go anywhere but want tasty Thai! Hot food, good flavors, and decent portions."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good - we order delivery from them about once a month. Their service is fast and friendly and the food quality is consistent. We like the curries, the tom yum soup, and the beef salad."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple friends about 3 months ago and we found a long hair in our pad Thai. Didn't go for a while and decided to go again yesterday, this time finding a sharp piece of metal in our food. They didn't even give us a discount. Never going there again."}
{"text":"The braised tofu and basil is delish.  My Mother lives close, so we frequent here quite a bit.  Well worth the effort to get here with the construction."}
{"text":"We live close, have had dine in and take out numerous times, and every time the food has been delicious, fresh, spice ordered 'medium' has been consistent and just the right amount of spice. I have relative's that are Thai, and have eaten authentic Thai food from both the southern and northern areas of Thailand, so I feel I know a little something about the tastes. For an american Thai restaurant, I have enjoyed all the dishes, appetizers, and desserts that we've had here, and we've had a lot. Personally, I love this place !! Everyone has their own tastes, so I recommend trying Thai Lotus and make your own opinion, but I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff and great prices  I will eat here when I am in the mood for Thai food"}
{"text":"Visited during the week for an early lunch. Staff was abundant and maybe that was the problem. We were the only people in the place. Offered menus to find no lunch specials ? Three staff milling around joking eventually returning to our table and after asking, a lunch menu appeared.  The price was reasonable according to the size portions. We did order the fish cakes which can be hard to find in other restaurants. The fish cakes and our food was OK but I do prefer other places much more."}
{"text":"We love thai food and thai lotus is a place we drive by all the time. Tonight we gave it a try after seeing many good reviews on yelp. It's delicious! Tom Kha soup is our go to appetizer and we were not disappointed. Coconut milk, large shrimp, and just the right amount of spice.  I loved the crispy fish with a peanut and curry sauce. Excellently blended so my tongue got a little bit of each flavor. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her yellow curry. Did I mention the very friendly staff? Well I need to. They went out of their way to welcome us and actually smiled as if they enjoyed their jobs. Pretty hard to find that these days. What a great date night at our new favorite thai restaurant. Just wish I wasn't so full because the dessert options look good too!"}
{"text":"Four of us went here today for lunch. The food was wonderfully delicious! The service was friendly and knowledgeable. The Pad Thai was great. The Thai tea was very tasty. The spicy basil noodles were good. All of us said that even though we live in Sun City, we'll be back! I think this is the best Thai restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is the second Thai restaurant in my area that I have tried, and I have to say the food here was much better, the pumpkin curry was great as was the garlic chicken.  I will definitely be ordering from here again. And they deliver!!"}
{"text":"I had red curry with beef, hot.  It was a pleasant lunch.  The young lady that took my order was very polite and it only took about 5 minutes to make. Would I grab some take-out from there again? Perhaps.  But I don't see myself going to dinner there. Unfortunately, the light rail has taken a lot of wind out of the sails of businesses along 19th Ave."}
{"text":"I was so excited as this place was \"remodeling\" an old iHop building to open this Thai restaurant. My wife and son ate there tonight and brought me one of my favorite dishes, Thai Beef Salad. When done right, its awesome. Unfortunately here it was NOT DONE RIGHT. The menus ays it has \"rice powder\" on it, but mine came with the strangest bits of what tasted like burnt broken rice. It was AWFUL. My wife and son also did not enjoy their meals. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND PASS THIS ONE BY! Oh, and BTW THAI LOTUS, DO YOU REALLY THINK ANYONE BELIEVES YOUR TWO 5 STAR REVIEWS, ONE DAY APART From \"Wes J\" & Greg L\"?   SAD"}
{"text":"This is the worst Thai food I've ever had. It's quite possibly the worst take-out I've ever had. I ordered two curries: green and massaman. Both were terrible.   Green Curry: Watery, flavorless sauce that somehow tasted like burnt pepper.  Massaman Curry: First, the potatoes were so under-cooked that I couldn't stick a steel fork in them. Second, I ordered it \"Hot\" and it came sweet and without any spice heat (my 1 year old had no problem eating it). Third, the \"sauce\" was dry. In fact, it wasn't sauce at all; they didn't add enough liquid to make it a sauce.   This meal was so bad, my wife and I just threw it out and found something in the pantry. I wish I could give this place \"0\" stars because this deserves less than 1."}
{"text":"No!!! Mediocre at best!!  VERY small portions and not the flavors you'd hope for from a 4 star rated place.  Won't repeat it!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, great satay, great pad thai, amazing coconut shrimp and red curry. Terrific service and very friendly"}
{"text":"My favorite take-out! The green curry is perfect. Thai toast is my boyfriend's favorite (order peanut sauce for this and you will be in heaven). The service is great as well. We were missing a part of our order tonight and were offered to have it delivered right away or a credit with no hesitation. Mistakes happen, but that kind of response is becoming rare and I appreciate it very much. We will order again and again."}
{"text":"Pass, we only tried it because it is closer than the place on Camelback. Tried it a couple times, won't try again. 1st, the don't accept American Express (easy to add to a merchant account, rates lower than Visa/MC rewards cards to process) and the girl said \"It is company policy\". When I suggested they add it she said \"company policy. It is right here on the togo menu\".  We ordered extra peanut sauce and cucumbers with the chicken saute. She took the order (June 28, 2013 4:30pm) but did NOT include the extra sauce we paid for. The garlic chicken: Very dry, no real sauce, cheap cuts of chicken with grizzle. The place still looks like a pancake house, difficult to get to, no atmosphere, no friendly servers (our server did not know the menu, she said we have to tell her the item number not the name). We are giving up. Tried the red curry and the yellow curry, both a waste of money without flavor. We are going to go back to the one on 15th ave and Camelback that we have visited for 10 years."}
{"text":"Thai Lotus was my very first Thai food experience, and I was very impressed. With my peanut allergy, I've been afraid to even try it, which makes my husband, who loves Thai food, very sad. He finally talked me into trying Thai Lotus and I am so glad I did.  We started with the fresh rolls and Thai coffee, very refreshing and tasty. I could have been content right there. For an entree, my husband had the Pad Thai, medium. He's been working on increasing his spice tolerance, and the heat was spot on. As for over-all flavor, he says it's best he's ever had. I had the garlic sauce beef. It looked deceptively simple, but the flavors were deep and very satisfying. We finished with the mango/sticky rice/coconut ice cream combo as suggested and it too was very tasty and a wonderfully refreshing summer dessert.  The atmosphere was laid back, the service incredibly friendly and I really appreciated the little visual touches, like the origami napkins, little curly design made out of our straw covers and the food presentation. They were happy to accommodate my allergy, and their huge menu was able to satisfy both myself (a heat wuss), and my braver husband. This place is well worth braving a little bit of light rail construction to get to, and we'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"A great surprise.  We have driven by this converted iHop several times and decided to stop in today for lunch.  What a great surprise.  The food and service were both beyond excellent.  The lunch specials had great flavors and were very reasonably priced and the service was impeccable.  We will definitely return !!"}
{"text":"Great home style food, atmosphere, staff, and delivers. Moderate price menu. The beef noodle soup is a must try."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes Thai food. Been there several times with friends and tried new dishes every time. The food is delicious and the service is great. The menu has something for everyone. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"My boss buys us lunch from here often. It is very good! They have excellent curry - green, panang, masamon are ones we get each time. They have always provided great service and delivery times. The food has great flavor. I recommend trying the pineapple fried rice and the curries I mentioned."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's because I order food later in the evenings , but my curries both times came out watery and in smaller portions than expected. Could be the cool on hand or that it's later at night, but I just stick to Thai Basil now."}
{"text":"I order delivery from here all the time--they're quick, everything has been delicious, and the delivery people are always so sweet. Today I had the Glass Noodle entree with tofu and the Spring Rolls. I've had a few of their appetizers, soups, curry entrees, and teas--all have been great!"}
{"text":"I ordered some takeout via Postmates. The Tom Yum soup was really delicious. Yum! (pun intended). The spicy basil noodle dish was good but could have been spicier and had more basil. But pretty solid.   Affordable and tasty. Would order again next time I'm in Phoenix.   To go orders: make sure to ask for silverware and napkins."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner there this evening.  I asked for the \"best thing on the menu\" and was directed to the Pumpkin Curry - definitely was a great choice!  I have not seen that on a menu in ages!  Appetizer of soup was fantastic as well - though I don't recall the Thai name, it was \"Tom...\" the one without coconut milk in order to reduce the calories a bit.  TASTY!  Staff is friendly, food is good, atmosphere is relaxing and enjoyable.  I live very close and see me returning here time and time again.  DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE LIGHTRAIL CONSTRUCTION... we need more places like this on the 19th ave corridor, so I encourage all to give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Very good curry and soup and very friendly staff. Ignore the light rail construction and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Where oh where can one go for good thai food in Phoenix? Not Thai Lotus.  My husband and I placed a simple to-go order of shrimp pad thai and chicken curry satay for lunch on a weekday.  The pad thai came a hard cold gelatinous mass of noodles that appeared to be a left over, not freshly made. It was totally inedible! The curry dish was just a few overly large chunks of chicken swimming in a  canned sauce. The best thing was the white rice.  Frozen thai entrees from the grocery store would certainly have been tastier--and cheaper.  At least the place looked clean and the employees were friendly. Can't imagine where/who all the 4 and 5 star reviews of this place are coming from."}
{"text":"Ordered take out tonight. It was my first time eating here. I will say that my order arrived on time and the delivery man was nice.   The food however, was completely forgettable. Coconut shrimp was ok--a little overly breaded--and I wouldn't go back for them. Then I had the Pad Thai. The shrimp had an odor and a really fishy taste so one bite of that was enough. The dish on the whole just didn't have much flavor and the noodles were all congealed so I actually had to cut it into bites.   If I had ordered this meal at the restaurant, I would not have sent it back, but I would not have wanted to go to the restaurant again. So since I was at home, I just didn't eat most of it...  I guess a little less than \"meh\" is my opinion."}
{"text":"In the area for business.  This place was awesome!  I've had pad tie in about 15 different states, and this was one of the best.  Service was great.  Also, random, but probably one of the best iced teas I've ever had also.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for dinner last night and it was perfect! The service and food were excellent! I ordered the red chicken curry and split an order of potstickers with a couple friends.  The server was very attentive and the food was also reasonably priced.  This is that amazing \"hole-in-the-wall\" place to bring your friends and family from out of town"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING here is amazing. It's my favorite Thai place. I get take out from here at least three times a week. Pad Thai amazing.  Pad See Ew AMAZING.  Thai Fried Rice, amazing.  Yellow curry.  You get the picture."}
{"text":"I ordered the Red curry, Pot stickers, & Orange chicken. How hard is it to make orange chicken? I mean frying it till its unrecognizable & slappin a orange slice on it & calling Orange chicken....doesn't work for me! The Potsticker were also over cooked.  The delivery was fast, that's the only reason why I gave 2 stars, that & my husband kinda liked his curry."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is delicious. Quick easy delivery, yet kind & excellent service if you choose to eat at the restaurant. They are our go-to delivery when we're too lazy to cook!"}
{"text":"Plenty of parking space, the light vegetable soup and yellow curry chicken we had for lunch were just delicious!  Nice people too.  Thanks all!"}
{"text":"My friends and I visited Phoenix for the Super Bowl week and we stumble upon this place and we really enjoyed the food. I ordered a Padthai, and the pumpkin curry was delicious. I definitely recommend this place. Plus the owner Dant is a sweetheart."}
{"text":"I got the spicy basil noodles $8.95 and spring rolls. $2.95  What I liked- Lots of decent veggies Good amount of meat Excellent service Yummy cheap spring rolls Fresh basil  What I disliked- Beef was chewy Noodles were overdone and very oily.  Happy enough with what I paid with a 20% off coupon, I think I would have been disappointed if I paid full price. The girl was very very nice that gave us our food. I will continue to drive to Yupha's in Tempe, or Sa Bai's on Indian School for my Thai fix."}
{"text":"Still 5 stars. EXCELLENT Panang Curry. Always hot and ready to go when I order take out.  Wish it was on the lunch menu but I'll continue to fork over the extra cash. :-)"}
{"text":"Good find! In Phoenix for the weekend and not feeling well so husband went to get take out. Great pumpkin curry. They are serious about their spice level. We asked for medium and that's what we got, nothing wimpy about the spice or flavors. Hope to return soon."}
{"text":"I am going to say this is my favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix. The girls here are so welcoming and so generous. They remember our faces and remember what we order as well.   The owner is so friendly and like to have small talk with us.   I get to the vegetarian Tom yum soup with veggies. Oh my goodness it is so good. Sour and spicy at the same time. It contains mushrooms, baby corn, carrots, cabbage and broccoli. And I always bring my own noodle bags to add into the hot pot while it boils.   The sweet mango and sticky rice is for dessert. It's a must!!   I'm a regular for sure."}
{"text":"My one year old was sleeping and I was hungry.  I placed a delivery order, which arrived quickly.   That's the end of my praise.  I ordered pad see ew , which had absolutely no flavor.  The noodles were mushy and falling apart and the beef was dry and flavorless.  I ordered pot stickers.  Generally, hard to mess up.  These tasted like a Sysco foods product that had been frozen too long.  The sauce that came with them had an odd barbecue flavor unlike any Thai sauce with which I'm familiar.  I also ordered crab puffs, not because I wanted them but because there was a $25 minimum order for delivery.  They reminded me of what you would get at a very cheap Chinese restaurant.  I just threw away $40 worth of food (there was a $5.99 delivery fee).  I am not happy and am wondering how my experience could be so different from so many other yelpers..."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here multiple times. Not only is the delivery quick, it is delicious and delivered by the owners. I have ordered multiple dishes from here including the pad thai, tom kha soup, yellow curry, thai iced tea, and sticky rice with coconut ice cream. I have yet to be disappointed with this restaurant. I have not been to the actual location yet but definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for some great thai food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"First time we had visited for dinner. We were impressed with their happy hour food menu which is from 3 to 7. Was able to order 4 delicious appetizers for 20$. We also got 2 entrees both curry; one yellow and one massamam. Again we were impressed with the quality and quantity of food. We will be returning. Customer service by Sarin was amazing as well."}
{"text":"This is epic!! Not only did Thai lotus have zero sense, Postmates still charged me!!  Wait! It gets better. The charge (which is typically pending) did not post till a day or two later, and I thought it was their typical \"pending\" fiasco. Nope. It went through 48 hours later and now Postmates is saying they can't do anything beyond 48 hours post order. I'm seriously in the twilight zone. Never use Postmates or Thai Lotus unless you want to pay for imaginary food!     So I attempted to order from Postmates Thai lotus for the 100th time. I've gone to Thai lotus for years and used their delivery service and Postmates numerous times. It's like talking to a brick wall each time. Don't offer \"special instructions\" option if you aren't going to read it and honor it. After numerous deliveries both Postmates and Thai Lotus' delivery guys I was lucky if I had one side order of steamed rice.   I was left with 2 plus curries and no rice. Huh?? Me being naive called Thai lotus after placing my Postmates order ensuring the 4 different special requests for steamed rice were honored or even acknowledged. Keep in mind I've been jipped several times by NO rice even after ordering dishes that accompany rice. After the second person on the phone....I was told it's actually called \"jasmine rice\" since when?  Odd considering your curry dishes say steamed rice...but I move along..after offering several times to pay the $2 charge for an extra side of rice, mind you each curry dish should have one side of rice. I was instructed to cancel my order and redo it because the clueless person on the phone couldn't grasp that a $50 order wasn't worth the $2 extra dollars and I even offered to tip $5 extra to avoid the hassle!! All she said was \"how do i get my money??\" Over and over. Umm hello,l??? open your ears. After being beyond annoyed I cancelled my order and are officially in search of a new Thai restaurant. Get a CLUE!!! No wonder why this place is on the verge of closing their doors. Arguing with me over .05 cents their cost when I offered $5, when they charge $2. Do the math. A complete joke. The only reason I gave 2 stars is they normally have good food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food! Ordered the Pad Thai (medium) and it was pretty hot anything beyond medium and I wouldn't be able to taste my food.  They played soothing music that made me want to get a massage. The reason for the four rating and not five is due to following:  After getting our food we were not acknowledged nor were our drinks filled. They past by several times and we tried to grab their attention and they kept walking by. After finishing our food they did not come to our table for about 15 minutes.   Other than that everything was good jus lacking on the service side."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Very flavorful. You can easily spend a lot of money here but it's a good place to come once-in-a-while."}
{"text":"We still love this place even though we decided to lose weight and can't eat out too much this place is still a favorite and we were so happy to come back and have absolutely great food!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  I will probably dine there once a week for a while now.  Great meals."}
{"text":"It was my first time going and I ordered for my lunch break and it wasn't the best experience.. it took forever just to get my food although I put the order in 40 min in advance. The food wasn't all that great either, maybe in the future I'll try again and hopefully get a better experience ."}
{"text":"WE LOVE THEM!!! We go once a week and have made friends with owners. They care, they make badass, authentic, fresh Thai.  You HAVE to go!"}
{"text":"Adore the service and the food here.  Lava fish is amazing, as are all appetizers and happy hour.  Totally great. The panang curry, the yellow curry, the larb... Yum as well.  The patron is super hospitable, engaging and kind.  Totally great with wheelchair access and service dog friendly! Delivery is always very nice and they work hard to time things so you get the freshest, hottest food possible.  So appreciate their work! Thank you ;)"}

{"text":"Best Thai Food in town! The orange chicken is delicious and the friendly service is simply amazing!"}
{"text":"It was DELICIOUS!  I had the sweet basil chicken (hot) and Richard had green chile (hot) and some delightful minty fresh rolls.  Wicked good."}
{"text":"A great, family-owned place that goes out of its way to please guests. This is our go-to spot for carryout Thai or a quiet meal with the fam. One of the owners, Dang, always goes above and beyond. The food is always fresh and tasty. I love supporting local businesses and highly recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"The outside of this place is very dull looking, but the inside is not bad. What I love about this place is that they have so many choices to choose from on their menu!  We got the appetizer that is a combination of most of the appetizers. It's was not good. For $10, it was a plate of fried small fried stuff. It was not appetizing at all.   My order was lava fish. It was cat fish served with bamboo shoots and veggies. My order came and the lady was putting the plate down and she accidentally tilted and it almost spilled over me. Instead, I moved so it only spilled on parts of my arm. The lady apologized and felt bad for doing that. It wasn't a deal to me because the lady was nice.   I did not expect the fish to be tiny fried pieces. I expected it to be fresh fish that they just chop and add in some pieces. But it felt like something you would get from a frozen aisle to fry. The sauce was a bit salty.   The main reason I go to Thai places is for the Thai tea."}
{"text":"They have pretty decent Thai food.  My favorite is the chow mien.  Additionally they are one of the few places around here that delivers quickly.  I also like being able to order online."}
