{"text":"Over 100 flavours of wings, $11 pitchers, awesome unpretentious wino atmosphere. If you want to get drunk for cheap and maybe eat some decently mediocre food and potentially chat up some underage bitches, Wing House is the spot."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  They have a pretty good deal EVERYDAY I think it's $8.99 for a pint and pound. It's a sketchy looking place, a little dark inside, I've had maybe 1 negative experience out of 5, but guess what? I'm still going back! It satisfies my wing fix and I don't have to pretend to watch sports.  Try the hot basil, south beach and congo bongo(?) Fries are pretty decent too!"}
{"text":"I love this place it's great. It's your typical local dive bar. It has a lot of hidden charm. Sure there are some unscrupulous characters but that's what makes it so great! The beer is cheap and the food is mediocre, so go there to sit back and relax and don't order food until after you're drunk."}
{"text":"every time I come here with someone who has no ID it doesn't matter if they are not drinking, they are not allowed to sit with you. What a dumb fucking rule.   this is a bullshit rule they made up and it makes no sense, why would I go to your shitty bar to sneak sips of flat labbatt blue to them?   I guess this place is good if you are looking for a bar fight or something, it is a total shithole, If there was a dead body slumped over at the bar you probably wouldn't notice. The place is teeming with alcoholics, dirty old guys who hang out in bars a lot (not the cool ones) and gangbanger types, What a lovely mix.  . The kid who works here is nice enough though, doesn't save anything else about the place.  I didn't even touch the food, the place looks like they have never heard of soap. Not to mention the overall vibe the place gives of \"no\" in terms of cuisine   yeah they are the only joint with really cheap booze in the hood (except for prohibition's happy hour) but still, I would rather drink in the park with my friends (still cheaper, and I can get better alcohol than the swill they sell here) as well as a lesser likelihood of getting stabbed in the park.  and there are a lot of lovely parks around here to drink in."}
{"text":"This wing/sports bar in the middle of Greek-town is an oddity.... a delicious oddity in to the world of wings and their many possible flavours. They have over 100 flavours to choose from ( http://www.wildwingsondanforth.com/flavours.html ), however where many others have failed at chicken wings is now have a good vehicle for their wacky flavours, Wild Wing has not failed here. Wild wing has exceeded. They have some pretty crazy sounding flavours, poutine, pina colada, and wasabi mayo...ECT... I was feeling adventurous and being goateed on by my zombie survivalist group that I was there with to order the peanut butter wings.  I would order these again; I got 1lb of wings (8-9 wings) with a pint of house beer for $8.99. The wings are crispy and delicious, not too much sauce and they are big wings. The peanut butter was intriguing, I was expecting a Thai style sauce but it wasn't, a bbq sauce finished with sweet peanut butter. The beer was house lager, I advise against the house lager, its pretty rough, the sort of beer you drink once you're already on the way to drunk and beer tastes like beer and you have to focus on your friends with one eye closed.   The decor is that of... well shitty sports bar the front door has a baseball bat for a handle, random sports memorabilia on the walls straight out of the 'I'm opening a sports bar catalogue'. A pool table in the back Cheers style bar in the middle. The staff appear to be family run sort of thing.  I highly recommend this place for its wings, I am currently planning wing nights with a few friends so we are able to mix and match flavours to try them all.  Worse case if you get bored there is a bouzouki lounge downstairs and you can hangout with creepy old Greek dudes listening to ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXuDYq42O8E )"}
{"text":"Why are there no more reviews? About 120 flavours of wings and I'm always happy to see the one and only best server of all time. Once in my youngin life, The Lady  found my wallet so all was good. My Danforth keepsake for almost 8 years now; always had A good time. No natter how I'm feeling, I feel a little bit like home-ish. If there's a game on, good. If the one and only pool table is availabke, A House pint & shot = $10. Within a good @5 minute walk, this is easily college-ground cheap. Outlasted other favourite places in the area. Most times, a definite delight!"}
{"text":"Ok food - sketchy clientele . A local dive bar good for sports watching, but don't expect great good. Had the wings, many choices of flavours, I had the buffalo hot, something was off on thr flavour and they were super tiny.  Also had some spring rolls, which were not freshly made and were average. Lots of beer selection. Annoyed but two different beggars coming into the bar."}
