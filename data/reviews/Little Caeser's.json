{"text":"Always pay with cash at this location!!  The dysfunctional guy who works the counter makes lots of mistakes and if you pay with a card they will recharge the correct amount and will say that you will get a credit on your card that you never get.   Watch out!!!"}
{"text":"My first pizza here was a deluxe something and not so good.  Next couple of times I have tried something more basic and it was pretty good for the price.  I have never had to wait much longer than they said it would be.  Even picking up a pretty basic one they had waiting was pretty good.   I don't expect a gourmet pizza here so when I said it wasn't to bad for the price, I take that in to consideration.  It has plenty of parking.  I like that as well as well as the enthusiastic service."}
{"text":"The manager (can't remember her name but starts with a D) and Ian always give great service and always offer to help to my car. I would know because I come several times a month. I hope they get recognized!"}

{"text":"Rude little Hispanic girl wouldn't give me her name... She was talking down to her customers, and didn't offer anyone napkins or seasoning.  No Manners at All.   Train Your Employees to Be Respectful of the People who are keeping them employed."}
{"text":"Been here a few times between 4-6 which is when all the pizzas should be hot and ready I always order the deep deep dish well again it not ready and I have been her for 10 min.
