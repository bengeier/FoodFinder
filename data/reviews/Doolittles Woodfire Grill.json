{"text":"It is Restaurant Week in Madison, so I closed my eyes and picked a restaurant.  Here on business and Doolittles was simply awesome.  The entries- Australian Sea Bass and steak were some of the best ever tasted and these words are coming from someone who has traveled all around the world!  Please check out Doolittles!  The Nirvana Chocolate dessert took us to another planet!

{"text":"Great service and food! Waiter was excellent, very knowledgeable of the entire menu leading us in the right direction. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a light bite around 3:00 and sat at the bar. Morgan known as the Morganator was very pleasant and welcoming. I ordered the Jerk Chicken Salad. Very flavorful but a little lite on the dressing which was hard to tell exactly what it was. Tasty nonetheless. 

While sitting at the bar, the manager and another employee who was called in but supposed to have the day off had an exchange about 6 feet from me. It wasn't terrible but really it should have been had in an area away from customers. 

All in all, I'll certainly come back when I'm in the area again. I certainly hope the Morganator is behind the bar when I do."}
{"text":"The chicken is good here I will give them that. But this place is quite pricy for the selections. Service is slow & in-attentive. Certainly will not be returning, don't see this one lasting here."}
{"text":"I cannot put into words how delicious those ribs were. The meat fell right off of the bone. The smell from the grill had me at hello. Great experience."}
{"text":"For dinner, I ordered a sea bass last night. As soon as the first bite, I knew that the fish in my plate wasn't sea bass as its taste, texture, and smell were all wrong.  I complained it to the waiter who didn't even deny switching.  I am giving the restaurant one star for its dishonesty."}
{"text":"I adore this place. Just opened and we enjoyed the nice weather at their outside bar. We will be going here a lot more. The owners put a ton of work and thought into this place. Love it!!! Creme brûlée :)"}
{"text":"Doolittles knows their smoke! From the salad to the chicken to the ribs to the fries - all worth bragging about. Among the best of Madison."}
{"text":"Arrived 11:15am today, order taken, 2 couples, told waitress separate checks. Took a while after finished to clear dishes, then waitress took dessert order. After about 5 minutes, waitress brought spoons, then disappeared. After about 15 minutes with no dessert, saw waitress now behind the bar. She did not look rushed or like she was urgently delivering food to anyone else. Went to bar and cancelled dessert orders and asked for checks. When checks delivered, she gave a half hearted \"sorry\" and left FOUR separate checks. Duh! Manager came over asking about service and told him of problem. He apologized and offered some kind of coupon for our next visit. I told him we would not be back. He asked \"Ever?\" and I responded \"Never.\" You'd think he would have offered to bring the desserts and comp them or comp part of the meals but only tried to lure us back with some silly coupon. If waitress was reassigned to the bar, it was her responsibility to ensure any unfilled orders from the floor were promptly completed by someone. Will not visit another Doolittles. Poor service and higher than average prices for middle of the road food."}
{"text":"You can smell the wood burning smoke from the parking lot. I ordered the BBQ ribs. Pretty good. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Decor very nice.  Wait staff nice and attentive. Food was delicious, had the roasted beet salad. Downside of visit it took a really long time to get food and it was not busy at the time I was there. They offered a free dessert for the inconvenience. I had the creme brulé which was also delicious. A big thumbs up for the food. They just need to get their routine down and work on better turn around for orders. The slow service was why only three stars, but I am sure they can turn that around. They have only been open a month.

Returned on 7/23/2014 with a group. Everyone enjoyed their food. It was very good. The service was good, wait staff friendly and attentive. The food was served in a timely manner (unlike first visit). An all around good experience.  I give them four stars. The food is a bit pricey but certainly a restaurant worth returning to."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner service was really good. I was not that impressed with the bread it was good not great but I had the walleye fingers which were Awesome and my hanger steaks was two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I received a great review from two people so I thought I'd finally try it.  Since I was going with 4 other people on a Saturday, I made reservations online.  Totally convenient!  We all got there a little early to have a drink at the bar.  The bar was big and luckily there was sitting for all of us.  I got two different drinks.  One of my fav drinks is the old fashioned.  I tried the luxardo old fashioned first.  Tasty but very potent.  I'm a big fan of cucumber drinks so I tried the cucumber margarita next.  OMG, that was delicious!  (I'm going to be recreating that this summer.). I wanted to have another but, since I didn't want to be in a drunken stupor, I refrained.  

We sat for our meal.  I really liked the atmosphere.  Nice lighting, spacious.  A few got salads which looked very fresh.  I got the chicken and wild rice soup.  It was creamy and hardy but not too thick.  I got the BBQ rotisserie chicken with fries and coleslaw.  The chicken was perfect.  The BBQ sauce was tangy and slightly sweet which was great.  Another person had the regular rotisserie and the rest got the jerked pork.  I didn't get a bite but it looked super good.  

I was pleasantly surprised by Doolittles and can't wait to go back.  Especially in the summer with their outside seating!!"}
{"text":"Came in during the lull between lunch and dinner (around 3pm) and found it rather relaxing. Ryan (our server) was attentive and helpful. I just about cried tears of joy when my buffalo wings came out and they were WHOLE chicken legs. I have nothing to complain about the fish tacos, but I think I was looking for a little more flavor. 3 limes already plated was a nice addition to the presentation. Will definitely return with the rest of my family. Skilled and friendly staff make this place an enjoyable place to be."}
{"text":"Some high highs and low lows.

Bottom line: earnest and trying, quick to make up for mistakes. One of the most important things they get right is cleanliness. After a few visits, the worst I've seen is a few crumbs on my seat before I sit down. That's about as close to perfection you can hope for in the 53704 zip code area where practically every other restaurant is often filthy. At Doolittle's, while watching all staff closely, I see lots of good practices regarding hygiene. Takumi sushi restaurant nearby is probably the cleanest, best, most reliable restaurant for miles and miles.

Back at Doolittle's the menu and food hold a lot of promise, but sometimes fails to deliver. The kitchen needs a lot of help. On my last visit, major fail from the head chef.

The worst offense was sending out a scary excuse for what was supposed to be seared tuna, part of an oddly named dish called, \"Asian Pickled Tacos.\" Who wants a pickled taco? I guess putting pea size nuggets of unseasoned, overcooked tuna on a taco shaped wonton with pickled radish is somehow asian. I have no idea where they're going with that, lol.

The fish I was served should NOT have left the kitchen on a plate; it should have left the kitchen 3 days prior, in the packaging it was delivered in, out to the dumpster. The smell and taste indicate it was far, far past freshness. It looked like it was \"seared\" in a bowl of water in a microwave for about ten minutes. If you don't have fresh fish available, you can't cook the bejeezus out of it to kill the microbes, you have to take it off the menu. This is why I think the head chef needs to be taken to the woodshed. That product should NOT have been on the inside of the building.

I've been eating sushi for almost 30 years, so I know seafood. I can purchase and prepare seared/rare fish in my home and feel safe feeding it to my 2 year old. The tuna on my plate at Doolittle's would have been passed over by an alley cat. It's a good thing the wonton taco shells and the pickled radish are amazingly delicious. 

People rave about the chicken but when my wife ordered it, it was nothing special. Bland, not dry but very average and far from what you'd expect from from rotisserie.

I'm pretty sure my pork loin had pink food coloring painted on to make it more visually appealing. I know the difference between pork that's done medium rare, with a little pink, and pork that's well done so that there is no pink. I was tasting the latter. Still decent, not way overdone, and juicy enough. The pork loin is cut across the grain into little discs. In the middle of the disc, only on the side facing up, is a pink circle. Flip the patty over, and it's all gray no pink. Cut through it, no pink. And every slice the same, with the little spot of pink. Hokey as heck. Nothing that's harmful or affecting the flavor in any way, just hokey as heck.

One of the best menu items is the appetizer, tenderloin skewers. It's one of the things that lives up to the promise of a wood fired grill. It's a generous portion of good quality beef; smoky crust on the outside and medium rare on the inside, just the way you want it. Be ready to add a little salt, but that's fine. The fried onion underneath it is crispy, delicious, not overly oily, I can easily clean the plate.

Regarding food allergies/sensitivities, huge room for improvement. That goes for the restaurant on the whole from the top corporate level down to the servers. There doesn't seem to be any sort of system in place. If there is, host and wait staff haven't been informed about it. It's incumbent upon the guest to ask about each and every minute menu item individually.

Most corporate restaurants have a clearly defined practice to address food allergies; i.e., the server will inform the chef one time and then all responsibility is handed off to the chef; or, the server will be the one responsible for having, getting and giving all the information a guest needs to make an informed decision; in some places, host staff will ask when reserving or seating if there are any food allergy issues, then passes the information along to whomever needs to know.

At Doolittle's, the guest needs to ask about every particular item and might have the server respond \"I'm not sure\" and walk away. In fairness, most times but not all they will check and inform you. But sadly, yes, sometimes you have to look them in the eye and say, \"Can you please find out?\"

Once I told them of a specific ingredient I needed to avoid, and asked specifically about menu item \"A\"; then later, with a different dish, the offending ingredient was served to me in menu item \"B\", which I did not specifically ask about, but I had informed them about my allergy when I asked about \"A\". It's as if you need to ask about every single thing that's on the menu, one by one. Cumbersome.

The minority ethnicity bussing staff is busy, dilligent. Cute, young, white girl hostesses may be busy chatting or playing with her smartphone. Par."}
{"text":"Prime Rib French Dip was delicious. I added Swiss cheese (for an up charge) which I would recommend as we are from WI. Service was at a good pace and the food was delivered quickly and hot. Nice restaurant layout and a good atmosphere. I noted that it did not get overly noises as more customers came in. We will return again when we are back in the area."}
{"text":"After reading many other reviews here I was very pleased with my experience here. Seated immediately. Fast, pleasant service. Food came fast. Had spit fire chicken and it was fall off the bone excellent. 

The music was nice and not too loud. Ambiance good. Yes you can hear conversations but what do you expect in a crowded restaurant. In no way over bearing. 

In regards to all of the comments about how Doolittle's is nice for \"the East Towne Mall area\" or for \"the 53704 zip code\" or that it's the only clean restaurant for 10 miles - those people should maybe stay where they feel they belong and leave this great restaurant for the real life people to enjoy.  

Doolittle's was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"There service and also the quality of the steak has really gone down since the last time I visited, the steak didn't taste like steak because of the choice of cooking charcoal grill,  I also asked for Parmesan on the steak and never received it and the sauce was on the burner too long because it was very unfavorable and watery. I will try to eat here one more time, if I am not satisfied I will probably not eat here again...."}
{"text":"Split-Roasted Chicken was above average but nothing to write home about. Appropriate pricing. Menu has something for everybody."}
{"text":"Walleye fingers were AWESOME! I also had the blueberry mojito made with real blueberries, which was great. 

I had the filet mignon with the gorganzola cream sauce. The sauce was phenomenal, the steak and mashed potatoes were mediocre. I've had better steaks at my local Italian bistro. 

My boyfriend had the gaucho burger, and that was amazing!

Overall, I was satisfied. The steak left something to be desired, and it definitely was not worth the price."}
{"text":"We very much enjoyed our meal last night and will definitely go back. We had two appetizers, the tenderloin skewers which were a perfect medium-accompanied by very thin and crispy fried onion threads and two dipping sauces- and beautifully presented buffalo wings with bleu cheese dressing. The wings did not come with celery sticks, but when I requested them, they were delivered to our table. A particularly nice touch were the warm, moist terry cloth hand towels. So much better than the wet paper version in a foil packet.  We shared the roasted beet salad with  rotisserie chicken, cranberries, and candied walnuts.  It was a very generous portion and we wound up taking more than half of it home, along with two of the six wings.  A small glitch that occurred was handled quickly and professionally- our server dropped a full tray with our food right next to our table. Broken plates, spilled food, lots of noise, big mess, BUT a replacement order and immediate apologies from the manager arrived very promptly. Doolittle's and their varied menu is a good addition to Madison."}
{"text":"Such good food. The service is excellent. Krissy, the manager on duty, was so polite and friendly. She gave a great suggestion on my menu item and I'm glad I got it. The Prime Rib sandwich is very tasty."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Loved the aviation theme, simple menu with great choices for lunch.  Wild rice chicken soup had great flavor and the sandwiches were excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a small get together with friends. I love the fact that they have an outdoor patio (great for when the weather is nice) that has a stocked bar as well. They are also VERY dog friendly, and I like to bring my dog to the outdoor patio to bond with friends and enjoy time with my dog.

The prices are a little much for the food quality, but you're paying more for the plating and service than for the food."}
{"text":"I went in for Thursday Happy Hour with co-workers - first time there. Great experience! We were seated at a round table - perfect for 5 - in a back room that was intimate and warm with a roaring fireplace.  The calamari was delicious, and the artichoke dip some of the best I have ever had. I couldn't stop eating the bread provided with the appetizers. 

With only 1 exception, we all got wine flights, which were the happy hour special that night. What a great way to try three wines and still be able to legally drive ;)! Try the \"Interesting whites\" - a little on the sweet side, but interesting indeed. 
 
This may be my new go-to spot for after work!"}
{"text":"Warm bread would be great! And served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. 
Tenderloin wrap lunch special was great!"}
{"text":"Doolittles is a great franchise. While the food was great, the service not so much. Which would not have been so bad had I not lived in Fargo for a short time and visited the location there 30+ times within a nine month stretch.

Will revisit the location again and hopefully have a better experience to share"}
{"text":"Been meaning to get to this place for some time as it is one of my sisters favorite places.  

The wife and daughter went, and the wife got rotisserie  BBQ chicken which she thought was quite good.  My daughter got the lemon salmon.  I tried it and it was very good but a fairly small piece of fish for the price. 

I got the rotisserie chicken sandwich which was good but not fantastic. 

Overall a nice place with great ambience with good if not superb food."}
{"text":"Their spicy Cajun pasta is good but is a mimick of something Cheesecake Factory does. It is spicier than most think. The artichoke dip is a solid choice though. I went with my colleagues and they absolutely love their buffalo wings. One person ended up getting it as his entree. People rave about this place, but honestly, I don't see it."}
{"text":"Get the Sierra Turkey ciabatta...amazing!

Service was excellent. Overall a great experience. We eat here probably once a month and have never had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"We both thought the food was fabulous: artichoke dip (plenty for 2-3), chicken wild rice soup, butternut squash soup, scallops w/mango marmalade, super juicy pork chop w/cider apple sauce, & lemon gingersnap blueberry cheesecake. 
Next time I'll ask not to sit by the kitchen viewing window area. (Others may enjoy it though.)
We made reservations for our 20 year anniversary so got right in."}
{"text":"I will definitely come back here when in the area.  The walleye was awesome, the sirloin was also really good according my friend.  Special props to the bartender Jonathon, great service."}
{"text":"Came here for Madison Burger Week and got their burger. According to the menu the burger either comes with fries, coleslaw or mashed potato but the waiter didn't even ask. When the burger came out it came with fries. The fries were not warm and fresh, it was cold and stale. Sitting fries and thr waitress didn't check up on us. Their Bacon Jalapeno Burger Jam was was good. The jam wasnt too much but I couldn't taste the jalapeno. It was kind of like a mac sauce from McDonalds. Overall \"ok\"."}
{"text":"Relaxing decor with wide-plank floors, cushy booths and plenty of space. My food was delicious. The fries are spiced with Old Bay, and I highly recommend the pork with mango chutney sandwich. Other menu items include flatbreads, ham/salmon/lamb burgers and salads. I hope this place sticks around the East side!

One gripe: really, beers (tap or bottles) listed on any menu at the table? You offer a beer flight and don't say what you have on-tap?"}
{"text":"What a joke! Sysco food at $20 a plate, wait staff that are trained to be corporate jukeboxes, and greasy managers trying to get the last penny out of your pocket. We are not the complaining type and have kids who wait tables, but after there was a small mistake our meal was interrupted not once, but five different times by a short Asian manager who should have been working in a call center, not a restaurant. It was the most annoying thing I have even been forced to be a part of, him trying to degrade the server as much as possible, and then for the icing on the cake he brought out a desert for \"free\" which I accepted. This is a standard practice, but when the waiter came with the bill it had the desert on it and I kid you not, $1 taken off a rather large bill. I didn't even say anything, this was too much and I didn't want to see the manager for a sixth time, he would have told me it was the waiters fault. I don't want to be interrupted five times in my meal by a manager asking me repetitively in an indirect way for reasons the server messed up, when it was really him messing up my meal. The original mistake was minimal, and it was this call center attitude that really pissed me off, enough to come on here and rant. I don't think a comment card justifies my experience there, and I should warn others about this place. Go to one of their neighbors, at least you know that your getting chain restaurant food, but wont have to deal with the garbage at this place. I have had better food and service at a buffet. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!"}
{"text":"Yum!!

In town for volunteer training for a regional non profit organization. Our group of 12 decided to come here for dinner. Our server was awesome! Very insightful to the menu and his recommendations for first time diners was spot on. I had the Jamaican Jerk Pork Tenderloin, served with a sweet potato hash. The pork was seasoned very well and fork tender. It was cooked to medium; I would have preferred medium well but that was an oversight on my part as I later looked at the menu, which clearly states cooked to medium. The hash was amazing! Perfectly cooked and the little extra of BBQ sauce with it was great! The hash was a mix of sweet potato, onion, red pepper, corn, and black bean. Yum!  Also tried a bite of lemon cheesecake for dessert- it was spectacular! 

I would definitely recommend this place and would return in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I've been to Doolittles several times now for lunch during the week with colleagues.  It's close enough to my work that I can take advantage of something a little nicer when the boss is treating!  I appreciate that we have never had to wait for a table, even on New Years Eve when it was much busier than normal.  All of the servers I have had have been great, some of them especially friendly.  

The menu has good options for different people.  There are interesting apps, awesome salads, really tasty sammies, and the stars of the show, their chicken dinner plates.  In case you don't know, the best thing at Doolittles is their rotisserie style chicken that is cooked over an open flame that if you get a good seat, you can watch while you eat.  It also makes the entire restaurant smell great!  During my meals with various important people from my company I've eaten the quarter chicken meal (mashed potatoes are delicious!), the roasted pear and chicken salad, and the Sierra Chicken Ciabatta sandwich.  Each one was just as delicious as the next and the chicken really is the star of the dishes it is in.  

The prices are a little higher than what I would normally want to pay for lunch (which is why I let other people take me there) but the food really is quite good.  Especially for being a chain, I've never been disappointed with my Doolittles experience!"}
{"text":"I was in Madison for business and came here for dinner with a couple colleagues after being told multiple times that Doolittle's was a great spot.  

Although we sat inside, the outdoor seating area was rather large and offered plenty of seats that were under umbrellas or in the shade.  The inside was simple and relaxed.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  I ordered with woodfire chicken, and my colleagues ordered the woodfire ribs and woodfire porkchop.  All of the entrees were really tasty and tender.  We were pleased with the beer selection as well.  Considering the amount of food (none of us were able to be members of the clean plate club), I would say that the cost is also very reasonable.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"With so many big national chain restaurants in the area, there's really no debate: Doolittle's is THE place to go! They do have several locations I guess, but they are locally owned and operated. We went in around 9 on a Saturday night. Their late deals were just starting...pretty much $1 off all drinks and half price apps. We split 4 apps: fish tacos, wings, chorizo flatbread, and walleye fingers. The walleye fingers were the best...crispy Parmesan coating served with tarter sauce.

As if everything wasn't great already, the bartender Evan provided great service. His strawberry rum basil cocktail was delicious and (I love key lime pie) his key lime pie martini with the ginger bread rim is reason enough to visit."}
{"text":"Cute inside. Music is awful. Drinks and food was so good. We ordered dessert (mudslide pie) and it took forever. When we got it, we realized why, it was still frozen. Pretty disappointing even for $5.50. We couldn't even cut through it. Guess we will get something different next time."}
{"text":"Ribs were just \"okay\" (not great but not terrible, somewhat bland and a bit fatty) and the fries were cold, soggy and lifeless. Pear & raspberry salad was tasty. Vastly overpriced for the quality of the food. Service was fine. Would not return."}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly recommended by the hotel's manager where I'm staying. 
So I get there for Happy Hour and I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio and the mango ceviche! Wow, what a great start. The ceviche was fresh and delicious. 
For the main course, I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with the rotisserie chicken. 
I was impressed on how good the food was at this restaurant. The bartender was super friendly and he took his time to explain the fan favorites from the menu! 
The next business trip I come to Madison I'm going to make this a stop. Two thumbs up! #SeñorFood"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner for the first time, they just opened last Tuesday.  I've realized that I've been here before and I realize I've been to one of the doors in Minnesota.  First I gotta say the bread that they serve dinner was absolutely fantastic ; this rosemary bread brought in from Minneapolis.  My mother who is very finicky eater who won't have many creamy sauces had the Parmesan encrusted walleye with French fries & green beans.  I have this fantastic steak with these horseradish mashed potatoes and steamed Spinach.  Had a red sauce kind of like Marsala it was fantastic.  Our waitress Holly was absolutely on cue and perfect.  One of the assistant managers came over and spoke with us and just made a few very welcome and at home.  I highly recommend this place to you and your friends and family; the wine selection beer selection is perfect too."}
{"text":"Yum! We went during an off time.  Love!  Especially the wood smoke smell from the rotisserie!  Awesome"}
{"text":"Decor and atmosphere really good. Actually a bit upscale for its Eastowne Mall location. Food was good, but not inexpensive. See photo. Ordered ribs and the walleye. Walleye  was tasty and prepared well. Was it worth $20. No, more in the area of $12-14. Service was avg.  Free wi-fi. Too early to tell how this place will fare with lower cost alternatives within earshot."}
{"text":"What a difference from Lone Oak Grill.  Bartenders friendly.  Orders accurate.  Food good.  What a concept. Thank you Doolittles."}
{"text":"Love love love!!! Hands down the best flavors around! Josh suggested the wings, they for sure didn't disappoint! I now see why they came in second at the wings competition! No dipping sauce required here! BBQ chicken, 1 word... Amazing! The smoke flavor came though like no other. Jamaican jerk pork tenderloin... A month full of flavors that one wouldn't think to combine. Definitely going home with leftovers!"}
{"text":"Un ligar elegante personas serias da gusto comer aqui sin duda la carne aperitivos riquisimos lo considero uno de mis lugares favor para volver lo recomiendo buen trato de los meceros"}
{"text":"The food is fine, but just fine and for this price go to one of the MANY MANY madison based restaurants rather than this tasty but rather passionless chain."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and got the parmesan artichoke dip, lemon scented salmon, and parmesan encrusted walleye. Overall is was ok, the food tasted like it would have been good, but it was soaking in too much oil. The dip and bread was the best part of the meal. Good service and atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Dinner at DooLittle's Restaurant was a good experience.  Doolittle's had excellent food,  a great atmosphere, and decent prices.  The presentation of appetizers and meals, and the flavor of their food, was outstanding for our dinner.   The outdoor patio and bar are nice."}
{"text":"We have been to Doolittles in the past and have had very good food.  The service was sometimes questionable but now the reverse is true.  Our server Jordon was spot on!  The food- not so much.
The artichoke dip came out sizzling but the crostini that came with it was a little soggy.
My daughter ordered the chicken, which she said was flavorful.  My husband had the steak and he said he felt it had been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile.  I ordered the salmon, which Ive had before and enjoyed, but it has now changed.  The rice pilaf had too many onions and some sort of spicy butter tomato sauce surrounded the platter and ruined the flavor of the salmon.  The 10 chunks of sweet potato were more raw than cooked.
For the price, it was a disappointment."}
{"text":"We just had to try Doolittles out and unfortunately, were less than impressed.  The decor was awesome, but the food seemed a bit pricey for what was offered.  We both had the chicken and wild rice soup, which was good and the rosemary bread was also good.  I had the chicken alfredo and although the rotisserie chicken that they used was good, I thought the meal fell flat.  Additionally, we were served by Darius who is either a horrible server or for some reason did not like us from the time we were sat.  We waited and waited and waited some more while the restaurant was not busy.  Someone else brought us our food (no spoon with the pasta of course) and never asked us if we needed anything else.  Darius finally came over quite a while later to check on our food.  We actually waited as long as it took us to eat.  I hope if you do try this place, that you get a much better server.  As for us, we probably won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Was a little apprehensive to check this place out based on other reviews, but I'm glad we did.

I'll start out by saying I am anything but a food snob. It seems a lot of people were quick to call the food here bland or unoriginal, and I'm not sure what they are used to or what their standards are, but I completely disagree. The menu is absolutely refreshing, with lamb and calamari jumping out at me at first glance. We got calamari for an appetizer and it was delicious. It's served with lemon and tarter sauce. The lemon added a nice zest, and paired with the flavor of the calamari itself was perfect. The tarter sauce was a nice little topping on a few bites, but ultimately unnecessary, and this is coming from someone who drenches their deep fried fish in the stuff. 

We both ordered the prime rib sandwich, I wanted to explore the menu, but it sounded too good to resist. I definitely didn't regret my choice, but it was good, not amazing. I got the side of fries which were cooked perfectly and my sister got a salad instead of potato which she said was really good. 

Service was decent. Our waiter wasn't overly friendly, but definitely not rude. My sister asked for a table with enough room for my nephews car seat to fit and the hostess sat us at a table big enough for 6. 

Overall, perfectly pleasant lunch with tasty food."}
{"text":"Meh. Food was fine.  People watching was great!  Service was good,  nice pour of wine.  Food doesn't shine.  One step above Applebees or Fridays."}
{"text":"The Sirloin and Ravioli was fabulous.  Just the right amount of protein and pasta.  The Sirloin was marinaded in a wine sauce so it really gave the beef a hearty taste.  The portobello and spinach ravioli was fabulous.  I really thought it wasn't too heavy."}
{"text":"Came for lunch during work, and we were in and out in under an hour. Service was good and the atmosphere was nice. All of us had salads, I went with the Cobb. The chicken was delicious and there was lots of it. The bread & butter at the table was also a nice touch. What could have been better? They used a mountain of iceburg/romaine lettuce in the salad, some of which was brown. And, the tomatoes had to have been flown in from somewhere in South America because they were flavorless. In Wisconsin during the summer, that's unacceptable. I know, not all restaurants use fresh, local produce, but around here it's not that uncommon. We'll come back and next time I'll probably stick to the chicken."}
{"text":"Overpriced! 
$20 for the same chicken dinner KFC sells for $5 (and KFC's potatoes and cole slaw are better).
Plus when i buy a $20 dinner i expect a salad included.
Good service, good wine list, great atmosphere, but the ribs were leathery, not fall off the bone. 
OVERPRICED !!!"}
{"text":"I've been there several times for lunch and each time the food has been good, and I've always had a quick turnaround.  The last time I was in and out in 20 minutes when I didn't order apps."}
{"text":"The service was great and we loved the outdoor seating area. A glass of wine and an evening by the fire made for a fun evening out. Their appetizers and great no matter what you get and the bartender did a great job with the drinks"}
{"text":"Favorite American restaurant in Madison! Buffalo wings and fish Tacos are fantastic! Usually great service."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here since they opened and lately their service has gotten so much worse.  Today we chose to sit outside because there are not many decent days left this year.  It took at least 15-20 minutes after we ordered appz and drinks to even get our water and 1 beer.  Our food, which was just a chicken sandwich and seared ahi-tuna took way too long for just a couple sandwiches.  The place wasnt even busy on a Sunday at 2:30pm."}
{"text":"First time visitors. We were a group of 7 adults who greatly enjoyed outdoor dining on a Saturday evening. Satisfying server named Marty. He allowed us to relax and enjoy the dining experience. Everyone's meals were great. several of us had salads made with their tasty grilled chicken. Veggies very fresh, flavorful dressings. People also really liked the walleye fingers and prime rib sandwiches. Great wine and cocktail selection. Blueberry mojito was a fave. We even shared dessert of chocolate volcano-that was slightly underwhelming-could have been warmer/moister but still satisfied the sweet tooth. When in town, we will be back!"}
{"text":"The décor was nice but the acoustics make the restaurant very loud. A tray of wet glasses was on our table when we were seated and the hostess removed them leaving the table wet that she didn't wipe down.  The menu was wet with Coke spilled all over it. We wiped everything down ourselves. Not a good first impression.
The waitress was friendly. She brought our drinks but didn't bring the bread basket until the second time around. The Rosemary bread was very good but tiny slices about 1/4 inch thick.My husband had to ask for more. Two meals a pasta dish and pork chop dinner were very good but the crab and shrimp stuffed Talapia was not as expected and not very flavorful. It came with about 1 1/2 cups of Kale- that's a lot of Kale. Probably would have been better to eliminate the Kale and serve this dinner with a small dinner salad. 
The worst part of the evening  was a table of misbehaved children sitting next to us. The kids were running around and playing with the drapes and screaming. Some parents just don't care if their kids are annoying  and being rude to other guests. This is not a restaurant for young kids. The hostess should have seen we were four adults dressed up (dress shirt and tie) for a special evening and sat us at a table away from rowdy children. There are many excellent restaurants in Madison. You have to be amazing in one way or another for me to return. Not amazing."}
{"text":"Doolittle's Woodfire Grill is overpriced, but tasty. It's location, near East Towne Mall, is a little peculiar given the high prices.

I had the Rotisserie Chicken Sandwich ($10.75) which was delicious. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes, which were also very good. My companions were mostly pleased with their meals, which included the French Dip, Applewood Bacon and Smoked Cheddar Burger and Walleye Fingers. The burger was average, but I was told the Walleye Fingers and French Dip were quite good. One of us ordered the Chopped Thai Salad, and was underwhelmed. Some of the promised ingredients were either missing or barely there. If you list cilantro and pineapple as ingredients, make sure it's on the plate! At $11.50, a salad should be absolutely perfect.

Our server's name was Carrie, and she was fantastic. Drinks were promptly refilled and she was very sweet and accommodating. Our food came out relatively fast, and there were no mishaps at all.

The interior is spacious and modern, and there is a large outside patio area. The patio even has it's own bar, which is unique for Madison. I like that the patio wraps around the building, providing both sunny and shaded seating options.

Overall, it was a good experience. But given that it's a chain and the prices are so high, it's hard to recommend. I guess if you are looking for something new, you can't go wrong, especially on the far east side and its plethora of chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good. I've been there before and had the Cobb salad and it was excellent. If I go there again that's what I'll have. 
This time I had the rib and chicken combo. The smoky flavor was good. The meat was tender and fall off the bone. The sauce was on the ribs only and it had no kick. Just meh. It comes with seasoned frys and cole slaw. Frys were good. Forgot my slaw and when I asked for it got it promptly but it tasted like mayo and cabbage no seasoning. 
My husband got the porkchop dinner and gave me a taste. It was dry and no smoky flavor with a bland unexplainable taste. Not good. Came with a mixed vegetable that looked over cooked. Soggy greens and over cooked sweet potatoes. 
Our waitress was nice, did her job but nothing over the top. Don't drop off our drinks and take off. It takes 2 minutes to take 2 peoples order. We were hungry. 
We were disappointed   For the price I expect more. I do wish you could pick your sides. Everything comes with one or 2 sides. 
I loved the atmosphere and would go back for the salads."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great service. I was really impressed by the ambiance the restaurant provided. Everyone's food looked fantastic. I got the guacho burger. It was juicy and big, however I was bummed with the little amount of guacamole on the burger. Still really good. I'd definitely eat there again. 

Note: I'd probably not eat there if you have a short lunch, it took a bit longer than I thought."}
{"text":"I have to say that I have been to Dolittles several times since they opened.I have enjoyed the wood fire grilled rotisserie chicken sandwich. I have enjoyed it, always ask for the sauce off and the service has been good. 
Tonight, we decided on take out for supper-it was early because we had skipped lunch. So we ordered at 4:30 and picked it up 20 minutes later. Again the chicken sandwhich was juicy, flavorful and done right. My husband had the pork loin sandwich. he also said that was good.The problem-I ordered mashed potatoes and receive d fries. Dries that were limp, and pretty tasteless. Bummer, because that often happens when you have carry out , which is why I ordered Mashed! Oh well, overall, ok. They need a little variety in the menu, otherwise, the location and interior are good."}
{"text":"Ate here with my wife for lunch. Good atmosphere, the staff is very friendly. Food was not bad. The fish sandwich was not oily and not fishy either. Really good piece of fish used in the sandwich. Service was fast and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I think the ribs were some of the best I've had in town. The meat had texture which is a pleasant change from those places where it \"falls off the bone\". I'm going back just for the ribs!"}
{"text":"I Iam traveling right now and I heard about this place that they grill the chicken on wood  the place is really beautiful atmosphere is nice service was great the food was really really good I recommend if you come to this area come and check this place"}
{"text":"When I eat at Doolittles and find a bug in my food, show my server who says he's sorry, watch the server show the manager the bug, receive no table visit from the manager, and then subsequently get charged for the bugged dish, I give Doolittles a one-star review.

The Doolittles staff had all the opportunity to remedy a problem but decided not to.

This is the shortest Yelp review I've ever written, but there's really no need to elaborate."}
{"text":"Food and service were good. We were traveling with our egg and peanut allergic toddler and chose Doolittles because they had *some* allergy information on their website (dairy, gluten, nuts, fish) Unfortunately the only thing on the kids menu he could eat was a hamburger. All our usual \"go to's\" at most restaurants supposedly had egg in them like spaghetti and grilled cheese when the server checked with the chef. The scallops were prepared just the way I like them and my husband enjoyed the rotisserie chicken."}
{"text":"Very average food, and very bland tasting. 
When you have wildfire grill in your name as a restaurant, I would think you would offer more than 5-7 items that are made in the woodfire grill. 
I had the rib/chicken combo, very tasty chicken, very bland ribs. 
The fries has seasoning salt in them, but could not taste it. The coleslaw was good, probably one of the best restaurant coleslaws I have had in a while. 
The music was to loud for the number of people in the restaurant, but not to loud that it was distracting. And all the mucus playing sounded like bad 80's end of the movie credit music, very generic stuff. 
The staff was friendly, but very fast to come and go from the table, not really seeing if there was anything you needed, much less see if you had any questions. 
Dickey's BBQ, about a half mile or so away, has better tasting food.  
I would give this place a 2 1/2 star rating if I could. It gets a the extra 1/2 star for cleanliness."}
{"text":"My mom and I went for an early dinner on Sunday. We were seated right away. Through the entire meal service was great. Vince was our server.

The food.... I ordered the French dip and my mom ordered the pork sandwich. Both were acceptable but there was no \"wow\" factor. They need to cut down on the salt!  I was feeling it for two days after.  The fries that came with our meal were very good. They were so hot we had to wait a bit before digging in. This is a good thing! Freshly prepared instead of \"cooked two hours ago\" 

The menu is extensive. I think I'd go back and try some of their fish dishes."}
{"text":"So I came to Dolittle's for dinner and drinks this time. I was a little annoyed that I had to ask where to sit to take advantage of happy hour. I get you don't want to post this but it's also not my job to make sure my needs are met. There must be a way to inform your customers.

My service was great but the server didn't seem very knowledgeable about the menu. When I asked him about the mashed potatoes, he had no words. And then I asked about the fries. The explanation big given: delicious, well seasoned. So I got the fries. Big mistake, huge. They were not even hot and kind of bland.

Fortunately the French dip sandwich was amazing. It had good flavor without being too salty. The bread was soft but didn't break apart when dipped in the au jus. It's difficult to find a decent au jus and this place delivered. It was not salty and added a nice flavor.

My cocktail was good. It was the Kinky Mango Sangria. It had great flavor but the large chunks of fruit were not soft. So they were a little awkward to move around when I got to the end of my drink. I also wanted to eat them since most of the booze soaks into them.

I want to give this place a five but I was a little disappointed in the fries and service. So it lost a star. Still a great place."}
{"text":"We ate at Doolittle's for the 2nd time tonight. After eating there a few weeks ago we decided to pick it for our monthly dining out group. Again the meal was good, but I was shocked by the automatic 22% tip, since we were a group of 10. On top of that the tip was calculated on the total including tax. I never tip on the amount including tax, nor should anyone else. I understand adding an automatic tip for large groups, but the service didn't merit 22%. It would be a better policy to add an automatic tip of 15 - 18% and give the customer the discretion to decide if the service merited an additional tip. Tonight's service was good but not stellar."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner after work. 

The positives:  outdoor seating and the grilled wings. The wings were honestly fantastic, I would highly recommend. If I were simply rating the wings this place would be at least 4 stars. They also have generous portion sizes in my opinion. 

The negatives:  I ordered the ribeye thinking it was going to be delicious based on the menu saying it was aged ~25 days. I ordered a rare steak yet when I got my dinner it was rare however they did not render the day all the way in some parts, which obviously was not good. Also the steak was wildly underseasoned, my friend and I both had to add salt. 

I would consider coming back, but likely would order the wings as my main course and some other app. The steak was underwhelming."}
{"text":"First visit was just so so but this time was very good. My wife wanted a salad and she got the Asian one, forget what it was called. She loved it. I had a ruben sandwich that was very good as well. Service was excellent and we had a very pleasant lunch here. The only comment  that is negative is that they still don't have an entrance sign over the door. It  is hard to find it with so many doors all over the place and its a small insignificant one compared to some of the other ones on that side of the building."}
{"text":"Been there for lunch on weekends and dinner on weeknights and weekends. Plenty of good food options. Usually end up sitting inside because of the wait for outdoor seating, which sometimes has seemed a bit disorganized as far as getting seated outside. Service was helpful and nice. It's a small chain, bit doesn't have the feel of a corporate chain at least."}
{"text":"This place is okay. For the price I'd  rather go to one of the surrounding restaurants. It's not worth it in my opinion, drinks are good though"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Doolittles for dinner as we'd driven by a few times and the reviews here on Yelp were generally ok.

The atmosphere was pleasing.  Wood scent in the air.  Clean..  A fine first impression.  It was  A Thursday note and a Packer game night, so the place was far from full.

We both ordered the half chicken.  Mine BBQ.  The food arrived surprisingly fast.  The fries on my plate were luke warm.  The server didn't stop by until I was well into my dinner.  I told him of the fries.  He apologized and said he'd get fresh.  After what seemed like too long, someone else brought fresh, hot fries.  (Over seasoned,  but hot and fresh)

The chicken was tasty but overcooked.  More fat in it than I would like, but that's how chicken is in many places.

We ordered creme brulee for a dessert.  Wrong choice.  The sugar on top had been over-flamed and had to be scraped off.  The custard was underbaked.  

Summary?  OK food, not-so okay dessert.  Average service.  It wasn't great, nor was it bad. We'll return and try again.

1/13/18 Update.  We returned.  I had the half chicken.  Much better.  Not nearly as fatty.  I realize that good lean chicken is hard to find.  

My wife had a chicken sandwich.  It was quite satisfactory.  We had the crime brûlée for dessert.  It was properly baked but still overflamed for my preference.

Summary.  A place worthy bod another visit with a reminder to self to try the cobbler or cheesecake."}
{"text":"I was genuinely surprised with how good my meal was here! I ordered the spit-roasted chicken because one of the Yelp photos here was appealing. I never really order chicken at restaurants, let alone roasted chicken. I'm more a steak or fish kind of gal. But this was intriguing, and sooooo delicious. I couldn't stop talking about how good it was to our friends seated with us. The chicken wasn't dry at all, even the breast. The meat was slightly pink as indicated on the menu because of how it's cooked, but it wasn't undercooked at all. The skin was beautifully brown and tasty. Since it was half a chicken, I was able to save a lot of it to take home. The seasonal veggies were roasted green beans, onions, and red bell peppers with mashed potatoes and chicken gravy. So delish! The simplicity of the dish is deceiving; the food is seasoned well and cooked beautifully. 

I had a bite of my husband's rack of ribs, which wasn't super tender like other place, but it was decent. Our friends enjoyed their meals too so we'll probably come back again and try their burgers."}
{"text":"Amazing resterant. Service was excellent. Atmosphere  was extremely comfortable. I had squash soup, it was the best soup I have ever hhad. My ribeye was very good. My date had ribs and chicken It was even better then my steak.
Very pleasurable dining experience."}
{"text":"What is not to like.  You walk in and smell delicious rotisserie chicken cooking.  The place has a nice warm feel to it.  Nice bar in the middle and a terrific outdoor bar in the summer months.  Odd location but you forget where you are (in a mall parking lot) when you are there.  Service has always been great.  Love the food, the fish fingers are a great appetizer!  Good craft beer selection - which is a must in Madison!  It is a small chain our of MN, but does not feel chain like at all."}
{"text":"Great lunch menu, tasty fish, reasonably priced for a work lunch. I would go back for dinner to try other house specialties."}
{"text":"I like this place and have been there many times.  It's across the street from a Tesla charging station so you might as well kill 45 minutes grabbing a bite while you wait.  It's great service where they always remember you.  The food is fresh and although there are several locations, on one occasion the owner and shareholders were eating there - a good sign.  

Prices are great and the produce is fresh.  My partner loves ribs and also gets the wings.  And then there are whole slow smoke-roasted chickens (we get one each time'to go').  I have no idea how they can sell them for $14 for a whole large bird, but my partner says they are amazing.  

I kind of wish there was a Doolittles or equivalent near every Tesla charging station instead of the infamous Buffalo Wild Wings, a.k.a. screw plant-based eaters.  But alas, perhaps a business opportunity to have restaurants with plant-based eating options near major EV charging stations.  Ha!  :)"}
{"text":"Ate here with my fianceé. Our server was amazing and friendly. Food was fresh and tasty. I would definitely return here again.

Only downside is that they still use latex to prepare food, so that really limits the people that can eat at this establishment."}
{"text":"So I'm told this place started in Minnesota and is trying to catch the wave of fast casual and growing by moving to states similar to is own. Id say it's pretty food.

It started a bit on the down side as the price to get seated could use a bit more attention. People were waiting and not being at least asked hired many people. There seems to be a bottleneck at the host take as they don't see our can't see anybody else so they don't do anything.

Once seated, the inside looks very nice and comfortable and the patio goes around multiple sides. It's great for an after work bite and drink in the summer (and probably winter inside).

Most of the food looked delicious. I had the Wall-Eye sandwich which I was told is like perch. This wall-eye, for those not familiar with fish is a white fish that doesn't have much taste in general but seems good fried and with sauce and seems very common in this area. This particular sandwich looked delicious with a Parmesan crust and tartar sauce. I think it needs just a bit more flavor but it still tasted great.

The raspberry lemonade is also a good non-alcoholic drink for a sunny afternoon.

The server was friendly after seated. I'd definitely come back here to eat."}
{"text":"This is a great locally owned choice in an area flooded with chain restaurants. The food is really good with an excellent selection. Don't skip the delicious Walleye Fingers, the signature app. Yummy!  We also tried the Chirica Flatbread and the Pickled Ahi Tuna Tacos. All great. Busy on Saturday night so we sat at the bar and got great service from Kyle. Nice selection of beers on tap and glasses of wine. Cocktails too."}
{"text":"have been here a few times and haven't been impressed by the food. Atmosphere and service is great! Along with the complimentary rosemary bread. However, the last time I went, the Caesar salad I had as an appetizer was not the correct flavor I was looking for in a classic Caesar salad, and the chicken seemed to taste slightly like tune? Also the croutons were huge and way to crunchy. Now as far as my meal-the chicken fettuccine Alfredo, lacked in taste as well. Definitely did not satisfy the craving I was having."}
{"text":"We were looking for a non-major-chain near East Towne for a sit down meal.  This fit the bill, and we returned a second time.  I would recommend.

Beautiful restaurant, the food smells amazing, and the service is great.

Woodfire Buffalo Wings - GREAT
Tenderloin Crostini - not bad but not as much flavor as we'd hoped.  We probably wont get this again
Smoked Hanger Steak - easily my favorite thing I tried.  Great flavor and amazingly tender
Rotisserie Chicken Sandwich - underwhelming

I cant remember everything everyone in our party tried both visits, but you get the idea-- some things amazing, some things just ok.  Prices are a tad high but worth it for the amazing things.

We will be back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant !! The place a very nice, clean, with great food and great service.  Everything we had to eat was very tasty and delicious!! This is a great place to hang out so have in mind that sometimes it might get very loud."}
{"text":"The decor and setting is very nice. Our server, Rachel, was very nice. She made some great recommendations. We started with the walleye fingers (delicious), I had the spit-roasted chicken (delicious, my husband had the rotisserie barbq chicken and he said it was delicious too. Would definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"We finally decided to check this place out. We've been meaning to for awhile now. The wait time was minimal even though it was a Saturday night,  which was nice. We each ordered a drink (blueberry mojito and a Johnny walker red), I got the quinoa salad and my husband ordered the chicken and wild rice soup. For our meal I ordered the Caribbean pork tenderloin and my husband ordered the ribeye. All the food was amazing. I had never looked at the menu before and was a little disappointed there wasn't any pizza. Prices did seem a tad high. Service was good. Overall one of the better places to eat on the east side."}
{"text":"Big disappointment, looking for a place eat near our hotel and saw Doolittles, the parking lot was full so we figured it must be a popular place. The restaurant looks very nice when you walk in, nice upscale decor, very warm and inviting.  Even though it was busy we were seated right away and our waitress, Trish, was very nice and personable.  The menu is disappointing, not as many selections as we expected and based on what I saw other people eating, was overpriced.  All three of us settled on the Friday fish fry, which was 3 pieces of cod, fries and  coleslaw. I am not a fan of coleslaw and typically don't eat it, but I have to say this was really good and the only good part of the meal.  The fish was over cooked so the breading was hard to eat and burnt tasting, the fish itself was chewy and cold in the middle, the fries were way over salted and I couldn't eat them.  The amount of tarter sauce you get isn't enough for one piece of fish and the tiny additional sauce I asked for cost me $2, which they didn't mention when I asked for it.  While I was able to find a nice IPA, they don't have a great beer selection.  This is definitely a place where the look of the restaurant is deceiving."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good value pricing!  Our new favorite on the East side of Madison. Decent wine selection at below average inflated pricing. You should try it!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have consistently had good meals.  One unassuming must have here is the buffalo wings, very unique and unlike other buffalo wings you have had.  I try to get these every time I come.  Other go to items: ribs and wild rice soup."}
{"text":"An ok place to grab lunch, but does not call for a return visit. Mussels in curry sauce are just as disappointing as they sound. The ribs had too much sauce (compensating for poor meat quality?). 

Atmosphere was nice though."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in on sunday for date night. We normally go out for sushi but decided to switch it up a little. We could not be happier with everything! The service was amazing and everyone is very friendly!  My husband got the ribs and chicken with fries and I got the shrimp and crab stuffed tilapia.  Everything was perfectly seasoned and cooked just perfect! I am extremely picky about my fish, the tilapia was cooked evenly and moist. We also enjoyed calamari appetizer which was amazing as well! Granted the prices seem a little high for the location of the restaurant, the bill all in all was not horrible. Will definitely be going back and recommending to family and friends!"}
{"text":"First visit to Doolittles Woodfire Grill. Enjoyed it immensely. Our waiter was attentive and patient as we previewed the menu. First we tried the Walleye Fingers - parmesan crusted - these were fantastic. She tried the Arctic Char with jasmine rice - spectacular. I tried the Smokehouse Ribs - again, fantastic - perfectly smoked pink, delicious flavor and excellent texture. We were very impressed with our service and the quality and presentation of our food. We'll definitely be back. If you are in the neighborhood or passing through Madison - Doolittles Woodfire Grill will be a welcome spot - give them a try, we loved it."}
{"text":"For an East side restaurant it is actually pretty good.  My wife had a wonderful French dip sandwich, but they forgot she ordered mashed potatoes and sent out fries.  They quickly fixed the error and were very nice.  My smoked hanger steak was good but not spectacular.  The prices are very good, but the wine list is filled with unimpressive wines.  The hostess was also not very welcoming when we arrived.  Worth a try if you are on the east side, but Bonfyre is a much better option."}
{"text":"Based on our first visit today I have a very positive impression.   We sat at the outside bar during the Packer/Chicago game and enjoyed ourselves (not just because Green Bay won).   My wife had the fish tacos and really liked them.   I had the tuna melt and it was exceptional.   Beer menu is good...not great...but I could find something interesting to drink.   Service was attentive and responsive.   We will definitely be back to try their wood fired options."}
{"text":"Thursday,18 2014 went dinner by myself sitting at the bar and I order 2 glass wine and calamari apt and chiken Cajun pasta the bartender cost me $54.64 for no reason he stole my money so you guys better think about that"}
{"text":"I typically like to come to DooLittles for work lunches because there are primarily chain restaurants on the East Side. The first thing you notice when you pull up is the smell of the wood fire grill which is what they are known for. There are many good selections of food but I really like the chicken sandwich. The service has almost always been good. The prices are also reasonable. I would recommend DooLittles for anyone who hasn't tried."}
{"text":"It was our first time dining here. We came for dinner to celebrate my grandfather's 91st birthday. We liked the décor and The entire restaurant felt spacious. Tonight they had a special of two dollars off their specialty cocktails. My blueberry mojito was delicious. The kinky mango sangria was amazing as well. We started off with the calamari and the walleye dippers. I enjoyed the walleye dippers a lot as well as the Tatar sauce that came with it. The calamari was good too but a little to cooked/fried for me tonight. For dinner, a few of us had the Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed it. You could choose from french fries, coke slaw or mashed potatoes. My husband had the Smoked Hanger Steak that was served with mashed potatoes and spinach. His steak was perfectly cooked. He had me try the spinach as well and I found it to be a fabulous side (I am not one for spinach on its own, but the way they did it was superb. The rest of my family tried other various entrees on the menu and they all seemed to enjoy their food. We had a nice young man as our server,!after we ordered the food it did seem to take a little bit of time before we got it. They treated the birthday boy to a desert which he took home because he was too full. 
The inside of the restaurant was kept very clean. You are able to see into the kitchen from the restaurant and bar area. The bathrooms were tidy and nice as well. 
Overall we had a very nice dining experience and would come back again."}
{"text":"Took my family of 4 here Sunday night for dinner. I had the Parmesan crusted walleye, and it was superb. My kids enjoyed the corn dogs and roasted chicken. My boyfriend got a salad that was huge and equally delicious, I had to take a few bites myself. Overall the atmosphere was casual enough for my family but still had the high end feel of a more expensive restaurant. We plan on going back and trying a few other things off the menu."}
{"text":"We had family from Minnesota passing through Madison and we met them at Doolittle's. I was really impressed with the quality of the service and the food. We had a terrific waiter named John who is very accommodating and helpful. The food was very good including the rotisserie chicken."}
{"text":"Went there soon after they opened and was pretty disappointed with the food as well as the service. The chicken was very moist and would have been great if it would not have been so salty. My friend ordered a pasta dish and we both find it to be very bland. The worst part of the experience was was the service our waitress knew some of the other diners and paid little to no attention to us all night long. She attempted to explain this by saying it was busy and she was swamped however she had plenty of time to chat with her friends dining there that night. I work in the industry and would have given her a break for being new and very busy but ignoring my table to chat with your friends is inexcusable."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I really wanted to like this place. The  atmosphere was pretty neat especially with it being so close to the mall and I loved the concept of all the meat being grilled on wood chips. Now for the reality of it... we arrived a little after 9 pm on Friday. So the main dinner crowd was wrapping up and almost gone. The waiter seemed in a rush for nearly everything and it would have been nice for him to slow down and explain the menu especially since I explained it was our first time. He talked so fast he actually started stumbling over his own words and we couldn't understand him for some parts. OK not a deal breaker, yet. We then got to take a look at the prices on the menu which seemed a little steep but I was guessing the high price  (over $30) in steak was because it had to be that amazing (they note their steaks are aged for 30 days in seasonings). Our appetizer of spinach artichoke dip was delicious,  in fact pretty close to being the best I've ever had (and I order this a lot). The chicken wild rice soup was pretty good too! Nice sizes of grilled chicken. My Caesar salad was pretty good.  Then came our steaks, the filet and ribeye. For medium it was done correctly, for the well done it wasn't enough. Now I did mention these were aged with seasoning right?  I figured I would not need any additional salt,  pepper,  sautéed mushrooms,  or steak sauce etc, but boy I was wrong. Both steaks were severly under seasoned and to my dismay there was no salt or pepper at our table. In fact our waiter vanished. Neither of us finished our boring steaks. The side of potatoes and green beans were not very good either. And to follow suit, under seasoned and not completely cooked all the way. Eww eww.  This was by far the worst $100 dinner for two I have ever paid for. Needless to say we def won't be coming back for dinner... maybe Maybe MAYBE for lunch and that would be just for the appetizers, salad,  and soup."}
{"text":"We came here after a Badgers game and the parking was limiting. I luckily came at a good time and someone was leaving. Just be aware that parking is limited.

Started off with the walleye fingers. Oh my gosh. These things were perfectly fried and crispy. Then we had the ribeye sandwiches. So good. 

I can't stop thinking about those walleye fingers. It was so busy after a badger game and with the mall traffic, I wasn't planning on trying them out, but wanted to. 

They have a menu that looks extensive, but there are options that can please picky eaters, kids, and people who are willing to try new things. 

Get the walleye fingers. Do it."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, above average food, and a classy ambience. The Aviation theme was perfect for two pilots on our layover.

The complimentary bread was tasty and allowed us to snack before our entrees arrived. The food showed up very quickly. The rotisserie chicken is flavorful and the mashed potatoes were great. The carrots were all cooked a little differently. I prefer mine a little softer rather than crunchy, but that's a personal preference.

This place was very good but the menu is pretty limited."}
{"text":"I've been to Doolittles three times in the last two years and I've thoroughly enjoyed each visit. We first ended up there on New Year's Eve to avoid the downtown crowds and I was pleasantly surprised with my rotisserie chicken sandwich. Every visit is consistent on the following points: 
+ The chicken is moist, tender, and flavorful. It also seems high-quality; no fat, gristle, connective tissue, or weird bits. The mashed potatoes are served in a double portion and do not want for melted butter. 
+ Glasses never go empty, and more often than not you've got a fresh drink waiting once you've got about 1/3 of your glass left. 
+ Staff isn't just friendly, they're downright cheerful. 
+ A manager has stopped by our table at every visit to make sure we're doing okay and to see if there's anything we need. 

By coincidence we've also gotten the same table all three times, despite 10-14 months passing between visits. No complaints - it's a large booth that overlooks the kitchen. 

The overall vibe of the decor is warm and cozy with a general theme of aviation/den. There's a large waiting area out front with a good amount of seating for busy nights - we've never been crowded or made to feel awkward by being in the way while we wait. 

Prices are a bit higher, especially if you go the route of meaty entrees, but I feel like I've found a great deal in the rotisserie chicken sandwich that's on par with other mall-area eateries price-wise but heads above in taste and quality."}
{"text":"Ehhhh. It's okay. I go to this place several times trying different things. I keep thinking it is what I order but it's still isn't the best. I would honestly rather go somewhere else than here."}
{"text":"A little late.  Ate about two weeks ago.  I had avioded it since it opend due to being a wood fire grill.  As a vegetarian these tend to have limited fair.  Not tru here they have an entirely separate menu for vegetarians and it was wonderful.  My meat eating friends were also impressed.  Wait staff was very attentive without being obtrusive."}
{"text":"One of the fancier restaurants in the area; dim lighting and dark woods await you. The inside of this place is gorgeous. Love the deep, dark woods and Doolittle airplane decor. A nice, romantic looking restaurant. 

We tagged along with family because they really like the place. We were seated quickly on a Friday night with 9 of us. It took a while for our waitress to come over for our drinks. She was very friendly but obviously in over her head. We watched her literally fast pace walking alllll over the place, they must've been short staffed. 

I went with a flight of beer but sadly, there was no markings so I couldn't remember which I ordered or in what order they were in. I hope they change that so it's easily identifiable. 

Hubs and I split the full rack of ribs, fries and cold slaw. Slaw and fries were okay, ribs were underwhelming considering what you pay. They're know for their smoked meats but the ribs hardly tasted smoked and they certainly were not tender. Do not expect fall off the bone ribs here. 

One of our family members ordered the BBQ sandwich and couldn't eat it because of how spicy it was. It is not labeled as spicy so that was a downfall. Everyone else was okay with their meals. 

I'm just underwhelmed with food and service here."}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights

1) gluten free friendly
2) good food
3) outdoor seating AND outdoor bar

Great new restaurant on the east side of Madison! I am not entirely sure if this is a chain or not, if so it's a new chain to the area. The interior of the restaurant is clean and modern with a lot of seating, including booths.

We ate outside on the patio. The patio has a shaded area, an area in the sun and a comfy area with couches. Sadly, your view is East Towne Mall and Culvers but outside seating is always nice! 

The food is \"grill style\" American so there are a lot of hearty salads available, grilled meat entrees and sandwiches. There is a gluten free menu available as well! The g-free menu isn't extensive (they don't offer gluten free bread or pasta or show items that can be made gluten free by substitutions) but it is nice that they call out the items. We both had salads for lunch.  I had the grilled chicken and pear salad (gluten free) and my boyfriend had the southwest salad. Both salads were pretty big, with generous portions of toppings and rotisserie chicken. As far as drinks, they have several beers on tap and some in bottles (including gluten free angry orchard!). It also looked there was a nice wine selection.

The only negative here was the service, it was pretty slow considering they weren't that busy on a Sunday. 

Overall, a nice place to eat on the east side of Madison! Try and go on a nice day when you can eat outside!"}
{"text":"Dropped in while in town for business. Sat at the bar, and was really impressed with the food. Had the bbq half chicken. Had a wonderful smokey flavor, and just the right amount of sauce.

Bartender was very friendly, and really efficient. 

Only issue is the smell. You'll walk out smelling like a bonfire."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend the spit roasted chicken!   The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's a little pricey. But great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The food is phenomenal, the entire place smells of amazingly smoked meats. The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. The prices are very reasonable. I'm telling you this is a place to go visit! Seriously the chicken... Oh my God!"}
{"text":"Our first time here after hearing it is overpriced but good. My husband had applewood bacon and cheddar burger which he declared was delicious. I had the crab stuffed tilapia but my meal fell way short of delious. I can cook a much more flavorful fish and the stuffing was almost nonexistent. On the other hand the blueberry mojito was wonderful and the chicken and wild rice soup was satisfying. My husbands only complaint were the abundance of flys landing on him during the meal. I am sad to say I am giving 2 stars and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5 overall, but in the mood to round down on this one.  A large nicely laid out restaurant with a spacious bar in the middle and a lot of tables, and a view into the kitchen.  We arrived for lunch and had a group of 9 as we were in town to take a client to lunch.  The wait staff was friendly and quick to take our drink order.  They asked if we had any questions on the menu and recommended items with chicken as they slow roast them over a wood fire in-house.  We ordered a variety of appetizers to start off, and they all arrived together and were nice and hot, so that was a good start.  The Calamari was forgettable, the Parmesan Artichoke Dip was okay, the Walleye Fingers were a standout, and the Woodfire Buffalo Wings were very good as well.  A quick drop in the fryer, finished off on the grill would have been even better, but as is, they were large, flavorful and tender.

For my main course, I had the Split-Roasted Chicken with mashed potatoes and chicken gravy.  I enjoyed everything thoroughly, but I think the waitstaff over hyped the chicken (or maybe I was expecting more in my mind).  Don't get me wrong, it was good, tender and flavorful, but not knock my socks off great.

You may ask why the three stars, man?  The one thing that threw me off was that the manager approached one of my coworkers and handed him a hand written note to call her (maybe to see about us bringing more 'clients' their for meals?!?).  No business card while doing this is a bit odd, but interrupting in the middle of a conversation to pass a note was a bit bizarre and not courteous."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food.  We splurged in a bottle of Rombauer which we finished later that night. The rotisserie chicken was tasty, but to slap BBQ sauce on the rotisserie chicken and call it BBQ chicken is not really in the spirit of BBQ chicken. Anyhow, numerous reviews warned against having the steak and disappointingly we did just that."}
{"text":"They are getting one star and that was for service only. Our waitress did a wonderful job and was able to take care of our four top. 

To start off we ordered three apps, the mussels, walleye fingers and ahi tuna. Two out of three where good, the walleye has a very strong fish smell and taste and that is not a good sign. 

The next major foul was that we spent over $30 in apps and no sooner did they arrive, then the entrees showed up. So we rushed through the only to let our entrees get cold and then we felt rushed to eat. Did not make a very pleasant dinning experience. 


For the most part, the food was bland and dry. Salads had no flavor and you couldn't even taste the dressing. Ribs where over cooked and very dry.  Fries got served ice cold, so they must have been extras from another order. 

We had high hopes for dinner and was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Even the Lunch menu was pricey. Mac and cheese was not good, also mashed potatoes were very dry. Chicken sandwich was good. They did not refilled our drinks."}
{"text":"No idea why this is a 3.5/5.I've dined here 50+ times and always had great service, food always well prepared and tasted great with a large menu selection for both lunch and dinner. The only minor issue is the parking as you can battle for a place to park with mall shoppers. ps the wood fire grill smells and food tastes great"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant but it kept letting me down    The variety on the menu looked promising 
Lovely place.  Modern and comfortable 
Sunday at 7:00 pm and seated immediately 
Server took our drink order. Each one came one at a time. She forgot the water. My drink had no olives. She forgot
She forgot the dressing on my salad. That took 10 minutes. So did the olives. She forgot the bread
The pears in the salad were hard and raw
She forgot the lime I asked for. My fish was very dry
She forgot my second drink    and forgot the olives again !! Distracted and upsetting my host 
It was hard to get any one to check on us and the place was almost empty. She was very nice but inattentive and forgetful 
This place had potential but it was very uncomfortable for a business dinner to have so many distracting issues"}
{"text":"Way behind on this review (I ate here on July 4th!), but I remember it was good enough to write home about.

First off, loved the bread. It had some sort of herbal (rosemary maybe?) seasoning on it and came with butter. Had to limit myself on that as I could easily wolf it all down in one sitting. The main course was also delicious. I ordered the snapper with mango sauce and vegetables. Cooked just right, and the sauce was tropical and sweet but not too sweet. Our server (I believe his name was Vincent) was very helpful and quick. It was a good decision to come here, and I would definitely visit again if back in Madison."}
{"text":"Unique ambiance, with better than average service. The Southwest Salad with Rotisserie Chicken never disappoints..."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, but didn't have a choice in the matter this time.  I went online to read their menu and saw that this place is pretty expensive for what it is.  Entrees DO NOT include salad or soup.  The waitress will offer it, but know that each costs $5.00 extra.  

The navy bean soup was bland.  No ham.  Needed something.  Wasn't served with crackers.  Just a small bowl on a big plate.  

It took forever for the food to arrive and the place wasn't that busy.  It was a weeknight.  No waiting.  Tables open nearby.

Ordered the Southwest Chicken Salad for $11.50!  It had a little bit of BBQ flavored chicken on it and the dressing was sweet.  Wouldn't a Southwest salad have a little kick?  Not to my liking at all.  And not worth the price!  

My husband had the $11.00 Gaucho burger with guacamole that the waitress raved about. The bun had a skimpy smear of guacamole and the bun arrived really soggy.  No lettuce, no tomato, no garnish, no pickle.  Just the soggy burger and cold fries, which she did replace for us.  

One of our group ordered salmon.  $17.95.  Again, no SOUP OR SALAD INCLUDED.  The salmon was good, but there were maybe 5 tiny shriveled potatoes on the plate under the salmon.  The asparagus, though skimpy, was tasty.  

The waitress was very good.  The manager stopped by and we pointed out the issue with the fries being cold and the burger being soggy.  He said it was the 3rd complaint he's had with the soggy burgers.  Well, don't you think you should fix the problem?  Unreal!  

Very noisy place.  Hard to hold a conversation.  Next time, we're in Madison, it's back to State Street for some great food!"}
{"text":"The hotel I was staying at recommended Doolittles so off I go to Doolittles.There were wonderful smells when I entered the front door and my taste buds started going crazy in anticipation of what might be coming soon. I ordered the chicken Wild Rice soup for appetizer and the spit-roasted chicken for the main course. The soup was good, but only had a few pieces of chicken and not sure where the rice was hiding. The roasted chicken was fantastic, maybe the best roasted chicken that I have ever tried. The chicken has was moist and had a very smoky flavor...just perfect! Finally, my server Tripp was very good. Overall, a very good experience.

My ticket was $26.26 before tip."}
{"text":"Sat next to the window allowing us to view the kitchen. Within minutes I witnessed the lead chef, who was not wearing gloves, rub his nose and then rearrange food on a plate with his bare hands. Seconds later I saw another cook drop his utensil, he then picked it up, wiped it on his apron, and resumed using it. I complained to our hostess who said she would get a manager, there were two on shift. 15 minutes later the hostess returned and said the managers were afraid to come to our table. We decided to leave but stopped at the front and again asked for a manager. This time, one of the managers came right over but as soon as she saw that it was me she would be speaking to, her entire body language changed. I explained what I saw and all she said is that the lead chef washes his hands regularly and usually wears gloves. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"Sangria tasted like old rotten fruit with some tonic water. Entree had a \"use by Saturday\" sticker mixed in. Guac was brown. (They don't have avocado but they have guac? How do you make guac without avocado)?....."}
{"text":"We were looking for something \"fun\" on the 4th of July.  We drove around the east side a bit and noticed the outside seating at Doolittle's.  My wife gave it a thumbs up so we pulled in.  Place was dead, but I think most were based on the cars we saw in the other parking lots.  We sat outside, very nice.  That's where the fun ended for me anyway. It took WAY TOO LONG to receive our drinks.  As I was about 1/4 done with my 1st drink I thought I'd help out by ordering my next drink right away.  I still had to wait after finishing my beer...  Very irritating.    Same thing for drink #3.  Mom liked her meal (she likes everything) my 12 y/o needed to order a replacement meal.  My ribeye was a 5 on a scale of 1-10.  No flavor.  Artichoke dip was really good.  Wife's BBQ salad was good.  Walleye fingers a joke.  Think of a strip of fish the size of a pencil, and put a bunch of breading around it.  Lame..  I guess at the end of the day I just expected more, from everything.  I won't be back, sorry.  Too many other places to spend my money at in Madison."}
{"text":"This was just an awful and uncomfortable experience that led us to cancel our order and leave after eating some chili. First, we sat there as servers kept walking past us. It felt like 15 minutes but I am not positive. Then when we were finally \"greeted\" the server put down a basket of bread with no napkins or utensils. She said she would be back but this, again, took a while. We were about the leave at this point but she came back. We put in our order. As we waited we heard the ladies behind us commenting on their awful service. One of them had a nut allergy she informed the server of and watched as cross contaminated food was put on her plate. Her friend watched her filet be moved around under the heater multiple times. When my boyfriend received his chili he was given a steak knife and a spoon but no napkin or other utensils. As he was eating the manager came over and Almost seemed to make excuses for the cross contaminated food and also seemed to be arguing with the guest. I became uncomfortable and so did my boyfriend. The manager then stopped by us and asked if we had questions. We responded with \"yes, can we please cancel our order and pay for this chili?\"  I just don't know what to say but I would never step foot in here again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here probably about 10 times, lunches and dinners and even a birthday party.  The food is always good.  For my birthday party the kitchen even accepted a cake we brought it and cut and served it for us.  We have tried sandwiches and soups, ribs, chicken, pork, chicken wings, probably at least 1/2 the menu so far and haven't found anything yet that we didn't like.  They have outside seating with bar service and food, or casual seating around a fire pit for drinks and quiet chats. We don't normally drink but they do have a nice wine rack apart from the full service bar."}
{"text":"Food was decent although a little pricey.  Service was sub par.  We were not offered dessert (we were planning on ordering some but were handed the bill instead).  We had to repeatedly ask for water refills.  As our group left, we walked right past our server and he never even thanked us.  Service was certainly not worth the 22% gratuity they imposed."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place an extra star. I ate here twice on a recent business trip. The menu is very appealing and they have a great bar. First time I sat at the bar and service was great. I had the jerk pork which was tasty. The second time, the hostess failed to let my waitress know I was seated so there was a lengthy delay to even get a drink. The scallops were served with lukewarm yams which they promptly replaced. The major downside was that everything was soaked in a puddle of buttery oil. The salad had large hunks of lettuce cores and giant chunks of pear (expected to be sliced thin for a salad). I think they clearly need better training with the kitchen staff and hostess station. Not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch - we thought we would try something different from all the chain restaurants in the immediate area.

Sadly disappointed.  Ruben sandwich was off - no flavor to the corned beef, no dressing, just a greasy mess. Waitress was definitely OFF.  She was bothered that someone wanted food and drinks when she obviously wanted to be on her afternoon siesta!  The place was not empty, but very light crowd - she had 2 other tables, but seemed to want to stay behind the bar and BS.

This may be a hoping night life spot - judging by the other reviews.  But unless you just want a burger (really, who can screw up a burger) I would look elsewhere for good food..."}
{"text":"Tried Doolittle's for the first time tonight and it was disappointing. The rosemary bread and butter and the calamari appetizer were excellent. Unfortunately that just made the entrees more disappointing. The fish on my wife's fish fry were very dark brown with black spots (i.e, semi-burned). Fortunately she likes her fish well-done, so it wasn't that bad for her. 

I ordered the smokehouse spareribs which came with fries and coleslaw. The meat was unevenly cooked, ranging from good to overcooked, and contained a lot of gristle. The BBQ sauce was bland and almost flavorless, as was the coleslaw. Ribs are one of my favorite dishes, and these were among the worst I've had lately. 

Overall a very disappointing experience, especially for the price."}
{"text":"For some reason, I was very reluctant to try Doolittle's when they opened in East Madison. I think part of that was that I was convinced it was a pizza place (hint: it's not); I'm not sure where I got that idea from.

Anyway... my husband and I ate at Doolittle's on a Monday evening. The parking lot looked packed, but there was plenty of seating in the restaurant and outside on the patio.

First thing to know: Monday's are 1/2 off bottle of wine night! They had a decent wine list with some moderately priced bottles for those of us who don't usually buy bottles of wine when eating out! They also sold plenty (most?) of their wines by the glass.

They have a large food menu and there were many items that sounded tempting. We both ordered from their \"Woodfire Cooking\" section. I got the Jamaican Jerk Pork Tenderloin and my husband ordered the Rotisserie Smoked Sirloin. Both were excellent! The meat was cooked well and quite flavorful, but we both really loved the sides. The Pork came with an amazing sweet potato has and the Sirloin came with portobello ravioli. We scraped our plates clean!

We ended up sharing a dessert too. The Mudslide Pie was half frozen when it came out to the table, but it thawed quickly and was very tasty."}
{"text":"We came for a graduation party and I give them credit for accommodating our large party at one hour's notice.  The server had only been there a few days so we thought it odd they would train her on such a large party. The bread service was really slow and we had to ask for it. When we got it, it had a great flavor (although cold). The mahi was dry and rhe fish dinner was burned. They wrote in the 22% gratuity on the receipt which I'd never seen (usually 18% is calculated by the register and printed on bill and you can tip above that if you'd like).  Personally   would not recommend."}
{"text":"4 minutes ago
Food was great, fries which were not the star of the meal anyway but they did come out cold but we're repl quickly with fresh ones. Everything else was amazing, including service & drinks. Great grill flavor on wings & artichoke dip was outstanding! Blueberry mojitos a must. Beautiful decor and ambiance! Definitely a must visit when visiting Madison"}
{"text":"Normally have a pretty good experience here, but last night ordered the Mahi and it got to the table somewhat raw
Manager indicated it was Sashimi grade Mahi, but from the smell it certainly was not fresh. Also first prepared Mahi I ever had that was delivered raw in the center.
They made amends, free drinks and desserts but I must admit I was surprised as it was an early dinner, and not yet busy for a meal to be uncooked. 
I'll stick with the wood fire entrees in the future"}
{"text":"I had such hope for this place and I have never given such a horrible review until tonight.... NEVER order a steak if you like it rare or med-rare, it will be over cooked and under seasoned! However, the service was AWESOME! I travel and eat all over the US 100% for work and this place was awful!

Tonight I ordered to rib-eye twice... over cooked, dry and no flavor; it's hard to cook a steak only a 1/4 inch thick! After sending it back twice, I decided to try the scallops, which tasted amazing, until I started chocking on a piece of wood (scewer or toothpick), which literally caused me choke and have pain for a very long time (see picture posted, unless they deleted)"}
{"text":"So I was in a rotisserie chicken kind of mood so I ordered the rotisserie chicken! The Chicken pieces massive deafly not enough to share for two but definitely something to order if you're extremely hungry. It was moist, yes I said moist, is juicy, And had a delicious Smoky flavor to it. I would definitely order this again."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, but a little pricey.  However, you get what you pay for and service is always spot on.  Huge list of wines."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. I always enjoying going here.
The salads are big and full of flavor and their Gacho Burger is AWESOME! there's something for everyone"}
{"text":"Not impressed! The ribeye was tough and flavorless and for $24 I expected a better steak. The hanger steak was very tough also. Pork chops had no flavor! I won't go there again!"}
{"text":"Great service, fantastic food and drink worth the price they charge, and the restaurant wasn't so loud that I couldn't have a decent conversation with my wife... Will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Music is not too loud. The bartender is a bit \"into his phone.\" Chopped Thai salad is spicy and crunchy! Yum. Sat at bar alone. Got food SUPER quick at 12:05 lunch!! Not a ton of chicken or dressing on the salad though. But every bite is tasty. Prices are reasonable for atmosphere and selection. I would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Two out of three ain't bad. Learned when the waitress says their specialty is chicken don't order the steak. Place is very appealing aesthetically, great looking bar & patio. Of our 3 dinners two were great. My wife loved her BBQ chicken dinner & my mother in-law enjoyed her pear salad & chicken flat bread. That's where the fun ended. I ordered the ribeye steak dinner because the grill smelled so great when we walked in & when I saw the ribeye on the menu I thought how fantastic grilled steak would be. Schwing enna miss! It looked absolutely delicious. I ordered medium rare. It wasn't quite medium rare. It wasn't quite rare. It was raw. The red potatoes that came as a side were not cooked either. Hard as rocks. Raw steak & raw potatoes were not what I was expecting. I was pretty sure I didn't order steak tartare. Next time, if there is a next time, it'll be chicken. The cooks have no idea how to cook a steak."}
{"text":"We stayed in the area for an overnight and found many good reviews for this place. Overall very good to above average and here is why. 

Food 4 stars:  Food was above average. My wife had the barbecue chicken salad. Portion was very big. She raved about it and gave it 5 stars. I had the hanger steak. The steak was nicely smoked, very tender and the best part of my entrée .  The mashed potato was cold and not moist (probably over heated). The spinach was over salted. Due to the sides I give it 3 stars due to the price I paid for it. Our kids had corn dogs and chicken fingers which we had samples and it was very good for kids menu plus it had fruit!  For dessert, I always measure a restaurant by it's creme brûlée. This was the pudding type (short cut) and not egg based custard 2 stars. I had the mud slide. Not a typical mud slide but was good. 3 stars. So overall 4 stars for food. 

Ambiance and facilities:  5 stars and here is why. Above average in ambiance with visibility to wood grill and kitchen. Nice open space dining and large room for a big party (30 guests). Bathroom was amazingly clean. That alone brings overall rating up because if they pay attention to bathroom everywhere else is clean. 

Staff:  3 stars. Our waiter never told us about any specials. We over heard another talk about specials. My wife never had her water refilled (had to ask). He was very nice but for price I do expect a bit more. 

Misc:  nice wine menu. Wine flights and beer flights. Nice!

Summary:  would I come back?  Yes. A few changes and it could be 5 stars for me.  Worth a try!"}
{"text":"It smelled AMAZING here, so we ordered the main event- the smoked rotisserie chicken. It was good and tender, but not amazing. I left much later than I wanted to (took quite awhile to get the food). I left full, but a little disappointed and much more poor. All wood fired items are at least $18. Ok, but we won't go back."}
{"text":"Came here on date night before we went to a comedy show. It's a little pricey, but for good reason. Food is absolutely stunning and the service was perfect. A very romantic environment. Well done, we will definatly be back when our budget allows it."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed with this restaurant and had a wonderful time with my girlfriend's family!    They had originally requested we go there after hearing great things about their fresh chicken, and it was WELL worth driving across town.  There were TV's all over and plenty of space to walk around so it would be a great location for a bunch of friends to get together and watch football.

The prices were a little high which is why I cannot give this place 5, STILL, I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"FOOD: The food was okay, but  nothing special...especially considering the prices. At this price point, I know I could get superior food at another restaurant in Madison.

I had the lamb burger. The meat was good, but the burger bun was a soggy mess; I couldn't really eat it like a burger since the bun was falling apart. My sister had the salmon and thought it was okay, but not great. The people in our group who ordered steak or chicken were the happiest with their meals. I would consider going back to try the steak or chicken.

DRINKS: The cocktails were a bit too sweet and kind of weak. They have some pretty cool beer and wine options though. You can order a flight of wine, so you get 2 ounces of 3 different wines! They also have a similar option with beer where you can try different kinds.

SERVICE: The waiters were charming, seemed very knowledgeable about menu items, and were able to answer questions and describe the food well.

ATMOSPHERE: The decor is cool. You can see the woodfire grill that gives the restaurant it's name.  

The outdoor area looks really cool. They have comfortable seating and a fire pit! This would be a nice place to meet friends for drinks.

Tip:  Complimentary dessert on your birthday."}
{"text":"Unbeknownst to me, their specialty is chicken that looks pink/raw. I ordered a pasta dish with chicken and was surprised to see what it looked like when it arrived. The server did not provide a disclaimer, even though both my friend and I ordered the same dish. I'm pregnant, so for peace of mind I asked to just have the pasta with the chicken removed. This seemed problematic for the staff and manager, who just kept trying to convince me \"its supposed to look like that.\" I have attached a picture, so you can be the judge. Either way, the customer is (supposed to be) always right. I was clearly wrong in their eyes, and they let me know it multiple times. In the end, they charged me the full amount for the dish, even though I never ate any chicken and had it removed on my replacement plate. Service was subpar. The servers treat you as if everything is a hassle. Was never offered a refill on my soda the entire meal, and was not served or offered any water. Server was nowhere to be found through the meal. With the prices (sky high for what you DON'T get) and service, I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"NOT IMPRESSED. We had a reservation for 6pm for 4 adults and 1 child. Took about 10-15 minutes to get a table (this was after groups of walk-ins were seated right away). It was prom and graduation so I understand being busy. After being seated it took almost 10 minutes for the waiter to come get our drink order. Finally placed our food order around 6:30pm. Took OVER AN HOUR to get our food. I watched groups come in after us, get their food, eat and leave before we even got our food. FINALLY the waiter came over after we got our food and told us we would get 1 free dessert for our wait. The food was edible.  My burger was over cooked, my mother in laws salad was wilted from sitting so long before being brought to the table, my child's food was cold, etc. The waiter came back and asked us if we wanted the dessert menu.  So we said we would like the dessert menu. He never brought one. We finally had to leave because our child started to melt down. My in laws were buying dinner so they had to wait for the check. When all was said and done it took 2 hours and 10 minutes from the time we got there at our reservation time to the time we had to take a melting down child out the door. My mother in law said they waited another 20 minutes after we left before they finally got the check. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food & service! Very dog friendly. A big thanks to our server Trish, who made our pup super happy by giving him a piece of bacon!"}
{"text":"Four of five of our dinners were OK, the fifth was not. We had a variety of dinners, rotisserie chicken sandwich, hamburger, rotisserie chicken, cajun pasta. They were all average, no one was too excited, but nothing awful. Our fifth diner ordered the fish fry and it was like three fish sticks of fish with fries and coleslaw for $15.95. Way overpriced for what you get. I guess that is what you get when you order fish fry from a woodfire grill place. Please don't offer a fish fry in WI if you don't do a good one. The mashed potatoes were awesome, our server was average. Too many other places to choose from to go back."}
{"text":"Wow, what a find!  First, the Aha Tuna appetizer was spectacular.  Follow on was a cessation salad, which was the low point of the dinner, just because it was a little yucky lettuce wise.  Then the Walleye was the best I've ever had with garlic potatoes and green beans.  After perfect main course, decaf coffee and a mud slide pie were Devine!

We'd both come back again."}
{"text":"The 5 star review is for my specific meal. The atmosphere and restaurant itself gets a 4, and it's a great stop if you're looking for something a bit more upscale than a Friday's or Applebees. 

As for the reason I give it 5...for the lamb burger alone. I was still thinking about this burger 25 minutes after I ate it. It was perfect...perfectly toasted bun, tender and juicy lamb burger patty (medium), and topped with just a bit of lettuce, a jalapeno mint jelly, and goat cheese. Simple, but packed full of flavor.

I eat a ton of burgers. It's my go-to menu item when eating out. And this is the best burger I've ever had."}
{"text":"A strong four and a half stars.  I needed a quicker lunch by East Towne but didn't want fast food, so decided to try Doolittles.  First off, seating was friendly and immediate.  As soon as our hostess sat us our server was there asking what drink we wanted by offering water, Pepsi products, lemonade or suggesting the drink menu.  She was back with our drinks by the time we skimmed the menu.  

I had the Rotisserie Pork Loin with Mango Chutney.  It was as delicious as it sounds.  The pork was fall off the bun moist and seasoned beautifully.  The veggies added a crunch to the sandwich and was sweetened just enough with the sauce.  The fries were fine-nothing spectacular but hot and crunchy.

What did impress me was the speed in this restaurant.  We received our meals within five minutes of ordering, refills were put on the table with a smile before our glasses were half empty.  We were also seated by the grill so I got to watch the efficiency of their system in action.   
Excellent experience that I'd be happy to do again.  And it took less time than it would standing in line in a fast food place."}
