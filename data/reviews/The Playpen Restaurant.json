{"text":"This place is a refined evolution from owner's former riverdale hotspot Tomi Kro . Food was excellent, cocktails were perfection. Moderate price, for a sincerely wonderful time."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for ages. I've been missing out. Terrific personal service. Nice wine list. Food was really good, flavours distinct. We had the hot pot, mussels, maki ball and sautéed chicken livers, lovely, as was the scallops, lamb and Osso bucco, the liver mousse brûlée was a little bland and the fries good but need a sauce...something. We also enjoyed Brussel  sprouts and both the lemon and chocolate desserts. Portion sizes were good. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Stopped in for dinner during a trip to Toronto a while ago and was very impressed. Love the decor! Laura and team do a great job. I will always go back."}
{"text":"Over the many years, I've enjoyed the food / restarants  of Johnny K, from his self named place in The Beaches in the early '80s, right up to his more recent Tommy  Kro.  Between the 4 of us, we sampled the lobster maki balls, beet salad apps., steak frites, seafood hot pot, scallops & risotto and short rib.  Overall generous servings and good sized flavours; excellent value considering 2 of us had the 3 course prix fixe special.  The Playpen occupies what used to be a cheap beer and wings joint, in an ugly plaza opposite No Frills.  Inside is a mix of kitch lounge with nice light fixtures, playing loudish '80s music.  Both food and service were very good, to the point of making The Playpen worthy of a destination designation."}
{"text":"... save your money.  Service was great but the food was unbelievably SALTY - even the salad!!  

$8 for a mixed leaf salad, that could have added a tomato, maybe radish, something other than just leaves.
Salmon was undercooked.  Fries were good, but could have been more inventive in seasoning.  The roasted beets came to us pickled and freezing cold - like straight out of the fridge cold.  Chicken livers were decimated, overly salty, and questionably tasting.  Train wreck!

Too bad because the coffee was good, service was excellent, and the jazz music playing was a great touch.  

Needless to say won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve a low rating. The food, decor, service was superb from start to finish. This is supper club dining at it's finest without any of the pretention.

We had a truly wonderful experience and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Good wine list, good service and decent decor make this a nice go-to favourite of mine. The food has always been exceptional. The outside though, needs a lot of work if they want to appeal, currently it looks rather drab and uninviting."}
{"text":"If you are a follower of Johnny K for the last 30 years, you will be very familiar with Laura's menu and some of people who have been with this couple for years. This is J&L's last one and truly the best.
I love the casual atmosphere, the parking and the FOOD! OMG the food. It has so many favorites and some new ones. This place has a fantastic bar, with bartenders that are actually trained and competent in making cocktails. I actually like going here as a \"Lounge\" , having a couple of drinks and aps. Dinner is fun and the Tartares are GREAT!."}
{"text":"The usual high quality dining standard that is expected of Johnny K and Laura Prentice restaurants.  Even closer to where I live than Tomi Kro so I am bound to be a regular.  The lamb and duck were both excellent.  The menu is all over the map which in this case is actually a good thing."}
