{"text":"This is a whole table review. Mom 3 star dad 3 wife 3 child 5(that's her new favorite number) and me 1. Mac and cheese was good, pot pie was hot but runny, and ribs were cold. Typical atmosphere for a saloon, very friendly staff, and smokers sitting all around you. Won't be returning unless everywhere else is closed."}
{"text":"Under new management and it's worse. Foods the same but prices are up and service is down. Unfortunate because I used to really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"We stopped by for an early dinner last Saturday and we love this place!  The service is prompt and our server offered many suggestions for drinks and food and he was spot on.  The owners stopped by and chatted a bit as well.  Very friendly atmosphere.  The restaurant itself is not huge but there is an outdoor patio that doubles the size.  It's outfitted with heaters and looked very comfortable.  The cowboy decor was very interesting, especially the bathrooms.

I ordered a \"Miranda Lambert\" cocktail, which was basically a cosmo on steroids.  It was delicious!  It had three fresh cranberries floating in it, which I thought were pretty, but then my server asked if I had tried them, I replied I didn't think we were supposed to eat them.  Well I went ahead and tried one and oh boy, it was like doing a little mini shot.  Turns out they are soaked in moonshine!!  Excellent.  My husband had an amber ale and was very happy with it.

We shared the fried pickle appetizer and they were very good.  I would order again.  If you've never tried this, this is the place to give it a shot.  For our meals I had the prime rib sliders...so, so good.  They give you 3 huge sandwiches for 8 dollars and au jus for dipping and horseradish sauce as well.  I was only able to eat two of my three sandwiches.  The onion rings that came with it were a disappointment however...they were cold.  My husband had the chicken pot pie and loved it!  It came in a little mini cast iron skillet and filled him up quite nicely...well that and my third sandwich.  

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped by to try a new place for lunch. One word describes the experience OUTSTANDING. We tried the AZ chicken sandwich and the Chili Cheese Burger both meals were perfectly cooked. Very generous portions and multiple sides to choose from. The staff was incredibly friendly and the restaurant clean and a nice atmosphere they also have a nice outside patio area you can enjoy. I also tried a Bloody Mary while we were there it was very enjoyable as well. This establishment is under new ownership so stop by and give them a try. We will definitely be returning as regular guests."}
{"text":"I am giving 5 Stars on New Years Eve because of the service. Our waiter had to stay because others called in sick. The food was a little delayed but with the wait. I had the French Dip. Very good."}
{"text":"One of our family favorites!!! 

Actually stumbled upon this place by mistake.  We were trying to go to Humble Pie (which we discovered on Urban Spoon), but they were packed, and ended up here instead.  Have been back a dozen times since and really love everything about this place.  Food has always been amazing, the tortilla soup is one of the bests I've ever tried.  Other favorites are the chips, the pretzels with cheese, the quesadilla, the french dip, and the spicy mac n cheese.  

Needeless to say, we have still never tried Humble Pie because we think Barrel Grill is too good to go nextdoor :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor is the only reason this place gets any stars. The service was slow (on a Tuesday night with barely any customers)... The prices were high... And the food was terrible. We will not be dining there again."}
{"text":"We got skillet con queso for an appetizer..delicious. I got the pot pie and my fiancé got the prime rib sliders. The pot pie was one of the best I've ever had, and he loved the sliders as well. Great service, yummy drinks!"}
{"text":"Good food, great happy hour prices, nice atmosphere, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is hands down AMAZING. Food is out of this world and clever beyond anything I would have expected. Customer service is phenomenal and everyone is so accommodating and informative. The ribs, spicy Mac and cheese, quesadilla and fried potato chips are all SO SO good."}
{"text":"Food: Started out with the Buffalo Chips appetizer and was very pleasantly surprised! Other restaurants tend to let these sit out too long so that the chips gets soggy but these once were fresh, crispy, and delicious. I ordered the New York Strip, which was flavorful and a seriously good cut of steak. They made it perfectly Medium, which is great since a lot of places tend to either under cook or char the outside too much for my liking. The balance was just right. The steak came with a baked potato and a side of beans. I was impressed that they offer healthier sides! I'm sure you could opt for french fries too. I had to try the chocolate chip cookie skillet, aka pizookie. This one blew me away. I have had plenty of these elsewhere, but I have to say this one was cooked perfectly (not stuck to the bottom of the skillet) and had ice cream with two kinds of syrup drizzled on top: caramel and chocolate. I also tried one of my friends tacos and was equally impressed. Very fresh ingredients and not your typical Arizona taco. You can tell someone cares about quality.

Drink: They offer some pretty cool \"moonshine\" drinks, none of which I had seen elsewhere. Scored some points in the creativity department. I tried the moonshine blueberry lemonade, which I found out later is quite potent and potentially dangerous as they soak the blueberries in moonshine as well! The best (or worst!) part is that you really can't taste the moonshine. 

Ambience: Very well decorated with a fun steak house feel. We sat on the patio and the seating and pre-requisite TVs were great. The patio is nicely covered and there is a huge sliding door to the main area, so you never feel like you are too far from the action and waiving down a waiter for another drink is never an issue. 

Service: Our waitress was great and there were no issues here. We took a while to get acquainted with the menu, and when asked about specialties, our waitress gave some great recommendations and was glad to do so. I can't say how many places I've been where the wait staff is either unsure or clearly annoyed when asked about specifics. After the meal, the owner took the time to ask how everything was, and I was glad to give him my response: great! Later, I looked at reviews on yelp and saw that any unsatisfied customers were answered to directly by the owner and offered to make things right. As a business professional, I really respect when the owner of a company takes the time to ask his customers and hone in on issues if necessary. And I understand that the early days of business are never easy. Give these guys a shot and if you don't like it, I know management would like to hear :)

As for me, superb!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided  to try this place out for dinner. We have not yet tried this place but we were eager to do so. When you go out to eat you want to have an enjoyable meal but it was very hard to do so here. First off, We sat at the bar and heard nothing but cuss words coming from the kitchen. We all cuss...I get it but do you really need to say the \"F\" word in every single sentence. Secondly, my food had no flavor at all. I got the soup which the server talked up and I regret making that decision. Lastly, my drink was empty majority of the time. There is no professionalism here at all. I don't know about you but I do not think you should wear yoga pants to work."}
{"text":"My husband, kids, and I went here for lunch.  I was hesitant because I was afraid it was more of a bar atmosphere, but my husband wanted to try it, so I gave in. SUPER CLEAN and really neat decor. My little boy was excited to sit in the \"cow seat\" and loved the giant wagon wheel on the ceiling. The staff here is super nice. We were welcomed when we came in, and thanked as we were leaving. Michelle was our server and she was great. Super nice, fast and, efficient. She was really nice to my kids-so she gets an A+ in my book. The food was awesome and they give you a lot of it. They greeted every customer that walked through the door. If the hostess was busy, the bar tender did it, if the bar tender was busy, the server would do it. They really worked together as a team. You can tell they care about their customers. I'm so sick of spending money for lousy service and mediocre  food- not this place! Family friendly for lunch and dinner. Probably more of a bar at night time. Our server said they have live music every Sunday night. They also have a beautiful patio. We will choose this place over any big chain place. We are going to try for our next date night to see what it's like at night."}
{"text":"House chips were amazing!  I went for lunch and it was 5stars.  Definetely going to take my wife on a date there."}
{"text":"Their wings for Monday night football at $.50 is a great deal. Sign up for their points!  I'll return again. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Everyone should try them because they are convenient, close and cost effective. Even their restrooms are clean!  Nice place!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are a big fan of Humble Pie, next door. I've been very curious about Barrel Grill but never had the chance to try it until today! We loved it! I'm a big country girl wanna be and I loved the music and atmosphere. We had a pleasant greeting from the bartender when we walked in and our server was pleasant too. I ordered the Southwest Burger and it was scrumptious. My boyfriend had the chili burger and it too was delish! The fries were yummy too! Cannot wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I had a great lunch with my 3 month old the other day the staff was spectacular and I was accommodated with a booth for the car seat. I ordered the Barrel Burger which was very tasty seasoned well but my bun was falling apart but I managed to get it all down the pickle was good too.
      I was super impressed with the design of the place with an open patio area cool furniture namely the cowhide bar stools. There was country music playing just loud enough to not wake a baby and I can't wait to go back for drinks and dinner with my wife maybe before the baseball game on St Patty's Day. It would be on my list to hit for drinks and a date for sure! 

Who ever designed this place gets 5 stars!

I'll be back with friends and family."}
{"text":"Came here for the reverse happy hour after a game. Reasonable drink prices. The atmosphere was cool with good country music always playing. Summer shandy for $4. Nice and refreshing after a long, hot day.

I didn't get any food, but the menu looked pretty legit. They didn't have any original nachos, which is what I was in the mood for. But the waitress swore on their buffalo chips, but I just wasn't feeling it. I'll definitely come back when I'm hungry and try their pulled pork or pot pie."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this weekend.  Will probably go back but will try something different.  Wife had the chicken caesar salad and it was good but was served with 'very' cold chicken (like right out of the refrigerator).  Good spicey flavored dressing and fresh grated parmesan but the cold chicken was a turn off for her.  My pot pie was good but not great!  Too much sauce and not enough chicken and/or vegetables for the price.  With a tip it was a $40 dinner and that's too much for what we had (diet drinks) we think.  Atmosphere good and a plus for the west valley but they need to take a look at the pricing."}
{"text":"I didn't want to try anything on the menu...it either had pepperjack cheese, bacon, chipotle sauce, or jalapeños. I got the house salad with chicken and was not impressed in the slightest. I'm glad I had a BOGO coupon. 
I tried three of the drinks (bloody mary, strawbily, and bootlegger). The bloody mary was good but on the spicy side. The other two were pretty nasty. The bartender was kind of rude at first but started being more friendly as we getting ready to leave. Service was ok. Not very attentive but oh well. I wouldn't choose to come back...just not a place I cared for but that's because I don't like the food choices they offer."}
{"text":"I guess we caught this place on a bad night. It was 15 minutes after we were seated before our waiter came by. Once he got the drink & app order it was another 10 +. I ended up going to the bar to get our drinks, I could see them just sitting there in the service station. Finally someone brought our apps out, which were good, but no waiter. After a total of 45 minutes I asked the manager to just get us our check. She did and made no attempt to save the meal. Not planning on going back. Since there were plenty of empty tables it should not have been that slow."}
{"text":"We have been to Barrel Grill about 10 times now, I didn't post this until now because I wanted to see how consistent they are. The first 2 times we went we had the Ribs & we all agreed they were the best in town. The BBQ sauce is a little vinegary which we loved. Everything we ordered was hot & fresh. The Tequila Beans are out of this world, made in BBQ sauce that is a little sweet so they complimented the vinegary rib sauce well. The next time we went I had the burger & had to send it back, it was well done & I ordered it medium rare. It came back medium well this time. The meat was a thin patty, dry & very mediocre. It looked like it was steamed because it was greyish & there were no grill marks or dark edges from being cooked on a griddle. They don't tell you the size burger on the menu, I thought it was only 1/4lb when I saw it but they told me it was 1/3 lb. For the price I thought I would get a thick juicy 1/2lb burger. Okay, lesson learned, I won't ever order that again. My friend & husband ordered the Grilled Fish Sandwich & hers was thick & she liked it very much but my husbands was thin & only okay. Next time I ordered the Sloppy Joe & I'm hooked. The sauce is a little sweet & it's heaped on a soft roll. The sweet potato fries are excellent, piping hot & they sprinkle sugar cinnamon on them which I loved. I order the Sloppy Joes all the time now & they are always good but the sweet potato fries vary from piping to room temp so they are not consistent. Beans are consistently very good. The Pulled Pork Sliders were very good but the Onion Strings they came with were cold & limp. Several other visits we ordered the ribs hoping for those moist hot ribs we had on the first 2 visits but to our disappointment they have been drier & only just warm. What happened to the best ribs in town? It now seems like we are getting ribs that were made the day before. We're going to try them one more time before we give up. I so hope they go back to their high standards so I can go back to recommending them to my friends. I know you can do it because they've been excellent before. I'm rooting for you. The servers are friendly but we belong to the rewards club & never seem to get our points added on. I don't know what the problem is with that, it seems like such a simple thing to do. The ambiance is rustic western with very roomy booths & tables. The dim lighting is perfect for relaxed dining but it's not dark by any means. They have several TV's around the bar which is in the middle of the room so the games can be watched from most tables. There are 2 separate outdoor dining areas, 1 with just a few tables & one much larger. This restaurant is hit & miss food wise, I haven't tried the drinks, but I still think it's worth a try. When the food hits, it really hits!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. The food is good, but the service lacks a lot. Waited today for 1 hour and 23 minutes and never had a server ask us for our order. Even after walking inside and asking for service."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and I am not impressed with the service.  I sat at the bar and waited for 10 minutes and nobody asked me what I wanted to drink.  The bar was not crowded so I walked next door.  They have potential because it looks cool and they have alot of TV's for sports but the service needs to improve. I will give it 2 stars because it looks cool otherwise it deserves a 1."}
{"text":"There is little good to say about my experience on mothers day fries were cold and the new ones we asked for still cold but to top it off the manager that was on could not have handled it any worse. Will not go back."}
{"text":"The food and prices are good, the service literally sucks.
It was good when we first started going there, but recently the service is very bad.
They get our drink order, start drawing up the beer, then when the beer is about half way filled the bartender decides to go chat with someone.
After about 4 minute he came back and asked if we was ready to order. 
Every drink we had to chase the bartender down, and they only had 7 customers setting at the bar and one table with 4 people.
The female bartender that comes on at about 4:30 does not go focus on serving the customers, I think her job is to just hang over in front of the customers showing her big cleavage. That's pretty much all she is good for, she won't take any customers orders.
We are done with this place."}
{"text":"This place wasn't worthy of a rating. The waitresses seemed very flakey, I watched our drinks and food sit unattended for 5 minutes or more. The drinks were weak, the food was not only slightly over-priced but ours showed up absolutely cold! Wouldn't recommend to anyone. I would give no stars if I could."}
{"text":"Great décor, atmosphere, food and drinks.  Service was a little slow, but made up for it overall.  We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened and always have a good experience. The food is great and the service is always fantastic! The fact that they have a live band is always a plus! Their spicy Mac and cheese is absolutely delicious!
Awesome place to grab a bite, beer and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was good but worst service!  We walked in and the manager just tossed menu's at us  . No hello no common courtesy. I am a server and that's the first thing you do ! This  is the first and last time we will eat here."}
{"text":"Took a friend there a few weeks ago, you know, the kind of friend who always finds something wrong :) It is not like she is unreasonable, just bad luck I guess. We were both very happy with the food and service. I will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I \"accidentally\" found the Barrel, because the one place we were going to eat at was jammed packed full...but, what do you expect for a popular chain cookie-cutter restaurant. So, we stumbled across the Barrel Grill. It was busy, but not \"standing room only\".

Great environment. Outstanding food. The Manager was doing her best with such a skeleton crew, but, that's the good industry! 

We go there everytime we get up to the Peoria area!

Skillet con Queso is a go, as well as the Cowboy Tacos!"}
{"text":"Never had fried pickles, oddly yummy. Sat at bar and  had a few appetizers and beers. Frosty mugs for draft beer are fantastic! Appetizers average. Had cool moonshine drinks on menu but did not try.  Very cool atmosphere. Bartenders could smile a bit more but you could tell they had a lot going on with football TV requests starting. Hostess was friendly with hello and goodbye. We will be back as long as the frosty mugs are there!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went in two hours before closing on a Saturday night. The place was pretty empty. We sat down at the bar and waited and waited while the bartender ignored us and the other servers stayed in the kitchen. No one greeted us or told us they would be with us momentarily. So we left and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went there for a family gathering (10 of us) on a Monday evening.  The place had about 4 other tables going.  For not being busy the food took way to long to reach the table.  Nothing outstanding about the food and asked for a well done burger and it had to go back as was pink.  Will probably not go back as you can get a better burger for a better price elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place could be great if anyone nice worked here. The staff treats people like crap. The are always understaffed. Too bad because I used to like this place."}
{"text":"The best buffalo chips around! My favorite if your craving buffalo sauce! The drinks are good and you can catch live music too. Definitely a hidden gem ;)"}
{"text":"AWFUL!

Group of 4 for dinner & drinks.  Of the 4 different entrees ordered all were lacking in flavor.  All the food appears to be pre made, nothing fresh.  In fact our server told us that the chicken is pre seasoned so no option for altering. the server also said that when a table near us who received their food way before us even though we ordered before they ever sat down by 40 minutes that they got their food first because what they ordered was pre cooked so just needed to be preheated!  
No manager doing rounds to the tables.  It seemed odd since this is a brand new place.  If you like fresh food this is not the place to go.  
Ended up at humble pie for dessert in order to have something tasty to eat that night."}
{"text":"A great lunch today at Barrel Grill, Peoria AZ.

Beer Can Chicken: Was tender, fall off the bone and well seasoned. 

Grilled Salmon: The portion was larger than expected and served with a tasty sauce. The service was friendly and swift."}
{"text":"I have been at this restaurant five times now and have a good handle on the food and service.  I recently was supposed to meet some friends at the Texas Roadhouse across the street.  While I tend not to go to chain restaurants, I obliged my friends.  We had reservations and still had about an hour wait.  I convinced them to try Barrel and we got in right away and were all very pleased!

Our servers have always been attentive and pleasant.  The food has consistently been very good.  The ribs are some of the best I have had.  Their prime rib salad is very hearty and good.  My wife and I like to each order a meal and split it with each other.  Without asking, they split our meals without a charge.  I would highly recommend their skillet desserts.  The apple and peach crisp a la mode are excellent.  They have a great patio and fun ambiance.

Give this establishment a try and support the local economy and some great folks at Barrel!"}
{"text":"Worst service we've ever had. We just walked out of there after sitting for 38 minutes without our order for dinner being taken.  They did take our drink order and appetizer order and served those,  but didn't come back until 38 minutes later.  The waitress was standing at the back of the bar the entire time bull shitting with a guy that worked there.  Then came and asked what we wanted to order after 38 minutes.  I said nothing and I left cash on the table to pay for what we ordered and we left.  We'll never go back.  Place was a joke!"}
{"text":"This was our first time having dinner here. the atmosphere is pleasant with an old country feel. My wife's mojitio as a bit different without the mint but she really enjoyed it. I appreciated the variety of beers since my favorite beers are craft beers. Our waitress was great. She was efficient without being over bearing.  She was also very pleasant and seemed to interested in providing us a great experience.  Of course we went there for the food.  I had the French dip with the tequila beans.  Great sandwich. It was well proportioned, hot from the grill and delicious. My wife had the chicken posse salad. Again it was a really good salad with a generous portion. This will definitely be one of our favorite places on the west side"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with my wife. I guess the best way to describe it is it's a southern style restaurant. Anyway onto to the food!
To start we had some fried pickles. They were delicious! Just enough batter without overpowering the pickle. We also each had a pint of their own beer, barrel grille beer (I don't think they brew just throw their label on it) which was great as well. Our waiter didn't know much about it but it seemed to my wife and I as a amber styled lager.
For dinner I had the country friend steak. The portion was huge however it was so salty it was close to inedible. It wasn't so salty that I would send it back but to salty for both my wife and I. I dunno maybe we are both just shy about sending stuff back. Anyway, with it I had some spicy mac and cheese which also was no good. It was bland and watery with barely a hint of cheese in there. Also had the green beans and almonds which was good, hard to screw up beans and almonds though!
My wife had the cowboy tacos which she said was good but thought it was overpriced. 15 bucks gets you 3 little tacos and a side of beans. 
So there you have it. I gave it a 3 because while the food was so so, the service was great and I liked the ambience. Probably wouldn't go back just due to the fact there are too many other places similar to this one who can make the food more to my liking."}
{"text":"Autumn was the best server! The food is amazing and fresh and the drinks were unique and dangerously delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Country themed.  Live music.  Rustic.  Good for large or small parties.  Full bar.  Attractive waitresses.  Great food at reasonable prices.

Had the pretzel/cheese appetizer.  A little small, but just enough to keep us full until the entrees arrived.

I had prime rib.  A very large cut with minimal waste for only $19!  Unbelievable!
Wife had blackened ribeye.  Delish and plenty to take home in a doggie bag.
Kid had chicken salad.  Spicy with tortilla chips.  

They serve moonshine!  Yes!  Call Tim and Tickle, someone is selling on their route!

Server was quick, attentive and not hard on the eyes.  In fact, the wait staff was made up of all beautiful people.  

Live band, country.  A bit loud, but they were in tune and on pitch unlike most local live bands.  And they took breaks to allow dinner conversation."}
{"text":"We once again received STELLAR service from April.  She is phenomenal!  She took the time to make me bleu cheese olives for my martini and I could not be more appreciative.  The families meal was beyond delicious, I had the salmon and the veggies were so good my daughter ate some! (Not much of a veggie gal)  The zucchini is Australia to start, beautifully breaded and very moist!  Looking forward to our return!  Thanks again April!!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, food was great. Service was fine, nothing special but not bad either."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a really cool vibe. Definitely country.  There is a cool giant wagon wheel hanging above the dining room. I had the chicken pot pie, amazing crust and delicious filling. Jesse had the beer can chicken,  super moist and came with 2 sides.  The tequila beans were beyond anything I've ever tasted. Fast and friendly,  our server was great. Restrooms were impeccable and have cool metal work. They have a nice outdoor patio. I'm happy to see a new business in the area. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is about the food. A decent place, but I wasn't wowed with it. I did not like my Southwest Caesar, and the fried pickles were delicious! Also the waitress was a little rude."}
{"text":"First impressions were eek - we were greeted by the  hostess who was standing amongst all of the waitresses   and led to a booth , nice enough . We sat for a minute and I looked up to see all of the waitresses standing up and eating at the bar . Apparently our waitress was hungry so she finished eating and came over to take our order . 

We both ordered  side salads , they were served in a side bowl on a plate. My husband ordered the Cesar's and it was basically romaine lettuce with parmesan  on top . No croutons and spicy ranch .... 

Main dish ordered steak - sent it back because it was served   rare after I stressed warm pink center . She said she totally got it and the chef would understand. Husband ordered the pasta and only ate  the chicken from the Snakebite Pasta and that's about it . Steak came back cooked to order along with a comment that the cook knew that I would send it back... Really , why did you serve it then ? 

 For the price it was not worth it . We will not be back - but I wish them the best of luck ."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour deals. We loved the $4 chicken quesadilla and my husband enjoyed the $3 Firestone beer. 

I ordered a side salad and the $5 salad came out as an entree size side. I suggest a smaller portion for a side salad. The waitress told us the other option was a ramekin sized salad that would have been too small. Feels a little like Goldilox.

The prices seemed a bit on the high side for the area with a ribeye at $19 and country fried steak at $17... Until we saw the portion sizes. Both dishes could have easily been split between two adults. The country fried steak came with a spicy chorizo sauce that was my favorite part of the whole dish, mashed potatoes and veggies. Overall, a decent meal.

My husband's ribeye came with very tasty black beans and a large baked potato. I found the ribeye to be a bit bland but my husband really enjoyed it.

We'll be back but maybe we will split a meal and add a couple of appetizers."}
{"text":"Love that on Tuesday I can get some wine for 2 bucks!  The moonshine drinks are also very good.  I had the chicken pot pie that comes out in a skillet...best chicken pot pie ever!  The only thing I didn't like was the tiny side salad that was served in a tiny bowl that you had to try really hard not to knock all of the lettuce out.  Definitely will be back..especially for happy hour."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and craft beer selection. Comfortable seating inside and out with some great staff as well."}
{"text":"Okay enough if you're up for a cocktail or beer, but I would not recommend eating there."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem in the Arrowhead area. Great food, service, and atmosphere. Baby back ribs are delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food and service we have found a new fav. We had prime rib and ribs. They were both amazing."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here for lunch today. From the time we walked in the bar tender gave us attitude which we didn't appreciate. She didn't smile or act friendly. The food was really good though."}
{"text":"Great spot for Happy Hour! Clever menu, and great tastes. Fun decor, airy, comfortable and not cramped with a modern western theme. Very attentive service with everyone helping out when it got busy.I have not tried it for dinner but am anxious to do so.
A great addition to Peoria!"}
{"text":"It takes more than looks to make a restaurant successful. This place needs new management, poor service due to lack of servers. Know your surroundings, if you open a restaurant next to a ballgame be prepared for a crowd. I had the steak salad; Wow, it was a slice of very thin prime rib on a very basic salad.  When I say thin, I mean so thin it just disappeared in the salad. $14?"}
{"text":"Always looking for a new option on the west side. We were pleasantly surprised here. Peoria posse salad was fresh and spicy, the chicken tortilla soup was pretty flavorful. Not a huge beer selection, but had a couple local draft options. We aren't cowboy or country, but the decor was nice. Service was fine, nothing stellar, nothing bad. The outdoor seating area looks like a lovely spot for post-spring training meal or drink."}
{"text":"Didn't get that warm fuzzy welcome. Came for reverse happy hour that was clearly advertised on the website but kitchen was closed at 10pm. Horrible beer selection even though the menu and website says different. This is my 3rd attempt to come here over the life of the place but it was not a charm!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and the only dish I liked so far was the prime rib. It was a huge portion with excellent flavor. Our overall impression is this place has poor management. Service is slow even when the restaurant is slow. There are often issues with meals, ordering, food undercooked, etc."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place out since none of us have never been here before.  Well, we weren't disappointed. The atmosphere and food was nothing short of amazing.  I had the chicken tortilla soup and I can't remember the last time I had soup that was so delicious!  Their drinks are just as good. Oh and the mac n cheese is really good too."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was cool and the food was good but overpriced and the drinks were outrageous. Service was very poor. We barely got a how do you do.... Chances that I'll be back are slim."}
{"text":"The decor is western of course......the inside is dark and cool temp wise.
We sat out on the patio, which was nice, especially this time of year, but come summer months it'll be ugly hot out there.
I had the SW Burger...........it was so tasty, the roasted green chile made it, not too much 1000 Island sauce either. The sweet potato fries were perfect, not soggy or greasy. The Stellas on tap could be colder.
My husband had the roast beef on French roll. That too was very good.
A perfect place to stop in after a ball game at the Peoria Sports Complex."}
{"text":"I went there on a Tuesday night with a friend. The interior is anything but \"saloonish\". The server was on us immediately. We had an appetizer that is a combination of chips and hot wings. It was great, but way too big. I had the blackened ribeye and my friend had the prime rib. Both were just right. The side offerings were hard to choose from because there were so many. I especially liked the sweet potato fries with a hint of cinnamon. Easy five stars!"}
{"text":"We just had THE WORST experience dining ever there. The place is empty, literally 4 people in the entire restaurant when we got there at 12:15 and we were a party of 11 and waited for over an hour and a half for our food. Even when it started to come out, everybody didn't get their food and what did come out was not correct. There was no chicken in a chicken pasta!! They just kept saying we are short handed and made excuses for the service! It was horrible!! Their food was great the first time we were there but never again!! I recommend you NOT eat there! Unless you want to spend your whole day waiting!"}
{"text":"We went here for reverse happy hour... Their kitchen was closed at 10:05pm!! Say what?! So, then we decided, we'll get drinks... They didn't have the beer that's listed on their sign or menu that my friend wanted. Their website and menus are outdated and full of false advertisement. Sad day."}
{"text":"Have to say...best chicken fried steak with chorizo country gravy!!  Wow!  Mind blown!  So good I ordered an extra side of gravy to take home with my leftovers (big portion)!!  Happy happy happy!  Great bar staff!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this restaurant after a fun afternoon of target practice.  Wanted to try a non chain and drove by and decided to give it a try, glad we did.  Started with some tasty pretzel bites.  For entree I had the rattlesnake chicken pasta it was fabulous spicy, but not overpowering.  My friend who is a rib snob gave them a try she said they were great. 1/2 slab was very generous portion.  I noticed a lot of their apps and sandwiches has \"barrel sauce\" on them.  I inquired about it and our server brought me a small sample, it was very good, subtle spice with mayo base. I could see using it at home.   I asked if they sold it, our server checked with the mgr who agreed to sell me some for home use.  For $5. I got a nice sized container to use on wraps and sandwiches.   I will definitely be back.  It is locally owned per our server.  Give it a try very nice variety.  They had nice outdoor seating but at 110 we sat inside.  Happy hour menu looked very appealing with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We stopped by after the movies, 4 customers, 3 servers extremely crappy slow service. Rolls burnt, had to ask 3 times for lemons for my tea she forgot as soon as she turned the corner around the bar.
I ended up getting them myself.
One server on her phone the whole time another we asked for help when ours wasn't available she totally ignore us the one with red hair"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for our date night! I was really surprised how empty it was for a Saturday evening. 

Anyways, the restaurant itself was nice & the decor was fun. 

We came in wanting to try their pot pie but once we got there 2 appetizers sounded yummy ( Mac & cheese and buffalo chips). So we asked the waitress if she thought 2 appetizers and 1 pot pie would be enough for 2 people, she said yes! We went ahead and order 2 appetizers and 1 pot pie to share. The buffalo chips were so yummy!! If you enjoy hot wings you will love them. I wasn't a huge fan of the Mac & cheese but my husband liked it. The pot pie was delicious and filling. It was a perfect amount of food. 

The waitress was nice and very inviting. She told us about the upcoming happy hour and let us know that they have live music on Sundays. 

Reason for 4 stars: all of our food came out at the same time. I like appetizers before my main entree. 

We would return!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of seven on Memorial Day. Not crowded and was promptly seated. Nice atmosphere. The waitress appeared new but did a good job. 

The food was horrible and overpriced. Everything was lukewarm to cold, i.e., wings, French fries, hamburger, etc.  I would hate to see what would have happened if the place was busy. Six of seven will not return for a second chance."}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOW! This was our first time here and we were very pleased! The food was awesome and the service was great!! My husband had the Cowboy Tacos and I had the Chicken BLT wrap, they were both very good! We definately will be back and I have already recommended Barrel Grill to several people!! Keep up the great job!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food, but a fairly limited menu. If you like your bars loud and friendly, where food's not your main priority, this is your place."}
{"text":"It was kind of hit and miss at this funky little western themed place.  For those that are not interested in waiting for the perpetually long wait list at TX Roadhouse there on restaurant row on 83rd, this is a great alternative.  You can still play cowboy and have good food without the wait.  

THE PROS:
Easier to get into than the other places if you're at prime dinner time on 83rd Ave.  And there is ample parking (also a contrast to the prime strip of places on 83rd

REALLY good drinks and a very liberal happy hour (even on Saturdays!!) Nice assortment of drinks too, they have a \"hand crafted moonshine\" drink menu.  I got the Pineapple Express and was not disappointed.

Nice outdoor sitting area with some couches if you just want to have some drinks and munchies

The food I tried was good.  Little pulled pork sliders and the spicy mac 'n cheese

If you're into fun and western decor, be sure to check out the bathrooms with their wash bucket sinks and stall door locks that are actually barn stall locks... kinda cute details.

THE CONS:
When we first got there it was pretty early and the service was great.  After the place started to pick up a little the service seemed to suffer.  The first half of our experience was a vastly different customer service experience than the second half.  We almost gave up on getting our dessert, it just took SOOOOOO long.  And it was one of those things that is a brownie in the skillet and it is suppose to be a little gooey on the inside... As it turned out, it was completely raw inside - which was rather surprising considering how long we waited for it.  

My hope is that this was just an issue of being newly opened and that they will get in the groove and the busy hours won't trip them up. 

I will defiantly give it another try.  Aside from our dessert, it was all very good.  Friendly wait staff too."}
{"text":"Dined with a party of 10. Service was good and quick. Everyone but me enjoyed their meal. I ordered the steak salad and was not particularly thrilled. Wasn't fond of the dressing and had to ask for more meat. Four shaved pieces of beef was not adequate for a $14.00 entree. They did apologize and brought more steak."}
{"text":"Came here strictly for drinks last night around 9pm, cute little western themed bar.  We sat down and the bartender greeted us right away.  We started out with some moonshine cocktails as we've never tried moonshine before, SO good. Watch out for the moonshine soaked blueberries, whoo wee those are like a shot of alcohol by themselves! They have a reverse happy hour that starts at 10pm so we stayed for that. Pretty chill environment to come have a few drinks & relax. Love it!"}
{"text":"There are way to many decent places in the vicinity to be eating here. Chicken tortilla soup was actually vegetable soup, chicken quesadilla tasted like something you make when you come home at 2am, burger was average at best. The only thing that was good was the bottled beer. DON'T GO HERE"}
{"text":"I didn't like this place. Only got the prime rib sliders. Comes with three, crunch onions, and some sauce. Tasted like seasoned grease. Menu was limited and over price if the appetizers are any key to the rest of the menu. 
I wasn't really impressed with the waiting staff. I can understand why every other restraint in this area was packed and this one wasn't."}
{"text":"Best chicken pot pie I ever ate! Great service...good food and reasonable prices. Husband and daughter had a burger and street tacos...yummy for all!"}
{"text":"Second time here and boy what a difference a day makes. First time was on a Friday about 5:00 p.m. and it was great. Service and food were spot on. Second visit well-
     Hint #1: If you order the fried pickles (a signature dish) just eat the top layer. The bottom is just sitting in grease.
     Hint #2: If you sit at the bar drink slowly. It's a long wait till the bartender comes back at least on a Saturday at 5:00 p/m. The conversation with the waitress at the end of the bar seem to have been more interesting for the buxom young bartender than the customers."}
{"text":"First time visiting based upon yelp reviews.  It didn't disappoint!  We had the lunch on the patio, and went with their lunch special, which is a choose two (soup/salad/sandwich) deal for $9.  For me, I chose the corn chowder and french dip.  The corn chowder was amazeballs and the sandwich is solid.  My wife had the southwest caesar salad and french dip.  She likes them both as well.   With two iced teas, it was $25 plus tip, out the door for $30.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Seated quickly, but waitress was occupied drying dishes. Bartender made the wrong drink.  Concept is strange, dingy and a bad attempt at modernizing a theme that should not feel modern.  Would not return."}
{"text":"Were looking for a happy hour spot before the movie after finding out Johnny Fox's went under. Gave this place a shot and were pleasantly surprised. Kind of a country music bent but not obnoxiously so. Good micro beer selection with great happy hour pricing. $3 drafts. The quesadilla we ordered was good as well. Sat at bar and bartender very attentive. Plenty of TVs and also a outdoor patio. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Server Jennifer was good.. Attentive and friendly. Atmosphere is nice. At night they open all of the windows. The dim lighting, fresh air, and country music was relaxing. Tasty cocktails and draft selections.. But the food.. The damn food. Expensive and unsatisfying. While the portions are HUGE, everything tastes as if it was frozen. Spicy Mac and cheese was runny and tasted like Velveta with some spice. Chicken fried steak was OK, however potatoes were cold when the food had JUST come out. And the tacos had some weird sauce that ruined it for me. Seemed like ranchy nacho cheese drizzled on top? I don't know. The beans it came with also tasted straight out of a can, with a few tomatoes sprinkled on top. Tasteless. I might give it one more chance just because I enjoyed my drink, music, and location. Overall though, mediocre and I left disappointed."}
{"text":"Middle of the road bar with middle of the road food. The nice thing is you can get whiskey ranging from cheap to high/middle range so you should be able to find one that suits your tastes and budget. The only problem is the bartender that helped me didn't know anything about any of them."}
{"text":"Happy Hour until 6pm on weekends with food and drink specials.  The best part -- $3 craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"I ordered the ribs and they were absolutely fantastic. They are probably the best I've ever had. They have a whole selection of moonshine drinks, which are really good. As for the service though, it was lacking a bit. They only had one server on the floor it seemed. The food was delicious and our server was definitely trying her best with all the tables."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Melanie made the best lemon drops. Ordered pretzel bites with cheese, pulled pork & prime rip sliders, Mac n cheese. All hot and yummy. We will be back.
Loving the country vibe.  Happy hour is awesome!  Only bad thing, no live music or dancing"}
{"text":"We both had beers and burgers! Our burgers were both very good! Staff was great, very friendly and just the right amount of a crowd."}
{"text":"Went in over the weekend. It was nice to see a happy hour on the weekends good start. Got fried pickles. Loved them. Wanted tortilla soup got brought out beef stew with tortilla strips on top. It was gross. I have had a lot of tortilla soups and this wants even close to one. So I got A house salad.  Large bowl of nothing but lettuce. 2 tomato wedges 2 cucumber slices and 4 strands of onion. And the the Italian dressing was gross. I will not go back to eat but will drink there."}
{"text":"We love this place! Have yet to have a bad experience. Atmosphere, employees, and management are great! Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"We just moved across the street from the place. I was very amazed by the cool atmosphere they got going on here. 

We ordered a few appetizers and some beers. the prices here are really great! I ordered the prime rob sliders and a 24 oz draft beer. The food was very filling and delicious. I would definitely recommend the prime rob sliders here! 

The bar area looks really cool too and they have plenty of tv if you are looks for a great place to grab some drink and watch the game. 

I will absolutely be a frequent visitor here. Great place. Great prices. Great food."}
{"text":"This place should have been named \"The Pretentious Cowboy.\"

 The staff and atmosphere are wonderful (if you're into the whole cowboy thing) but as much as they dress it up as fine dining, its really just a sports bar with a limited food menu with small, over-priced portions unnecessarily dressed up to  appear fancier than what they really are. There is no children's menu and the drinks side of the menu has many more options than the food side of the menu. Again, this is just a sports bar. There is no explanation of what their \"barrel sauce\" is and, apparently, they put it on everything.

My wife and I wanted to try something new . The place looks nice on the outside and it looks nice on the inside. We order the pretzel appetizer ($6) which comes with about 8 little buttered pretzel nuggets and a spicy nacho cheese in a ramekin. When dipping the pretzels in the cheese, its amazing to pull the pretzel out and find no cheese on it, so a scooping motion is necessary. I guess the cheese won't stick to the butter. It tasted great, but honestly, this is a bar and the warm pretzels should just be served as you're seated as a free item (like bread, you know like Outback Steakhouse, Olive Garden, Texas Roadhouse, Tarbell's, etc...) to get you thirsty and offer the dipping sauce at an additional charge. I can get three times as many pretzel nuggets just as good with cheese for the same price at any pretzel store in any shopping mall. I don't understand why they are so stingy with the portions on such a cheap item to make.

If this was my place, once my customers were seated, I would serve them a tray of hot, unsalted, un-buttered, PLAIN pretzel nuggets. On the tray I would have at least 6 ramekins. One each of kosher salt,  melted butter, spicy cheese, cream cheese, mustard and one with the signature 'barrel sauce.' Let the customers play with the 37+ different flavor combinations at their discretion. This gets them thirsty!! Now the drinks don't seem so over-priced. If the nuggets run out, just like with bread at any other restaurant, ask if they would like more. Some will just want to drink, others may want dinner instead.

For dinner, my wife orders a salad only to find the portion is again too small and the core of the lettuce has been used. At these prices, this is unacceptable. She also orders the chicken tortilla soup and finds it tastes more like a minestrone soup.

I just ordered the chicken wings appetizer, which is advertised on the menu as 'crispy'.

What arrives are not crispy wings. They have a sticky sauce (not hot wings like I expected from the description on the menu) and they cost $9.50 (more than a dollar each) and are covered in scallions. Scallions? On chicken wings? To make it 'fancy' they drizzle this mustard looking sauce on the plate before placing the wings. I ask what that is, and they explain it's their 'barrel sauce' (which is pretty much on every item on the menu). It's an aioli sauce. Something I don't expect on chicken wings. There are also four sticks of celery. Hope you like that barrel sauce they drizzled on the plate before placing the food because its on your celery now, too.

If I wanted the sauce on my celery, I would scrape my celery against the plate where the sauce was. Also, the celery slices were twice the size as the wings. If it's presentation we're talking about, its just bizarre. Did I order celery with a side of wings? 

Why not put it all in a blender and then serve it to me that way? It all ends up that way in our stomach anyway, right? Problem is, our taste buds are not in our stomach or our eyes. Our nose and tongue are what need to be pleased when we eat. From the flavor, the smell and the texture - some things are best left alone or offered as options. Why were the pretzels not already covered in cheese? Because they would be a soggy mess and maybe have too much cheese for someone's taste, or perhaps they prefer them plain. Options, get it? Let people eat the way they want to eat, NOT the way the chef prefers. The chef can make his wings any way he likes, and I'd like that same consideration without having to make a 'special request.'
 
The service and atmosphere were both excellent, but the food just plain sucks. They take something simple, like chicken wings, burgers or grilled chicken sandwiches, dress them up on the menu with a fancy plate and ruin it by removing the simplicity and justifying a higher menu price. In a word, it's pretentious.

Again, the menu was extremely limited. A cowboy place that doesn't offer t-bone steak, but does offer New York and prime rib? That's odd. 

Bottom line, for two sodas and those four small portioned and oddly prepared menu items was $32.86 + I left a $5 tip for the waitress (who was excellent). We both left hungry and will never return.

Notice how many of the positive reviews here are referring to the alcohol. Each alcoholic drink made the way the customer wants, thousands of possible combinations. Ironic, isn't it?"}
{"text":"I was really hungry and really craving ribs after the gym. Came here with the family and loved it! My sister and I had the full rack of ribs and they had a nice spicy sauce and literally fell off the bone. The spicy Mac and cheese has a good kick and is really creamy. We ended it with peach cobbler and a brownie cooked in a skillet. They were amazing."}
{"text":"First time checking the place out. I'm not one who usually enjoys western themed restaurants or bars, but this one is kinda quirky and different and something about it feels inviting and fun. We stopped by for lunch on a Saturday. Not enough people here for some reason....

I was impressed with the menu- they have actual good food not just typical bar food. Their menu seems a bit unique, playing on the modern western theme they have going on with the decor.

The thing that really inspired me to review this place was the quality of the food and service. Never once had to ask for a refill and our server was very attentive. Got the cowboy tacos, and they were like no tacos I'd had before. Western cowboy BBQ meets south of the border. I didn't expect the food to be so, fancy, I guess you could say? Seriously, delicious. Different, in a very good way.

In fact, everything that came out of the kitchen for our lunch was cooked to perfection. Fried pickles and sweet potato fries for appetizers, and the tiny hint of cinnamon and freshness of the sweet potato fries really set them apart. And the fried pickles were still crunchy pickles, not soggy bar food style garbage. My date had the french dip and her fries were perfect and she was really pleased with the sandwich as well.

Both of us walked away impressed and wanting to go back. Sure hope this place does well, because it would be a shame for the location and lack of foot traffic to result in this place not staying open long enough for me to try the other stuff they got on the menu!

Great beer selection too, and the TV set up is perfect for sports fans. Definitely will be back, and highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Go anywhere but here.  My wife and I went to the Barrel Grill last week for dinner and after sitting at the bar for over 10 minutes with not even a hello from the bartenders we decided to leave.  Not only until we got up and started to walk away did the staff recognize us. At that point it was too late. Unfortunately for us this was the second chance we gave the Barrel Grill.  The first time the wait before being acknowledged was just as bad however we continued to wait.  The food was okay but not worth the wait and very poor service.  That being said we will never give the Barrel Grill another opportunity."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times to watch football. Our server was Michelle. She was friendly and quick getting anything we needed. My husband and I really enjoyed to pretzel appetizer and the prime rib sliders. A fun, casual environment. Great drinks too!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places!  Food is wonderful.  Best fries in town!  Service is always friendly and attentive.  Try their house beer too!  We eat here once a week on average."}
{"text":"Went for dinner around 7:30. The restaurant was not very busy.  Staff was friendly, and we were told we could sit where ever we liked. We sat at the bar. We ordered the prime rib, and chicken fried steak.
 Big mistake sitting at the bar and seeing our food sit on the counter in the kitchen for more than a few minutes. Watched a waitress look at it and the slip of paper above it, and walk away empty handed. Thankful it was under a heat lamp, and talk about everyone working as a team. Not tonight!! 
Food was good. Vegetables were done just right. Not overcooked. Good size portions. 
Service was not great, even though they really were not busy. Waited to long for food, and take home box.
 Disappointed they do not offer rolls/bread with their meals."}
{"text":"Happy hour from one till 6 PM on the weekends. That means a special happy hour menu for food and for drinks. The bar is spacious and very comfortable - the stools are the type you could sit on for quite a few hours without your butt falling asleep. Jen was the bartender on this particular Saturday. Yes, she's extremely cute and I have a gigantic crush on her, but she also has a great personality, she knows the drinks that she pours and she will answer all your questions about their menu. 

Try the prime rib sliders, they were excellent. The fried chips & the fried pickles also excellent, however not the healthiest thing in the world. Both are big enough to share with a couple other people.

The Rodeo Cold and Deep Canyon amber beers are only $3 at happy hour and 2 of my faves.

I'm going to call Saturdays from 1 to 6 at this bar, so you'll have to pick another time to come here."}
{"text":"Good service, good food at reasonable cost!!  Not sure what the negatives reviews were about but we would good back.  Loved the patio and the daily specials were nice. Great draft beers and fried pickles."}
{"text":"Found this place just exploring options around Arrowhead today. Loved it! Great food and drinks! Went for lunch during happy hour which is 1pm to 6pm! Also Monday is 2 for 1 moonshine drinks...yum!!! Had a bunch of appetizers on special...the queso dip with homemade potato chips was so good I kinda want to go back for dinner! :) Fresh salads, tasty wings - asked for the spicy sauce on the side so we could taste with or without - good stuff! Pot pie excellent too! Love the decor and music. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the fried pickles & burger this afternoon. The grease was dripping off of everything!!  Worst I've had in years. Do not bother!"}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch today and really liked it! I had the blackened fish sandwich, which was really good. Normally I'm not a huge fan of fish sandwiches but this one was awesome. The ciabatta bun was fresh and soft but crusty on the edges, and the spicy tartar sauce was delicious! The tilapia was really good, and it was a really large fillet. They definitely don't skimp on portions here. The fries were just average.

My fiance got the French Dip, which was also really good, and a side of the southern macaroni and cheese (can't remember exactly what it's called) and it was really good as well. 

The prices are a little on the higher side. I wouldn't say overpriced, but I would suggest making lunch portion sizes and dropping a few dollars for lunch hours. But overall the food was amazing and the atmosphere and decor was fun. The service was good - they had just had a random late lunch rush at 3pm, and our waiter apologized for running around the whole time, but we didn't really even notice. Our food came in an appropriate amount of time and our drinks were refilled often."}
{"text":"Well, that was terrible. 


Wife clipped a coupon from the mail for this place. It was BOGO, so it was hard to pass it up. 

When we walked in we were not greeted by any hostess and the waitresses weren't sure who's turn it was. 

Finally seated, the waitress wondered off for a while without taking drinks orders. I had to fetch a high chair myself. When she came back, we were ready for drinks and a food order, but she ran away with only our drink order. 

A different waitress, who was sitting at another table (on break? She was eating with people) finally checked on us, and then our main one came back for the food order. 
It's been 15 minutes at this point. 

Someone else brings our drinks out. 

Waiting, waiting, and some more waiting, we haven't heard from our waitress or gotten our food. 
Now we are at 45 minutes. 

Mind you we ordered medium prime rib and a medium rare rib eye. 

We finally find the waitress and inquire about the food. 
She heads into the kitchen to check what's going on, and finds the food waiting in the window. (for how long??) 

The steaks were both well done, and the wife's prime rib did not come out with jus or horseradish sauce. 

The waitress did not check on us at all while eating. No refills, no bullsh*t \"how is everything\". 

Then we got the check (and applied the coupon,  thankfully - saved us $22). It took another 10 minutes for her to pick up the book to swipe the card. 

So frustrating, and so disappointing. 


I know that service quality can break a restaurant, and I think it will break this one too."}
{"text":"Came here today for Mothers Day, absolutely the worst service and food I've had in a long time. My wife's French fries were cold and when we asked to have them replaced they brought out ones just as cold. My daughters chicken tenders were rubbery. The fried pickles were good unfortunately that's where it ended. Definitely will not be back which is Sad because the location decor and patio are great."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 but I can't give a half star. The food and atmosphere was pretty good. We had the fried chips, the tacos, and the beer can chicken. The chips were great and the tacos were also good. The chicken itself was great but the veggies came with bell peppers, which I didn't know about. I would have changed the side option if bell peppers were listed as I am slightly allergic. There was also an issue with the patio seating. We sat out on the side patio, which apparently is the smoking patio? There were no signs indicating this was a smoking patio and no ash trays on the tables. There was also a sign on the patio that said \"thank you for not smoking\". However, two men came out to light up. They were polite and left when we indicated that it would bother us since we were eating. About 10 minutes later an employee came out to inform us that this was a smoking patio and that we were being rude to other guests. If we'd had know, we would have sat inside.  There needs to be better indicators about that kind of thing. 

All and all, the restaurant was good despite the confusion. If we come back we'll be sure to not sit outside."}
{"text":"Three stars headed for one star

We have visited a couple of times. First time we had the chips as a starter. They were great and warm when served. Second time they had been pre - made and could have been dumped out of a bag. Really too bad

The service is good. The bar has a homey feeling

The owner and his wife sit at the bar playing on a laptop, they should go in the office or go home.

A woman near us ordered a chicken pot pie that cost $16, amazingly over priced.

If you want to try this place better hurry as I suspect it will not be open long"}
{"text":"We've been back to Barrel a couple of times since my earlier review. Much to our pleasure, any of the previous service issues have been erased. Now, the food is still really good, the folks are still very friendly and helpful and now the perceived disorganization in the service has been remedied. Well done Barrel crew!"}
{"text":"Didn't know that these guys were here and were invited by friends that live in the area.  The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful inside, very upscale and new.  We only sat at the bar for a short while and the place was pretty quiet for a Friday night so we really need to support this place.  We need more upscale bars in this area, have not eaten here or partied here long so will have to come back soon now that I know it is here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I've been impressed both times. Their happy hour is great with a nice selection of local beers. 

They serve food till midnight and their food is GOOD! 

The bartenders/waiters are respectful and professional and this place is clean with a great vibe! 

... And every second Sunday of the month is live music!

I will be here more often now :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with another couple. Went like this.... Prices a little steep for what you get. I had the southwest burger which was small and the side of fries was quite small. Come on, fries are a penny. Load em for us will ya? I don't mind spending good money on a burger, if it's a good burger. It didn't meet the $11 price at all. Wife's salad was ok, nothing special. Don't think we'll be going back to eat, maybe for a drink. The place is fixed up nice."}
{"text":"I just went in with my wife and we had a great meal.  The food was hot and tasty, the service was really friendly and fast and the place is really cool!  They have a neat outdoor patio and this giant bar when you go in.  They also have really comfy booths too.  There are TVs to watch the sports but they are not on with sound so they don't bother you during conversation.  This was a great place to go and have some fun."}
{"text":"Once more, Barrel Grill has me conflicted and has forced my hand into updating this review yet again. I can't keep the 5 stars in good conscience after my last couple of bad experiences, because as much as I dearly want to support this place, it simply wouldn't be honest. 

So what's happened? Executive summary is that the inconsistencies with the food have gotten ridiculous. 

For starters, no pun intended, there have been repeated problems getting the simplest of their appetizers to come out right, namely the pretzel bites. I order them without butter, because as I stated, the cheese will not stick because of the butter and prefer them without. We visited dozens of times and no problem with that at all. Suddenly, and repeatedly, they started coming out completely soggy and falling apart. After having to send back a double order not once, but also the second time it came out for the same reason, it was conceded to us that there had been changes in the kitchen and apparently the new guy thought it would make sense to put WATER on the butter-less pretzel to make the salt stick to it. No, I'm not kidding. The third order finally came out right, which I suppose is OK until you consider the fact that by that point we were half way done with our dinner. 

On a subsequent visit,  after explaining in detail the problems we had and wanting to get it right on the first rather than the third try, we were once again forced to send them back because this time they weren't completely cooked. Turns out they cook it part way, throw the butter and salt on, then finish cooking it, so when I ordered without butter, somehow they interpret this to mean I want them half-cooked as well. They actually brought me a plate with some of them still cold to the touch. Is this rocket science? Come on. And, salt in the wound, happy hour price on these babies has gone up from $3 (half price) to $5, which is barely more than 15% off. What the hell? 

My main gripe, again no pun intended, is the ribs. My beloved ribs, coming in at about $15 a plate, was once my favorite dish. I've ordered it dozens of times. Shortly after the aforementioned staff change in the kitchen, I've had not one but TWO instances where my ribs came out absolutely ruined. The first time they were completely gray and cooked to death, we're talking pork chop consistency here, which I literally had to saw off the bone. If it had been a one off, I'd have let it go, but on our most recent visit, it happened again and, although not quite as bad as the first time, this time I sent them back and asked for an explanation. The server returned and told me that, per the chef, \"They're all cooked this way tonight,\" and handed me a menu to select something else instead. Seriously? For $15 a pop you pre-cook your ribs to death and then serve me something that tastes like dark chicken meat (and looks like it too) and when I send it back, you tell me that's how it is, pick something else because we can't cook ribs properly tonight? Wow, just... wow. Never had that happen at another restaurant in my life, talk about embarrassing.  

I'm now at a crossroads with this place, because I can't seem to get my favorite appetizer without having to worry that asking for no butter will get me either water logged or half cooked pretzels. I also can't order my favorite entree without the potential to be served a completely overcooked (or is that over pre-cooked?) slab that needs to be sawed off the bone and tastes like a pork chop. 

I understand they've got changes going on in the kitchen, and more than a couple servers (and multiple managers) have conceded this, but throw me a freaking bone here guys. I am trying so hard to like this place and I keep going back and even bringing colleagues here with their families, but I'm ashamed of how many times I've had to send things back recently. I'm even more ashamed that I have to pick something else to eat because they're unwilling to acknowledge that what they served was completely botched, and unable to cook it properly. I was offered free dessert on most occasions when I sent food back, or free appetizers, but I've always refused. I don't want free food, I just want the problem fixed. That doesn't seem to be happening, however. 

I'd really love to revise this back up to 5-stars someday if the inconsistency goes away, but right now I'm pretty unhappy and borderline afraid to go back, because it is embarrassing to send food back this often. Considering I've been going to this place pretty much on a weekly basis since I heard about them, it says a lot that I'm now apprehensive about going back for fear that I'll have to look like an ass for sending food back every other visit. It's not MY standard they're failing to live up to, its their own, and that's pretty sad."}
{"text":"Great  French dip & zucchini. Fry's could have been more  crispy for me. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We came here to kill time before we could ice skate, \"we\" meaning my wife and our daughter.  

Our order: 

Prime Rib sandwich w/ au jus---Great and the French Fries should be called \"Crack Fries.\"

Southwest Burger---great, hamburger and the wife said it was pretty spicy.  

Sloppy Joe---Just like when I was a kid.  My daughter loved it.  

Also, I ordered the White Lightning.  Moonshine with Red Bull.  Great drink. It sneaks up on you.  I only had one, but I could feel a buzz.  I could see myself drinking these these like water.  

Great place. We will come again."}
{"text":"It was an ok burger. The service was decent. Pretty average food, but it looks like a good spot for a beer and sports."}
{"text":"It's refreshing to see a unique concept on the west side of town. The owner hit the nail on the head describing the concept as a MODERN saloon. Western with clean edges and updated takes on classic dishes. Was also pleasantly surprised by their signature cocktails and draft beer selection. Will definitely be dinning here again."}
{"text":"If you want a GREAT Rib eye!  This is the place!  Great atmosphere, super service!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times and never been disappointed with the food or service. The girls that work here have always been nice and accommodating. I get the same meal every time I come, the chicken wrap with fries and a pizza cookie. It always tastes great and never disappoints. My only complaint is how HOT it is in there. I don't know if the ac isn't working well or they're just cheap but it's reason enough for me to not come here unless it's cooler outside."}
{"text":"What a disaster.  Full disclosure: we were a party of 30 in town for a hockey tournament.  But the place is located next to the rink and it was a big tournament weekend.  Shouldn't they have been staffed?
After waiting 2 hours for my lunch -soup and salad- to show, I cut my losses and left.  Servers were slow disorganized and surly."}
{"text":"The staff clearly are working hard to give good service. We were served our food after 3 other tables that came later. The staff were aware and very apologetic. We shared a Mac and Cheese for a starter, very good, no complaints. I had a half a French dip and chili. Both were just ok, no real complaint but just ok. We asked if the tea was sweetened, told yes, it was not. My husband had the sloppy joe which he said was good. The space was nice, clean and well decorated. Just ok in my book, was hoping the chili and sandwich just would of been more flavorful. Close but just missing the mark."}
{"text":"So we have been here several times and had a great time. Great food great drinks the whole 9 yards. We stopped by and had a great dinner and had my absolute favorite beer on tap from Sleepy Dogs Brewery out of Tempe their Red Rover! Then the kids showed up with their parents that don't understand that kids don't belong at a Bar and especially sitting at the bar by them selves watching TV. I watched a few couple come in and hear that noise from the gaggle of children and were like what the F is that! I do not blame the restaurant just the dumdass parents!"}
{"text":"Moonshine cocktails are perfect for cooling off after spicy mac, buffalo chips or southwest burger. Love the cherry limeade moonshine drink.  

This place is to the left of spicy, so cowboy beware!  It sure could light your campfire if you get too adventurous with the spice level, but oh it's so good!   We visited for my sister's birthday and it was their daughter's first trip out of the house, at 6 days old.  The restaurant was slow, for a Wednesday night, so our food was hot, fresh and fast.  Sis had a birthday coupon for joining their club and it was quite generous at $25 off your meal, no minimum!  (just not on alcohol)

Great place. Glad we went."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Sunday brunch and it was excellent. We loved the decor and the enjoyed watching Sunday morning football on multiple TV screens. Michelle was our server and she did an excellent job. She was knowledgeable about the menu choices and very attentive. Her bright smile and infectious personality made our visit very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"What I like the most about this place is the decor and vibe. It has a very nice relaxed feel and is a great place if you have kids to feed. Although, I can see it getting very \"country\" at times, when I was there if felt more like a sports themed establishment

The staff was friendly, not really quick, but it looked like there was only one server at the time. The place was clean, including the bathrooms, which I tend to put very high on my rating list.

Nothing really made me go \"Wow!\" at this place, but I have no complaints at the same time. They had a decent draft beer selection and lots of house cocktails that would appeal to anyone. 

The food was good, we just ordered a couple burgers and their queso appetizer. Burgers cooked to order, queso came with house made chips, everything was tasty and filling. 

If I am in the area again I would definitely go back. A worthy establishment if you are looking for a new place to go."}
{"text":"I cannot just say \"I\"... I have to say \"we\" as a family love this place! It is not for the atmosphere, but rather each meal we have tried has been great! My kids are slightly picky eaters, and both have never complained. We all enjoy the interchangeable choice of sports on tv and the bartender gals make sure my hubby and I's glass is always 1/2 full"}
{"text":"Wasn't too impressed with the food....definitely won't really be coming back for dinner anytime...but...THE MOONSHINE DRINKS ARE AMAZING. The staff is great, and the atmosphere is comfortable, so I definitely will be back for some happy hours!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it was our first time here and on a Sunday and I didn't have high expectations, but it was so amazing! Live music, moonshine and the atmosphere was awesome, if you like country music and have that in you, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Super good wings..happy hour menu great deal.  Good food for price.  Love happy hour here!!"}
{"text":"Was here for a lunch meeting. Okay place. Server was attentive and efficient. 
Food tasted okay, but all of us agreed it was overpriced for what was delivered. One person commented his \"Ranch Hand Steak Salad\" had very little steak and what was in the salad looked like the frozen Philly cheese steak meat you can buy at the grocery store."}
{"text":"This is my second time here with my family of 4 and didn't even get a drink order or any acknowledgment after 15+ minutes of waiting.  So we got up and went right next door to Humble Pie."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed appetizers and drinks there. Staff was nice and welcoming, they had an outside patio and brought our fog and she was treated well.  The food and service was great....sad it closed."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after gymnastics with my 3 kids and husband. Service was great, our waitress was very attentive. We ordered the cowboy wings for an appetizer and they were fantastic. I ordered the cowboy tacos. They're made with prime rib, spicy cabbage, pico de gallo and black beans. Three small street taco size. They were very good. My husband ordered the sloppy joe and fries and he enjoyed it as well calling it a sweet sloppy joe. Kids meals were priced well and good serving size for any age. I would definitely come back. I want to try the chicken pot pie next."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now with friends and the experience has been fantastic each and every time. The mac and cheese is to die for, their drinks are amazing, and nobody at our table had any complaints about the food. The service has been top notch as well. We had one experience where my boyfriend was just lifting up his empty plate to try to find someplace on the crowded table to put it, and our server was just coming out of the kitchen. She saw him lifting the empty plate and practically LUNGED our way to take it out of his hands and out of the way. She almost appeared out of nowhere. We like to try new restaurants and places, but it's kind of hard each weekend when we try to pick a new place when this one is so good that we just want to keep coming back!"}
