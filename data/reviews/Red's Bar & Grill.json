{"text":"i had some onion rings, they were very greasy otherwise ok. i ordered the fish and chips, also very greasy and the fish was mushy. i asked for tarter sauce and not available, also did not get the malt vinegar stated on your menue. the prickely pear margarita was ok.  i was not impressed and i will not be ordering the fish again. the patio area was great and our waitress was very good."}
{"text":"Great casual restaurant.  We recently stayed at the Wigwam Resort.  we had an excellent room, very clean.  We tried Reds Bar and Grill, and found the atmosphere AND food was excellent.  Great Burgers. cooked to order. .  Try the wings too.  Excellent.   Waitstaff was very friendly.  Chef Jason came out to our table to say hello.   Seems to be a professionally run, fun, friendly establishment."}
{"text":"Food was good and the waitress was helpful, but the manager did not have any people skills and did not have the time to talk to us about a question we had on the bill. Over $2 Red's lost a local customer."}
{"text":"Had to look for someone to get us a drink after golf. Were told the Ultimate Nachos were great, NOT. Sent them back, second order was just as bad as the first batch missing the guacamole because they said we ate that on the first go around. This is a 5 star resort? I think not.  Not a wasted day, though, the golf was good, cart girl, great!"}
{"text":"Had appetizers for an early dinner. Food was good. Wine selection was OK but some wines were not available. Server knew nothing about wines. When we asked for the brut rose she explained it was not available and suggested that the white Zinfandel was a substitute! The beer list was extensive. Beware of their priorities."}
{"text":"I had the hamburger. Ordered medium. It came #1raw, #2 well done.  Overpriced, uncomfortable situation seats. Services mediocre. Not worth return ing"}
{"text":"This was the best service I have ever received. It started with the host, Jesse. He made eye contact the whole time while he seated us promptly. He asked whether we preferred a booth or table. I never get that anywhere. Next, he didn't assume that my daughter wanted to eat off the kids menu. It's like he read my mind! If that wasn't good enough, Ashlee was our waitress. As I mentioned, my daughter was with me, and she started a conversation with, even crouched down for her. She was patient and very attentive. What an awesome experience!!! I love this place."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant!  Sadly it was a disappointment.  The burgers are way over priced for what they are!  Tasteless, really no seasoning what so ever!  Beautiful presentation, fries were good the kids Mac and cheese was decent but $80 for lunch...? Then there was the fly issue and no we didn't eat outside!  Unfortunately my family and I will not return.  There's just too many burger joints or there to choose from that are cheaper and quite frankly better... Sorry Reds really wanted to love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This restaurant could receive 4-5 stars for the kindness of our server and food. But unfortunately the manager left a bad impression. As for the manager working, a tall blonde woman, she could not have seemed more like a proper b****. I feel bad for the staff who has to work with her, as she seems very unapproachable and with my brief interaction with her she lived up to the look she had on her face."}
{"text":"Have been twice in recent weeks. Service is abysmal. Kitchen is slow. Menu is dull and poorly executed. Our food took an hour. Server rarely showed up.  How can the launch after the remodel be so truly horrible.  Skip this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent service all around and a great selection of food. Love the tuna sandwich with grilled tuna.  Our hats go off to Jillian our server. Very fun and easy going place to get some great food and drink. We keep coming back."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a new place to eat  Sunday breakfast... I have been to just about all the other places and they have been OK but I was still looking... Until now...  I have found my place...I have to admit Reds bar and grill doesn't scream good breakfast but it's perfect for me...  close to home.... good food... quick service.. no waiting... and a fair price..."}
{"text":"Second visit and the experience was excellent. Everybody was friendly and welcoming beginning with Jesse our maitre d'. Our waitress refilled our drinks and then elected to leave the carafe so we could refill at our leisure. We were there for lunch and found the food to be flavorful and perfectly prepared. As it was lunch the cost was also very reasonable. The patio was well laid out without being overcrowded with plenty of umbrellas provided lots of shade. You were encouraged to choose from all of the tables rather than being seated at the staffs convenience. This allowed the meal to commence with a reasonable amount of privacy and made conversation easy without having to raise your voice. Congratulations has to be given to the group of women golfers who were celebrating a hole-in-one at the end of their round. They were rightly animated in their celebrations which made our conversation a little difficult to keep up. But we were on the patio, at a top golf courses and I can't imagine the noise I'd be making if I had got that elusive hole-in-one. So it was fun to be able to share their enjoyment. So to conclude. The second visit and a successful one across the board. Good food, good weather and good company and all at a fair price. Would I come back? Definitely. Reds is quietly becoming a favorite."}
{"text":"This is also called Red Allens. Beware. The service was not good. The salad was good, the main course was not quite palatable. They do NOT accept open table, even though we made our reservation on OT, and were seated on OT. This is not OT's fault, but the management did not have a clue. It was embarassing being chased from our table, and the manager had no smarts in handling the situation of us paying by an open table check. The difference between Litchfields restaurant and Red Allens is huge. I believe I am forced to give Red Allens one star."}
{"text":"Made reservations for a nice night out with the family for a special occasion only to find out our fire table was not reserved for us even after calling two times to confirm.  Sat outside freezing our tails off until a table was free only to find that the restaurant staff couldn't put a reserved sign on it, literally had to fight off all the other freezing patrons from snatching the table right out from under us and the staff.  Our waiter was horrible and inattentive, didn't ask us how our food was or refilled our drinks, outright disappeared at times and we had to go find him, pathetic.  Complained to manager several times only to be greeted by a full bill at the end if the lackluster cold food served to us.  Horrible food, service and experience, don't bother \"reserving\" anything here, I thought this was a nice place but I was wrong"}
{"text":"Second time here, just for drinks this time and no complaints! Our waitress (name started with an A dangit cant remember) was great dealing with our mixed crowd, table changes and drink orders!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Not to many places out in the west side that have a decent brunch and mimosa. Love to sit outside and enjoy the golf course view."}
{"text":"Stopped in Red's Bar & Grill located in Litchfield Park, Arizona  and ordered a suggested flat of beer with an \"Arizona Burger\".  The appetizer we chose were the Onion rings.  Absolutely   mouthwatering.  My partner ordered   The Blue Burger with sweet potato fries.  The food was amazing and our waitress was the \"sweetest\".  Waitress, ASHLEE, recommended the beer which was an outstanding  choice and  made us feel very comfortable and relaxed. Her service was exceptional."}
{"text":"I just had Battered Mahi Mahi Tacos at The Grill for lunch.  It was unremarkable.  I wasn't seated at the best table either with any sort of view of the golf course.  http://www.wigwamresort.com/meetingsbrochure/pdf/GrillLunchMenu.pdf  Notes:  They accept most credit cards, except American Express.  Parking is across from The Grill in the parking lot on N Old Litchfield Rd."}
{"text":"Celebrating a big birthday with family. A pretty large group and our waiter \"Hunter\" was totally awesome throughout the entire evening.  We will all return just so that we can visit with Hunter again!  Woohoo!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give the grill a try while staying at the Wigwam, after reading about it in the room magazine. We had ceasar salads that were great to start.  I had Chef Matt's burger. It was one if the best tasting burgers I have ever had. It came with very thick cut bacon, onions, lettuce, and the best part, a Guiness and honey reduction sauce that I would have taken home by the gallon. My wife had the Kobe meatloaf. It was also amazing. It came atop mashed potatoes and with a gravy that was simply awesome. The whole combo was mouthwatering. We will definitely go back. Possibly tomorrow."}
{"text":"We went here for Easter brunch, first time there after the renovations.  It has a more modern yet still western feel.  The brunch is great and the manager was very accommodating at getting our large party a nice table outside.  Everything you want for brunch, without being overwhelming.  We had East Coast visitors and they were thrilled!  Beautiful outdoor patio and view of the golf course.  We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best burgers in town.  Just left Red's where we enjoyed the Restaurant Week Special, app, two burgers  and two desserts for $33.00. Perfect medium rare, solid bun, great smoked bacon.  I had the Red Eye and El Jeffe, the Arizona Burger. Special shout out to Ashlee who provided some of the best service we have had in a long time.  If you go order the Tachos not on the menu, tater tots, queso, Pico and jalape√±o, yum."}
{"text":"Disappointing... run by a bunch of kids... drinks horribly watered down.. my wife ordered wine.. they don't even know the difference between a red and white wine... sadly... disappointing ... NEVER AGAIN.."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes at hostess stand to be seated, no one showed. Sat ourselves at the bar amongst other guests, where a manager was stocking beer. No greeting from manager even. Wait another 10 minutes to see other guests looking around for service as well, but no showing of a bartender, server or even the previously seen manager. Sad showing from such high expectations."}
{"text":"Came to Red's to celebrate our niece's birthday. Large party of about 18 adults and kids. Hunter provided excellent service throughout the entire evening. Service and food were fabulous!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast at Red's after spending July 3rd at the Wigwam Resort.  (Wigwam delivered as expected!).  The omelet bar was down so we ordered off the menu.  Wait staff was courteous, attentive, and the food was good.  Nice breakfast in a nice setting, perfect for the after holiday celebrations."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant at 8 p.m. on Friday night(2 adults and 2 kids) and there was maybe six tables with people eating and that includes at the bar and outside patio.The first thing you notice is how hot it is inside the restaurant, there was fans running but we were sitting by the thermostat and it was 76 degrees inside the restaurant.  There was NO air in the restrooms,  I felt like I walked into the oven- soo groose!The place was pretty clean but it was just so hot that it makes you wonder how they're storing the food because even the waiters were sweating.  We sat down and ordered two drinks from the bar and a couple of kids drinks and they came out pretty fast. We ordered within the first maybe 10 minutes that we were there and the kids were starving. We ordered the Steak Fritas (Medium/Rare), pulled pork sliders, cheeseburger and kids mac and cheese with a side salad and that was requested to come out first. 20 minutes after we had ordered I had to ask the waitress where the salad was and she said well there is a large party that there are plating and that's what was taking so long. The large party was one of two tables waiting for food and they had four adults and two kids. So we're trying to be patient but finally at about 35 minutes, I asked where the food was and they gave me the excuse again about the large table but there are literally the only table waiting for food other than us. Finally 45 minutes after we ordered the food comes out. My steak that I ordered had charcoal on it it was so well done, the cheeseburger had charcoal on it as well it was dry and the bun was like old cuz it was just falling apart, the pork sliders we're dry but they were okay.  So, in between us waiting on the food the manager came and awkwardly stood there and stared at us and said what's the problem. And I explained that it been about 40 minutes at that point and he goes well what did you order because apparently that matters. I said we'll steak and burger and he goes well how did you want your steak. Again and I told him what does that matter because  it's been 40 minutes, so in between awkward pauses and him staring at us the food came out. I looked down at my charcoal steak and I looked at him and said this is kind of well done and he goes again, \"Well didn't you order that?\" Umm really, no i didn't order a Burnt Steak, could barely cut into it, it was SO well done! He awkwardly  offered to make a new steak but at that point I wasn't willing to wait another 15 minutes for a steak(per manager) and I honestly wasn't even hungry tomorrow just wanted to get out of there because it was so freaking hot. So, I told him no thank you- 3 times and he still awkwardly stood there and then he looked at my husband and asked my husband- as if that was going to change anything. Don't get me wrong he was nice but he had no skills to deal with unhappy people in a restaurant and it was very awkward.  I get having to wait 45 minutes for food and a table when it's super busy but it was dead and there was tons of waiters and waitresses just hanging out and standing around. There's just no reason the food should come out that awful. The manager did comp my meal and my husband's pork sandwiches so that did make a huge difference at least we'd have to pay for the bad food. We're going to be here for at least 3 days and we definitely will not be going back. Hopefully they read this review and turn on the air conditioner cuz there is no reason a restaurant should be that warm inside and they need to work on the timing of their food and the quality/ taste."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my wife and friends.  It was superb and Ashlee, our waitress was outstanding."}
{"text":"So the only reason why I gave this place two stars is because my eggs Benedict was OK and the atmosphere was nice, the rest of the food was mediocre, hubby had Belgian waffle, another guest had pancakes and our fourth had the French toast, so the main reason for the low rating was that the service was horrible and they were not even busy!!! I received my eggs Benedict and another person got their French toast... then almost half hour later the rest of our dining party got the pancakes and waffle?!?! Wtf?? It doesn't take half hour to make pancakes and a Belgian waffle???? The table next to us that arrive half hour later than we did received their food all at once before we got all our food!!! Anyways manager was nice enough to comp one of our meals... but honestly I rather pay for my meal so we can all eat together... that's why people go out to eat together right??? Anyways, I would have overlooked their horrible service if it was super busy or their food was amazing.... but I could have invited my out of town guests to my home and made a better meal  not going back horrible experience and mediocre food."}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour last night with another couple and couldn't be happier with our experience! Ashlee was our server and on top of things, answering our questions patiently and seeming to enjoy her job! We had the Arizona and Blue burgers, both very tasty and large. The Caesar salad had tater tots for croutons which were a fun addition. House wines were $5 and reasonable beers on tap too. Wouldn't pay extra again for the 4 onion rings, French fries were awesome. This was actually our second time to Red's, the first time being for brunch. We arrived after they had stopped serving it but they allowed us to eat anyway since the food was still out. Had a relaxing time eating outside watching the golfers go by. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good.  Drinks are a little pricey  but the atmosphere mitigates some of that.  Folks are friendly here but it can be a little slow on the service.  The breakfast buffet is the absolute best in Phoenix.  Excellent 5 star quality for a buffet.  We come here quite frequently and wanted to give a shout out.  A couple ways to improve have more drink specials.  Have more options on the menu and bring back the tater tots.   Oh and the chicken nachos and Korean Wings are extremely good."}
{"text":"Love this place. We especially love that they have a \"kid friendly play area.\" I mean hiring a baby-sitter sometimes isn't that easy- but why not bring your kids to RED'S since they can hang out in the \"kid\" lounge while you and your spouse have a little cocktail!? It's the best! Video games, Legos, Netflix and the Disney Channel. It doesn't get better than that!  Now the food. Not bad either. Nachos are pretty tasty. We recently had the avocado hummus and it really did wow me. For a person who doesn't like either this was the perfect combination! Certain things on the appetizer menu are only $6 too during happy hour so theres another plus! The kids enjoyed the creamy Mac n cheese while we enjoyed the chicken spinach salad and the bbq pulled pork flatbread.  We really enjoyed the laid back feel, with all the TVs around. The hostesses were very sweet and our server was very friendly and made great suggestions. (Like why pay $14 for two kids meals when you can order an adult portion, which is actually a lot more, for $3-$4 less) We love this place and my kids can't wait to go back. Lol!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere on the patio. Amazing burgers and sandwiches. Decent prices as well."}
{"text":"We had dinner and drinks at Red's after a long day of sightseeing around Phoenix. Everyone in our group was extremely pleased with what they ordered, as well as the exceptional service provided by our waiter, Sam. I had the nachos and the peanut butter ice cream cookie dessert and they were both delicious and enough to share. Two other members of our party got the special deal - sliders and a beer flight, which was quite good value (under $20) and also very tasty. The setting on the patio was beautiful as well. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The 4 or 5 times I've been to Red's over the years have all been very poor experiences. Why did I go back that many time? Great question, but I did. Service is among the worst -- this is seemingly due to being understaffed so no one is able to refill drinks and visits to your table number around 2 or 3 for the entire stay (plan on 20 minutes to get your check after you ask for it). I have never had a good meal there -- ever. And the last visit one of the people I was with got food poisoning and was sick the entire next day."}
{"text":"I was hoping to get a burger more like the picture I saw... it was still REALLY good, but not great. Bartender was awesome, very friendly. This place has a crappy location and boring interior, if this was closer to Litchfield it would probably explode.  A couple beers and huge burger for $20, hard to complain. I'll likely be back for that burger again."}
{"text":"Great beer selection on tap.  That was the highlight. The hot wings were  lousy because they were loaded with salt.  My girlfriend and I know wings and she stopped at her first wing.  I ate a few more because I'm a guy but couldn't get over the salt and left half.  I always eat all My wings. When the bartender ask how the wings were, I let him know.  There wasn't an interest or any kind of response from him and just assumed no one really wants the feedback. Nice guy but not sure the wigwam really cares to listen.   They did a nice job on the re-model though.  We also had fish tacos.  She liked them, I was unimpressed. You get three deep fried frozen fish strips and some corn on a corn tortilla.  All in all, I will not be returning.    Good luck."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going here for an early dinner out on the back patio. I think it's great that I've seen both children and pups around. I've had great service each time I've gone and the food has been delicious.  My faves so far: (1) the arugula salad - it's a delicious combination of arugula, watermelon, cucumber, red onion and cotija cheese with a refreshing citrus vinaigrette YUM!  I've also had the chicken pesto flatbread that is mighty tasty as well.  Large enough to share and just the right combination of softness and thickness on the flatbread. They drizzle a bit of balsamic on right at the end :)  Lastly, the fish tacos appetizer is another favorite of mine - perfect fish batter, 3 small tacos....really nice and light!  My husband says the hamburgers rock but I am not a burger fan so I'll have to take his word for it.  Would have given it 5 stars but I think they could use some misters running on the back patio."}
{"text":"Love going there for happy hour on the patio overlooking the golf course!  Brunch is great too!"}
{"text":"Keep waiting for this place to act the part and be the best sports bar on the west side. Good bar food even though menu hasn't changed in 3 years and awesome optics facing the course.  Place would be perfect if u didn't have to order food or drink. Service is terrible terrible terrible... terrible.  Ordered nachos over an hour ago in a near empty establishment and still waiting. Bartender realized oversight and offered to pay for them. Not kidding maybe 10 other people in entire place. Started imagining who might be manning the kitchen this Memorial Day weekend and took a pass.  Very obvious there is no management here. They are focused on resort and could care less about this place, and it shows. Not sure how that is working out for them since I have been to resort and let's just say...it ain't no four seasons.  Keep hoping this place could turn into an awesome west side hangout because it is seriously in the best place it could be, facing that course with lots of natural light for happy hour, but every time I'm there I leave feeling neglected.  So will u."}
{"text":"as soon as I walked in, Jesse was there and made my whole day, truly the sweetest man! I ordered the Jesse burger (named after him since he has been working there for 46 years) and without exaggerating it was the absolute best burger I've ever had in my entire life. oh my goodness best burger!!! our server was very kind and friendly. great service and great food! coming back again :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends Monday night.  Wait person was very nice and professional.  However after waiting nearly 45 minutes for burgers and salads, I made inquiry about what was taking so long.  The other wait person on duty took issue with my question, instead of apologizing for delay.  The room was nearly empty, wait was unnecessary.  They really need to address kitchen efficiencies.   They do have the best enchilada plate on the block. Love the outside patio!"}
{"text":"Definitely a huge difference from litchfields. Although I LOVE litchfields this was a cool little kick back spot. Very chill. My husband and I sat on the patio with the fire and it was beautiful. Our server and hostess were very sweet. I ordered the spicy burger it was good! If you are looking for a kick back spot to have drinks or burgers I recommend reds!"}
{"text":"***Red's is a surprisingly good breakfast and lunch spot for a resort hotel***  Red's Bar & Grill is the casual restaurant and bar next to the golf course at the Wigwam--a hotel, golf, tennis, and spa resort near Phoenix.  I tend to avoid resort restaurants, but I was at this resort without a car so I gave this resort's casual restaurant a try for breakfast and lunch.  I tried them first for lunch.  They recently revamped their menu and it offers a mix of casual and not too expensive gastropub lunchtime fare--hearty starters and a collection of sandwiches including a few burgers.  I started with the bacon and beer cheese dip with pretzel bites.  The warm cheese dip was good as it had a good salty note as well as a smoky flavor from the bacon.  The cheese dip was creamy and had a thickness without being overly heavy or rich.  The dip was topped with green onions, which provided sharpness.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/reds-bar-and-grill-litchfield-park-2?select=UUZHGUneB7XP1Y9v0CWd4A#9w-QtLsLe_BVUhOMchrv1A  The pretzel bites were warm, buttery and not too salty.  They varied in quality though.  Some were too small and kind of hard while others had a nice light and soft quality to them.  For my entree, I had the Southern Bird, which was a satisfying turkey burger.  What made the turkey burger shine the most were the garnishes.  The lettuce and tomato were both fresh.  I also enjoyed the lightly sweet but also slightly spicy BBQ sauce.  The fried pickles provided an indulgent crunch and fried component to the burger as well as a little bit of tanginess from the pickles.  There was also melted cheese though I do not think cheese always works with turkey burgers.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/reds-bar-and-grill-litchfield-park-2?select=UUZHGUneB7XP1Y9v0CWd4A#80b_lNUkJCOLHODY-2r8oA  The turkey patty itself was slightly moist though definitely not as moist as an expertly prepared medium rare burger patty.  The turkey patty though had a good amount of flavor due to the aggressive seasoning of it.  The burger sat on a fresh whole wheat bun.  The bun provided a sturdy structure for the burger and all of the toppings so it could be eaten as a sandwich and not something with a knife and fork.  The burger came with fries and they were excellent--hot and crisp on the outside but still soft on the inside.  Dessert was disappointing.  I had dessert flautas, which were fried pastries filled with brownies, nuts and marshmallows.  The flautas were paired with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  The brownie flavor was decent and it was nice to have a warm dessert.  This was supposed to a rocky road-like experience, but the flavor of the nuts and marshmallow were not really there.  In addition, the flauta pastry was not crispy enough (it was actually quite soft and almost burrito tortilla-like).  I also tried Red's for breakfast and had their Southwest Loco Moco, which was Sonoran rice mixed with chorizo and ranchero sauce.  The rice mixture was topped with poached eggs, cotija cheese and sour cream.  The flavors were all delicious.  The poached eggs were nicely done so that the yolk provided a thick and creamy sauce for the dish.  The chorizo was moist and meaty.  The rice was cooked to the right texture and all of the sauces and creams and chorizo combined to provide a spicy and savory breakfast dish.  There were a few areas where it could have been better though.  The dish was very soft.  Loco moco is too, but I think I would have preferred some crispy and crunchy textures here to provide variety to the hearty and comforting dish.  In addition, the temperature was a little uneven as some elements were hot while other ingredients (like parts of the rice) were lukewarm to even slightly cold.  The dining room at Red's works.  It is comfortable and suitable for various party sizes.  It is also casual while still having a slightly upscale feel making it a good contemporary gastropub option.  If you sit outside, you get nice views of the golf course.  I found the service to be very personable and friendly.  I also felt the food came out at a quick pace.  The waitstaff did not check in as much as other places I have been to and I think this was due to the shortage of staff.  I did not think it impacted the experience that much though I did witness one very unhappy couple who seemed to have longer than expected wait times for food and service.  Prices were reasonable.  Portions are generous and you do not have to pay the ridiculous prices that you often have to pay at a resort or even just a hotel for that matter.  Overall, I liked Red's.  The food would not compete against top gastropubs I have been to across the country.  But for the area, I felt the flavors and quality of their food would probably be above most of their nearby competition.  If you are staying at this resort or playing golf, I think Red's is a satisfying option for breakfast or lunch.  I believe free parking is available."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight and used a Groupon deal. We got fried pickles ($1 off during happy hour and they are awesome), the IPA pork burger (so freaking good!), the chicken & peppers sandwich (really good), fries (really good), and the chocolate chip ice cream sandwich (amazing). Everything was so DELICIOUS! The outdoor patio is great...especially in the evening since the weather is getting cooler... and it's right on the golf course. We loved this place and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Food: I ended up just getting couple apps here during happy hour. I got the fish tacos and pretzel with cheese. The fish taco was pretty decent. The pretzel with cheese was pretty generic. Kinda reminded me of the ones you sample at Costco.   Service: This is the main reason this place got only 2 stars. Very slow service, I had to waive someone down to get a table then it took awhile to get a waitress after we were seated. The person that waited on us, did not seem like she wanted to be there. Didn't provide any happy hour information until we asked and then they blurted eveything out. Only heard two things, which is why i only got the apps. Ended going somewhere else for the rest of my meals. Probably won't be going back there. Hope you guys have better service."}
{"text":"After a morning hike we returned to the resort for some food.  We decided to come here since it was close to the clubhouse so my fiance could golf the gold course.  We sat outside and it was very peaceful- they had a lot of umbrellas to keep your area shady.    We ordered the flatbread to start- which was just ok.  My friend and I split the cobb salad and turkey club.  Very good but the bun was super greasy.  My fiance had the burger.  I liked that the chef uses a lot of fresh and locally grown products.  The fries were really good and tasted fresh too.   One cool thing I liked (kinda random) was there are tv screens in the mirrors within the bathroom...ha.  I think this would be a nice place to go after or before golfing.  It seems like the outside you can get away with wearing whatever you want but inside it looked to be a little more fancier... my gym shorts and sweaty t-shirt didn't really fit the dress code for inside."}
{"text":"The fries were stale. My pulled pork sliders were ok, but it seemed like they were on a dry breakfast biscuit. Pretzel app was good, drinks too. Service started off well but then tapered off. Luckily we can in a Groupon - was certainly not worth the price."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were great, Mac and cheese was great, and burger was good. The service was awkward... Service took long and servers didn't seem to know what was going on."}
{"text":"Great place after the renovation.  Good beer selection and seriously the BEST burgers but they do need more variety on the menu. Good overall prices (not like $$$ W Bar) and good HH and you can't beat the atmosphere.  Beautiful patio on the course with fire pits. Gorgeous in the evening.  And I hear they have a breakfast buffett but I need to check on that."}
{"text":"Great food! Good variety of beers on tap! Family friendly with games for the kids! beautiful patio that is an escape from the desert!"}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon to try this place and was not disappointed. Went here with my wife and had one of the best burgers I've had in a while. We really appreciated our service too Ashlee with two E' s was great, thanks again. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Another bad west Valley experience order medium and got da hockey puck hamburger soggy bottom frys. You think for a nice resort they have good food. Service was good.. pass on this one..."}
{"text":"I was at the Wigwam volunteering for a golf tournament and killed some time in Red's Allen's.  We were the only ones in the bar area, so we got awesome service.  We ordered a light breakfast, but there was a big buffet available.  Little pricing, but hey, what do you expect from a nice golf course?  TVs were all over the bar...mainly with golf channels on. The view from the bar is beautiful and over looks the course.  I hope I have another excuse to go back."}
{"text":"Wow what an improvement and what a change.    Not only the decor but the service is amazing.   The family and I have tried the new Reds on several occasions for both lunch and breakfast.   I rate it one of the top in the west valley.   They've figured out the service side which is lacking at nearly every west valley establishment.    The food was also great.    The new Reds should help up every restaurant owners game I the Litchfield Park area - great food great atmosphere and great service.  Kudos keep it up."}
{"text":"Service was awesome!!! Ashlee was great! Wonderful personality and great recommendations! We had ribs, enchiladas and fish and chips. Our only complaint is the fish and chips keep getting smaller and smaller. Everything else was perfect we will be back! Highly recommend asking for Ashlee's section if you come!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this out on a deal. The food was great. The place was quiet, but it is at the Wigwam off season, and we didn't mind. The Arizona burger and Big Pig are must tries, along with the Korean wings. Great service. Good prices. Delicious food."}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant  for the first time yesterday.  Went for breakfast  at 6.00 but they were not open  till 7.00. The operator  for wigwam told us the hours of operation.  For lunch  we had their  burgers . I tried to order the AZ burger but the waitress  insisted that we tried the burger with gouda cheese. I hated my burger because of the cheese. The burgers took 20 minutes  to be served  and we were starving.  The waitress  was  friendly  but I tried  three times  to order the order  the other burger.  The place was about 60 % filled"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try the Grill at the Wigwam today since neither of us had ever been. When we arrived the main room was closed to diners as it had a private meeting taking place so we were given a choice of a side room or the bar with a view of the golf course. We chose the side room and good choice as the bar had a small group loudly enjoying a golf game on the TV, which of course if fine since that is where one should enjoy such activity.   From what I understand this as were other areas of the resort recently remodeled. Like so many places that have been remodeled it seems they were playing it safe as not to offend, yet it does not excite. A nice republican staid feel to it.   We were greeted by a very pleasant man and seated directly. We were then greeted by the waitress who I think was Terri. She brought our drinks which was freshly brewed coffee. I had asked what brand and she said Starbucks, this surprised me as I liked that which she poured. She then explained it was a different blend from the blend they use in their stores.  My lunch partner and I both had a cup of clam chowder. the texture seemed more like a bisque but a very good flavour.  Mer had a pastrami sandwich and I the American Kobe burger. Both came with seasoned fries. My burger was quite good and much too big. So I now have dinner. Mer liked her pastrami and enjoyed every bite. We both liked the fries, yet I could only eat a few as they were just so full of flavour a few did the job.   Our wait person/Terri was very attentive and friendly through out and did as a wait person should, ask if we preferred dessert before she brought the check.   A very nice lunch was had."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  This is our second visit and the food quality has dropped tremendously. Thank goodness for our Groupon."}
{"text":"Played golf here again, but this time decided to get a bite afterword. Am I glad I did!    Just a little nosh, the crustini with the most delicious light seafood topping, and onion rings to DIE for, not frozen deep fried rings. Real sweet fresh onion in great batter fried to perfection. Worth the drive just for the onion rings!"}
{"text":"So today we played golf and decided to go have a bite at Reds. We had not been back in a while because of the menu. So we thought let's give a try. I find that everything we ordered was either fried or the chicken pepper sandwich was bone dry on tough bread . The chicken in squares with a piece of melted cheese and not hardly a bit of peppers. I ate it with a fork and left the bread. The sides (fries) were great the thick piece of half raw tuna on a bun was weird. We thought we were ordering a tuna fish sandwich because there are 2 ahi tunas apparently right next to each other. My bad I didn't think there was 2 of the same thing. I did not care for it. Sorry. I miss the old days at the golf club when they made healthy salads and fish tacos that were more fish with a light batter. They made a chicken pot pie that was a signature dish plus burgers, more delicious sandwiches that were not all fried and soaked in butter. I don't know what happened? But the Park cafe has seemed to take a lot of business because they are geared not only to be healthy but good. We love the wigwam like everyone else . But please give this 5 star resort 5 star menus . I feel bad writing this but this is talked about a lot.  Our server however was outstanding! We loved her I wish I could remember her name . Blonde lady. The boy who served our food the sweet man who greets you. All were so great."}
{"text":"Excellent food - tried the fried pickles, chips/dips and the Jesse burger.  Everything was delicious!  Go during happy hour though!   Nice variety of seating areas inside and out.  The waitress we had seemed impatient with us.  Our friends had gathered to catch up and chat and the waitress seemed pushy and arrogant."}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast/brunch today with a large group to celebrate a friend's graduation. The service was EXCELLENT and the food was quite tasty. We had a large party of 14 people and we were well cared for. The prices were very reasonable for a resort location and with the variety of dishes we ordered, everyone's meals were spot on. This is definitely a casual location meant for the golf/tennis crowd but it still has cloth napkins and proper china table wear. I was very impressed and look forward to a future visit!"}
{"text":"I just left Red's and had the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. We were seated at a table that still had crumbs on it, but decided to overlook it and order a drink and dinner.  I pointed out to the waiter that my drink had a hair in it as soon as he  brought it. He apologized and said that he would get that fixed right away. I decided that I had lost my appetite for a drink and went to stop him and the bartender from making another drink. I then saw the bartender pour the same exact drink into another glass and hand it to my waiter to re-serve to me.  I was flabbergasted. With such blatant disregard for hygiene, I wasn't about to have a meal here and left. Never again."}
{"text":"Love the food best yet the staff that's my spot a little get away from home bring the family watch some golf and games HD TVs"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Wigwam in August and decided to stop in for lunch at Red's since it was so convenient.  It is situated with great views of the golf course and has a lovely bar, indoor and outdoor space.  I thoroughly enjoyed my black bean burger (great recommendation by my server) with a side of fries.  My husband and I also shared a cup of the soup of the day (an orzo, chicken and vegetable soup...so ridiculously good!).  Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Great view, great service and good food. We had Eggs Benedict and Bacon and Eggs, which are both pretty easy to make. The side of country gravy was a little funky tasting, not sure why."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful waiter, Zach!  He was very attentive.  The food was good, but not outstanding for the price. The carpet at the entrance steps up to the restaurant was filthy.  It doesn't make a good impression.  It didn't get any better inside.  The carpet needs a good, deep clean cleaning or be replaced.  It is hard to get past the filthy carpet and think the place is clean.  The tile floor heading to the restrooms was quite dirty and there were broken tiles. When we arrived, there was no one at the front desk to greet us.  We stood there waiting for about 5 or 6 minutes.  This is not a good welcoming to guests."}
{"text":"I had the strawberry salad, delish!  My daughter had the sangria and it was definitely a generous pour!  Great for kids as well!  Beautiful golf course environment."}
{"text":"Nice setting & gorgeous view.  No problem with the service, as reported by some other posters, and prices were reasonable.  However, arriving at 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday, we were looking forward to the brunch buffet, but were told that they had just transitioned to lunch--no more buffet.  The lunch menu is limited, though the server pointed out that some breakfast items such as omelets and mimosas could still be ordered.  Although the setting is very nice, the place looks dingy--soiled carpet and a dead potted plant at the entrance steps.  If they would clean it up & extend the brunch hours, it would rate much higher--people who were just finishing the brunch buffet seemed very happy with what they were having."}
{"text":"Never have I ever had to wait in an outside restaurant with the waitress purposely ignoring out table to even be acknowledge then 30 minutes nor e for a cocktail the have the manager stop at the table to tell us the kitchen is really backed up....umm we ordered chips and salsa...yelp review but I will tell whoever I can!!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast and I would say that it was a pretty enjoyable dining experience. The wait staff was attentive and present and the food was great. Their outdoor seating area is extensive and the view of the golf course was beautiful. Their beer flights are also an excellent option with lots of selection."}
{"text":"A friend introduced us to Red's and we have easily become big fans of the outside patio when the temperature is right. I am crazy for good fish and chips. Getting the batter and cook time right seems to be difficult for most places I have been. They sure get it right here. I usually substitute regular fires for the sweet potato fries. I guess I have become a creature of habit because I find myself going to places based on the meal I am hungry for. This is the best Fish and chips I have found in Arizona. Keep the lights on for me. \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Red's Bar & Grill is located in Litchfield AZ and is in the Golf Course of the Wigwam Resort. This is a casual family friendly restaurant that offers Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. They have indoor seating with a bar and also offer patio seating that is dog friendly.  My review is only based on one visit were it happened to be restaurant week.  The parking lot was full but we were able to find a spot on the street not too far away.  We entered the restaurant and one person was in front of us. He said he is with a group of EIGHTY PEOPLE. When the hostess gets to us she says the restaurant is full so we have to sit on the patio. It happened to be very hot today so I said that would be ok but only if I could be sat in the shade. She found a shaded table and it wasn't too bad.  We were greeted by a perky friendly server. She took our order and things got going.  We started with the Greek Salad off the Restaurant Week Menu. It wasn't what I was expecting but it really was good. Chunks of fresh cool watermelon with a little cucumber, onion and olives in a tasty dressing. What's not to like?  Then we get our Sandwich Platters.  I got the Fish Po Boy. I received a Tempura Battered Piece of mild white fish. The sandwich was filled with tomatoes, crisp citrus slaw and topped with a remoulade dressing. All the components of the sandwich were GOOD especially the Delicious Tasty Hoagie Roll....(I'm now sorry I didn't ask if they made it or where they purchased it from).......The problem was that the roll was so big it was impossible to eat this sandwich as a sandwich. It's also way too much bread to eat a battered protein. I think someone in management should try to eat this sandwich so they can know first hand what I mean. I had to eat the fish with a knife and fork. I think this sandwich would be far more successful as in some sort of open wrap or soft taco. The Fries were also very good. They seemed like they were hand cut and were a generous portion. The fries also stayed piping hot.  My husband had the Cobb Burger. It looked beautiful..But my husband said the meat patty was dry and lacked juice. We don't know if the juice got squished out from cooking or if the meat was just packed too tight.   Both desserts were very good. We both had Ice Cream Sandwiches. They also were very generous in size. They were both made with detailed fresh baked cookies that contained chips and drizzle and both had a THICK Milk Chocolate Ice Cream Center.   Service was friendly and efficient. Our server even offered refills without us asking for them.  I did have to struggle with the rating here. With just a small amount of tweaking this certainly would be FOUR Stars to me.   I think the Yelp Average is accurate here......3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Service was so slow, I say non existent. Once someone finally came by our table, she was really nice. Just never saw her again. Drink refills were missing too unless asked. Food was bar food- average.  The environment wasn't bad, for basically a 19th hole place."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of being a starter for the McKenzie Canadian Golf Tour this week at the Wigwam Golf Course. Met some great people, saw some outstanding golf and overall was very impressed with the players on this professional golf tour. I also got to have several lunches at Reds. I was equally impressed with the food and the service at Reds. The atmosphere is very \"country clubish\" loads of golfers celebrating after their round with friends. Well, not all celebrating, some of them crying in their beer.  But, it was clear that the drinks were flowing, the food was being devoured and the volume was spirited. There is a large outdoor area, so you have you choice of the bar area, a more removed area (for small to medium groups), general restaurant area and the outdoor patio area. So, take your pick.  I ordered the Chinese Chicken Wrap with sweet potato fries. It was very good, all the right tastes wrapped up nicely. The next day I had the Arizona burger. A giant burger with guacamole, peppers, caramelized onions, cheese and few other things. Honestly, it was one of the first burgers I could not get my mouth around, I had to take it apart and eat the parts separately.  Not that this was in any way bad, it was just a giant burger with so much on it that for me it was impossible to hold and eat. The menu is not large, which is good, but from what I had and from what I could see the other patrons wolfing down, the menu seems solidly excellent.  Also, the service was top notch."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Wigwam and Reds Bar and Grill is on property. Litchfield's was closed since it was a Sunday so we decided to walk to Reds. It was not busy but they had a small party on the patio. We were seated and while we saw 4-6 waiters walk by, no one stopped at or table. No water or drinks, not even the typical \"I will be right with you\". After 13 minutes, a waiter came up and said he'd be right with us. 5 minutes later, he came back and we asked how long it would take to get food. He said the kitchen was about an hour behind and we couldn't even get an appetizer sooner then 45 min. Asked the same about mixed drinks and apparently there was a 20 min wait for the bar... At that point, we just decided to walk out. We didn't even get to try the food so I can't comment on that but if a restaurant can't handle a small party and other guests, it's not a place I would visit again. I highly recommend the Wigwam Bar over Reds Bar and Grill. I suggest you avoid Reds.."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, beautiful view of the greens !!Great patio! Fun for a lunch outing or causal dinner!! Great margaritas !"}
{"text":"Really nicely decorated, and a very relaxing environment. Drinks are pretty pricey. Great if you want a quiet place to meet up with someone, but if you are looking to have a few drinks, anywhere else in the area would be considerably cheaper."}
{"text":"I like the food - the drinks not so much. In nice weather sit outside for a nice view."}
{"text":"Great Ambiance and service, food is good. Wish we would have had the hamburgers, they looked amazing. I had the Chicago dog and it was very good. The fish was not as good and when we said something to the waiter he had the manager come over who comped the food. Historic and a great addition to Litchfield Park"}
{"text":"My burger was really good, I had the BBQ burger, regular fries. Everything was hot and fresh. I thought getting my food took a bit longer then it should have I thought. They weren't that busy at the time. Servers were great, kept my drink full with out asking, believe it or not."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying always ask for Sam! Our waiter Sam absolutely blew myself and my fianc√© away, the food was great and the service was even better. Our food came out fast and was perfectly done, if I could give this place a 6 I would!"}
{"text":"Went from having a great experience at another restaurant at the Wigwam for breakfast to having this not so great experience for dinner. I thought at a hotel all restaurants would be held to the same standard but it seems that might not be the case. I hate giving bad reviews, I very rarely give them! But my family's experience here was definitely sub par. We ordered pretzel bites to start. The pretzel bites were never brought to us, at all. Our server never really checked on us. Took a really long time of us to get our food. My mom has celiacs and made sure she emphasized that she wanted her burger just on lettuce and can't have the bun. I got the black bean burger. When we were served, our server said that he thought we had already gotten out pretzel bites, we said no but it was ok and to just cancel the order. I hate to say it but I think this was the worst veggie burger I've ever had. I don't think they cooked it at all. Sometimes black bean burgers are kinda mushy and that's no problem. But the exterior is at least a little crisp. This was so salty and mushy I couldn't even eat it. I just ate the bun and my side of fruit. Which included watermelon that still had the black seeds in it. Spitting out seeds isn't my favorite thing to do during a nice dinner haha. My moms burger came on a bun even though she said no bun. So they took it back, removed the bun, and gave it back. Like that's cross contamination with gluten! Also my sister had a wedge salad which made her feel quite sick for some reason. Oh yeah and there was a hair in her wedge salad. They did give us 15% off for forgetting the pretzels which was nice. But otherwise not the best time here.."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch. Restaurant was packed. Waited a while for service. No cappuccino machine. Our server made the difference. Sam you are wonderful!"}
{"text":"There were some great things about our visit to Red's, and some less than okay things about it. Let's start with the good first...  The scenery is amazing, especially if your seated outside next to the golf course (which we weren't - reservations are must apparently). The inside is nice too, and provides a play area for the kids (although the video games in it do not function). The food was also very good. I ordered a large burger with bleu cheese and bacon on it and was impressed. Now for the bad...  It was my birthday. Before we came, we made sure to call in and ask if it would be okay to bring cake and pie for after our dinner. We were told that this would not be a problem at all, so we brought the cake and pie. Upon entering, we were told that we could not bring those items in, so the pie was left in the car. The cake, being shaped with whipped cream and strawberries, could not be left out in a hot car, so we opted to throw it into a bag and keep it out of sight. We asked again, just to get some clarity, about eating the cake after dinner to which one staff member said that they absolutely cannot allow for us to do that. Then, another staff member informed us that they could, but there would be a \"plating fee\" of $2 a slice on a cake we'd already purchased elsewhere. So with these varying responses, we decided to avoid the silliness and just eat dessert at a nearby park instead. Inconvenient? Yes. Left a mark on an otherwise good experience? You bet."}
{"text":"Great food here at Reds as well as a fun atmosphere.   I highly recommend the fish.  Best fish and chips I have ever had.  Lightly breaded with tempura.  More fish than breaking.   My son loves the BBQ beef burger.  Bring your putters as there is a putting green adjacent the patio seating.   Great place and lots of fun.  Ashlee was a great waitress and a lot of fun to be around tonight.  If you can sit in her section you will enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Service was horrible.  Hence the 2 stars.   Not even half full restaurant & 2 hrs from start to finish"}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation for a party of seven. We are Goodyear residents and have been for 17 years so we are very familiar with the Wigwam. Maybe that's why I was so disappointed in our entire experience. The front end staff was goofing around with each other as our party of 7 stood there with no one greeting us. They knew we were coming and the restaurant wasn't remotely busy. Right off the bat, I was thinking that this isn't what I expect from this resort's reputation. We asked for some chips and salsa and they brought out stale chips with, no kidding, Pace picante sauce! The food is marginal and over priced. The staff while friendly is very young and unprofessional. I'm giving it 2 stars because the atmosphere has potential, and our server was attentive. With all the choices we now have in the west valley, I would not go back."}
{"text":"I really wish we could have better service at this place. It's like they hire high schoolers right off the street to be waiters. While the burgers are good, it kinda ruins the mood when you have to ask for everything and the meal takes over 45 min to arrive. Also, it's a bit pricey for what you get.  ***update... 1 month later, went for dinner, we all had burger and 3 of us even had the same burger order. Food took over an hour and the burgers were cold and the fries old. My mom and dad sent them back, and got a good burger. The place only had a few tables full, so not sure why there were issues with the food. Waiter was good this time. But it Put a damper on our Father's Day."}
{"text":"Came to try this place after getting a Groupon.  The menu had so many yummy options.  I ended up ordering the Turkey & Apple- turkey patty, green apple slaw, parsley, pickled red onion, caramelized apple spread.  Yet I got a stale, dried turkey patty, dried old bread, there was no taste to the pickled onions and i wish it had some spread, it would have have helped the dry taste.  My sandwich came with cold, stale french fries to boot.  Ok, this one is scratched off the list!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could have given this place 3 1/2 stars because I feel 3 is a little harsh, but I just can't do 4.  In the end I'm paying for a meal and the food has to meet the mark.   Nestled into the huge campus of the Wigwam Resort, this place inside is cool indeed.  The layout inside is conducive to small groups hanging out and having a few drinks.  The bar and patio were substantial.  The view from the patio is great as it is right off the golf course.    My party and I went for breakfast and sat outside.  We were passed by several servers for about 5 to 10 minutes before one of them approached us and decided to be our server. (Maybe we looked like bad tippers?)  They had a breakfast buffet which looked good but didn't seem worth it to me for the $15 price tag.  I ordered the monte cristo sandwich.  It came open faced which was interesting.  The turkey was dry and the cheese was bland.  I must admit, I prefer the monte cristo battered and deep fried with the raspberry preserves and powdered sugar. (Like at Disneyland!)    I was turned off when they scoffed at an order for a simple ham and cheese omelet from a child in our party.  They suggested we pay for a child's buffet and order one at the omelet bar.  It was undercooked.  The menu was limited and they didn't entertain any type of variations/substitutions to the items listed.    We all know this type of place.  They rely heavily on the view, location and the resort business to carry them along.  The prices are high and the food mediocre at best.  I would rather spend my money at a dive and receive awesome food I can't get anywhere else.    I guess I just convinced myself....they deserve the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Definitely not nearly the caliber of their sibling, the Red Door Spa. I know this place is intended to be more of a casual pub for the resort golfers, locals, spa patrons and others who want an inexpensive lunch, but they could do better. This is the third time I've eaten here and I have no complaints about their food, (other than the cook can NEVER get what 'well done' for a hamburger means) nothing has a wow factor either.  I always loved the pubs growing up that had a casual signature food that was soo dang good, you could only get it there.  Red's won't disappoint, but don't expect to fall in love either! Atmosphere outdated. My husband dismissed it because the resort has been around for a long time.  Yes, but seriously, time to refurbish a little.  Make it a little more \"golf-modern.\" My favorite example would be the clubhouse restaurant of Verrado.  The Verrado Grille.  Comparable, as it's for day golfers, the locals, and general public as well, but it's a few notches above Red's.  The booth seating is awkward; tables just a little too high (or booth seats too low) and the furniture is outdated.  Howard Johnson's anyone? Please, consider a make-over Red's.  For now I'll continue taking my out of towners to Verrado Grille, even though you're just minutes away."}
{"text":"Wow! This was my second try here and I am hooked! We sat out on the patio at a hightop and enjoyed the beautiful golf course. Kelsey was a wonderful server plus she complimented my dress so nice. Most servers just want to take your order and be done with you. I am thrilled that Reds has a vegetarian option! The amazingly giant and delicious BlackBean burger. I cant wait to come back to Reds and enjoy the food and ambiance again very soon!"}
{"text":"Was staying at the Wigwam Resort this weekend and decided to have brunch at Reds Sunday morning.  We approached the hostess stand with a couple of people ahead of us.  One gentlemen was quite frustrated with the hostess as he had been patiently waiting for a table.   The restaurant was about 20 percent occupied, with empty tables throughout the interior.  The outside patio seating, which was quite popular was approx 50 percent occupied. The other 50 percent of the tables had dirty dishes on them.   Of course with an elderly couple joining my wife and I, we expressed the desire for a table in the shade outside.  We waited patiently as no one made any attempt the bus the tables. Eventually we agreed to a table in the sun when it was quite apparent there was no management oversight, and if there was, it was not evident or there was little care for the customers.  Should have known this from the start based on the frustrated gentlemen noted above.  We watched as two bus boys began clearing dishes off tables.  The only thing is the did not finished. The took the plates off 5 or 6 shady tables but left the dirty glasses and silverware......and never came back!  The tables remained dirty as customers, looking at the shady spots, were seated in the sun or went inside.   We ate are entire meal, which by the way was pretty good, at a dirty table we moved to because of the lack of service.   The waitress we had was nice and did a good job!  I was a little disappointed when she cleaned off my dirty coffee cup saucer on her pants leg!!  Another sign of poor management! This place could really be good if staff had some clue and supervision on how to run a food service operation.  But that would assume the wanted to....."}
{"text":"This place is big and has several entrances.  It was good for a large group hang out and a small play area for kids!  There is a patio area too, but too HOT to sit outside right now.  The service was very slow but the server was nice.  I don't know if they are lack of servers or just slow in service.  My party were already seated and I did not see them.  LOL!  But thanks to modern technology - the cell phone I can text them.  :)  Found out their were sitting in the back area and if I would have worn my glasses I would have spotted them.  Getting old!!!  I got The Jesse (bacon cheeseburger).  It was ok.  I am not sure if I tasted red's sauce or not.  The french fries were good.  The food delivery was very slow too.  Maybe it was an off night or something.  I would be back to try this place again."}
{"text":"Disappointing management- (young man dark hair) not accommodating our party that we had Reserved two months in advance. Wait staff is friendly enough.  Drinks are over-priced ($54 for 5 shots) and weird Tater-tots in the salad that the menu called garlic croutons, wrong sandwiches brought to the table but no one ever came back to check on us. Empty drinks and kept cold empty appetizer platters on the table the whole time. Our bill was over $400, but we didn't get treated very well."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! We stopped here for breakfast while visiting family and Kelsey was simply a delightful host.  I'm always expecting to be stuck eating salads at a \"burger joint\" but to my surprise, ?Kelsey had more options for me. We had the fried pickles  (my family) and red wings  (yay!) and both were fantastic.  The wings were moist and flavorful and enough to share.  Bottomline: great place for family, friends to gather for good food.  There is a lot of space so you don't feel crowded when you are in large groups.  Great for kids (they have good food options for them) too."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere on the patio. The staff is friendly and the food is consistently good. A nice bar and grill with lots of nice green grass"}
{"text":"There are apparently two places. This had a prime rib special on Saturdays for $29. Had waiter named Sam and he was great  Food was just ho hum. Looked at the owners associations minutes that were posted outside.  I noted that the restaurant is due for a major renovation.   It certainly needs it.  If they do not do something with it soon, it is just going to shrivel up and die.  Outdoor dining available. Basically this place is a salad sandwich with a few main courses. Carrot were blanched in sugar water and weren't done very hard and crunchy.  type of restaurant.  Spaghetti was not good (mushy). The prime rib needed a sharp steak knife to cut it."}
{"text":"First, our server Ashlee was awesome from beginning to end!  We always appreciate a server who gives you the appropriate attention not just when they drop off the check!   Our party of four left happy and full!   Burgers were all great and the fish tacos were average.  Beer and wine were good. Nice to have a local place to come and enjoy dinner with friends. We live close by and will be back.  Only recommendation would be to expand the menu a bit."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with our kids, expecting to meet another couple from out of town.  Four of us met in the bar for happy hour drinks, waiting for the other two!!  Great service in the bar!!  We moved outdoors at 5 pm when the other couple was supposed to meet us.  It soon became 5:25pm, and they still hasn't arrived!  Hunter, our waiter, kept checking on us about every 5 minutes... He was AWESOME!  More on him later!!  Turns out the other couple mistook the date we were supposed to meet.... They're in Hawaii tonight!!  Hunter took our order and we all ordered burgers with no buns!  After the last off our orders with no buns, he asked, \"is something wrong with our buns?\"  I said, \"not really, your buns are just too big..... Uh, not yours personally, just the ones you serve here !!\"  After that, Hunter was very at ease with our group...  But... What really bothered us was the way the manager treated Hunter.  She came to our table several times, asking how we were being treated.... Every time, we said were VERY happy with the service.  We got the distinct impression she was looking for dirt on Hunter, and we didn't like that, AT ALL!!  Check comes the table and its for $82 and some change... We all realize that's a little short on what it should be.  Then we realize that the bartender didn't add our bar tab (while seated inside).  We tell Hunter about the issue and he tries to talk to the aforementioned bitch of a manager, and she openly shrugged him off...  She finally decided to meet with him to discuss our bill, and discovers that a group of diners liked their waiter SO MUCH, they didn't want him to get in trouble, that they ended up with a bill for over $120.  That manager needs to be fired, in our collective opinion!!"}
{"text":"Red's is a great local place in downtown Litchfield Park. Their menu is not expansive, but the food is great. They also have a nice selection of beer and the view is fantastic."}
{"text":"I love this spot. Great selection of seating, food, alcohol. Helpful staff, and a quality food for the money! I look forward to the live music schedule, too!"}
{"text":"They came highly recommended by the folks at the spa so we decided we would check it out. The atmosphere was very relaxed, very pub, sports bar. they had a lot of TV's with games on, groups of people sitting around at the couch seating - which they had a lot of - as well as regular and bar height tables. They even had outdoor seating!  We were seated right away. One of their appetizer specials caught my attention immediately - the gorgonzola artichoke dip. It was very tasty, but the only complaint which I- and my fellow dinner partners - had was that the serving of the dip was too small!!! Which it really was, especially considering the amount of chips that came with it!   But that ladies and gents, was where all the positives ended.  My friend ordered a side of blue cheese dressing with her wings.. despite having reminded our server, it didn't come, until we asked someone else! We all ordered some type of burger/sandwich each for our entr√©es. I asked for a side of blue cheese, and if the onions for my turkey burger could be caramelized. She said they could do that. Y'all, I really dislike raw red onions. Anyway... our food took FOREVER! We waited so long they brought us another bowl of chips, and some salsa. One would think they had to hunt the animals and hand grind the meat for the patties!! I got full on wings and tortilla chips!  When our food finally came, it looked like a small child had bitten into the side of the buns. These buns were STALE!! My friend went to hold hers and it basically disintegrated in her hands. My sandwich looked so boring, it didn't even tempt me to take a bite... and there was no side of blue cheese in sight and the onions had been literally thrown on the grill, not caramelized! So yes, still pretty raw. To add insult to injury, the server split the checks wrong (she only had to do it 2 ways). And THEN would you believe that for another hour, NOT ONE person asked us if we wanted anything else, didn't even offer us water. Even though we continued to sit there talking with ALL of our dishes in front of us! That's right! They didn't even clear our plates! I know I won't ever be going back there!"}
{"text":"Loved this place .  Here for spring training and this spot is beautiful and the food and service is excellent.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Our server, June, was so wonderful and so was the food. This is one of our favorite places for lunch and happy hour!"}
{"text":"The patio is beautiful and definitely a nice serene place to enjoy some drinks and good food. The chicken nachos were delicious, definitely a large serving and they had it layered which is always a plus in my book. We a few of their signature cocktails as well, the one with the hibiscus flower was my favorite. Definitely a nice strong pour. The service was phenomenal and all of the staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here last night. It's a pretty casual place and the food is very good. One less start for the limited selection in entr√©es. My wife had a salad that seemed to never end and I had a shrimp po boy.   Our waiter and the rest of the staff were excellent! Service was super quick.   The interior is a little dated and our nice waiter informed us they are remodeling very soon.   It's close to home and not a chain so we will come back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Red's Bar and Grill and we did not enjoy our food. The regular soft drinks did not taste right, either. Our service was slow and it seems this restaurant is dying."}
{"text":"We made reservations for Mother's Day well in advance. We arrived on time to find there was no specifically reserved table for us and we were shown to an outside table that was in full sun. When asked for another table we were given a booth that had seen better days. The food was OK but I expected more from a 4 star resort. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My party of four had reservations for noon on Saturday.  We were seated promptly and asked for our drink orders.  One of our party ordered a soft drink, coffee and water.  She was never brought the water she ordered.  When our drinks arrived, all of our drink glasses were very spotted.  The timing between appetizer and our meals was fine.  Our food (fried pickles and burgers) was very good.  Service on the other hand was very slow, especially taking into consideration that the restaurant was not busy.  Our glasses went empty for long periods and we had to ask for refills.  We had to ask for the table to be cleared after the appetizers and the meal.  Check was brought before we were asked if we'd like dessert.  We did order dessert, but the apple cobbler tart was brought to the table cold and without the whipped cream.  All in all, I was very disappointed in our visit.  Definitely not the experience I would have expected, with it being a Wigwam restaurant."}
{"text":"Before and after golf, we ate breakfast. Had the three eggs omelet with ham, mushrooms and Monterey cheese. No hash browns, but there roasted potatoes were pretty good. Jojo our server was cordial and accommodating. Gave us a full container of coffee to take with us. After the tournament we came in for lunch and 3 of us ordered the Jesse Burger nothing special just a hamburger with cheese and bacon, lettuce and tomato with French fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and the fries were hot, temperature wise. So, if you happen to be in the neighborhood, this is a must stop. Burger cost $12. Omelette for breakfast was $10."}
{"text":"We live 5 mins from here and I wasn't sure if it was more of a bar or more of a grill, so I was hesitant to bring my kids here.  But we took a chance on a quiet Sunday afternoon.  We opted to sit on the patio since it was only 100 degrees  it was shady with misters and empty...so very peaceful!   Our meal was really good.  A variety of burgers and fries along with a few beers.  Very, very tasty food.  So food, location and ambiance were a win in my book.  The only rough part was the service was not the best, this is why I have docked a star.  It wasn't horrible.  Everyone was friendly.  But they could have been more attentive.  I had to ask for water, and it was quite awhile before we got our check.  But otherwise, it was a good experience.  Again, the service is a minor complaint.  But to get 5 stars from me I like the whole experience to be top notch.  Needless to say, we will return.  With our family in tow or perhaps even a date night."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! The food was amazing ! The nachos were really good ! I had the fish tacos were tasty. I would definitely return. I came here using a groupon coupon it was wel worth the deal even without the coupon"}
{"text":"For someone who suffers with severe anaphylactic allergies this was a safe and amazing experience.  While they don't offer an official allergy/gluten free menu they will make any accommodation that is necessary.  The food/beverage manager Brooke was the kindest person who went out of her way to make sure I had an enjoyable and safe experience.  She is extremely knowledgeable and gave me her personal cell phone to make sure the rest of our weekend was the same at all of the Wigwam restaurants.  They do have gluten free buns and are happy to do whatever you need.  Chef Anthony made sure I had a great safe burger."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a wonderful job with the remodel!  This place is great!  The new management under Mr. George McGann has really turned this place around.  It is a great place to relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery.  We love all the new televisions that they have installed!!  Great job Wigwam!  Don't miss out on the Jessie burger! Yum!"}
{"text":"I have given this place too many chances. Great location, good service yet always disappointing food. If they would put more effort into the menu, purchase higher quality ingredients and employ an experienced chef, this place would flourish.  I wish them the best."}
{"text":"What a dinner!  Wife and I took advantage of a summer special at the Wigwam and took advantage of a restaurant.com coupon for the Grill at the Wigwam.  Couldn't have been nicer.  The service at The Grill is impeccable.  The restaurant itself is very comfortable and provides a nice view of the golf courses.  But on to the food.  I had the New York Strip steak medium rare.  It was outstanding.  Nearly fork tender and super grilled taste.  Don't know the sauce it was served with but it made a great steak taste even better.  My lovely wife had the pork chop and it was superb.  She really liked the sauce it was served with.    The house salad is plentiful and fresh.  Every ingredient was fresh, crispy and the house dressing was excellent.    All in all, we had a dinner fit for an early summer eve's finest."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I actually bought this on Groupon and was hesitant since it was on there but I really enjoyed my food and my drink and the atmosphere. I had the wings & a Caesar salad. Both tasted it great. The service was fast and the waiter was very polite. It's a beautiful area over by the Wigwam. I would recommend you try it for yourself. Overall, I would go back."}
{"text":"Best buffet on Sunday mornings!  We went before church, it was great!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night 700- got a table right away outside . Nice ambiance outside by the golf course. Never was filled the time we were there. Took about 35 minutes to get our food once we ordered which we thought was odd as they were not that busy. The hamburger one of our party had was large and tasty. The chicken enchilada was good also . The pork sliders were another matter they were served on a bisquick roll and fell apart when the person in our party bit into it. The bbq sauce was non existent on the meat but the pork  was tender . The crab costiini for $14 should have been put on the appetizer menu for half of what they charged ,as the plain tasting crab was spread thinly on a roll that was about 5 inches by 3 inches  as my meal was finished in 2 minutes while I waited for everyone else to finish. I will return for the $12 hamburger and fries"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant while my dad was staying in town. The experience was excellent, despite the construction going on inside. The grounds were beautifully landscaped and once we arrived the view of the golf course was a surprisingly wonderful view (I'm not even a golfer); The weather was remarkable. The waiter was friendly, prompt, and pleasant. He recommended the Chef's Turkey Ruben. I appreciated his confidence in suggesting the order, as all too often waiters/waitresses seem wary of suggesting the wrong order and give the usual \"it depends on what you're in the mood for\". He gave me two recommendations and said that this was his favorite. He was quite confident I would love it and I did! This dish is definitely for people who love flavor and despite being told it was tasty, it exceeded my expectations nonetheless. I live in the Phoenix metropolitan area and would come back just for this sandwich."}
{"text":"I had a reservation for 8pm on a Friday night.  It was perfect.  The place was EMPTY so I had my choice of seating.  I picked a nice, dimly lit golf course view.    My girlfriend ordered the shrimp pesto and I ordered the fish and chips Friday special.  We also spent the big $2 on a cup of clam chowder, which was excellent.  Overall the meal was quite delicious.  Tip of the day - these guys are on restaurant.com!  Save some $$$!!!  Our total bill including 2 entrees and a desert was about $40.  We used our restaurant.com coupon which bought it down to like $22 out of pocket including gratuity!"}
{"text":"The menu has a good variety of foods and everything is delicious. My favorite app is the fish tacos which I order for dinner & it's plenty of food for one. The Pok√© tostadas are a fave of my son & husband. Great outdoor dining on the golf course."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Called ahead and was told their patios was dog friendly. I bring my well behaved dogs to what is a TOTALLY EMPTY patio. As in NO ONE ELSE THERE. We sit and order a glass of wine and burgers.  When the burgers are delivered, our waiter informs us that the patio is not dog friendly and while we can stay and eat, don't bring the dogs back. The waiter then comes out 4 more times to apologize. Then the bus boy apologizes.   Turns out the person who made the call is \"Chef Jason\" who was more concerned about my dogs on his empty patio than cooking my food the way I ordered it. Both burgers were overcooked and tasteless. Buns were cold. Fries tasted like the bottom of the oil vat. Chef Jason would be fired from In and Out since he can't seem to cook a basic burger.  To make the visit all the more special, my waiter begged me to not \"take the dog thing out on him\" - meaning I shouldn't tip him badly. Seriously? I gave him 15% but that's because he was a below average server. He was slow. Didn't remember two requests for a glass of water. Couldn't remember to turn the TV to the football game and didn't even ensure we had tableware. Had to beg a bus boy for that.  I was there during happy hour. Don't waste the stop. $1 off beer/wine and $1 off a select group of appetizers.  If you want to watch sports, you'll need to do it inside. Their patio only has one TV.  They have four so-so beers on tap. The selection is almost minimal and boring now that even chain restaurants are getting more mirco brews. In fact the Chevron station at Litchfield and McDowell has better beers at their growler station. A gas station beats this upscale bar.  Consider I was here on a Saturday afternoon during an NFL playoff game - the barrenness of the patio should speak volumes on the restaurant.  For local folks who support these places after the tourists melt, I'd appreciate more respect. If my dogs were causing a problem, I could see asking them to leave. But two well behaved dogs on an empty patio ... What a jerk, chef jason. Go back to Denny's where your sub-standard culinary skills blend in."}
{"text":"Seriously? 40+ min wait time for the patio and there are 6 people sitting outside.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"After a long day I didn't feel like driving somewhere to get a quick bite so I stopped at reds before heading to my room. I ordered the hummus which came quickly. It was warm with pita bread that was perfectly baked. I love hummus and this did not disappoint. I also ordered the pork sliders which comes with pickled cabbage on a Hawaiian roll. The flavors were on point! For coming in for a quick bite I was impressed. The service was excellent. I also got to meet the manager Tim, who really cared about my experience at the restaurant. I would definitely recommend Reds.   They also have outside seating with tables that have propane fire in the middle so be sure to ask for a smores kit for only 5$ my kids had a blast! So did I"}
{"text":"Got there at 3pm. Food was average the fruit looked like it had been out for 3 or 4 days not sure why someone would ever serve it. Lots of tweens work there. This place was so much better before all the turnover. We were the only ones there and I couldn't get a refill on my drink once. Sat for over an hour. Employees just hang out and do nothing all day.  Plus the soda is disgusting. They haven't cleaned it in who knows how long. My friend who has taken me here is a member of the resort. Truly sad how bad thing place is now."}
{"text":"Within the last year, this place has gone through a great transformation.  The former bar and separate restaurant spaces have been combined into a much improved open area. The outdoor seating area is great when the weather permits.  The bar offers a nice selection of beers, including rotating seasonal taps. This summer, we received a few 1 cent beer flight vouchers, which is unbeatable.  A few large screen TV's are spread around the dining area with a collection of smaller TV's behind the bar, all showing sports programming. There is also a small play area within site of the dining room with two video game consoles for the kiddies.  The food is upscale bar food, with a nice selection of burgers, sandwiches, salads, and appetizers. All of the burgers are great and the onion rings with a side of house made spicy ketchup are awesome. Try the Arizona burger or the BBQ beef burger, if you have an appetite.  Finally, the service is always top notch.  One other thing: Keep an eye out for Groupon deals."}
{"text":"Stayed at The Wigwam & went here for dinner. Nice place, very casual.  Our waiter was very friendly & was helpful with the menu items.  My wife & I split a cheeseburger w/ fries & a side of onion rings.  The food was fantastic.  For a golf course clubhouse restaurant, it is way above average.  Respectable drink menu, as well.  Good mix of cocktails & beer.  You will find something you like."}
{"text":"I have been to this place when it was Red Allen's Steak House and reviewed it under that name. However, it has undergone a drastic renovation from its previous iteration. They have done a phenomenal job.   Gone is the subdued carpet, black and white clad wait staff and claustrophobic bar. They removed the wall separating the dining room from the bar area, essentially created one large open space. The floor is now done in a wood motif and the staff is wearing cute (if maybe a tad on the nose) Pendleton shirts with jeans. Now there are lots of TVs to relax and enjoy, but it isn't the loud sort of atmosphere your find at BWW, just a smidge more mature and refined than that. There is an accordion door that leads out onto the patio which overlooks a putting green and has views of the 18th green.  The menu for lunch/dinner has also undergone a massive change. The Redwings are seriously delicious and the Bacon-IPA cheese dip is a hit. They also offer Korean Crispy wings which looked super yummy, though we didn't try them last week when we went, we may well try that tonight. There is also now a decent selection of local (San Tan and Four Peaks) draught brews as well as some smart major brewery choices. Other Items range from burgers and fish tacos to steak frites.   The only \"negative\" comments and the reason for the lack of the star is two fold. The chicken drummettes came out the first time, ever so slightly under cooked. Since this is chicken, it matters. When they came out again, the fat ones were just over the threshold to be eaten, thank goodness. The flat portions were fine, which explains the problem. Pieces of chicken which are that different in size (the drummettes are generous) can't be cooked for the same amount of time. I was told they double fry these, which is awesome, but they need to cook the drums separately on the first go and add a couple of minutes to their cooking time. They can then be combined and fried the second time together. (Not like they are going to read this, but my .02 anyway). The second \"issue\" if you will was just an inexperienced wait staff. This is understandable given the new format.  In short, a long overdue local bar and grill with a good selection of freshly made, quality foods, paired with tasty beers and cocktails. Headed there again this afternoon for happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Wife ordered salad wedge. Supposed to come with avocado and citrus vinaigrette. No avocado, but avocado sauce. Waitress says another dollar or two for avocado. She should look at menu. Also she got ranch dressing, no vinaigrette. My burger was luke warm. Beer was good. No salt and pepper shakers and no cushions on chairs. Not coming back. Was one of my favorite places"}
{"text":"Such an amazing lunch ! The food is great the restaurant is beautiful, (with an atmosphere you don't get just anywhere in Phoenix )and the food is to die for ! The last thing that makes this bar & grill so amazing is the service that the staff provides ! Thank you Red's - my fianc√© and I can't wait to return !"}
{"text":"The food at this Wigwam golf course is great. The fruit was so fresh and I got the turkey burger on lettuce bun, they were great to accommodate our diet. If you sit outside, the birds are always cawing at you and at your table. Recommend you sit inside."}
{"text":"Great ambiance on a Friday HH.. our first time there.. fish tacos were great if u like breaded and pork sliders with fries were great. I think we will try the burgers next time.. they looked amazing at the next table! We would definitely go again. We love  to play golf together so will definitely be back to eat and have some drinks after 18 holes."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious lunch at our favorite West Valley resort.  The Asian Wrap is the perfect summer light meal that is fresh and tasty.  Jessica made the lunch experience even better with her attentive, friendly service!  This is the place to go on hot summer days to cool off, watch golfers practice their putting skills, take in a variety of sports in their many TVs, and relax for a leisurely meal."}
{"text":"Their much needed remodel is done .. That place was a bad 60s throwback before.  Had lunch outside .. Patio, gorgeous.  Food, very good.  Their new lunch menu is interesting. Our service was good but I did see the manager called to a couple tables around us.  Just sayin'. With the remodel, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Now called \"Red Allen's\" for the original golf pro.  This establishment remains a great piece of a great resort now call simply \"The Wigwam\". Traditions do live on."}
{"text":"This place is clean with quick service. Staff is very friendly. However so glad we had a Groupon. The fried pickles are amazing. We got the chicken and peppers sandwich with fries  and the Tuna Poke Tostadas. The sandwich was very bland considering all the amazing ingredients on it. Had zero flavor I ended up putting ranch on it just to eat some of it. The fries where cold and tasted stale. The Tuna was left very large and had no ginger/ sesame oil flavor what so ever. Our waitress Rihanna was amazing and knowledgeable and wanted to make us happy. She also addressed this with the manager Brook who came directly to our table and worked hard to make us happy.  She brought us out 2 amazing burgers. The Jesse and the IPA burger. Both where busting with flavor and she also gave us the history behind them as well. The fries where super hot and fresh and had a great buttery salted taste. Yummy. Sometimes your first impression can be wrong and you should let them have a second chance. Everyone has off days! We will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the pretzel and cheese appetizer. It arrived about a minute prior to our meal. Cheese sauce was the consistency of water. It was terrible. Service was no better. Cheeseburger was decent. Not good enough to go back."}
{"text":"Fish and chips were ok. Not much flavor. The side of Cesar salad was topped with tater tots-  I had the ahi tuna salad. It was ok, not my favorite.  Ice cream sandwich dessert was delicious. We had one chocolate chip and one chocolate cherry. Atmosphere is fun and upbeat, but I was disappointed with the lack of healthy options on the menu"}
