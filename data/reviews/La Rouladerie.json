{"text":"We had the privilege to have our ceremony canapés and wedding desserts from la rouladrie. What a great pleasure to work with this team. Jila the owner did an amazing job in addressing all our needs and delivering high quality, perfectly decorated and amazingly delicious food for our big day. She listened to all our ideas and implemented them one by one. Keep them in mind whenever you need an impeccable catering service and try their amazing brunches in their little European terrace on Bernard street."}
{"text":"This is if not the best one of the best brunch I have ever had in Montreal, the staff are pretty nice and welcoming. The quality of food and option you have are good. You can try Persian breakfast with high quality there. The bread and jam are wonderful there. Also you should try tea with their different herbs there, it's incredible."}
{"text":"chic and cozy restaurant in a beautiful lovely cartier. Friendly waitresses and manager. Delicious food and perfect service :) Highly recommended, you'll never regret..."}
{"text":"Je suis entrée dans ce beau petit resto avec un certain niveau d'attentes étant donné les cinq étoiles sur Yelp. Malheureusement, j'ai été déçue...

Je suis allée pour le lunch et j'ai pris la soupe du jour aux lentilles et à la grenade (trop salée) que j'ai accompagnée d'une salade de betteraves et feta (trop vinaigrée). Côté portions, seule la soupe ou la salade aurait été suffisante. Mes collègues ont pris une assiette de saucisses épicées et une omelette champignons et saucisses. Je n'ai pas goûté puisque je ne mange pas de viande, mais la serveuse a expliqué que l'assiette de saucisses, c'était des saucisses \"à hot dog\" assaisonnées avec un mélange d'épices maison. Disons que je m'attendais à mieux en allant manger sur la rue Bernard. 

Le service était malgré tout sympathique.

Je n'avais malheureusement plus faim pour essayer les pâtisseries, qui ont l'air sublimes. 

Prenez votre repas ailleurs, mais essayez les pâtisseries. C'est ce que je ferai la prochaine fois!"}
{"text":"What a charming little bistro. We came for a Saturday morning brunch and we were not disappointed. The majority of plates are Persian however you can still order a classic Nutella crepe. But why would you? The Persian dishes al look amazing. We had the omelette that was accompanied by a small bowl of walnuts and feta cheese, fresh baby tomatoes and a generous heap of mint leaves to add a beautiful scent to the dish. I was surprised with a 10% off coupon on Yelp after checking in. I showed it to our waitress but she didn't apply it to the bill. Coffee is nespresso."}
{"text":"Un bel endroit, bien tenu et délicat (assez rare à Montréal). Les plats (sandwichs salades, soupe) ont un excellent rapport qualité prix et beaucoup de saveurs. On est servi aussi vite que dans les restaurants rapides, mais on sort des chaînes au goût standardisé. Et puis, les desserts, c'est toute une expérience, à toute heure. Je vous recommande cette halte, un lieu et une cuisine très accessibles qui méritent d'être connus."}
{"text":"Best French pastries and macaron. Don't forget to taste a \"Sangak dishes\" special Iranian bread with Persian tea. The place is very cozy and the staff our very nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great ambience, very good service and they have the best pastries in town! And if you're looking for a place to try persian brunch, this is the right place for you, their brunch menu probably would be different than what you've tried before but it's awesome! Definitely worth trying! I really recommend this café"}
{"text":"I had come here last year on a Saturday around 3pm. We had ordered pastries and tea, I wasn't happy with the pastries. They were not fresh and the Persian was not good at all. So ai had initially given it a 1 star.  

But i have always been a strong believer of a second chance, so I came back for breakfast a year later and boy was I present'y surprised. 

We ordered provençale eggplant (mirza ghassemi)  with side of spicy bandari sausage. Wow this was the best mirza ghassemi and bandari sausage I have ever taste. So fresh, the spices and ingredients were perfectly mixed together. The portion were very generous this came with a basket of freshly baked baguettes also a tray with butter, feta and two kind of jams. Sour cherry jam and safran apple jam. I have never taste safran apple jam but it was out of this world. It was so good that I bought a jar of it.

We also ordered persane plate, which is basically a taster plate and makes you discover authentic Persian breakfast.

Although i am Iranian I was raised in Canada all my life and never really taste authentic Persian breakfast.  The best authentic breakfast I have tasted was Turkish breakfast, but after having tried the Persane plate that came with traditional Persian bread (sangak) I have now a new best authentic breakfast. 

The tea was also very good, 1000X better than last time.

I am really happy I came back, they deserve a 5 star for this kind of meal, also the waitress was super nice and very helpful.

Last but not least, we bought a few pastries too.
With all the stuff we had, I was expecting a very high bill but was very affordable.

We are already planning to come back next week and try their lunches."}
{"text":"A nicely decorated cozy place for a family brunch in Outremont.  Diverse and creative menu items were well prepared, and nicely presented at reasonable price.  The soft, low volume background music was a plus.  I even bought one of their delicious eclairs for a dessert (yummy, balanced, slender and soft, as it should be).   Our friend said their other bakery items were also very french-style, balanced in sugar or butter.   I will definitely visit this place again, the next time I visit Montreal."}
