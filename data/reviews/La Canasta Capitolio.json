{"text":"Overpriced crap. Within walking distance from my work and I was in a hurry so I came here. I'd been here years ago and it was crap then and is still crap now. There was a piece of chicken (?) and another piece of mystery meat in my cheese enchilada. $14 for lunch combo, chips and a drink!! Next time I'll make the drive to Chipotle or go hungry."}
{"text":"The best place to eat at anytime,  anyday! My most favorite day to eat there are on Saturday mornings  after a night out. The menudo particularly the red and a shredded chicken tacos definitely make the weekend! #lovethatchipsandsalsabar"}
{"text":"Want way too much food for lunch? This is the place! Every time I come here I get placed into a food coma. Feeling like treating yourself today? Go for the sopapillas with honey."}
{"text":"Working in the Capitol area for 15 years, La Canasta Capitolio is a must. There are very few places to eat near the Capitol, but La Canasta not only provides a place for a bite to eat, but some good food as well. I don't like veggies, so I generally stick to the red chili beef burrito, which is very good.  Prices are reasonable, too. I think their main business comes from the government workers in the area, and lot's of police and fifi's (firefighters).  If the PD and fifi's eat there, it must be good.  Free chips and salsa (very GOOD salsa) is a definite plus! Also, I've heard their breakfast burrito's are excellent."}
{"text":"EVERYTIME I go here I say to myself, LAST TIME. I have given this place too many chances to redeem themselves. Service is horrible. The staff there speak better english than they put off. When they \"try to\" fix their mistakes, never do they offer to be of further assistance and they try to pretend they dont speak good english. I suppose they dont know a smile is the same in all languages and can speak a thousand words. They are not helpful in providing food either. Too much small print for food that costs them nearly nothing. ie. chips are only served if its after ten am, you spend more than six dollars, you get your food for dine in (even though you wait FAR too long for your food), drink orders etc. The prices are outragous for mexican food, you would at least expect to be served kindly. Four dollars for a regular sized burrito that I can make in my kitchen for probobly .50 cents and a priceless amount of kindness is no charge! Dont dare ask for anything special like \"light ice\" or extra salsa (even though they are served in one ounce looking containers). You will get the evil eye with the side of excuses in another language I dont even believe is spanish.  THE only reason they are still in business is their location. HOWEVER, jack in the box is a four star next to them."}
{"text":"I love their smooth red salsa. I always get the #2 lunch - one taco (chicken) with rice and beans. Yummy. I drive from Gilbert to eat it."}
{"text":"Called in an order for a cheese crisp.  Got a cold tortilla with cheese that wasn't melted.  Sat down to eat and was chastised by owner for not ordering \"for here\" on the phone.  He told me my soda would cost $1 more.  I asked why.  He said if you take food to go, you fill up once and leave.  If you sit and eat, you get free refills.  I said, well, it's not free if it costs a dollar more.  Won't come back."}
{"text":"The food is just OK.
I tried to call in an order today for pick up.
The female that answered the phone told me that she could not ask the kitchen to package my taco separately form my enchilada because the kitchen yells at her when she asks them to wrap stuff separately.
WTF seriously, No I don't want my taco to sit in sauce so it can be soggy by the time I get back to work!
I am amazed at the lack of customer service in this place.
Last time we tried to go we had a big party and we told them a week in advance and then called again the day before to make sure there was a place for all of us to sit together. It didn't happed we all went and had to sit at 6 different tables What a retirement lunch that was! NOT
I won't be returning. for dine in or take out"}
{"text":"This review is based only on customer service. I work nearby and have been here many times over the past 2 years (drive through only). Today, I ordered a kid's meal, like I always have, and after paying and expecting my drink that comes with the meal, hmmm no drink. When I'm handed my food, I ask about my drink and was told it only comes with the kid's meal if a kid is in the car . . . wait, what? I said I always order a kid's meal and always get the drink. Not once did anyone ever ask if I had a kid with me or if the meal was actually for a kid but what difference should that make who's eating the meal! I'm still a paying customer! I was told that the other workers shouldn't have given me the drink! This is ridiculous! I was still charged the same amount. Do you think McDonald's would ever verify if that Happy Meal you order is actually for a kid?! Absolutely ridiculous! If I wasn't in such a hurry, I would have gone inside to confront someone about this .  . . whether or not it would make any difference who knows. The food is decent and because of lack of nearby options for people like myself who work in the area, they get business but I'd rather go out of my way for better service. Maybe they'll start checking your car for a kid before even being allowed to order the kid's meal!"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch whenever I am close by.  Everything that I have had is delicious, but the chimichanga is my favorite.  I also like the thicker flour chips that they have on the salsa bar.  It gets really busy at lunchtime, but I never have to wait very long.  They are usually really fast."}
{"text":"Thanks for the burrito de vomit
No pico
Second time and last I waste my money here..."}
{"text":"I think I am cursed when it comes to this place.

First time my cuddle buddy and I hit this place, we sat at the drive through window, in 104 degree heat, for 1/2 hour waiting for our food to come out.

At the drive through. 

For a half hour.

At the drive through.

Fast forward a few months, we head back over for lunch one afternoon. I order the same thing, a carne asada burrito. My chief cuddle granter orders a salad.

And then 20 minutes pass. 

On the upside, they gave us one drink this time, and it was only 89 outside, so this was a 100% jump in service? 

My cuddle buddy loves this place, I'm unimpressed. It might just be my curse that keeps me from loving it, as it is spicier than Bertos, but when my ever expanding gut line demands fast food burritos, it wants them quickly. La Canasta could take a lesson or two for dealing with junkies from any one of the several meth and crack dealers near by. Don't keep us waiting for our fix, we tend to get nasty."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos downtown. Wait can be a little long at the drive thru so don't come here if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"This is a little hole in the wall place that has great lunch specials. It's not particularly clean or delicious, but its fast Mexican food at decent prices. The lunch combo 5 is awesome. Bottom line: it's a fast & filling lunch place, but I'll never come here expecting a special or gourmet meal."}
{"text":"I observed the male manager tell a paying customer (who was sitting at a table waiting for her to-go order) that she was not to serve the salsa bar salsa in the water cups and asked to customer order a pint of salsa if wanted a larger quantity. 
Although I agree with the assertiveness of telling this customer about the option to buy the salsa, I disagree with what he did next...he took the small cup from her and poured her salsa back into the salsa bar container....not safe hygienic practice. They are not supposed to put any food back into the rotation after the food has been handled by the public.
Also, the taco shells are like taco bell shells. They do not make authentic crispy tacos. 
 Oh, and while I'm at it, the menu says \"3 flour tortillas\" with the breakfast dishes but they serve only one. They changed the prices on the menu so they should have corrected the other menu options while they were at it."}
{"text":"So here's the thing, I've been coming here for years.  Food was generally good, relatively quick and the chips/salsa bar has always been dependable (although I was bummed when they got rid of the pico de gallo a few years back).  Fast forward though, and lately it just hasn't been the same.  Food quality has been slipping, chip bar isn't as stocked, service is slower, etc.  Today was the last straw.  

First, they now charge a $2 surcharge for chips/salsa if you don't spend more than $5.  I get it, the economy is tight, but when you already charge $2.25 for a soda?   I was willing to forgive though, but when I got to the chip bar, they didn't have any of the flour chips out-or even a space for them.  So you pay for the chips, but the best ones aren't there anymore.  Then when I was eating my bean tostada, I bit down on something sharp --I spit it out and realized that a 1/2 inch sliver of a broken plate was in my food.  It broke when I bit down on it, so part of it disintigrated and I couldn't get it all out of my mouth.  While the manager did apologize and promptly brought me a new tostada, I definitely would have prefered a refund at that point since I could still feel broken glass in my mouth (not very appetizing). He brought me a refill of guac and that was it.   Being a long-time customer I expected better than that, esp. after such a dangerous, and frankly disgusting, mistake on their part.  That was it, I won't be back again."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken soup and it tasted like Campbell soup. The ground beef tasted like ground beef jerky."}
{"text":"They have consistently good food and delicious fresh made chips with salsa. Great prices for what you get."}
{"text":"Not worth it! Breakfast burrito was a little over $5 and was very small! I work in the area and should of known better from past visits. Go to Irmas Kitchen on 15th Ave, better food and portions are perfect!!"}
{"text":"Barely mediocre food and wildly unfriendly service earn this place two stars.  They have a captive audience in state government workers given the lack of restaurant choices in the Capitol area and perhaps that explains it.  The food is generally fresh but offers little in the way of taste.  The red sauce they use has a distinctly \"off\" flavor.  Everything is very greasy even by the standards of Mexican food.  This place is a cut below the Isbertos, Rolibertos etc. that are everywhere in the Valley.  The staff  seem to resent your presence.  To call them unfriendly wouldn't do it justice.  I've waited forever for the food to come and then had the barely warm food almost thrown at me.  Give this place a miss."}
{"text":"Mmm...La Canasta.  This is probably between a 3.5 and a 4.  What La Canasta really is is a great lunch/after work place where you can get a reasonably priced, full plate of food.  I always get the cheese enchiladas, and they are very yummy.  They also have a great chips and salsa bar, which comes with any meal."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite mexican food restaurants in Phoenix. Top 3 for sure, and that's saying a lot. Luckily I work close by so I'm able to come in quite a bit. The hot sauce is what keeps bringing me back. I could literally drink the stuff. When u enter you place your order and then it's brought out. So it's a combination of fast food, restaurant style. But the food is done right! Highly recommended if you work downtown and need a quick sit down lunch, or even if u love great Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is really a 3.5 but I'm going to bring it up to a 4 because it was quick and really inexpensive.

I don't really think I'm a Mexican food connoisseur by any means but I do know good food in general and I have to say I wasn't really impressed.  I mean I was expecting to be blown away, which I guess is my own fault.  My enchilada was no better than any other enchilada I've ever had.  The salsa was good but the chips were not...they almost tasted stale.  I did enjoy the patio area, it provided a good background for lunch with a group."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many, many times because it is close to my work and there are very few options within walking distance. Usually I get breakfast on days when I need to get breakfast, because at lunch I have time to drive someplace else. 

The food is usually pretty good and the service OK, too. But I've gotten sick to my stomach on a few occasions as well. If I didn't work close to here, I probably wouldn't return, but as I said options are limited."}
{"text":"Fully enjoyed every bit of my lunch combo #5. Taco. Enchilada and Bean burrito! Had to bring home the leftovers, smothered in salsa from their salsa bar. Yummo!"}
{"text":"Great, greasy Mexican food. I always enjoy their two taco lunch meal with rice & beans. The ground beef is very flavorful (although a bit greasy at times), and I enjoy their salsa -- it isn't chunky but it has a kick to it.  

And, perhaps, what may make El Capitolio most intriguing is its close proximity to the Capitol and state offices. If you are a bit of a politico like me, it is a great place to politician-watch.  You may be just minding your own business, enjoying a taco, when low and behold several politicians, big named lobbyists or state agency heads pull into a booth behind you.  Tuneup your ears and you may just get some good gossip. 

So, with a yummy taco in hand, and your eyes & ears open, you may just find yourself having a great meal and a possible \"You won't believe what I hear\" moment all in matter of a one-hour lunch."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!
Breakfast can't be beat. We showed up with a crew of 20 hungry construction workers and they easily accomodated us.

The machaca is outstanding. Hot fresh tortilla chips and tasty red salsa complement the delicious burros.

They even have two types of fresh brewed iced tea, an increasingly rare sight in restaurants."}
{"text":"There's a reason everyone calls this place La Canasty. Only saving grace is I can get a breakfast burrito at 6 am before I get to work.  Other than that the meat is grade D, like boiled meat, and the tortillas are really thick and never toasted on grill. Place is dirty as hell and prices are too high."}
{"text":"I had the chili on Wednesday.. the green one.

It was as yummy as it looked!

I had to give it one more star!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried La Canasta Capitolio was a couple of years ago and I will say I was a huge fan of the fish tacos. I'm always a little weary when I order fish tacos and realize they aren't fried in a large vat of fatty deliciousness but on occasion, grilled fish tacos are good too. I was pleasantly surprised by the spiciness and flavor... the first time. 

Time went on and I thought about these fish tacos with every intention on writing a yelp review but life happened.  School, work, errands, pets destroying the things I love, it was all just a little much and I eventually forgot about the duty I have to spread the word of great fish tacos. 

But I tried it again today. All the memories came rushing back as I approached the front door. I walked in and was immediately halted by the line of approximately 10 people. I ordered my food for pick-up but as there was no dedicated \"pick up orders\" sign I was unsure what to do. Wait in such a long line for a pick-up? That seems silly. After asking a customer who had no idea but kindly offered to save my spot as I journeyed up to the front of the line to inquire as to the proper procedure, I found out that indeed the second counter was for pick-ups. Yay for this. 

I got my fish tacos and they were okay; it wasn't the great experience I had on my first venture but I am sure there will be many more to come. The other reviews seem a little all over the place so I made a decision to write a review immediately after my consumption. Unfortunately, I do not think I'm adding to the clarity on the matter. Like others said, it is okay food, a little pricey, and it seems like they try to nickel and dime you with the extras. 

In conclusion it's okay food at a slightly above average price. I assume the folks here are gravely overestimating the salary of government employees (and us worse off poor interns), probably because the location will keep people coming in. That or they are trying to control the rush by charging a little more. I probably won't eat here on days I drive, but days I take the bus and need a quick bite within walking distance, I would not hesitate to go back. 

P.S. The bean tostada was delicious both times and quite consistent in quality."}
{"text":"So I have been here before and thought all was well so I'd try it again. Big Mistake. BIG. The boiled meat was way to chewy and guacamole was almost sour. It was particularly the fly infestation that grossed us out. Flies everywhere and this was inside not the patio! Beyond gross and the tables were disgusting. Won't be back again. Ever. Ever."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!

My first visit to this place was today. I decided to go with a friend and grab some tacos in the drive-thru. I ordered 2 chicken tacos and asked for a little sour cream and guacamole on each one. With a soda my total came to $10.49!!! I asked why it was so expensive. They told me they had to charge me for the sour cream and guacamole. I told them I wouldn't mind paying a little extra, but I didn't need an entire side order of each. I just wanted a little on each taco. I was okay with them charging my a little extra for this, but not THAT much extra! 

The lady at the drive thru asked us to pull forward to try and resolve my request. As we pulled to the pick-up window, the manager poked his head out. I told him what I ordered and asked him why it was so expensive. I told him I'd be willing to pay a dollar or so extra for the guac and sour cream, but I thought it was outlandish to pay that much extra for two tacos. His argument was that I would get more for my money. I told him I wouldn't eat all that extra sour cream and guacamole and that it would be a waste. I told him that I felt like I was wasting my time and that it seemed ridiculous to pay that much for two tacos with a little guac and sour cream. 

His response? \"Yes, I agree with you that this seems like a waste of time!\" REALLY? I couldn't believe I was getting such bad customer service and such an attitude from a manager. My friend and I were so put off that we drove away with no food and paying nothing. The owner of this place should be ashamed that they hired such a terrible manager.

My first impression of this place was horrible. NICKELING AND DIMING your customers is NOT the way to keep a customer base and a consistent clientele. I will NEVER go back! They just lost a customer and because I'm well-connected in the valley, they've probably lost all my friends as customers as well.

Not a good way stay in business in this economy, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"The good: 1) A great all you can eat chip bar with some pretty decent hot sauce. 2) A big patio to take a relaxed lunch at. 3) These crazy good green corn tamales with a strange cheese filling that is more like Kanufa then anything I've had at a Mexican restaurant.

The bad: pretty much everything else. The food is around (but below) drive through Filberto's quality at near restaurant prices. They even have the gaul to charge 2.25 for their crappy iced tea you serve yourself.

The worst part of this place is the meat they serve in their dishes which is absolutely horrid except for their machaca. I stick to bean burritos, cheese enchiladas, and the aforementioned green corn tamales if I go.

All of their tortillas and such taste store bought even though I think they make them themselves. And the horchata needs to be avoided at all costs as well.

For counter service Mexican, you gotta go with  La Tolteca if you are downtown. Or Caramba if you are on the west or north side."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the breakfast burritos here. I usually get the egg, bacon, and cheese. I am very picky about my bacon but La Canasta makes it super crispy, which is exactly the way I like it. The best part about this location is that they have a drive-thru. It's an easy way to get some breakfast on the way to work in a hurry."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for lunch!  They have very reasonable lunch specials and the salsa bar has both corn and flour chips.  They also have great breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"The Pico de gallo is gone, the water cups are big again and they have new green number tents.

Not much else has changed sinch my last review update. The flour tortilla chips are still the gem here. 

The red picante sauce is smooth and good enough to drink.

Al la carte is still where the deals are at.

The Patio is the place to be in this weather.

Chillie rellleno burrito is still eggy and unique."}
{"text":"Downtown traditional Mexican restaurant that offers a variety of your favorites. Not one of my favorite Mexican spots in the valley but they are decent and reasonably priced. The Chicken Tacos taste good but can be soggy as they don't drain the water they have the meat marinating in. The warm chips and salsa are a nice added touch. My favorite is their Taco Salad served in a Taco shell. 

The staff is always friendly with super fast service. You can dine in or outside. Unlimited beverages."}
{"text":"Flour tortillas chips are excellent. The menu has a green chili bowl listed and it's over either rice or beans.  I have had this several times and never get the rice or beans.  I don't understand why they don't give you more of the green chili since there's nothing else in the bowl.  It just seems logical and the right thing to do. It's very delicious but for the price, there's very little food.   Additionally the tables, chip and salsa holders are dirty. I can't imagine when they were last cleaned. Good food, lovely staff.. Just a few tweaks and it would be five stars."}
{"text":"Good Food At A Reasonable Price.

I haven't visited La Canasta Capitolio in some time, so I thought today would be a great day ro revisit.  

The food at La Canasta  is consistent and reasonably priced, especially the lunch specials. The service at La Canasta is good.  The wait staff and servers are very accommodating without being intrusive.

Today, I had the beef flautas and my lunch companion ordered the taco lunch special with rice and refried beans. Our entrees  were served quickly,  the food was fresh,  tasty, and reasonably priced. 

Good food, reasonable prices, and great service."}
{"text":"Venue is clean, and has good amount of both indoor and outdoor seating.  There is a drive through.  Service is friendly.  Food is good - pretty much on par with other similarly priced Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is average. The staff seems to be nice and speedy. The red burrito is decent but I'd skip the cheese enchilada it taste burnt and very dry around the edges."}
{"text":"Took 5 friends here for Sunday brunch, awesome as usual! The red chile is the best in town! They all agreed that it's old school Mexican worth driving from Scottsdale for."}
{"text":"Definitely still OG! I haven't been here for over 10 years at least and was headed to an appt when I almost passed it. I was thinking about something one of my nieces posted on FB and was like,  oh I have to stop in. 

It was just asi remembered,  as soon as you walk in the door you felt like you were home. Some of the same people are still working there, greeting and seating you. 

Lunch time,  packed as usual but worth it! I was seated right away got my drink and food ordered and it was just as delicious as I remember all those years ago. My taste buds went crazy!

I'll be coming back for sure! Great food and customer service!"}
{"text":"I go very often... Serivce is ok sometimes its GReat! I guess you have to cath them on a good day. Foos is pretty good if you dont want to ook it yourself. One of their salsa is amazing flour tortilla chips r AMAZING! NANAS Chile bowl is YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I am giving La Canasta 4 stars mainly because of location and their chips.  

I work in the Executive Tower at the Capitol and if you have been in that area, then you know that there are like no options for lunch other than the cafeteria at the DES building or the cafeteria in the basement of the Executive Tower. Frankly, there are some days where we want to escape the building but don't want to risk going downtown, which makes La Canasta a great option for those days.  Also, if you want political gossip, La Canasta is a great place because you can see the whos-who in politics at lunch and possibly overhear some good tidbits. Or you'll just hear staffers like myself and co-workers complaining about our jobs!

As I mentioned previously, the chips and salsa are delicious at La Canasta, but the rest of the food is just OK. It's nothing spectacular that warrants a special trip.  Soda and iced tea are $2.25 (unlimited refills) which is a tad high in my book.  The patio is nice to sit on especially when your office has no windows.  However, today upon leaving, we saw three birds on a table eating off some plates that were sitting on an empty table. I could have done without seeing that."}
{"text":"My favorite chips in the valley when served warm. As many will note, the service is not great or even very good for that matter but I do really like their machaca and chips. With that said, during lunch today I had the machaca meal that comes with tortilla, beans, and rice. All were tasty and hit the spot. I also ordered my usual horchata that always tastes good but always have thought their size for price is off. Overall, a good lunch spot that will satisfy your cravings but will not blow your mind."}
{"text":"Two stars because if they get your order right it tastes okay. Servers are apathetic, disinterested and often aggravated that customers are present."}
{"text":"This place absolutely is the worst. Poor excuse for food, high prices, and subpar service. They keep raising the prices and the food quality keeps getting worse.The only reason people eat here is because they're only one of a couple of choices for food around the Capitol."}
{"text":"I love this place! I used to eat here all of the time when I worked downtown. I wish I could eat here mor frequently,  something about their chicken enchiladas makes me want more"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and possibly had the worst Mexican food experience. If you like greasy Mexican food without flavor, than this is good for you. If you like fresh guacamole, homemade tortillas and authentic Mexican food with good flavor , don't bother. 
Staff was nice but they definitely need to hire a new cook."}
{"text":"It was my first time ever eating at this restaurant and I will never go back again. I had the Nana's Breakfast and there was something very strange about the over easy eggs. The yolks were very pungent and were way to thick for my liking, almost gummy. I could only eat half of one and moved the rest onto a small side plate. I am not a finicky eater at all but I just could not finish it. Then I moved on to the red chili. I could not eat this stuff. I was soo spicy hot, It was inedible. I did however eat the hash browns which was difficult because the egg was starting make a reappearance via a burpy aftertaste. 

So now I will forever respectfully refer to this place as La Ca-Nasty!"}
{"text":"I only been through the drive thur to order my food.  So the drive thur menu is very beat up, faded, and the prices are wrong.  However, your food is ready when we pulled up to pay.  I got the chimy chicken combo.  It was OK.  But the tacos my friend ordered looked very good!  I guess one of these days we will do another drive by."}
{"text":"I've gone to eat breakfast and I always get the Nana special.  I've has the red & green chili, both good.  Lunch, I get the chicken taco salad, also good.  Can't forget the all you eat chips & salsa.  Only small complaint is that they changed the salsa container or whatever you call it.  It's small and I had to get up a few times to get more...they remind me sushi restaurant would carry, where they put the wasabi & ginger...check out my pic.  But it won't stop me from going, just sucks for the dish washer person alot of those salsa container to wash. Lol"}
{"text":"La Canasta Capitolio has been serving the phoenix community for the last 51 years
their food is Authentic Mexican Food at its best.
Great Lunch Specials , the best Chimichangas in town! i know sometimes things are not perfect , but whenever the wonderful owner Diane is at the Restaurant things Run Smoother , theres not such a thing as perfection , so you Yelpers (me) before you write anything about a a Restaurant make sure to let the Owner or the General Manager know what the issues are so they can be corrected , dont just go one time and come to yelp.com and start bad mouthing restaurants it is not good for food business , once you let them know about a problem and the problem continues the  think about what you will write in a Restaurant Review. 
think before you write please.
La Canasta Capitolio  gets my 5 stars Review because the service was A plus , the food was Delicious and in that specific day the owner Diane was there and she is the Friendliest person , i will make sure to go back there as often as possible."}
{"text":"Some things are better than others. Beef taco is a ground beef in store-bought hard shell, prefer shredded beef in a handmade/fried shell. Burrito can be plain and dry, best to get enchilada style. They don't serve any extras, just the items (i.e. No lettuce, cheese, or tomatoes on the side). Best part is the free chips and salsa (corn and flour chips, chunky and smooth salsas-both red) It's a good place for big groups."}
{"text":"Called to complain about my order picked up in the drive thru before i could explain my situation the manager talks over and was extremely rude....pretty sad"}

Explain how this can happen? This is less than 24 hrs later"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch specials nice people and fast service.  Love lunch special #2 and the taco salad"}
{"text":"Super disappointed with this place. I ordered the taco combo lunch special, which is supposed to come with 2 tacos, rice and beans. I got back home to eat it and realized that they only gave me 1 taco, rice and beans. It even looked like they positioned the taco to make it seem like they were stacked so I wouldn't notice easily. 

I got a side of guacamole, which was BROWN when I got it (see photo). I still ate it because I paid $2.20 for a tiny thing of it (super expensive compared to competitors in area). It was flavorless and unimpressive. 

On top of that, I ordered chips and hot sauce which is listed on their website as one cost. I got back home and realized that they tacked on an extra charge for hot sauce. .15 cents, but seriously? If they are doing this to everyone, they are making money off of nothing. 

Literally the ONLY thing this place has going for them is their salsa. It's really good. But with all of the other things stacked up against them, I won't be coming here again. 

My tip-check your bags before you get home. They short you food and give you browned guacamole!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is extremely close to the Capitol as the name implies and they lean on a captive government employee base to remain open. The only reason that this place remains open is because many people need someplace in walking distance. The servers are either rude and unaccommodating or eerily cheery and overly familiar. I consistently receive food any way but how it was ordered. I have personally been treated as if I am trying to cheat them over the salsa bar because my tostada order is inexpensive, despite being comfortable with the extra charge for orders under 5 dollars. As a vegetarian, they have frequently gotten meat in my order and without any intention to correct the issue. And when it comes to customer service, the owners create this culture of deplorable service by exhibiting the worst service of any in the bunch. The final straw was today when the cashier swept my friend's card repeatedly without recognizing the terminal was dirty and would not read it. Her solution was to simply turn him away without offering to ring at another register or even asking for other payment. I really wish they would close down and make way for a sandwich shop or something."}
{"text":"Great place for local Mexican food. Very popular place for State employees working on the Capitol Mall.  All the lunch specials are great and inexpensive (I love the rice and beans).  Regular combos are much larger than the lunch combos (food coma anyone?)

They have a salsa and chip bar for dine-in only.  If you want to take out, I suggest ordering over the phone.  Otherwise, service is slow."}
{"text":"Diane and her staff did an AMAZING job catering our son's wedding rehearsal dinner at Encanto Park Clubhouse !  Our guest loved La Canasta's Fiesta Buffet from the catering menu, it had a little bit of everything. The evening would not have been a success without them.  Thank you thank you thank you La Canasta Capitolio !"}
{"text":"Out of all the La Canastas in town, this is my favorite. Mostly due to the chip and salsa bar. The flour tortilla chips are so good! The salsas are really good too. I have not had a bad meal here. I  really like the Nana's Bowl either red chili. Their red chili could be the best in town. They also have great lunch combos. You will definitely be full when you leave. 
It does get crowded from time to time, but they have an outdoor patio. Too bad the patio is only useful for part of the year."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for years and have never had a bad meal.  In my opinion, they have the best red and green sauce around.  I usually stick with the tacos, nana's favorite, the chili, and the beef and cheese burrito.  yes, it is basic sonoran fare but it is better than most mexican joints i have been to in the valley."}
{"text":"Not good experience today, came in for Tamale , chips n Salsa my Tamale had a piece of meat and the rest masa a waste of my money!"}
{"text":"I really was not very impressed with the quality of the food. The meat was very dry and the sauce they used to disguise it in was bland and greasy. Yea, yea I know it's mexican food so I should expect some grease, but a puddle of yellow oil surrounding the plate? Yuck. The only redeeming quality was the chips and salsa bar. The tomatillo and adobo salsas were excellent. Not good enough for me to return, but made the wait bearable."}
{"text":"I really love this place. I use to live really close by. The enchiladas the tacos the quesadillas and the nanas bowl are all really delicious. The service is also really great. The chips and salsa bar are great. The two different chips are the best. The only thing i think that they can change and why i knocked off 1 star is because half of the dining area is always closed off. Some time i am forced to eat next to dirty dishes or a dirty table that they haven't had a chance to clean. Giving us that extra space and using it for what it is intended for would be nice."}
{"text":"First timer. Impressed with the food and the dining room. But the dining room confuses me, because it has the look and feel of a full service restaurant. But in fact it is counter service. The food is good. I will go back, but for my taste, it is a little pricey for counter service. Although the food is in fact delivered.  The staff is very friendly. I do like getting my own chips from the chip bar. Looking forward to going back, but can't go often. Nice job folks."}
{"text":"I consider myself an expert in green chili chimis and La Canasta has a pretty good one. One the down side- they don't know how to give back correct change."}
{"text":"Bacon or chorizo breakfast burritos are AMAZING! Chips and hot sauce are great too if dining in."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning twice.  
Never going back here again.  
 Ordered a breakfast egg potato. 
And 1 : nanas special."}
{"text":"Following the La Canasta tradition, this location hits it out of the ballpark. The food is great, the prices are extremely similar to the other La Canasta locations and they have a chip/salsa bar!!! The flour chips are delicious; not greasy and very easy to consume too many if you aren't careful. My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"La Canasta is very close to my work.  They have great breakfast burritos for under $3.  The lines in the morning are non existent, so that's good.  The lines at lunch are a lot longer, but the kitchen is really efficient and cater to people with short lunch breaks.  I would recommend going before 11:30 though.  The lunch specials are my main staple for lunch and it'll likely fill you up.  I have no idea how authentic it is (Mexican) because I haven't been to Mexico but only a handful of times, but it tastes great. 

They have a drive thru and you can get take out.  I believe you can call ahead too for take out.  You can also order chips and dip in bigger quantities for a meeting or even for your portion of a potluck. 

Hint, they may not advertise this, but you can get $.99 tacos on Tuesday for lunch."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food, best cheese enchiladas! 
All the food reminds me of stuff my grandmother used to make , we make the trip all the way from Litchfield Park just to eat here."}
{"text":"La Canasta is close to work and has an excellent chips and salsa bar.  The breakfast burros are fabulous too.  But the lunch part, not so good.  I need to remember to just go for the breakfast burro (they have a drive through!) and be done with it.  I ate on the patio once for lunch with a group and we were attacked by pigeons, some found it funny, I was not humored by it but in fact scared, I hate pigeons!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great food at a reasonable price. The chips and salsa are self serve and it always seems like they keep replenishing them."}
{"text":"Food is good super dirty floors and tables around lunch time like they don't have enough staff but I will go again because the food is pretty good. Tamales were a bit dry other than that it was good"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, salsa bar, big selection of food and drinks.
Carne Asada burrito is good"}
{"text":"Okay breakfast.  The young lady told me that I couldn't have chips and salsa while ordering take out.  Sad face.  I still ate them anyway"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good but horrible service. We went for lunch on Monday and stopped in about 11:15. After ordering one person waited 50 minutes for their lunch. The table next to us waited just as long. 

We asked where our food was each time the waitress came by and they said there was a problem. After asking the 4th time and asking to speak to a manager, they said the manager was busy. 

If you don't mind waiting 50 plus minutes for lunch this is the place for you."}
