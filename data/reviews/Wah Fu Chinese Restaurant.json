{"text":"We have been going to Wah Fu for many, many years and never had a bad meal.  The owner Tony is great and always friendly and welcoming.  His manager however is rude and makes you feel like she is doing you a favor.  I believe her attitude filters down to the rest of the staff.  This has been going on for awhile now and we've decided to eat elsewhere.  Great food if you want to put up her attitude."}
{"text":"Friendly staff; but terrible food...honestly.  I wish I could write good things about the food but it just wasn't.  Sorry.  I am simply hoping I don't get sick. :/"}
{"text":"I have always found the food at Wah Fu to be good. The table service was poor best described as inattentive. Take out service is fast. The cashier is efficient and not really looking to establish a rapport with customers."}
{"text":"Good food and price is good.  Place could use a good cleaning up though. It's a bit dirty on the doors/walls/floor. Maybe they should remodel soon.  Unclean restaurants makes me wonder what the kitchen looks like,Ya know?  The service is very nice to you and they treat you good. I eat there frequently and have not had a bad meal yet."}
{"text":"Great food. The Won-ton soup is the best you'll ever have. Been going here for many years."}
{"text":"Took the family there for first time because of reviews.  Everything was outstanding.  Wonton soup was the best.  Everything was very fresh and hot.  Huge portions!  Great value!"}
{"text":".Great food love the soup and crab ragons.best Chinese redcurrant around. Love all the people that work thete"}
{"text":"Probably the worse take out I have had since moving to Cleveland. Almost  the entire order was wrong and it should've been a sign when I went back to get it and there was no name on the bag and he asked what I order and he just handed me a bag.General Tso's no breading and flavorless, low mein definitely no lo mein.. egg rolls dry but my wife loved her sweet and sour chicken.."}
{"text":"I just recently moved into an apartment complex nearby with my vegetarian friend and I liked the food a lot."}
{"text":"This was the best Chinese food in town for many years. Sad to see it has gone down hill. My food was not the same as always. Sweet and sour no flavor and watery. Chicken was like rubber. Oh well"}
{"text":"Wow.  I was really surprised to find any positive reviews for this place, let alone so many.  This is overall one of the very worst restaurants I have ever been to.  We stopped here on a whim just because we saw it as we drove past and we were hungry.  This experience makes me understand the people who prefer to always eat at chain restaurants so they know what they're getting.  My companion had wanton soup and szechuan chicken; I had hot and sour soup and vegetable chow mein.  Her soup was so bad she didn't eat it; mine was also not good.    Hot and sour soup is one of the things I always get to test out a new Chinese place, and this is one of the worst I've had.  It had a very cloudy appearance, almost like gravy.  Neither of our entrees were good.  Mine was almost exclusively bean sprouts, and had not much flavor at all.  Hers just had a bad taste.  The worst were the sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard they keep on the table.  They were so watery and oddly dark brown.  I didn't want to eat anything on my plate that they touched because it seemed like they must certainly be spoiled.  The service was fine.  The bathrooms looked clean, but smelled awful, like rotten food."}
{"text":"Been to this spot many times in the past, and I don't remember it being this bad. Just got takeout, and the lady that took my order just kept yelling \"what else\", should've known from the start.  Got the gold standard General Tso's chicken. In one word, disappointing. 3 pieces of small breaded chicken and the rest was giant pieces of raw green pepper. They obviously try to make this dish seem large without putting any substance into it. The hot & sour soup was on point, the rest of the meal was about par.   TL;DR  Better off going somewhere else"}
{"text":"Modern foodies will scoff at what I call the \"American Chinese\" restaurant that was so common when I was growing up in the 70's.  With so many new traditional and \"modern fusion\" places on the map, the old school places tend to get left behind. If I have a taste for the American Chinese style of my youth (and think of that long gone place on Fulton that my grandma and grandpa would take me or the one on Biddulph where my parents would go) this is definitely one of the better choices. I particularly like the won ton soup and there is always something about the deep taste of the Oolong tea in this type of place.  The staff is lovely and the prices are reasonable. If you are looking for a bit of history, this might be your stop."}
{"text":"Not quite sure what happened.  Have been here for take out numerous times and dined in a couple times as well.  While never special by any means this time it was the worst take out ever in my life.  Not just Chinese but the worst food period.  Ordered the Kung Pao shrimp (spicy) and shrimp lo mein.  They both rated like they were made with bath water from the dog groomer.  Also had 4 soggy egg rolls.  Guess that is the end of Wah Fu for me.  It sure weighed a lot for 28 bucks but so does a bag of dog food.  I decided to call and let Tony know that something went terribly wrong the night B4.  I started out by telling him I am or at least was a repeat customer and that I didn't want anything except to let him know.   He basically said it was impossible and that I should have called the night B4 and started to get beligerent.  I told him thank you and hung up.  Adios \"Tony\"  nice knowing you"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and every time I leave stuffed and happy. Since we normally eat family style I've tried a large portion of the menu and liked most everything. Some favorites though: The Thai soup is AMAZING. The sesame chicken and pepper steak are also super tasty. Bonus- free tea if you dine in!   I finally got around to writing this review because I had Chinese in columbus yesterday and at wah fu today and the difference is just so noticeable. Super fresh and much better flavors than just salty."}
{"text":"I crave their wonton soup during the cold winter days. Best in CLE IMHO. My wife grew up on Wah Fu and converted me when we met. I have tried a good portion of the menu and have never had a bad meal there. We love the egg rolls and I usually go with Empress chicken extra hot. The chicken is all white meat and very lightly battered. Haven't had better empress/general tso's anywhere. My wife is a sucker for the chicken subgum and I admit I wasn't crazy about it at first but over time I developed a liking for it. The veggies are so fresh and the sauce has a great flavor. And of course you have to top it off with crispy noodles. We also love the veggie fried rice...once again freshness comes into play. The portions of everything are large and we always end up taking some home. The service is usually friendly and pretty quick. Whenever we crave Chinese we make the trek into Middleburg from Brunstucky and we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"I wanted something warm and comforting on this blustery evening.  I've driven by this restaurant quite a few times and decided Chinese food sounded good tonite.  So I placed a takeout order of Chicken Chop Suey and General Tso Chicken.  Two of my favorites.  But......when I sat to eat.....it was the absolute WORST Chinese food I've ever had. It was literally inedible.  The Chop Suey tasted like it was out of a can.  The General Tso was so bitter and salty I couldn't eat it.  I gave it all to the dog.  :(  VERY disappointing.  Do not waste your money.  Oh and also, I ordered two meals and got only one rice in my bag."}
{"text":"This,  without a doubt, is my favorite Chinese restaurant in all the world.  Since moving to Houston,  I have struggled to find quality Chinese food like I grew up with at Wah Fu. I still haven't found anything half as delicious.  The wonton soup, shrimp chips, shrimp toast and bbq ribs are the perfect starters. The eggrolls are awesome, too - they have the standard shrimp eggrolls, or a vegetarian version for those with shellfish issues.   For dinner, I always choose between the sweet & sour chicken or lemon chicken dishes. Ordering the combination is the smart way to go. Everything has consistently been delicious and served hot! You just can't beat it. Tummies are sooo happy and fulfilled when it's time to go. :)  I cannot wait for my next visit home! First stop= Mom & Dad's. Second stop? As always = Wah Fu!!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure today is the last time Im getting food from this place. It used to be pretty good food but the last three times have been a disappointment that I was hoping would change. Tonight I ordered a chicken dish that was supposed to be served with broccoli and a spicy sauce. Instead, I got the same mix of crinkle cut carrots, water chestnuts, onions, and broccoli that is served with every other dish in a bland and not at all spicy sauce. The chicken tasted like it had been cooked the third time right before they gave it to me and was awful. The customer service is nonexistent and the only good thing about this the place is the speed, but that's probably because they only throw together reheated ingredients in one of four combinations anyway. I know this place has a great following, and I used to be in that group, but I'm done. If you want decent food, seek elsewhere."}
{"text":"BEST Chinese in Cleveland! I continue to make the mistake of trying to find an equal. I haven't come close. The family ownership of Wah Fu must be the missing ingredient everywhere else. Can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"I'm sad to have to write this review! I have many fond memories of Wah Fu's growing up and have eaten here many times. I will still come here but narrow my selections down to a few items. My sister found a wooden bristle in her food, the manager said it was from the brush that they use to clean the wok. My Chicken Sub Gum was not so good, the fried rice was flavorless. I ended up with Egg Fu Young and it was decent. The waitress was great and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"If there could be a minus review I would have selected that. The egg roll was dripping in grease on the outside and full of really old celery on the inside. Gross. The $10 General Tsoa chicken came with three peices of chicken and the cashew chicken was full of celery again. Will not eat there again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite chinees ressturants to go to you will not find mall quality food here. I usually get sesame chicken its always a nice crisp coating to the breading unlike if you go to a hole in the wall its always soggy breading the employees are always very respectfull and curtious to their customers a very nice family owned resturant and the decor is pleasant to see then alot of resturants ive seen."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Large portions. Reasonable price. Very friendly staff. Would def recommend if looking for a place to eat before going to the airport"}
{"text":"My wife and I and another couple went for dinner we were satisfied. Portions were very generous, prices good, food above average but not great"}
{"text":"Pork fried rice was really good, wonton soup was ok, lo-mein and other main dishes were almost inedible because they were drowning in some unidentified type of greasy sauce that was unlike any other I've had at a Chinese place."}
{"text":"So far the best rice and general tso's chicken I've had of any Chinese restaurant I had at Wah Fu. The service was nice and fast. The food was really good (best quality chicken of any of the Chinese places I've been too in the past). I wish i lived closer to this restaurant so i could go here more often.   I definitely would like to go back to Wah Fu if given the chance."}
{"text":"You know what, the food alone is worth it and most of the staff is great! Maybe caught me on a bad day last time."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place. Staff are rude and don't really show a need to cater to the guest. They seem to have the mind set that \"who cares if you never come back\" so I will definitely not come back. Now if customer service isn't important to you, the food is pretty good. So you might actually enjoy this place. For me....3 stars"}
{"text":"If you like quality and good taste, do not eat here.  Everything was awful!  So sad, this location would've been very convenient to pick up on my way home from work once in a while.."}
{"text":"How does this have bad reviews? I have been going here since I was literally born nearly thirty years ago. Tony and his mom/family have been at the restaurant nearly every time I've gone, sometimes once a week, for years. They have the absolute best fried rice and sweet & sour chicken you will EVER have, along with the chicken subgum chowmein, beef lo-mein and wonton soup. I have been to both coasts as a resident and everywhere in between, and Wah Fu is hands down the best you will ever find. I'm hoping Tony will give me his recipes one day!"}
{"text":"Very inconsistent and rude service when picking up. Again we try to support our local places but they seem to have a sense of entitlement don't get it. Saw another review about lousy general tso , I've ordered it the last couple of times and has been bland no meat or very bitter, or I got a chow me in dish instead that went in the garbage. Good luck,used to be good even if hostess is moderately hostile."}
{"text":"Best Chinese so far in the Country! We visit each year from California and you can't beet the price, the beautiful interior, and great service. They have the best Wonton soup ever!"}
{"text":"Not good at all anymore. This place used to be great. The hot and sour soup tasted only like vinegar. The szchechaun chicken was only heat, no flavor."}
{"text":"I ate at Wah Fu on a Monday night with a very large group.  The restaurant was able to split the checks, which is always so helpful.  We were seated at one long table which made it nice as well.  I ordered the three-course dinner with pop and cookie.  The pot stickers were ok.  The egg roll came with shrimp in it, which I should've asked about, because I don't like seafood.  The egg drop soup didn't have any flavor and was thicker than I would've liked it to be so I ate very little of it..  My entree, General Tso Chicken, was very good.  The medium spice was just right, and I was pleasantly surprised to receive fried rice instead of white.  I think that if I had just ordered the entree without the starters that I would've given a higher rating."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the southern suburbs. It seems like they use fresh chicken instead of the frozen nuggets/cubes that some places use. I mostly carry out, so I can't speak to the friendliness of the staff too much, but they have been quality the times I have dined in"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on the advice of some co-workers.  Overall, it was an ok experience.  Not the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it it was a solid entry for American-style Chinese on the west-side.   The service was a little slow, but it was the lunch hour and it was pretty busy, so at the very least the delay understandable.  The prices were comparable this type of place - lunch specials in the $6-7 range with other dishes running a bit higher.    Other than that, there wasn't anything remarkably good or bad about Wah Fu which is to say if you are looking for decent Chinese in the area it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"I can't believe what a poor experience we had with carryout today. The General Tso's chicken had only 7 small pieces of chicken, but tons of green pepper and onion. I've never seen that in Tso, and I was disappointed. The sauce was a flavorless brown gravy. When we called, the girl on the phone was rude, unapologetic and said that everything comes prepackaged. So.... how are you a Chinese restaurant if you just open up bags and heat them?  The orange chicken had not even a hint of orange. My sister said the Sweet n Sour was pretty decent, but overall we were highly disappointed. There are plenty of other Chinese places on the West Side we will call next time."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for a great Chinese dinner. Tony and his family are wonderful and I always love going there for the food and the beautiful atmosphere.   I love the way we can just sit and relax as a family there. We eat then open the fortune cookies and laugh as we are trying to say the Chinese names on the back. The lucky numbers are great too. Always rub the Budda's belly when leaving. This time I hugged him for good luck."}
{"text":"Their food is probably the best chinese anywhere within 20 min of Middleburg Heights.  Where they misstep a bit is their customer service.  I don't think they like their job.  They probably figure as long as their food is a \"hit\" people will forgive a small lack of warmth from the staff.  Let me be clear, they are not rude, they do take care of you and your table's needs.  But the experience of eating there, whether in house or take out, feels like a business agreement rather than being welcomed to a friend's home for dinner.  We'll keep going though, because I'd rather have luke-warm service with great food than vice versa."}
{"text":"Best Chinese on the west side Hands down! Tony does a nice job making you feel welcome. The food quality is always great and done quite quickly too. I love the egg Fu young, and schashwan chicken, but honestly all of the food is good! It has been great for years and continues to be consistently good year and yeah again. Love this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently moved to Middleburg Heights, so naturally, we wanted to find a local Chinese takeout place for when we just absolutely need to have some Chinese food.  We found Wah Fu, scanned the menu, and ordered: wonton soup,  pot stickers, fried wontons, the house special lo mein, General Tso chicken, lemon chicken, and some egg rolls.  It was decently priced, which was great since we ordered A LOT of food.  Unfortunately, the saving grace from all of that food was the wonton soup.  A lot of what we ordered was pitched.  The lo mein had absolutely no flavor whatsoever and the noodles weren't what was traditionally served for lo mein.  My boyfriends General Tso chicken was absolutely LOADED with onion, which made us think they were trying to make up for lack of flavor.  The egg rolls were alright, and the lemon chicken tasted sort of plain.  I didn't happen to try the fried wontons, but my friend said they were good.  Lastly, the pot stickers were okay - they were slightly undercooked and the sauce that came with it was way too salty.  The quality of the food was disappointing, but at least we tried a place local to us.  For all I know, it was just a bad night, but I would be hesitant to try Wah Fu again."}
