{"text":"For the price this is the creme de la creme of Chines Buffet's.  Okay, not because of it's asthetics ... but the food is always fresh.  They keep it loaded up.  The price is THE best.  

It's a smaller buffet, but with better quality.  And the price is low.  
Lastly --- the price is great --- the food tastes better!"}
{"text":"Most horrible buffet I have ever been to.

My boyfriend and I are big chinese buffet fans. A ton of them have raised their prices recently (and, not surprisingly, have been closing down left and right).. so the prospect of a good buffet at 5-8 dollars was absolutely amazing. We read all the reviews on yelp and I had high hopes.

Dear lord. The food is awful here. Inedible. Tastes very distinctly like a bad frozen dinner.  The only thing I remember being remotely food-like was some kind of beef and onion dish.. which tasted a bit like a philly cheesesteak. not exactly asian fare..

I tried really hard to like this place. My boyfriend didn't like any of it either. I don't understand how they have such good ratings. The ONLY thing I like about this place is their dessert bar, because they have toppings for the frozen yogurt. It always annoyed me how so many buffets don't even have sprinkles.. so they've got that going for them.. though I think I'll just go to Mojo or Yogurtland. haha.

In short, I don't understand how anyone can eat this garbage."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food and GREAT prices. $4.99 for lunch and $7.99 for dinner you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Went back for another lunch a week ago and the quality had dropped so far down that we will not be back. The server was good and attentive, but the food was not tasty or attractive."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with Robyn N. and Rand H.and for $4.99 you get a pretty good lunch. They have quite a few trays of food and some were good but most were just OK. The deep fried chicken wings were real good and they had a soup they called Mexican soup that had beef tongue in it , it was not bad but out of place in a Chinese buffet.the staff here are very nice and friendly ,I wish all the other places I have been were like that.So for a good cheap lunch head over to Chinese Gourmet Buffet."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with Rand H. I started with the Mexican soup which was very good for a Chinese buffet. The main dishes were all OK ,with nothing really screaming YUMMMM. but the grand re opening special of $4.99 it was a great value. To many better Chinese buffets close by. I think they will struggle here.I give them 6 months and it will close again."}
{"text":"I ran into an ex-waitress of this restaurant recently and I was told that the ownership indeed changed and that the new owners were clueless.  Hence most of the staff left (allegedly).  I also heard that this place has now gone out of business.  Anyone know if this true?"}
{"text":"We chose this place because it is less than half of the price of Pacific, ($17) and had better reviews than Crazy ($15). With 2 adults and 2 teenaged boys, I wanted to keep it under $60. We did that, but we didn't even come close to eating $20 worth of food. 
First - the not so good stuff: The orange chicken was gummy as though it had never been crisp, or if it had, it soaked in the sauce for way too long. The spicy chicken was mostly just onions, not much chicken. They even messed up the fried donuts - they were hard.
Now the not so bad stuff: The grilled chicken skewers were the best thing I tried. They were nicely seasoned, and not overcooked. The Mongolian grill was a nice feature, and if you don't like what you got there - you probably made some bad choices. The desserts were fine - cut up lemon and chocolate bundt cakes and soft serve with sprinkles and sauce.
The staff were super friendly and it was clean.
If you need a place to go to fill up a bunch of hungry kids, who are happy with just having a big selection rather than a few great items - this could be the place for you."}
{"text":"I like it, the food is good and spicy and for $4.90 for weekday lunch, all you can eat,  you can't get a sandwich from Subway for that."}
{"text":"I took takeout so my review will be somewhat limited. 

First impression ... you come in and the place looks tired. Not bad, but kind of like \"I wish you would go away so I can rest\" tired. 
Wouldn't want to actually eat there, but for the 10 minutes it took it was ok. Didn't try Mongolian but it looked ok.

Can't beat the takeout. $6.99 (takeout or reinstated price?) for a 3 section styrofoam box that you can fill to your little heart's content. As long as the lid can close comfortably ... there is a sign to this effect.

The buffet was average. I stuck to the appetizer-type stuff and filled it up. Ultimately it was enough for 2 or 3 meals. Not bad for a set price. However, if you're craving quality Chinese, this is not it. Not by a long shot. Good for a day when you're not picky about taste (not bad, mind you) or content.

Takeout also came with a container for soup. The hot and sour did look awesome, with large chunks of tofu, and it was one of the better ones I have tried. Upon request, the attendant also filled a large bag of crispy noodles for me to take along. They did have little cups for sauces, but the hot mustard looked plastic and congealed. Scary to eat, scary to taste so I left it there. And there was no plum sauce to mix it with.  

I was surprised that they didn't have a regular menu also, but all buffet, all the time ... 

will I go again ? one of life's questions, yet to be answered. And asked ..."}
{"text":"Huge place with comfortable seating.  That's all the positive things I can think to say about it.  My fiance stopped eating halfway through his plate for fear that he'd be sick if he continued.  I soldiered through, because I had been craving chinese buffet all day.  I took a sip of the hot and sour soup and could barely even recognize what I was tasting.  It was just WEIRD.  The orange chicken and sesame chicken weren't too bad, but just about everything else was too dried out (we were there at 6 so it should have been fresh), or was overloaded with large pieces of onion.  Someone got lazy with the chopping, I guess.  We didn't try the mongolian bbq.  Maybe that would have been okay, but we'll never know, because we won't be going back."}
{"text":"A few years ago when I lived in Chandler I used to go to this buffet every once in awhile with family. I remember it being decent, not amazing. Today my boyfriend and I were in the area and the first place I drove us to ended up being shut down to my horror, so it was lunch at the chinese buffet. We were greeted warmly at the register and paid for the food and drinks then given a ticket to put at the table we sat at. 

Most of the food was fresh and hot, almost too hot! I love that they had mei fun noodles, the thinner rice version of chow mein. The sweet and sour sauce was on the runny side but still had good flavor. Everything tasted better than ok which means yay in my book!

Dessert was carrot cake, angel food cake, lemon cake, a soft serve machine, and various cookies and lollipops. I tried the lemon and carrot cake with a small bowl of soft serve. Yum! 

It's good to know this place is still here, even the Garcia's that used to be in the same plaza has been replaced!"}
{"text":"This used to be my spot for filling up on cheap Chinese. It's got a small variety of dishes, mostly some variation of chicken. Not the best, but kudos to them for the terriyaki chicken on skewers. It's amazing and no other buffet does it as well.

Most importantly, there's a Mongolian grill. Have fun mixing beef, chicken, or shrimp with your choice of vegetables, noodles, and sauces. I love mixing the minced garlic with cooking wine, but maybe I'm just weird like that. Try it anyways.

Minus one star for going a bit downhill over the years...only soda/tea as beverages. I missed the guava punch, or even the cheap orange juice from concentrate. It was refreshing. Also, I'm cross with them for no longer having pork or lamb (imagine all you can eat lamb cooked to your order!), so I don't think I can get excited anymore.

Still though...I just can't give 2 stars to a place with a Mongolian Grill. Chinese Gourmet is a-ok with me!"}
{"text":"Gotta support this place!

Sure, it is not the very best Chinese buffet. But it's not bad, and these guys took the plunge and rolled back their prices. This is the definition of a good value.

The variety is decent, maybe a bit smaller than some, but they keep it fresh and the taste is pretty good. They also have the now-expected Mongolian BBQ and a small variety of sushi. Not a lot of surprises, it's the usual Chinese-American fare, but generally fresh and, as I said, cheap. 

Service was also very good, attentive, friendly and fast. The atmosphere is about what you would expect from an older Chinese buffet. 

If you live in the area please check it out. I hope they are rewarded for lowering their prices."}
