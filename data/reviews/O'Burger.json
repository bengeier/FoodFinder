{"text":"I work very near this restaurant and decided to give it a try. Walking in, the decor is nice and clean (comfortable chairs), and you realize just how small this restaurant is. However, most people would be eating out on the terasse anyways. Service is a bit slow for a burger place. I ordered a simple hamburger with mixed fries. Overall, the burger was not bad. However, for the price I was paying for it, I was just expecting something more. The beef patty tasted like something out of Harvery's (right consistency and juiciness, but absolutely no flavour). The fries themselves were great. What is great about this place is that they do serve alcohol. So, if you're looking for a place to hangout to drink and eat okay food with a bunch of buddies after work during summer out on a terasse, this place is great. If your a burger enthusiast, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Endroit sympathique ambiance calme quand on souhaite ce détendre un peu , déco sympas , serveuse accueillante , bonne cuisine pour ma part j'avais pris le boston qui était excellent.
Bon on a tourné trois fois dans l'avenue avant de le trouver mais sans regrets =-p"}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday lunch while visiting relatives, we had a very positive experience overall. Outdoor seating was a little tight but great views and pleasant service. Chicken sandwich was GREAT, and my family loved the burgers,interesting Poutine selection, great as an appitizer!"}
{"text":"The patties are frozen store patties - that's a big no no for me when I'm paying more than what I would pay at Mc'Donalds or Wendy's. They're not even good frozen patties either! They're bland mixed with more bland! 

The seasoning needs a lot work as well, guess what? It's also pretty bland. 

I did what I always do when going to rate food, I follow it up with a mass produced version of what I had. 

So, I had a Quarter Pounder brought it home and added the ingredients that were missing.

The QP was much better and it was 7 dollars!"}
{"text":"Went there after work with a friend yesterday,

We took a table outside since it was nice and breezy. Had a pitcher so white sangria, some chicken wings and fried calamari.

The food seems fine, the sangria was good though it could use more alcohol.

The batter for the calamari is very peppery and the calamari were tender and fresh. The fried chicken wing were a bit over fried and seemed dry but the sauce was really good so it was fine. The place closes at 9pm so no really a place you can linger and chat for long, but it's a nice place to sit and rest if you're downtown shopping.

Maybe I'll try a burger next time lol"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, contrary to other reviews, the place was packed !!!
Our waitress was overwhelmed but still pleasant, it took 45 min to get our burgers. Tasted ok (I had the Dallas), fries were disapointing. The place seemed understaffed, our waitress had to tend to the cash while trying to get customer orders to the tables. Also the fact that the kitchen is in the basement might explain why it takes so long to get your food...!!!
Will not be going back, no way !!!"}
{"text":"Je pourrais faire la même critique pour O'Burger que pour M:BRGR (dont j'ai déjà fait la critique), mais il y a deux différences : 1) la bouffe est moins bonne au O'Burger ; et 2) les serveuses sont plus belles au O' Burger. Match nul. Trois étoiles, autrement dit correct, mais rien pour s'énerver."}
{"text":"both my boyfriend and I were impressed with our burgers, but, the service was less than stellar. The waitress and waiter seemed very unhappy to be working. The ambiance was WAY too quiet and the restaurant is so narrow it's awkward. Most likely will not eat there again."}
{"text":"Be careful when you fill out the burger slips to make your own burger, I had checked off that I wanted 4 different sauces on my burger and I get served the driest burger in the world without a drip of any sauce on it."}
{"text":"Despite other reviews, I enjoyed my overall experience there! Sat outside in the nice weather, waiter was nice and the food was pretty good. The best I had but still satisfying.
Great location too!"}
{"text":"O'burger was a pretty decent burger place, as I came here for lunch with a bunch of co-workers in the past.  The place is pretty busy and finding a seat is rather difficult, so it's best to try and make reservations ahead of time if you're looking to bring a group in.  The decor is great and the place looks very modern.  I really liked the picture frames and retro style seating they have inside.

The food is pretty good and I usually get the Hawaii burger along with sweet potato fries or a poutine.  I must say the burger is your standard, and is similar to something you would get at South Street Burger or Five Guys.  The patty, seems to be previously frozen over freshly ground beef, but it tasted great regardless.  The sweet potato fries are pretty good, but I do find them to be a bit on the soggy side at times.  The poutine here is not bad as well, but compared to other poutines you can get around the city, it's sub par.

Overall a decent place to go with co-workers on a lunch, but I definitely think there are better places in Montreal for burgers."}
{"text":"Fresh burgers, i made the mistake of going at lunch time, what a line up! Other than waiting impatiently to order and get my burger I say this is not your average fast-food joint, fresh ingredients, no frozen patties. beautiful burgers.  I think the price is a little high for a burger but I guess you can't put a price on quality"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with great friends.  We were here early so we were able to snag a seat.  They had nice banquet seating with cute colour scheme in the basement.  We were nice and comfy.  The burgers were good. I had the Hawaii burger, which had a cunning mixture of blue cheese and caramelized nuts.  It worked! Who knew?  I also had it with a side of sweet potato fries.  Yummy and tender patty, which works with the thickness of the burger overall.  My friends had the salads and they really enjoyed it as well.  Personally I think it is a sin to go to a burger place and order a salad but at least they have delish options.  

When I am in Montreal and craving for burger this will be my go to place.  Close to downtown core and easily accessible."}
{"text":"Great juicy burgers
Freshly made daily
Home style fries
Toppings (lots of choices)
Often crowded, and huge lineups
But worth the wait
A bit Pricey, but also worth it"}
{"text":"When I went there it was for a very late lunch, around 1PM, if not later. I was starving and craving a burger. 

O'burger has a good selection of burgers and not just with beef. They also have salmon and chicken burgers. I'm a classic kind-of-gal when I discover a new restaurant so I opted for the O'Montreal with extra cheddar and BBQ sauce, and the O'Mix of fries. 

I feel like it took O'forever to get our plates. Maybe it was because I was O'so hungry. 

The burger was quite large. All burgers come with salad, tomatoes, onions and pickles and you can put whatever you want in it. It wasn't as dry as I had a week ago at Les 3 brasseurs, but it was alright. The patty was bigger than the bun, which is a really big plus. 

The O'mix of fries were not even. I had more sweet potato fries than regular fries, which is fine by me because the regular fries were not really good. 

As for the price, well, I didn't pay my own bill, because the waiter gave me my colleague's. She paid my bill and I paid hers. It's only after I realized that what I took didn't cost me $19. She owed me $3.50 for the difference (tips included). 

Conclusion: O'burger is O'kay. Nothing more. If I go back, I'll try a chicken burger."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, amazing burgers, good fries, will def be going back to get the Montreal smoked meat burger.  The price is a little higher than most burger joints"}
{"text":"In 3 words: Not worth it. 
The patties were store bought and the price, outlandish considering. Honestly, you may as well go across the street to the 5 Guys."}
{"text":"Disappointing

Nothing wrong with the food, it's nicely presented. I sincerely don't get the hate, I've seen worse and more expensive at other places with less criticism.

And the fries are great (pro tip Montreal: mushy fries are a no-no everywhere else)

But the service was not great. Yeah, we didn't get the condiments, ok, someone else brought them later.

Then we got a wrong check for our table (it was even for less than we had), having that fixed, their card machine didn't work properly. Yay.

Sorry, hard to recommend it."}
{"text":"We had just arrived in Montreal and were famished. After walking around for an hour, and realizing that most of the spots in the central district were overpriced and unappealing, we finally capitulated and ate here.

As others have mentioned the food was okay. The veggie burger was fine, a little burnt, but otherwise edible. The hummus topping, though seemingly an odd combo, actually alleviated the burnt taste of the burger. My boyfriend had a chicken salad which was decent, but quite costly in my opinion ($13). These two orders along with a pitcher of diluted Sangria (I kept asking \"Is there even any hooch in this?\") set us back about $50 dollars.

I doubt we will ever visit  this place again, but I suppose it is a good alternative to some of the other tourist traps in the area, and likely better because of the outdoor seating in the summer."}
{"text":"The place was ok. The burger ok. The fries ok. Not more, not less. 
A bit disappointed, but if you are downtown and need to eat in a fast and \"not really healthy\" place, I would suggest O'Burger."}
{"text":"As a foodie (sadly on a budget) I'm willing and ready to pay astronomical amounts of my cashola in order to enjoy whatever food-dragon I chase. There's no price I won't pay for the ultimate steak experience, and I won't choke on paying over 50$ for a burger, yes a burger. But the pleasure experience better have me bleeding from my eyes before I pass out.

And since the burger craze has taken over Montreal I have yet to find one of these joints that can even stand next to my expectations of what a good burger is. All they are is some business man with no knowledge of what good food is starting a stylish hipster-bait restaurant that is all about form over function. O' Burger is no different. You walk in and it's the poor-hipster's version of an ultra trendy restaurant that serves Burgers and Fries. And that's what O'Burger is doing, cashing in on a trend and it's places like O'Burger that will kill the trend.

The reception was warm and friendly as was the service, also expedient. O'Burger offers a good variety of burgers, but the template remains the same from burger to burger, that it the meat, the bun and the garden. They offer fries and Poutine of course. So I had the Dallas Burger. Typical interpretation of the Texan burger, that's Jack cheese, some Creole sauce... wait what? Creole? Yeah and it wasn't spicy, not even tangy, not even mustard tangy. Crunchy bacon? Huh, ehhhh, where? Cus I didn't have any bacon in mine. Caramelized onions my ass. The bun was the hit. Most trendy burger joint have dried crackly buns but here it's soft and moist. 

The meat... is epic facepalm worthy. This patty had nothing resembling fresh or hand prepared. It's the same patty I see in every hipster burger joint. Barely had a beefy taste because of all the filler compacted into a flower shaped patty. This patty was produced by a machine in a factory somewhere, where it was flash frozen. 

How about that poutine? How about more frozen foods? There's no way those were fresh cut and they tasted even synthetic, so who knows what chemical treatment they endured at the plant. No amount of gravy, cheese, bacon and those ridiculous caramelized onion could hide the horrible taste of those fries. Gravy wasn't even good.

In my book if I don't need at least 3 or 4 napkins to eat a burger, then it's not a good burger. Sure it was pretty but it was bad, so bad a Big Mac would have been a better option. If your restaurant is named O' Burger shouldn't your burger blow people away? I'd prefer having my greasy burger at La Belle Province than eat that bland boring piece of crap I was served. 

How hard is it to go to a butcher, get your chuck FRESH and make the patties as you go? How hard is it to hand cut fries and fry them in good oil? Well it doesn't matter to the owner, he just wants to cash in on the trend and when O' Burger crashes with the trend, he'll open another restaurant cashing in on the current trend of that day. It's not a passion for food; it's a passion for profit.

O'Burger how thou sucketh. It's no wonder I was the only patron in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Un réel plaisir que d'avoir trouvé cet endroit en plein coeur de downtown Montréal !

Je me suis retrouvée ici un midi, une chaude journée de fin de printemps, sans réservation.  Une table pour deux nous a été donnée assez rapidement (5-10 minutes) considérant que la terrasse était plein à craquer.

J'ai commandé le burger Dallas avec un à-côté de frites mixtes (patates sucrées et patates jaunes) avec un si rafraichissant Coke (bon, ok, je ne fais pas de pub pour Coca-Cola... c'est que j'en suis accro !!).  Mm mm mm, dé-li-ci-eux !  

J'avais évidemment lu le review de Dave I. (http://bit.ly/OBurgerDaveI) et j'appréhendais le pire, i.e. : un burger qui goûte le carton et des frites McCain.  Pour avoir déjà été au O'Burger de DDO (boul. Saint-Jean), je connaissais un peu le concept - soit un hybride entre le burger customizé et un fast food.

Conclusion : j'ai effectivement été agréablement surprise.  J'ai bien aimé mon burger !  Comme Dave, j'ai beaucoup aimé le pain (très frais et différent de l'habituel).  Par contre, j'ai aussi aimé ma boulette de viande ; elle n'avait peut-être pas l'apparence d'une homemade, mais elle était juteuse (pas dégoulinante) et bien assaisonnée.  J'ai aussi vraiment été ravie de mes frites \"O'Mix\" ; pour la première ai-je vraiment aimé les frites de patates douces.  Elles étaient légères et croustillantes.  Idem pour les frites régulières.  

Du fait que j'y suis allée sur l'heure du lunch, je crois qu'il en vaille la peine de souligner que de luncher assis et se faire servir dans un resto (dehors sur une belle terrasse aux soleil, en plus !), être bien servi et bien manger, tout ça pour moins de 20 $ (taxes et tip inclus), cela se fait plutôt rare ces temps-ci... et cela m'a bien plus ici !

Les seuls deux petits points plutôt négatifs de cette première visite (et certainement pas la dernière) chez O'Burger sur McGill sont ceux-ci : A) le manque de sauce dans mon sandwich (quoique cela laissait toute la place au goût de la boulette) et B) l'oubli de nous apporter la facture à la fin ce qui nous a retardés de 15 minutes (mais bon, ceci est forcément dû au fait que le resto roulait à plus que pleine capacité... je ne m'en plaindrai pas plus qu'il faut pour l'instant puisque cela m'a permis de profiter d'un peu plus de soleil sur mon heure de lunch).

O'Burger, je te donne un 4 étoiles.  À bientôt, en espérant être aussi ravie que cette fois-ci ! ;-)"}
{"text":"I'm always a sucker for new 'gourmet' burger joints and was pleased to see that O'Burger opened recently in my neighbourhood. Knowing that it is in the West's tallest office building ~The Bow, I was not going anywhere near there at lunchtime. 

Today I went at 2 pm, there was no crowd and only one customer in line. I placed my order and sat down to wait. The counter person packed up an order and proceeded to give it to the woman ahead of me (Customer #2) who left the restaurant, I wait approximately 3 minutes and the counter person wraps another order which I assume is mine, she looks at my receipt and says no, another customer (#1) gets up and says he's waiting but that's not his order. Counter person has mixed up #1 and #2, apologizes and tells #1 they will remake his order and it will be 5 minutes. 
...wait another 2 minutes and CP wraps up another order, nope! not mine! It's #1! they took my burger and flipped the burger to fill his botched order! So not only did they botch #1 & #2, I ended up getting extra time to make up for their mistake! Definitely will NOT go there if there's a hint of a line up or I have to be anywhere in a hurry. 

That being said, the burger was good, 7/10 and the fries 6/10."}
{"text":"Tried the Bombay Veggie Burger and was delicious. Service was very fast around 12:00.
Very good value for its taste."}
{"text":"Great tasty burger for a reasonable price. The patties are well sized, it's pretty hefty. The only thing I didn't like about it was that my bun was a little dry, but the rest of the burger makes up for it. Many of their add ons are free like caramelized onions, hot banana peppers, and sautéed mushrooms. I also ordered a poutine which was decent; lots of cheese curds and plenty of gravy.
The wait time wasn't bad at all, and while you do wait, you get to see where they weigh/prepare all the burgers. The employees are quite friendly and its a welcoming environment. I would recommend to try it out one day"}
