{"text":"I go to the farmers market and see the place and I tell myself I need to go in there it looks interesting.  Well now I never will and hope you won't either.  I was out for breakfast at another restaurant on Christmas day. Bless them for being open since we were traveling from place to place that day. This place was packed to the point the kitchen got backed up.  So they had to hold the seating for awhile the manager kept coming out and with a very Christmas spirit and say ,\" MERRY CHRISTMAS sorry folks we are doing our best and will have you seat as soon as possible \" the third time she came out you could see she was worried about us but still in good spirits when all of the sudden this man and woman starts to yell at her say they own wildberry and thus is unacceptable. I lived her response \"are you open on Christmas day\" \"NO\" he said she answered back \"MERRY Christmas\" I work in customer service and I treat people with respect and give understanding to those that do also especially those working holidays if this is how they treat people in public I would not eat here."}
{"text":"Wild Berry Diner is the BEST!!  The food is amazing, the prices are good, it's family oriented and just feels like home.  I'm going to try to add a picture iof the owner George taking my grandson with him to seat people and give them menus.  George asked James if he wanted to work with him and of course he did!!  He even gave him money afterwards.  This is not the first time George has made my grandson feel special and we always feel like family!!!"}
{"text":"I took my 80 year old mother there for dinner one Friday evening. The waitress is friendly but however the food wasn't very good. Service was slow, mashed potatoes were horrible, mixed vegetables were over steaming mushy. The fried chicken was overcooked and hard. Ordered a small mixed berry pie for dessert the crust and apparently SAT around all day cross was hard to cut and berries in the syrup or very runny. A dinner for two people went $34 I had better food at chilis for less money. The old woman at the cash register was rude grumpy, I'll never go back there again and I advise my friends do the same."}
{"text":"I hope that people that go to your restaurant don't treat you the way you treat staff at other restaurants going into places and yelling how you own wild berry and berating the staff at the place you are in good advertisement now you lost customers"}
{"text":"Very thoughtful owners and staff.  Big time snowbird hangout but the food is good, big portions, and affordable."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Service was outstanding.  One of my favorite things is the owner walks the group to the table but holds the hand of one of the ladies in the group. It's quite adorable. The food was great! Would come back here again!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Senior menu very limited for choices , no half orders of oatmeal.  Regular menu portions are huge and they don't let you split a meal. The Berry Cakes are plain (box mix tasting) pancakes...don't include berries & one has to pay $1.99 for very small amount of berries on top.  Coffee was good. Wouldn't recommend taking Senior here and if you're a small eater, plan in getting a take home box"}
{"text":"George is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We eat here all the time NEVER had bad food or bad service. The staff is great, friendly, and very patient. The food is always large portions (we share a lot), delicious, and looks appealing. It's a keeper in the \"go to\" place for us."}
{"text":"Going to this restaurant was a life changing experience. The owner is one of the nicest people I have ever came across. He was extremely nice to my friend's daughter, I didn't realize people like this still exist. The service was amazing and the food was delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. This restaurant renewed my faith in human kind. This is a prime example of when you're inspired by someone to pay it forward."}
{"text":"This diner obviously takes a lot of pride in what they're doing. The staff was exceptionally hospitable and made you feel welcome. It definitely has a small, home town feel to it. The biscuits were as big as my face and the portions are huge, while the price tag is not. My coffee cup never ran dry. I'll definitely return for some good comfort food! Well done :)"}
{"text":"We love eating breakfast here. It's a great value and the staff treats you like family."}
{"text":"Got 2 orders of catfish. Not as good as we hoped for. Heavily breaded and very heavy. Not what we were expecting at all. The pie was ok."}
{"text":"First time her and I knew as soon as I walked in I would be back.  Very friendly,  exceptional service, family owned.  Great food!  Great prices!"}
{"text":"I've been to this cafe a couple of times now, and I always feel welcome from the moment I walk in the door. The food is amazing, especially for the price! Good, home cooked meals, friendly staff (the owner makes you feel like family), and low prices are a great combo! Excellent choice of you're looking to eat out on a budget. Just remember to properly tip your server!"}
{"text":"Wow.  What a great omelete (had the Gyro omelete).  Delicious coffee and attentive service.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this diner more than 5 stars!  My hub and I love to go to breakfast on Saturdays but we have not been able to find a really great local place in the 3 years we've lived in Mesa.  A coworker of my husband recommended Wild Berry.  I like to have \"real diner food\" if I go to a diner, esp corned beef hash and eggs.  I was served CBH, perfectly poached eggs, and crisp, ungreasy has browns.  Couldn't eat it all, even though I really tried.  Oh, it also came with a big, fluffy biscuit.  I would come here just for the biscuit!  Husband loves good chicken fried steak.  After 10 years in Texas, he knows his CFS and loved the one here at Wild Berry.  I usually try to bring a Starbucks with me but didn't this time.  Didn't need to because the coffee was very good.  Diner was clean and bright, service was amazing.  Owner watches over everything and has a wonderful sense of humor.  Go there!!!!"}
{"text":"Great home cooking kind of a dive but really great people and service  The lunch specials are the bomb The Greek owner is a fun character and always fun to visit with Give this place a try you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"As much as we like breakfast and lunch at Wild Berry Diner their fish and chips are awful. Crust is really bad.  Scrap off the crust then the fish is eatable."}
{"text":"Feels like home! The owner is super friendly! He took my wife by the hand and led us to the table to seat us. The restaurant has older furnishings, but is clean. The staff is friendly. The food is good and not overpriced. No cucumber infused water or $6 nonsense coffee here. Just the basics, and all done very well. Two adults can eat here for $20 with drinks. Happy we stumbled across this place."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Good food, large portions, reasonable prices.  Everyone who works here is so friendly and remembers you when you come.  That is worth so much.  George, the owner, is a great guy who is always so kind to our disabled daughter.  He always makes her feel special.  You can't go wrong visiting here, oh and they serve breakfast all day.  Aunt Sara's omelet is my favorite."}
{"text":"Well this is a home run from the start. We showed up around 9am and got seated with in 5 minutes. The owner holds every lady's hand and shows them to there seats. The staff is just great and very attending to there tables. The food was just great. I had the chicken fried steak and my girlfriend had crabby George Benedict and it was hot good and fresh. The prices are reasonable and the food selection is very good . We will be back."}
{"text":"We found this place just driving down Main and hungry.  The wait staff was friendly, the breakfast selections were yummy, and the portions were generous.  There seemed to be a lot of regulars there too.  We were very pleased."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this place for 3 years - each year we hold our breath that it will be as good as last year.  So far, so good.   Nothing elaborate, just good basic comfort food with a friendly staff and friendly owner.   We love breakfast here and keep coming back.   And the prices are good.   Highly recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Perfect diner and perfect diner food. I am quite the diner person. We have visited many diners in over 20 states and this diner stands out for many reasons: Pancakes with a donut texture, light biscuits, classic peppery white gravy, potatoes that are lightly flavored, bacon to make your mouth water and nicely cooked eggs (nothing worse than over cooked eggs)! I highly recommend Wild Berry Cafe! And a good cup of coffee and classic friendly atmosphere and super attentive staff means that you should eat here."}
{"text":"I have been here before and the food was good but this last visit....The servers are really nice but the last time I went there the catfish tasted off and the turkey was literally grey on the ends.  Gross"}
{"text":"Delicious home cooking and a hospitable staff. This was a gem for breakfast on our Phoenix/Mesa visit! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was craving a home-cooked meal without the hassle. More importantly, something fried with mashed potatoes. You know good ol' comfort food. Since this place is so close to my house, I decided to give it a whirl and get some take out.  Parked right up front, noticed a sign stating parking for greeks only. Hopefully they were joking because I am not. Lol.   Walked in and took all the old building appeal and chotskis in. What I am assuming was one owners, greeted me and pulled their tall special board over for me to review along with handling me a menu. He suggested the gyro sandwich, I should have listened. Instead I was swayed to order their fish and chip special. The fish pieces, not filets, were good, but not great. The peas were a bit mushy and the mashed potatoes were smooth and just ok. They were covered in brown gravy, which I did not care for. The dinners come with a choice of soup or salad. I got the soup, which was clam chowder. That too tasted not to my liking. It was thick and had a werid taste about it. Last in final item was their delightful homemade cram pies. The crust on the top was somewhat flakey, but once i cut into the pie the bottom of the crust had disiintergrated into chocolate cream. I tasted it was watery and flavorless.   I don't understand. I had high hopes for this place from the reviews, but perhaps since the place was closing at 8:30 and the rush had just ended then that's why things were off. The staff was nice and they had an A rating from Maricopa Health Department. I may go back, but maybe for breakfast as everyone recommends. I am sad because my craving for comfort food was not fulfilled. On to the next restaurant..."}
{"text":"Great Find!  I was stranded in Mesa during a car repair.  The shop recommended this place and they were spot on!  This is a no frills, home style diner.  The staff is very diverse and everyone is making a living and trying to have some fun at the same time!"}
{"text":"Lots of choices even Italian and Greek, a variety of fish dishes. George is a hoot and our food was hot and served in a timely manner, services was a bit slow to start, but its in how you finish. My mom liked it and that's what matters, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Drove out of our way to try this and it was great.   Fantastic staff and food.  French toast was thick and delicious.  Have the red potato hashbrowns AMAZING"}
{"text":"Coffee tasted burnt, kids did not like the pancakes at all, and bacon tasted funny. Service was great, and personable. Was really hoping to like this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really did. I love the name of the place.  I had a girlfriend in town and we selected this place to have breakfast and catch up. The place wasn't much in the ambiance department. It seemed kind of .....tired.  Anyway we ordered and we both ordered the Belgium Waffles. In the meantime they brought coffee which was not bad. The waffles came and I happen to like my waffles crisp. They weren't. We also ordered them with blueberries and strawberries. OK.....but they served those in what seemed to be maple syrup. I'm not a fan of maple syrup, so that didn't work for me. So sorry to say......I can make better waffles at home. I will say they kept the coffee flowing which was a good thing.  Perhaps there are tastier things on the menu and we just ordered the wrong thing. So needless to say......I won't be going back anytime soon.  PK"}
{"text":"This is about the only place in Mesa that has \"diner\" food and it is delicious.  It is Greek owned and has many Greek dishes.  If you want some delicious soup or a full meal, this is the place and prices are reasonable.  They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner all day until closing time. Owners are delightful and pay personal attention to each customer.  The place is very clean and seating is very comfortable."}
{"text":"The food is good and the staff is very nice, but don't eat the toast!  I sat and watched the servers handle money, menus and cleaning towels then rummage through a plate of toast at the pick up window to finish their orders.  They didn't think twice about handling the food without washing their hands.  I was so disappointed because the bread is amazing.  I mentioned it to our server and she quickly told the other ladies to put some gloves on, and she had fresh toast made for me and my husband.  Probably won't go back there again.  Sorry!  Nice people."}
{"text":"This restaurant was horrible! The floor is filthy they drag a huge specials board around the restaurant to each person that comes in. A man there,  must be the owner, is loud and the food was very bad. They actually serve veg-all that comes from a can as part of a dinner. The brown gravy was like a gel and it tasted horrible! I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place of all time ! Staff is so sweet ,caring, and fast. Restaurant is cute ,homey, clean. They are very fast about cleaning tables. Food takes slightly longer than most chain restaurants but it's for all the extra love ! The food is as close to breakfast come cooking as you'll get without the mess."}
{"text":"Love this place. Second time there, the food was outstanding and Vicky was a great server.  Will try lunch sometime but if it is anything like breakfast it will be great."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new breakfast place, so we decided to try this place out. I'm so glad we did! Interior looks a bit dated BUT it is CLEAN! All the wait staff was so nice, coffee was never half empty and the food was yummy! Great little diner with a nice family feel. Price was on point for the food they served plus it was quick. Seems like this is a place that the locals all frequent because everyone knew each other. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great simple food at an affordable price!! Friendly staff, family owned I highly  recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"My wife, kid and I on a whim embarked on a trip to Mesa for V-Day. Knowing well that most of the restaurants at Superstition Springs would be booked to the hilt for dinner, we ventured down Main Street instead and found this gem.  They welcomed us with open arms, and fawned over our little girl. Although we had never been in this restaurant in our lives, we instantly felt treated like family when we walked in the door..   Not only that, they had a live accordion! It was a ton of fun."}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is hot, fresh and there is plenty of it! Free cup of soup with lunch order. Servers are all awesome and efficient ."}
{"text":"Nice local diner. Serves breakfast all day, which is what we had. Nice sized portions. The link sausages are much larger than normal restaurants serve.  Served mixture of Italian and Greek style dishes.  (My price vote is for breakfast. didn't look at the lunch/supper prices.)"}
{"text":"We just went here for lunch and were not impressed.  My BFF got the Beef Au Jou sandwich and it looked like cheese stuffed in beef.  The cheese wasn't even melted..  I had the Grilled Cheese and, although, the place advertises 'Good Home Cooking', I could have cooked my sandwich better at my home. The server was friendly but they never checked on us except when we waved and I sent the check back to have them total it. Sorry, but we won't be returning any time soon, if at all."}
{"text":"This is a standard diner type place. The owner (older greek gentleman) took me by the hand to my table.  i did not care for that personally, but I'm not a touchy feely person.  I ordered french toast & it was really good!  My husband had a burger & said it was good.  I would come here again for breakfast."}
{"text":"YO, this was the weirdest and most uncomfortable eating experience OF MY LIFE. I'm not even ten seconds in the door and the restaurant manager makes a comment about how my boyfriend looks like he doesn't have any money and then he proceeds to GRAB MY HAND and LEAD ME to our table. So completely unprofessional and unwarranted! He lingered by our table and the table next to ours and made the whole experience awkward. The food was mediocre - the steak was fatty, the eggs were undercooked. Even if the food was awesome I would not come here again because of the manager. Everyone around seemed to blow it off but this was the most wildly unprofessional, awkward and invasive experience I've ever had and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Looks like a really old Denny's building.  70's decorating.  Not the cleanest place but by no means dirty.   It feels down home, cozy and inviting to me, exactly the way a family run diner should be.     Now, we went there with our daughter.  She got the child's pancake with bacon.  It was HUGE and perfectly cooked.  We got the veggie omlet and chicken fried steak with biscuit sides.  Biscuits were the size of an NFL players hands, fluffy and very good.  Chicken fried steak was one of the best Ive ever had.  Will say the hashbrowns were a little undercooked and the omlet had a bit to much onion and short other stuff.  I'm nitpicking on those last two. Did I mention breakfast was huge.  No leaving hungry here.  Total bill with 20% tip, drinks and tax for the 3 of us was $34.  Can't beat that  Overall it's one of the best dinners around, atleast for breakfast. We will be back!!!  Definaltely."}
{"text":"Wild Berry is a great place for breakfasts. I've gone here for years and have never had a bad meal. It's popular with the older crowd because of its location, and popular with families because of its friendly owners and employees. George, one of the owners, is very kind and great with the kids. There is often a special surprise on holidays like Easter or Mothers Day."}
{"text":"A very cute place.  You can tell the food is home cooked and they give you a lot for your money, very reasonable pricing. Only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is because the building is definitely dated and could use some updating, it was sort of musky while we were there. Food and service are 5 star though."}
{"text":"I love this place! So good and amazing service and staff! The manager is very nice and takes you by the hand to your table. My son loves coming here the manager takes him to the front bar and he helps him make a hot chocolate with whip cream."}
{"text":"I found this diner on yelp and came here twice for breakfast while in town on a cross country motorcycle trip. The first time I came, I wanted to try their eggs Benedict, but was informed they only offer them on the weekends. All was not lost, I found another menu option I thoroughly enjoyed.   I returned on the weekend to give one of their Benedicts a try, which I had been eyeballing on yelp, and it was outstanding.   Both times the service was very friendly, courteous, and attentive. This is about as close as you can get to the feel of a traditional diner, which are only found in Jersey, without going to Jersey.   I highly recommend giving this a place a try if you have not yet."}
{"text":"Great fare on the menu. One thing I enjoy is having the option of ordering breakfast all day. I would recommend the gyro omelette. Good home cooking is how I would describe the cuisine. Great atmosphere for family. The owner is very generous and compassionate with children."}
{"text":"Was looking for a diner in which my girlfriend and I could refuel after the Mesa Sprint Triathlon and this fit the bill.  It starts when the male host hands me the menus and says I'll carry those and grabs my girlfriend's hand and leads us to our table.  When my parents arrive he inquires my mother's name and then does the same with them, pretty comical.    I ordered the Southern Benedict, and man was it good.  I'm going back for the biscuits though...that thing was massive.  The waitress was pretty funny as well, had some witty comments.  Definitely coming back sometime."}
{"text":"They have great service here and everyone is so friendly.  I had the chicken souvlaki over rice pilaf and greek salad it was delicious.  Hubby had pork chops mashed potatoes mixed vegetables and a salad. We both walk away full and happy"}
{"text":"Simply amazing!! Such a cute and comfortable diner makes me feel like I am back home in my small town! The food was really delicious and very large portion size! My boyfriend eats a ton and this place filled him up, also inexpensive. Although it's not a place you would drive by and think we should eat there it's definitely a hidden gem! Will be returning here! They serve breakfast all day and have homemade biscuits! Yuuum!!"}
{"text":"we had breakfast here yesterday the service was good ,the place it self is old school decor early american  and could use a good cleaning, I had two eggs over medium w/hashbrowns that really had no umpf  Im not sure if they were from a bag but i have a feeling they were and a slice of bone in ham the size of texas ......delicious my wife had two eggs over soft and when they came they were over HARD ???? the wait person apoligized and brought her 2 eggs over soft in a timley fashion.greeks are usually known for running great breakfast joints but this bunch have been catering to the old school mesa crowd to long."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Excellent service!!! My daughter (18months) and I went to breakfast there this morning and everyone that knows the attention span of a toddler knows how challenging it may be when dining out! But we had the best experience this morning! Very nice and friendly waitress!! Food came out super fast! And was so delicious! I had the French toast deluxe and my daughter had the kids pancakes! Jimmy came out and said hi and was super friendly and kind! As my daughter started loosing her patience, George came to our table and was so sweet and kind to my baby! He even shared some of her pancakes!! She thought it was so funny! Great food, great prices, great service, great atmosphere!!! I'm just so happy we live close!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch with some coworkers around 11am and there was plenty of seating and great service. You're able to order breakfast or lunch and they give you a free \"soup of the day\" with your lunch entrée! We were all given the lentil and bean and couldn't be more pleased. I ordered the BLT on toasted bread with a side of fries. I really wish they served avocado, but it's not an option they offer. The fries weren't my favorite so I'd choose a different side, but not a deal breaker. My meal cost me about $10 with a drink included so it's definitely priced right."}
{"text":"The staff here is super friendly, the food is marvelous (and such huge portions), and the menu features a wide variety of dishes from various places in the world. The dessert case is full of really good stuff that's all made fresh! The price is hard to beat, too. Today I went here for breakfast and got a plate bigger than my head full of yummy food for just $4.99. For two people the bill was only about $10."}
{"text":"I drive by the wild berry diner all the time , finally decided to stop for breakfast this morning . I told my wife that I would be the guinea pig . Well I am very glad that I stopped in for breakfast . The staff is very nice and courteous . The biscuits and gravy is delicious . I had the French toast plus and it was great . I will definitely bring my wife and kids for breakfast real soon . Great atmosphere , not noisy , easy parking . Can't wait to bring my family and friends to eat breakfast here ! Thanks Wild Berry Diner !"}
{"text":"YOU MUST TRY THIS WONDERFUL PLACE!!! I can't say enough great things about this place but here goes... Great friendly service and staff! Food is crazy delicious! Portions are large and very filling. This is a great place to bring family, lots of options, breakfast served all day. Kids meals are on the bigger side which i love because my kiddos actually got full for $2.99!!! We cant wait to bring family in from out of town so they can be impressed!"}
{"text":"Went with the hubby's family for his bday for breakfast.  Found this place on yelp!   Service is true diner friendly, portions are huge, prices seem good.  My daughter and hubby split the greek omelet and I had a bite, then wished I had gotten that instead of my eggs benedict.  Mine were okay, there was nothing wrong with them, just weren't the best I have ever had.  They could also use a better credit terminal/computer system."}
{"text":"This place is awesome; we have had breakfast and dinner there and have never been diss appointed ."}
{"text":"Nice little diner type place with good food for the price with huge portions. They have lots of daily specials which is nice for variety."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! We were seated quickly, the owner was so funny and welcoming. The service was on point! Our drinks stayed full the whole time (great coffee!) The food came right out warm, delicious and neatly served! Such great portion with a very reasonable price! And the pies... the pies are definitely the best! I highly recommend this local jewel!"}
{"text":"The words \"Great Service\" comes to mind when the Manager/Owner takes my wife's hand and walks her to her seat then pulls her chair out for her!! Awesome very friendly staff. The food was really good. With a surprising homemade sausage patties with my biscuits and gravy!! I would diffinately recommend the Ralph's Southern Breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident but great food and outstanding servers!  Well worth the drive here!"}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and good. Like one of thse cool old diners they filmed swingers at"}
{"text":"Also, They have FishFry on Fridays, and it's awesome.  Starts at 4pm, I think? So get there early because they get busy on Fridays.  Also, Clam Chowder on Fridays. HUGE breakfast portions. But they also have smaller size portions under \"lighter side\" on menu. They also have a senior menu. But really thier prices are pretty low already. Wild berry's phone number wasn't listed on Google, so I added it.  So call them with any questions,  large table reservations, or Togo orders."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 5 Star. This is a wonderful place to eat. Ok, it's a family restaurant. There are lots of them around. Denny's, the Village, Perkins. The difference is the menu is a little different, and De-lisious! It's family owned. A Greek family that is about 4 generations at Wild Berry. They all work there. Like most Greeks , extremely friendly. They like to have fun with their customers. They like to tease a little. There is always plenty of laughter. The servers are friendly and abundant. On our last trip for lunch there was a complimentary soup. When was the last time that happened? Great food,great atmosphere, you feel part of the family. It was a little slow paying our check because people were taking selfies with the owner and his dad. They were working the register."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for dinner and it was awesome. The service was excellent and the staff made you feel at home. I had the Chicken Slovakia and it was perfect. Definitely  we will be a regular here."}
{"text":"A wonderful mom and pop type diner whose owners are Greek in origin.   My family and I ate here three times within our 10 day trip to Arizona. The portions are more than generous and the prices are very reasonable. The service was wonderful and the waitress remembered my daughters favorite meal there (super picky kid). One of the owners George was so wonderful and was seen leading guest by the hand to their table.  George is obviously loved by many as there are a lot of children's artwork hanging as you walk in given to him.  It's not often that you find a restaurant like this and I wish there was one near where we lived in Pennsylvania."}
{"text":"The food was OK. Our waitress left much to be desired. We ordered pancakes that never made it to the table. I also asked for jelly and it never made it to the table. Extremely poor service. We will not be visiting this diner again."}
{"text":"Typical greasy spoon type of diner, I had the ham and eggs, everything was under seasoned and kind of bland, three stars because of the great service and atmosphere very home town kind of feel. Just the food as you would expect may cater to an older crowd."}
{"text":"Was not able to do a check in because I am a little behind on my reviews. Trying new places and had lunch here with Valerie Ward. It is run by a Greek family. The menu is huge!  This made it hard to pick because everything looked delicious. I always gravitate towards Greek because I LOVE feta cheese. I had the Greek burger which was topped with feta, had two slices of crisp fresh tomatoes, sliced white onion and lettuce on the side. No need for salt or pepper or even a single condiment. I substituted onion rings. Fresh made and delicious. The burger was 1/2 pound grilled and juicy, well seasoned. Valerie had the cheeseburger and she also said hers was fantastic. Price was good and service super fast. Their dessert display makes one's head snap back. Bread pudding at least 6 inches high. Individual pies also looked wonderful. Had no room that day but would go for coffee and maybe share a bread pudding!  Definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"Great food, love their Senior Menu items their bacon waffles are not to be missed the Ham Steak is unbelievable the servers are very attentive and George makes every visit a memory. If you do not give it a try you are missing out."}
{"text":"Good home cooked breakfasts, I had the Southern Benedict, comes with home made sausage patties, eggs, smothered in sausage gravy.. and hashbrown as a side! Can't get better than this for $7.99..YUMMY  They have a board that they turn around for you when you sit down with all the daily specials, they always have a good variety of them.  OK one thing EVERYONE has to try is thier bread pudding with a vanilla cream sauce.. OMG I thought I died and went to bread puddin heaven!  I really like that most everything you have there is made fresh... usually the owner is the one cooking or getting after the staff to get food served quickly.  Nice family owned place, its a place everyone can go to for a good meal!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here the other day with the fam, great selection and to my delight, many items had a Greek twist to them.  On top of the food being tasty, you can easily share with a spouse, friend, relative or foe as the portions are huge!  I will definitely be back soon with friends."}
{"text":"Great service..the owner noticed my 4 year old daughter was carrying a purse with nothing but a stuffed bunny inside so he gave her $10 to put in her purse to go shopping..we have been here before and always get great service and the biscuits are amazing. They are also very accommodating for someone on a diet! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. 5 people in our party and everyone thought it was SUB-PAR food. Its like they aren't trying anymore.  Would be a great place for the show RESTAURANT IMPOSABLE  to visit. Service was outstanding, the waitress took care of our every need and was always there asking if she could get us anything. I had the meat loaf dinner, their was two pieces of the thinnest meat loaf I have ever had in my lifetime. The gravy was very salty. My wife couldn't even eat her meal, she order the pork dinner. She said it was tolerable. One of our party ordered French dressing for her salad, she said it tasted like plain old Ketchup.  Maybe we hit them on a bad night. Maybe will try them for breakfast and give them the benefit of the doubt.   I hope they do better."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Wild Berry Diner but it definitely won't be my last. We stopped in for a late breakfast. The host, who we later figured out was the owner, sat us down and brought water and coffee. I ordered the country fried steak and my girlfriend had the espanola omelette. Both dishes came out quickly and were amazing. The country fried steak was crispy and topped with a delicious gravy. It was served with scrambled eggs, a biscuit and crispy hash browns. The omelette was full of flavor and topped with a zesty salsa. The owner came out to make sure the food was good and made conversation. He was very friendly and made the experience pleasant. The meal was great, the service was great and we were ready to head out. We asked the waitress for the check and she explained that the owner had taken care of it after finding out I'm in the Army. If you want to support a patriotic, family-owned restaurant that serves delicious breakfast dishes, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out years ago but had already eaten elsewhere so I didn't have a meal. I always wanted to come back. I was accompanying my neighbor to have some X-rays done and we went here on my recommendation for lunch. Great choice!   She got a roast beef sandwich, Midwestern Style,  covered in brown gravy. I got Roast Pork off the specials board with mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and vegetables. The pork was very tender and delicious and they gave me a good amount. The mashed potatoes were super smooth like they might have been made from a mix but had decent flavor. If they were home made they must have pureed the heck out of them to make them that smooth. The vegetables were your usual Diner vegetables, peas and carrots on the mushy side. There was pita bread on the side and it had great flavor and texture. That made me wonder if their Greek food might be good since they know how to do the pita bread right. I also had a cup of soup with dinner that was definitely homemade split pea soup, some of the best I've ever eaten.   The service was perfect, just enough attention and water refills without feeling hovered over. I felt that we had a great meal for a good price. I couldn't finish it and brought some home that I had for dinner.   I had no room for dessert. I'd love to go back there and maybe just get dessert and coffee sometime so I could enjoy the dessert and not be too full for it.   I give this place an A plus and look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"A nice locally owned family diner with some American and Americanized Greek cuisine .  Honest value for your money , the portions are huge , they have great cobbler pies . When I say great, it really is the crust is flaky and wonderful!   But please, please, please do away with that awful tasting and over salted brown gravy that gets \"dumped\" on everything!  It is gross!   And season your vegetables a bit, and I don't mean with salt .  The service is always prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"The family had breakfast here and let's just say the little guy(1 yr) ate almost the entire Mickey mouse pancake! Excellent service too!! We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Pleasantly suprised.  Its a small homey diner with decent food at a good price.    I had the turkey melt with fries and it was good.  Hubby had the biscuits and gravy and it was good as well.  Huge portion of hashbrowns and it was a half order.  I was indeed pleasantly suprised and we will come back."}
{"text":"Walking inside it is evident that this restaurant caters too and is favored by senior citizens. Unfortunately the food reflects this. Although they offer a varied menu, none of the dishes are prepared quite right as far as flavor is concerned. For example they choose to batter their fish in a thick tasteless breading instead of a light egg batter. I would not say the food is awful but just adequate to suppress hunger without leaving a lasting impression or satisfaction. I must say that the service was great and the food came out fast. I would recommend the restaurant for breakfast only which is served all day."}
{"text":"Took my brother and nephew here for the first time and they really enjoyed their meals. Brother chose the tilapia dinner and chose the salad and nephew ordered the gyro platter and he chose the soup. Both said they would come back. Nice portions for some hungry men. I had one of their specials the stuffed cabbage and salad. I had to take half of my meal home. Tasted like Grandmas homemade dinner. Really great place stop in and try it. Oh and I really like that they serve breakfast all day."}
{"text":"The breakfast go to place in east Mesa large platters never ending coffee great service George and company make you feel like part of the family"}
{"text":"This place is BERRY good.  George is very cordial as are all the staff.   We enjoyed GREAT meals.  We will definitely go back.  TRY It you'll like it."}
{"text":"While in Mesa looking for variety to please all. Nice diner with great staff. Many daily specials to choose from. We were offered a small cup of lentil soup on the house and it was very good. We ordered three different types of food and they were all delicious. Keeping this one bookmarked."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Biscuits are huge and delicious. Want to go back and try some more."}
{"text":"We ate here on Mother's Day. We were greeted at the door by a very nice man. The service was excellent. The food was fabulous. We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a fun Mesa Diner. It is a Greek Diner and everything that comes with it.   One thing that was a little weird was the proprietor grabbed my wife by the hand and led us to our table. Never had that happen before, and was a little off putting.   The food was solid diner fare. My wife got a bbq sandwich that was chopped and had lots of fat in it, and her browns weren't that crispy. Our amazing waitress, Maureen, happily replaced my wife's order to her liking, and took terrific care of us.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went here looking forward to a good breakfast, but rather than being able to enjoy my breakfast here as a single person... I was told I would be sitting with another single person, an older man. I wasnt really given a choice about it, nor did I fully understand, as they were making jokes and laughing about it, what they were doing until they took us to a table to share. I have no doubt that the old man was as sweet as pie! But, I came in there to enjoy my breakfast, not to enjoy someone else's company, especially someone I don't even know. The old man said this is always what they do on weekends because that way they don't lose business. I left. I was disgusted that as a single person I was treated this way, that the owner who seated us felt this was acceptable, and mortified that they felt it was acceptable to treat singles this way. I would never go there again after that experience, no matter how good people say the food may or may not be...."}
{"text":"Great food, love their Senior Menu items, the servers are very attentive and George makes every visit a memory. If you do not give it a try you are missing out."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for biscuits and gravy. My husband suggested Wild Berry Diner. We stopped in on a Sunday Morning for breakfast. It was still pretty early and it wasn't all that busy. The daily specials are listed on a board as soon as you walk in, and they also have a separate menu with the specials as well. I really didn't have to look at the menu as I knew what I wanted. The biscuits and gravy comes in either a half order or full order. I opted for the half order, good thing I did because holy cow it was huge. The food came out rather quickly, and I dive into my biscuit and gravy. I was not impressed with the gravy, it lacked seasonings. I had to add salt and pepper. The biscuit was good, however.  The restaurant itself is clean and the waitstaff it attentive and friendly. Prices are cheap. I will be back to try the fish fry."}
{"text":"Often go here for breakfast and always efficient friendly service, hot coffee refills, and really good food! Nice variety of items, well prepared, ample quantity and really good home cooking. The diner is clean and the booths comfortable. It's a staple for family and friends.     I've also been here for lunch and same dependable and enjoyable quality."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and efficient. Our breakfast was ok.  Think I might have been more impressed if I had tried the huge roll in the pastry display case. Coffee was hot and I didn't have to drown it with cream to be drinkable. Everything was ok, Not much more I can say."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMM is all I can say. I am VERY picky when it come to breakfast & restaurants who try to serve you hot cakes for a million bucks. This place was so good, great prices & funny staff. Would for sure go back."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Really good menu and more than reasonable prices.  Lots of traffic from snowbirds, but the service has always been excellent.  They have an excellent desert offering.  Great fish fry on Friday."}
{"text":"You are greeted like you are an old friend.  The food is great, service is fast, iced tea is cold, and it doesn't kill your wallet."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over 12 years, and on a regular basis,  long story short, I went yesterday, (bad)  but felt it's a holiday they will do better) wrong! nobody in the place, and it was a nightmare, I am never stepping int that place again!   My family memeber said that years ago, and didn't, just started going back, in the last 4 years or so more bad things than good, two days in a row, Strike 300 Your out!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast food and especially loved the warm welcome of being led to my seat by the hand.  Already been back 2x in a week for breakfast."}
{"text":"There are different themes for different food items on varying nights of the week.  We stopped at Wild Berry Diner on \"Greek\" night.  Thus, if you order from the specials board, you may just end up with a Greek version of a plate than what you had expected.  This is what happened to us as some of the sauces on or toppings were seasoned to taste more like Greek food.  That wasn't exactly what we expected.   So, with that word of caution at least now you know.  We didn't.  That's not to say we didn't have a great meal.  Eventually, we did.  Other than the Greek food that was exchanged for another dish, the rest of the food was absolutely delicious.  Wait staff was more than accommodating.  Other than ordering food we didn't expect, the only other issue I would mention is that original food plates weren't issued at the same time.  I really hate that when one person gets served and the other person's meal hasn't been finished yet.  So, one person starts eating while the other person watches.  Overall, we'll give it a 4 star but not sure if it should be rated a 3.  I'm sure we'll try it again and adjust the stars at that time."}
{"text":"Not the worst but won't be back.  Ordered my safe food...patty melt.  Rye bread..check.  Swiss cheese...check. Lots of grilled onions...check.  Hamburger...ummm.  Got 2 very small, super thin, obviously frozen patties.  Reminded me of the ones in the school cafeteria minus the gray color.  Boyfriend ordered meatloaf sandwich.  Two large pieces of meatloaf, bread, all covered in gravy.   Meatloaf was tasteless.  No spices at all and looked, again, like cafeteria meat.  The staff is really nice."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed when we walked in we weren't really greeted just sat down then the waitress can have us water and asked if we were ready to order we hadn't even opened the menu. Being new to this place we asked what was the best everyone liked she was rude and said everyone has their own taste. Then a few minutes later another waitress comes and asks if we're ready to order. Again it felt like they were rushing us to order. We both ordered the French dip which is my favorite dish but this was not good the meat was dry and tough and who puts shredded cheese on it? The fries weren't done. I've heard people rave about this place but I guess u have to be over 65 and have bland taste buds cause I sure was not impressed at all."}
{"text":"The prices here are great - the customers are usually seniors are a fixed income - you can not beat the prices, they are amazing and the food is pretty good.  It is not organic or healthy for you and they do not use the best ingredients - they sell atlantic salmon which is all farm raised and linked to various diseases. so be careful about ever eating atlantic salmon.  the meat loaf was very salty, the chicken soup was okay also lots of salt..  the rice pudding was terrible very bland, the pies were very sweet but the Bread Pudding was great...If you are looking for a place with some great food items which not exactly healthy ingredients for great prices then this is it - plus the staff is awesome - it is a great place to catch a burger or pancakes plus the bread pudding is great."}
{"text":"Hot, fresh, good food. A touch on the pricy side for what it was. I got the Ruben with fries. It was good but the corned beef was a little tough, I couldn't bite through it. Still good thought. I would come back."}
{"text":"I honestly don't even want to review this place because I like it so much and it's crowded for breakfast already. This is definitely my favorite breakfast place! You can easily tell that everything is fresh! It's a family run place, they are so nice and welcoming, I love it!"}
{"text":"Four of us stumbled upon the great eatery. The Food was very good and our server was outstanding. We all live in Tucson and all look forward to our next visit to Mesa so we can eat at Wild Berry Diner.  Just writing about it has made my mouth water."}
{"text":"After reading many positive Yelp! reviews, we decided to give Wild Berry Diner a try on 7/4/15. It was close by, and there was no wait for a table, which was a plus on a holiday weekend.  We both ordered from the list of specials. I had the Wild Berry Benedict and my friend had the regular Eggs Benedict.  The eggs were poached nicely, but that's where the goodness ended.  I chose the Wild Berry Benedict because it was served over cornbread instead of an English muffin. The cornbread tasted like it had been frozen (or refrigerated too long) and was then reheated in the microwave. The \"Hollandaise\" sauce was abysmal. It tasted and looked like it was made with chicken bouillon cubes; it was very salty and did not taste anything like real Hollandaise sauce.  The home fries were raw in the middle and also extremely salty.   My friend's meal was mediocre at best, especially with the faux Hollandaise sauce.  Service was interesting. Not terrible, but not good.  Next time, I'm cooking at home."}
{"text":"This little diner is fantastic. The food is delish, the portions are huge, the service is great and you can't beat the price. I will ask for my favorite servers, Ronya and/or Caryn. I love the fact that every time I visit, the owner is always around making recommendations on what to choose, sharing specials and just making sure that all of his customers and fans are  berri happy. The Friday night fish fry is also great. I would recommend to anyone who wants a hearty, home cooked meal!!!  See you soon!"}
{"text":"I would love to give a 5 star rating except my mashed potatoes and vegetables come to the table cold. I haven't said anything and even though they are cold they are still good.  Service: The staff is friendly and they are great about waiting on you. They are very helpful when your wanting to know what the specials are, which changes on a daily basis.  The Food: For me I love a down right good home made chicken fried steak dinner. I'm one of those good ol texas boys that loves to eat meat and potatoes. The potatoes are really good and seem to be real potatoes. If they are fake, then they have fooled me. The brown gravy I usually ask for on the side is really good. You can also get a homemade biscuit and that by itself is a meal of it's on. You can tell its homemade. The best part of all is the chicken fried steak. You can look at it and tell the batter is from scratch and nice and crunchy and very flavorful when it goes down the tube. If your looking for a really great chicken fried steak dinner thats homemade with all the fixins......this is the place to go to. Got room for desert? You are crazy if you do. Be prepared for an all time mini pie maybe a 10 incher or less. Either way it's big and they have plenty of different homemade pies to chose from, just ask the waitress. I ordered the Banana Cream, let's just say it was bananas.....no way could I eat it all.   Needless to say I brought mom here before and I'll continue to go here."}
{"text":"I was worried walking up to this place. I am so glad I decided to come in. The portions were huge, one plate was plenary for two people. Everything was prepared well and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast with the family and not only was the food great - it was the most welcome I've felt at a restaurant, ever.  The owners are warm and charming and have cultivated an atmosphere where guests feel like part of the family. The French toast and bacon were a hit, and the plate-filling cinnamon roll with thick icing was worth the splurge. We just found our kitchen away from home - can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place many times and always commented how busy it was. Now I know why...the owner and all the employees are super friendly. My boyfriend and I both had the Chicken Fried Steak and egg breakfast. It was homemade and hand breaded. The best I have ever had! I tried it with the red potatoes and boyfriend had the made from scratch shredded hashbrowns. After trying mine he said the only thing he would change is next time he is getting the red potatoes. They were chunked with bell peppers and fried with a nice crispy skin. We can't wait to return to try dinner. The menu has a nice selection of  food from Pot roast to Greek dinners to Italian sausage and spaghetti and meatballs, catfish, even liver and onions. Everything is fresh and homemade."}
{"text":"Visited this location last Friday evening. This restaurant was packed! There was someone who was playing the bagpipes as well. The staff was pleasant and the food was decent. Someone at our table ordered the fish platter (all you can eat), another ordered the meatloaf, and I ordered a special from the menu that was some type of turkey cranberry sandwich. Each of us also ordered side salads. I ordered honey mustard with mine and it was the best honey mustard I have had in a long time. This place has a unique vibe and I will return."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there a couple f Sundays ago.  This place was awesome!  The food was fresh, good and plentiful!  My wife ended up taking half of hers home.  I ate all of mine right then and it was awesome goodness!  I highly recommend eating there!"}
{"text":"Well, this place isn't fancy, but breakfast was good.  We had quick, energetic service from super nice people. My son had a BLT. I had eggs, sausage and biscuit with gravy. Overall, classic breakfast food with little fanfare.  It was good but nothing outstanding. I would go back, but don't expect anything other than classic diner food."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint and cheap. Try the southern Benedict...sausage patty, eggs, biscuit smothered in gravy. Mmm delicious. Try their pancakes and get a side order of sausage and bacon. It is a nice way to start the Saturday....warning you will feel sluggish after eating....I suggest taking a nap."}
{"text":"First the good: Wait-staff was friendly, fast, and attentive. Prices were pretty cheap.  Now the bad: Food quality in general was not good. The veggies were obviously frozen and not fresh, the gravy was gelatinous and flavorless, and the soup was very 'meh'. The chicken fried steak was good but the gravy was definitely a let down.  Probably would not return to this establishment."}
{"text":"I came here for biscuits and gravy at a friends suggestion. The service was great, but the biscuits were just ok. They were rather large biscuits, and kind of dense. The gravy was bland and didn't have a lot of sausage in it. A couple shots of Tabasco took care of the blandness. I read the menu and decided I would come back for an omelet or an evening entre."}
{"text":"This home cooking diner is to die for the food is amazing staff is always so friendly my favorites are Ronya and Christine but all of the servers are great owners George and Jimmy will make you feel like you are there family if you haven't tried this place make it a priority to do so best in the east valley"}
{"text":"First visit for breakfast. Great food. Eggs cooked perfectly. Will certainly return for an encore."}
{"text":"Love the soup appetizer.. delicious!! I was concerned about my AARP card ofr lack there of, but then remembered it was only 6 and the dinner crowd is made of all types. I believe this spot is located in the center of RV mecca Mesa, beautiful or not its not a late dinner crowd if you catch my drift. HOWEVER!! The staff is more than friendly and welcoming. The food is good and priced very VERY wel.. I love that they still have blue plate specials and menu boards complete with desserts in the cold case at the front door. Local mom and pop would be all encompassing, however located on a dark poorly lit road, this place would scare me... good thing its got good location and obviously local patrons. . good choice! CANT WAIT to try breakfast, which BTW is served all day. ."}
{"text":"To know me is to know what being a foodie truly is. I just so happened to be in the area and we hungry and this place turned up in my search results. Being that I live diners and the reviews were good, I thought I would give it a go. All I can say is WOW! . I love the food! . I was in search for breakfast and I found it. Man did I ever.   This is the kind of Diner I have been looking for since moving here! I had one of their specials that came with 3 eggs, double bacon (you can get half bacon and half sausage or all sausage or all bacon), hash browns, choice of toast, and since my son was with me we added one of their Belgium waffles as we were sharing. Everything was wonderful. It was way more than enough for both of us and I am looking forward to going back again and often."}
