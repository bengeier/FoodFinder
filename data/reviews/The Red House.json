{"text":"Drive by this place a lot so I thought I'd give it a shot.  Lived in Korea for a few years and I'm constantly craving Korean food.  This place is exactly how it sounds....not quite Korean, not quite Canadian.  Uses Korean spices and sauces in Canadian style sandwiches and rice bowl.  Good fresh ingredients and good prices.  I'll be hitting it again next time I drive by."}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price. Friendly owner. Plus the food comes fast. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it's all great."}
{"text":"They just opened up over a month ago. Located in the industrial area, it's a cafe/restaurant where you get to try \"Canadian food with Eh' Korean Twist.\"

I came with my friends for lunch to eat bibimbap, pork loin with curry sauce on rice, and beef noodle soup, and they were all great! The portion was large and generous, and the service was fast!

They also offer breakfast as well as soup and sandwiches.

A great place to grab a bite when you are hungry and on the go!"}
