{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years now and the service has steadily gotten worst. One server, who has been there as long as I've been going, Jesse i think his name is, hit on me and my friend, asking if we wanted to hang out later, even asked for our phone number.... I go here to eat, not to get hit on and made to feel like I need to leave because of some thirsty boy. Last time I was there, the girl who served me was very nice but never came to check how the food was and she never refilled my drink. I love the food here but if this type of service continues I will definitely be looking for another place of business to support."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a friend and instantly loved it. The atmosphere is great and the staff is friendly. I ordered the yellow chicken curry.. it was very delicious and full of flavor. I will definitely be coming back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this place. I recommend the bang bang shrimp and flank steak.  Comes with mini pho soup and salad."}
{"text":"Good food.  Large soup is VERY large!!  Our first visit & we are not well acquainted with Vietnamese food but will return."}
{"text":"They have delicious food and great service! This is definitely one of my favorite places to visit for pho."}
{"text":"Finicky kids throughly enjoyed their pho thanks to our server Hanna.  One prefers meat (ordered #7: chicken slow cooked) while the other only eats veggies (ordered chicken broth with steamed veggies/noodles).  It was our first visit and both suggestions were a huge success with both kids.    We will be back!    Quick attentative service, clean restaurant, happy kids.  Priceless!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and great service! Tom wa a super friendly.. Things to try: flank steak, chicken pho, Vietnamese iced coffee. Best I've found in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"The best pho ever thanks to the Server Areli Good Serves I dont like when I order 3er Anniversary and they dont have  it But Areli ofert me a option teriyaky or combination of 3 my family was happy"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food and service! My fave is the curry chicken and of course PHO! Thanks Jackson (Manager) for always feeding our cravings of Pho at work and at home See u soon!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's delicious. I wish they opened an other location close to home but it is definitely worth the travel.  Great service amazing food!"}
{"text":"I am Vietnamese and I really enjoy their food here.  Pho broth is well done, and like my home cook Pho the broth is clear, sweet and smell nice.   I don't normally give rating but reading some of the negative rating here, I thought it is totally unfair.   Their grills come with choice (beef, pork, chicken or shirmp or combo with all of them), it also comes with a small Pho as your soup.  Wonderful !  The price is just right for dinner but seem a bit high for Lunch. Since they do not have seperate menus (Lunch and Dinner), this may be an area where they can change and make it smaller portion for lunch and charge less. The Pho is awesome, with the noodle done right (not to soft) the brisket is perfect. Give it a try and you will not regret."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good pho this place has one of the best in Phoenix. One of my Vietnamese coworkers recommended this place. Friendly staff and good atmosphere but they always seem to be a little unstaffed so you have to wait a little longer than usual to get your food but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food and service! The pad tai was excellent and all their appetizers were just as good."}
{"text":"Ok here is what I like about the Pho:  Pros:   The food is really good (very good chef), the place is very nice inside  Here is what is not good about Phos  Cons:   Service is slow, when we walked in no one came to seat us, my companion had to go and get the waitress to seat us, she was folding napkins at the bar with her back to the door.   When they do seat you they come over and tell you to pick a table and seat yourself, they should escort you to the table and ask if the you would like to sit there.   The waitress was wearing very short shorts, this is not appropriate for the restaurant, the food is not inexpensive so they have to make a decision to have a lower price casual place or have the wait staff dress a little more appropriately ( they dont have to dress to the nines, but they can be more professional.   The reason for the 4 stars and not 3 stars, the food is really the saving grace, if is very good."}
{"text":"5/2/2015  This place is amazing, from the food to the owner who is genuine, caring and generous. Thank you again for hearing our concerns and treating us with such respect. We look forward to retuning soon and bringing more of our family and friends to your amazing establishment. We were touched at your generosity and even reminded  that a gentle approach is sometimes the best.   4/30/2015  I want to take a moment to personally thank Tom N. the owner of Angelina's for his fast response to our issue  and making things right. THAT is the kind of concern and respect we are used to receiving at Angelina's and we SINCERELY appreciate it. Thank you for your generous offer and we look forward to coming back to Angelina's in the future.   Sincerely,   B.L"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm just not much into this type of cuisine. Nothing special but what caused me to leave this review wasn't the food as much as it was the atmosphere. Yelp says open till 9:30 and states sushi bar. Neither is true. We felt so rushed just after sitting down that we should've just left and all would have ended good. They turned people away and rushed everyone so they could clock out! I'm going to guess the owner wasn't there!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly,  but slow. We ate our appetizers without plates because we were hungry.  Finally got our drinks 10 min later. The spring rolls were bland, but the free crispy roll was really good. I'd order that next time. I odered pad thai, it was okay. Didn't taste like the pad thai I'm used to from thai restaurants but still okay. Overall the experience was pleasant. But I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Vietnamese places I've been to. I always order vegetable curry, it is so good! My mom order the Pad Thai and she loved it (and she is very picky) so i was so glad that she enjoyed her meal.  When I order, I usually get it to go, but this time we dined in and the atmosphere is really nice. The waiter was friendly and very quick to serve us. The prices are great too for the amount of food they give and for the quality of the food.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a tasty meal!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place a hundred times and was always curious about it. I'd heard good things about Pho. My husband and I decidedly to give it a try during a lunch date and we were pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is warm, welcoming and even a little romantic. The food is even better. Pho is my new favorite eat out meal. Everything is fresh, delicious and healthy. It's been a week and we decided to come back for dinner....with our kids, 8 and 10. This is a true test.  Both of them scarfed down there healthy soups without complaint and asked when we could come back.  It's a dangerous thing to live so close.... Great food."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst pho establishment I have ever been to. Extremely rude server- she shouldn't be working there. A couple actually left before even ordering- we should have followed them. The pho was good don't get me wrong- but in the service industry- service is everything!! Don't waste your time or money at a place that acts like they don't even want you there."}
{"text":"Food is awesome we've never been disappointed with the food. Service here lately has really gone down the drain! I wonder why?! Last week tried to go for dinner. Appeared only one server was working and when we finally got a table we weren't even offered water. We waited 15 min then got up and left was so sad becuz we really wanted the food!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in town. Great taste with large portion. Happy hour all day Sunday. Give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is a really good surprise.  My friend saw it driving by and we decided to try lunch. Spring rolls are fresh, tasty, and crunchy. Pho was surprisingly good.  We tried seafood, chicken and a brisket Pho.  Very fresh produce, delicious broth, large portions.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Photastic ;) The best hang over food! Love the pho soup I always get the number 2 and the Crunchy spring rolls, We love going there we always go on Sundays and sit in the bar area they are very Accommodating for our big group every Sunday and have awesome drink prices!!!;) Definitely recommend this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. The pho is mediocre at best. It tastes sweet which is not how I want my pho to taste. I got shrimp in beef broth. The shrimp tasted old and was super gritty. My husband got the combination he didn't even finish it, it was that bad. He said the meat was not quality and he too did not care for the sweet flavor. The service was okay. Very polite but the server kept cleaning out table while we were eating which I found very rude and annoying. We will stick to our usual pho spot (Pho Viet) and never come back here."}
{"text":"This place is really amazing! I come here about once a week. My favorite items on the menu have to be the spring rolls! Whenever I go to a pho place I try their fresh spring rolls. Angelina's spring rolls are so unique I can't get enough! I would go for the spring and beef or the shrimp tempura ones. Another favorite item is their house fried rice. It has so much meat and so many vegetables. I am always a happy customer."}
{"text":"First visit and one I will never forget!  The Prawn Pho soup was fantastic?  It was presented in a large bowl of coconut broth with, califlower, broccoli, tiny corn, zuchinni, onions, big Prawns, and loads of noodles.  It also came with, a dish with fresh bean sprouts, basil, cilantro and 2 very hot slices of jalepeno & limes.  The meal was amazing! I managed to eat the whole thing!  The ingredients were so fresh and the service was outstanding! The flank steak meal was also ordered.  It arrived with a small bowl of house soup, (that takes 24 hours to make) rice with a bit of steak sauce underneath it and a small salad with a very light dressing.  The meat was tender and tasty. The spring roll was also delicious and the peanut sauce was excellent.  Can't wait to return to enjoy sushi!!  Some of their fish is flown in from Japan!!  You can see that a lot of love goes into to their presentation.  Their dishes are beautiful and the flavors are out of this world.  So happy I found you!  Thank You Yelp for writing about this restaurant."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite place of my wife and I's. They were doing good but were having staff problems and wait times were getting long. They have recently changed out most of their staff and the service is very much improved. So I have to give credit for a responsive management who will do something about problems so I wanted to share this information with the public.  Don't forget to get the bang bang shrimp is fantastic and the bowls are very good as well as the grilled steak.   Thanks again,"}
{"text":"Tom, owner/chef is an artist with food! His Pho is unparalleled and the menu, which he periodically changes to bring variation to our choices, has something to please every palate. What is unique about Tom is that he takes time to come out of his kitchen to welcome his guests and remembers everyone!  The Sushi Chef is talented and that has proven to be a positive addition to this already exceptional restaurant.  We look forward to every opportunity to enjoy a meal (and sometimes a cocktail/beer) at Angelinas."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and everytime their delicious food always amazes my taste buds. I tried the Yellow Chicken Curry tonight and let me tell you it was delicious!!! I will be seriously be thinking about that dish in my sleep. The staff is always so friendly and welcoming. Totally worth the 45 min drive!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least twice a week. Their pho (all of them) is amazing! House spring rolls are awesome, as well as the salmon spring rolls. Their teriyaki chicken comes out in a hot skillet (like fajita meat). Brad and Jackson are both great servers. Highly recommend getting addicted to this place."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I definitely liked this place.  The food was good and thus far they haven't missed on service each of the three times we've been there.  Unlike some of the other reviews on here we don't mind about paying an extra dollar or two.  This place is so much more aesthetically pleasing than any other pho place west of the 17.  You won't find a sewing machine in a booth, coloring books, a child's homework, etc.  The decor is modern and the bar area is nice as well.  If a dollar or two matters to you then this might not be your place... otherwise, have at it."}
{"text":"I am in love, love, love with their new lobster spring roll.  I always want to go there for two things: their generous helping of four delicious lamb chops ( yes, really) and their incredibly richly flavored pho.  Now I have to add their lobster roll.  They use all the tender meat from a 2 1/2 to 3 oz.  tail. It comes plated on a small puddle of ponzu citrus sauce that was so light and tasty that my friend and I were both eyeing it after the roll was gone.  We both could not resist swiping our finger to get another taste.  Alas, they stopped adding the four fresh shrimp chips  along side which were crisp and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Most amazing food ever! I love the food and the owner is pretty awesome too! The shrimp and sweet potato rolls and lettuce wraps are the best. The flavors he creates in a single meal leave us coming back every week!"}
{"text":"My normal pho place was closed for renovations so I ordered take-out from Angelina's. Friendly enough staff and modern Americanized decor (the Bon Appetit sign was less a play to the French influence in V, rather a convenient purchase from Hobby Lobby...) Still, it seems to be a nice place to dine in and I may have to check out HH.   Ordered veggie crispy roll, pho tai and pad Thai...  Angelina's isn't bad...it just isn't as authentic, nor flavorful, as its other nearby counterparts. I'd rank my dishes as follows: 1) Veggie roll (just plain tasty, but not unique), 2) pho tai (this rare pho was fine, with lots of accoutrements that were its saving grace) 3) pad thai (I wouldn't order again; not bad, just not remarkable...especially for $13).  Don't let my two stars seem like a complete bashing. Angelina's is fine. It just didn't grab me like I'd had hoped. If you've never tried Vietnamese, this would probably be a great starting point...and I mean that in the best of ways!"}
{"text":"Upon entry, the smell is Awesome. Atmosphere is fun, peaceful, clean. Young gentlemen greeters with polite manners makes entry very inviting. Music is piped in on the patio. The Oasis radio station playing 80's and 90's music. Soft, yet sweet. The dog joined us on the patio and that is a plus for us. Good selection of beer, wine choices are OK (pricey). Food was fresh and authenticly seasoned. We had the Seafood Claypot Soup and the Beef and Shrimp Teriyaki Entree. Neither were a disappointment. Downside: Understaffed! Food is slow to come out. With such great food, the only sadness is that more people aren't eating here. Check it out!"}
{"text":"not our usual spot but we stopped by because were on this side of town & somewhat of the reviews...  1st walked in had like 3-4 waitress looking at me, my fiancé & my daughter like we were in the wrong place or something. So....I had to acknowledge \"Them\" and asked do we sit our self??  anyways....Nice & upscale and the prices was reasonable BUT!!.. the Pho was disappointing. I agree with another reviewer that the taste was odd along with the meat! The eggroll also tasted like it was imitation meat (not pork) or something. Couldn't put my finger on it.  Also this place doesn't have your typical Vietnamese food menu like pork over rice etc and don't even have Ice-Coffee...  BUT... at least my waitress was decent & in MY OPINION it's just another Bar & Grill just with a Asian twist..."}
{"text":"We had been anticipating the opening of this restaurant for a few months now. We went last Sunday, apparently two days after their doors were open to the public.  We went in around 3 for a late lunch, and as we were greeted the server informed us that they wouldn't have any pho for another hour. Since that's what I usually get at a Vietnamese restaurant we decided to come back another time. As we turned to leave someone told the waitress that it would be ready in half an hour. We decided to give this place a shot.  We ordered egg rolls and their BBQ spring rolls. It took forever for the egg rolls to come, and when we tasted it, it seemed like mystery meat to us. I took a picture and uploaded it. The BBQ spring rolls also took forever to come, but were pretty good. Don't know why food took so long, since there were hardly anyone else there.  Finally the pho was ready so the server came to take our entree orders. We ordered chicken pho and combo grill with chicken, pork, and shrimp on vermicelli noodles (choice of noodles or rice). There were a bunch of dishes that were not available (beef pho, for example) due to their \"soft opening\". Once again, the food took forever to come out. Normally with pho you get a side dish of basil, bean sprouts, and sometimes cilantro, but nothing came with my pho here. The grilled meat would've tasted good, if only they didn't over cook everything, not to mention that it came with rice (see pic). I inquired with someone there and I think they didn't understand english, so they brought out who we assume was the owner. She said that because it's a soft opening they didn't have noodles. I guess if we were warned that this was a \"soft opening\" and that they were not fully prepared at all, at least we'd have lower expectations.  We tried to order dessert, and whaddya know, it's not available. Highly likely that we won't be back, even though this is the closest Vietnamese restaurant to us. My first thought was how can they run out of food when the Asian market is a few doors down? Too expensive for what you get, and the dining experience is horrific. The server told us that when they have their grand opening in two weeks or so that things will be much better. I'm not sure I believe that..."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get some summer rolls. Those damn rolls are the best things that have landed mouth side. And the peanut sauce... I wish I could just pour an everlasting flow into my mouth. We have been coming here for about a year now. This is our weekly go to. Take out or dine in this place is the bees knees. The decor and ambiance are average, but the owner is sweet and the food will keep you coming back. Yes, it can take a while sometimes for food to come out, but any good restaurant makes you salivate in anticipation."}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE!!!! I waled in alone and no one came by to take my order for 15min. I asked the server 3 times to take my order and they pretty ignored me. And gave full attention to the table next me who were a bigger party with more orders. I really do not appreciate this place and im not coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I have gone to Angelina's Pho and Grill many times now and haven't had a bad meal yet! The fish dishes are so fresh. They have an A rating. It's family owned. I get hung up on some dishes so have only had about half of what they offer. The atmosphere is good and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Next time I go I'll post a picture."}
{"text":"Definitely a yummy place! Enjoyed the style of the restaurant, and the service was nice. It was on the expensive side though. Prices for simple things were a little high."}
{"text":"The best Pho ever. Great fast service, perfect for lunchtime. Brad hooked us up with a fabulous Sunrise Martini! :)"}
{"text":"We had take out service again this evening-they still have not worked out all the service bugs (try to be patient :), but the food was great!  The chef/owner has a passion to serve and provide great food to his customers.  We need to support our local restaurants if we want something other than chains as our eateries."}
{"text":"I did not even get a chance to eat here because we waited 20mins to be seated (which is okay) but another 25-30mins before our orders were taken (this was after d hostess asked if our order had been taken 3 times). Very disappointed by service. Did I add that the couple who came in after us had their order taken at least 10mins before ours. I asked to speak with the manager, Tom, but he was also the chef for the night. We left and headed to \"Tandoori times 2\" few doors down. We were seated immediately, orders taken and did I mention the live entertainment. A PHO and Grill should take lessons from Tandoori Times....."}
{"text":"Very upset just left. Had recommended by a friend and given a gift certificate to try so we made this date night. Our server never gave us her name. Now we now why. Heavier set Indian girl. We ordered crisp  spring roll with chicken. It should of been cold. It was long time and room temp. She never asked how it was. She stayed in the back the whole time. We asked multiple ?s about our food b4 ordering her answers were basic and she left out so big key points like the mignon was medallions so very rare would be very impossible not 40 mins to make in a kitchen.  She never did any check back on our meal. She pretty much made our experience suck to the point of leaving. Eating nothing. The last straw was asking for Brown rice. I asked but she forgot. And she used it as an opportunity to disappear again into the kitchen for another 5 min to make us think it must need to be a prepared iteam. Like spaghetti in an Italian restaurant. Since my fiance n I have been in the industry for over 15 yrs we'd had enough. 1st I ever left 10% and I know the tip gods understand. I left her a receipt tip as well about her customer service skills. Oh 1 star because the steak was aweful and my salad was covered in minced galic. It wasn't edible. We won't be back. So sad."}
{"text":"Tried both Pho Viet and Angelina's...no comparison.  Some Vietnamese friends recommended Angelina's to us and it was worth the trip to Glendale.The service is slow, but that's because there aren't enough servers.  The food is delicious!  Will definitely return and will also recommend to others.  I suggest that they hire more servers, though."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and was glad to see a good crowd of customers. Service was prompt & pleasant. Beef Pho with added veggie was simply delicious! Perfect broth, tender meat & fresh crisp vegetables. I will definitely be back! Good job Angelina's crew!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is fresh and amazing.   Tonight we tried the salmon sashimi with Apple and pine nuts and it was outstanding.  The Pho is always flavorful and has become our families new favorite comfort food!  The sunrise ahi pizza is another treat you must try."}
{"text":"Wow-I am shocked by the poor reviews! I LOVE this place and the staff has always been super friendly! The grilled chicken rolls and the crunchy rolls are awesome! The pho is really fresh and they have THE BEST broth in town!"}
{"text":"Must visit ... amazong friendly respectable knowledgeable service ... differently a clean and beautiful place for a lunch or evening out with ur spouse or family ... fast and flavorful tasting food"}
{"text":"First time here, and we'll be back! The staff is super nice. The sushi chef gave us a free amuse bouche to start. I had a  vegetarian pho filled with perfectly cooked veggies and rice noodles, which was served with a plate of add-ins like fresh basil, jalapeño, and bean sprouts. They have Sapporo on draft. Can't wait to try the sushi next time!"}
{"text":"It used to be really nice, but now there is a horrid smell when you walk into the place. There food is SOMETIMES good (depending on the mood of the chef). They have a new waiter as well and he would rather argue how it is your fault he messed up your order. They have good spring rolls thus the two stars. Is it worth it?- you decide."}
{"text":"Do NOT go here, WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you get the heavier set girl with glasses and a little bit younger, just walk right out unless you want to sit there for a couple hours, when there is only 4 other small tables!!! There are a hundred other Vietnamese restaurant's in the valley to go to, so please do some research before you go here.  So my mother and I went here for the first time after hearing such great reviews from the nail salon. So both my mom and I were very excited. (we were going to go on Monday, but for some odd reason they're closed on Mondays???) So we get there and we order the chicken spring rolls at 6:30 and the waitress says she's going to put our order in. The waitress comes back to our table 15 minutes later saying \"the cook told me were all out of chicken.\" REALLY?? 15 minutes later you come and tell us. SO whatever we order a different kind of spring rolls. Then we place our order for our entrees and I order the filet mignon and my mother orders the curry chicken.. And again the waitress goes off and comes back 15 minutes later and says \"were actually all out of the filet mignon\" (but she had put in my mothers order already. So I tell her I want the grilled salmon with chili garlic sauce. So she's like \"okay ill go put that in\" So 20 minutes go by and my mother FINALLY receives her meal. So I'm watching and waiting for my meal (I used to work at Saigon Kitchen , so I know that since the food is made fresh that sometimes the dishes will come out 2 minutes apart) So long story short (no pun intended) haha I wait literally, not exaggerating, 30 minutes and the waitress never came over to our table to refill our drinks or to see if my meal came out or to even just check to see how my mothers meal was tasting. I finally track down this your gentlemen and tell him I've been sitting here for 30 minutes and still haven't received my meal even though my mother has already FINISHED her meal. So he goes back and checks and comes back out and says \"oh she forgot to put it in since your order changed. So it's her fault\" OKAY?? Anyway I finally get my meal literally 3 minutes later (really? so I sat and waited 30 minutes for my meal and it only takes you guys 3 minutes to cook? The hell?) And the guy nor our waitress apologized or offered to comp my meal after they already admitted it was HER fault. All the guy offered was a free fricken desert which comes in a box because we used to sell the same desert at Saigon Kitchen. The girl never came over the rest of the time until she knew it was time for the bill and she THOUGHT she was going to get a tip. DREAM ON!! So she takes my card and we literally waited another 15 minutes for her to run my card. She was doing nothing besides laughing and joking with the guy behind the bar. She had NO knowledge of the food and wasn't attentive. It seemed like she was either family or they just threw her on floor) I honestly have no idea why the owner's/and or managers haven't fired her immediately. The food was good but the awful, awful service out weighed it all. I will never go back. I left her a $1 tip for getting us our first round of drinks when we first arrived. The people at this restaurant don't even seem to care about how the customers like the food or how the service was. If they keep treating their customers this way and letting ignorant people become servers with no experience, they will end up going out of business. I'm sorry this was so long and I'm ranting, but its the truth and I wanted to write a review right away.  **Here are some GREAT suggestions for Vietnamese restaurants besides going to Angelinas Pho and Grill: Go to Siagon Kitchen in Surprise, go to Little Saigon in Glendale, go to Slanted Rice in Scottsdale, and there are plenty more."}
{"text":"Some of the best Vietnamese I've had... And while sitting on a patio outside.The grilled chicken was very good and the pho was outstanding.  The broth was expertly spiced and just rich enough without being greasy."}
{"text":"The environment is clean and I feel like the owner really tried to make the place looks somewhat modern and artistic even though it's small.  I have tried this place before. They used to play lounge music when they 1st opened and I love it! Too bad on my recent visits it's becoming like every other restaurants in the valley. If they put back the lounge music (maybe certain day?) I'll go more often :)  Anyway I recently changed my diet to plant based diet only. So I got their Veggie Spring Rolls and Veggie Platter yesterday. They were delicious especially the Spring Rolls. I also noticed that they have changed their menu since my last visits. There are more vegetarian options now. Also, my waitress Michelle was very polite and friendly. She greeted all the patrons (including me) with a smile.   The only thing that doesn't sit well with me is when they deliver my veggie platter it didn't come together with the rice at the same time. I probably had a good few minutes eating my veggie before the rice arrived. Now granted, Michelle assured me that the rice is coming so I knew she didn't forget about it. Still, I feel like it's unprofessional. It's one thing if I ordered the rice seperately but the veggie platter comes with the rice according to the menu. I guess if I have to make an anology it would be like ordering BLT sandwich with the bacons delivered after they gave you LT sandwich. Doesn't really work does it?  Overall, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here Friday night. Three different servers and a hostess looked directly at me and my wife without acknowledging our presence or attempting to seat us. After about 5 minutes of uncomfortably waiting and being ignored we left. Too bad. The food looked good and the restaurant had a decent ambiance."}
{"text":"Amazing Vietnamese food! A real find here in Glendale! My husband love the brisket Pho and the #14 prawns is absolute perfection, both are Vietnamese soups at their finest. We've come back several times and tried several new items and they never disappoint! The only critique I have is that the service can be a little slow, but they are always polite."}
{"text":"Julie our server was very nice. The Pho was excellent. We enjoyed the appetizers, spring rolls and the flank steak.  We had three of the grilled entrees and one order of pad Thai and all were excellent."}
{"text":"Great Pho.  This restaurant has become a staple for my husband and I. The upbeat, modern atmosphere is fantastic for meeting up with friends or just the two of us on a date. The cooks are willing to individualize any dish to meet specific requests.... for picky eaters like my husband.  I would highly recommend Angelina's Pho and Grill."}
{"text":"Man, this place is great. The Shrimp Pho is awesome. Sapporo beer on tap.. Nice. I will be back"}
{"text":"Recently my daughter and I went to this restaurant for a late lunch.  The service was terrible.  The food was OK.  Due to the poor service, I gave a 15% tip.  I normally tip 20-25% of total bill.  A few days later, I looked at my bank account and found that an additional amount was taken out.  The difference was 5% more.  It was exactly the 20% amount for the tip that I was charged.  I called the restaurant to speak to the owner, only to be told he was on vacation.  During my conversation with the actual waiter who changed the amount, I was told that the owner was now not on vacation and I was given his number.  I spoke to the owner regarding getting the difference back.  It was not the amount of money, but the idea that this waiter stole from me for his gain.  How many other people has he done this to.  In the end, the waiter called me back to tell me I would have to come into the restaurant to pick up a check for the difference or get a credit for another meal.  I will never set foot into this restaurant again.  BTW, if you go, I suggest pay in cash. I spoke to my bank that suggested I make a police report against this waiter.  Hmmm...decisions!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try pho at first, but after some convincing I gave it a go. I was not let down! The food was fantastic, the service was genuine, and I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"great friendly service,outstanding food , and atmosphere. I walked in for lunch and sat at the bar , ordered traditional crunch rolls, then finished my meal with Ice cream tempura. I highly recommend the dessert."}
{"text":"Definitely a great experience! First time here and we have decided that this will a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"The fried rice was very bland and Pho broth was very weak. It's unfortunate, cause the staff was friendly, with the exception of the the bartender who was texting when we entered. Try Pho Avina or Pho Tan tanh inside of Lee Lee's Market. Both places seem more authentic."}
{"text":"Clean refreshing decor- Interesting menu choices. Best crispy egg rolls. Ordered Chicken stir- fry- Outstanding!! Great service. Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I was there a few days back and went to angelinas for the great food that I have heard about. I was sitting out on the patio and the skinny blonde waitress walked right past me didn't say anything to me and completely ignored me. I had asked her to take my order and again she ignored me and then later told me that my server will be right with me. I was under the assumption she was my waitress considering she was the only waitress or waiter out on the patio apparently I was wrong. the fact that she did not say hello to me and then when I tried to get her to help me so I could order some food she completely blew me off. if it weren't for the amazing and I mean amazing food, I would never go back to the restaurant simply because of the rude bitchy waitress.  If I could I would give her service and her being a waitress a 0-star and I would give the restaurant and its food and the way the restaurant is set up a four or five star but because unfortunately I have to rate it overall it does get at 2. So when you go to angelinas for the amazing food request to not sit in the blonde section have one of the nice gentleman serve you and you will have an amazing experience with some wonderful food."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for some vietnamese food, look no further. Hands down, the best Pho I've ever had. Great atmosphere, fantastic food and super friendly staff. Even the owner came out and greeted us to make sure we were doing ok (a rare thing these days). Our awesome server Mobin, recommended the Bang Bang Shrimp and it was just an explosion of amazing flavors and textures in our mouth. Would def go back again."}
{"text":"I never imagined how delicious the Pho could be.  I had the Tonkinese (sp) Our server was so helpful with my decision.  He was knowledgeable and accommodating to my every need.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Omg the pho is off the chart the best pho around !!!! , I also got the BBQ beef and chicken spring rolls with peanut sauce yum yum yum !!!! I ll for sure be going back for more !!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Actually I have eaten here a few times in the past couple of months.  Its just a shame I found it so late in my time in Phoenix as I am moving soon.  This place is great!  The food is excellent.  You can really tell that there is someone int he kitchen that knows their flavors, and pays attention to presentation as well.  Not too over the top though.  I have been in places where it looks good but tastes terrible.  That is definitely not this place.  The only draw back that I can tell you on this is that you might wait a but for your food, even if you order a menu item like pho, which is prepared way ahead of schedule and they have to essentially \"bowl it out\".  Its also not crazy busy enough that you will have to wait long to sit.  We go even during busy times and we can usually get a seat.  Its worth the wait, but some dont like to wait and I can understand that, but its really good food."}
{"text":"5 star service. The server was very attentive and friendly.  Thank you!  4 star Pho broth and plenty of protein along with each order. We ordered #3 & #10.    1 star fresh spring rolls.  No flavor seasoning on the protein, mostly rice noodle and iceberg lettuce and one leaf of basil.  This was not worth the price.  I do not recommend ordering this item.  The peanut sauce lacked any flavor. I regret ordering 2 orders.      Perhaps next time I will only order from the grill to have more of an idea of their strengths."}
{"text":"Easily the best soup I've ever had, snow crab udon noodle. But everything they do is delicious!"}
{"text":"Came for some Vietnamese cuisine but was thrown off and confused with there menu and high Glendale prices."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last week with friends...my second visit to Angelina's. Both times the food has been incredible! Good service. Great prices. Only complaint is the waiter never came around and refilled our water....or asked if we wanted anything else to drink. Will make sure we ask next time."}
{"text":"This one star is coming from a vegetarian bias.   IF YOUR VEGETARIAN DO NOT GO HERE. Came here expecting  to try a veggie pho (didnt have it) and the server gave me a weird look ontop of it all. SO i ordered THE only vegetarian option they had (this was 4 months ago might have changed) and asked for noodles to come with it. The server said no problem. The dish came (no noodles) and he never came back for  me to mention it until i was all finished. It was whatever..nothing special..  Place prettty much blows, for non carnivores. If the service was great i would of elevated the stars...but nope..pretty poor"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying everything on the menu is great, had the mixed grill with salmon ,scallops and shrimp...EXCELLENT! Now that is out the way, the service is something to be desired, and this is not just a first visit, every time the wife and I visit service is always lacking, on this visit we got seated, and another couple came about five minutes later and got seated behind us, no server to our table yet, as they were seated waiter took their drink order and came back with their drinks, still no server for us, as they were receiving their meal our server finally showed to take our drink order...as I stated earlier food is excellent, prices have increased since we first started going, but prices are still good for what you get. If you are patient about service and great food, then this is the place, but if you are like me and this gets old (service)no matter how great the food, then you maybe want to try another spot."}
{"text":"Good pho with lots of fresh meat. Consistent good quality and I've been here at least 3 times every month for the last year. They serve sushi now on weekends and it's pretty good as well. Try the Japanese red snapper - really good."}
{"text":"Heard rave reviews about this place and decided to give this place a try.   Being Vietnamese, we always want to support restaurants that serve our cuisine here in AZ!   We walked in and saw that it was somewhat packed and thought that that was a good sign. We ordered our meals -- the boyfriend ordered #1 and I ordered #4 pho.   In a matter of minutes we received our plate of Thai basil, bean sprouts, and jalapeños. Usually that is a sure sign we will be receiving our bowls shortly. Nope, that wasn't the case.   We waited patiently and still no eye contact from any waiters/waitresses. By this time it's been 20-25 minutes and we both were getting upset that it doesn't take that long to put noodles and broth in a bowl.   I finally flag down a waiter and he goes and checks in the back to see what's going on with our order. He comes back and asks us again what we ordered. He returns and says that they are now making our order right now and it will be out shortly.   At this point everyone has their meals (even the tables' who came in after us!!) The boyfriend is upset that if we didn't flag down a waiter and asked about our meals, they would still be oblivious to us.   We no longer wanted to wait, so the boyfriend went up to the waiter and manager to tell them to cancel our orders and that we would be going somewhere else for dinner!  So disappointed in the overall service here, but even more sad that we received it from our kind!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for lunch. The beef black pepper is amazing, the crispy noodle is very light and tasty. I like the pho dishes as well. Why are are you closed today?"}
{"text":"We have eaten here 3 times in the 3 weeks.  We have tried different items each time. My boyfriend is obsessed with the Big Shrimp dish from the girl. Massive amounts of very large shrimp. Ee have both had the pho and its very tasty. I tried red curry tonight and it was so yummy. The price is fantastic as we always always have a full meal to take home. We spend  $40 for 2 with tip and have enough for the next night. We will definitely be coming back often. !!!"}
{"text":"We were on the way to our usual sushi restaurant when this place caught my eye and we decided to take a chance, and what a nice surprise.  For a Monday night the place was nearly full and we still got excellent service.  We are used to Little Saigon in old Glendale, which is pretty shabby, but Angelina's is very modern and clean, with a nice dining room, adjacent bar and unique variety of music for a relaxing atmosphere.  Happy hour is 3-7PM Mon. - Sat., and all day on Sunday with a good selection of appetizers and drink specials.    My husband and I shared a tempura shrimp, onion and sweet potato appetizer that came with a dipping sauce and lightly dressed salad on the side, which was perfect.  He got the spicy shrimp pho while I got the chicken pho and both were very good with enough leftover for lunch.  We can't wait to go back and try other interesting things on their menu and hope Angelina's stays around for a long time."}
{"text":"My wife and I were out looking for a new place to eat when we stumbled across this restaurant. It was a very clean place with a great atmosphere. Our waitress was really nice and attentive. We got our drinks and placed our order in a good amount of time. It took a while for the food to come and the place wasn't that busy. I received my food about 5 minutes before my wife's food came. The waitress was apologetic and maybe it was a bad night or people called in sick. It was a bit pricey but the food was good. I'll try it again."}
{"text":"I had never had Pho and decided to try it at this restaurant. I'm new to this area and had seen the restaurant while visiting the Asian market next door. After walking in I was immediately greeted and welcomed. I was seated and given the menu. I had alot of questions about the selection of Pho and the waiter was extremely helpful. Oh my god my Pho selection was amazing! In that month I went about five times trying a new dish each time. I'm somewhat of a food handling and clean freak and I have to say that everything was on point with this restaurant. This is now \"my spot\"."}
{"text":"Ok, We had to come back a 2nd time since the first time was excellent. and the 2nd time was just as yummy! I got the Pad Thai, it comes with shrimp AND chicken!  I was surprised it came with both but that's a bonus right?  The shrimp was cooked perfectly as was the chicken.  The chicken however is thigh meat which I wasn't prepared for, but it's still amazing pad thai. I didn't finish it so I'm now eating it for lunch 24 hours later...at my desk...cold.  Eating it cold brings out so many more flavors that I didn't experience when it was hot and fresh like the Thai basil, lime juice and cilantro. I'm a fan of Angelina's for sure. The service was superb, I don't know who our server was, but he was cool and very attentive.   I have absolutely no complaints...except they need to fix the chairs so they slide on the carpet easier :)"}
{"text":"Went to give this place another shot on Halloween. Got off work early, was craving pho and was thrilled that it was open until 10, got ready, drive there with Babe and a piece of paper writes, closing at 9pm. Super unprofessional, consistency is key and this business lacks it all over. At least update that on Yelp, clearly inconveniencing people is not a problem to these folks."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst restaurant to date. First the waiter didn't take my drink order for at least 25 minutes after being seated. Got the drinks and we were ready to order she didn't return to get the main course for another 15 minutes. She didn't refill drinks, she barely got our order right and didn't bring the \"to go\" boxes. The food was ok but the service killed the whole experience. Will never return."}
{"text":"Amazing pho!!!! I never go any where else. The calamari is amazing and all the pho dishes I've had have been perfect! The Thai tea is to die for! Oh yum!!!!! Love this spot!"}
{"text":"I ate here with my family tonight. We waited a long time for our server to come and take our order, the food came out 40 minutes later and they had missed our appetizer as well as one of our meals. None of our drinks were refilled for the hour we were there. When discussed with the staff they had mentioned they were very busy and would get to our needs when they could. The food was good but could not overcome the bad taste in our mouths from the service we received."}
{"text":"We never even got to the meal! The female manager/hostess was very rude and screeched at us when we complained about waiting so long to be seated. We also waited at least seven minutes without being either greeted or seated. Additionally, when we were finally seated at OUR request, we weren't even given menus. The staff seemed more focused on talking to each other and doing paperwork. They were only one or two tables with customers, not like they were even busy. We got up and left and they didn't even seem to care. Too bad, because we eat out a lot and become devoted to our favorite places. There are so many restaurants, why go someplace where the staff is rude and acts like they are sorry you came once they finally notice you? Even great food wouldn't be able to make up for that, but we are guessing the cuisine reflects the apathetic attitude of the proprietors as well."}
{"text":"First time, I absolutely am a Pho enthusiast and this is by far one of the best I've had. The bar server Areli was great excellent service"}
{"text":"Whay are you supposed to do when its raining out and you have a cold? A big bowl of pho.  This place has a great selection of pho.  Very clean restaurant and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I absolutely love thier Poulardine Pho( chicken)! If I get sick thats the chicken soup of my choice.  The place is usually busy with service on the slowish side, but once you get the pho it is well worth the trouble.  We also do takeouts there occasionally.  Speaking of which, Angelina's, could you please print out some takeout menus?"}
{"text":"Awesome Afternoon @ Angelina's. We absolutely LOVE this place. Check out what I had for lunch. Angelina.s owner has a great eye for what's good. Never before have I seen such a tasty selection."}
{"text":"We enjoy the pho at Angelina's. The brisket is the best in my opinion.  Their broths are like no other. Such great fresh flavor!!"}
{"text":"Love the new sushi bar! Lots of unique options and a great atmosphere...absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"Okay, after going here a few times recently, we're obsessed.  Really, really good pho soups and spring rolls to die for.  Large size shareable portions.  Great atmosphere, friendly helpful people, outdoor patio seating, and good music.  If you like good comfort vietnamese food, try this one out.  If anyone knows the west valley, there isn't much and this is a hidden little gem."}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant! I was actually thrown off by the name, and would have never imagined how great the food is. We stopped by at the recommendation of another local business owner.  There are so many options...especially options that aren't standard in Vietnamese cuisine and I think were created by the owner. Because of that and the unique names for the dishes, it was a bit hard to navigate the menu at first. I'm used to having the Vietnamese name listed with the literal translation right there as well. So I asked the server what his recommendations were, and one of the popular choices is the prawn in clay pot. Not something that I would say is a traditional Vietnamese dish--its more of a fusion dish. The portion is large, and totally worth the price. The curry could be a bit thicker, but overall the taste was there. There were plenty of prawns in this dish, not just one or two. The dish had plenty of zucchini, carrots, basil, and some other add ins. The dish features pho noodles, and is listed under the pho dishes. It also comes with the lime wedge, bean sprouts, basil, and sliced jalapeños. Great dish overall.  My mom ordered the grilled chicken with rice. The grilled chicken was seasoned lightly, and was perfectly charred. This dish was also generously portioned, and also came with a side of a mini bowl of pho with beef in there. The broth had a good amount of spice taste but could also be heartier. Overall this dish was solid.  The service was very friendly and you could tell the waiters enjoy (or seem to enjoy, at least) their job. I would definitely come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Man, oh man, what an experience. Customer service = A+ Food = A++++  The chicken pho has so much meat, so much flavor. The sweet potato roll with strawberries was accompanied by the tastiest sauce. The Bird Nest was beautifully presented and delicious. I LOVE BABY CORN.  Full bar, elegant decor, superbly clean.  We will be back. I cannot wait to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Its a nice place. Friendly staffs. High quality beef. Cuts are very thin, and fresh. Broth is little salty due to the fact that MSG is not added, but it has a strong flavor of Pho.  My choices from top to bottom:  1. Pho special 2. Chicken grill 3. Bun Bo Hue - only available on weekend. 4. Crispy noodles"}
{"text":"We are leaving right now after a great experience. The Pho (#2) was delicious, great quality. The eggplant and tofu appetizer was amazing. It was kid friendly and we didn't have any issues keeping our 2 year old occupied. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Hello Hello my Az peeps ! I know ;I have not been on in awhile, been looking for new exciting places and I found one !!! This place is better than PF Chang . It's fresh ingredients and popping flavors are sure to win you over . Great happy hour specials too . Come on my friends ...get the gang together and head on out and give it a try . Let me know what you think and as always enjoy"}
{"text":"Best pho in north Phoenix hands down. Got the Angelina's spicy lovers and that shit was fire. Just be careful not to touch the eyes after messing with the jalapeños. Burns when you touch."}
{"text":"This is not really Vietnamese cuisine. They do have the Pho soups but the rest of the menu is Asian fusion."}
{"text":"Two coworkers and I went to Angelina's today for lunch. One my coworkers suggested that we go to a Pho restaurant on 43rd Ave. and Bell however, my other coworker and I persuaded her to go to Angelina's because we previously had good experiences there. BAD DECISION!  We were immediately seated upon entrance into the restaurant (my coworkers chair was broken to the point that she couldn't sit in it) and shortly after gave the waitress our order. I ordered the Brisket Pho while the other 2 ladies ordered Salmon Pho. The server brought out 2 orders of Brisket Pho and one order of Salmon Pho. We informed him that was incorrect and he returned the extra order of Brisket pho back to the kitchen. Soon after, the waitress came out and TOLD us that we ordered 2 number 4s and a salmon pho. First of all, we never used any numbers when we ordered so how could we order 2 number 4s and furthermore \"brisket\" & \"salmon\" sound NOTHING alike so how could you get that confused? My coworker sat there with no food while we were eating (my pho was flavorless by the way). Her order was taking so long to come out that she asked to just cancel the order. The waitress was visibly annoyed and told us it would be right out. About five minutes passed before she came back to the table to say it would be another five minutes. We told her that we needed to get back to work and again asked to cancel the order. The waitress said she had to ask the manager and then gave my coworker her meal in a \"to-go\" container. ENTERS JACKSON \"The Manager\"...Jackson starts the conversation by telling us that the entrée is expensive to make, then he asked us what happened. We explained that the waitress got the order wrong, we had already been at the restaurant for an hour, we attempted to cancel the order more than once and she NO LONGER WANTED THE FOOD. We requested that they take the entrée off of the bill and they could keep the food. Jackson said he had to ask someone if he could remove the order from the bill. I'm not sure who he asked since he's supposed to be the manager (or if he asked anyone at all) but apparently the answer was \"No\".   Now after receiving well deserved bad reviews the restaurant is claiming they offered a discount. They are even accusing us of looking for a free meal! LIES! We were NEVER offered a discount and we were not looking for a free meal. We are professionals who expect to pay for our meals just like any other self-respecting person would! Instead of being accountable and using this experience as a training opportunity for the waitress, Angelina's would rather accuse loyal customers of being free loaders looking for charity. They even went so far as to call us unbelievable human beings. Unheard of! Their behavior is sickening. NEVER will I go back to Angelina's."}
{"text":"This was our first time at a Vietnamese restaurant and I can't wait to go back. The pho was amazing. The fresh herbs served with it just put it over the top. I've been talking about it all week. Try it! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I've had pho in lots of places throughout the world, although admittedly not in Asia. The pho here is as good as I've ever had. My 2 go-to orders are the brisket and rare in a beef broth, and the prawn pho, which is a red curryish soup with tons of vegetables and a nice number of plump shrimp. Other dishes look amazing, I just haven't had them since I stick with my favorites. Both the quality of the broth and the amount of meat/shrimp and vegetables stand out here. Also has a nice upscale atmosphere and lots of menu and drink choices. All for very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I brought my sister here to introduce her to pho for the first time and neither one of us was disappointed ! So fresh and delicious our waitress was amazing and such a doll. She was completely on it. Food was delicious, service was great, next time I'm on my sisters side of town I'd def come back!"}
{"text":"We stopped by to check out the new Asian market next door to Angelina's Pho.  Afterwards we had to try Angelina's.  We had the seafood pineapple and beef with green curry.   The green curry was mild but very flavorful.  The seafood pineapple was as beautiful in presentation as it was delicious.   The restaurant had a warm and  welcoming atmosphere.  When we are by next time perhaps we'll even try the Pho."}
{"text":"Great food, fast & friendly service- perfect for a quick lunch. The interior is much nicer than its strip mall exterior would have you expecting. Never drank any of their beers (lunch break problems) but I appreciate any place that has cold ones available. There's a patio for all of you people who like eating hot soup outside- another bonus."}
{"text":"Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful!!! Been here twice now with different friends and EVERYONE happy.  Food is flavorful, distinct and portions are plenty.  Always have much to take home for next day. Service is friendly and knowledgeable.  Great to have a really good local place to stop in at will.  Will be back often.  Bang Bang Shrimp are a must to try.  Pho noodle soups are as tasty as they are plentiful.  Dinner for 4 with a couple of apps came to $65.00....A bargain for a great meal in a nice restaurant.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"Good Pho I love the brisket. Nice place. We got free crispy rolls with Yelp. I ordered the large Pho and holy cow... It's huge.. So much meat and was so delicious."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and this review is based on both the food (which I didn't get to enjoy in the establish) and service.   Service: I, unfortunately, had to get my food to-go (for pho, this is definitely not ideal). We sat at the bar and this was a huge mistake. We were basically ignored and had to waive a server down anytime we needed anything (to order, utensils, water refill). They actually forgot my order... When the server put my coworkers pho down, I didn't question it because they will often bring the food as it is ready at Vietnamese restaurants, however after about 5 minutes, I inquired and she just said she forgot and would put the order in now... 15 minutes later (35 minutes after the original order & 55 minutes after arriving), they brought my soup but I was unable to enjoy it there because I had an appointment I had to go to. They weren't really apologetic and it took another 15 minutes to get our check.   Food: This was my coworker's first time having pho so he wasn't sure what to expect, but enjoyed it nonetheless. I had to eat mine hours later because I had to go straight from the restaurant to an appointment... At that point, I basically just ate the broth and noodles because I didn't want to risk the other items. What I did have was good, but I was disappointed that I didn't get the full pho experience.  I won't be back, as there are many other options in the area, with much better service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. .our new favorite place! Our waiter Jackson was very helpful friendly..there is nothing we asked for he didn't take care of and quickly. The food and prices were great!"}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time - the food was awesome.  Very fresh and full of flavor.  The service was great as well.  I will def be back soon.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Ordered the pho, flank steak, and yellow curry chicken.  The service has greatly improved,  all the food came out at once, and everything tasted fantastic.   We've been here at least 20 times before and the food has always been good, but the service fell short.  Brittany was our server this time and she has set the bar high for our future visits.  If they continue to deliver the same quality of food and service, seats will be hard to come by.   Great visit this time and worthy of this post."}
{"text":"First time ever having Pho and my taste buds were blown away! Large portion sizes, gluten free menu with numerous Pho options, great vibes,  and friendly staff. Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"very slow service, arrived at 5 pm and waiter took our order a bit after , our pho never arrived we ended up walking out at 5:40 once we noticed that the table of 6 next to us had gotten there 20 minutes after us and had already received their food. The staff was nice just very slow service, we ordered #6 and # 8, wish we could have enjoyed with all the great yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Service was good. The interior of the restaurant is nicely decorated- Americanized. I ordered just the regular rare beef pho. It was good, but I had better. I do recommend it. I will be back to try other items on the menu..."}
{"text":"Angelina's continues to serve up amazing Pho!! Today I had the chicken pho and it was amazzzzing. The service was awesome even tho my favorite server Jackson wasn't there. The veggies are always fresh & the pho is always hot. There's a perfect amount of meat to noodle ratio, Angelina's never skimps on the meat. The ambiance of this restaurant is a calming and comfortable setting and the staff treats each customer like family."}
{"text":"I went with my friends (group of 6) to this place for dinner. This place looked clean and cool, however it looked like a bar than a restaurant. We all ordered Pho (large and small). They used good quality materials for the food. The beef is soft and delicious. However, as a Vietnamese who have eaten Pho for more than 20 years, I would say the overall tasting of Pho in this restaurant is \"decent\". Yes, all material are high quality but the overall tasting is decent. I would rate 5.5 or 6 / 10 for this overall taste of Pho here. In addition, we waited for so long for our food (we even wondered whether they forget our table). There was one bonus point for this place, they gave us a free desert (3 slices of cake) because of the holiday."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly. The spring rolls were fresh and tasty. Great happy hour."}
{"text":"Pho here is expensive @ $8/ bowl. Compared to Pho Thanh @ $4-5 per bowl. It taste OK, but I've definitely had better like the Pho at Pho Thanh, it has a much beefier and more flavorful taste to the broth. They don't serve you a separate plate of garnish either like (peppers, onions, cilantro, or lime) everything is mixed into the soup already."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to write a two star review for a new restaurant.  Lord knows anyone who dares open a restaurant these days has a lot of challenges, but I can't recommend this new Vietnamese spot simply based on the food. The restaurant looks great, and the staff was very friendly but unfortunately that's where the positives end.  I came in the other day and ordered a small pho tai which should be the signature dish of a Vietnamese restaurant.  I found their prices to be a bit high, but I figured what the heck-it's so much fancier than the Vietnamese places that I frequent.  I noticed the chef pouring pho bowls while I was waiting and the broth was barely brown...maybe it's pho ga I thought...regrettably, my suspicions were confirmed when I finally got my beige pho tai. Pho broth is the holy grail IMHO, with it's deep beefy flavor combined with the sucker punch of star anise, clove and cinammon-it's probably the most soul nourishing dish that I've experienced when done well.  Pho & Grill's version was completely lackluster and even the additions of the Thai Basil, cilantro and a healthy dose of Sriracha couldn't rescue it."}
{"text":"Our family loves going here, and we have some picky eaters in the group. The food is delicious and the service is the best. Everyone is kind and attentive. Not much more you could ask for from a local family run restaurant!   I love the Praws \"Angelenia\" Pho, and my family loves the pad thai, chicken pollarding pho and the spring rolls.  Really anything we've tried we love.   I know they opened a sushi bar, but we haven't tried it yet, looking forward to it!  And lots of sake options if you like!   We go weekly and they actually remember our orders!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Roulade Flank Steak and Bang Bang Shrimp (OMG). Everything is soooooo good but I'm currently completely stuck on #7 Pho - Tonkinoise. Filled with every kind of veggie you can imagine plus charred flank steak. Wow. Hubby almost always gets the Combination of Three from the grill menu. The meats are always perfect no matter what he chooses.  If you are on the fence about going here don't be. I promise you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We discovered this restaurant while starving and driving down bell road.  Since we both love a good pho, my husband and I stopped in to give it a try.  The service was attentive and we fell in love with their tempura appetizer, right off the bat.  Our meals were both excellent and served piping hot.  There was a brief wait in between courses, but I believe that their chef's cooking was well worth it.  I'm a little puzzled by the other luke-warm reviews as this is one of the better Vietnamese restaurants either my husband or I have ever frequented.  Give it a try, I think you will be pleased."}
{"text":"Come back on Saturday night around 8:30, it was quite slow.I am not trying to be mean.i ordered paid Thai and pho noodle soup .the paid Thai is definitely not the real paid Thai you order at Thai restaurant, the pho is just taste no favor like water (no salt ). Really good service ! But not planning to come back ."}
{"text":"The food is great,  however,  service sucks!  No other way to put it,  if you're willing to wait to get greeted and  have your order taken then no biggie.  It's the usual here!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in town!  We love the combo meat plate as well.  All the meat is so tender and taste amazing.  Don't forget to try the spring rolls too."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Best part about Angelina's is the Bang bang shrimp appetizer.   Slow service, average pho, less options than most. They don't carry oxtail unfortunately.   Broth is savory, mediocre meat quality."}
{"text":"We came along way to try this because my mom said the curry was amazing, with a little bit of doubt I came along with my family.... man. AMAZING. The food was great, dessert was to die for (flan was so creamy), not only that but Areli made out experience out of this world. As my mom said, she treated us like royalty hahaha! The whole experience was well worth the drive. Thanks guys, we will be coming back, save some extra dessert for us! Thank you so much Areli for making our family night so special. Xoxo"}
{"text":"First timer at Angelina's, I ordered Pho with chicken and fresh spring rolls for pick up. The broth was savory and delicious, they provide more add-ins for the broth than most places I've been to (thinly sliced onions, green onion, their own hot sauce). The spring rolls were refreshing, 3 big pieces of shrimp included! Very filling! I bump them down to 4 stars because of how long it took for my pick up order. They told me 15-20 minutes over the phone, and I arrived within 30 minutes and had to wait an extra 15 minutes for them to prepare my order. BUT it was around dinner time, and they offered me a beverage while waiting, I appreciated the hospitality! I recommend you try this place out!"}
{"text":"We had dinner last night . The waiter was attentive coming to our table about ten times.we started with their pho with beef brisket , the soup base was a little salty and the brisket a little over cooked.we then tried their spicy  shrimp and beef pho , the meats were plentiful but  could have used more noodles. Again the broth was salty. We then tried the ya ki soba noodles .The noodles were saucy and way too sweet We did like their grill meats. The place was very clean and  nicely decorated"}
{"text":"It was great...found my new favorite pho place... The Labour of the broth and the brisket is just too good!"}
{"text":"My dad wanted to take us out to eat for an early Christmas dinner and wanted Vietnamese food. We decided to give this location a try as it was convenient and not too far from where we were at.  Unfortunately the experience wasn't that great and highly disappointing due to the good reviews it has received.  We arrived around 6pm on a Friday night and were seated after 15-20 minutes of waiting.  The service was disorganized and very slow.  My wife ordered the chicken and shrimp pho, our server came back to our table to tell us they were out of prawns and shrimp.... It was only 6pm on a Friday night, how could you already be out of prawns or shrimps when there is a Asian market right next door?  My dad ordered the salmon dinner entrée, it came out overcooked and very hard.  They tried to cover it with some type of veggie topping but even then, it did not help at all.  The best part of the evening was my pho bowl, that was good but I would not come back just for that.  There are better options for Vietnamese food near the area in my opinion."}
{"text":"First time visit.  We really enjoyed the dining experience.  Had appetizers of calamari and crispy spring rolls.  Excellent!  For the main dishes we had a soup and the chefs special.  The meal was delicious.    Service was prompt and courteous.    Ambiance was enjoyable.    Looking forward to many return visits."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly.  Place was slow. . They do take reservations.  The grilled  combination of  meats were not on the menu . Menu is confusing . Service was a little slow.  Soup was salty.  I do like that they give you a small bowl of pho.  Grilled shrimp  was good but very small. Pork and beef were dry. Staff was friendly"}
{"text":"A little pricey for pho soup but the food is really good. I got the house salad and a bowl of pho soup.  Service was great ..I'll be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in last Saturday for lunch. I had seen the signs up for weeks about the place opening and was happy to see it finally was open.  The restaurant was nice and clean, and had plenty of staff checking in on us. We ordered the BBQ spring rolls for an appetizer, those were really good.  They come with a side of this yummy peanut sauce that was pretty darn good.  With our appetizer we got 4 full size rolls that were plenty for the two of us to start.  I must say  that the happy hour was already started around 3pm, forgot what hours they were good from but I believe you get a discount on the apps, and beers were cheap, like $2.50 for even the premium ones.  I ordered the second pho dish on the list, they have two sizes, medium and large.  I ordered the medium and it was really good.  The bowl was huge, I had so much for leftovers I had it for dinner later that night.  My husband ordered a stir fry dish and he said that was good too.   What really stood out was the great service we got.  All the employees were really nice and answered all our questions.  I believe either the owner or manager came out and welcomed us and thanked us for coming in to try the food.  I felt very welcomed and it was nice to get the extra attention.  On cold days like today pho is perfect, so go try it."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered were a delicious!!! Brad our server recommended Bang Bang Shrimp for appetizer was amazing! The pace was great. We highly recommend this ppace"}
{"text":"First time here. Love it! Beautiful restaurant! Great service! Food Amazing! Got #11 son got #17."}
{"text":"Delicious, Amazing, Excellent spring roll with peanut sauce and house roll. Pho was delicious, but way too much cilantro. My aunt got the same pho as me and her's had little cilantro but mines had plenty, plenty.. The cilantro ruined my pho. May come back,  unsure but for the rolls yes I will be back. Also service was horrible we had to wave down the waitress before she came to our table and had to eat most of our meal without our beverages-she took forever to refill it. Will come back for the rolls and maybe another dish besides their Pho."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best! They really care about their ingredients and quality! every time I go there something new for me to try."}
{"text":"Glad we stop at this pho place while we are in this part of town. I don't think I can have any other spring Roll than this place. It was the best chicken spring Roll I have in my life. :-)"}
{"text":"This place is more 3.5 than a 4 but I rounded it up.  Pros: Good food Great ambiance and love the more modern decor. When i used to live onthe west side, not being able to be around more modern design makes me feel blah. This place use to play chill/lounge music too. Not sure about now but thats my kind of beats that most ppl on this state dont get. Friendly staff  Cons: This place is slow. Although the staff Ive been dealing with are friendly, they seem to be very disorganize. Be ready to wait for awhile for your food."}
{"text":"Pho-nomenal! I first started going here to quench my craving for Pho. I was so please when I walked in and saw how cute this place was. They have since added Sushi, and many creative and fun dishes. Although I have yet to have one of their entree's its next on my list. Their Sushi is always fresh and delicious. They have daily specials. And their Pho is some of the best I've had. I've also tried a few appetizers, the tempura shrimp is a MUST try. I have brought my brother, friends, had happy-hour, and date nights here. So its pretty much a place for any occasion. They have a dog friendly, and cute little side patio. The interior is always being updated. The Chef's and Staff are always super friendly and good at what they do. I have not one negative thing to say or anything that I would change. I can't wait to try a few of their entree's, take some photo's and update my review. I have no doubt I will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was the \"A\" health grade in the window. Upon entering we were greeted with the wonderful Evelyn, who happens to have beautiful eyelashes . The server was amazing and gave some very good recommendations . Tried Pho for the first time, OMG!! Will definitely come back. All of the food was amazing and very authentic. The salad on the combination plate was so fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Food is always on point and great happy hour specials! My favorite item on the menu is the birdsnest where you get chicken shrimp and veggies on top of a crispy bed of noodles. So yummy!"}
{"text":"Seriously great food and the staff is amazing. The owner Tom knows your name and is really personable.   Stop in whenever you get the chance and try this amazing food!!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! We go at least once a week....sometimes 2 or 3 times :P The food is incredible and the service is always great.  Jackson is our favorite server..he's very personable is seems genuinely happy to see us when we're there.  Everything we have had is always fresh!  The kids also love going too...great menu choices and good sized meals for them. We used to go to George and Sons weekly and we have given it up...not sure if their quality went down or if Angelina's has just blown them out of the water! Either way, we are so happy we found Angelina's!"}
{"text":"Although I was disappointed with the authenticity of the menu, I was pleasantly surprised of how good everything was.  The service was excellent and the servers are very personable.  I only wish it was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this place when we have a craving for pho. Friendly staff, good service & great food! I always get the chicken pho & every time I have leftovers for home. (I order the medium) Good portion size for the price. Nice little place inside."}
{"text":"Awesome get the Shrimp pho which is more like a thai dish."}
{"text":"Hands down best place in Phoenix/Glendale for Vietnamese food or sushi.  The drink specials will keep you there and the food will keep you coming back. The amazing staff doesn't hurt as well, they are always there to great you immediately upon arrival and get you exactly what your ordered as quickly as possible and make sure everything is to your liking.  They will even bring you something special and new they recently created without you even asking.  Great place to relax on the patio with family and friends or have a couple sake bombs at the bar.  If you are lucky enough to stumble into this place ask for Brad, he makes a great experience \"amazing\"."}
{"text":"I recommended this place and I regret it. First I was placed in a broken chair. Then i asked for the salmon Pho. The other guest with me all got their order but I was given brisket Pho. How you get brisket from salmon I will never know. Anyway it took so long to get my correct order I asked the waitress to cancel it and she Didn't want to. I said I need to get back to work so they have it in a to go container. At this point my appetite is gone and I don't want it. Jackson who says he was the manager came over with no empathy like we made the mistake. He wanted to know what happened, for what I don't know he was useless. Wouldn't remove my order even though I canceled it. No discount. Nothing. Customer service is not in their vocabulary. There is a better place down the street on 43rd ave and Bell as well as Thunderbird rd. Never going back and would never recommend.  ***Mr Tom I didn't want the meal so let me correct you right there. Your waitress wouldn't cancel my order number one. Your waitress got it wrong. Second I don't know who you offered 50% to but it wasn't me. Get over yourself and own that you all did not do a good job today. I didn't even eat the crap. I'm a great human being you just have a hard time with honesty and ownership. Be blessed and good luck!!! ***"}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean, inviting and the aromas of freshness and flavor are ever present.  The pho was good and the jasmine green tea tasted good."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister.  Unfortunately it was not the best service.  They may have been under staffed. We walked in and noticed most of the tables were empty and dirty. We wanted to sit outside anyway and enjoy the weather.  There were kids running around our table and playing in the fountain right next to us. 2 different families totally disregarding what thier children were doing.  Making out dining experience a bit miserable.  This wasn't the restaurants fault, but we waited and waited forever to have our drink order. To the point when they finally came and got our drink order we knew what we wanted to order.  My tea was disgusting and wasn't even filled up completely. My sister's drink wasn't filled up completely either and wasn't made right. I was given dirty plates and the teriyaki sauce container was disgusting.  The food was really good! They couldn't separate our bill accurately.  The service really sucked!  I'm not one to complain much because I understand stuff just happens, but disappointment after disappointment is really a bummer and I won't be coming back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was some of the worst I've ever experienced and that is an understatement.   Mind you, there were only 3 other parties other than ours and 2 parties were only 2 people and the 3rd was had three people- so NOT busy when you have 2 servers working the floor.   I ate there Tuesday with my husband and 2 kids. Our server was inattentive, our food came out at separate times (my pho came out last and at least 30 mins after I ordered, where in the world does pho ever take THAT long?) and on top of that, they charged my card TWICE. I'm nearly certain the server who helped us (a heavier set girl who didn't give us an option to have the happy hour beer which we were ordering and and was very dismissive when I asked her about it.) did it on purpose because we gave her a shitty tip. She honestly deserved NO tip. And my husband and I are good tippers, 20% at least, we have both worked/are currently working the food service industry.  We didn't even see our server at all after we ordered. She didn't bring us our food, someone else did. Passed our table once. Then the rest of the time, her and a male server were just fooling around behind the bar wrapping napkins with who I'm assuming is a manager. Not checking or paying attention on any diners.  Someone from another table had to get up to get a water refill from the male server because no one was coming into the dining room to check on anyone. I had to get up to ask about the beer when our server threw me all kinds of shade and then I was trying to hand her our check and she walked away so I had to go after her again.   The unfortunate thing is that the food is actually really good and had there been better service I would have at least given 4 stars. 5 if the service was great. This goes to show that it doesn't matter how good your food is, if your service is shitty, you will not insure repeat customers.   NO we will not come back unless the staff changes. I'm all about service. I would much rather go to Pho Viet down Bell because there food is just as good but they have excellent service.   I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! Service is everything. You will find better service at a hole in the wall pho place where no one speaks english."}
{"text":"Amazing Pho! I really like he ambience of the place and the waitress that served my friend and I was very friendly I forgot her name. :/ anyway, if you're looking for a good place to get pho come here! You'll enjoy it. :)"}
{"text":"So, today was my first time coming to Angelina's. I have driven by it many times and have been wanting to try it for quite a while!  Let's start off with the bad.  I walked in and there were a few people in the restaurant and only 2 people sitting at the bar. Since I was alone I decided to also dine in at the bar. I sat down and made eye contact with the man behind the bar and he did not even greet me, he just walked away. Another 5 or 6 minutes go by until I am greeted, I had to grab a menu from the hostess stand.  My order was put in and then a big group came in and I thought to myself \"thank goodness I got here before the rush\".....  Yeah well, no such luck. After 15 minutes go by I start to get a little annoyed.. considering there was hardly anyone in there when my order went in, it should be coming out by now.  At 20 minutes, one of the servers came up to me at the bar to tell me it should be any minute, but he looked pretty worried like they had forgot to put my order in.  At 25 minutes another server comes up to me to say it will be any minute now!  At 30 minutes I went up to tell them they will need to make it to-go now since I have to go back to work.   Perhaps the worst part about it, and when I knew for sure that they had forgot my order, was when the gentleman who ordered 10 mins after me at the bar, got his food well before me.  To their credit, they did apologize many times for the wait, and they were friendly. What irks me though is that no compensation was offered whatsoever. Hell I would have even appreciated 10% off at that point. It was clearly their fault and they dropped the ball, they should have been willing to offer SOMETHING. I literally ordered one thing.  One more thing which was really icing on the cake... when I finally got back to work ready to dive in, there was a very long black curly hair sitting right in there. Looooovely.  The good:  I got the yellow curry with chicken.. it was some of the best curry I have had. I will definitely be back to try more of their food and hopefully I have better service next time and can edit my review because I really hate leaving poor reviews. I will just make sure to never come here when I have plans after!  All in all, if you aren't miserable enough working 9 hours on a Sunday, head over to Angelina's for your 1 hour lunch break in 120 degree weather where you can spend 90% of it waiting for your food."}
{"text":"Angelina's was absolutely wonderful! The Crispy Crunchy roll was amazing, and our server Brad totally made the experience memorable."}
{"text":"My family loves this place!  Delish fresh food, excellent service, yummy drinks and vietnamese coffee!! Everyone that we have shared this little gem with agrees and always wants to go back!"}
{"text":"This is BY FAR the BEST place for pho and for vegetable spring rolls...and for tofu! Their tofu stack = AMAZING! The spring rolls = HUGE! Their peanut sauce = does NOT disappoint! Their pho....sooo goood!! The service = best ever! I'm serious. I've been to quite a few pho spots in chandler and Phoenix and his is the one. My nail lady is he one who recommended because she KNOWS! And, you'll agree...especially if you've been to the others."}
{"text":"My usual order of Special Angelina's large has shrunk into a kid's meal with their new bowls. One rainy evening I went in with a friend hoping to have a large warm bowl of pho only to be greeted with a bowl of noodles my baby nephew would order. Eating Pho for so many years I can tell you that no one should leave hungry after ordering a large Pho."}
{"text":"If I could give them 10 stars I would.  Their food is so fresh and flavorful.  Its obvious the chef is a true artist."}
{"text":"I literally started puking my brains out after eating at this place. Ate at around 8pm proceeded to die at 12am. Stayed up all night with my roommate taking turns yacking in our bathroom toilet. No lie I think it looked just like the beef Pho I ordered from the restaurant. You think I'm trying to be funny... I wish. Sub par  Pho is not worth 36 hours of food poisoning."}
{"text":"Angelina's is one of my favorite places to go. Every time I walk in everyone including the owner says hello to me and makes me feel welcome. You can tell most everyone who works there has a caring heart. The decor of the restaurant and everything about it is very new age and doesn't feel like a hole in the wall \"ma and pa\" shop. It's beautiful.   The food is amazing! Everything I have had there has been fantastic. I trust in the food and the service so much that sometimes when I go by myself to have a drink and relax the server Brad will simply order something new for me and I like it every time. He is a genuine person and takes care of his customers, he makes you feel like a friends versus a paying customer. The majority of the staff is great as well. Tom( the owner) is great, you can tell he truly puts his heart and sole into this place and wants nothing but the best for it.   So when you go some of my favorite are: the rare pho ( #3 to be exact), Fried calamari, flank steak, and the bang bang shrimp can't go wrong anyway. OH and there is a special drink that the server Brad has created, not sure what he calls it but it's fantastic! MUST GO!!!!"}
{"text":"Best meal we've had in a long while. My son had the Luc Lac (filet mignon), my mom had the lamb, and I had the seafood pho. We had the fried bananas for dessert. Everything was perfect, and it's not easy to satisfy all three of us. My mom and I didn't even have a chance to try the Luc Lac - my son made it disappear embarrassingly quickly. Our server was a very nice guy, too, attentive without being overbearing.   The only notes to myself, tho, is to order some extra broth for the soup right away (I like it brothy, and the cook obviously doesn't) and to order the coconut-lime ice cream that comes with the fried banana separately - it's absolutely perfect. I'm lactose intolerant and I know how hard it is to find a really good dairy-free ice cream. Next time I will order the mango mousse, because there for sure will be a next time.  The whole meal for 3 people with a dessert (no alcohol or coffee, tho) was just $60. A very decent price for such a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I just cleaned up my plates...oh my gosh first time in a long time having a good good satisfied meal in Arizona...I used to live in Vegas and have been never satisfied with the foods here..til this one. So so good. I am def coming back !"}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the past month. I'm completely addicted. I have always ordered something different. Today I let our server, Evelyn, order for me! She nailed it! She ordered the #6 pho... Spicy w/ beef, shrimp, tripe, meatballs etc. Absolutely delicious! She also recommended the #3 entree....steak, pork, shrimp w/ salad, pho & rice. Couldn't have done better at choosing our meals myself! Angelina's is very clean and comfortable. Love these black chairs;) Staff here is quite personable and friendly. Evelyn is super sweet and has a great sense of humor. Sushi bar is coming along so I can't wait to try it...once they get a sushi chef here. I highly recommend Angelina's folks! One of My favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"Best pho I've had in AZ. Very nice restaurant ambiance and our server was so nice. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because there was a piece of beef tripe in my chicken pho and it almost made me throw up when I saw it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty good. Me and my sister ordered the spicy calamari and sping rolls for our appetizers. It was good, the calamari was nice and crispy. The springrolls were good. I ordered the spicy lovers pho noodles and it was good. Nice and spicy yet not too spicy. Lots of noodles and meat. I would come again."}
{"text":"Just tried for the first time, and I loved it. The restaurant is very modern, and I love the atmosphere. It would be a great date spot as well. I tried the prawns pho with the coconut curry broth instead of the traditional pho, and really enjoyed it. It is a little more on the pricey side than other Pho places I have been to, but it was still very tasty and I will be returning :)"}
{"text":"The ambiance here is very much like a happy-hour type of place you go on a Friday night. It's dimly lit and they have soft music playing in the background. It's definitely not your typical 'pho' restaurant. They even have a full bar! What kind of pho restaurant has a full bar?!  Their staff was very friendly. The menu is very straight forward and simple. Nothing too complicated, everything is in English.  The only thing I didn't like, was the price for the amount of food. I paid $9-something for a tiny bowl that didn't fill me up. I'm not saying that's breaking the bank, but you know pho spots will generally give you a huge bowl that stuffs you. Still, the broth was good and I suppose you pay for the ambiance you're walking into."}
{"text":"Best spring rolls I've found in Arizona! Fresh, good ingredients, delicious. Shrimp pho was good. Chicken broth instead of beef was different but good. Staff was really friendly and attentive. This will be my go-to especially BC the location is so convenient."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the best pho places in town broth is tasty and they actually put enough meat in the soup aways a happy customer keep coming back."}
{"text":"The Pho here is excellent!  Stopped in for lunch and I'm already thinking about the next time I can go back.  It's really hard to find authentic Vietnamese here in the Valley, but this place does it, and does it right.  My service was also really on point.  My diet coke was always full, so again it ticks the box for what a great Vietnamese place should be.    Next time I come, I have to try the grill portion of the menu.  I saw a grilled shrimp dish come out while I was waiting for my Pho and it lookes awesome!  I'll have to make the trek on a weekend and bring my wife.  Great food, nice atmosphere, and good people make this place a must stop for the Vietnamese cuisine lover in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I got carry out and the food was good, only they charged my card 4 x for the same transaction and added in a tip for themselves in an amount that I would have never given. BAD KARMA"}
{"text":"This was such a mixed experience! I am settling on a 4-star rating, not because it's an overall 4, but because some elements were a 3 and some a 5.   Right when we walked in the door, we got a super nice, welcoming greeting from an employee on the other side of the restaurant, and she let us know someone would be right with us. But then a guy came over to seat us and he just seemed to be in a very bad mood. Didn't say anything, just motioned to a table and tossed two menus down. So that was a little off-putting.    Our server came over and again was super friendly and nice so we thought we were back on track for good service.   We ordered the spicy calamari appetizer. Unfortunately, we were brought two dirty plates for the appetizers and the lady who brought them (not our waitress) seemed entirely ticked off when we asked for new plates. I am not one to complain or send things back, but they had actual debris on them so it was justified to ask for new ones.   The appetizer was a mixed bag:  The calamari itself was a little bit rubbery; it was processed calamari 'rings' - calamari doesn't occur in nature in a nice little ring shape :-) - and it was a little bit greasy, but on the plus side, the spicy seasoning mix was a total hit. Spicy, not salty, and just a really unique flavor.   We tried the Jasmine tea to drink. It was weak but had good flavor. If it had been a bit stronger, it would have been a lot better.    For entrees, my husband had pad thai, and I had fried rice. The pad thai was pretty good but my husband thought it was a little sweeter than he'd have preferred. It is a very good portion size though, and was cooked well.   Here's where the 5-star part comes in: the fried rice was OUTSTANDING. It has generous portions of perfectly cooked, totally identifiable veggies (as opposed to the bits of color that you can't be certain what vegetable it's supposed to be that you find in more processed food), big pieces of chicken, and large whole shrimp. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted super fresh. It was easily the best friend rice rice I've had in AZ.   Our server herself was very nice and friendly but other employees came off as pretty rude, so the service brings down the rating.  The seating inside, and outside, looked very cute and was comfortable. It seemed pretty clean (other than the appetizer plates). And the food ranged from definitely would not order again (calamari), to probably wouldn't order again, not because it was bad but mostly due to personal taste preference  (pad thai), to absolutely will order again (fried rice). So... I'm splitting the difference between the 3 and the 5 and calling this a 4."}
{"text":"We're Baaaack!  Craving Pho less than week after our first visit. When we arrived the place was filling up with other Pho Lovers!  We were surprised to find out that Happy Hour was available daily so we suited up with a Kirin sake bomber, an Asian Pear Martini and an order of spring rolls. The martini was great and is recommended. The spring rolls were fresh and filled with fresh ingredients, sliced pork and shrimp!  Served with yummy peanut sauce.   Just in time, the entrees arrived for us to split. The Pho with Prawns was steaming hot and but was filled with fresh veggies, Prawns and rice noodles. The broth was perfectly seasoned with lemongrass and coconut milk.  The aroma was magnifique. Our other dish was off the grill. Choice of (3) marinated meats sprinkles with roasted peanuts. The flank steak, charbroiled pork and grilled chicken were served with sauces for dipping, jasmine rice, a cup of Pho and a small salad. Everything tasted great. There was so much food we had to pack up about 1/2 and take it with for tomorrow's lunch. Service was very friendly and prompt. We love this place and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Omg, so good!!! The staff is amazing,  loved this place!! Delicious, clean and friendly!!"}
{"text":"This was a challenging review to write, and to decide on a rating.  The good...  Food quality was very good, and most things were quite tasty.  The not so good...  Service was rather slow, and then after the food arrived our waiter disappeared for almost ten minutes and I wanted to get some side sauces that weren't brought with my meal.  They also don't have some Vietnamese standards at all, like noodle bowls, which one person in our party was looking for.  So overall, it's not for us, but I'd still give it a try if you're nearby."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place but the past 3 times   my family and I have been in we walked out. No one acknowledged me all 3 times as I stood at the front for over 5 minutes. I really hope you guys can fix this problem I really enjoyed your food"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Sunday with my wife and kids. We were seated right away. The place is popular but neither too crowded not too loud. The ambiance and decor are awesome. The service was attentive and friendly.  I had the black pepper flank steak served over jasmine race with a side salad. My wife had the flank and veggie pho. The kids all had the chicken pho. All meals were great and portions were generous, and every one enjoyed their dishes.  Great find! We will definitely come back, with the family and on a date night!"}
{"text":"The actual meals were great. I was not the biggest fan of their Pho broth; something seemed to be missing. The atmosphere was very pleasant and so was the staff. I would recommend coming here for a night out."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this for the first time and we were just blown away!! Best Vietnamese food we've had, and I'm Asian, so I've had my fair share! For appetizers, we had the shrimp and chicken BBQ veggie roll and steak roulade! These were both just amazing! Definitely must try's! The combo grilled plate of chicken steak and shrimp was just $15 and it comes with three sauces on the side!!! Super priced and quality is top notch. Our new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the valley!"}
{"text":"From what I tasted and saw on this last visit. I have to say Angelina's has really stepped it off on service and the Pho has greatly improved. I don't know if this was a good day or if they are this good all the time since I don't come often enough to know. They also post a current Grade A Maricopa certificate on the front door.  I got the Chicken Pho it was made with tender fresh white meat chicken. The broth tasted fresh made and was delicate with ginger and other flavors. I thought the broth had good flavors and I added the side plate of cilantro, Thai Basil, Jalapeños and lime. I didn't think I needed to add any sauces. At other places I have added sauces.  I ordered a large because it was only one dollar more than medium and I thought the medium might be too small but the large was way too much food for me. I don't know how much chicken they gave me but I couldn't eat it all. And I had enough noodles for four people I think. The very hot pho started to cook the chicken more and bring out the jalapeños to full strength. So you have to try to eat it as fast as you can because the chicken starts to dry out and the soup grows with too much spice.   My waiter was very sensitive and I almost offended him by leaving too many noodles in my dish. I insisted to him that it was very good and I was very full.  My husband had the rare beef and brisket pho. This time it was much richer with beef flavor than it was before and like the chicken pho it was very well seasoned. He said the rare beef also continues to cook but the brisket stays delicious and tender the whole time.  I do note they only gave us one small plate of the cilantro and other toppings to share but the waiter did offer to give us a second plate so you might have to ask for a second plate if there are two or more of you having pho.  It really was good I have to come here more often!"}
{"text":"Very very very very GOOD!! GREAT CREW ... Friendly.. Helpful!! And I'm still here... Think in dessert now!! Menu please.. AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"The thing to keep in mind about Angelina's is that it is not your traditional Vietnamese Pho noodle shop. Rather, it is a modern and often inventive take on Vietnamese cuisine that combines a lot of the traditional along with cross-cultural influences to create a nouveau fusion blend that is both original and exciting.  Angelina's has a modern-contemporary decor well suited to the culinary flavor.  Angelina's menu has expanded considerably since their launch, and creations such as crab meat udon and tofu-eggplant stacks are welcome additions though perhaps not to everyone's taste. Portions are reasonable and prices are about average. Certain menu items are only available on the weekends such as the spicy Pho.  Wait staff and service at this restaurant tends to be decent (somewhat hit or miss depending on the day and time). That being said, I have never experienced really bad service at this restaurant, and thus far my experiences have been positive on average.  As with all restaurants that rely on a high level of culinary skill, the food quality of Angelina's depends on the chef. Therefore, again depending on the day and time, there can be variation in the quality. Overall, the food quality is very good, and comparable to the best out there. One menu item deserves special mention: the barbecue spring rolls are simply divine. Think a traditional Vietnamese spring roll (pork, lettuce, vermicelli) but with added avocado and grilled pork. It is simply the best spring rolls I ever had - the creamy avocado texture complements the sweet crispy pork perfectly."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely fantastic!  I would recommend the bang bang shrimp and ahi tuna pizza. Everything there is great. The only disappointment I have is the service.  You can tell they are understaffed, but every server I have had was nice."}
{"text":"The best pho place ever! The service is good and place is perfect. It's a place to be if you want a really good soup.  Good job pho grill!"}
{"text":"I have only had pho at 3 different places, but I have to say this place has the best pho I have had. They're seafood is actually fresh, whereas, some of the other places, it's frozen seafood. I'm very pleased with this place. Also, great Thai tea and Vietnamese coffee! Must try! Love their pho, it is now the place I go to if I want pho!"}
{"text":"Yummy pho. Great quality and size Children's meal. Very clean restaurant with nice staff! We will be back again."}
{"text":"Had their chicken and shrimp Pho and it was delicious. The servers also have excellent customer service. If you guys are in the area, make sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Hmmm.. What is soft opening? Anyway I came in today and ordered their eggrolls and large pho. Reminder, eggrolls here are 4 dollars for only two rolls.. I agree with the user below stating that the meat was mystery meat. Not authentic at all. The vegetables given was inedible.. Why try so hard to make a plate pretty, I would have honestly would have wanted a plate full of lettuce than the random veggies given. I was also displeased with my eggrolls comming out soggy. It ain't hard to fully dry vegetables before putting it on the plate. On to the pho... It was just meh. Nothing special didn't taste authentic either... There large is like a medium. Another problem I had was how the restaurant tried so hard to be \"modern\" so modern that there weren't any silverware or napkins on the table.. I felt as if I had to constantly ask my server for things I needed. Then again it's a soft opening. Comming from a vietnamese person, the food is not authentic... Not that it's a problem... I rather go somewhere else with bad service and yummy food than a place with okay service and mediocre food. A soft opening is no excuse for meh pho and weird tasting eggrolls... Too pricey I might add. Hopefully next time around it will get better"}
{"text":"It's a cool little place we have been there few times and every time we were satisfied. They could do a better job on customer service, acknowledging customers and improving on sense of urgency but the food has been great every time. My girlfriend loves their soups and I have tried their sizzling teriyaki and I had to order it agin every time we went there !  The bathrooms were clean and there are good amount of parking lots."}
{"text":"Be sure to make note that this place is closed on Mondays!! I've been here maybe 3 times to try to give it a fair shot and I don't think I'll be going back again.  The service is super slow and they mix up and confuse orders. Prices seem a bit higher than average also."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since it opened and have seen much change over the years. My most recent visit was Friday 3/2/18 and the most noteworthy change was that it was the busiest I have ever seen it; a short line to get in and a wait to be seated in the dining room (I sat at the bar right away though). I understand why; the food is excellent. I had pho called Shrimp in a Clay Pot and it was one of the best things I have ever eaten, not only at Angelinas, but ever. The service is horrible though. The bar was full of people but no one was specifically working the bar, so nothing was bussed, it took forever to get acknowledged, drinks ordered, etc. They use their servers mainly in the dining room so the bar is generally neglected. If you have patience though, you will not be disappointed in the food. If Angelinas could nail down the service, this would be the best pho place in the Valley."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly and you could tell the waiters enjoy (or seem to enjoy, at least) their job however service was extremely slow.  Started with some Blue Point Oysters, nice and fresh. Super delicious! Fresh plate of basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, and sliced jalapeno's to add to my Seafood and Egg Noodle Pho with Alaskan Cod, New Zealand green mussels, shrimp, bok choy (broth was great).  I will continue to try new things here to see what I like. Fyi unless you have a huge appetite the medium pho is more than enough  Angelina's didn't disappoint. It was fast, straight to the point and authentic. The bathrooms were clean and there are good amount of parking out front.   Tip:  I understand the expansive menu but I would stick to the Vietnamese offerings, such as the spring rolls, they are done in a traditional way, with the freshness of mint (many have abandoned that in their rolls due to cost, not Angelina's!)  Check in and cash in on a free drink, also mention Yelp and they will take off 5%!   I'll definitely come back to see if service time improves.  You can follow K15 Adventures on Instagram and Facebook. See where we are headed next.  Typically, remote destinations where the journey of Fishing, Kayak Fishing, Hunting, Camping is the principal goal with, some shenanigans thrown in."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch.....get there early....cuz they fill up.   FAST!    spring rolls were to die for very FRESH, CLEAN TASTING.....chicken phoo.  Omg way to much food.  But so so great.   Can't wait to come back again.   Wish they had a lunch special.  Also THEY ARE HIRING.....so if u know some one that needs a job...PASS IT ON"}
{"text":"The food was Good,  had a wonderful meal and great service. The ambiance was relaxed and comfortable.  The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because I've been to amazing Vietnamese restaurants and this one didn't make my top 3. Would definitely recommend trying it out though"}
{"text":"Besides the wait, im always coming back here because they always have great food and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"BEST PHO IN ARIZONA!! BEST broth, all natural chicken, great crispy rolls, AWESOME happy hour. Staff is amazing (Jackson & Michelle) and owner Tom so personable!! I recommend Angelina's to any pho-aholic!!! We dine here usually twice a week or more... This place is clean, CLASSY, modern, no FOB zone. Very trendy, hip, with traditional amazing food."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.  There is a difference between a good chef who is technically competent and a cook who cooks with pure love in his heart.  I ordered the chicken dish and it came with soup, salad and jasmine rice.  I immediately regregretted not ordering a pho dish after the first whiff of the soup that came before my meal.  After tasting the soup I knew that this food was prepared with love in the heart.  After eating the chicken though I definitely was disappointed with my choice.  Angelinas is definitely on my short list of places to eat.  I cant wait to come back and try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"The biggest problem I have with this place is that I can never even look at the menu, I gotta have my pho. That's it. #1 or #6. The service is very friendly, Jackson is great. Plenty of parking. The place feels inviting and the decor is nice. I just wish I lived closer"}
{"text":"So we decided to use our groupon for this fairly new place which had a pretty nice decor. Unfortunately that was the only nice thing about this place. A crew of three was working as the waiting staff. Two guys and a young lady. The two men waited every table in the restaurant except ours before during and after we dined. The one young lady who did her best to wait on us gave no refills on water, forgot the iced coffee halfway through our meal, no garnishments for the pho, no plates with the appetizer, and brought a wrong dish out. We felt bad for our waitress and she was apologetic for her errors. She clearly was helping her coworkers from what we observed but neither would assist her. My bowl of pho was large and tasted ok. it was no different from what my mother usually makes. The tempura calamari was bland, greasy, and you could tell it was from a frozen food section. The salad served beside it was soggy which made the calamari soggy too. The best part of it was the dipping sauce served with it. The place was packed with Asians which seemed to get preferential treatment of prompt and friendly service from the staff and the owner. Another kicker is that I'm half Asian and understand the whole culture behind it but don't look a lick of it. This is not the first time I have gotten such service in an Asian owned eatery. Typical sign of \"We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone\" should also say if you don't look Caucasian or Asian. If you dont know the difference between a Chinese buffet and Vietnamese food then you might like this place but for me if I want my quality food I will just go to my moms place for dinner."}
{"text":"Well so far when I walked in the door a nice lady behind the bar told me that I could sit anywhere I like. I sat down and I am patiently waiting! I have had yet to be given a menu and have also not even been talked to by a server. People that walked in after me have already gotten drinks and food! Do I continue to sit and wait or do I call someone over?   So I decided to call someone over and had to basically yell across the restaurant. The waitress told me she'd send someone over. Either the hostess or a manager rushed over and brought me a menu and apologized. She also told me a discount would be applied to my meal. I was brought a soda quickly and my server came over shortly after that.  My pho came and it was delicious! They gave me 10% off my bill! It was a hazy start but clearly the ending was good!"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Prawn Clay Pot\" The noodles came out over-cooked. Also with a title Prawn you would think that would be the center of dish main attraction I got shrimps instead of prawns for all you seafood enthusiast out there would know the difference. I asked the sever why there was shrimp in here instead of prawns? He said he didn't know there were a difference C'mon mang!!!  Anyways my girlfriend ordered there pho again the noodles came out overcooked it practically broke once you grabbed it. We drove 30 min to try this place out definitely wasn't worth the drive even if I lived nearby I wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat a picky eater but I believe that if it's on a menu or if it's worth selling it's gotta be good to someone. My brother brought me here one day and I had gotten the Prawn in the Clay Pot. I love this soup. I've gotten it several times and will continue to get it.  This soup is a broth but it's also creamy if I'm describing it right. It's got fresh vegetables you can taste carrots Broccoli and baby corn as well as some shrimp and I believe are leeks but it's amazing always filling portions at very reasonable prices. Me, my family, friends, and co workers will be in back in."}
{"text":"I come from Europe. I live in Arizona for four years, where the food is terrible. We have tried hundreds of restaurants in the Phoenix area from cheap ones to extremely expensive, Angelina's is by far the best restaurant in Arizona. Everything in the menu is delicious and wonderfully prepared. Congratulations!"}
{"text":"Its nice to finally have a Vietnamese restaurant nearby.    This one is nice and clean, and it also has full bar complete with sake bombers.  Although I have not had a drink here yet,  its a nice option.  I do like the atmosphere they had created.  But unfortunately, what came with a nice and clean establishment is a pretty high price for Pho.  I had the Pho with rare beef several times now.   I have enjoyed my Pho every time, but my problem is the price.  A medium bowl is 8 dollars and a large is 9.  That is almost double most places I have been to.  My favorite place in the East valley has theirs priced at 4.50 for the same thing.  The positives about the Pho here is that they do have the lowest fat content in their meats, especially when I have it the next day; there is little fat accumulated at the top of the broth.  And it is pretty tasty.  Sadly there are only 3 options here for Pho, which is the smallest list of pho offerings I have seen at a Vietnamese restaurant.   I did have one of their beef appetizers,  the Bo Cuong Nuong.  I would recommend this as a must try, but the problem is the consistency.  The first time I had it, it was tender and oh so tasty.  The 2nd time it was a little tough but still good, and this last time it was like jerky, not dry, but really tough and hard to chew and not quite as tasty as before.  Service is friendly, but slow.  Sometimes VERY slow, even if hardly anyone is there.  I think this may be due to the kitchen staff and not the server themselves, I don't know.  But I tell ya, this is the longest I have had to wait ever for Pho when there was only 2 tables with a total of 4 people the afternoon I went.  I most likely will be back.  Mostly because of the convenient location.  When I figured the cost of gas to drive to a further one with a cheaper price and faster service, I would have paid the same amount in price AND my time spent at this location.  I have many high hopes for them to improve, especially in service."}
{"text":"Use to be a regular but found a better place at 43rd and Bell. Went back to this place to try it again, but was disappointed. The broth was way too sweet - very over powering.  My husband's was bland - felt like he was eating water with noodles.  To make it worse, the worker asked me if I wanted to take my food to go cause my baby was being a little whiney.  Pretty telling me indirectly to GTFO. Won't be coming here again.   Update: Because I gave an honest feedback, the owner wants me to go back to China and called me a horse? See uploaded photo.. Good or bad, take the feedback and improve - listen to your customers, thanks."}
{"text":"What a gem! Best pho I've ever had and the service was fantastic!!!!! Our waitress Evelyn  was very nice and great at her job. I asked her if the prawn pho was good and when she said it was amazing she did not exaggerate. The spicy coconut broth was perfect and the prawns were fresh. It was also loaded with veggies. Serving size was more than enough and the price point was fantastic. Million stars!"}
{"text":"Great pho place. Great ambience. Spotty service but generally good. :) Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Great services and the food taste so good!! The presentation of each plate are beautiful. Thanks to the chefs!"}
{"text":"The service was really casual and nice. I felt like I knew the lady though I didn't catch her name. Weird. I had the very last item on the menu, the vegetable crunchy noodle. it was AWESOME! I need to bring more people here."}
{"text":"Well I am currently sitting here still waiting after 15 minutes of asking for check. It has taken them all in all 1 hour from seating to checkout with maybe 2 minutes of service. Food okay but will not return here due to horrible service. Tip: don't use the bathrooms. Filthy!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best place for some fantastic Pho and Shrimp. There bang bang shrimp is by far one of the best I have had. (I'm not a big fan of shrimp.) It really does put the BANG into the shrimp! Looking for some great Vietnamese food? This is the place to go! Not only that, but the customer service is the best I have ever  experienced in a restaurant! Definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"I had a craving for pho and this place was down the road from my chiro appointment. Right place at the right time. I paid the dollar extra and got the big bowl of pho, which was a real challenge to get down it was so big. Delicious and packed with meat. I usually don't eat a lot of beef, but the slices are cut so thin and delicious in the pho that I like to kid myself it's different than eating a big steak. I think next time I'll get a version with more vegetables just to show how generous they were with their meats.   Very nice decor and different sections to sit at, including a bar and outdoor areas. I even got a free order of spring rolls (which I got to go because I was so stuffed) for checking in on Yelp. So don't say Yelp never did anything for you."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Celine Dion & R. Kelly - I'm Your Angel)  No sake too dry for you to try All you have to do is have an appetite, oh yeah No valley too far for you to make it across All you have to do is review it when you stay  And then you will see the noodles they serve And every dish will be tasty as they come Serve me some Pho cast them on me I just want you to eat  I'll have your eggrolls in a fly I'll have your Pad Thai just to try I'll try your Tartare when you make it At Angelina's    Angelina's is probably one of the best Americanize modern Vietnamese fusion restaurant I've experienced in the Phoenix valley!  I generally don't venture around on the Westside much so I had to Yelp around for a restaurant and found this little gem!  The decors are definitely Asian inspired and is a mix of all the major Asian cultures; Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean....etc.  A full bar with Sake, Sochu, and draft beer was apparent; totally dig the imports!  I sat at the bar stool since I was solo.  I had fun just reading the menu to see all fusion mix, but settled for the Beef Tartare and the Snow Crab Udon Noodle Soup.    The Chef came out to great me asking my nationality; as first I was confused, but later he explained that most Vietnamese guest that come in expect a certain type of Tartare, but his culinary education was French inspired so it was different.  I told him I don't have a preference and I only appreciate good food.  The Tartare was served like a raw hamburger patty with some Shrimp chips and some well-seasoned roasted mushrooms.  The capers atop provided a sour pungent bite as I spread the Tartare on top of the chips which of course gave it a crunchy texture to every piece I ate.  Overall, I enjoyed it very much!  The Snow Crab Udon noodle was next and this for me was another exploration dish.  The broth was extra thick like egg drop soup.  The beef was well infused in the broth giving it that extra flavorful taste while the udon noodles was slippery and slurpee making it a perfect noodle meal!  The chef came out with some house made hot sauce which added to make dish giving it a spicy punch!  I only added a little since I enjoy spicy, but not too much and boy was that sauce spicy!    Overall, service was great and food was tops.  The chef and staff provided me with extra attention maybe because I looked Vietnamese and I'm sure they were wondering what I would think.  I'm not picky nor would I ever complain about \"hey this ain't like mom's cooking\"!  Cause in the end, it isn't mom's cooking and it will never be, but expect to venture out of your comfort zone and be open minded! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am new to Pho so I decided to try it.  WOW, I ordered the seafood in the clay pot.  OMG, coconut soup with seafood, comes with noodles and salad to put in if you like.  This is so delicious, I could go there everyday."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here on Friday night and loved it. I had the Pho, chicken and shrimp and friend had the rib-eye. The Pho was excellent and the rib-eye as good as I can do at home.   We also had the shrimp appetizers and they were great! Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Food - 4 stars:  The pho here is pho-nomenol. My favorite is the #4 pho with brisket premium cut. The brisket is tender and flavorful. #3 pho with round steak cut is not too far behind, equally delicious, but not as fatty as the brisket. This place does not skimp on the quantity of meat. There is the perfect ratio of meat and beef noodle soup. I would dare say that there is more meat in the bowls than their competitors. The broth is rich in flavor and not oily. Since this is a pho place, I was hoping that they would have some Vietnamese words on the menu, like a small fine print that says pho tai for example. Nada. The pho runs on the pricey side. However, the quality of the food reflects the $$. I recommend getting the traditional crispy roll if you're planning on an appetizer - savory tasting and cleanly cut.      Service - 2 stars   The service here is a whammy. I had pho here back in 2014, and the service was horrendous. I went with a group of friends, and they brought out the wrong order for my friend. To remedy that mistake, he had to awkwardly wait an extra 20 minutes for his food to come out while the rest of the party was eating away...strike #1. In the old days, the broth was not up to par, and there was very little meat. The poor service and satisfactory food discouraged me from returning for 2 years. After seeing all the good reviews on yelp, I took the risk, being optimistic that major changes have been made. Fast forward to last week, we ordered two bowls of #3 pho with round steak cut. The server brought us two bowls of #4 pho with brisket premium cut instead...again the wrong order - strike #2. Not a big deal as the food was good, which is a pleasant improvement. However, today's visit was truly disappointing. We ordered the traditional crispy roll. My boyfriend told the server we wanted the CRISPY roll, and pointed at the menu. Our server did not repeat our order to us - something to consider in the future. She misheard it for something roll, and brought out the traditional roll. We politely told her it was the wrong order, and she curtly mumbled that we said TRADITIONAL roll when in reality we never said traditional and clearly said CRIPSY. Someone with great customer service would not argue with the customer. The waitress blamed us for her mistake, and did not even apologize as she took the traditional roll back inside in a disgruntled manner. Her mistake caused us to wait another 15 minutes for the correct appetizer to be out. We waited over 45 minutes for an appetizer without our pho yet. I totally understand that there has to be a wait for fresh food. We were in no rush, and patiently waited. Never once did she apologize for the wait! Even though the food is good, the irritable attitude is literally one door down rude, which ruined our mood. She made us feel as if we're a burden when we should be enjoying our meal. Yes, we were sitting in the patio that is requiring extra work for the waitress to bring our meal + hoisin/sriracha sauce outside. There is a patio for a reason. Do not make your customers feel unwelcomed and unwanted - strike #3. I gave this place three separate chances. Unfortunately, the shockingly poor service will not have me returning for the good food there."}
{"text":"Angelina's didn't disappoint. It was fast, straight to the point and authentic.  Why go there: You don't go there for the decor or atmosphere, there is better places for that, but the pho delivers. Their main star is surely Angelina's bowl, or #1.  Their brisket and other meat goodies in there were delicious.  The broth was clear and well seasoned, the bowls came with fresh ingredients like Thai basil, soya beans, cilantro and lime, ask for the oily chili sauce to go with it.    Tip: I understand the expansive menu but I would stick to the Vietnamese offerings, such as the spring rolls, they are done in a traditional way, with the freshness of mint (many have abandoned that in their rolls due to cost, not Angelina's!)  Check in and cash in on a free drink, also mention Yelp and they will take off 5%!"}
{"text":"I had the #2. Loved it. Tasted great. I received it quick when it was busy and it tatsed very fresh. But, the best thing was the service. Ask for Evelyn, she is the best server there. Great food, great atmosphere, and great service from Evelyn. Get the Pho'ck out of here that was good"}
{"text":"This place definitely fell into the \"I've had better\" category for pho. The spring rolls were decent, about what I'd expect. However, 4 spring rolls according to the menu turned out to be 2 spring rolls cut in half, which made me roll my eyes.The pho was ok but nothing special. It was tough to find an option that didn't include too many veggies that I don't like (mostly peppers), so I ended up with chicken breast pho with basic veggies. The chicken breast was on the dry, bland side although there was lots of it. Hubby had the pad thai and said it was about what he expected. Service was decent, we didn't have any of the issues other people have reported, the food was just underwhelming. There are definitely better places nearby at the same price point but with tastier food."}
{"text":"Love going to this place but........... every time we come here and eat , the food takes about 30 to 45 mins to get to you.  Regardless if they are having a busy night or when it's slow. If you eat here just know your gonna wait for your food for a very very long time. Your better off going to pho viet which is on 43rd on bell. And the service is horrible !!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! This restaurant gives a chance for hope!! Delicious, clean, great staff, amazing selection of food and sushi bar! Wish the hours were a bit later, but overall FIRE!!"}
{"text":"Service was slow. Waited for 45 mins and no food.  High End Vietnamese food, not worth the wait or the time. Find another place to eat."}
{"text":"Super delicious! This was my first time trying a Pho and let me tell you it was so flavorful! The chicken was super tender and the vegetables were just delicious.  I also loved the fact that we didn't have to wait such a long time for our food and the customer service was also espectacular. I will be coming back soon!   I definitely recommend Angelina's Pho & Grill Bar  ~Thanks for the amazing experience~"}
{"text":"I never like Pho restaurants but this one changed my mind about all Vietnamese food. The food is amazing here , service is very well and there's no long wait at all ever. I will continue coming here , keep up the good service."}
{"text":"AVOID at all costs!  The waitress that served us had the personality of a North Korean prison guard. The overall service was the poorest I had ever experienced.  The food was tasty, but took over 40 minutes to get to us..we're talking the soup took 40 min. It's too bad, the food was fresh and did taste good, but the experience is part of the deal too."}
{"text":"Came here two days in a row. Great food, generous portions and nice atmosphere. Menu is a mix of Asian cuisines. We tried black pepper beef, pad Thai, Pho and fried rice. All very good. Place is full for lunch and our server Brad is doing great."}
{"text":"The good: the pho here is excellent. The broth is good and well seasoned. The meats and noodles are good portions and everything is fresh.   The bad: the other things I've tried here haven't been so great. I've had the grill platter and the phad thai and neither were anything to rave about. The worst part about this place is the ULTRA SLOW. You can easily wait 30 Minutes for your food.....I have been here about 10 times because of the pho and good location but every time the slow service drives me absolutely crazy.   (This honest review is at the expense of a discount if you rate this place 5 stars.....a little yelp scam they have going on)"}
{"text":"One of the better Pho spots in Phoenix, Angelina's combines a high class appeal with great Pho and service.  I was very pleased at the Rare Steak Pho. The meat was very high quality and they brought lots of extras, including fresh cilantro and Italian Parsley. The size was enough to be filling, even at a medium. Noodles were tasty and the broth was pleasant.  The sunflower shrimp appetizer was amazing. Very good way to start the dinner. The green tea was full of spices and had a unique taste that made it very good to drink.  The ambiance was very classy. My waiter was professional, courteous, and respectful. She came to our table just often enough to be perfect.  Definitely will be coming here again."}
{"text":"I do have to say that this Pho restaurant is way better than the one I usually go to called Song Lynn. To start off, the place is so nice inside. Kind of caught me off guard because I felt like I should've dressed more fancy. Anyways, the waiter was very nice to us and I really liked that. I ordered a #3 (medium $8.50) and the portion was wow. They're very generous. Perfect amount of meat and rice noodles. The broth was great. One thing I didn't really like was that my sister had asked for egg noodles instead of rice noodles. We let our waiter know and he came back with the right kind of noodles. Unfortunately, the noodles were just too soft according to my sister. Nobody likes soggy noodles right? I mean other than that, everything was great and I will be back."}
{"text":"The service was prompt and excellent, and the food was absolutely delicious. The servers were professional and attended to us throughout our meal, and the food arrived so quickly. We had crispy egg roles and potstickers off of the happy hour menu to start. The egg rolls were so crispy and the potstickers were to die for. My girlfriend ordered the Bird Nest, which is a noodle and broth dish with chicken and vegetables and added a two dollar house soup which was so satisfying that she couldn't even begin her entre. I ordered beef pho, which had a delicious broth and a great amount of beef. We also had a sake bomb and a strawberry sake-tini, which were amazing! Due to happy hour, the sake-tini was only four dollars. All in all, it was a great experience.  Oh, and we also saw one of the servers save a child from falling off of a chair due to parental negligence. Awesome place to go for quality and affordable food. 5/5"}
{"text":"I used to live in Cali and Hawaii, and now moved to Arizona recently. Honestly, Angelina's beats any Pho restaurants that I visited. First, the big \"A\" from restaurant rating at the font door already wowed me before I stepped in and tried their food. Yes, indeed, they didn't disappoint me. Angelina's interior is well decorated with unique furniture and has cool design which impressed me at the first glance. Also, everything in Angelina's is clean and show the exceptional standard of a high level restaurant. Moreover, Angelina's has the professional service. For instance, I received a warm welcome and friendly smiles from every staff right away when I stepped in. Also, the server took order fast and checked my table frequently. Furthermore, since I love Pho, I ordered the special Pho and an order of spring rolls for appetizer. The rolls looked so good and were very fresh that made me decide to order one more. However, their Pho still impressed me most. When I sat in front of Angelina steaming bowl of Pho, I couldn't resist myself from the aromatic smell as well as its appealing look. After I squeezed some pieces of lime, added some basil, bean sprout, jalapeño, a little bit hoisin sauce and sriracha to my bowl, it became a stair taking me to heaven. When I took a little bit noodle with chopsticks, it satisfied every micrometer inside my mouth. Also, I was hypnotized by the amazing dance of tasty rare, brisket, tendon, meatball on my tongue and by the melody of fresh crunchy bean sprout when chewing. In addition, the healthy broth with the perfect combination of saltiness, sourness, sweetness and spiciness excited every nerve cells of my brain. Indeed, Angelina's Pho is delicious until the last drop of soup. Every cent is worth spending here since it gave me the best Pho with the professional service in fine setting. I will definitely come here every week. Cannot wait to visit Angelina's again. 5 stars!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not Vietnamese. Hell, I'm not even Asian. I dated a couple Asian girls once. Had to break up with Suki when I bought the Porsche because she got tired of sitting on Kimmy's lap. It was a two-seater.  What I'm saying is that I know what good Vietnamese food tastes like and they serve it here.   20% off appetizers before 7 pm makes it feel like you're stealing from these folks but they are cool with it."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw a Vietnamese restaurant going in close to my house.  There isn't a decent place to get Pho around here.  Angelina's is delicious!!!!! The inside of the restaurant is very nice, modern and very clean, the staff was friendly and the service was fast.  I ordered Rare beef Pho and it was great, the broth was fresh and full of flavor, the meat was the most tender beef I have ever had in pho and there was a generous helping of beef and noodles.  We had the calamari appetizer and my mom ordered the Crisp and Crunch Rolls AMAZING shrimp tempura, sweet potato, wild berry cream cheese so good I may go back tonight and order it for take home.  I would definitely recommend Angelina's Pho & Grill to any Pho lovers out there."}
{"text":"We had come here once before and had a good experience.  This past Saturday night, we were in the area and Pho sounded good.  Since we liked this place before, we were looking forward to coming back. Walking in the door, we waited a few minutes without being acknowledged. This was as about three staff members walked through the room and just ignored us. I was just about to leave when the girl in the Seahawks jersey acknowledged us from across the room with a \"what is it now?\" look on her face.  Practically rolling her eyes, she said \"two?\" and sat us without saying another word. No \"I'll be right back\" or anything at all. No glasses of water.  Nothing. We waited another few minutes with no service and just walked out. There are lots of other Pho options around that are more than willing to serve their customers, so we went elsewhere."}
{"text":"New to area and was looking for some Vietnamese food, having been to Vietnam and knowing what authentic Pho tastes like. Angelina's did not disappoint! Their selection of broth and meats was outstanding. My husband and I had different orders, and we were arguing which one was the best. We also ordered the traditional spring roll with the peanut sauce. Fantastic! Hannah, our server, was also adorable and provided quick and efficient service. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I work across the street and am not satisfied with the quality of the meat, and the fact that they consider a slice of fat meat. It also took them 20mins to realize that my preordered soup was not being made knowing that I only had a 30 min lunch. Still I did not feel valued as a customer especially considering the waste of my time. I will be working the rest of the day on an empty stomach.."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and they'e manage to annoy me both times. My boyfriend and I were pretty excited to have a pho restaurant near our home and have been waiting for them to open for over a month.  The day of their opening finally came but we learned that they completely ran out of food by late afternoon. We came in the next afternoon but more than half the items on the menu were gone. They ran out of food the previous day, why were they not more prepare the next day? We ended up getting the Bad Thai (yes, that's what it's called)  and the last steak Montreal. The steak was suppose to come with jasmine rice but they ran out of that as well even though there's an asian supermarket a few doors down!   Putting everything aside, both dishes were excellent and the portion was huge but we know that's due to them trying to gain loyal customers and it will only go downhill from here. The server told us that the owner apologize for the lack of menu items and that they'll give us $10 off our next visit. It would have been more meaningful if the owners came to us themselves instead of chatting with the big, loud table that (probably took all of the food) was clearly her relatives.  Fast forward 1 week: We thought that we gave them enough time to settle down and work out the kinks but found ourselves to be very wrong. Their signature items were not available (#4 pho and filet mignon) and their excuse was that it's a soft opening. On top of that, they also don't have my Montreal Steak. When I ask our server about certain items on the menu she have no idea what they are. Fed up, I got the beef appetizer. My BF ordered his Bad Thai again because he wanted to eat as much of it as he can before they shrink the portion and don't make it as well....well...too late! The portion is ok (but noticeably smaller compared to last time) but the dish taste completely different! It's plain, the noodles were clumpy, the chicken was sweet for some reason, and the bell pepper (there were no bell pepper last time) was raw. We couldn't finish half of it. We just ended up ordering another beef appetizer which was pretty good.  Overall: The servers were very inexperience, the food took a very long time to come out (twice the time it takes to eat) and the check took almost as long as the food, and their food is very inconsistent. Each time I was very annoy with their limited dish. The owner don't know how to run a restaurant because all I see are young servers running around lost and confuse trying to right the many orders they mess up on. I don't think I will come back anytime soon. If they are still around 6 months from now, I might give them another shot.  I gave them 2 starts instead of 1 because even though the servers were bad at their job, they try hard to right their mistakes. Also, for the food being good half of the time."}
{"text":"Terrible Staff. I walked in for a take out order and they made me just stand there. No eye contact, no menu, no hello....terrible absolutely terrible"}
{"text":"My friend had heard good reviews of this place.  She had never tried pho and was curious.  We were greeted and quickly seated during the lunch hour.  There was a good crowd of people.  We both ordered #7, Chicken Pho, medium orders.  The order came relatively quickly.  The fragrance from the soup was nice.  I showed my friend the picking of the basil leaves, bean sprouts and lime juice.  I passed on the jalapeño and added Sriracha and hoisin sauce instead.  The soup was clear and tasty.  The chicken breast meat was fresh and tender.  The noodles were perfect.  No water refills were offered and our server took some time getting the bill to us as we sat. She should have checked on us at least once.  In any event, it was a nice experience.  The place is clean and roomy.  Plenty of parking in this strip mall and you can do some Asian grocery shopping afterwards.  The menu is a little more pricey than most Vietnamese places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love the pho here and the establishment is very cool! I feel lucky to have this so close to my home!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I have dined at Angelina's three times now. On two occasions, we shared the large Special Angelina's Pho. The last time we went we tried the Spicy Angelina's Lover. Both are fabulous, but I think we will order the spicy from now on! The  kitchen graciously splits it into two bowls without us asking, and provides plenty of ingredients (meat, sprouts, noodles, etc.) for the two of us. The service is good, and the price of pho is extremely reasonable for the amount served. I can't comment on their other dishes, as the only other thing we have tried are the crispy veggie rolls which were good, but not great. We will be returning to Angelina's again for another pho fix!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding!  All of the noodles in broth is to die for.  Have been here several times, food is always outstanding, service is very very good. Will continue to take my friends and family here. Cannot wait to try other dishes, they all look good."}
{"text":"I still visit Angelina's regularly and the food is still great!  Unlike others, I have not experienced inconsistencies, except when we try to order desserts and they are never available.  For a while there they had some really good servers but I haven't seen them around lately.  There are a few new people that while nice, either need more experience or some help.    The wait staff really need a busser for busy hours and/or training on how to pre-bus tables.  Some people come in and there are only dirty tables and they have to sit at them and wait and the server may or may not clean the table for them.    There doesn't seem to be a front of the house manager working here and is still the missing key to this place being really successful (and in fact could be its undoing)."}
{"text":"I came back a few weeks ago and had a much better experience.   For a Sunday night they were pretty busy but we were seated quickly, the (new) waitresses were very friendly, polite, and despite running out of the thai tea my boyfriend is obsessed with, we still enjoyed the food (I recommend the charbroiled pork plate. Portions are large, the pork is tender, and the salad goes along with it perfectly.)   The establishment has definitely stepped it up and seems to be responsive to the needs of their customers. Recommended."}
{"text":"So nice inside. Service was great and the food was awesome. A medium pho plate is huge so me and my husband split one large every time we go. I will definitely comeback."}
{"text":"We did an order to go the other night. I love pho and Angelina's makes a wonderful flavorful broth for the pho. I got a # for my husband and I to share we even got it to go. It was happy hour and we even got the fried coconut shrimp. Holy moly they were amazing best dipping sauce soooo tangy and full of flavor . We will be coming back to actually sit down and enjoy more pho and other things on the menu"}
{"text":"Angelina's is one of those restaurants you dine in when you want more than just good food...you want better health & a boosted spirit! My husband & I love this place mainly because the food is insanely fresh! The salmon, the filet mignon, the shrimp all fantastic! The vegetables & rice even more amazing! The servers aren't the buggy type respecting the company you are with. The hot sake is yummy & their sauces are deliciously unique! Enjoy this location for a special lunch or dinner. We even celebrated Christmas Eve here this year...making a wonderful evening for our family."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite place to eat Pho! I've been to many Vietnamese restaurants and this one is the best!  Service is always great, the atmosphere is wonderful, and nothing on the menu will disappoint you.    Make sure you come hungry! The portions for Pho are big. My favorite Pho is the #9, Tonkanoise. Lots of beef flank steak, full of mixed veggies, absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff - we had Evelyn as our server and she was very nice and honest about what is good on the menu which I like! We had the bang bang shrimp and pho. The broth of the pho was really good and very authentic and we loved the bang bang shrimp! Definitely will be back, glad we finally found a good Vietnamese place in Glendale"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. We had a part of six. We were greeted with a smile and seated promptly. The server handled 2 separate bills flawlessly as well as all 6 orders. She also readily refreshed our drinks without having to ask.  I would definitely recommend and return when we are in the area. If you haven't already tried this place, give it a shot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The best pho in the west valley! I always get the beef brisket pho, and for appetizer I get the tofu stack. Yum! I love how the pho has the option of medium or large. Most pho restaurants have one size. The staff are really nice and the restaurant is clean and spacious. I will be honest; sometimes it takes too long for our food, or too long for our check or for them to come back for our check. But I know the servers are all friendly. This is my go-to pho restaurant on the west side!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once when they first opened, and once last week.   Food-great! I've tried several of their dishes like curry, spicy pho, seafood pho, some steak..It's good! The pho comes in medium and large sizes, the medium are usually $8-9, and it's a big huge portion! I wanted to try their sushi but they didn't give us a sushi menu and by the time we got the chance for one we just wanted to order our food.   Service-Meh. Walked in, was not greeted. Waited until someone finally came by and sat us. They seem shorthanded, but doesn't mean they can't deliver great service. I don't mind waiting as long as you say things like, \"Sorry about the wait!\" \"How's everyone today?\" Well, I minded because our waiter didn't do any of that. The other waiter, who later brought us the food, seemed much better. I think our experience would of been much better.  Anyways, I normally go to Vietnamese places for pho, and I can definitely find cheaper, legitimate, and more delicious pho somewhere else. This place does have a great ambiance though! Great for a nicer sit down restaurant and a menu with a bigger variety."}
{"text":"Upbeat lively atmosphere with a huge bar and good size bar area to enjoy happy hour.   There is a nicely sized dining area attached that doesn't leave you feeling secluded away and separate from the main area.   I ate: edamame, spring rolls, crispy rolls, chicken and veggie pho and tasted the regular chicken pho.  I drank: Pepsi (free thanks to my Yelp check-in)  Pros: Friendly and patient service (they worked well as a team.). Appetizers looked and tasted freshly prepared although the Edamame may of been a little over steamed.  The broth in the pho was flavorful and one of the best I've tasted recently.  That combined with the grilled chicken that was used made for a great bowl of pho!  Clean restrooms.  Cons: Appetizer came out a little bit slow and the main dishes arrived very shortly afterwards. (But the restaurant was very busy at the time I ordered.)  I will definitely return and have a few drinks next time (I had to pass because I was working).  Their full bar impressed me and they were even giving away Sake tastings (not sure if that's a regular event).  Good food, causal, nice atmosphere, glad I tried out Angelina's."}
{"text":"Best place for pho in Az.  Great atmosphere with a hip modern/contempo style, good service, very clean.  Everything I have ordered or my friends have ordered is delish ! Now they serve sushi too so that's a plus. I totally recommend the bbq spring rolls or jalapeño poppers (if you like a spicy kick) . Ask for Brad, awesome server."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've had in Phoenix so far and the grill section is amazing. The ingredients are fresh and they know what they're doing. The bar is also a good place for an after work meetup with friends."}
{"text":"I liked Angelinas. It was really nice inside. I was surprised. We went on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded.  I liked their high chair there. It had a big tray that I could put the baby's food on so she could eat. It made the experience even more enjoyable.  All 3 of us ordered pho. What I did not like was the limited amount of pho on the menu. I had to tell the waiter I wanted tofu and vegetable pho. There was no vegetarian option on the menu. There was also a lot of different broths which made it more complicated. My dining friends both got chicken pho. We also ordered 2 appetizers- a salmon roll with cream cheese, and spring rolls.  The salmon rolls were so good. We all enjoyed them. They were super tasty. I did not try the spring roll but my mom ate it all and said they were good.  The pho came out and it was piping hot, so it took a while to eat. It was really good though. A little too many vegetables in mine which made it hard to eat. They tempura fried the tofu and it was delicious but fell apart a little easily. My family enjoyed their chicken pho, but my Aunt was disappointed she did not have any veggies in hers. Only meat and the stuff you add in. I had to give her some of my vegetables.  The people there were really nice. They laughed at what a mess my baby made so that was good. The owner came out and talked to my aunt and gave her a hug.   Overall it was a good experience and I will be back. Hopefully they put a vegetarian option for the pho. Also it was expensive pho too, so that is why it is not 5 stars"}
{"text":"Best restaurant by far in the Glendale area. Has a true local vibe and the waitstaff is outgoing! They appreciate you as a diner and the food is amazing. I recommend the Bang Bang Shrimp, BBQ Flank Steak or Chicken."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, haven't been their since they opened their Sushi but will be going next weekend for that! All in all it great food, great service just very small and has only one single bathroom."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant 4 times so far - The pho is generally really good. I have found their broth to be consistent, the stock tastes like it was made versus canned.  The side vegetables, bean sprouts, limes, jalapenos are all fresh and yummy. I prefer to have chicken pho for the most part, and theirs so far has been great every time.   We have had a few appetizers on occasion but a large pho is plenty for me. The restaurant is always very clean. BangBang shrimp is something else for an appetizer, I don't think you'd ever get anything like that in Vietnam, still pretty tasty!   They do get busy though, and I think they must have a lot of turnover in wait staff because I have never been served by the same person on subsequent visits. Not that they are bad, just new and some seem to have no understanding of the food they serve. I like Angelina's - They are worth the drive for us so far and I hope that the food continues to taste as good as it does."}
{"text":"Wife and I visited tonight and both had the number 8 (chicken and shrimp pha) and hot spring rolls (3 to order). Wife loved her Pho on her first visit.  Female server was awesome and hope to get her again.  Went around 8 pm and there was about 5 or 6 tables filled.  Cant wait to try their fresh oysters next time."}
{"text":"I came for lunch with my family and I have kids to so its great they have a kids menu I think it was 4.99 we got the shrimp tempura with jasmine rice and it comes with a drink and as for the adults we got the rare meat pho soup it was amazing great taste not sweet and it was enough good amount in it we got lrg it was like 9$ I paid like 27$ our server was really nice and helpful. its a nice place looks trendy . I will be returning soon and because the meats are usda and natual .and they have a bar that serve beer and wine."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick lunch. Fast service, flavorful pho for only $9. Staff is always attentive, and I've never had a bad experience here. Definitely nice to have something like this close by to work when you want to fill up on yummy food for cheap."}
{"text":"Went out for dinner with my parents here and we were all very pleased with this restaurant.  The decor is modern and the ambiance is welcoming. Having a clean Vietnamese restaurant can be rare, but it was extremely clean here.  The food was cooked to perfection. They bring traditional Vietnamese food to another level by adding heir special flavors and being creative in combining ingredients that I wouldn't have imagined. We had the BBQ spring rolls, steak Montreal style, Pad Thai, Lotus shredded and shrimp. All of these were really tasty and I'd order them again.  They even have a bar with specialty cocktails which is a nice thing to have in Glendale! I need to try their happy hour sometime, as I noticed a sign about this.  Very pleased with my visit here, and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Loved it! Perfect for when you are looking for great soup. Will definitely be returning all the time!"}
{"text":"Hubby & I were wanting to stay close to home , but something other than wings or BBQ & decided it was time to try Angelina's!- Always wanted to try, everytime I stop in at the UPS store( next door). We got in early on Friday, great seats and atmosphere was low key. Had cocktails, spring rolls& spicy calamari to start...yum! Ordered Saki bombers,noodles, Pad Thai dish & Snowcrab dish...wow! I had to take half if mine home.Our server,Lee was so helpful in demonstrating how to use the chopsticks to get the udon noodles on the spoon for best consumption!! All was great.We will certainly be back!!- thank you for a nice surprise in our neighborhood : )"}
{"text":"Favorite Pho place in town! We enjoy sitting at the bar. I love the Tokyo Mule, It's a great drink. My husband usually gets their large spicey bowl and I get chicken pho. They also have really good appetizers."}
{"text":"I'm a Pho guy! this is where I go for my crave! I have recommended so many of my friends to come here, most are Americans who pronounce \"FO\" not \"FUH\" lol !! none of them tell me that they dont like it but get hooked right the way! i love vietnamese food and i alway try to \"advertise\" vietnamese food any chance i get! and this is where im proud to send my friends to! cant go wrong! good food + clean + professional + polite = rock!!!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. It is not authentic or good at all in fact its absolutley disgusting. Mini corn in the curry was rancid, Teriyaki did not resemble nor taste like teriyaki, and Pho was gross. It took 45 minutes for us to be served with food and forever if we needed drinks. They forgot noodles and veggies for Pho and rice for our curry/teriyaki. When they did bring it they brought an extra one and then we watched them serve it to somebody else.. Which in my opinion is pretty disgusting. The service was bad too as everything else it took forever and they were downright rude and had nasty looks on their faces. And they have steak, tempura, and pho. It is a mixed menu there is no theme and everything but the eggrolls we ordered was disgusting. For all those good reviews out there we must of missed something, or you havent tried real good Vietnamese food. Or the other cultures food they decided to  mix in (Japan)"}
{"text":"Just got remodeled not too long ago. Had a groupon (of course who doesn't now -a-days)  Well anyways, Pho here is good, good noodle to meat ratio, (which you would be surprised isn't all about the meat for me). The \"Large\" didn't seem to be that big of a bowl, but the amount of food inside was definitely a large portion.  The spring roll was good, the wrap was not dried out anywhere , peanut sauce was well balanced, nothing overboard.   This is a great alternative to going down south to Tempe/Chandler area."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best Viet food I've ever had. When they first opened, they were a little iffy but I decided to give them another chance and I'm so glad I did!! The Pho is perfect. I like the chicken or the spicy one. The meat is perfectly cooked. Also for appetizers I recommend the spring rolls with chicken inside or fried rolls (comes with pork inside). Also, the drinks are good too. They always seem to have drink specials so bottoms up! Also, the Thai tea is nice. I don't usually order Thai tea from non-Thai restaurants but I'm happy I did. So good!! My mouth is watering writing this review and I'm not even hungry."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Jackson was our server/bartender... We had the steak spring rolls and the bang bang shrimp...wow!! We will be back! Cool music and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We've only had food here once. Their combination meat platter and fried rice were both decent. Service here, however, isn't very good. This is a common problem with a lot of Vietnamese restaurants. They can get quite busy on the weekends due to their sushi bar/pho restaurant hybrid concept they're going for. As a result, food can often take a ridiculously long amount of time, with no apologies given for the subpar service. I do give them credit for simplifying their menu, as many Vietnamese places offer far too many dishes to the point where you often end up feeling overwhelmed.  Their Thai Tea, which is a favorite drink of ours, is an absolute disgrace. It's watered down and tastes like it was pre-mixed in a giant pitcher - although I cannot confirm this.  If you venture a little further east to 43rd and Bell, there's a restaurant over that that serves food that's equally as good, far superior Thai Tea, and slightly better overall service.   I'm glad they're not the only game in town, because we've had far more success at other places when searching for this type of food."}
{"text":"The business hour listed they close at 10 on friday. We came in around 9:30 and told us they were close. Even so, at least offer to let us make to-go order. Please change your business hour, this is very frustrating because I had to drive 20 mins for this."}
{"text":"I'd like to give 2.5 stars but we'll round to 2 in this case.    Atmosphere - nice, modern, clean.  Bar offset.  Outside tables.  I sat inside non-bar side.  Never used the bathroom so no comment there.   As an aside, being my first review, from here forward - I'll always check out the restrooms.   Much can be gleaned from their condition.   {Any good manager will have a restroom once-over completed every 45 minutes during peak hours.  A 'top tier' manager will do this every 25 minutes.}    Drinks - had a bottled IPA which was very strong and cold.  Also had a 'sake bomber' with a large Tiger ale type beer - think around $5 not a bad deal.  The sake was warmed and (not being a connoisseur) tasted like clear sake probably should.     Appetizers - a 'fried' tofu platter with eggplant - hey, this was simply great.  Not real big, just right a few bites to compliment a drink and conversation.   Main Course - Pho - rare brisket, fried rice with shrimp - and a vegetable pho.   All of it very good, plenty of ginger accent on the brisket pho, rice noodles cooked perfectly.  So much food, though, couldn't eat it all.  Nobody starves at this place. We didn't take any home so no comment on leftover redemption.   Price - Not bad, typical, nothing really overly cheap or pricey.  Service - good. Nothing special, but expectations met.     The BIG question - Would I return? :  Yes Secondary BIG question - Why not 5 stars?:  No big reasons.  I can't hand out 5 stars easily.   I think this one needed some ambiance music.   Also - windows - we have to get and keep the front windows and doors clean - that's a biggie and it's easy.     So, there you go.  Good place overall, we'll be back."}
{"text":"A friend had gone here a week ago and posted a beautiful picture of his Pho on Facebook, with a good review so I decided I would venture in and check it out. I have only had Vietnamese food once before so I was ready for a second shot.  I started with their Traditional Roll which comes with a great peanut sauce. It was fresh and light and the flavor was very pleasing.  I showed the server the picture my friend posted and she identified it as their Tonkinoise Pho. I cant say enough how much I enjoyed it. The veggies, meat, noodles, and broth were very pleasing.  The prices were good, the servers were friendly, it took a bit of time to get my soup but they were very busy and the end result outweighed any rush i might have felt. All in all a very good experience.  I hemmed and hawed between four and five stars, but left room that the next visit will be even better."}
{"text":"I didn't give a full five star review purely because of the service. It's 50/50 here. I always get the #15, (prawns in a clay pot with coconut broth). Very delicious! However, I asked the server for no onions, yet he placed my pho in front of me saying, \"prawns with no onion\" when there was a pile of onions on the top...? Did he just not care or does he not know what an onion is? It was really annoying picking out all the pieces on onions. Still delicious though! Sometimes I get my pho prepared differently than the time before. For example, sometimes the shrimp still has the tail on it and sometimes it doesn't. Not very consistent. We come here for the food but not the service."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely horrible here. I took my mother here on Mother's Day and they only brought her food out. Myself and my girlfriend did not get our food until about 45 minutes later. By that time my mom was already done eating. When they brought the food to us it was put it in to go containers because they were closing. It took me asking two different waitresses to get the manager before he showed up. His excuse was that it was a long day, yet they only had three tables when we were there. Then waitress acted bothered when bringing us our food and check. Needless to say we will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Food is good.  If you sit at the bar you won't get good service at all.  We ended up leaving after sitting at the bar for over 5 minutes and were completely ignored. If you go get a table."}
{"text":"I moved from Los Angeles about a year ago and had high expectations when it came to Vietnamese cuisine. I had tried several disappointing alternatives until I finally landed on this gem. The staff are very nice and attentive, the atmosphere is very welcoming and stimulating (good music playing). I have been around the world and have had what I consider the best calamari here. My personal favorites are the Pho Thai (rare beef) and the Chicken Pho (forget what it's called). I am very happy that I can I have the same quality of food that I had in Los Angeles right here in Phoenix. I would recommend to anyone and everyone especially locals! Bring your friends and tell friends, the staff are super charming, not the typical (stick up arse).  My only regret is that it's not closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Was in the are and in the mood for Pho so decided to see what was around and was pleasantly surprised. Very nice atmosphere. It was lunch time and very busy. We were greeted right away and seated immediately. We ordered ahi tuna roll and chicken and shrimp Pho as well as pad tei . It was so amazing.\"My so had the grilled chicken and rice and finished the whole plate. Definitely the best Pho out of all the places I've stopped so far."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. The food was exceptional! I've only had Pho once before, so I'm not an expert, but I do know good food and this was amazing. I had the spicy Pho, #6. I will say that I am accustomed to very spicy dishes and this one had my nose running in two bites. Very flavorful with the accompaniment of garnishes made this dish taste better than I could've imagined. The staff is friendly and attentive. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm going to update my initial 3 star rating. The food is really excellent. I love the Pho and my wife tried a chicken grill mix plate which was awesome. I still complain that the Pho is too expensive but we have countered it with the recent Groupons they offered. I keep saying if prices were a little lower, at least a few dollars cheaper on the Pho, I would be here at least once a week. As it is now ill come hopefully once a month at best.  Overall I really hope this place stays in business and keeps on going."}
{"text":"This was our first dine in experience. The food to go is always outstanding. Service was slow even though it was late afternoon. Prawn in a clay pot was super spicy which is not normal. The lemongrass chicken was missing the shrimp we ordered and the flavor was bland. The crispy rolls were good. I am sure we hit an off night. The food to go is always delicious."}
{"text":"Went here a couple days ago because I love PHO, the food was really good however the service was AWFUL!  I stood to be seated for about 5-10 min, it was a Sunday night and not very busy. They sat me down, and waited 15 min before anyone even took my drink order, another 15 just to bring it to me. When I finally ordered my food it came out really fast and was delicious. However I had to get up and ask for utensils, and the extra sides to my PHO. Because when the waiter brought my food they just brought it and left never asked if I needed anything.  After they dropped off my food they never came back to my table to refill our drinks or check on us. Sat 20 min after we were done eating, I had to get up and ask for the waiter to bring my check,. I waited another 20 min for them to come back to take my card I got so fed up I just paid cash left it on the table and left. it was not very busy at all maybe 6 tables while I was in there.  unfortunately the food wont bring me back, because of my experience. There is another pho place just down the street."}
{"text":"We had a group of eight and everyone was very happy with their meals. Fabulous soups- creamy salmon Dill soup,  noodle soup served with the grilled seafood and meats, and the pho!!!!  Great service. Ended our meal with fried bananas with coconut pineapple ice cream and chocolate mousse! My new favorite and I will be a regular!"}
{"text":"We love this place and eat there about once a month! Awesome summer rolls, pho, and other great dishes! I love the deluxe brisket pho! Enjoy this great restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pho Angelina 3 times but only because I had purchased Groupons that have allowed me to go. The food is decent as far as Pho places go, the ambiance of the restaurant was very nice compared to typical Phos. The prices were on average 30% more though for each plate.   Its hard to give such a terrible rating to a place with so many positives but the service there was absolutely terrible, frustrating and or the worst service i've seen at a restaurant outside my little nephews playing hamburger stand in the backyard.   Each time I went I waited about 5 minutes just to be acknowledged. From being seated it would take a ridiculous amount of time to have my order taken. From there consistently dishes would take forever to come out and not even in the proper order (IE: I'd get an entree then 20 minutes later i'd get my appetizer).   With my last Groupon I decided to time my whole experience to really be able to help people get a sense of the terrible service.   Last Sunday I went in and I waited 3 minutes to be seated, 11 minutes to be acknowledged where I was sitting. My entree came in at the 26 minute mark. My first appetizer came 9 minutes after. My last appetizer came in about 15 minutes after I was done eating everything else. (Literal numbers no exaggeration)  What bothers me isn't that the restaurant was so busy that the staff couldn't handle the load but more that they were either too lazy to pay attention or incompetent to the point where they didn't know what they were doing.   That night there were 3 servers. One (short asian guy on the bar side of the room) would be texting on his phone, talking to his group of friends seated nearby, and generally not paying attention. Theres a big darker skinned asian guy who took 10 minutes to make a drink, while ignoring my waves for attention, and 4 phone calls to the restaurant literally 3 feet away from him. He then took maybe 5 minutes to put an order into the computer. In the total hour I was there he accomplished maybe 4 tasks.   Lastly, I once had a take out order, which they messed up and gave me the wrong thing. The next time I went back and asked if theres anything they could do about it they told me I should have checked it before I left and too bad.   I absolutely do not recommend this place. I hope people will listen to this review to save themselves a bad experience."}
{"text":"I just got home from my first visit to Angelina's.... DAMN! That was amazing to say the least. The BBQ beef spring roll ia a must have, the peanut sauce was the best I have ever had. Everybody in my party agreed that this was the best Vietnamese in town. Our waitress Heather (call her Suzie, she will answer to anything) was delightful and very entertaining. I had the Chef's Special with Shrimp, flat Iron steak and Pork. The Pork was incredible, I think I will have Heather serve it with the vermacelli next time. Try this place out, I promise you will not regret it. On a side note to Mark M. who complained about the servers wearing  short skirts, the rest of us will never be allowed to judge for ourselves. Management has now banned all skirts. Mark, please revise your review and management, please bring the skirts back!"}
{"text":"My family has visited this restaurant several times. The service is very good and the food is also very delicious. The pork I usually order is good and the portion is quite large, however it's not the best thing I've ever ate. It's not the most authentic Vietnamese food, but I'll still recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"1st time having pho it was delicious. I got the spicy seafood ceramic dish. Only con was it took forever for the food to come and it wasnt like they were busy."}
{"text":"We discovered Angelina's by accident and we were amazed by the food and service. We love pho and found theirs to be the best we've had. We are here for the second time and I have a pad Thai and it was wonderful. Can't wait to come back and have more wonderful food !"}
{"text":"I frequent this establishment often. I have taken family and clients there and those folks are now Angelina lovers. I usually get Shrimp in clay pot and a server told me to take the extra broth home and pour it ovrr rice. The flavor is awesome and I was excited to have another taste of this wonderful broth the NE t day. . I must say, this is the best Pho I have had."}
{"text":"Bad from the start: We walked in and it was busy so we waited. Finally, I asked the sushi chef if we were supposed to seat ourselves and he said to go ahead.  We walked into the other side of the dining room and it was full of patrons and dirty dishes - there was no where to sit.  They cleared a table just as we were about to leave. We ordered an appetizer and it was tasty. Entrees were bland and the service was horrible. We probably will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times now and have always had a good experience! My first time there was on my birthday in June and Alex hooked me up!! He mentioned and recommended sushi I've never had before and it was amazing! Spicy angelina pho is super good too. Oh yeah, and I LOVE their pickled pear martini!!!!  Returning customer for sure!!!"}
{"text":"At least once a week I get the craving for the delicious prawn Pho dish at Angelina's and their wonderful fresh spring rolls.  Each time I go I am greeted with a smile by the staff and the service is excellent. The food is consistently great quality and super tasty! I highly recommend this restaurant and will continue to dine here."}
{"text":"This is one of the tastiest Pho places in the greater Phoenix area! I have gone to many different restaurants and this bowl of Pho is absolutely delish!! I would suggest not coming at the busier times due to the servers not being able to handle the quantity of people and showing frustration in their faces but that is probably the only downfall. Every other Pho restaurant I have been to is good but they never put enough meat in the soups which is a huge pet peeve of mine. Im basically a carnivore and love as much as I can get. Angelina's has the perfect amount of meat in their precious bowl of Pho which makes my meat loving taste buds melt into bliss. I highly suggest Angelina's to anyone who has been looking for a tasty bowl of Pho or spring rolls (which are soooo good)!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the good phö spots in North Phoenix! Sorry for the missing pic of the pho we devoured it! They undoubtedly care about how Theo food and drinks taste. Well presented, and you can taste the love! We ordered beef phö, teriyaki grilled salmon, and shrimp fried rice! Teriyaki salmon was amazing! Came out sizzling to perfection! My wife loved her shrimp fried rice! And we all shared the phö as it was so good! My daughter practically drank her Thai tea in one drink because it was so good. Overall come check it, oh and they have a full bar with football on so no complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"This restaurant is weird. A mix of Vietnamese, Thai, Japanese, etc... The dishes aren't 100% authentic. And prices are a little on the higher side for the typical Vietnamese dishes.  Anyway, a lot of the entrees we wanted were not available. I wanted the Ahi tuna pizza. Waiter said they didn't have it. I asked if they could substitute the ahi tuni with salmon or something else... the answer was no (which I understand). Tried to get an entree I saw on a yelp image... but they \"don't serve it anymore\". Tried to order a different one from yelp images.... but they \"don't make it anymore.\" Many of the images of entrees on this yelp page are not available anymore.  So, we ended up ordering the vermicelli dish (~$11) and the pad thai. Both were decent (3/5 max) However, the vermicelli didn't come with enough noodles. The egg rolls are good though and I would come back just for the egg rolls.... but everything else is ehh whatever... The pad thai was okay... I had better. It wasn't too spicy, had a decent amount of spiciness for my taste (I can't handle a lot of spice). On a positive note, they put a nice amount of meat/shrimp/vegetables in the pad thai.  We may come back once in a great while just to be nosy."}
{"text":"I have recently moved to Arizona for grad school and have been on the hunt for good Vietnamese food. My dad and I decided to try out Angelina's because it is fairly close to my apartment and to school. The interior is cute and very comfortable. We each decided on our own bowls of pho and started on a raw beef appetizer. I was excited about this appetizer because there's a Vietnamese/Chinese dish where you take raw slices of beef and soak it in lemon juice, onions, chilies, what have you. The acid from the lemon will eventually cook the beef just enough so that it is edible and delicious but still a bit pink. I thought that this appetizer was like that dish. It wasn't.  Instead, a meat ball made of raw ground beef came out with shrimp crackers. Not terrible, but not what I was expecting. This item is either very new or nobody ever orders it because my dad saw the chef/owner/whoever run out to buy something from the store which turned out to be an ingredient for our appetizer. Odd. Also, the pho wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. It was lackluster at best. I think there was just a bit too much star anise in the broth that was somewhat overpowering.  Having grown up with homemade pho and being spoiled in Southern California with all the good Vietnamese restaurants, Angelina's really isn't incredibly bad; it just isn't good either. Probably won't be making a return trip unless I'm desperate for pho and am too lazy to drive far. Then again, the $9 price tag attached to a bowl may just convince me otherwise. 2.5 stars for Angelina's!"}
{"text":"This place definitely has a great atmosphere good service and good people. I will continually come back here as often as I can. I hope my friends here come and enjoy some Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I am giving them an extra star, for this being a soft opening all you people should be a little big more lenient, i have had way worse that do not deserve a 1 star rating.. so yeah..  i like that with a rice plate combination they give you a small bowl of pho with it.. very nice touch.  food is pretty good, but with that being said, i will not go back until they have some time to settle in."}
{"text":"Excellent house cocktails, best mojito ever. Excellent prices and portions.  I am vegetarian, so I have tried all those options. Every single thing has been delicious.   It's in a strip mall, but don't let that turn you off. It is actually kinda cool in there. It's a smallish place but it's got a bar and nice, clean decor.   The staff is great."}
{"text":"Just had dinner for my husbands birthday and we all loved it. A great atmosphere and the food was amazing. Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"First time here visiting family in the area. The food was decent. Expensive though. Not only that we had a party of 5 people and they automatically added 18% tip on top of the bill. We are from Boston and none of the Vietnamese restaurants around here automatically add tips in even if it's 10 people or more. Not only that but these guys added the 18% tips on top of the total that included tax. So I am essentially tipping them on the sales tax amount too. I had family with me so I did not want to make a stint out of it but we will never visit this place again when we visit family in the Phoenix area. I am giving 2 stars because the staff was pretty nice and friendly."}
{"text":"A gem in the West Valley. The menu is something you wouldn't be surprised to find in Old Town.  The quality of this food is great. While I was waiting for my meal, the sushi chef handed me little creations to sample while I waited. Awesome service even for someone doing takeout! We did the Bang Bang Shrimp, Pad Thai, Crunchy Shrimp Roll, and a Vegas Roll. All were dynamite. Happy to have Angelina's out on the West Side!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. I had the pad thai chicken and it was definately one of my favorites I've had. Came here for a birthday party and hope to be back again even tho I live in Gilbert. Everything was fresh and tasted amazing. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here.  I am a little addicted to Prawn in Clay Pot.  The food has great taste and the service is always good."}
{"text":"Came in tonight with the family, I asked for something off menu and they agreed to make for me.  California rolls in a bowl topped with par-baked salmon and  Delicious sauce on top.  They brought out something different but was just as delicious .   We also had calamari as appetizer , bang bang shrimp, spring rolls and salmon rolls, Angelina's spicy lover pho, and Angelina's special pho. Everything is perfect"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new Pho place, was pretty disappointed. Started off with them being out of every kind of juice for the kids except for cranberry. Then they only had enough Thai tea left for one drink. We ordered drinks and a appetizer of egg rolls. Waiter brought back the drinks for the kids and two waters for the adults minus the Thai tea and egg rolls. We went ahead and ordered our meals. The sea food Pho had a funky taste not something you want to take a chance on. No soy sauce at the table we had to ask for it food came before the appetizer when asked about the appetizer it had been in the window the whole time. Still no Thai tea. The egg rolls said 4 per serving in actuality it was 2 cut in half! Will never eat here again, complained to waiter was compensated with no charge for egg rolls. Still no Thai tea! Thank god there is a Pho place less then a couple miles away that is excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho and very fresh ingredients! We found this place by accident because we were going to the Asian Market next door. We knew it existed by Yelp, but didn't map it. Glad we did! Service was exceptional! We had two different primary servers/bartenders, Jackson and Hannah. Super knowledgeable of the menus! I'm gluten-free and Hannah new exactly what I could have.   Nice size restaurant. Simple decor. Clean restrooms. Right in line with the market on pricing. We had the chicken & shrimp Pho and the brisket & rare Pho. Both were very tasty and lots of leftovers because we ordered the larger sizes. We will definitely return! Also had the house spring rolls which were yummy!  They serve Hiro Sake which is nice too. They offer a full bar if sake isn't your thing."}
{"text":"Great Sushi and amazing Pho. Friendly and helpful staff too. Its not your average sushi bar either. They have items that you wont find at other sushi joints.   Fantastic food and they are striving to offer options that aren't as americanized as other places. It is a must try."}
{"text":"Had to take away 1star because service was subpar. Took forever to get soda refill, server never came back to check after food was brought out. Food delivery was slow. All the servers were behind counter socializing instead of watching for customers in need...very frustrating. The food was GOOD had perfectly prepared calamari, and seafood pho."}
{"text":"Good pho, basic as you would find at most places. Broth was good. My only \"complaint\" was the fish sauce was not on the table, but if you ask, they will bring some to you. If you are in the area I would go again."}
{"text":"The food here is great but the service is so, so slow. They are way understaffed. We waited over an hour for our food and saw people who had waited for even longer. This would definitely be an excellent restaurant if they could fix the service problem. Unfortunately I don't have the time to eat here again."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service. Very clean and fresh The best Pho in town. Good place to grab lunch or dinner if you are on the run. Still the quality of food is good."}
{"text":"We loved the fresh vegetables for the soup.  Far from where we live.  Will be back.  Somewhat slow service on the afternoon we visited - dined on patio."}
{"text":"WORST VEGAN PHO IVE EVER HAD.  However, my boyfriend LOVED his shrimp pho, he said it was top 5 list of best pho he has ever had, and we eat a lot of pho. The service is fast and nice and the place is clean. So, if you don't want vegan pho definitely go here!   My vegan pho was SO BLAND it tasted like they just rinsed off the veggies and used that water as broth.. plus the veggies tasted dirty like they weren't washed. I added sooooo much salt, 4 slices of jalapeño, and 4 lemon slices of juice and it still wasn't edible.  Also, they don't have limes.? That was odd to me."}
{"text":"Pho is always great. This service is awesome. Springs rolls are super yummy. I love this place."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!! Sitting here for 15 minutes and no one has even asked for drinks (not even water). This was a second attempt trying to redeem from the first experience where the waiters didn't know what was on the menu and several of the things we tried to order FROM THE MENU were not available. Bad service and the food is not even that good.  **UPDATE** Finally had to LEAVE because no one would acknowledge us after 20 minutes of being there (still no drinks); even tried waving a few waiters down. Asked for the manager and were getting the name \"Jackson\" who was unhelpful in any way. Don't waste your time or hard earned money.   Got a lovely response from someone at this business trying to say that we came in 4 minutes before close. No... we were sitting there for so long that we finally left about 10 minutes until close. We looked up the hours of all the food places in the area to make sure that we were not going somewhere that was about to close. I stand by my review despite the interesting attempt to \"justify\" the service we received. All we wanted was a sincere apology; not excuses. I understand that our experiences may not be representative of everyone's and that is what this review service is for. We had more than one bad experience so I believe my rating and review are warranted. People can take them all into consideration. With that being said, the managers can take comfort in knowing that we will never return here."}
{"text":"Everything that comes out of the kitchen is super tasty and the staff are great people! We dine here every week. My 3 year old even loves the Pho!"}
{"text":"Look, this review is gonna be jacked up, but short.  As my Dad lies dying (literally) I knew Mom hadn't eaten in anything real in a couple of days. I stopped in to grab some Banh Mi sandwiches to take to those at their house. Nope. They don't make those. So, I opted to splurge on Mom and grab her some medium-rare lamb chops to go. Done and done. I enjoyed part of a Sapporo on draft while I waited. I figured she would toss the noodles and whatever else accompanied the chops out. Wrong. She ate all the noodles/sauce/veggies, devoured the chops, and saved the rice for later. $30 WELL SPENT IN THIS CASE. I think my Sis is gonna run up there in a few to get some Pho for herself and take a break from bedsitting Dad. She should. Thanks, Elaine."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very nice and very modern. The only thing that was an issue is that the table was not very sturdy, that's pretty much it. The Angelina's fried rice was amazing as well as the spicy seafood bowl but it wasn't spicy at all. I will come back to the restaurant to try other dishes that they have to offer in the future"}
{"text":"The cha ca la vong served here is a disgrace. It's nowhere near what the actual dish should be like. The seasoning was bland and I can not taste the turmeric at all. In fact I couldnt taste anything at all! It did not come with a vegetable plate and rice paper to roll it with and no sauce on the side. It was a $14 rip off that lacked flavor and was a completely americanized dish. Worse cha ca la vong ever."}
{"text":"Always fresh and amazing. Ordered the Pad Thai and it was a huge portion of deliciousness. They also have outstanding customer service, the guys are inviting and friendly. A new favorite."}
{"text":"Best pho ever! My favorite pho joint and best we have found in AZ by far. We go weekly on pho-riday. They know us there and we take family and friends any chance we can get. All of their other entrees are great too. I haven't taken anyone who said they wouldn't be back. If you haven't been here...GO...RIGHT NOW!"}
{"text":"Came here to eat with my friends 2 weeks ago. I ordered pho for around $8-9. Apparently it's gluten-free but didn't notice, tell, nor care. Prices were a little up there for their dishes. Nice location. Would rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. One of the best pho places I've been to. I recommend the #6 if you like it spicy . Don't forget to order the appetizer spring rolls with peanut sauce... Those are pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Good pricing. There spring rolls with the strawberries inside are amazing. When we first walked in it wasn't busy at all but before we left the places was packed with people. The Pho was also pretty good. All around good."}
{"text":"Angelina's always delivers! Never waited more than 3 mins to be seated. All day happy hour on Sunday is my favorite. Sake bombs are my personal favorite. Menu is decently priced and service is great! I have come multiple times and will continue to return!"}
{"text":"I first visited Angelina's Pho & Grill, when it first opened last year, when a friend of mine from our school brought me there. I was happy to see a Pho place so close to school. The food is decent. The price was decent at the time. I have visited the place every month or so and observed that the prices started to rise. However, the quality of the food and customer service stay the same: the foods are just 'decent' and it may take a while to get the waiter/waitress's attention.  Originally from California, I think Pho from Angelina's is no where near the 'authentic' taste. A new pho place \"Pho Viet\" about 2 blocks down is more authentic and is slightly less expensive, and customer service is much better. The owner of 'Pho Viet' personally come out and greet everyone each time I came there with classmates."}
{"text":"The portions are great. Ace service very friendly and enthusiastic. Broth was somewhat lacking flavor. Had the pho with steak and it contained a generous amount of meat. That's great."}
{"text":"One of the best first time experiences I have ever had.   Great service, great food:  Grilled chicken here is awesome!  #6 and #8 Pho were bomb.  Bang Bang shrimp killer."}
{"text":"I have no words on how good this place is, from service to the chef and his creations that are out this world delicious. I have been to many sushi restaurants in LA, Europe and wow in my 25 years of life in have never enjoyed such good service and food. The amazing part about it was sitting at the sushi bar and watching the chef make all the beautiful creations, see the passion, love and attention to detail. WOWWOWWOOWOWO I will come here now every week and definitely will recommend to anyone that loves sushi and true Japanese and Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"This place was decent when it first opened, but it has progressively become worse, which is not what you want to see in a restaurant. Their broth is never consistent--it can be super bland one day, and salty the next. Also, their prices are \"higher\" than you'd expect for Pho, considering the portion sizes are not large. Same goes for their happy hour deals. There are a lot better Vietnamese restaurants close to here (Pho Viet at 43rd and Bell). The worst part of this place is the service. It is slow and the staff/owners have no manners. If I could, I would give Angelina's 0 stars.  I will not be coming back here or recommending this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Awful service. Brought me my check before I received any food."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was amazing but service was beyond horrible! We got there and were seated immediately and it took them an hour to get out food out. What made it worse was that other people who were seated after us were already served and leaving by the time we got our food. When we asked our server what happened he immediately got defensive and said the kitchen was backed up."}
{"text":"Delicious meal, Great vegetarian options. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Wow just called this place to Order food and someone's answers the phone and says hello? Um sorry is this a restaurant no this is my cell phone so I try explaining how yelp has this number on there and they say oh let me give the phone to the waiter by the way I'm still so confused on who I was taking to, so she gets on the phone and don't say anything is taking an order with some one else I can hear her talking and then she answers the phone and says hello? And I'm like can I order food and her attitude was like huh? Like what is wrong with this place so rude and unprofessional and don't have no costumer service what so ever!!! I try over and over to give this place a chance and it always fails!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband just had sushi the other night @ Angelina's and it was spectacular! ! Tom; the owner, head chef and sushi chef has out done himself!  Amazing quality fish! Wonderful nigiri and rolls!  We are so happy they are doing sushi now. (Only btw Thursday through Sunday for sushi)  their regular menu and pho is still amazing and delicious!  Best pho we have had in the valley.  Go and check'm out!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Been here on several visits and have noticed improvements each time.   Pros:  - Modern upscale decor, clean restaurant inside despite how it looks outside - Awesome bar area -Food is good, nothing spectacular. Not very authentic Viet food (definitely more Americanized) but that doesn't bother me too much. -Big servings -Happy hour specials with 40% off appetizers -Friendly staff...but...  Cons:  -Inefficient staff (seemed very inexperienced in the business, kept forgetting our orders and never wrote them down, kept forgetting to bring our drink orders, and when they did they forgot to refill drinks)  -Food is good, nothing spectacular -wish there were more items on the menu  FOOD ITEMS:  -Beef BBQ spring rolls- they take a different twist on it and add avocado, lettuce and hoison sauce marinated beef but its probably my favorite thing on the menu  - Lettuce wraps- chicken, baby shrimp and glass noodles (you know the korean kind) and peanuts for the mix and slices of lettuce served with a the sweet-fish sauce-chili concoction. I had a hard time wrapping this in the lettuce so I ate it on its own and took a bite of lettuce lol. Seriously, it was just like stir fried noodles.  -Pho- Mehhh. I used to live a few miles from Little Saigon so I've tasted good Pho. I would call this broth very bland. However the noodles are cooked al dente and the beef is standard so I would come back here again for it if I was craving pho and didnt want to drive too far. 2.5 out of 5 at most.  - Crispy noodle- this is a popular egg noodle dish that I don't see at a lot of Viet restaurants here but its pretty good. You get a huge portion. It has a meat or shrimp option, vegetables and the sauce reminds me of chop-suey but the noodles are the crispy kind. I would order this again.  -Shrimp and sweet potato tempura. Pretty standard, good if you're a sweet potato lover like me  -Grilled Chicken entree- yummy and comes with a side of their pho broth. Healthy, tasty, big portion  Will continue to come back and try other items and because I like the decor and overall vibe. In the meantime, hopefully the staff will improve, they add more items to the menu and the quality of the pho gets better."}
{"text":"So good!! I orders the Pad Thai! We also ordered the spring rolls!! Best Spring Rolls I've ever had! Great service! Fresh ingredients and great taste! Kid friendly and handicap ok! Make sure to ask for extra peanut sauce! That shizzz taste good on everything! Jackson was our server and he is so nice!! Ask for him if want fast speedy service."}
{"text":"Very good!  I had the tofu curry.  Most places deep fry it until it becomes spongy.... Not here!"}
{"text":"Must say for my first pho experience, i loved it . Got the #7 to go and was amazed by the amount of food provided. The broth- perfect ! The dish did not lack any flavor for me.  A 5 minute wait is well worth the food from this gem, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"BEST PHO IN NW Phoenix! I've tried the Pho place off cave creek & the 101 and another Pho place in the same area & I must admit that they serve the BEST here at Angelina's."}
{"text":"This is our first time here.  Great food, excellent service, very nice place. Recommend Angelinas to everyone."}
{"text":"I eat Pho very often and I have been to many different places, but Angelina's is by far hands down my favorite! I always get the #1 and I love the meats and flavor. I highly recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"First, I was asked if I still wanted my iced coffee because it would take 10 minutes to make. You figure that question would mean the food would be out very quickly.  Wrong...20 minutes after giving our order the waiter gave an excuse that the printer was not working on the order machine and that he just wrote the order down for the cook.  When asked how long, the waiter replied from far away the table that it would be 10-15 minutes and he would give us a discount on our food.  There were no place settings on the table.  We sat and watch another family get up after waiting a long time to order or even be acknowledged.  As the family was leaving the waiter just stared and didn;t even attempt to stop them and the female waitress just commented they are leaving.  My son went to the bathroom to wash his hand and he said that the urinal was stuffed with toilet paper and there was urine on the floor.  My daughter went to the the bathroom and the water was barely coming out of the faucet when turned to full blast.  We finally got our food and the pho which I had ordered with tendon had one small fragment of tendon.  The waiter did bring out another bowl of tendon.  Another disturbing fact was that a waitress attempted to sit a family at a table which was clearly not clean.  The customer commented that there was something under the table and the waitress just pulled out the chair and proceeded to kick the food away from the table with her foot.   Also, they allowed solicitors to come in and try to sell large pixie sticks to the customers.  The iced coffee was very watered down.  We finally finished our meal and it took a while to get the check and then for the waiter to come back and take payment.  We had to walk up to the front to pay.  It seemed that none of the waiters or waitresses knew which tables they had.  I don't think they were assigned because they were all asking each other if the other had the table.   Also, the chef was behind the counter serving up food all the while talking on his cell phone.  Is that sanitary or even appropriate?  All in all it was not a pleasant experience which took 2 hours just to have some pho.  Unacceptable...and when suggested that to the water his comment was what would you like me to do about it I already gave you a discount.   I read in YELP after the fact that they had many comments about their poor service.  Wouldn't you take those comments and try to make it better?  The food was good but I will not be returning...sorry to say."}
{"text":"Nice decor. I had seared tuna salad. It was quite nice. We tried the veg pho - wasn't all that great.  The worst part was the service - our server was Jackson. He never cracked a smile. Didn't come back to the table unless we called him - we had to call him 3 times. Even to refill waters. He single handedly made it a real poor dining experience for us.  Not coming back again."}
{"text":"My friends are regulars here. They brought me here like 3 weeks ago because they loved the place so much and we were craving sushi. The staff was so friendly and the food was great! It's right across the street from my work, so me and my co worker decide we wanted to grab a bite to eat and some drinks after work so we come by.. Customer service is absolutely phenomenal! The owner Tom even remembered my name from my one previous visit. The food is wonderful, the restaurant is clean, the staff is one of a kind. Even the bathrooms are kept clean. I'd recommend this place to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Angelina's Pho has very good pho broth. The combo pho came with good amount of meat along with noodles. You can choose from a large or small size. For me, small was perfect while large was sufficient for my teenager. I usually don't drink too much of the broth unless it's really good but here I managed to drink good portion of it. It didn't have the artificial taste that lot of other pho places have. And I wasn't thirsty afterwards meaning it had minimal to no msg.   The spicy seafood clay pot had nice curry flavor and came with tons of seafood. It was worth the $20 price tag. However, the 'clay pot' in its name is misleading. It was served in a large flat bowl. Maybe it was cooked in a clay pot... in either case, I'd like to eat here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place and can't say enough about the friendly and helpful staff.  They remember who you are when you walk in again.  The food is outstanding. The pho flavors are to die for.  We even love the spring rolls and they taste fresh.  Still our favorite place to have Pho in town."}
{"text":"Customer service is a big issue here. Once you walk in you wait for a long time. One customer was getting irritated with them because he kept waiting and not getting his to go order. Some of the customers were just ignored and walked out because they couldn't wait anymore. Quality of their food is decent but the customer service needs to be fixed. When you see multiple people leaving their tables it will hurt your business. I think the biggest problem at this place is leadership and lack of leadership skills. Also waitress should never tell other customers \"oh that guy is mad at me\", because he waited long time for his order. I just don't think it's professional."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their banh canh cua! The broth is thicker than most places but that's what I was looking for... Will most likely be back again! Everyone is also very friendly.  Love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Angelina's seems to have gone through a change of management. What used to be our go-to spot every Tuesday...has become, less frequent because of changes. One - lime is a crucial ingredient in Vietnamese cuisine, yet, they choose to use lemons because of costs. They have introduced an iPad POS that makes servers work harder! Not more efficiently. We love our wait staff, but see flaws in process."}
{"text":"Again this place wasn't busy but 2 times in a row we were seated and brought water but then no one came by to ask if we needed anything the place definitely was not busy it was just ridiculous you would think they would want returning customers but apparently not.   My daughter was really looking to some pho but if anything like the service we won't return"}
{"text":"I had the #1 pho. It was good. I didn't care for the cinnamon flavor in the broth. The price was $9 for regular. The large is just $1 more, but you only get more broth, not more stuff. Yelp had a free soda on check in, so use that if available. I had the iced tea. Co-worker got the seafood hot pot and he ate every last bit. It was full of seafood, but pricey at $19.   This isn't my favorite pho place. I like Pho Avina nearby which is really good. They give a lot more side toppings than this place.  This place has the look of an attempt at trendy, but falls short. It has a bar inside. Played 80s music. One curtain pole was about to fall down. Tile on floor was in disrepair in spots.   The service was great, we had a guy. The girl waitress seemed nice. She got us some extra items.   I give it a 3.5/5.   There's a pho place on camelback, just east of the I-17 that is always packed and has super super low prices, and fast service and the best pho.  Also a place on mayo blvd near Scottsdale rd and loop 101, Tea Lite Cafe that is also great and ranks higher than this place for me."}
{"text":"My first time trying Pho and it was very flavorful. Great service and yummy food. Will have to try it again soon"}
{"text":"I was enthusiastic about trying a new pho place close to home. The service and food was bad from start to finish. I definitely do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Omg the best pho soup I've ever had,  salmon spring rolls are delicous,  calamari with aioli sauce explodes flavor in your mouth,  the curry is on point,  this is our favorite spot.  Great relaxed atmosphere,  good vibes Abs amazing food.  Thanks Tom"}
{"text":"This food is amazing!  Healthy, light and very tasty.  We've always received great service and the prices are fair.  This is worth the extra drive."}
