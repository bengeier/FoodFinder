{"text":"A hidden gem in that neighborhood, have been there twice for breakfast and it was excellent, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Once a week my girlfriend and I stop in for breakfast before shopping in the West Side Market and we've never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"I'm rating this a 2 based on going here three times. The first two times were good. Fast and good service, good food, and reasonably priced. Today, we went for brunch and sadlly, it was awful. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was terrible. Boiled tiny shrimp smothered in a thick gravy over yellow grits with bacon bits. My husband's burger was overdone and the pretzel bun was over toasted. They do for my drink for about 10 minutes and served it too warm. I do not plan to go back even though the first two times were good."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding! It's a very casual place, but the food that comes out of this kitchen is carefully crafted! The chicken quesadilla really was the best one I've had yet! I have been to many Mexican restaurants and lunch spots none of them top this one..Prime Rib is pretty amazing too!! It's only available on Saturdays, with housemade gravy and potatoes..FYI.. breakfast sandwiches with potatoes are really good here. The breakfast sandwiches can come with these small quartered breakfast hash brown potatoes.. This place is a like little known secret."}
{"text":"I love it here, farm to your table, friendly and helpful salespeople.  Everyone seems so laid back and relaxed.  Whatever you want or need is there.  One of the few places that the only color they see is green, not black or white or brown. Come enjoy the market.  My favorite day is Saturday when everyone is open, Sunday not so much.  Love it here"}
{"text":"After a long night being rowdy Jays fans and trying to torment the Cleveland Indians, you need a morning plate of grease and grub.

This was a Sunday and everything is literally closed in this ghost town, except for the West Side Market Cafe. A typical breakfast/brunch diner. 

I ordered the Huevos Racheros which was delicious. Portion was on the small side but it was enough to get me by. Everyone else order their Market Breakfast was had their special spicy bacon, eggs and hash. It was delicious and portion size was big.

Pricing is fair... minus the currency. 

Service is super friendly. They can take quite a while to take your order but that is only because they are always full. I respect them for that.

I'm curious about their dinner. That will have to wait until next year.

Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This New York style cafe is just that-- bustling with local foods, brews, and people. With a minty green atmosphere and nostalgic photographs hanging on the wall, including some history about the market. It's small but people are friendly and service is fairly quick in regards of how busy they usually are! Went for Mother's Day brunch and was totally satisfied with portions and how colorful (food wise) the plates were. Also had a Hawaiian mimosa with the biggest strawberry I'd ever seen. Such a cool place to grab a bite, also did I mention their waffles are to die for? Snuck a bite from a friend and they are."}
{"text":"we were here over a holiday weekend and though it was busy, we were seated quite promptly. the wait staff here are cheerful - they kept chitchatting with customers, especially those who have to wait a bit longer to be seated.

our food arrived hot and was delicious. cheese was not rubbery on the burger, fries were crispy, and the vegetables tasted fresh.

great value and great company!"}
{"text":"Omg this is the best way to start a day at The West Side Market!! I am absolutely in love with their breakfast potatoes and if I lived close enough I'd be broke and fat because I'd eat them every chance I had! 
My husband and I have been here twice now and we love it. They have a really nice menu for breakfast and it's not just eggs and toast! My favorite is the eggs and potatoes with sausage gravy on it. I leave nothing behind on the plate - it is absolutely a guilty pleasure for me because it tastes so much like a home cooked southern breakfast. I want to come back and have the shrimp and grits but that gravy just gets me every time...
My husband loves their gravy too. He likes the fact he is a meat and potatoes kind of guy and they don't skimp on the breakfast meats.

Our biggest hurdle is we eat breakfast and then have no room left for snacks in the market!!!  oh well that's what take homes are for!"}
{"text":"my wife & i took a weekend road-trip on (Sat.14.Oct - Mon.16.Oct.2016) we ended up in ClevelandOH, so we always heard if ever in Cleveland go to Westside Market & Cafe, so we did, wow was we blown away of the magnitude & size of this market and all the fresh food it was straight out awesome, so we had lunch & breakfast at the Westside Market Cafe twice (Sat.15.Oct. & Mon.16.Oct.), both times the food was very delicious and the service was terrific, defiantly a place not to pass up. i give it a 5 star."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming down here for breakfast. Our friends and I always get together here for an early start to our market trip, and it's full of fresh, tasty, and filling options. It does tend to get busy on prime days, but I never had to wait too long to get sat. 

I get the market breakfast, which includes two eggs, a heaping pile of potatoes, and two slices of toast for $5. You simply cannot beat that, especially when everyone's waiting in line for $10-$15 breakfasts at trendier restaurants in the same area.

Love the atmosphere; as it feels like your eating in someone's kitchen. Service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Meh....Wandered here one afternoon after not wanting to deal with the busy downtown crowd.

It was about 1pm, they closed at 2 so i honestly wasnt sure they would serve me.There was maybe 4 people in the restaurant.

So i sat at the bar, some daytime television literally BLARING over some heavy rap music from the kitchen wasnt the ambience i wanted for lunch, but hey i was already here and parked.

Menu was one page, limited. Good breakfast menu ( its served until 2) and a limited lunch/dinner menu.

I got a chicken sandwich on pretzel bun with some fries.....literally it was some fries. They were shoestring fries, not very filling. The chicken looked amazing, crispy, fried golden to perfection, unfortunately it had not one ounce of seasoning. I had to smother it in some hot sauce to get my taste buds going. It came with honey mustard but i didnt even get to taste that as i got maybe a pinch of it on my bun. The chicken was huge, way too big for my bun which left me with a chicken breast and no bun once i got through the majority of it. It led to a messy lunch which was i was not pleased with.

The staff was eh. My waitress was nice, kept asking if i needed anything, but the line cooks. HA. i got hit on left and right, not exactly what I want while im eating. Not to mention clearly stating im married didnt seem to bother them. 

Aside from feeling like a piece of meat my experience was blase. Id probably go back just to avoid the downtown rush since it was empty in there, the price was good, but the owners or managers need to fix things up a bit."}
{"text":"Visited West Side Market Cafe for brunch on a Sunday.  Started with Bloody Mary's.  We had the WSMC Bloody and Regular version - both were good. Our food choices were the Chicken and Waffles and Hungarian Hash.  Both were very enjoyable.  Our waitress Mary was awesome, just the right amount of attention and very friendly. The restaurant address is listed on W 25th street, so not being familiar with the area, we had a little issue finding it.  You actually enter through the West Side Market on 25th street and the cafe entrance is located at the right back corner of the Market. We will definitely be back the next time we visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this Cafe.  After touring the market itself, you simply HAVE TO FIND a way to consume some of the lovely food on the display and this did the trick, as they source quite a bit of stuff from the \"market next door\".  We tried pierogis which was a first for us.  The waitress chatted us up and gave us great recommendations from the menu.  All in all a great place to relax with a beer and try some great food after overdosing on the stalls in the food market."}
{"text":"We were in the market and I was checking out all of the cool meat counters and other Eastern European goodies, so that is exactly what I was craving for lunch. Sure they were some hipster-ish looking restaurants down the road but I wanted something classic. So that's just what I got. I started with a spicy body bloody Mary, then my husband and I split the pierogie platter (it contained 3 potato pierogies and a side of sour cream and applesauce) and the Reuben. The corned beef on the sandwich was amazing! The hubs got a local IPA and all of this for 18 bucks plus tip. Hit the spot for some classic diner food for sure!"}
{"text":"The only sit down restaurant in the entire Westside market is small and cozy. The food is good but not great. Because it is the only sit down restaurant there are not many choices if you are hungry and want to have lunch. Breakfast is the way to go here in the server until 11 AM. Lunch is Average, with such fare as burgers, and various sandwiches. Most of the sandwiches average about 10 bucks each with no sides. Add on fries for two dollars or their signature bacon brussels sprouts for three dollars. Service is good. Bathrooms are upstairs but relatively clean. Because it was about 5Â° out we opted to eat in today, but in the future I would probably opt for something else on the west side outside of the market."}
{"text":"Strolling around West Side Market can leave a girl rather ravenous and ready to inhale some delicious food. 

I am so glad this magical cafe is a 45 minute drive, because their breakfast potatoes will leave you with an addiction for them and make you contemplate if dieting is even worth it. 

Service is always spot on, your food is always hot, and delicious. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This is where you go on a cold, depressing morning in Cleveland... Or any other day of the year but this hit the spot after coming off a red eye flight. Parking is right next door and we were greeted and told to sit wherever immediately. Our server was amazing! 

I love a good bloody mary and they have a cheese/sausage/pickle skewer in their specialty one. Yasss. It's the cutest little cafe with a perfect menu (breakfast/lunch/dinner) and right next to the west side market if you need to pick up some fresh food. I wish I would have known about this place when I lived here and I will be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Great local spot.  if you're visiting the West Side Market - or Cleveland in general - for the first time, it's worth going to the Cafe for breakfast.  

The atmosphere and history are really what makes the Cafe great, there's nothing gourmet about the food.  It's basically an old school diner in terms of what's served (high quality food though, so don't let the diner comparison turn you off).

If you like Kielbasa, go for the Hungarian Hash."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back! Food was delicious and service was pretty good too. Bloody Mary is good, but spicy! So if you don't like spice or don't like your Bloody Mary spicy use caution. I had the WSMC Bloody Mary so I'm not sure if the regular one is as spicy but I would assume so. The corned beef hash was SO GOOD! I've had corned beef hash in the past and I was never truly impressed. My eggs were cooked perfect to order too! The Bloody Mary got even better with my food, complimented it very nicely! 

I tried a bite of my friends French toast and it was pretty tasty. I also tried a bite of my friends sausage gravy and I didn't like it at all. The gravy was on the sweet side to me. There's not a lot of sausage gravy that compares to my Granny's who grew up in WV, though. 

Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I came in for a quick breakfast before exploring the market and sat at the bar. I ordered a coffee and the hungarian hash that had kielbasa, potatoes, and eggs. The potato to kielbasa ratio was off - there were a ton of potatoes, but this was really delicious and filling. The coffee was also very good. The waitresses float and take care of everyone but I had good service and did not wait long for my food. This is a great option for a quick, filling breakfast at a good price."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times and usually it's pretty good. This time however, was not one of those times. Stopped by for lunch, was seated quickly. Holy hell was it loud. The place is never really quiet but this was just horribly loud.

Fountain drink was over carbonated. Ordered the Mile High Turkey Club and received it sans bacon, which is a cardinal sin. Nearly as bad were the burnt potato chips that accompanied the sandwich. Even the pickles tasted \"off\". 

Service was ok. Place is never clean, but that's kind of expected."}
{"text":"A little noisy as the place is packed. However quick efficient service. Food was so good; you can tell they use quality ingredients. Fairly priced. Would definitely come again for breakfast!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for breakfast early on a Saturday morning before hitting the market. We've never eaten here before, but have heard good things.
She had the Belgian waffle- she said it was OK. I had the Market Special and got a side of meat for $3.00- I chose sausage links. The special is 2 eggs any style (I got scrambled- they were actually done well, not dry and they actually salted them) White toast (Toast is toast) , home fries (these were hunks of potatoes- they looked better than they were) and the sausage, ahh the sausage. $3.00 gets you 3 links, and it's not the best sausage. The coffee was awful. It was $24.00 (with tip) for the 2 of us.So if we go back, maybe it'll be for lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best hash browns on the planet. Great lunch menu with not-quite-artisanal but definitely plussed-up sandwiches and burgers. But for sure make it before 11a to capture the full breakfast menu, if that's your thing - and it's definitely advised. Since its attached to a really cool indoor farmer's market, all the food sourcing is fresh and top notch, it's well worth a stroll through on your way in or out of the cafe."}
{"text":"We were delightfully surprised while stopping in here for a bite after shopping in the market. At first, it was packed and waaay too loud, but our server, Caitlyn, was wonderfully prompt and personable. We decided to share 3 dishes amongst the 3 of us. We purchased the quesadilla (great salsa, btw!), the Reuben (so flavorful), and my ultimate favorite, the BBQ pulled pork sliders on pretzel buns! We walked out of there very satisfied and very full. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast always!  Get the old style has Brown's, now dinner on Fri and Sat. Liquor and beer and wine!!"}
{"text":"Just got in to Cleveland last night, got a tip this morning from a friend to try the West Side Market Cafe for breakfast, he said I would not be disappointed.... and I wasn't. 
To start the portion size was large, the eggs cooked perfectly, I got the hash browns which were excellent, and I ordered some blueberry pancakes which were the star of the meal light and fluffy with real blueberries. 
All in all I enjoyed breakfast and will make a trip back for lunch or dinner before I leave town."}
{"text":"The place is really nice. Quite the local ambient and flavor. Ingredients are sourced from the market. The service is really friendly and they make sure you are well taken care of. Prices are pretty reasonable. I had the eggs benedict with hash browns and while the eggs were not spectacular the hash browns were fantastic! Hands down the best ones I have ever had! Another down side is that they don't take AMEX and since I was traveling on business I couldn't bill tto my corporate card, but this should not affect regular casual customers. Parking can be a challenge too but I went early on a Sunday morning and was able to get street parking."}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot. Had the pierogi sandwich on rosemary bread with a TON of munster cheese. Awesome!

The fries were OK, a little oily flavored.

Nice little beer selection to boot. Get a buzz on before you go shopping in the market."}
{"text":"So. We were so excited to try this place and we were very disappointed 

First of all, we didn't get our coffee refilled until we asked. I HATE this!! It's a peeve of mine. 

Second, my husband, who LOVES chicken and waffles, ordered it and couldn't eat it. Had a weird, greasy taste. 

We won't be back. 

Bummed"}
{"text":"A great place for a taste of Cleveland history! The food is nothing short of amazing, the coffee is fresh, and the service is great! Grab breakfast or lunch here and then take a look around the West Side Market."}
{"text":"i have just had the worst breakfast at this place. the servers did not feel like interrupting their conversation so after an awkward moment of me standing and them looking at me one of them said Sit anywhere! A few minutes later, presumably when they were thru talking, i was given a menu.
Later i was warned the bowl is hot, really hot, which was true bust sadly the grits inside the cup were not only not hot they were overcooked and tasteless. 
my poached eggs were mush and the \" hash browns\" aka sliced potatoes dropped in hot oil and barely drained were inedible.
the only up side of this morning's fare is there no danger of overeating..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Great ambiance, lots of people.  Staff is very polite and friendly.  My 11yr old son had the Brunch Burger and loved it.  He says food is very tasty and filling.  I had steak and eggs which were great.  Very reasonable.  Glad we came here.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had high hopes but if I'm to be honest, this experience just wasn't up to par with what I feel is expected when dining out. There were three of us on a Saturday at about 9:30. The way they squeezed us into tables was a bit absurd. I could barely pull my chair out without hitting the person behind me and we may as well have pushed our table up against the table beside us because we were that close.  It was very tight quarters and I'm not a huge guy. 

I tried to order the Corned Beef Hash & Eggs but our waitress came back and said they were out of corned beef. So I then ordered the Creamed Chipped Beef but was told they did not have that available either.  So by 9:30a they were out of two breakfast dishes. I ended up just ordering the Brunch Wrap and was very disappointed with it. It was just a fried egg with bacon and some cheese inside a tortilla shell served with potatoes. The potatoes were decent but the wrap was a joke. It was tiny and had no flavor at all. I could have made this at home easily and saved $8.  When our food was brought out it was brought at different times so one of us had food before the others. Two coffees were brought when only one was ordered and then we were told by he waitress that we ordered two. Well, two out of the three of us are not coffee drinkers so I'm fairly certain we would not have ordered that extra coffee.  I believe we were charged for it but it took so long to get our check in the first place that I didn't care. I just wanted to get out of that cramped area and go about my day.  

It was not a great experience at all but I would be willing to try it again.  I would certainly order something different.  Perhaps it was just an off day.  It is hard to say though with so many other breakfast destinations in the area."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off a couple times a year for the past 8 years, which is basically forever. My dad and I used to stop in for breakfast before shopping in at the market. From that I can say their prices have definitely increased (it was insanely cheap back then) but their menu has definitely evolved as well. 

My most recent stop I got the huevos rancheros and it was fantastic. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were super prompt on taking my order and refilling my coffee and water - which at the level of my hangover was extremely impressive. She even offered me a coffee to go! 

I've been surprised at the low ratings for this place as I've never had a subpar experience here and always take my guests here before taking them through the market and they've always loved it. Most recently, I went on a Sunday and it was cool to wander through the market as the vendors mosey in and open up shop getting used to the new Sunday schedule."}
{"text":"Cleveland steak sandwich was a open face sandwich with  1/4 inch steak and cheese with grilled pepper.

No where close to flavors found in Philly cheesesteak but also really really bland.  Steak was hard to chew on too.  The chips however was fresh and made fresh.  Crab cakes deep fried was tasty but not wowza.  This is an old establishment been around ww2 and the food and nostalgia reflects that too."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites. Service is always great. Even when crowded. 

The menu is full of great options. 

And it's always great to be able to walk into the WSM after."}
{"text":"Great food, service was a little slow. The Bloody Mary was very good but spicy. I think it was a mix though. I would recommend the corn beef hash made with yellow potatoes. Parking is difficult."}
{"text":"Must stop and visit when you're in Cleveland. Tons of vendors to see and cafes to stop and grab a bite to eat. Gyros, crepes, hot dogs, sausages, chocolate covered bacon, pastry's, lattes and fresh fruit to try! There is also a brewery with tons of seating and great beers."}
{"text":"Erin is a friendly, professional server that makes excellent suggestions.  The wild mushroom and grilled cheese on rosemary is our of sight!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for brunch. Go there. Enjoy it. Hit up the market when you're done."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! I got the zucchini fritters and chicken quesadilla and both were delicious. My husband got the shrimp and grits which he said 2as amazing. Portions were much bigger than what I expected for the price. A great value! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was friendly and very fast. Our meals were hot and tasty. We had the Hungarian hash. I would've liked to seen the potatoes diced smaller and a bit more meat, but it was really good."}
{"text":"I LOVE the west side market cafe! Granted I've only been here twice and had the same thing both times, it was consistently amazing! I highly recommend coming here to cure a hangover, the fried egg sandwich is heavenly. The bread is super soft, the bacon is thick cut with maple and the cheese oozes on all sides. The potatoes are an addition, but so worth it! They are crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside seasoned to perfection. I finished my sandwich and immediately wished I could start over and eat it again, it was so yummy!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast restaurants, for dine in or takeout. The food is always super fresh and perfectly cooked. The prices are great and you get so much food for your money!"}
{"text":"Perfect ppt and set up for brunch. I saw one person criticize the menu as being only one page - and it was - but it was extensive and had some unique items or twists on the brunch standards. 
The place was filled but we were lucky enough to be there on a holiday Sunday and we're able to get. Seat with a minimal wait.  
Service was friendly. Our own waitress was outstanding and you could see the rest of the staff was similarly engages. 
Plus the restaurant has the added benefit of being next to one of the top tourist attractions in Cleveland - the West Side Market - and steps from Great Lakes  Brewing, the  Tremont Street and Ohio City neighborhoods. 
I had the wild mushroom grilled cheese on Rosemary bread and couldn't have asked for anything better. My wife had the vegetable frittata and loved it."}
{"text":"Stopped in from out of town with my family, drawbacks are small atmosphere with not much waiting area at all. Positives were the service was good (once we got a table), the variety of dishes was great for everyone, and the quality of food was excellent. Not your average breakfast place, but they have something for everyone. Would definitely stop by here again, might make sure I eat a small snack before because of the wait time.. but overall very good."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in a landmark location.  I've only eaten breakfast here but had it many times.  Staff are always great as is the food.  Perfect spot for food after a night shift - the staff are understanding of the scattered arrivals times for the after work crowd and will let you grab a table for an indeterminate number of people who aren't yet present and don't complain.  That is unlike some other breakfast spots in the city that enforce annoying rules about not seating people unless they are all present even when not crowded.  Thanks for being a refuge from silly rules!"}
{"text":"The West Side Market Cafe is a little diner found in the iconic West Side Market in Cleveland's Ohio City neighborhood. The place isn't very big but if you are patient enough to wait for a table, you will not be disappointed. The West Side Market Cafe is one of those places third shift workers find a beer at 8am, and the rest of the world finds a giant cup of piping hot coffee the second you sit down.

We visited the West Side Market Cafe in late September, just as the temperatures were beginning to drop and everybody brings pumpkin spice to their menus. The day I visited the cafe, Pumpkin Spice French Toast was the special and I wasted no time ordering it.

And my French Toast was delicious. The whipped cream and caramel drizzle was a super nice touch.

Mr. Beet ordered a very simple egg and cheese sandwich and he loved it.

We had also ordered both the breakfast potatoes and hash browns, as Mr. Beet  does love his starch at breakfast.  We both preferred the breakfast potatoes but you can't go wrong if hash browns are more your thing.

Did I mention the coffee? It was hot and it kept flowing. The service was impeccable.

The West Side Market Cafe is open for breakfast and lunch seven days a week (check the website for hours) and now serves dinner on Friday and Saturday nights. Five out of five sprouts."}
{"text":"I've been to the WSM Cafe on many occasions, and the food is always decent. I love that it's a small, independently owned staple of Cleveland. 

Usually, I get breakfast when I go since it's early and I'm trying to beat the crowds at the market on a Saturday (dear lord, why did I go on a Saturday?!?). This past week I was late and went for lunch. Both are good enough, but there were also major issues in each circumstance.

Here's a rundown of both breakfast and lunch:

Breakfast: What you would expect in a good way, nothing outstanding and nothing bad. Last time I went I ordered waffles and they came out burned and rock hard. When I told the waitress she said, 'I didn't want to serve it to you because I saw it was burned, but I'm not allowed to question the chef.' WHAT?!? She took them back and off the bill and I got my typical eggs/hash browns. Everyone was nice enough about it, buuuuuut... ok, whatever.

Lunch: I ordered the \"My Big Greek Chicken Wrap\" Here is the exact description from their site and the menu:
\"grilled chicken, romaine, diced tomatoes, feta, cucumbers, red onions, and kalamata olives tossed in Greek vinaigrette\"
Let me be clear, it was good, HOWEVER, there were only 3 olives in the whole wrap, they weren't chopped up, left whole, and only about 2 tablespoons of chicken with a small smattering of cucumbers and tomatoes. I'm not even exaggerating. If you're going to give me what amounted to a salad wrap, albeit a tasty one, don't bill it as having chicken and don't charge me $10!!!!

I will never go back for lunch because of the above, especially since my husband got a corned beef sandwich and it was teeny tiny for what we paid and he left hungry. 

Stick with breakfast (not the waffles)."}
{"text":"If you're looking for ever-so-subtly elevated diner fare, the West Side Market Cafe is a good choice! On our first visit, we sampled: 

- Hungarian Hash - a great Cleveland-style spin on the classic diner breakfast dish
- Shrimp and Grits
- Market Breakfast
- Corned Beef Hash 
- cups of some truly unappealing bitter, watery coffee - No refills, please.

The service was prompt and efficient and the meal was tasty and not too greasy. The main draw for me was convenient access to browsing the WSM after the meal!"}
{"text":"Ask if they have the seafood chowder and if they do...GET IT!!! It is soooooo hearty, chunky, and delicious! Tons of seafood and veggies. The portions are big, the prices are good, the food is tasty, and the service was fast and friendly. I definitely plan on coming back when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came to Cleveland to see the Cleveland Cavaliers get beat by my San Antonio Spurs. We arrived around 1 pm to get lunch before the game. Most restaurants in the area were booked for at least an hour and unable to sit 2 people for lunch. West Side Market was able to seat us right away. I got the chicken and waffle that had very different batter than normal. I didn't like waffle that came with it so I requested the normal waffle which was not very special. The chicken was better than I could make so that was great. The service was good as well. Lots of TVs to watch sports games if that interests you."}
