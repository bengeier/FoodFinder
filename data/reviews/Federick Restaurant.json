{"text":"Really good place introduced by my coworkers. It's quite the drive from the office but it's worth the trip for lunch.   I've been during lunch, they have special combos for a good price - and lots of options.  Dinner is reasonably priced, not as great as lunch pricing.   Love the chicken pakoras, manchurian chow mein, Szechwan fried rice, and chilli chicken.   Great place for large gatherings as it is family style - order a ton and sample everything."}
{"text":"The food served here is awesome, one of the best Hakka Chinese restaurant in Toronto.  friendly service, food portions are huge and price are reasonable.  I will surely recommend everyone to have a try at this beautiful and clean  restaurant . All the dishes are good,  Chilli Chicken and chicken pakora  are the must try items in this restaurant. ."}
{"text":"Chilli chicken.   Now, I've had chili chicken before at other places (Lee's Wok, Tangerine, China Cottage, Wanlees, etc), but the one at Federick is just at another level. Right amount of spice, but the sauce is what really blows it away. I don't know what they put in it, but it keeps bringing me back. If you go for the lunch special, it's only around 6.75 after tax and you get a free can of pop.   Overall, 5 stars for the chili chicken (sadly that's the only thing I've gotten at Federick - It's just too good)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is OK. I got here around 6 pm and the restaurant was completely full but the wait to be seated wasn't too long. I waited about 5 minutes before i was served.   I ordered the Chilli Chicken, Chicken pakoras and my boyfriend got pineapple chicken and General Tsao beef. (general tsao beef is not listed on the menu but you can order it)  We waited about 20 minutes before the food arrived which is okay considering the fact that the restaurant was packed but the odd thing is the waitress kept coming ojt to confirm wht our order was. I think they forgot we placed an order.   The chilli chicken was OK. I personally wouldn't order it again. It was a bit too bland for my liking.   The Chicken pakoras were also just OK. It did taste better than the Chilli Chicken but not good enough to order again.   I came to this restaurant becauae of the positive reviews but it honestly doesnt live up to the hype.   (p.s i didn't try my boyfriends food becsuae he was mad at me so i cant review his meal lol)"}
{"text":"There Crispy Beef is worst!!!!!! But will go back for other dishes.  3 start because of crispy beef."}
{"text":"Great choice of dishes, clean place and great taste. I'm a regular customer, usually call in for take-out. My preferred dishes are   -Manchurian mixed fried rice (with extra vegetables like broccoli/bok choi for extra $1) -Veggie delight -pakora -chilli chicken dry white meat (gravy on the side for extra $2) -Singapore noodles"}
{"text":"Hands down best Hakka food in town. I always get take out chilli chicken dry and chicken pakora since dine in is usually busy during dinner time."}
{"text":"Pricy compared to the smaller guys in area but you get good flavor and great athmosphere."}
{"text":"It was our first visit to Federick's after our friend raved about this place.  We have tried all the Hakka Chinese places in this corner of Markham. Tangerines China cottage Golden china  Federicks has the nicest decor I think , since it is the newest. I would go back with a group of friends as it can accommodate large groups.   In terms of food, it is pretty good, but I still like golden china the best for being unpretentious, and having  great tasting, great value food...their lunch combos include soup and drink, but Federick's only includes a pop."}
{"text":"This is the new location of the Scarborough restaurant.  The decor is much improved.  The chicken pakora was great! I wanted to order another set. The chicken balls also had a great set of meat.  We went on a Thursday night and it was packed. There were people waiting at the door for up to 20 minutes!  It was noisy and the music was also playing pretty loud.  They had sports playing on the tvs on the wall.  I have to say, given that every seat was full, plus there was a line up, those waitresses were constantly clearing out our table of six of empty serving dishes and plates.    I recommend this place"}
{"text":"Great Food Sweet and sour chicken balls. Two Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Ate here for Saturday night dinner.  I live in a different city now, but every time I go home I always make sure we make a trip to Federick! The food is unbelievable.  For about 13 people the bill came out to $160 and we were all very full by the end of it and were still able to take some left over food home!   We ordered the famous chicken pakora, hot and sour soup, wonton soup, vegetarian soup, manchurian chicken fried rice, manchurian fish, chili chicken (of course), seafood fried rice.  All the dishes were amazing.  The food came out in an orderly fashion and the dishes were nice and hot.    Since it was a Saturday night 7pm dinner, we had to wait about 30 minutes before we got a table, but since I went with such a large group we were able to keep ourselves entertained for that length of time.  I had called ahead to see if they make reservations and they had told me they did not, so I would double check before going to make sure they do or not, it might change depending on the night you go on.    The service is always amazing.  The staff members are funny, polite, and professional.  They are also very kid friendly (they have special plastic spoons for kids! How awesome is that?!).  I can definitely say that this place has the best Hakka food!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good especially when you consider the prices. The place has great to core and an extensive menu. Probably one of the better bargain places in Markham. The waitstaff struggles with English and can be difficult to order from at times, but again this is forgivable because the prices are fair.  I would recommend checking it out if you're in the area but there's nothing about this place it's going to blow you away."}
{"text":"Based on price and value 5* Based on taste and quality 3.5*   They are one of the best priced restaurants out there.   Yet, there are some simple things about American Chinese food they cannot get right...like the sweet & sour chicken isn't fried right, or the lemon chicken similarly isn't quite there...you almost wonder if they ever knew how to cook the chinese leaning dishes righ!?   On the other hand there are Hakka dishes that are good and the American Chop Suey is great and totally consistent."}
{"text":"Food quality and taste have gotten worse over the last few years, last time they forgot my chili chicken on my take out order......it'll be a while before I decide to come back here."}
{"text":"Been a Frederick's loyal customer for years. Ate at Bellamy and Ellesmere location and was thrilled when they opened this location in Markham.Absolutely love the pakora and chili chicken but everything on their menu is great. An awesome Hakka Chinese place close to home for a good price."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! You get lots for your order and the food taste yummy and clean!!!! One of our favourite food spots!!!"}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant but worth the wait. White Chilli chicken is the best. Also their fried rice are good. Hot and Sour soup was also very good to start with. Do call ahead with a reservation though."}
{"text":"My family LOVES this place! We have been coming to Federicks since forever,  when the scarborough location first opened. Then years later,  they opened a location in markham..meaning we ended up there at least twice a month!  My favourites are manchurian chicken,  ginger beef, chicken pakoras and chicken corn soup! Delicious,  large portions and very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Best indian Chinese around! Classics are shrimp pakora and chilli chicken. $"}
{"text":"Taste buds change as you get older and the food that you loved and craved in younger years is just not the same. I will try not to be to harsh on this review, instead compare with other Hakka cuisines I experienced.  Takeout Experience.  Hakka food as we know is usually greasy, spicy and most of the good tasting menu selections are fried.  Sweet fried noodles are really tasty and less greasy than others. The noodles have a nice chewy texture which is really pleasing to the palette.  I would definitely choose chinese style deep fried spicy salted squid over this one. It's less oily, the batter is lighter so it soaks up less greasy.   The dry chilli chicken is what it is, greasy & spicy. It tastes great and has a nice punch of spice which hit the taste buds without overwhelming heat.  Spicy fried green beans came out way too soggy and loaded with grease. shanghai style would be the better choice.  All in all compared to Tangerine, Frederick's still better and would be my choice for Hakka cravings.  The reason I gave this location 3/5 is because when we got home and opened up our take out, the hot noodles were so hot is melted a hole through the bottom of the Styrofoam container. That's a huge fail, should lined the container with tin foil like all the other restaurants do.  Customer service was ok. They opened up the ticket for takeout before even offering us a menu, standing there annoyed that we had to look through the menu for the items that we wanted. When the food arrived, They never offered, napkins, takeout utensils or extra sauces. I guess customer service is really dependant on where you are located. I never have a problem in Richmond Hill, Leaside, West end Markham.  In my opinion Frederick's do provide good food for reasonable prices. I hope they don't get to bigheaded and lose their focus on what got them to this point; loyal support.  Herman"}
{"text":"Update: The shrimp manchurian fried rice is still unreal however I switched it up and ordered the dark meat chilli chicken and surprisingly it is quite lacklustre. In a PERFECT world, China Cottage's extra spicy chilli chicken dry and Federicks manchurian fried rice = game over"}
{"text":"Good place to go for Hakka food. Service wasn't the best but it was prompt and precise. Very fast paced place so you may feel slightly rushed. Take out may be a better option if you don't like eating quickly. Modern interior and clean."}
{"text":"Monday night at 8:30 and place is packed! First time at this location. Fish Pakora, chili chicken dry and general tao beef.  Fish pekora was okay,  but very salty and spongy, not crispy enough. Chili chicken was alright.  It seemed pretty tasty as we were eating it, but afterward felt like we really didn't get such a good meal. General tao beef had a burnt taste to it.  We didn't ask for it dry and it came that way, so maybe that's why it tasted so burnt, but still not acceptable.  Service took about 20 minutes before we got our food.  Overall, we won't be seeing this place again."}
{"text":"Best Hakka food you can get other than your grandma cooking it!  Seen some ppl complain about service but the place is soo busy they can only do so much.  I always get the lunch take out. Sometimes it might take a couple tries to call in your take out order but it's definitely worth it.  Lunch special menu is amazing you wont find better food for that price!  Do yourself a favor and order the chili chicken lunch special you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We literally just left: we were looking for Chinese food in the area and came across this restaurant.  Parking: lots of parking spots as its part of a plaza The atmosphere was nice, good for a casual date, family dinner. Stroller friendly somewhat. There could be more seating, I can imagine it gets packed weekends.  The food was very delicious, had a mix of some spicy dishes and not so spicy. Both were good, although their menu has a lot of spicy food options.  We ordered:  Chicken fried rice - really good, chunks of chicken, well cooked General Tao - mild spicy, crispy, sauce was nice  Spicy Green Beans - over killed the chilli peppers won't get this again Cant Chow Mein - crispy noodles, but the sauce lacked some flavour  Shanghai dry shrimp - really good, crispy and big shrimp  Wonton soup - simple but delicious  Overall: I would definitely come back and would recommend to anyone who wants good Chinese food and can handle some heat   Service was great too, got our orders pretty quick and the servers were quick to clean up and check up on us. We were a group of 6.  This definitely a spicy/ Hakka Chinese food restaurant."}
{"text":"Cheap and tasty, huge portion sizes, chicken pakora, soup, chilli chicken and hakka noodles. Never fails to impress ! Best Hakka in the GTA, no competition"}
{"text":"Visited Federick Markham with my family, as my son already was there with his friends and said it worth a try. The restaurant is small but well decorated, clean and busy, we have to wait few minutes to be seated even we came around 3:00 pm after the Sunday's lunch rush hour. The food was served quick & the dishes looks huge & just hot from the pot. we ordered 4 dishes for 4 people & it's really too much. Liked the Beef Chow Mein & the Beef with cashew nuts, be careful with the Manchurian Beef fired rice if you are not a hot dishes lover, it's very hot but very tasty... the best dish was the General Tao Chicken, very juicy & well marinated. The price is very good for the amount of food served... will try it again for sure"}
{"text":"i can eat the chili chicken for daaaaaaaays the Manchurian noodles are pretty bomb as well if you're into fat noodles"}
{"text":"My husband and I went on a Tuesday evening around 6pm and were seated right away. The place had its good share of customers, but there was still ample seating.  Just like the other reviewers have said, the servers did not look like they enjoyed their job, but they did what was needed.  We ordered the mushroom fried rice and the chili chicken. It was nice that you can request for the chili chicken to be mild. Portions were amazing. We had to pack up about 1/4 of each dish at the end. The food tasted very flavourful (lots of MSG?)~ but it also tasted like what you could get at a Chinese food court for 1/2 the price.  Given the ambiance and the decor, I would say the prices were decent for the portions they serve. However, there was nothing that impressive with their food~"}
{"text":"Dined in; nice decor.  Got pretty busy as the night went on, esp. take out.  Being Hakka, I was disappointed with the chilli chicken as all of the pieces were not crispy and gravy was too sweet.  The Hakka sweet noodles (foong me mein) was on point though."}
{"text":"Excellent food but we had the rudest waiter. I am visiting from Miami and always look forward to good Chinese food when I am here. Although the food was good, my experience was tainted by the rude waiter who answered my father with \"obviously\" when he asked about the vegetables in the vegetarian noodles."}
{"text":"I love dining at this place! The chicken pakora is my absolute favourite! It used to be a lot spicier, but it seems that they have skimped out on the chunks of green fresh chillies within the batter and the pakoras are a lot smaller than they used to be.  I will try the Scarborough location again, as I feel like they are more generous with the portions.  Have tried other dishes as well at both locations and I've never been disappointed when it comes to the flavourings.  Affordable, delicious, a must try!"}
{"text":"Always come for the chicken pakoras and chilli chicken! My favourite Hakka food restaurant.   Never had a problem with service or their food. Also a lot of parking and sometimes the restaurant can get very busy and you may have to line up."}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese Hakka. Fabulous service and very quick to bring fresh hot delicious food out to us. Serves are very nice, clean restaurant with great ambiance."}
{"text":"I don't know hakka very well, but I thought this must be a good place for people to crowd the door before the restaurant even opens.  It was very simple inside, and I ordered singapore noodles.  Very tasty indeed, and not too greasy or salty.   I hope to come back, and try more items off the menu."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  My favourite place to go for lunch special. They're usually pretty busy, and you have to wait a bit for a seat. The portions are pretty big and so good for the price"}
{"text":"Hakka food at its core is its grease and spice, and it's pretty well done here. The restaurant is still pretty busy an hour until closing, so I expected quality food as soon as I sat down.   As others have said, the chili chicken is pretty good. The chicken is still pretty juicy and flavourful despite the heavy use of spices.   My only real complaint of the food menu is there is virtually no option for non-spicy vegetables. Since all the dishes are spicy I was hoping to get a regular veggie dish but had to resort to spicy vegetables instead. It's still good, I just wish there is some variety.   Other than that, i couldn't help but notice strong gusts of wind coming through the restaurant (from the back kitchen side?) during our meal. While this had nothing to do with the food, it made my experience a little less enjoyable because this was during -20 weather in the middle of the winter and we all had our jackets off indoors."}
{"text":"I agree with most of the reviews. Great food, really cheap, absolutely worth it.  Seems like there is very little or no msg on their food. On the downside, msg does enhance the flavor so I did find the everything a tad blander than in a typical hakka restaurant. On the upside, there is no msg! I did not feel sick after the meal. As stated in several posts, what is served here seems healthier."}
{"text":"What started as a need for a post-Costco lunch has quickly turned into a family favourite! Tasty food that is an unbelievably good value! For three of us (adults), we usually get three items and share, with enough leftovers for almost two full meals afterwards. The food is flavourful, spicy but not overly so (though I'm sure you can add more spice if you'd like), and the wine is really well-priced (extra bonus!). Definitely recommended, for a post-Costco lunch, or otherwise :)"}
{"text":"Had Lunch here just before Christmas 2015. Tried the Manchurian Chicken and a shrimp dish. Both dishes were good; a little milder than expected. Service was prompt though unremarkable otherwise. Would gladly try again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a Hakka Chinese restaurant (Hakka is an ethnic group from China know for being world travellers over 1000 years old)  Try Chilli chicken with or without gravy. Awesome chicken wings."}
{"text":"Go to dish is definitely the chicken pakora! No other Hakka  restaurant  comes close to matching their chicken pakora dish.  Can't go wrong with thier chili chicken as well.  I prefer the Markham location over their Scarborough location as it's newer and more modern. It's actually a nice environment to sit in.  Place is always busy so don't expect it to be quiet."}
{"text":"I am not sure why so-called Hakka cuisine is found in the Greater Toronto Area and Calgary, but is not as popular in the U.S. My introduction to Hakka (or more accurately, Indian-Chinese food)  at Federicks this afternoon was quite a delight. Chili spiced chow mein and fried rice, pakoras, and chili chicken were very tasty. To my uninitiated palate, the spice profiles on Chinese cuisine were extremely intriguing.  Perhaps it is my unfamiliarity with Canadian Hakka cuisine, but I must say Federicks is a winner!  Now, I must find some of this Indian-Chinese fusion chow in the U.S.!"}
{"text":"The best Hakka food anywhere at a very reasonable price. If you are a fan of pakora's, give their chicken ones a try, also the chilli beef is to die for"}
{"text":"I was overly excited to pick up lunch today from the NEW Federick's location. The difference in time from when I first heard there was a new location, to me actually being in there, was less than 45 minutes.   I was stoked to say the least. It's like hearing for example Aunties & Uncles opened up a new location in Richmond Hill, to me that would be big tings!   Ambiance and décor at this new location is the exact opposite of the OG location. It's sleek, welcoming and clean. It's truly a new and improved location in nearly every way.   Chicken Pakora's were strikingly on point. For the price, the portions are banging. They had to use a rubber band to keep my take out container closed because they put that much chicken in it.   Chili chicken was not bad, a little overcooked, great colour, but slightly under seasoned. A few pinches of salt or soy glaze would have made the world of difference.   Crab corn soup was not bad, I've had better but overall it wasn't bad.   Rice noodles with beef were solid. I was expecting flat rice noodles similar to a pad thai noodle or ban pho, but this was closer to a vermicelli, still very good.   Chicken fried rice was seasoned well and appetizing. I know you may think there is not much you can do with this dish but trust me, I've had some terrible experiences.   Finally, service was great. All the staff I spoke with were courteous and helpful, I can't say the same about the OG location.   If I had to choose from now on I would only go to the Markham location, not that it will affect the traffic in Scarborough, both these restaurants will kill it going forward.   No question the best hakka I have ever had is Szechuan Gourmet, don't get it twisted."}
{"text":"Portion is great and so is the price.  Food was decent but nothing out of ordinary.  Our waitress was genuinely uninterested to provide any service.  Will try some other Hakka place next time."}
{"text":"This is a great Hakka restaurant. The Manchurian beef is tasty, and I've liked most of the other dishes I've had here.  It has a great atmosphere and always seems busy."}
{"text":"You were the first Hakka place I know and the only one that makes traditional Hakka food!  You never compromise your dishes to western influences.  Your staff is always polite, friendly and committed to getting the food in our hands quickly and ensuring the food is always fresh and hot! Highly recommend the Chili Chicken and Chicken Pokora!"}
{"text":"I won't wade into the authentic Hakka vs. South Asian Chinese fusion debate, but I will say that Federick (not Fred) is my fave spicy hakka chinese joint in the city, bar none. Since they renovated both locations, it's a decent date atmosphere, if a bit crowded and hectic, and the food is second to none. Not upscale and fussy, it's large portions of well-prepared, hearty, spicy deliciousness.  Standouts include the best-in-the-city Chicken Pakora, intense dry Chili Chicken, addictive Kan Shue Green Beans, and my guilty pleasure, the Lunch Special Sweet & Sour Shrimp, over fried rice. The regular sweet and sour shrimp are large and bouncy, but the lunch special shrimp are smaller, but there is an obscene number of shrimp for $6!  Truth is that I've never had a dish I didn't love here.  Go! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Always come here with the family, it's always really busy but service is quick and efficient.   Favourites are the chicken pakoras and chili chicken. We usually get beef with green beans  too which is also great.   Everything else is the normal Chinese food fare, but extra stars for the chili chicken and pakoras... They're so good."}
{"text":"I ordered for pick up for a party of 12 hungry adults. When I got there to pick up the food, I didn't have time to check the bags or trays to make sure everything I paid for was in there (I always check just to be safe) because I was in such a rush. The staff assisted me by asking me to pull up to the front so they can help me put all the food in my car. Once I got to the house and laid all the food out on the table, I was thoroughly impressed at: 1) Everything I ordered was there and with generous portions 2) Everything was DELICIOUS - no complaints! 3) Customer service was exceptional - from the moment I called to order to the moment I got to the restaurant to pick up the food   P.S. My parents are long-time customers of Federick's. Now I see why :)"}
{"text":"Some good s**t.  Chili chicken? Hell yeah.  Been to their Scarborough location a few years back and had a good experience.  As expected, this location was good too.  Great hakka food at great prices.  They say they open at 11am but I was at the door at 11am and it wasn't open though, quite misleading on that part. Good experience overall."}
{"text":"Came in for some takeout one night, and came away pretty impressed with the food. Didn't sit in, but the restaurant was larger than expected, and seated quite a few people. Lots of servers bustling around back and forth, moving quite quickly.  In terms of the food, the Chicken Pakora was definitely the best, with lots of flavor. The other dishes we got were the Szechuan Beef, Mango Chicken, and Vegetable Fried Rice. All were very good, but it would have been nice to know that the 2 dishes came with rice, so we wouldn't have to order the fried rice.   The staff while we were waiting for the food were not exactly welcoming though. They never smiled once, didn't explain anything, and one even pumped into my friend as he barreled into the washroom. The food did prep relatively quickly though, and 10% off for takeout was a nice additional.  Overall, great food and will probably order takeout again. Just may not come by for dine in when the staff all seem to hate being there."}
{"text":"Great food, nice ambiance, service was very decent too. I hear complaints about line ups but we escaped that mess. The food is hakka Chinese. So if you are craving fried, heavily sauced, spicy hot Indo/Chinese. This is your spot. They have their staple dishes but don't be scared to try some of the other ones. We tried a fish it was light compared to the other dishes and tasted great. Wish they would open a branch in Hamilton"}
{"text":"Always a good choice for quality Hakka food! While it tends to get busy around dinner time, both on weekends and weekdays, the wait for a while table is typically well worth and the staff are quick to serve nonetheless. Portions for the price are quite reasonable. A popular dish is the chicken pakora, which I highly recommend! You can't go wrong with their wide selection of vegetables, fish, chicken, and beef dishes. However, having eaten there numerous times, I did find the dishes to be particularly oily. Having requested to have my dishes cooked with less oil, the waiter agreed, however, this message was not relayed to the kitchen staff, as my dish came out just as oily as in previous dining experiences. Overall, a good restaurant for a casual Hakka Food experience."}
{"text":"We got takeout from Federick yesterday night.  I had the Chicken Pakora, Kan Shue Green Beans, and the Shrimp Fried Rice.  Despite some of the reviews that attracted me to the restaurant, I wasn't blow away by the pakora, which seemed to be one of the more popular items. Don't get me wrong though, it was all quite tasty and I enjoyed it thoroughly, but I'm not itching to take anyone there.  The portions and the price are great! The chicken fried rice for $6.50 is enough for a meal by itself, and the quality of the food seemed pretty high. Other prices: Chicken Pakora ($8.50), Kan Shue Green Beans ($7.5)  \"A-OK\" captures it perfectly."}
{"text":"The food tastes great when it's served fresh, but I ALWAYS feel sick afterwards. I'm not sure if they overkill the msg or other additives but I always react to the food after I eat there."}
{"text":"Food was decent nothing special, sweet and sour chicken was not sour but the general tao chicken was good, usually at hakka places the chicken is deep friend mixed with sauce but Frederick's was different chicken was pan fried but the food was a little over priced for what it was."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Mediocre food. Unnessary costs. To be blunt, I didn't have the best experience.   I came here as a group of 9.  They made us pay a service charge even though we didn't want to. They said it's okay, we don't have to pay for tips. The servers barely paid any attention to us throughout our whole visit.   The foods tasted mediocre. I got a curried paneer dish. It tasted as if it didn't even have salt. I also had some soup and fried rice. The fried rice tasted as if it was burnt and the vegetables were too hard to chew. The soup was not good at all, we didn't even finish it."}
{"text":"I have ordered food to go from this location several times and the food has been really good. However, I had gone with my friends to dine in and we had the worst experience ever.  First of all, we ordered a medium corn soup, which tasted good and arrived within a decent time. But, everything went downhill after that. It took an extremely long time for our food to arrive. Our manchurian vegetable chow mein arrived after almost 45 mins. Then our vegetable pakora arrived 20 mins after the chow mein. And the steamed rice that was supposed to arrive with the vegetable pakora did not arrive til we were half way done our meal. My other friend had ordered a special for one which did not arrive til an hour later. We were seated at 6:30 and we did not leave til 9:15 and we spent most of this time waiting for the food. It was a total disaster!  The vegetable pakora was really good. However, the manchurian vegetable chow mein was horrible. They literally dumped a disgusting amount of salt on it and I usually dont complain about salt as i use a lot in my food.   We later ordered dessert hoping this would make things better. But that was a horrible decision on our part. We had ti remind the staff what we had ordered twice and they said it was on its way. However, the group of people that were seated after us got their main meal, dessert and were ready to leave while we were still waiting for our dessert. The cherry on top was when they brought our bill which included the dessert yet we had not gotten our dessert.   My friend got frustrated and so she took the bill and spoke the staff. They apologized, had to come back and ask for our order again. A staff who seemed to be in charge had brought the dessert and apologized. We were not happy but did not want to cause a scene.   We got the fried pineapple and ice cream and the fried banana and ice cream. It was definitely not the best.  Despite all of this the staff were pretty friendly, but i dont think i would go back to dine in."}
{"text":"Well this place takes me back. Discovered the restaurant in 2012, and has been my go to Hakka restaurant since then. While not without it's flaws, I definitely consider federicks to be one of the best Hakka restaurant within the York Region area.  Food: While they do have a wide variety dishes to choose from, my go to items will always be any of their Pakora dishes, consisting of a number of deep fried meats or vegetables, I would consider them great starters for anyone unfamiliar with Indian cuisine.  Who can forget Chilli Chicken; if you're a big fan of Hakka food, then you should know that if you going to be eating at one of these joints, you have to try their chilli chicken. I repeat this is must try dish! Be warned though, it is not for the faint of heart. This dish can be killer if you're not prepared for spicy food, but it can also be terribly addictive.  Service: Attentive and fast service, with my experience at the restaurant, I ever rarely had to flag down a server for something that I needed. Conversation with the wait staff was never really thing, but the restaurant is more about speedy service if anything.  Atmosphere: Simple decor, nothing fancy. Dining area can get very loud and not much intimacy in the restaurant. More suited for Hangouts and family gatherings, you wouldn't be bringing someone here for a first date.  Recommendation: One of the best Hakka joints in the York Region area so I would suggest stopping here before heading to other Hakka restaurant."}
{"text":"i've always liked the food here but had a pretty uncomfortable experience today. ordered pick-up over the phone and spoke to someone that was probably exhausted and wasn't speaking clearly. asked for a mild manchurian chicken and he somehow heard manchurian plus chilli chicken. when he repeated the order to me it was completely mumbled but i assumed since i had spoken clearly he knew what i wanted and confirmed. when i got there they had added chilli chicken to my order and when i told them that i hadn't ordered that it got really awkward. the guy i spoke with was pretty rude when he asked me why i confirmed when he repeated the order. i told him i didn't hear him properly but assumed he knew what i said, not wanting to say he wasn't speaking clearly in front of the crowd of employees staring at me. as he fixed my order he looked up at me like i was scum that was dirtying the floors of their restaurant. i left feeling very unwelcomed and probably won't return any time soon. i just don't feel like it was as a big a deal as it was made to be and the looks i was given weren't deserved"}
{"text":"Nothing special but huge portions with low prices   Came here for take-out and got the Manchurian fried rice and chilli chicken.. I think I had enough food to feed myself for the next 3 meals.. the Manchurian fried rice was good but I was expecting way more flavour considering how red it was. The chilli chicken also seemed underseasoned even though the entire thing was covered in gravy lol.   Was also here for lunch one day, the place had a decent amount of people coming in and out for lunch with also a few huge tables that seem to be regulars. I again got the chilli chicken with egg fried rice and a spring roll, again it was a little bland but nothing a little salt and pepper didn't fix. I walked out spending about $10 dollars and for the amount of food given I would come back just for the savings lol.   Service was friendly, staff are attentive when you need something and are always on top of things. Many customers know staff members by name and it's nice to see they have people that keep coming back"}
{"text":"Been back a few times now. This hidden hakka restaurant is probably one of the best in town. Hence why its so packed. Comfy, clean, big portion and reasonably priced. Definitely try the chili chicken and the manchurian fried rice. So addicting! The Singaporian noodles was really good too! Tasty and was not as greasy either. Yummy in my tummy!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight with my brother. We've never tried Chinese hakka food before, but have wanted to try it. Seen lots of good yelp reviews for this place, so we decided to come here.  Basically I'd describe it as  a twist on chinese food, like you'd get at a takeaway. But a lot of the dishes are spicy.  We ordered the chicken pakoras, chilli chicken, mushroom fried rice and hakka noodles. The pakoras were nicely seasoned and juicy. They were the best thing we ordered. I would come back to eat these again. The chilli chicken was ok, not to my liking. The kids loved the fried rice. I found it had a nice flavour but a bit too oily. The noodles were ok, a bit sweet tasting, similar to teriyaki. They were very oily too. Some people ordered sizzling hot plate dishes and the smoke filled up the restaurant. Need better ventilation if you're serving those type of dishes. My hair and clothes ended up smelling smokey.  There were lots of people ordering takeout and the restaurant was nearly all full. Prices are decent for the serving sizes. Not the type of food I'd normally eat but my kids enjoyed it. Would go again, if they requested it."}
{"text":"Pakoras and chilli chicken with rice is my must haves for this place. Super delicious :)  For pakoras, I order the combination plate, which includes fish, shrimp and chicken. The description on the menu mentioned beef and veggie pakoras as well, but I didn't find any in my plate, which is totally ok. Don't feel like I missed out because these 3 are yummy. I especially like the fish and shrimp ones actually. Plenty of meat in each piece and tasted really fresh and tender. Not over-fried or dry at all.  Very good portion for the price.  Decor is new and modern. Big contrast to the other first location. Washroom was clean with a Dyson dryer, which I didn't expect at this restaurant.  Service is quick.  Have yet to try other Hakka restaurants in the area, but I hope they do these dishes just as well.   Will come back again."}
{"text":"Best hakka restaurant in the GTA...hands down!  Their chilli chicken is bonkers...trust me! (even though I'm a complete stranger).  I would highly suggest the chicken pakoras too.  It's not a super fancy place so don't expect 5 star table placements...but the food makes it all worthwhile."}
{"text":"I used to frequent their original Scarborough location. I've visited this location a few times for both dine-in and take-out. Depending on when you arrive, the wait time can be long.  I find that Frederick can sometimes be a little inconsistent. Sometimes the portion are smaller than other days (chili-chicken) and sometimes less sauce too. I like my wet chili-chicken saucy!"}
{"text":"Federick's is one of those places you hate to love cuz the food, while so good, is just not good for you!  I dropped by for a weekday dinner and boy this place was hopping at 8:30pm, don't people cook at home anymore? We ordered a couple of cold beers, fish pakoras, chili chicken, and the hakka noodles! All dishes came out quick, hot, and of course generous in portion. We had enough left overs for lunch the next day.  And the price you may ask? Cheap! For the amount you get plus two beers with tip was about $40! About cuz I didn't pay and never saw the bill. That's what friends are for!"}
{"text":"Still the best Hakka anywhere but I noticed that if you order anything extra spicy they over do it.  I will say that their shrimp dishes destroy any Chinese restaurant in Markham/RH due to their size, cleanliness and beautiful butterflied preparation."}
{"text":"Service was great but when I got home..... It was a different story. My stomach hurt for hours. Not a fan of their dishes. I've had better Hakka."}
{"text":"This a nice place, always packed.  Food is great, not everything on the menu is upto par, but some simple dishes are done to perfection like the green beans, soup, and pakoras.  It's halal, and in the middle of Desi community.  The service is what I find very annoying, I know Asians don't like to talk much, but even to grab their attention, I have to yell across the restaurant for them to listen."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times before, always ordering the chicken pakora. It tastes amazing. But the I ordered 2 portions for takeout two days ago. I, along with 2 other friends were sick after eating the chicken pakora. I searched google them and sure enough, they have been charged with failure to protect food from contamination. The chicken pakoras are really delicious, and I have never had previous problems, but I will not be going back after last time."}
{"text":"I really enjoy picking up food here for takeout.  I usually order the chilli chicken, beef fried rice and another dish.  The chilli chicken all white meat is usually always good and just enough kick to it.  The fried rice is well fried rice you can't really go wrong.  The chicken pakora is another dish that is enjoyable.  Overall, everything is always usually good and the price is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Summary: popular Hakka dishes in big portion sizes are fairly tasty, although service is iffy and lighting is dim.  Top Must-Get: Manchurian Chicken Top Regret: Chicken Fried Rice  This is the most popular Hakka restaurant in an area full of them (three in that plaza)! We get seated pretty quickly for lunch, but I've been here for dinner and sometimes there's a wait. To be honest, it's good, but not worth waiting for.  First impressions? Dark and confusing. When you walk in, there are two doors. One (to the right) is for dine in, and the other (go straight) is for takeout, but it's easy to miss the signs because they opt for a dimmer ambience. Maybe it's supposed to be romantic, but I personally find it feeling moody and broody, especially since the service staff often look bored to match.  BUT TO THE POINT - the food. First thing, it's going to be a nice sized portion, and second thing, it's going to be drenched in sauce. I found out on my last visit, after ordering, that you can get it dry, and will be trying that next time - but the sauce does go well with rice, which comes with the lunch special. Food comes pretty fast and lunch comes with a pop of your choice.  Chili chicken is fairly good. Darker colour, lots of kick, and - with all the sauce - you can't really make out the tenderness or juiciness of the chicken, but it's good.  Manchurian chicken is like chili chicken but with less kick, more sweetness, and way more red sauce (which I think is just artificial colouring; it LOOKS spicier but definitely isn't).  Pakora (chicken) are pretty good. I think they deep fry peppers with the chicken altogether, because a pepper was caked in one of the fried exteriors - so it's definitely got a bit of spice, but not too hot. A bit more oily than I like, but that's most deep fry places.  The chicken fried rice was a little boring. Not a ton of flavour, somewhat dry, and the mixed veggies that came mixed in (carrots, peas, etc) were kind of bland. I'd pass on this dish.  Over all, pretty good for a quick, filling, saucy-somewhat-greasy meal!"}
{"text":"The food here has been very consistent over the years. Great place for mandarin... we have been coming for ever. Started at there first location and now on to this one. Do your taste buds a favour and get down here. The pakora is great."}
{"text":"[Before reading this review, please see my review for the original Federick's location.]  So it has finally happened. Federick's has another location. It only took them like 20 years. However I predict this location taking the #1 spot for any halal hakka food in the GTA (not including the original Federick's).  I would be surprised if any hakka fan has not yet visited the original location, so if you haven't - do yourself a favour and go. This review is for the new location... which does well in many areas but lacks in a couple.  The ambiance is nice. The original location was poorly spaced, old school tables and chairs. Tacky lighting. Poor layout (pushing through 10 take out patrons to enter the restaurant is pretty annoying!). The new location addresses these issues with a well designed, well decorated, and more spacious layout. They've even put up a TV and play the Leafs/Raptors games.  The food. Not as good as the original location. I hate to say it as I was expecting the Federick's that I grew up with and came to love. Don't get me wrong, it is still better than most hakka places I've been to, however I didn't get the signature Federick's taste. Probably because the new location has a different chef.  To start we ordered chicken pakoras, hot and sour soup, chicken corn soup and crab corn soup. For the main dishes we ordered Manchurian chicken chow mein, chicken fried rice, and their new bite-sized version of their signature sweet and sour chicken balls (side note: the first time I ordered the chicken balls they came cold on the inside however this time they were some of the best sweet and sour chicken balls I've ever had).   Though I prefer the chicken corn soup, the hot and sour soup and the crab corn soup were surprisingly good. The pakoras stellar as usual. The Manchurian chicken chow mein could have done with a bit more flavour as it was a little bland. And as mentioned the sweet and sour chicken balls were simply amazing.  The portions were quite large, and you won't get any complaints here. However by time time we left this place we were too stuffed to speak words.  Buyer's Beware: many have been known to eat more than humanly possible at Federick's."}
{"text":"I thought I had reviewed this restaurant, but it must've slipped my mind.  I have one thing to say about this place.  THIS. PLACE. IS. FREAKING. AMAZING.  BEST. HAKKA. IN. CANADA. HANDS. DOWN.  Eat everything. Everything is delicious.  My family's go-to place for any occasion.  My friends have travelled all across the GTA to dine here with me.  Other Chinese food is crap in comparision.  Nothing. Is. As. Good. As. This. Place.  YOU MUST HAVE:  Chili Chicken with Dark Meat. Chicken Pakoras Manchurian Chicken House Special Fried Rice The Chili Green Beans (i know, who orders that? BUT ITS DELICIOUS)  There's a pool of saliva on my desk right now.  'Nuff SAID!!  If you're scared and want to try this place, message me. I work a few blocks south, and am ALWAYS happy to go here.  I think I'm going to name my first born child Federick."}
{"text":"A lot of people are raving about this restaurant. The decor is nice and clean, modern and comfy, and the service is fast and friendly. But the food - didn't amaze me. It wasn't bad - at all but it wasn't amazing. It was just decent. We came as a group of four and were immediately seated. We ordered:  Canton Chow Mein ($9.00) - it was drier and a bit overcooked than we expected. We like crunchy chow mein but this was too much. As for flavour - average. But we've had better.  Deep fried squid  ($8.50) - it was yummy though we expected more of a crispy texture rather than a soft sort of spongy one.   Shrimp Fried Rice ($6.75) - was pretty delicious. Everyone enjoyed it. Good fried rice. Wouls recommend it.  Manchurian Fish  ($8.50) - this was my favourite dish though for others, it was too spicy. It was my first time trying it and I loved it. Full of flavour with a great spicy sauce. The fish is soft too and goes well with the fried rice. I recommend this dish - but beware the spice. Some will find it a bit much but it was great for me.   Overall, it was an average experience. The neighbourhood loves the place - whenever I pass by, there's always a good crowd. I've heard that the Scarborough location is better so I might just give that a try soon!"}
{"text":"Scarborough location : Service here is attentive : Always a waiter/waitress around the corner.  Great section of food choices on menu ... All sounds very delicious.  Started off Medium egg drop soup which was large : but mushrooms were from a can and there were tomatoes in it which was weird for my taste.  However dinner was excellent portions again large : shrimp fried rice. tasty.  Batter on shrimp main dish was extremely tasty highly addicting!!  Update: went to the location in Markham .. OILY !! Couldn't eat it .. Very disappointing. Tried it another time .. Same. Won't be back to that location."}
{"text":"Our favourite place to go for all-around good Hakka food. Quick and friendly service, and very generous with their portions, especially for takeout and catering."}
{"text":"I've been having takeout here regularly and have never been disappointed by Frederick's for Hakka chinese food. Simply put, the food is tasty, cheap, and plentiful. You can't go wrong with that.  We typically order one noodle or fried rice dish. I highly recommend the Manchurian style which is a mild combination of sweet and spicy. And you get a choice of two proteins too! The classic is with chicken and shrimp. There's always a healthy amount toppings in your fried rice and noodles; these are some hefty carb dishes. As for portion size, they give you enough to feed an extra two more people than you would think! We seem to get two extra bowls of white rice which is a nice gesture. Can't ever get enough carbs right?  I won't go into too much about the protein dishes here but the main idea with Indian Hakka food is that there isn't too much being done besides having your choice of protein in a certain sauce/style; the main proteins being chicken, beef, shrimp, and fish. My favourite here has to be the garlic sauce which is very savory. It's a somewhat sweet garlicky sauce. Besides that, the chicken pakora is very good here although I do recommend to have that at the restaurant for the maximum crispiness. In addition, the sizzling plates are also a good bet here. Again, I recommend to have that at the restaurant. You do get that extra iron skillet taste to it.   Some things to note: 10% off if you pay by cash for takeout orders. And minimum $15 purchase for debit use and $20 for credit use. You can also get fortune cookies for takeout which they will give to you, but only upon request."}
{"text":"Frequent go-to place for takeouts for get-togethers. Our faves - chicken with cashew, fish in wine sauce, mixed fried rice (chicken and shrimp). Service is fast and efficient. Staff members are very courteous as well.   As I watch them, everyone work as if they are a big clan/family working for the family business. I do not observe anyone just goofing off or have an attitude of \"I am just working here to pay the bills. Period.\" Amazing place to dine.   It can get busy so call in to reserve."}
{"text":"This place is very similar to Manchu Wok or Mandarin, as it's flavours are not too authentic. Everything is just deep-fried and tossed in bottled sauces. I could see how this appeals to a lot of people, but personally I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"3.0 stars   Never really tried Hakka food before because can't take spicy food.  But gave it a try anyways.  First of all the decor was clean and modern which was nice.  We had Hakka chow mein with chicken and shrimps not spicy and  portion was huge.  The Manchurian chicken was a bit spicy but I prefer more sweet and sour spicy which this was not.  The fried squid was really good if you like fried stuff."}
{"text":"Love coming here. very good prices for large portions! Staff have great memory of previous customers and automatically know my previous order! Always have a wonderful experience coming here and definitely will be coming back. The reason I deducted one star was because they do not deliver and when I have done takeout my food was soggy (Also the restaurant is really small, and the waiting time on weekends is around half an hour)."}
{"text":"Last night I went to Federick's with my friend's family because we were craving some good Hakka food. I absolutely love Hakka and whenever I mention it, the name Federick's always seems to pop up. Even though I've seen the Scarborough location several times, I've never went in and ordered anything. My Go-To Hakka spot has always been Lucky's by Scarborough Golf Club & Lawrence.  So, when my friend's mother mentioned heading to Federick's (the Markham location) I was game! :)  The spot was packed and people were lining up waiting to chow down. Luckily the parent's got there earlier and saved a table. The seating is quite crowded in this place. I'm someone who's quite aware of my surroundings and I actually hit two other patron's while trying to just get out of my seat. Our waiter came and took our order. We ordered 4 dishes and the first one came out rather quickly. Unfortunately the next dishes didn't come out until 10 minutes later. Wasn't a huge fan of that as I usually like to eat all the dishes at the same time and not in sections.  The food was very good though. Very comparable to Lucky's! The chili chicken didn't have as much heat as Lucky's does. Lucky's offers an option of making it  \"Spicy\" even though chili chicken is quite hot, they \"Spicy\" option has LOTS of heat! Federick's doesn't offer this option so the chicken was rather tame but still quite tasty. We also ordered veggie friend rice, chicken chow mein and crispy chicken. All of those dishes were enjoyable as well.  Once we asked for the bill, it took about 10-15 minutes which was also quite annoying. It's a busy spot so I see how chaotic it can get, but I think they should look into expanding the store so that we aren't constantly jabbing people with the close seating. The atmosphere in Markham was a lot cleaner then the one in Scarborough but that is understandable as the Markham location is still fairly new.  The prices are also very reasonable. About $40 for 4 dishes to feed a family of 5 isn't bad at all!  I would recommend ordering for take-out as opposed to dining though. The slow disorganized service and crowded seating takes away from really enjoying the food."}
{"text":"Great place!!! The ambience is a big difference from their Scarborough location on Bellamy.  The food is always great, the place is clean, though the only draw back is that it's a small place.  Got to try their Chicken Hakka chow mein, sweet hakka chow mein, chili chicken, crispy beef, and fish in red wine sauce.. Probably one of more popular Hakka restaurants in the GTA."}
{"text":"I visited this location of Frederick for the first time yesterday for take out. Being promised a wait of 15-20 minutes, I found myself and others waiting for over 45 minutes. While no apologies were given, the next batch of customers were also quoted the same 15-20 minute wait.   The food was just okay. My chili fish was sub-par and watery, the Manchurian Pakoras were overly soft and undercooked and the other dishes were over salted and full of food colouring. Make sure to order plenty of drinks if you'll be heading to Frederick, -after a single bite of anything your mouth will feel like you've swallowed a bit of the dead sea.   If you like shoddy, rude service and overrated food by all means head to Frederick. I've even had a more satisfactory meal at Tangerine's during their lunch specials."}
{"text":"For recently discovering Hakka food and how good it can be, Federick did not live up to my expectations. Having ordering the kung pao chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and garlic chicken, these dishes came in a small amount but what really disappointed me was how small the meats were cut up into. You could practically feed a baby these small diced chicken. The kung pao chicken's description claimed that it'd be spicy but there was barely any spice contents added to the chicken. Finally, all the chicken dishes ordered came out to be very saucy and I couldn't taste the crispiness due to the fact it was pan fried.   The service was not the best given the fact that we could see a good bunch of the employees relaxing and sitting on their phones. First impressions really do matter to a customer, with that being said, I had a bad experience at Federick. They're better Hakka places to try..."}
{"text":"If you can get over the cold service, this place serves up some pretty good Hakka food."}
{"text":"Huge portions at affordable prices, but comes at a cost.  I usually come in for their lunch special as they're just down the street.  I've tried a few of their specials but my go-to is always the Manchurian chicken with rice.  It's full of flavour, not too spicy and comes in a generous portion. The lunch special also comes with a drink, either chinese tea or a selection of pop.  While I normally get take-out, I did try staying in one day. The restaurant had a good number of people coming in and out for lunch, wait time was minimal. While the food portions and pricing is very appealing, I did find the service to be a bit lacking.  I'm not sure if they're just short staffed, but I find that the waiters can sometimes be a little less than friendly unless you're asking for the bill.  I would still recommend this place for affordable Hakka food in the Markham area, but primarily for the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Our group decided to get the Combo 3 (spicy - although not so spicy for my taste level but others felt it was) so that it would allow us to try a variety of dishes - the chilli chicken, green beans (absolute heaven in your mouth!), Manchurian beef, hot & sour soup and then dessert we ended up getting both the deep friend banana and pineapple.  I've had deep fried banana before, but never deep friend pineapple and it was just lovely!  We also ordered their Chicken pakoras - which out divine.  I think this is one of their more popular dishes  This is their other location (first one in Scarborough) and unless that location renovated, this one is a waaaaaaaay better atmosphere - it actually looks like a nice place to eat and not a little dive.  The service is decent and the food comes out faaaast - no waiting here!  I have been here a few times - but all for dinner - and there is generally a line up.  Lunch time is pretty ok.  There is also a take out option available as well.    I believe during the weekdays they have lunch specials, but I went on a weekend and don't believe those are available then."}
{"text":"If you like hakka (spicy Chinese)  food then is the place, chicken pakora and chillie chicken a must"}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear these guys opened a new place in Markham. I used to take out from there Scarboro place back in the day and fondly remember their chicken pakora as one of my favourite all time dishes.   A nurse I worked with introduced me to hakka cuisine way back then. It was her family who owned Frederick. We had a hard time deciding what to get from the long list of delicious options on the menu. Of course we got the chili chicken. Can't go wrong there. The chicken pakora although very good was not the same as I remembered it. The mee goreng with squid was really my favourite. The manchurian beef was maybe a little too spicy. We were warned.   When I went in to pick up my order, the place was hopping. Lots of people picking up and eating in the large dining area. If you like Chinese and Indian food, you've got to give Frederick a try."}
{"text":"Not so good. Tried it twice. Too inappropriately too saucy. Too salty on some dishes and flavourless on some other dishes. The seating was comfortable and service decent but I cannot go back as not only did I feel this way but also my in-laws, my husband and my kids. We all had the same appraisal."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom yesterday for lunch, and it's still the same Federick as when they started like 20 years ago . Chili Chicken, Manchurian Shrimp Noodle and Shrimp Pakora were on point.   Definitely went down memory lane... and the service was fantastic. Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Ordered take out here yesterday and the food was Average AT BEST.  Crispy Beef - SKIP THIS AS IT IS HORRIBLE Manchurian Chow Mein - Average . Eddies wok and roll in Mississauga is better Sweet and sour chicken - pedestrian Wonton Soup - pedestrian   PRO TIP: This place does NOT take MASTERCARD. Thank god I had cash on me otherwise I'd be screwed  Will NOT be back"}
{"text":"The chicken pakora was excellent. Probably some of the best I've had yet. We also had hot and sour soup which was bland. Beef and broccoli was also bland. Manchurian chicken noodles was very good."}
{"text":"Not everything is great (don't get the shrimp in lobster sauce here. Pretty bland) but I'm a big fan of their Hakka chowmein and spicy cabbage salad (complimentary side). Tip- they will give you a container full for $1"}
{"text":"Great Hakka take out, this place even has a dedicated take out door like a Swiss Chalet.   They have an extensive menu and do a good job with large, hearty portions of Hakka everything. Noodles, soup, meat, sauces, rice etc.   Their lunch specials are the reason to go, because for under $10 you'll be full and haply with your decision. For dinner take out, still good value. They give you a 10% cash discount so even better value."}
{"text":"So we came here for a late lunch / early dinner - just me and my husband for my birthday. We haven't had good Hakka food since our daughter was born 7 years ago . Lately our restaurant experiences have been disappointing - so to be honest we didn't expect much from a place in a Markham strip mall! We were wrong! This place was great - food wise. Service is spotty or it would have gotten a 4 star rating. I had a curry noodle dish and he had Manchurian chicken. Both were excellent choices! Everything was hot, seasoned well and was a treat for us to enjoy without a child asking us when we were leaving. We like it so much we almost went back the next day! We will def return and even bring our daughter! My husband is sure she will love the sparkly sinks in the bathroom!"}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss but more hits than miss. Hakka fried noodle is good, so are the white meat chili chicken. The chicken and shrimp pakoras are good but a few times they were a bit too salty. Overall a good place to go eat. It's fairly clean especially for an Asian establishment. Lots of people getting take out. Also if you pay cash for take out, they give you a 10% discount."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and it was pouring outside. The tables were all filled except for one, but when we entered, 0 out of the 7+ waiters in the restaurant acknowledged us. We stood there waiting for about 10 minutes (still nobody looking at us) before I flagged down a waiter walking by and asked if we could be seated. He looked around and told us no tables were available. I asked if the empty table in the back could seat us and he said it was reserved and walked away. We then waited another 10 minutes, watching the 7 waiters in this 15-20 seat restaurant mill about with nothing in their hands, before someone noticed us and told us a table was leaving and they'd clear it up for us in 5 minutes. At this point, my party of 4 were clearly unhappy with the lack of service. We watched the table leave and it was another 5 minutes before someone cleared their table (even though there were 7+ waiters walking about!)   Honestly, the food was unremarkable. Nothing was actually spicy. We ordered the Hot and Sour Soup which was no different from a regular buffet like Mandarin, chili chicken (average, really), manchurian fish (frozen fillets), garlic shrimp (for some reason, bright red but not even spicy), general tao beef (my friend thought it was chicken, completely covered in batter and did not resemble beef). The highlight was honestly the fried banana and icecream that came with our set dinner.   Waiters coming around to take our order were kurt and borderline impolite. The staff that brought the food over slid the plate across the table and mumbled something and left. We really had no idea what they brought over until we ate the first bite (hence mistaking their general tao beef for chicken). Seriously. For a restaurant with 7+ waiters, we expected much better service. Why hire all these people if they're not here to serve?"}
{"text":"Simply the best. Simon and his team have become the de facto standard when it comes to Hakka Chinese in the GTA. It is spicy so expect heat. Renovations make the place that much better. There is a lineup for takeout. Try the Manchurian Fried rice. so good."}
{"text":"I had Hakka, i.e. Indian Chinese, food in Mississauga before.  The food was greasy, spicy and overall bold in flavours indiscriminately.  It was a bloating experience for me.  :-(  Federick is different.  It has exceeded my expectation (yes!).  Thank Abbas for his recommendation.  We ordered Chicken Pakaro as appetizer and a Combo For Three that came with Hot and Sour Soup, Chili Chicken, Manchurian Beef, Green Beans Stirred Fried and Deep Fried Banana/Pineapple with Vanilla Ice Cream.  We were skeptical about the spice level, but our worries were unwarranted.    The Chicken Pakaro was oh so good.  It had a distinct Indian spice flavour.  The outside was crispy, but the inside was moist.  One Yelper commented that the chef had to have put some grease inside the skin prior to rolling the meat in dough.  Therefore, the grease kept the meat moist and tender.  The Hot and Sour Soup was, well hot and sour.  Very bold in flavour.  Great meal opener.  The Chili Chicken should be renamed to Sweet Chili Chicken, because the chicken was so sweet as if it was sugar glazed.  The meat was tender and marinated with chili and salt.  The spice level was mild.  The Manchurian Beef was of medium level of spiciness and the most spicy of what we ordered.  The pain and suffering was all in the sauce.  So fainted hearts, you can enjoy this dish by skipping the sauce.  Having said that, the sauce was the essence of this dish.  The beef slices were exceptionally tender and well marinated.  I didn't find it too salty, but it could be because the spice had numbed my taste buds.  The Green Beans was the crowd pleaser.  We loved it.  It was salty and borderline overboard but just not.  It was not spicy to me.  The finale, Deep Fried Banana/Pineapple with Vanilla Ice Cream (we ordered both), cooled things back to normal.  It felt good to eat something sweet and cold after the salty and hot bath that our taste buds just had had.  In all, the Hakka food at Federick Markham tastes like Chinese food to me, with the spice level tuned up by 50%.  Every dish tastes bolder, more saucy.  Unlike the unfortunate previous experience that I have had, the chefs don't over do the flavors or do it indiscriminately.  The meat is tender and fresh.  The food doesn't seem greasy.  The services was adequate.  The interior decoration is good.    Federick Markham does Indian Chinese food justice.  If I go for Hakka food again, Federick will be my first choice.  Overall, 4 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of Chinese or Hakka food, but my husband insisted we try this place. I was very impressed. The food was great. I can't really say much about the restaurant itself, as we got take out, but potions, taste of food, prices and wait time were all great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Enormous portions of quite good Hakka (Indio-Chinese, not actual Hakka) food.  Fairly large menu including many ordinary Chinese standards in Hakka style.    Generally we found the food to be quite tasty, though the ginger beef seemed to lack something in the sauce that I could not quite put a handle on.   Chicken pakoras and chili chicken were especially good.  The kulfi we ordered for dessert was simply store-bought and served in a paper container and was mediocre.  Atmopshere is modern and bright, with resonably pleasant decorative touches.  Servers have some problems with English and can be a bit surly when frustrated with the language."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  I always get the chicken Pakora ,  chilli chicken, chilli fish, general Tao beef and beef sezhuan fried rice. They never disappoint.  I always recommend this place for hakka food."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant to go to when I am craving for Hakka food. For those of you who are unaware, it is a restaurant that caters Chinese-Indian food. This place is modern with decent space as it also provides takeout options. It is a very busy restaurant, especially during dinner time, so expect lineups if you want to dine in. There is a wide selection of dishes to try in the menu and I haven't been disappointed with anything I've ordered so far. The food is generally very tasty with a lot of flavour! I would highly recommend ordering chicken pakora. It is deep fried battered chicken with a little amount of spice. It is a very popular item on the menu and you can't go wrong in ordering it! Another favourite dish of mine that I always get is \"Fung me mein.\"  It is a sweet noodle dish that all Hakka people love to eat lol To me, this is one of the many Hakka dishes to try if you want some authenticity! Despite the lineups, it is worth a try for those of you who have yet to eat here."}
{"text":"The most awful flavored and bland hakka chinese I have had in my entire life. Even the mall foodcourt chinese food is better. When we order hakka chinese food, it is finished in one sitting. The food we got we had 2/3 leftover and they were thrown out.   What we ordered  Schezwan Fried Rice - They put paprika powder in the fried rice lmao!! I am used to eating schezwan cuisine and the sauce is so wonderfully flavored. These people iust threw in powder in their fried rice.   Manchurian Chow Mein - Bland AF! Who the hell puts bok choy in a fried Chow Mein. It turned it even more bland. All it was just orange color, boiled shrimp, wilted bok choy and no flavor.   Manchurian Chicken - Filled with cornstarch and overwhelming amount of coriander stems which made it so damn bitter.   Fried Dumpling - flavorless meat  Hot n Sour soup - manageable but I have had better elsewhere.   I am never going back here. They do not know how to make hakka chinese food. Everything is a bastardization of original hakka and it doesnt even taste good. We had to throw out our food. Waste of money."}
{"text":"My family and I went for lunch. No reservation needed. The parking lot was busy but we were able to find a spot. We waited a minute or so before being seated. Service was pretty sub par - they always seemed like they were in a rush and didn't really have any time to attend to you or answer questions. After we were seated we probably waited a good 10 minutes before anyone took our orders. Food came out sporadically. I personally got my entree after most of my party had already got their food. It wasn't very fun waiting while everyone else had their food and was eating. Besides that food was pretty good - we got the fish pakora and hot and sour soup for apps - delicious - entrees ordered were chili beef, garlic fish, chicken fried rice and general Tao chicken. Food was great we enjoyed our meal and had plenty left over to take home. I would suggest going here just for take out, it really wasn't the best dine in experience but the food was delicious"}
{"text":"Came in today (March 18, 2016) for dinner with a reservation (a must!).  Ordered:  Pakora chicken; Chicken wings; Manchurian chicken; NOT good. Shrimp fried rice; Beef rice noodles; Wine fish dish;  NOT good. Fried squid; Tofu with vegetables; Curry vegetables.  Everything else was good.  For Manchurian chicken, Yueh Tung's serves the best Hakka version.  Prices are reasonable.   Servings are worthwhile.   Softdrinks are at $1.25 ($2 in most restaurants). Washrooms are clean. Take-out orders are busy too!"}
{"text":"Quality has gone down recently. Used to go here all the time! The Chilli Chicken, however, seems to always be consistent. If you order takeout, be sure not to leave your food out too long as it always seems to spoil pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Reliable Hakka  We call ahead to take out the curry fish on rice and the not-on-the-menu Fung Mee Mien which is authentic Hakka thick noodles with chicken. Can dine in but the line up is long."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go eat! Food is amazing! Chilli chicken and chicken pakora are a must!!! Usually busy, but worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"We get the boneless chilli chicken and chicken pakora every time without fail. You really get your money's worth. Our go to dinner when we're not sure what to eat or just feel like good cheap food. It's on the menu for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this place a couple of times and it's been a hit and miss but more hits than misses.  The one time we went, the chef must have been different because things lacked flavour, were soggy, and weren't aromatic enough.   All the other times we've gone, it's been fantastic.  Our favourites include:  - Hakka fried rice - the veggie version and the chicken version are both great - the veggie version is packed with a variety of veggies so it's really worth it! - Pakora chicken - an all time favourite, it seems, amongst many.  Try adding a bit of jalapeno sauce on it (they are on the tables available for you to add yourself).  - Chili chicken - yes!  So yummy - you can taste the black bean sauce and spiciness at the same time.   Overall, it seems to be a busy restaurant all the time.  I think it's because their dishes are quite large/family sized for a very reasonable price, and most importantly yummy.  Definitely worth a visit here!"}
{"text":"I went in today for lunch special there is one employee he needs training on how to treat customers I wanted to sit somewhere else if he can accommodate me he said no. He needs practice or training in how to talk to customers or maybe get fired I will not come back because of that individual"}
{"text":"Went here based on the reviews on Yelp and was absolutely delighted.  Good food, great prices, and good service.  Can't ask for more!!  Pros:  Food is delish! Prices are great! Free rice with all orders  Cons: Umm, it's far??  (Couldn't really find one :P)  Coming in on a Saturday night, it was very busy.  The restaurant itself is not busy but it's a good turnover rate so we were seated very promptly. Glazing over the menu they have a lot to choose from.  We ordered the Chili Chicken (Thanks everyone on yelp), Manchurian Beef and Green beans.  I then ordered two bowls of rice out of habit and the waitress told me we will get rice for free with our order.  Yay!  Getting dinged for 2 bucks for a bowl of rice is never fun so when it's free that's always a plus!!  The dishes came out hot and fast!!  The Manchurian beef was pretty good.  It resembled a taste I have had in the pat but can't put my finger on it at the moment.  I loved the Chili Chicken.  It was just right amount crispiness on the outside. The Green beans were very good as well.  Portion sizes were great for the price.  Usually for something like we ordered at most Chinese restaurants you're expecting a bill of about 40 bucks, sometimes before tips.  I was pleasantly happy to know that our bill with tax and tip came out to about $30.  Yay again!!    Fredericks is as good as it gets.  Great value for great food!!  Loved it.  My first 5 star review for a restaurant if I'm not mistaken!!"}
{"text":"Frederick's is one of those classic Hakka Restaurants, I honestly don't know any Hakka lovers who haven't heard of them   This location in particular is definitely one of the better Hakka Restaurants!   I often come here with my family or for quick bite with friends. It great for either takeout or dine in. However, on weekends, there's a bit of a wait for dine in, even if you made a reservation before hand.   I some of my usual go-to dishes are:   Chicken Pakoras  - some of the best ones out there, Super crispy, and always flavourful.   Veggie Hakka Noodles - SO GOOD, especially if you dine in, The noodles are always thick and cooked so well. Never soggy or limp.   Chili Chicken with Gravy  - a staple! it has a lot of green chillies   Manchurian Chicken with Gravy - Tossed in a Red Manchurian Sauce, it has a great taste and its not too spicy!  Chilli Paneer: It's honestly a great alternative if you're a vegetarian.  Veggie Fried Rice - it's honestly just as good as the Chicken Fried Rice, (they just substitute the chicken with Broccoli ) so if you have vegetarian with you, definitely get this to share!  Chicken Corn Soup - A Hakka Staple! It's a pretty mild soup with exactly as its described; chicken and corn.  Hot and Sour Soup - absolutely delicious!   The portions are always generous, and the price point is pretty great.  They also have some really great Lunch Specials."}
{"text":"Before this restaurant, my only other experience with this type of cuisine is at Lin Garden Restaurant and I loved the food there so Federick had a lot to live up to. Unfortunately, Federick did not live up to my expectations.  I came here for lunch with my parents and we got the lunch specials. It was a decent price for the portion we got. The reason Federick is inferior to Lin Garden is because their curry does not have that great curry smell nor does it have much taste. My favorite type of curry is the kind that smells great and isn't spicy (because I can't take spicy). I think it's unacceptable for curry to not have that great curry smell AND not have a taste.  Other than that, I'll come by here for lunch or dinner if I want a cheap eat ... I'll just avoid the curry on their menu."}
{"text":"great food well price, a good place for hakka place"}
{"text":"Have been going to fredericks for 20 years. The food is still ok. But service progressively going downhill. Had a terrible experience last night at Markham location. Waited almost an hour to get hour food. Everything there was Chaos.The waiters were very rude. when we asked why food Is being served to people who came after us and not us. It left us with a bitter experience. They just lost a long time customer."}
{"text":"We ordered the Szechuan shrimp, lemon flavour chicken, Manchurian rice & noodles. Each item was too bland for my liking. Service was as good as the food...not welcoming or accommodating. I'm sure there's other Hakka places around that have a higher value for their customers. Oh and the plum sauce is all on your own labour (un-package it yourself)"}
{"text":"Okay, before we start, let's get this straight and clear...Hakka food in the GTA is not really Hakka food.  The Hakka food that they serve in Hakka restaurants is actually a fusion of Indian and Hakka food.. Chinese Hakka that immigrated to India and developed a fusion of Hakka and Indian flavours that was see today.    Chicken Pakoras, Manchurian Beef and Chili Chicken???  Real Hakka food?  Nope, not real Chinese Hakka, but Indian Hakka.  Real Hakka dishes are things like Stuffed Hakka Tofu, Braised Pork Belly with Dried Hakka Mustard Greens...stuff most people would never see unless you go to someone's house.  How do I know all this stuff?  Cause I'm Hakka from India so I got some inside knowledge of this stuff baby!    Federick is an offshoot by one of the original owners of Federick in Scarborough.  This place is jammed so if you plan to eat in do make reservations especially dinner time during weekends or you'll be waiting a while.  Food is generally consistent but we've have some days where it was off as if the the main chef was not in that day.  Some favourites include Chili Chicken (both dry and wet style), Chicken and Shrimp Pakora and Hakka Noodles.  The chili in vinegar condiment is done actually pretty well so slather that thing on if you are chili head like me:)  Because they are often packed, service is without a smile with the workers unlike the ones in Mickey D's.  They do have a separate line and entrance for those who want take out so that helps relieve the long line ups that can occur during dinner rush.  Overall it's a solid Indian Hakka restaurant... Yes people, say it with me, it's \"Indian Hakka\" okay???"}
{"text":"My podiatrist is around the corner so anytime I make an appointment I take out from Fredericks. It's always busy with Asian S Asian customers which to me is a good sign. Waiters are driven and busy but in my opinion OK. My husband and I love their food, but we are not Hakka so we cannot be the best judge. Sinfully delicious food is great from time to time."}
{"text":"Food is good when they get it right.  Try the fish pakora, chicken pakora, beef fried noodles, chicken fried rice,  Good size portion.  Downside - Sometimes they overcook the pakora, the phone is always busy, sometimes no answer, or have to phone 2-5 times to get through. Websites been under construction for awhile, i have to go to other sites to see menu."}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend and we noticed that the Chicken pakoras are beyond salty and loaded with batter! More batter than chicken.  Chilli chicken is made with leg meat including leg tendons! Asked for dry and got moist, mushy, chewy, tendony bits. Ugh. Stay away from this place when craving chilli chicken!   Mushroom fried rice was bland and tasteless! Seems that no salt was added in the fried rice, ironically.   Disappointing meal. Will not return. Go to other Hakka places nearby instead."}
{"text":"I went during lunch hour and they had lunch specials for 6.85 which included a soda pop or Chinese Tea. I found the food really tasty and what we call as \"Indo-Chinese\". Portions for the price is really nice as well. It is a decently crowded place where at times, one may have to wait for a table which implies that this is a popular place for lunch. The drawback is that I did not find the staff and service up to standards I would expect. I would have ideally rated this at 3.5 but Yelp does not have that option, so giving it a 4 primarily because of the quality, taste of the food at a good price. I would definitely recommend people to try this out if you want to taste \"Indo-Chinese\"."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hakka restaurants in the GTA. They have great food and there is always a line out the door. The chili chicken and pakoras are the best. Prices are great too."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, but the reason for 4 stars is because when you ask for no MSG in your food they can't do it as its already blended into everything.  When I was here yesterday, I had all vegetarian food and the Chilli vegetables (Pakora style) was soooo good!  Service and cleanliness is also quite good.   Overall, Fredericks is much better than Tangerine across the street!"}
{"text":"Not great quality beef, terrible service, and when we asked for recommendations we were told chili beef and Manchurian noodles. We ordered both since we definitely order chili beef at most of our Hakka spots, but we were not impressed. Flavor is just OKAY."}
{"text":"The food is always better eating in compared to taking out. I feel like the quality has deceased over the years but it's still a good go-to place for a meal.   Be prepared to wait a long time for a table during busy hours (Friday nights and weekends especially). The wait for takeout can sometimes be long during these hours and definitely during holidays. I normally wait 20 or so mins but once I had to wait 40 mins. It's always best to call in and pick up.   I've had a variety of chicken and vegetarian dishes here and I've never really had one that I didn't like. There are options to remove MSG from some dishes, but not all.   My fave dish here is the chilly paneer. I love paneer and having it served in a delicious spicy sauce on a sizzling skillet makes it that much better. This dish is one that's definitely better eating in than taking out!   Prices are pretty average for this kind of cuisine but I'd still say it's a good deal. The portion sizes are big for what you pay so it's well worth it.   They have great lunch specials which are under $10 unless they've raised those prices recently. Either way, it's a great way to try a slightly smaller portion of something for cheaper before ordering a regular sized portion.   I haven't been to the original Scarborough location in a very very long time so I can't compare to that anymore.   10% off on cash orders for takeout or pickup. They don't take cards under a certain amount either.   Overall, I've been here many times and will continue to come back. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Quintessentially Hakka - this is by far the best in the GTA.   That being said, this is greasy delicious in all it's glory. You definitely should get the chicken pakoras."}
{"text":"This place is definately a gem ! the service is good the food is amazing the prices are reasonable, we ordered chicken pakora and specified white meat and it was the best appetizers i have ever had in my life ! And also the best pakoras very crunchy and not oily, being a cold day we had sweet n sour veggy soup ! As a main meal we ordered to share the following : chili chicken, beef szechuan, veggy fried rice, hakkah noodles and a plate of green beans ! Everything was just too tasty and good ! As dessert we had pistachio kulfi and deep fried banana with vanilla ice cream, it was a killer the food was fresh, the place has major line ups .. We didnt wait long but for a sunday night it was packed !"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmy food. The food was delicious and fresh. The shrimp pakoras are one of my faves. The reason I'm giving them a 4 is for great food. The customer is slow at times."}
{"text":"Good Hakka food a lot of selection. Staff was friendly and service was good. Went with family and would go back again."}
{"text":"I salute general tao beef!! Great food great prices!! Prompt service!! Rushed service they want you to finish and scram!! Staff can be quite rude and will try their best to ignore you  Good food with a side of crappy customer service!!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Frederick's  restaurant. When the Markham location opened I wasn't too sure if the quality of the food would be up to par, however I found that the food is actually better at this location.  The must haves for me are: Chili Chicken  Singapore Noodles Shrimp Pakora's  Chicken Friend Rice.  You cannot go wrong with these.  The portions are large and you will definitely have take homes."}
{"text":"I feel this is like a non-buffet version of Mandarin. As a Chinese myself, I don't feel this is genuine Chinese food. The taste is more geared towards Westernized preference. Service was just ok."}
{"text":"Love the place.  The food is great, the place is clean and the service is good.  We have been there numerous times and will hold our staff Christmas dinner there.  Can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"Being a Scarborough resident since the 70's, Federick was the first Indian Chinese place to open in Toronto! Needless to say, this new location is far from overdue, as the other location is getting somewhat outdated and crowded.   We went to this brand new Federicks for Mother's Day, and let me tell you it was busy. My initial impression of this place was it was quite unorganized right from the beginning, nobody was around to find out how many people were in our party, when can we expect a table etc. However, granted that it was Mother's day i will let this slide.   The new location in terms of decor is very modern. The red lights remind me of a Moroccan oasis, not \" indian-chinese\" at all. But the decor was impressive, well done on that. The only TV that was on, was showing a formula one race! Not what i was expecting in these types of restaurants, where bollywood music videos are the norm. To me, that is what also makes an indian chinese restaurant \" indian!..know what I mean  On to the food...   We ordered the chicken and fish pakoras for appetizers and let me tell you I was quite impressed. Given the fact that this place was busy, the pakoras were very fresh. 5/5 on this!   We then ordered the chilli chicken ( white meat), szechuan beef, veggie Manchurian noodles, and Manchurian pakora balls ( veggie).   Chili Chicken was good 4/5..szechuan beef was horrible, like really that was not szechuan beef..its wasn't spicy at all, in fact I thought they brought the wrong dish!..1/5..Veggie Manchurian Noodle's bit salty..but okay 3/5..manchurian pakora balls..kinda sweet..not what i expected 3/5.   Overall, the food was just okay. The decor is what i remembered. I have eaten at many Indian Chinese places across the city, and for me Federicks has lost its charm. I can now say that I have tried both locations.  The GTA now contains many Indian Chinese restaurants throughout. Do yourself a favour, and try those..( Tangerine, Chopsticks, Guddi's, China Cottage) you will get better food."}
{"text":"Always consistent and always delicious. They also do catering. I recommend their chilli chicken, manchurian chicken, Singaporean fried noodles, Hakka fried noodles, spicy crispy beef and shrimp pakoras. This place has less greasy food than the other Hakka restaurants and service is amazingly fast."}
{"text":"I got take out and we ordered the Chilli Chicken, hakka noodles and the shrimp fried rice. Everything was OK, I was actually a little disappointed since people rave so hard about this place. Maybe I ordered the wrong things but tbh all the dishes lacked in flavour.  The chilli chicken was the best one out of the three, its one of those dishes you first bite into and its good and then as you eat it, you get so sick of it cause it starts to not taste like anything. I've definitely had better chilli chicken yo!  The hakka noodles tasted like OIL and noodles with pieces of chicken in it, no flavour at all.  The shrimp fried rice just lacked in flavour again, ended up eating steamed rice because it had more flavour than this dish.   I guess to even give 3 stars is being generous. Sorry to say..."}
{"text":"For those who haven't had Hakka (or as Wei C. says, should be accurately called Indian Hakka), it's like a mix of Chinese and Indian dishes combining cooking techniques and flavors such as soy, sweet, and spicy. One of my fav dishes is garlic fish which has chunks of succulent battered deep fried fish bathing in a sea of goopy bright red orange sweet sauce. Despite the name, it isn't that garlicky although I do know some Hakka places that put an F-ton of garlic in their \"garlic\" dishes, but haven't been there in awhile so reviews are pending. Practically every dish comes with rice and it's decent but a little on the dry side whereas I like mines more moist. In fact, I'm thinking rice leftovers must see Medusa overnight and magically turn into rock. This isn't isolated to just Federick but oddly any rice leftovers from any Hakka joint I've been to. Other great dishes include chili chicken and Hakka noodle. Used to like the shrimp with lobster sauce, but last few orders seemed to have less and less lobster taste. Pro tip: get the vinegar and hot sauce on the side to kick up the heat. This location has much better parking than the OG location in Scarbs as it's in a newer plaza with a huge lot. Minus one star for the perpetually grouchy and unfriendly service which is highlighted by grunts and other unknown sounds when they talk."}
{"text":"accommodated our group of 30, though they were not too keen on it. We pre ordered the food order so they were prepared when we got there. The food was what we ordered and was even modified for vegetarians. Also, price was cheaper than we calculated ourselves. And it's halal. This is what we had:  Steam Dumplings $3.50 Fried Dumplings $3.50 Chicken with Black Bean Sauce $6.95 Sliced Fish with Delicious Curry Sauce $7.50 Singapore Rice Noodle $7.00 Kan Shue Green Beans $6.50 Beef with Bamboo Shoots and Mushroom $7.75 Manchurian Bean Curd $6.50  It was all good. Go for it!"}
{"text":"I've had Federick's since I was in elementary school, so that in itself is amazing. I didn't have it as often early on, but when they opened a new location up in Markham, I was sold (and so were my parents). I'd often see food from Federick's at least one or twice a week - sometimes even more on a special occasion.  I'm not very fond of the service, both in person and on the phone (otherwise I'd give Federick's a 5 star review), but honestly the food and the nostalgia of it is more than enough for me to come back.  Love spice? I recommend getting the Chili Chicken: stir-fried chicken with onions, smothered with a spicy gravy-like sauce. The spice kicks in after the first bite and gradually builds the more you eat it.  Want spice, but fried? Try the Chicken Pakoras: fried balls of chicken mixed with green chilis. They're absolutely superb with a squeeze of lemon.  Not feeling the heat? Try the Beef Fried Rice, Crispy Shrimp, or Crispy Chicken Wings. For a Hakka Chinese place, they actually do chicken wings pretty well.  Not everything is a hit at Federick's, but the ones that are good are REAL good."}
{"text":"This is not my first time coming to this restaurant but I must say that the quality and consistency of the food and service is slipping.  I was immmediately asked how many people I was going to be dining with as i walked in and was seated accordingly. My friend and I were deciding on what to order and had gotten carried away into a conversation. We were quite rudely interrupted by a server asking us if we were ready to order. The server was very to the point and did not come off as too friendly. However, this was not our first time here and we've had servers with a lot of enthusiasm!  We had an order of the dry chili chicken and the hakka squid. The food we ordered took about 15 minutes to come which was not a problem. Both the chili chicken and the hakka squid were covered in a lot of breading. However the flavour of the meat could still be tasted and was still quite delicious. The dishes also came with a bowl of white rice which was more than enough for two hungry people!  The ambiance and decor of the restaurant was quite submissive and warm and makes a good place to dine in and have good conversation.  The total price of the meal was just above $20 which is quite fair compared to other hakka restaurants.   I would definitely recommend the hakka squid if you decide to check out this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Note to management: don't let kids walk into your restaurant and try to sell chocolate to your customers."}
{"text":"Reviews are overrated. Their chicken smells bad like its rotten.. There's so many othe haka Chinese restaurants food are way better than here"}
{"text":"Def. one of my favourite Chinese restaurants! Whenever my family or friends want Chinese, we either come here to eat, or order for take-out, and were never disappointed (well, so far)!   The portions are huge, and the dishes are delicious. I have tried many items on the menu, however my favourites would be the hot and sour soup, Manchurian chicken fried rice and chilli chicken. Those three are a must have when eating here.  The service is exceptional; the staff are kind, however they do not come so often to check up on you. However, whenever you do need something, they do come to you quick, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"While I still love this place....things seem to be going downhill. Food quality is not as good as it was in the past. On my last two visits, I've ordered the same dishes and on each occasion, the only thing consistent was the name. Quality was all over the place. Service is odd. Your dishes do not come out at the same time...it comes out when the chef/cook feels like making them. On our last visit our green beans came out as we were finishing up our meals...to be honest, we thought they had forgotten about them. The time before, the noodle dish we ordered came out a good 10 minutes after the rest of our meal did. It's very odd and not a great way to serve food. Some staff are great...some shouldn't be working there. I still love their green beans (kan shue). Last time we ordered the chili chicken it was good, the time before it was dreadful.....lots of fatty pieces in it. Its still my go to place for Hakka.....I live in Woodbridge and drive out for their food."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating Hakka food, First time at this great little restaurant hidden away in Markham..   Service: Fast and friendly - as soon as we arrived we were seated right away. Also during our meal a couple different waiters asked if we were doing \"ok\" while we were slowing down our eating to chat (found that very polite and showed they valued our business)  Food: We order the Chili Chicken (which came with a bowl of rice on the side) and Chicken  Pakora. I found both these dishes full of flavour. The key with the chicken pakora is to squeeze the lemon over it, i first tried the appetizer without the lemon and then with the lemon and i have to say the lemon is a MUST HAVE when enjoying this dish, changes the flavour all together. I also liked how the rice came on the side and not mixed in with the chili chicken. I found the rice to be a little hard and a tad bit under cooked so by having it on the side helped me decided on how much i wanted to add to my plate with my meal.  Environment: Clean, new, and very modern. It was not a huge restaurant so i can see this place filling up fast during prime time dinner time and possibly have line up's out the door. We sat down for dinner around 9:30 pm so the restaurant was just finishing up. I never felt as if they were kicking us out or rushing us in anyway.  All in all i would definitively return over and over again when in the mood to add some spice to my life"}
{"text":"Delicious greasy spicy Hakka food. Chilli chicken is great! Machurian chicken fried rice, and pankora are also my fav. Lunch specials are so cheap, $5.75 with a drinks, huge portion.  You get 10% off for take out with cash."}
{"text":"First time to eat here after shopping at Costco. Very disappointed on our order of sliced fish with curry sauce. Battered fish deep fried poured with curry sauce and raw green peppers. It was very salty. Brought it to the server's attention but said it was too late now. Wasted half a plate. Can't eat it. Also, picked the fried rice with shrimps from the photo since it looked so good on the menu. Well, totally different dish. Another disappointment!  Deep fried crispy beef and chicken pakora were good. Not going back here again."}
{"text":"Ive become almost a regular at this place.   its very consistent and your almost guaranteed lunch for the next day.    not much more to say about it... large portions, great value.  dry chilli chicken is a must."}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone is raving about the chilli chicken here, ive had it about three times and frankly it lacks flavor ive had way better chilli chicken at other hakka restaurants. Their service needs some work, had to ask waiter about 3 times for water and took over half an hour to bring it."}
{"text":"Well, where should I start. The food is great, let's get that out of the way. The service though? Oh lawd. Absolutely terrible at times. Waiters standing around doing nothing while a busy restaurant tries to get their attention. Needing to ask 4 different waiters to check on out order (may as well assemble a team for a one-person job, right?). Helplessly trying to get the attention of a waiter while she sits down and begins socializing with customers.   The list goes on. Basically, if you can deal with the molasses-speed and pre-pubescent attitude of the waiters, then it's worth the trip. Or you know, just get takeout."}
{"text":"Best take out..best Hakka...way better than tangerine.  Love their chili chicken & Hakka chow.  Called for take out after work, picked up, went home & great dinner."}
{"text":"I am familiar with the Scarborough location however I completely forgot how great their food is!!! If you love spicy food, this is your spot!! We ordered the chicken pakora, beef and broccoli, thai rice noodles and spicy squid and a small side of rice but large enough to feed 4 ppl... All delicious and all for $40.00!!! Amazingggg value for suuuure!!! Will return often since I live like 2mins away. Lol!!!"}
{"text":"Sooo Happy Frederick FINALLY opened a new location! If anyone knows the Ghetto Hole in the wall that is the Scarborough Location this is like a breath of fresh air.....my only question about this location is why they didn't make it larger...but it's still better than the original! For those of you who don't know about Fredrick's they specialize in Hakka Chinese Food which is Spicy Indian Style Chinese Food.  Our party of 5 arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday and we could see the line up of people waiting for tables. FYI they don't take reservations unless your a group of 10+. I was a bit confused as to how you alert them you need a table as there is no hostess desk but I soon learned from the line up of customers that you either flag down a waiter or go to the cashier where people are getting take out orders and they will give you a number which you wait to be called.  Also the numbers they give you don't go in order, they call out numbers based on the table availability... so if a table for 2 opened up and your a table of 5 that couple of 2 who came after you may get a table before you. I could see the frustration in customers waiting in line not comprehending why others with higher numbers who came after them got a table before them.  Anywho we waited for about 35 minutes for a table. The food comes out super fast and they do table turnovers and clean up in lightning speed.  FYI No free refills here as Pop is served in the Can. They set the table with a pitcher of water and trust me the food is sooo spicy that water is greatly appreciated. We also ordered a green tea and they fill a mug of green tea and place it on the table and brought extra cups so we could all share. There green tea here is pretty tasty too!  This was our order  Deep Fried Wontons - addictive chicken wrapped wontons, crunchy and light Deep Fried Dumplings - pork stuffed plump and delicious Chicken Pakora - spicy battered chunks of chicken dotted with green chilies *must try General Tao Chicken - chunks of chicken in a sweet sauce with red&green chilies Chili Chicken Extra Spicy - battered&sauced chunks of chickens studded with green chilies and sauteed onions *there specialty ***spicy Manchurian Mixed Chow Mein - spicy flat noodles with chicken & shrimps Chicken Fried Rice White Rice  Plus a green tea and 3 cans of pop the bill totaled less than 60 bucks!  We could not believe the amount of food we got! The portion sizes are enormous, you just need one order of each item so order lots of different items to share and try! We packed all the left overs to go which will be more than enough for dinner the next day! Despite the business and chaos of the restaurant the service is outstanding, we never felt rushed and waiters are always checking on you! Food comes out piping hot, fast, with hefty portions and all fresh ingredients and they don't skimp on those chilies either so beware if you ask for your meal Extra Spicy!"}
