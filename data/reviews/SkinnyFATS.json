{"text":"So happy there is finally a SkinnyFats closer to home. And this one seems like much more space. My go to is the Slow boat to China. Mr Green is a good drink as well. Customer service was good."}
{"text":"Hello, today I visited SkinnyFATS for the first time.  I rated it 3 stars, parts of my visit were impressive, others were not.  Allow me to divulge.  The menu and food selection are great.  Wide variety of offerings, prices in-line with what you get.  I was impressed and excited to get on with my meal.  I ordered from the Things in Bowls section of the menu, and opted for the Smoke in a Bowl.  The meal was good, I would have it again, filled me up, plenty of chicken, plenty of vegetables, nice flavor.  It was good, nothing to write home about, but good.  One thing I noticed, not sure exactly what black bean salsa is at SkinnyFATS, but I didn't see a single black bean in my bowl.  It was very dark where I was sitting in the restaurant so maybe I just couldn't see it.  The customer service left a lot to be desired.  It's all about training your employees, some owners/ managers take it seriously, others don't.  The person that took my order was great, friendly, helpful, nice smile.  I should mention I was asked to provide ID as I was using my debit card.  I assume SkinnyFATS has been burned repeatedly by their customers using debit/ credit cards that don't belong to them, hence they card you, doesn't say much about their clientele overall.  Also, I ordered a Coke, I was truly surprised when I got to the soft drink fountain and Coke wasn't an option.  Seems that should have been mentioned to me.  The person that brought me my food, didn't say a word to me, not one.  I offered a Hello and a Thank You as my food was delivered... my words were completely ignored.  Very common courtesy dictates, especially in a retail/ business type of establishment that when offered a Hello or a Thank You by a customer, a simple reply is good business.  I assumed the person that delivered my food was having a bad day at work.  As I was enjoying my Smoke in a Bowl one of the staff was busy clearing and cleaning the table next to me.  As this person started to vigorously sweep the floor beneath and around the table next to me, I lost my appetite.  Sweeping the floor stirs up dust and whatever else is on the floor.  In my head I was imagining all sorts of debris floating around in the air and landing on my table and on top of my Smoke in a Bowl and in my off-brand Coke.  I was disgusted and soon stopped eating.  SkinnyFATS and another restaurant I consider to be very similar in concept, Greens and Proteins, are welcome additions to the Las Vegas restaurant scene in my opinion.  Next time I'll probably head to G&P where I always get top notch food AND service."}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Come last night right when they were closing (accidentally). We were standing outside the door because we thought we were too late.  The cashier saw us and waived us in with a big smile.   The cashier was beyond knowledgeable and helpful with the menu.  We received out food very quickly and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection.  The Cherry Popper Burger was outstanding and the truffle fries are addicting.   One of the very best burgers in town. All the staff were friendly and happy and we never felt rushed, even though we were the last ones there.  This was my third time there and the food just keeps getting better and better.  I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The food is ok but not worth the terrible service .i waited 45 minutes for a juice and lady comes out and says sorry I was on phone ."}
{"text":"food ordered: BLT sandwich w/ fries & liquid defense juice  food: BLT sandwich was nicely made, good portion of bacon in the sandwich.  Liquid defense juice tasted good.   misc: location is a tad bit small... seating for more than 4 people might be a little difficult.  come early and seating wouldn't be too bad, but come later and it's a tight squeeze in the room. restaurant is located off the strip in an industrial strip mall looking area facing the fwy."}
{"text":"Not much I can say that has already been said about this place. Food is simply amazing, I recommend checking out there Instagram or pics here if you need some help picking out what you want to get. Secret menu galore"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I tried this place after thinking it looked something like Greens & Proteins.  We were wrong!  The menu is pleasing and sounds good, but that's where the illusion ends.  After getting our food, a steakcation and the meltdown with a side of truffle fries, we anxiously waited for our food.  When it arrived, my burger was super greasy and the meat and cheese were absolutely bland.  My girlfriend's salad was equally dull.  The meat lacked any flavor and the dressing failed to redeem the enjoyment of the meal.  The truffle fries were ok, but nothing memorable.  All in all, the food sated our hunger pains, but left us feeling completely unsatisfied.  A few hours later, I felt sick to my stomach.  I don't understand all the rave reviews, but it didn't sit well for us.  We won't return."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and I just want to say I love the food! The service is always fantastic. I'm a picky eater with specific orders. I always come around the same time and I usually see the  same cooks back there. There is one in particular, I don't know his name but he wears a hat and has tattoos but he always makes my food perfect and has the best attitude with a smile always on his face. Keep up the good work skinny fats!"}
{"text":"Great service with a genuine smile. Everyone was eager to help in any way possible. Beyond their 5-star service the food is exceptional! A healthy side with a happy side is gnarly! Great tasting food at amazing prices. Too bad I am not a local, but I will definite stop when in town. Try the Hot Latina soup, it's . LOVE IT."}
{"text":"Was hoping for something better but the burger was bland and the fruit was a couple days old.  Had someone walk up to me right after my first bite of the egg burger and ask if I could move. Maybe if I wasn't starving from waiting so long I wouldn't have given him a dirty look with a big fat NO.  GOOD ENOUGH WHEN STARVED"}
{"text":"Had a special pineapple protein pancakes. They were amazing. Those pancakes should be on their regular menu. Also I'm not a fan of turkey bacon but theirs was equally tasty. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I visited SkinnyFats for the first time on May 24.  I have been wanting to try this place for a while after seeing many pics of the incredible food on Facebook.  I was not disappointed!  My friends planned a post surprise birthday celebration there for me.  The entire staff was awesome & very accommodating & the food definitely lived up to the pics.  We all ordered something different so we could try the many different menu items.  Everything was absolutely delicious!!!!  I will definitely be returning & highly recommending this place to everyone.  Loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"Was the worst breakfast ever. Ordered eggs bacon potatoes and toast and bottle water and was $17 and food was cold and terrible. Bread was stable. Everything cold no taste.  Don't waste your time. Menu really fools you makes thinks sound delicious but there not"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. It had everything I was looking for... Good coffee, high quality healthy breakfast options, and fresh juice. All available in the evening.   Staff was attentive and food came out fast. 5/5"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! I usually have their food truck where there is a limited menu , but I entered a drawing at one of the local LV events and won a $20 gift certificate. My brother was in town, so I decided to take him to this place. We went on a Wed afternoon and it was PACKED! I was surprised at the size of the place. It is really small, but the portions, prices, and service make up for the long wait. I also found out they have online ordering, which is always great.   The food was fantastic. I had the veggie sandwich, my brother had a typical breakfast, and my sister in law had the burger. Portions were massive, and for 34 bucks(before the gift card) is not bad.  I also love the concept of this place. It has two sides of the menu; a HAPPY and HEALTHY. One side is healthy food, and the other is...not...so healthy.   Highly recommend this place if you are looking for well made food that is unique to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I have been here so many times and I have NEVER had a bad experience. There is always something new to try (that you probably have never had) and if you have had it all they are always coming out with new specials.   The customer service here is also fantastic. The atmosphere is really mellow. Mostly EDM music, but not so loud that you can't talk to a friend or date.   Inside they offer both table seating and a type of bar seating around a large high table. They also have one giant screen TV and one projected TV, typically showing sports. They offer outside seating as well under nice string garden lighting.   I would recommend this place to anyone. They do have another location which I have been to. however, the atmosphere does not compare. This location is highly recommended for your first time!"}
{"text":"I've been to the southwest Vegas location. I love this place. The decor, the food, the cost, the variety, the creativity...all of it is satisfying. There are so many items on the menu I want to try I will definitely have to return! We sat outside on their lovely patio, very enjoyable. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"BRILLIANT idea to have a health versus not-so-healthy-but-makes-one-happy menu! Definitely my favorite spot since moving to Vegas recently! So many fantastic restaurants here but this place has recieved my business more times than not! Plus I love drooling over their Instagram food porn"}
{"text":"The food is inarguably good.  But $45 before tip for two sandwiches and two drinks is crazy steep for an establishment of this caliber.  The sandwiches are stacked for height, not even distribution.  The cookies are raw in the middle.  Theres sugar in the bread they use.  And theres little things here and there which I would think they should do better, but its alright.  They try to say they are a healthier option and in some aspects that might be true, but not terribly so. Also, the truffle fries were nothing compared to those you find at Bachi Burger.  Service is good and I was very impressed with them today.  I tipped extra because of the extra attention they gave to the newbie in my group.  The establishment is nice and clean which is of utmost importance to me. I would come back. It's a nice stop for a quick brunch with your sweetheart."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! They were a little slow when they first opened but they have picked up their pace. Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times. Shrimp tacos, caramel cookie, wraps,  everything is amazing. Service amazing and always new food items. The spot to try when in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get something different . The food quality is always good and their fat/happy items are all amazing . I was recently disappointed to find most of my favorite skinny/ healthy items are no longer on their menu . I loved the idea of treating myself to some healthier options after losing a few lbs and ended up going to another restaurant because there just wasn't anything left that I was looking forward to eating . If your looking for good food they still have plenty of options. I just hope they add back some of there salads and healthier breakfast options that are more vegetarian friendly and I might be back."}
{"text":"Delivery took an hour and I was 2 miles alway we ordered the most basics acai bowl and ahi poke and smoothies. I have worked in the industry before its a taco and granola bowl should of been 20 min tops. Should of gotten a discount. :/ dissapointed."}
{"text":"Insane food for the healthy and the not so. Great choices for the wife and better choices for me :)"}
{"text":"I enjoy this location a little more than the other one more seating and outside seating as well. Food is always excellent. Love the cookies and they offer to warm them up for you. Service is really good considering it's not a full blown restaurant but all the employees treat you awesome. What I really like is all the employees get along like best friends it brings the vibe up and everyone is happy to work here."}
{"text":"Best portobello burger I've ever had. My husband thought his classic burger was fantastic, too. Great place. Would definitely go again. All be menu items looked really tasty."}
{"text":"My husband and I liked this place so much during vacation, we came back a second time before we left. I had the pineapple jack pancakes that were huge and filled with pineapple both inside and on top. Ver good! The other time I had a breakfast sandwich with egg, applewood bacon, avocado and a salmon/cream cheese spread. It had a side of potatoes with peppers cooked with it. My husband enjoyed truffle fries and black coffee. We both agreed that if we had one in our town we would be there all the time! The complimentary water is also flavored with cucumber if I remember correctly. So refreshing! Also, great staff! Being new to the establishment, the young woman behind the counter was very patient in talking us through the menu."}
{"text":"I give this place two stars because the food is great. I go here when I travel to Las Vegas and every time I do they either screw up my order or don't cook all of it. The wait time is ridiculous.   But again, the food is really good."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  It is really a hidden gem.  Food was awesome.  Good size portions and a good variety.  The sodas were awesome.  Even the ketchup was awesome.  So what I'm saying is this place is awesome."}
{"text":"The food is incredible.  The fresh flavors and quality are excellent.  The prices are good for the quality of the food. The Ahi Tacos were wonderful.  The cherry popper burger was great. The seating left a lot to be desired. The service was great.  The restaurant is way to small.  We were told by our waitress that the busy hours are between 11-2. The rest of the time seating is easy. We will definitely return, but not between 11 and 2. I would give a 5 star rating except for the seating. There are only 4 tables that seat 4 and four tables that seat 2. There is a bar that seats around 10."}
{"text":"So good. No matter what kind of food you are in the mood for SkinnyFATS is the way to go. Some of my favorites are the Nice to Greek You and the STEAKation."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Make sure to try the jazz hands or the speed boat floats! Sprite and mango with ice cream is amazing!!! The coke with strawberries is great too!!! This place has great food and the décor is very cool. Impeccable service and always very friendly. One of the best kept secrets in Las Vegas. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Amazing concept! Fresh chicken.  Naked chix are delicious.  Flat chicken outrageous.   Can't wait to go back to try more.   Great work guys.  Great staff.  Keep smiling."}
{"text":"Just when all else seemed drab - skinnyFATS saved the day! I could tell by the look on the office's face that we were all pretty burnt out on lunch spots. So when i found this place online I was very excited. I ordered up 8 of the \"Bomb Diggity's\"  Arrived a little soggy -but that was soon made up for with their tastiness - I'll say it was a success - everyone gawked for the whole lunch hour at the variety on their menu while chowing down!! Thanks skinnyFATS!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I heard great things about it and was really wanting to try it so when they opened a new location right around the corner for me, I decided to go and give it a try.   The decor is really cool and casual...the food is great...the staff sweet and fun! Well I think I just found my new favorite little everyday place!"}
{"text":"No more acai bowl!!!!!  I made a special trip here just for it but it's not available on their menu any longer :-(   They have a cool vibe...kinda like an underground feeling but it isn't underground lol."}
{"text":"Mother. Of. God. This place is KILLER.   MUST HAVES:  Spicy Latina soup. I can handle medium spicy food (typically order level 5 at Indian/Thai places) and this soup was very spicy. It's so good though I pushed through. It's worth it - the best tortilla soup I've ever had.   Ahi Sriracha taco. Get it. Get it now.   Any of the juices/smoothies are on point!  Definitely coming here again for a healthy meal or greasy hangover food. So good!"}
{"text":"The staff weren't friendly until the owner came in to collect a bag of cash. We waited 26 minutes for a burger and grilled chicken.   While waiting, the blonde guy behind the  to-go counter bent over and half of his bare ass was shown to anyone waiting to order. He then pulled up his underwear with his bare hands and proceeded to put plates together before sending them out. Disgusting.  To top off the experience, ass-hands didn't put the lid on the container correctly and its contents spilled all over the bag. Great."}
{"text":"Good selection and service. The menu will please most appetites. It's a little pricy but you feel like you get your money's worth in taste and quality.  I think one of the most unique things are the shakes, you could literally have a spinach milkshake.  This place is worth giving a try!"}
{"text":"The lady that takes your order in the front with red hair is totally unhelpful and pretty rude ... I hate writing negative reviews but she single handily was able to totally turn off by this place from initial contact. I found this place through yelp and saw awesome looking food, when I got there most the stuff we tried to order she said they don't serve there anymore because they were specials and totally was unhelpful in breaking down the menu or explaining a menu that is a bit hard to maneuver as to what your in the mood for when they have catchy cute names like slow boat to China... I ended up ordering something I saw on yelp that they actually had and sat down with a paper menu to go over it to figure out what to order. Then realized that I rather just try to enjoy what I did order and then if still hungry will head else where."}
{"text":"Clean healthy eats. Food never fails. Quality and quantity. Plus the staff is so awesome. Friendly, funny and awesome crew."}
{"text":"First time eating here and the cashier was very helpful, super friendly & had a very positive attitude. She made me feel very welcome for my first time being here. Excellent customer service, delicious food & we didn't wait that long for our food. This place is a must try. We will definitely be back to try the other menu items."}

{"text":"They just opened this location and we're so happy they're in the southwest now!  The new location is slightly bigger too - but still has seating issues due to how busy it is :(  There is an outdoor portion but I wish it was shaded with a sheer canopy.  Our biggest advice is that their menu is really, really diverse.  There are some more typical things as well as some more adventurous dishes.  After trying a variety of different things during our repeat visits, there were things we LOVED and things we wouldn't order again.  The ahi taco is one of our repeat favorites, we've tried both the healthy side version and the happy side, and both are delicious, and prefer the healthy one since the tuna is raw & seared instead of fully cooked.  Happymess - pieces of steak, crumbled blue cheese, on a bed of fries.  Good but not great.  Smotherload - a HUGE breakfast burrito (that lives up to its name).  Good but would honestly love to have a smaller version of it on the menu too!  Chick and Waff-a-Doppolis - So simple - just chicken tenders on a waffle with syrup, but it was delicious.  One of my favorites now actually.  And lastly, not sure what the name is, but it was brown pancakes with a turkey patty in between, egg whites, and raspberry sauce - this was our least favorite and we actually didn't finish it.  Overall it was way too sour unfortunately.  Overall awesome place and once you find what you love, it's easy to get addicted.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I went here today after all the rave reviews and comments from my friends. First impressions: to start out, it's located in a business center. There is only a very little sign on the side walk with their name. With the interesting choice of location, comes with a very small, cramped and confusing restaurant. When we walked in to the door I was so confused. Along the window is a bar to sit and wait and I wasn't sure where to start. There was not a single seat in the house. We didn't even stay to look at the menu. Next time I will order ahead and take my food to go. If I ever do go back. It wasn't a very welcoming or comfortable environment at all. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"Outstanding place to eat, I highly recommend getting the steak eyes I thought I died and went to heaven. Staff is awesome."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place was recommended. First impression walking in was that it was a little rustic and a lot hipster. I'm glad it wasn't busy otherwise seating would have been tricky with a toddler in tow. The food was dynamite. I ordered the chickety China and it had a great combo of tangy and sweet. The slaw was nicely coated and crisp, even my one year old loved it. My husband had the cherry popper burger, it was delicious. The meat had a nice fresh taste and the aioli was great. The truffle fries were super tasty. We ordered off the happy side and will definitely be back to try more and the healthy side looked great too. Hopefully this location catches on, I've been to a few different restaurants at this spot. The location is great and will be recommending to many friends."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is located in an awkward, small office park on Dean Martin near Sunset with minimal parking and minimal space inside, so if you're planning on a weekday lunch be prepared for a bit of a crowd and nowhere to park. The restaurant is equally small but colorful with just a handful of two- and four-top tables, and maybe ten seats facing a high counter along the window. There are veggies and animals painted all over the walls, with fun metal corrugated ceiling tiles. It's a loud, lively space, and gets a bit hectic when it's crowded. The menu has a healthy and unhealthy side, both filled with quite a number of items for breakfast, lunch or dinner. On the healthy side you will see juices, snacks, gluten-free pizzas and sandwiches. On the unhealthy side, or happy side as they call it, you have choices of shakes, waffles, snacks, sandwiches, and more. There seems to be plenty of options for whatever you're looking for, and I'll certainly have to stop back in to try some more.  So as usual I came for one thing, and in this case it's their Cheeseburger Benedict: 1/2lb angus burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar, avocado, red onion, fried egg and SF sauce. What came out looked great, but was kind of like the Rollin' Smoke burger I ate a few weeks ago; too damn large to properly enjoy. There's something to say of the spectacle, but the oversized assembly makes for a slightly inedible burger. The moment I picked it up and gave it a squeeze I could tell the bun might be a bit dry. The patty was sticking out from the edges of the bun so I was able to sample it on its own; it was of good quality and cooked well. The bun was indeed a bit too dry, and on first bite a bit too thick as well, but the burger quickly got messy so I saw the need for something with a bit more substance. The egg had good flavor but got a bit lost in everything, there was tons of cheese that had good flavor, although some of it still wasn't melted by the time it got to my table. The lettuce was prominent and proportionally just enough, and the pickles were also good. I knew the avocado was there because a few slices fell out, but I couldn't taste it within the burger with all those other flavors mixed in. If this burger was simplified and you could properly sample some of the intended flavors it could be really great, but there is just far too much going on to enjoy this. Does any burger really need a fried egg, onion, pickles, avocado AND a sauce? I guess many people would argue that this is what a burger is all about, but for me it's a bit much. Oh and as for that sauce, I don't even know what it tasted like, and for me that's the problem.  The truffle fries on the other hand were really good; almost all of them were cooked well and they were very flavorful. I found myself eating them well after my giant burger was done. Again, I feel like I have to defend myself with my slight disappointment; a massive burger is a great thing, but when you add too many toppings they start to cancel each other out. Maybe the solution is choosing only one or two of their offered toppings, which could provide a slightly simplified and very flavorful burger. For $10.50 with fries this really isn't a bad deal, I just found it to be a few too many items piled together. Still, the menu looks great, and all the food looks to be of very good quality, so I'll surely be back to try other items soon."}
{"text":"First off the food is great, this was a solid 4 1-2 star experience.  There are a few things that would keep me from giving it a perfect 5.  I'm a local and the location is tucked away on Dean Martin, kind of hard to get to for out of town-ers if you don't know where you're going; thank goodness for GPS.  I would study the menu before coming here, because they have a lot of choices and you might miss out on something good.  I ended up going with a Cherry Popper Hamburger, fries and a drink.  That was $17.00.  Very pricey for a hamburger, fries and a drink but good!!   This particular location is very small and not good for groups of more than 4.  It's open seating and you will struggle to find seating together, especially if it's busy.  So take that into consideration.  The service was good. You order at the counter, service with a smile, get your drink and wait for your food at your table. That's pretty much it.  No frills (except for the food).  Quality but kind of pricey.   I would eat here again.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Always a breath of fresh air to go to an unassuming eatery with good food! Place has a very low key, hip vibe. Customer service is superb. Food is fantastic.  My lyft driver gave me some recommendation on food and it was spot on.  They have unique names so you have to read to know what you are getting but I loved the portobella mushroom burger and sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"My husband and I checked this restaurant out today for lunch. The atmosphere and the food were great! The staff was very friendly and attentive. We both ordered from the Fat side of the menu. Shameful, I know. He ordered the Philly sandwich and I ordered Chix on Broadway which is basically a chicken sandwich and a BLT on a bun. We were both pleased. The only downside about this restaurant is the seating. The ding area is almost as small as my restroom. Once we ordered our meals we had to stand and wait for seating. I don't know that theres a solution to this problem because the restaurant is so tiny. Perhaps they should have a drive thru window???"}
{"text":"Great place and great food but to far from the strips. Steakation was very tasty and I loved it :-)"}
{"text":"115 calories?!?! I got the Zucc It bowl. It tasted amazing and seriously it was only 115 calories? I don't believe it for how much food it was. It had a spice to it that was just right. I also got a side of truffle fries. It was actually a lot more than I expected. First time here definitely impressed me. Will definitely go back to try other things on the skinny menu."}
{"text":"The food is hit and miss. The menu is more land mind. Food is kinda bland, but a few things are redeeming. I been to two different locations. The price is too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Had the Brussel crowe salad and it was the \"gladiator\" of salads. I'm so glad I was able to find this place. And even my husband liked it. It's healthy meets happy! Definitely making this one of our regular places."}
{"text":"Meh. Overrated. Overthought recipes with odd recipe combinations. Overpriced. Good smoothies, liked the waffle. The food is either bland or way overthought."}
{"text":"Definitely enjoyed my food. Had the Benedict burger and it was super tasty. Sweet potato fries are awesome as well. Honestly the options and layout of the menu is fantastic, odd location but still delicious. I think if it was somewhere with real foot traffic they would so busy. Kinda nice to have them where they are, but i do hope to see them open more locations"}
{"text":"We used to eat here a lot and loved it. Over the top in love with this restaurant and their food but..and I hope the chef reads this in particular. We usually order the ahi taco and the tu-nuts.cucumbed boat and the Teri ahi sandwich. We love ahi but this time we aren't even sure if it was ahi. It was barely edible. Tough chewy fish. Not up to their usual standards. We will prolly give them one more chance at the Decatur location but then that's it. Customer gone. And I promote restaurants I love for free. Pls don't ruin it. Pls pay attention to the quality of your ingredients"}
{"text":"I discovered SkinnyFats when searching for Juice Bars on Yelp. Turns out Vegas has plenty of smoothie places, but not many cold-pressed juice options, especially close to the Strip. I went twice on my Vegas trip. I had both the Mr. Green w/ a Vita shot and Hangover Remedy. Both juices were refreshing and very pleasing. The restaurant was packed with people both times I went. After you order at the counter, they give you a number to take to a table. I look forward to going back and ordering some food off of the impressive Healthy Side of the menu board."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding, the only reason I didn't give five stars is that its a pain if you want to order another drink or more food to get up from the table and go wait in line again to order something. Id be willing to bet their ticket averages go up 10-20 percent if you could order from the table."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everyone is super nice, professional, and attentive. And the food is always as advertised and delicious."}
{"text":"Very small place. There is maybe six tables and bar sitting area. Be prepared to wait in a long line and then wait longer for food. Only one table for outside sitting. Horrible location. But Food is delicious. So many unique options! There is a healthy and a fatty side of the menu. Good presentations and taste is amazing. It is a little pricey though. It is worth a few trips but not a place I'd go often. And they close at 9. Who does that in vegas?!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was not what I was expecting from how everyone described it.  Maybe my mind went in \"pre-blown\", but I and the other three people I went with were not impressed.  The restaurant's decor and style was a lot of fun and looked nice, but the food options were confusing with how the menu was set up and a secret menu that is only secret if you don't look at the TC screen?  After figuring out the menu and what we wanted, we received our meals... this was the disappointing part... the food was just meh, not bad, but not great.    I will not be eating here again, but I know a lot of people who love it.  I know this isn't the most helpful review, but I don't think you will be missing out on anything if you don't eat here."}
{"text":"Food is great. REALLY great.   I just walked in to place a to-go order & walked right out. Why?  This place is extremely small. The place is packed & the line to order wrapped around the corner & almost to the door. That people are standing everywhere & people sitting at the window crammed the entrance...forget it.   You are better off paying their delivery fee & staying home."}
{"text":"After months of listening about how amazing this place is, I've finally made it in to try out SkinnyFat's delicious food for myself! This tiny hidden gem was easy to spot among the monotonous business buildings; who can pass up stopping in a place that has a huge smiley on their doors?! Although their space is tiny for the amount of people that love their food, the ambience is very laid back, and the staff is on their game. They handle the crowd well and with a positive attitudes. Now, about the food, any place that has jalepeno ketchup on their tables is my kind of restaurant!!! You can't beat the freshness of their entree items. We ate the Cranburkey with truffle fries and the Tu-Nuts. Both dishes were so delicious, had fresh, very fresh produce and satisfied without needing to have someone roll me out of the restaurant. Did I mention there was jalapeno ketchup?!?! Five stars all the way. I'm coming back next week to try more of their amazing menu."}
{"text":"Decent food but the white girl with blonde hair who works the register was very rude, will not go back due to poor customer service and a bad attitude"}
{"text":"It was amazing. The food tasted great. We had the spudghetti, a biscuit with filet minion, and another burger of some sort. It was all very good. And the customer service was very good as well. The food was brought out in a timely manner and the waiter who took our order was very polite. Overall very good and would eat there again!!"}
{"text":"Excellent!! This restaurant is like having angel on one shoulder telling you to \"eat healthy\" and the devil on the other shoulder saying \"you can burn those calories walking the Las Vegas strip\". We went for breakfast and ordered from both sides of the menu, everything was amazing! Great place, small, offers outdoor seating. It's by the airport so the view is of the jets taking off. Wonderful. Would've been 5 stars if the restaurant was bigger."}
{"text":"Bomb grub, unique menu, and skilled chef (Marco) working the grill. Always happy stopping in here. I would give 5 stars if it wasn't for a lackluster green juice. I ordered the Green Mile I believe and found it to be way too sweet."}
{"text":"I had the two nuts it was ahi tuna with sriracha in a cucumber boats was incredible can't wait to try something else"}
{"text":"nice little place to eat new variations of food concepts is great staff was friendly and courteous love the bomb diggity."}
{"text":"Love the concept of having healthy vs less healthy options. Wish there was one by me! We got the steak eyes Wakin bacon Smoke in a bowl Smotgerload Applebottom toast  I don't have anything negative to say about anything!!  The juices and protein drinks are awesome too."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is the place to eat!  Whoever you are, and whatever food requirements they can accomodate. Such a chill environment, and tasty plus healthy food. My boyfriend had the Portobello sandwich. The owner came out and told my boyfriend to put hummus on it. Interesting combo. I think mine was called ahi nuts. It was a cucumber boat filled with ahi and had a combo of yum yum sauce and maybe teriyaki sauce. Super tasty! Definitely will be back! Such a positive vibe and super friendly staff. Did I mention this place is awesome?"}
{"text":"Love the food and the options even though the happy menu items are always calling out to me! My only complaint is that finding seating can get a bit overwhelming, but it won't stop me from coming here."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place from all the reviews. Ordered the Filet O Fire which was delicious and my husband had the Big Parm. We waited for a seat outside and as soon as one opened up Mike was there to clean it for us. Brandon then brought our food out in a timely fashion. The service was unexpectedly amazing and both of our plates were great, we will definitely be returning back!"}
{"text":"First time here and we were surprised on the great quality of the food. Service was friendly and the restaurant was very clean!  Not a fan of sweet potato fries but this is the place to order it."}
{"text":"Food was great. Parking sucked. My living room might be bigger than the dining room, the biggest table only had 4 seats. Went there (Dean Martin Dr. location) with some friends from San Diego. Our party was three adults and two children. They have a kids menu, but the very small venue isn't very family friendly. The smallest child sat on mom's lap as there was no room to add a high chair to the end of the table."}
{"text":"If you like a variety of good for your waistline and your tastebuds, you need to eat here.    I love the selection of lite, indulgent, and creative menu items.  We can take a group of picky eaters and kids here and find something for everyone.  I highly recommend the fresh juices.  There is a secret menu and you can see their creations on Instagram.     The restaurant can be busy at anytime of day.  Don't be discouraged, it is worth the wait!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh and quality steak in my bleu NY salad. Not too much dressing which is awesome and filled me up."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed in that place, love there juices too! This is one of my favorite spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today. The classic burger was excellent. My friend had three of their tacos and he really enjoyed them as well."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!! Service was awesome and their sweet potato fries have to be the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I have only ever written 1 other Yelp review and usually do not make a point of doing so. While a friend and I were passing through Las Vegas, however, SkinnyFATS left such a good impression on us, that I felt obliged to write something. We owe them at least that.   We had the orange juice (which was a little overpriced, but still delicious) and the breakfast wrap and french toast on the healthy side of the menu.  The food was absolutely delicious, clean, light, refreshing and just overall fantastic. Whenever I am back in Vegas, there is no doubt I will be coming back here!  thanks for being who you are SkinnyFATS!"}
{"text":"A must try in Vegas. I get something different every time I go and still to this day have not came across something I didn't like. 5 stars easily"}
{"text":"Holy glutten free cow!    Excellent find! Had the Chiquino Soup and Chicken Parm sandwich,  best meal in a long time. Great flavor and portions, it didn't leave me hungry, excellent service and very clean.  definitely going back.    The outdoor sign isn't lit at night, it's on the  south side of the railroad track."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by my awesome friend and finally decided to try it. Warning: it does get packed, come before or after lunch. Place is rather small and kinda of hard to find.   I had the chicken n waffles: definitely love the chicken; it was crunchy n moist. The waffles had a crunch to it and it just melted in my mouth lol.   Will try more of the menu but definitely everything is fresh and cooked to order"}
{"text":"Not impressed...The food choices are ok..some items are better than others. I really like the nachos and sodas. I usually order to go, but when I go in go pick it up, no one acknowledges  me or asks if I need help. I have to wait for the cashier to finish ringing people up,so i can let her know I'm there to pick up my order. One cashier, a young black girl, very rude gave me this look like \"what do you want\". I did not appreciate the attitude. She did not even ask what I needed she just stared at me waiting for me to ask her for my food. Even the runners didn't bother asking me if I was being helped. They saw me standing there and just kept doing their business. These young employees could use some customer service pointers."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  The interior is slick. The help is friendly. But there are some glaring issues that need to be resolved:  1. The success of the business has led to occupancy problems. The place is packed. All the time. Space restrictions force you to plan out your visit there. You'll have to know what you want and bring a friend to scout for a place to sit while you wait in line to order.  2. The staff does not seem to communicate to each other very well and there seems to be little direction. During peak times I cannot figure out what each counter staffs function is other than to do whatever it is they feel like at that particular moment.  The only constant position I can observe is the person who sits at the register and take orders while everyone else chases their own tails. I cannot comment on the kitchen direction though as there is not enough open view behind the overcrowded eating area.  3. Don't bother trying to order over the phone. When they are red lining beyond the usual total chaos they will let the caller go to voicemail. If you do get through, plan on bring pissed off when you go to pick up your order. There is no separate pickup counter or window.  You'll have to sit in the line and wait to pay. I have on 3 separate occasions paid for the pickup and waited over 20 min for someone to bring the order up without apology. This is a direct communication error between front counter and kitchen staff. Particularly because there does not appear to be anyone responsible for ensuring over the phone pickup orders are tended to.  Overall all these problems fall squarely on managements shoulders. Please remedy."}
{"text":"Skinnies is the BEST! I've been here with many friends and recommended it to everyone! Nothing on their menu is less than amazing! The chefs have some kind of weird taste in how they put random things together, but it tastes amazing every time! Love this place! It's always packed, though, wish it had more locations or a bigger place to sit!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I love to try new places. Found this joint and fell in love. Veg-to-bowl is my fave. Tofu and veggies. Soo yummy I can eat it all the time.    I suggest you call your order in. It gets really busy during lunch time and parking sucks"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here and there were 7 of us who came for brunch. The wait wasn't too long for us to receive our food which was great. I'm only going to review on 2 dishes since that's all I tasted. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken had a good crispy skin, but the chicken itself was a little bit dry and I thought the waffle lacked flavor. I asked my niece who ordered the same thing how she liked it and she also said that her chicken was a little dry. On a good note, my hubby ordered the S'motherload which includes filet mignon, egg, sausage, potatoes, peppers, onions and pico in a tortilla w/ cajun cheese sauce. I really enjoyed his dish and ended up picking off his plate"}
{"text":"Honestly I usually always have an amazing meal when I eat at Skinny Fats. Last time I ordered the cranburger from there and it tasted like plastic. Do not recommend that burger but everything else on the menu is awesome. The line is always really long every time I go in so I recommend ordering online for pick up!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  I eat healthy and so do my friends.  Even my co workers love the great taste of some of the less healthy and diet coconscious choices.  This place is for everyone.  The food is delicious, healthy flavorful and filling at a very affordable price.  Definitely one of my all time favs!"}
{"text":"What can I say, S'motherload! Eggs, shaved NY strip, sausage, potatoes, bacon, cheddar, onions and peppers delicately wrapped in a tortilla and topped with just enough Cajun cheddar sauce to bring an element of sophistication to this breakfast offering!  Staff super friendly and great strong coffee! If you have breakfast anywhere else you're a fool! Don't let this mouth orgasm experience pass you by!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Menu is so fun and unique. My only complaint is that I wish they had more seating! Wasn't easy to squeeze a group of 4 adults and 2 toddlers in the small area that was available."}
{"text":"First time here. The punch is DELICIOUS!! Only reason I give 5 stars is it is a bit on the expensive side. For 3 of us $57.00 dollars! I'll definitely come back for the punch, but it sucks I wouldnt make this a more frequent place I would come for budgeting families."}
{"text":"Been waiting ages for them to open this location in my neighborhood. As expected, the food was glorious. The staff went above and beyond rolling out the red carpet and there were none of the kinks you'd usually expect with a new restaurant. If you've never been to skinnyFATS before, the easiest way to explain its virtues is that the menu is amazing. Many many really great dishes and great flavor combinations. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant in an office park.  Small but we were able to get a table at noon-ish during the week.  I had the turkey burger and regular fires.  The turkey burger was great.  Very flavorful, spot on!  The fries were cold and therefore were left uneaten.  My friend had the sweet potato fries which were hot and tastes awesome!  Next time I hope I'll get hot fries!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, reasonable prices. They had truffle fries which is a rarity in restaurants nowadays. Customer service was great. The only downside is that the seating is somewhat limited if you're coming in very large groups. But other than that, its a great place. If in the area, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"This place is the spot and has such a cool concept (even if I find myself opting for the Happy options over the Healthy....) The applebottom toast, nice to greek you pizza, and the Tu-Nuts are all my go-tos. This place can get PACKED around lunch time, so keep that in mind if you're short on time. The only thing I'd like to see is more alcoholic drink options, lol. The ambiance is great; when it's not peak hours, this is a chill spot to grab some lunch and get some work/study done. Free wifi!"}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is delicious! One of my favorite spots for healthy meals and they also have a happy side on their menu. Highly recommended spot to eat!"}
{"text":"Interesting food  Best tasting shake thar Ive had in a long time. Always seems to be busy. Nice change"}
{"text":"I ordered a veggie burger to go. 40 min later I still don't have it. I finally asked what happened and they said they someone lost my order. How the heck is that even possible in this day in age. She put in the computer. They refunded me but I'm still not happy. Total BS!"}
{"text":"Their spicy chicken tortilla soup off of the secret menu is, by far, the nasty I have ever had."}
{"text":"The soup (the not so healthy one) was bomb AF ; service good. Staff is polite and helpful."}
{"text":"I enjoy the variety this restaurant offers you. The skinny menu 's the far menu is genius. I love the ahi tuna tacos and their fries. Their selection of food items is so different from any other restaurant it's worth coming here all the time. Always something new to try. Great hip place to enjoy good and drinks."}
{"text":"I love there coffee.  Actually I really like half of there menu and not just the happy or healthy side.  I think all there food is really fresh and flavorful but I just am a picky eater and some flavors I just dont like.    If you want a fun place to go eat with a different type of menu then this place is for you."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants ever!!! They have new items as well.  I ate the Salmon overboard and the Thai Cobb salad and it was soooo good.  The decor is on point and the staff was super cheerful.  Very happy with my experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my colleagues and holy moly was this place happening. The music, the people, and of course...The food was unbelievable.  I'm no food critic, but my ahi tacos were bomb.com and my hangover remedy juice definitely did the trick!"}
{"text":"Good food regardless what mood your in indulge or be healthy either way your set! Had a Juan wrap that was good,and my wife had some crazy looking waffles that were great. My son chowed on chocolate pankakes"}
{"text":"Wish we could've tried it.  Walked in and the place was packed. It was super clean and smelled great. Unfortunately, there was not enough seating to accommodate us so we left.  Hopefully they expand soon so we can give it a try and update our review."}
{"text":"Been here many times and love it! The food is always fresh, delicious, prepared to order in a timely manner, and the staff are always very friendly and welcoming. Their menu has a decent variety including breakfast and lunch items. They offer juices and shakes as well! The price point isn't bad either for the quality of food you get there. Definitely check them out if you get a chance...."}
{"text":"Great food, very tasty sandwiches with healthy ingredients. Probably best sandwich shop in town!!!"}
{"text":"The calorie listings for meals definitely makes you think twice about what you order! Good food and unique twists on some traditional items-- such as the BLT's use of turkey bacon and a smokey flavored dressing. Thumbs up for this restaurant option. Now we just need one downtown."}
{"text":"This place is a must! I was really excited to try as I've heard nothing but great things. We ordered from both menus and both were equally as delicious. The only bad thing I'd have to say is that it's an extremely small place. Beware that there may not be any seating available."}
{"text":"I had the Hot Chix and it very good.  The location was small, but the staff was friendly.  Definitely a place you need to try!"}
{"text":"Every time I eat here I find something delicious ! Even took my mother to experience this restaurant when she visited. Absolutely LOVE the turnip tacos but everything I've tried has been delicious !"}
{"text":"The food is great and they have a seprate menu that is all vegetarian. Fresh squeezed juices and custom made health and happy options"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have awesome customer service and excellent food. This is my go to place and no other place will beat it. If you've never been here, you haven't tasted amazing food."}
{"text":"Nice change from all the fast food junk places!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! They've done an amazing job! The food, the atmosphere and the energy!!!!! I wanna move in!"}
{"text":"I love skinny fats, BUUUT chicken parm sandwich was not good at all! Definitely would not recommend"}
{"text":"Food is always great, and they have such a friendly staff. Would have given 5 stars, but last time I was there they burned my cookie. :("}
{"text":"I got the Ahi Taco San and the Meltdown with a side of sweet potato fries. I enjoyed my taco but the burger in my melt was bland. I don't know why restaurants these days have an issue with adding seasoning to their burgers I'll take simple salt and pepper if nothing else. My friend got a Meanbean and a side of hummus that \"if I closed my eyes and tasted this I'd think it was an organic toothpaste.\"  I don't eat hummus but she said it seemed as though they'd just boiled the chickpeas and then mashed them up. Again no salt. The Meanbean?...say it with me...NO SALT. My sweet potato fries were sickly sweet. They're sweet potato fries you don't need to add sugar and vanilla to them . Basically we won't be back even though I liked my taco I won't be able to convince them to try a different location especially since I'm writing this in the parking lot of a Whole Foods while they find something to eat.   P. S. The staff were very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Smallish, very clean space that is decorated with flare outside and in (see photos). Clientele includes parents with young ones in high chairs, gym work-out buddies, and wifi seekers such as myself. It does get busy but seems to have just enough space to seat everyone. Chairs are comfortable, tables seat two or four, and a long high bar with stools comes with a row of outlets for laptops, plus a view of McCarran airport planes taking off.   Food? Great to delicious. Half of the menu lists healthy eats, the other half \"happy\" options. Their drunken gypsy french toast is brilliant and comes with perfect applewood bacon. I usually don't bother with syrup, but theirs is divine. Truffle fries are tasty. Filter coffee is fine.   Service is friendly and attentive. Staff try hard to make a great impression on each patron.   Great reputation they have and most deserve. I'm a repeat customer.  Only con: Sometimes the music is super loud."}
{"text":"I love you SkinnyFats. There is absolutely nothing I tried on the menu that wasn't mouthwateringly delicious, and the fresh juices and shakes always hit the spot.   Healthy+Delicious+Great service=Top choice for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place has great food and is constantly adding new items to its menu for the seasons. My all time favorite is the Cherry Popper Burger and I like the sweat potato fries with it. They are sweeter than any other sweet potato fry I've had. Tasty for sure!! I'm not huge on the \"skinny side\", for I embrace the \"fat side\" but nothing on there sounds bad to me. This place is great for a variety menu. Especially for those who want healthy too."}
{"text":"Ok so being a tourist in Vegas is often times hard because the draw is the craziness of the strip and everything it offers. Which is often times overpriced sub par food. We went to SkinnyFats tonight and absolutely loved it. Everyone was pleased by the end of the night and we may go back before we leave. The atmospheres is cool, the staff was super friendly and the food was ah inspiring. They have everything from breakfast foods to awesome dinner entrees and with 8 guests we tested them all. I am rarely this impressed."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! My boyfriend surprised me last night!! It's definitely a diamond in the rough:)"}
{"text":"Totally not what we expected - but pleasantly surprised!!! Service excellent!  Staff friendly!  Food was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Quick service, the staff is super friendly and even their indulgent food items aren't greasy! Food can get messy though but so worth it"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Love the decor.  Great place to eat"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  They deliver and it is FAST.  The delivery guy got here in less than 45 mins!!  He was so nice and friendly, I have no idea how he stays in such a good mood while he's working lol.  I got the neato burrito thing, the naked chix (chicken), the Caprese (caprazy lol) salad and the adventure juice made with ice cream (kids size).  Obviously I haven't eaten everything yet or else I would have exploded by now.  I ate half the burrito and the juice/shake thing and I am stuffed!  I tried a tiny bite of everything else and it was all very good.  I can't wait to eat it all later today.  This place is gonna make me go from skinny to fat real quick. :("}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem after am exhausting crossfit workout. Highly recommend. Healthy good tasting fast food that is reasonably priced, I really couldn't ask for anything more. But wait an environmentally conscious cup that is reusable, you just made me a repeat customer! Love the decor, loved the food, loved the concept!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab food off the strip. In fact, I went there twice in 3 days! The serving sizes are good, the food is tasty and the coffee is decent. It gets pretty crowded early on so I do suggest going early vs later in the day."}
{"text":"Awesome food and excellent staff at this location. Went to their other one location near the airport and it was really small and staff wasn't as great, and they don't have any outdoor seating.. Food is great though!"}
{"text":"Seating is ridiculous. It's a very small place and seating is first come first serve. We came at lunch time which was a big mistake. You order your food at the counter but have to wait for a seat. People will swoop in and take a seat as you are ordering your food. So you have to stand there staring at others who are eating with a hurry up look on your face. Seems like a fight waiting to happen. Food is good but not \"oh my gosh that food was amazing\" enough for us to go back and fight for a seat. At least I can say I've been there. We won't be returning. Figure out your seating issue SKINNYFATS! Then you'll earn my return business."}
{"text":"What a cute restaurant! Aside from the food, the merchandise you can buy is also super fun. The portions are fairly large on the happy side and just right on the healthy side. The prices are extremely reasonable for the amount and quality of food and since I know you're wondering, Yes, the coffee is excellent! I was impressed at how fast this place turns tables. Although it can look super packed upon arrival, by the time you place your order, there is usually a table just finishing and the servers are super quick to clear the tables and get the next people seated. I appreciated the friendliness and attentiveness of the servers. They were also very knowledgeable of the menu. Highly recommended breakfast/brunch place in LV!"}
{"text":"La la la laaaav this place and the concept! My first time dining here did not disappoint. Quick and easy ordering at the counter, not so easy trying to find a seat around lunch time.   I ordered the Naked Chix with a side of Caulifire and it was soo bomb! I inhaled it and licked the bowl to the very last buffalo sauce drop lol I also ordered a special that day which was a pizza waffle of some sort. Can't go wrong with pizza or waffles! I did feel the waffle is a bit on the sweeter side so if you're going into your first bite thinking it'll have a bread-like-crusty-taste, guess again. Delicious nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a healthy meal. You won't be disappointed. The Mean Bean was awesome! Add some sweet potato fries and you're set. Will definitely be coming back here on my next visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It was pretty good to me, but my wife loved it, hence the 4 stars.  You can choose from healthy or not healthy on the menu.    They do a twist to all average food that you're familiar with."}
{"text":"We first went to eat here when they first opened and now we try to come at least once a month. When we have visitors in town we take them here to have a great meal. You can't go wrong with whatever you order. Everything taste so good! Our favorite is the cheeseburger benedict.   Decor and vibe when you walk in just seems cozy and laid-back.   I recommend this place to many friends and they all love and rave about the food.  I can't wait until they open the new locations closer to home."}
{"text":"I don't like many things on the menu here, but I had a craving for the Hot Chix salad today. I stopped by during lunch and they are usually busy, so I placed my order to-go. I then waited about 45 minutes for my food to realize that my order was wrong. I let the waitress know and when I got my food back I could clearly see that the cook just dumped the bleu cheese off and put everything back together. I even checked my receipt to make sure that it said \"no bleu cheese\". It did. Honestly, I was appalled. Their service is usually good and the food is pretty moderate, but this made me feel like they literally don't care about their customers. I'm glad I'm not allergic or have an intolerance."}
{"text":"First off, it's super tucked away with a barely there sign lol. Drive slow or you will miss it lol.   When you walk in it's super cute but small. Staff is very friendly and if it's your first time they are happy to explain their menu! They have a healthy side and a happy side on their menu. I'm sure you can guess why the happy side is called what it is.   Food is really good, from what I've tried. I always order the ahi sirachi taco. They have 2 versions of this. The ahi sirachi is the one on the healthy side and surprisingly much better than the ahi taco on the happy side. And it's only like 3 bucks for one taco that is a pretty good size. It's a must if you go to SkinnyFATS."}
{"text":"So, who says there are no healthy places in vegas and that all places are buffets? Well those people choose to stay on the strip and not explore what Vegas has to offer. My friend from LV introduced me to this place when I came out for the weekend to DJ. Ever since I turned my bad eating habits around, I wanted to see what healthy alternatives are out there and this was one of my favorite places. Actually, this is definitely on my go to list.  The menu here is a split menu, one side is some what healthy and the other is healthy. They also have vegetarian and vegan options. The menu is also flexible enough to accommodate any diet. I went full on vegan about a year ago and was ecstatic when the girl behind the counter told me that they can modify the majority of the menu to be vegan. Whohoo!  So the first day here, I had: - mean bean vegan burger with garlic fries (minus the cheese)  - frickles   Second day I had: - Buffalo Cauliflower - VEGWICH (no horseradish mayo to make it vegan)  So my take on it? Amazing, they need to open one down here in so-cal."}
{"text":"I ordered the berry strong meal and all I can say is DELICIOUS!!!! Yelpers, you have to try this when coming here. The staff are all super friendly and I like the ambiance as well....."}
{"text":"I really appreciate the follow up. They handled my concern professionally and in a very timely fashion. I've returned to my favorite location and all is well at SkinnyFats Warm Springs. Thanks for caring!"}
{"text":"Our go to place for great quality, healthy food! I live in Vegas part time and while the options are plenty here they're not always healthy. This place is a saving grace for healthy options! All the salads are incredible and their sandwiches are equally delicious. We introduced it to our kids, and they always have to grab a bite when they're in town! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing the chix on Broadway has to be my favorite, protein style is the best! The classic has to be one of if not the best burger here in town. The truffle fires are addicting and are perfect extra crispy style. Honestly everything from breakfast to their Sunday's Sunday is wonderful"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmmm! This place is super good!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place a couple weeks ago after a friend told me about it. Was in town for business and came here for dinner before heading to the airport. It seems to be in a business park of some sort but was close to the airport so it was perfect. Looked over the menu and everything looked really good. Our waitress was super friendly and helped suggest a few dishes. We couldn't decide so we ordered 3 dishes between the 2 of us. My friend eats a lot so I knew it wasn't a problem! Everything was awesome. I can't remember the names of all the dishes we got but trust me, everything was really good. The BEST dish was the Merica, it's shaved NY strip chicken fried over biscuits n' gravy w/ 3 eggs. That was awesome!!! They have really creative names on the menu with both healthy and happy options. Definitely will go back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food was great; very flavorful and delicious. But the reason i will return is because of the service. Kate, the cashier, made our first visit a memorable experience. Kate was kind enough to go through the entire menu with us, the popular dishes, and their secret menu. Best customer service i have ever experienced. Thank you Kate, my wife and i will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere - hard to come by in Vegas.  I had the fish taco-san for an afternoon snack.  It was delicious and the presentation was very thoughtful.  Everything that I saw in front of other customers also looked delicious.  The only negative is that the prices are a little high for me.  You've got to spend $10+ for lunch.  But you get what you pay for.  These guys care about product quality, taste and presentation.    I'll be back."}
{"text":"One Word: Absolutely Delicious! Okay that's two words but I can't describe this place without using more than one word. It is Just that good :) It's a hip, trendy place with a unique twist to their menu, which carries a healthy and a happy side. The healthy side of the menu carries a different alternative to the \"happy\" side which is a more healthy, cleaner eating, yet both equally delicious!  I came here with my boyfriend and had the Ahi Srirachi, which were tacos filled with fresh ahi tuna and the most amazing mixture of pico de gallo and special sauce. Happymess, a combination of steak, blue cheese, and french fries with a bit of pico de gallo. The combination in this was just absolutely delicious, especially with the truffle oil! We also had the parsnip fries :) which was pretty much gone. Who knew parsnip fries would be soo good!   With all these joints opening up in Vegas, its nice to go somewhere where you can just relax, enjoy some great food, and come back again. I'm such a fan of places that make you feel like you've known them for years and this place is definitely welcoming."}
{"text":"I do not get why any of you think the food is Good here .... OR HEALTHY!!! Where are the Nutritional Facts for any item on these menus? Anyone ever think about that. I was really happy to think there was a Healthy Restaurant here that was hip and fun but what I thought about this place does not represent what any of you went through.  The place is Crowded and smells Funny.  I ordered the Ahi Tacos and you can use some salt, Use sea salt for God's Sake.  It's Healthy and good for you.  Those were the driest nastiest fish tacos I have eaten in my life and I am very well traveled.  If you think no flavor means healthy you would be incorrect.    My Boyfriend got their french fries so I tried a couple DISGUSTING they are drowned in a low grade Truffle oil and taste HORRIBLE!   The Sweet Potato fries were just ok.  They do not use any Fruits or Vegetables in Season, so they do not seem to know much about what they are doing.  The food cooked there is MEDIOCRE AT BEST!  Why this place gets crowded is BEYOND BELIEF!   Tell the cooks to learn how to cook out of passion and not out of routine. And put some nutritional Facts up about your food.  I want to know what I ingest and how much work I need to do later.    And I got a Milkshake, It was so RUNNY it wasn't a shake at all. It was MILK! Learn how to make a milkshake. If I could give you 0 Stars I would have.   If you go here thinking this is some good food obviously your Pallet has never been refined to great foods.  This place is gross."}
{"text":"Fan.. menu items are thoughful and unique"}
{"text":"Delicious Food ***** Great Atmosphere ***** Very Nice Servers ***** Always inviting **** I'm never disappointed ***** Parking ***"}
{"text":"Very good. I thought it would be like all \"healthy\" places or foods; tasteless and boring and leaving me still hungry at the end, but no, this place is actually pretty good! The dishes my Wife, Daughter and I had were booming with flavor and servings were filling. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I looooove this place its a bit small and you may experience a bit of a wait however it is SOOOOOO worth it. The service is great and I cant get enough of their variety of juices and menu items."}
{"text":"Such a great little restaurant!! Went here 3 times in 2 days! So affordable, great customer service, and delicious food! Ordered the cranburkey burger and the terriyaki ahi tuna sandwich. Both with a side of delicious fresh fruit! Also ordered the smoky bbq chicken bowl(forgot the name) it had rice, agave bbq chicken, black bean salsa, and veggies. Not the best, but still good. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. Location was different which awesome and food was fantastic! !!!!! This is a late review but better late then never !"}
{"text":"I knocked off a star because of how small the location is. I have heard rumors that suggest they are looking at bigger locations which I hope is true.    Food is yummy. Had the ahi taco & for the prize I am in total Ah! Everything is so well put together... Toppings to sauce its an A+   Shakes are decently priced & tasty but in my opinion their juices are a tad over priced.   I also had a latte & that was well crafted too.  Kudos to Skinnyfats. Hope you expand soon!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and also my last. My husband ordered the Brie French toast and I ordered the WTFrench toast. I took one bite of mine and was immediately disgusted. It was like eating a hamburger between unflavorful French toast slices and sour berries spread around. I tried my husband's, hoping his would taste far better than mine, but that was disappointing as well. We had also ordered a side of sweet potato fries, which I will say were pretty good, but that was, unfortunately, the only decent part of our visit."}
{"text":"I've been here half a dozen times and have never had a bad meal. The menu mirrors similar menu selections in a healthy and less heathy version. Full disclosure, I have yet to try anything from the \"skinny\" side, because everything on the \"fat\" side looks, and truly is!"}
{"text":"Happy Mess was great! Truffle fries...yum. Like the casual atmosphere..I think I was the oldest guy there!"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this by accident on the last day in LV.  The food is awesome and price is right compared to LV strip prices.  We wish we discovered it on our first day as it's only 5 minutes from our hotel.  It's in an industrial area but don't judge the book by its cover. The food is delish!"}
{"text":"I had the Happymess not exactly healthy never the less it was amazing!  Truffle fries with shaved NY steak pico & bleu."}
{"text":"Burger was good. Sweet potatoes fries were burned and cold. Cookies were also cold despite website saying they would be warm. Service was courteous and okay for the most part. Food could be improved."}
{"text":"They deliver breakfast to my house. Breakfast!! Who does that? And you can order food online! Why should I ever eat dominos again?"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I am definitely coming back! I had the #merica, which is the fried chicken with the most delicious sausage gravy over 2 biscuits. Very fattening, but definitely a cheat meal that is worth it. This place feels like you're eating at one of those fancy places on the strip, but not as pricy and actually better than what I've had on the Vegas strip. This place is definitely worth making the venture off the strip for."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. The truffle fries were ok but the Ahi tacos was just yummy. Need to come back and try other stuff on the menu...maybe more preferably the skinny side hehe"}
{"text":"Great Food! Happy and Healthy, I prefer the Happy side but Skinny Fats has something for any appetite."}
{"text":"Wonderful choices for everyone. Healthy and not so healthy. But no worries, even the healthy options are full of flavor. I love the sweet potato fries!  I just wish they had plain water instead of water with cucumbers in it."}
{"text":"Ate here at lunchtime...doing a great business...constant stream of patrons.  No calorie count on the entrées (I had read that on an earlier review), but I had the \"Classic\" in mind...calories be dam#%d!  It was a monster 1/2 pounder piled about 4-1/2\" high with a side of \"truffle fries\" (a.k.a. Fries...nothing special about the fries).  This burger had to be cut in half and I had to open wide to get this one into the digestive process.  It had the usual \"stuff\" atop the mildly seasoned meat but tasted Okay...no sensational hyperbole here.  It was just \"alright\" and more than a bit messy.  Ok atmosphere and cool menu, and noisy.  The concept is quite good...choose items lean in nature or fattening...very clever and a natural eye catcher menu.  I'd go back...maybe i just didn't choose wisely"}
{"text":"It was wonderful! I'll definitely eat here again. I had the caulifire bites (awesome) the yogurt sauce made them for sure.  And the zucci noodle dish it was great too. It was super smokey (don't know if it's legit or just flavoring) but it was still great. My juice drink was excellent as well. Nice place, I'm certain to eat here again."}
{"text":"I was staying at a hotel down the block and wanted to get out from a healthy brunch.  This place was great. Fun decor and very acceptable food."}
{"text":"What a cool place to have breakfast or lunch! Found it on Yelp! We will be back when visiting Vegas again."}
{"text":"A lot of my friends talked this place up and I was excited to try it for that reason, and also because of how close it is to my house.   I will not be returning.  I ordered a chicken sandwich no sauce. It came out with sauce, burnt. I sent it back. It came back again, no sauce, but burnt...again. What are the chances the chicken is going to be burned twice in a row? I'm talking so burnt it hurt my mouth to chew. Oh, and they burned my husband's chicken also. How do people burn fried chicken?   The ONE diet soda choice in the whole restaurant had no syrup. Told some employee about it. In the forty minutes I sat at my table, no one at the restaurant fixed it. I paid 2 bucks or whatever it was for a soda cup to fill it with water. Like, I'm already blowing my day's calories on this mediocre chicken sandwich - can't you put some damn calorie free syrup in your machine so I can drink my money's worth in soda? NO? Oh okay.   Overpriced. Oh boy is this place overpriced. Restaurant prices for a fast food type experience. Yeesh. You'd have better luck taking your money and buying one of everything at the Sonic right across the parking lot. You'd probably enjoy something at Sonic more too.  I'm giving it two stars because the food wasn't so bad that it was inedible and the inside of the restaurant was modern and hip. Never going back, however."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is good but holy mother of waiting. Have fun finding a table. The food takes FOREVER to come out. My gf and I came here and I ordered the Juan burrito and an ahi siracha and she ordered a skinny bowl. We waited 30 plus mins for my food (understandable because they have to cook it)  and I finished eating it and waited an additional 15 mins before she even got hers. Good concept. Can't wait for them to iron the new business growing pains and I'll be a frequent customer :)"}
{"text":"Skinnyfats is seriously my favorite place to eat in Vegas.   Food: Chicken and waffles and the truffle fries are so good here. For drinks I also get one of those smoothies, the delightful cucumber. I love it so much and can't get myself to try the other smoothies. My boyfriend is usually more adventurous and tries the specials. It is a little on the pricier side. Probably $10+ per plate but definitely worth it. We have yet to be disappointed with the food here.   Service: the girls here are so nice. The first time we went they walked us through the menu and explained everything.   Seriously my boyfriend and I come here at least once a moth. Definitely recommend trying it"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise is in store for you... Not only is the staff informative and polite the food was awesome and there system works This is not your run of the mill \" joint\" very trendy awesome combinations of flavor we would never think of and an ever changing menu to keep you coming back for more... Which I will thanks skinny fats just what Las Vegas needs see ya Sunday"}
{"text":"As all the locals know so worth the wait Very unique breakfast or check out the \"secret menu\""}
{"text":"Love this place..never once have been disappointed with the food or service. But they do need more seating. During busy times it could get a little claustrophobic in there. I just wish they had tables/umbrellas outdoors for the overflow.."}
{"text":"I tried the ahi shrimp tempura tacos with mango salsa! It's was delicious.   The mango salsa with the ahi tasted delicious together with a nice healthy soda.  Great lunch to have wasn't too light or too heavy.  It was perfect."}
{"text":"Excellent. Chicken fingers and truffle fries are top notch.   P. S. Try the chocolate chip cookies"}
{"text":"Haven't eaten yet. Ordered online for carryout and four of our five orders and one of our drink orders were wrong. I mean, the recipe is scratched out as if someone went down the list preparing the food and yet my filet burger had a big chunk of chicken on it.  The place is really small, so you'll be waiting for your food anyway. Though I highly suggest not coming in the first place. It's been two hours waiting for five meals, no food could possibly be good enough to make the wait worthwhile. The one order that was correct ( teriyaki bowl) tasted rushed, with dry tough meat, so I'm not expecting much.   The worst thing is that the people who work here don't really seem to care that our order is completely wrong.   I wouldn't risk wasting your time with this place, especially if youre just visiting and hoping to use your time wisely. Vegas must have better.  Update: representative of restaurant responded to my review in a caring and considerate manner, showing that the problems I encountered weren't down to a lack of caring, something I have no sympathy for. Still, its hard for me to recommend going here with a large group and little time.   Oh and service frustrations aside the food was solid. Pita and hummus wasnt good at all, the toast they use is excellent, everything was fresh, the mix of ingredients were above average but nothing spectacular. Depending on what you get 3.5-4 star"}
{"text":"Skinny fats is one of my favorite spots, my coworkers & I are constantly ordering take out but today I ordered for delivery & when I received my side of \"fresh\" fruit. My grapes were moldy :( this is very disappointing because I really did love this place. That honestly disgusted me. Not sure what else goes bad there."}
{"text":"The woman taking our order told us we HAD to get the chicken and waffles, so we did and we were completely underwhelmed. The chicken was overcooked a bit and didn't have a ton of flavor.  The other item we ordered was a pancake (more like a donut) with nutella and fruit. It was super yummy, but they did not bring out the nutella with the food and then brought it to our table like 15 minutes later, when we were already done with the plate.  There are a lot of options in Vegas so I don't know if I would return although there were quite a few menu items I'd like to try, so maybe I would have better luck with other dishes."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  I was thinking I would eat more off of the healthy side, but ended up with multiple items off of the tasty side.  Very busy with a smallish location so be aware of that before you make the trek to find it."}
{"text":"Love this place the customer service is great. Even though this place is always packed it's still worth the wait. We go here often and try different things and there is nothing I can complain about. My favorite is the buff chix and happymess!!"}
{"text":"Went to the location on warm springs and it was definitely busy at lunch hour. Even though there were a lot of people there, my food came out super fast. I got the most basic cheeseburger and truffle fries and it was really good. The person who took my order asked how I liked my burger cooked and I said medium and it came out well done, that's really my only complaint. There are so many options though, I'm sure I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Stopped by today wirh the husband and baby. Great atmosphere, great food, and great service. Would definitely not here again. Way too much food to choose from which is a great thing. I give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"It's Great food but a little bit expensive but it worst it I love it and every one that I send there"}
{"text":"I ordered a \"Meltdown\" burger and my fiancée ordered a \"More Cow Bowl.\" They were both absolutely delicious. If you enjoy good food, this place is worth a trip away from the strip. Great concept, great food, and good service."}
{"text":"Great place!!! Steak eyes are terrific!! The kids had whole wheat pancakes that were great!! My wife had the blue cheese steak salad that was also terrific. The place is not that big inside and is first come first serve for seating. Great experience."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere. Great food. Service was awesome and the menu can be catered to any size group and their food choice. Outdoors is great with the heater too. Five thumbs up."}
{"text":"Sweet Cheesus this place is great!  My husband wants to eat his way through the menu.  Haven't been disappointed yet!  Always seems to be crowded. They make a special sundae every Sunday."}
{"text":"Unbelievable - so good!  In an off beat location, nice office park, can miss it if you are not paying attention.   This place is the bomb - so tasty and fresh.    I'd go back a lot...hit this place for sure."}
{"text":"Menu had my mouthwatering! Pretty good place, cool atmosphere. Theres a lot of variety offered here.  Only thing is that it was so busy no seats to eat, small space & the prices kind of high, but I guess because the menus unique."}
{"text":"The food and presentation were good and the staffs were very friendly!!! We will definitely come back next time and try their cold press juice."}
{"text":"Great food and service with a smile. Call ahead and have your meal ready when you arrive because the que (\"line\" for our American foodies) gets long quickly. Fans of sashimi should try the ahi sirrachi tacos and/or the teriyaki sandwich. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for breakfast. I had the Berry Strong waffle and my wife had the Apple Bottom toast and both were quite good. The vibe is very urban. It is located at a business park, so look for the billboard."}
{"text":"Everything we had was good! Happymess and slawchee was delish lost a star for rare meat. Buff chix and chuxon broadway were good as well. I love places like this just wish they had more seating.   Since my first visit we have attempted to go back and try more items, since it was so delish the first time. Unfortunately... We could not find parking, line is usually out the door, packed with not enough seating.   I hope you expand soon. I would love to try more of your menu items."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The food was fabulous. No complaints here. I had the TATS sandwich with the yummus side. Flavorful. Fresh. Delicious"}
{"text":"Just at my lunch with my family and I'm upset especially when I have better expectations for skinny fats and it was considered one of my favorites but today I think I change my mind about this place! We had ordered take out because there wasn't enough seats for us. When we got home we got half of what we are supposed to have if we were to \"eat for here\" than to go! The portions were smaller and incomplete! I know this because I been here a number of times and it's not like how it should be. It was not filling at all! My 8yr old son just got two bread slices one bacon and one egg! I could have made better at home! My ahi srirachi was soggy, small and looked like it just got thrown together or left overs. My sister had the Tu- nuts and hers was cut shorter because it probably couldn't fit the container but that doesn't mean that she should get less than what she payed for! We feel we were ripped off and spent money for something that was not at all worth it!   if I had kept my receipt I would have called to make a complaint but, since I have a yelp I'll make a complaint here! Just because it was a take out it doesn't mean that they can get away with giving my family less than what it's worth. Waste of time, waste of my drive and money. They didn't have enough seating and we go home thinking we were going to have the same professionalism at home but I was way wrong. This shows how the buisness works and their work and service ethics and it's not good at all."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I couldn't wait to give this place a try. The sitting/dining concept was very messy. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was dry and over cooked as well as the chicken. The wait staff was slow to clean after customers finished. If they make a few changes I would consider another try."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I LOVED the atmosphere--very fun and whimsical. However, it was pretty busy when I arrived, and it took what I thought was a very long time just to get through the line to order. I stood in line for at least 25 minutes, and then waited another 10-15 minutes to get my food (all in all about 45 minutes from the time I walked in). I'm glad I wasn't in a hurry. I had the TATS with sweet potato fries and they were both good, but pricey for the quantity and quality. If I have to wait 45 minutes, I would honestly rather grab a quick burger from a fast food chain. I will probably be back, but will call ahead to order next time because no one likes to be hangry!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and healthy options are a big plus!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. My friend posted a picture on instagram & the food looked so good. Been going there ever since."}
{"text":"Amazing. Love the idea of a healthy side and a happy side. Food on the healthy side is just as good as the happy side."}
{"text":"The food here is so good. It all has so much flavor. I will be back for sure. Everyone is in such a good mood and I am convinced they all love their job! One employee named Miles was especially awesome!!! Love the atmosphere and all the wall art. So cool!"}
{"text":"No matter what I order from here I'm always happy. It's a change from your typical burgers, pizza, fries, etc. I definitely recommend this to everyone. They also have a healthy side for those trying to watch what they eat."}
{"text":"Great tacos, great sandwich, great waffles, great pacakes, great chicken, great enviroment, great overall"}
{"text":"Everything I've had is delicious and I'm hooked on the sweet potato fries! Yumm!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the food! Prices are fair.  Love that they have good gluten free options and that they are knowledgable about dietary concerns. Also love the atmosphere.  Glad to see a good place doing well with more locations."}
{"text":"Good choice of healthy or good fatty foods!  cookies are big and taste great! Employees are courteous and energetic. Good place to eat after a workout since it next to the gym."}
{"text":"Second time at SkinnyFats and it didn't disappoint.  Service was happy, friendly and quick.  The Dean Martin location is small but thankfully went in and was not packed. We ordered from the tasty side and off the secret menu - and it was delicious.  We will be returning soon."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS was ok.  I think that it is a little full of itself - but the food was ok.  I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Wow...I don't normally post and only do it when a place is worthy...this place is awesome.  Food is off the hook and service was great.  If your a foodie and your looking for something different...look no further."}
{"text":"Very delicious! There were so many choices... I was overwhelmed. I had the breakfast with the potatoes, eggs and sourdough bread. The way to potatoes were prepared was delicious.   I took one star off because it was really small inside and they forgot my fruit that I had asked for.. The fruit that was brought out was very wilted/ not fresh..  Otherwise, very friendly and delicious. Maybe next time I'll eat off the skinny menu..."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. It's located in a very unsuspecting location, but definitely is a hidden gem. Even though it was busy the service was quick and friendly. The food was delicious and if I'm ever nearby again I will absolutely stop in for another bite."}
{"text":"The great reviews got me to give this place a try and it's now part of my go to lunch spots. Fried chicken sandwich is epic, best in Vegas."}
{"text":"Even the cold wet weather today can't keep the customers away! Fresh squeezed strawberry lemonade and the \"Slow boat to China\" from the healthy side are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Just Yelped for food and found Skinny Fats.  I had high hopes only to be let down. We ordered 2 chicken burgers and a waffle. My bacon was good, fruit awesome, waffle cold and hard as a rock. Needed a knife to get through it. The chicken burgers looked like processed chicken?  Over all tasteless aside from the fryes. Hope your experience is better then ours."}
{"text":"Amazing place to enjoy a nice meal! My favorite is there Mean bean vegan burger! Seriously the best and so tasty and filling ! I enjoyed it with sweet potato French fries which are so good as well! I recommend this place & so happy that they have vegan options on there menu! :)"}
{"text":"The one and only downside. It's always packed and small. Reason being... The food is amazing. Ahi tacos and tempura battered anything is amazing. The food is great and for the most part it's a much healthier version of the deep fried fatty McFat boy stuff you get elsewhere. It's not all healthy but it's a nice cheat meal."}
{"text":"An absolute must try if your looking to get off the strip. There really seems to be something for everyone on the menu and breakfast all day is always a plus in Vegas. My new little fav!"}
{"text":"I am always afraid to try new places but this place did not disappoint. The haopy side was still healthy to me. I ordered the pimp shrimp and that was served on a cucumber. It was on the happy side so I thought it would have been heavier. But I am not going to complain for it being a little more on the healthier side. The service was great. I was greeted with smiles and was helped with menu options seeing it was my first time. The cookies are also a must try I had the chocolate chunk and the chunks were huge. They have a healthier version of soda that was delicious. All in all in love the concept of a healthy and happy choice. Though I think it was healthy and more healthy."}
{"text":"Love this place! The mean bean burger is amazing! The service is always outstanding. All of the juices are made fresh and very yummy!"}
{"text":"Exciting menu. Lots of healthful choices.  Protein pancakes with grilled pineapple and turkey bacon! Awesome pancake mix- whole grain with nutty taste. There were six of us and all were delighted with their bkfast choices. Great environment- wood and wall art. Lively music. What a fun place!"}
{"text":"Great attention and environment if you're shooting for the small hole-in-the-wall scene. The food was OK, it could use some more salt. I had the smoke in a bowl and a mr. Green skinny juice. If you want to have a large selection of healthy foods, give this place a try"}
{"text":"I love trying new places and although skinny fats isn't brand new, I've never been. My first visit was great! Loved the service, the food and the atmosphere! I can't wait to go back and I'm really looking forward to cold press express!"}
{"text":"Came here for late lunch/early dinner, the food was amazing, the staff is extremely nice and helpful! I had a great visit! And a special thank you to Fonzia, you made my visit thank much better!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. The food is amazing and it had a cool fun atmosphere. I literally eat here at least 2 times a week! I love the ahi tacos and the slow boat to china. They need to open more!!! Forever a customer! Skinny fats rules greens and proteins and that nasty protein house place suck ass."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The people are just overall great. They are welcoming, helpful, and if there is EVER a problem they will take care of it. I can't resist this place. The food is so fantastic, I hardly ever order off the set menu since they have a device on the counter with their newer creations. I love just about everything that I have tried. The only down fall (this is just my own taste buds) I don't care for the soda at this location. I am not accustom to the flavor and it didn't pull me in the fist time I tired it. Besides that I recommend this place to everyone, it is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to its reputation. Be prepared to get a menu while you wait in line so you know what you want when you get to the register...there WILL be a line. Also be prepared to throw some elbows for a place to sit. Just sit at a dirty table and they'll come over and clean it quick like! Don't worry, its so worth it. Their food is unique and tasty and will leave you wanting more."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during our class at The Range, and man was the food amazing!!! We went back for breakfast the next day. Everything was cooked just perfectly, and the healthy side food made my taste buds explode with deliciousness. And the smoothies are the perfect way to start a day."}
{"text":"Such a great find when in Vegas!  Off the strip. Great menu selection. Awesome dining and drinks."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the sweet cheeseus   Portebello, steak, cheese! Make sure you get the Charlie brownie shake too!"}
{"text":"Secret menu is to die for! All the options look delicious and are served with a smile from the staff!   We got the steak truffle fries \"happy mess\", the eggs Benedict and sweet potato pancakes! Everything was hot and delicious. The SkinnyFATS punch is a blend of fresh fruits with just enough sweetness.  The staff was very accommodating. I told them that the portion I received was smaller than I had imagined and wanted to buy another order. The instead provided me with another order free of charge. I would definitely be back if I ever venture back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Yes, Yes & Yes, super cool vibe, every city need one or two of these! The food was GREAT! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It is located in more of an industrial park type development and I wasnt expecting to see a restaurant there, but when you see it you'll know it as it is designed to attract attention! The food was delicious I got the Hot Chix which are hot wings, meat was white and flavor was great.   You have to try their jalapeño ketchup it was the bomb.  Also I got one of their fresh juice drinks which left me wanting to have 3 more! :-)"}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas for 3 years and this is by far the best breakfast i have had since moving here. All the servers are very personalable. We have had 3 different severs check to see how are food is. We will be back,  so far yummy and simple choices on the menu. I love the healthy and happy choices. This will quickly be my new fav place in Vegas. You all hit a home run."}
{"text":"Everything about SkinnyFats is great!!! Anything i order is excellent but a favorite in the Chix on Broadway"}
{"text":"I ordered lunch for a customer.  This customer had never heard of or eaten at skinny fat. I traveled from out-of-town and brought a local establishment to a current residents. Everyone loved their food. The quality was great the food was fresh and everything was very unique.   I had food delivered for five people and everyone loved their meal. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food, fairly quick. Easy location. Always seems to be busy / crowded. Love the berry the steak flatbread & all the great specials that they advertise on instagram. Warning: the soda is not traditional Coke or Pepsi, which I love in theory. It is a small brand of sodas made with real sugar. However the flavors are not great & I had a hard time finding one I enjoyed... Next time I will stick to juice, tea or water."}
{"text":"Ate here last Saturday, food was amazing. I've been a bunch but I thought it was time to leave a nice review. My fav is their Chickhumm. Can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"One very hungover morning in Vegas, I looked up juice bar on yelp, found skinnyfats and headed there immediately. It's a very cozy little place, they should really consider expanding....and adding another location in Minneapolis. Only had to wait a few minutes for my hangover remedy, which was delicious and successful. Liquid defense was also great"}
{"text":"Found this place online while in the area for business and was very pleased. Husband ordered the Healthy Side Multigrain Waffle which came with \"mint yo\" and was delicious. I ordered the Healthy Side as well, can't recall the name but it was an egg white frittata, which was also very good. We also tried the Caulifire... be prepared, it is hot but the sauce they serve with it mellows the spice and goes well with the flavor. All in all, this was a great find and we definitely will go back next time we're in Vegas. We really wish there was one of these closer to home."}
{"text":"Great experience! Healthy food like I'd make at home but sometimes you just gotta go out! The service was great, friendly and fast! The seating is not great for bigger parties but doable."}
{"text":"Love skinnyFats! Great, healthy food on the go!"}
{"text":"The service was great! Shout out to the cashier for her recommendation on the shakes, they were phenomenal. A bit pricy, but worth it. Will comeback again... Maybe..... Their ketchup is a bit different. Mixture of ketchup & jalapeños.. Yikes. Atmosphere is pretty cool, life size carrots & bananas on the walls."}
{"text":"Positive - Amazing food! Try the Flat Chix and Greens. Good cookies, too. Fun atmosphere.   Negative - Small space/cramped. Long lines."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way out of Vegas and it did not disappoint! The menu is really clever, giving you healthy options and happy options both each subcategory, and the food was solid. I ordered the Filet o Fire (happy side) and it had lots of flavor and was cooked perfectly. I was with a 3 others and they all raved about their food."}
{"text":"I love this place! First time going and planning on going back soon I hope. There was 7 of us but we managed to find tables next to each other. The cashier young lady was so sweet and nice, actually the whole staff was nice. The food for was healthy and delicious. Please please come to Whittier, California!!!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with their fresh pressed juices and ahi tacos. Reasonably priced, good quality is beyond adequate. Perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Only reservation is the size for seating. Otherwise, menu has a phenom concept."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere - good music playing at just the right volume; funky, hip, pop-art style decor; bohemian/rustic furnishings and fixtures.  It wasn't what we expected after others called it \"hipster.\"  The staff was smiling, courteous, and knowledgable.  Chicky behind the counter knew the menu and offered suggestions. The selections are varied and unique, with choices for those who are health conscious and choices for those who've already met their soul mates.   The food arrived promptly and exactly as ordered.  I had the Chickhumm with fries and a side salad. The Chickhumm was a large portion, with über-fresh toppings and a super soft bun.  The fries were stiff and seemed saturated with grease - slightly unpleasant but edible.  The salad was ultra-crisp, like freshly ironed sheets! And the fat-free ranch was tangy and thick.  A steady stream of incoming patrons reassured us that we'd made the right choice for dinner.  And at just over $30 for two people, it proved to be a tasty bargain.  Overall, a very enjoyable experience at SkinnyFats.  I'm certain we will return again."}
{"text":"If I want a well done burger give me a well done burger! When I ordered a burger well done the female cashier had a grin on her face and told me the well done burgers don't taste good here so I should order it medium or medium well. I took her suggestion and ordered it medium well and sure enough I get a bloody red undercooked burger. I should have read Yelp reviews before I came here because other people are having similar issues."}
{"text":"Awkward flavor combinations but oh so fresh and lots of healthy selection, if they had more tables I'd eat here everyday."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Super fun lunch spot, great menu, good prices, a good variety of portion sizes, and fantastic flavors. I ordered two smaller things from the healthy side -- a tuna taco and the buffalo cauliflower. My husband ordered a chicken sandwich from the healthy side. Though we loved all of it, there is absolutely no way (unless they have the most talented and magical chef ever to walk the Earth) that the things we ordered were remotely healthy. Maybe they're healthier than items from the \"happy side\" but most of the \"healthy items\" come with creamy, mayo-type sauces and drizzles and oil-based dressings. Delicious? Yes! Healthy? Wish it were."}
{"text":"Great idea. Well executed dishes. Patio is shaded and has plenty of room. I was hooked the first time. Everything is delicious. Truffle fries wow. Try something different every time. It's just one of those places."}
{"text":"If you enjoy good food then this place is for you! I am yet to try something on the menu that I don't like. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Delicious! It's better than some places on the Vegas strip. The location off of Dean Martin is a hole in the wall in a professional/industrial looking strip mall. We had the Chickawaffadopolis and poached eggs with coconut shrimp on rice, both were good. But if we had to choose, the fried chicken tenders and buttermilk waffle were the better of the two dishes. The waffle was light and fluffy and the chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside."}
{"text":"I'll give this place 5 stars. I dig the decor it's very colorful and cozy. Lots of artwork on the walls and bright colors. Its small and i heard its crazy during lunch hour, etc with lines going outside the door.The menu is pretty simple...healthy or happy side.  I wanted to try everything but I ordered Smoke in a Bowl. It was really good and healthy. My company ordered Drunken Gypsy Toast.  I'm ordering that next time I go there :) This isn't a cheap place but you pay for what you get. The portions could be for 2 people, its a lot of food so it's worth it.  It's pretty cold in the restaurant and that would be the only downfall that I've noticed.  The staff is really friendly and helpful. I will definitely recommend this spot to my friends and I'll be returning over and over again."}
{"text":"Such a great place! I had never been here before and Jordan took the time to go through the menu and give recommendations. He did not disappoint! This is a great place to eat if you want affordable great tasting food that is also healthy."}
{"text":"Im excited to have you guys closer to my house and i love your food and smoothies but today i went in and got 3 smooth immunity and a naked chix. I found it weird that i wasnt asked if i wanted soy milk or 2% milk pr ice cream or frozen yogurt , so by the time i made it to freeway rushing to go to work i was drinking my smoothie and it was not the loght orange color and it was too sour to even drink and my kids couldnt even drink them. Dont get me wrong i understand reciepes change and training new ppl is hard but consistency is important ."}
{"text":"This place is great. Give it a try. Had the blt. Everthing fresh. Has a Santa Cruz feel on the inside"}
{"text":"food was fine..  service was good.  nice selection on menu"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The service is great and food is amazing!:) I been coming here for a long time and the one time  they didn't get my order correct, they fixed it quickly with no issue. Plus I got a free side. Wonderful service!"}
{"text":"This place was really fun and the food was fantastic. Make sure you try the balls and the waffle"}
{"text":"The truffle fries are to die for! This location is much bigger than the one on Dean Martin! Thank god it's so much closer to me now!"}
{"text":"I like trying new breakfast places and I found Skinnyfats in a magazine. I was highly disappointed because the eggs came so under cooked they where like water on a plate, no condiments on the table you have to ask and when they bring you salt it comes in a little plastic cup. If you have ever tried to shake salt out of a cup you know that you only get sporadic clumps so that one bit has to much salt and then your next bit has none. It wasn't even salt for food it was pretzel salt like salt rocks and if you have never used this on your food trust me it ruins any meal. My bread was burned and so hard I could not eat it. I ordered a drink with my meal but they forgot it and I had to ask twice for my drink, they final brought it when I was ready to leave. I also had to ask multiple times for napkins. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great breakfast in Vegas! Love eating locally. Loved that they had the calories listed. Just wished they had eggs and toast on the menu. Will go back when in town!"}
{"text":"I must say this place is gnarly awesome! The teriahi was supreme and the smooth immunity was everything my body needed to recover from my wicked week of surfing the blue crush in Venice. But that's besides the point, this joint took me in like one of their own posse, they greeted me with a smile, and handled my order like a real bro would, and I appreciate that. So yeah, thanks for the stellar time skinnyFats! Oh, and Sienna, was super awssome! Thanks for the dank service!"}
{"text":"I got the slow boat to China and it was everything I wanted. It was a bit crowded and ordering your food takes awhile. The owner may need to consider expanding the restaurant. I went with my family and it was 5 of us. We were a bit cramped but we sucked it up. Everyone was happy with their food. The menu was a little confusing and most of the people in line to order took forever. I think it's just a bit overwhelming with everyone in their and the menu is hard to read. All in all the food we ate was good. The cucumber juice was a but much and a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Such a cute, welcoming place :) loved the food and the service, very nice and friendly. It was a rainy day and the place was really busy, but we didnt have to wait too long for our order. I'm glad i found this place :)"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite spots to eat at in Vegas. I work nearby so I frequently stop in as much as 3 times a week.   The food is great and the service is extraordinary. My only complaint is it is sometimes hard to find a seat because its so busy, and I end up having to take my meal to go and eat at work.   I would love to see them expand the space or add outdoor seating somehow."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but definitely not worth the lack of seating and the poor staff performance on a Saturday night. Orders arriving incorrect, and parties of two taking up tables that could be used by parties of three or more."}
{"text":"First visit today and was so impressed. Their Healthy/Happy menu concept is brilliant with choices for everyone. We had hot chix salad (happy) loaded with blue cheese,  buffalo fried chicken and deep fried jalapeños. From the healthy side, Caulifire with yogurt dip, Ahi Sriracha taco, sweet,  spicy, crunchy,  large taco and Shrimp in a boat, cucumber filled with a spicy Pico and topped with shrimp.  So many more things to try, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for a while and happy I did. I would have rated it a 5 but I have only visited it one time so far. Excited to try the juices when I am doing my once a month juice \"cleanse\". Great vibe, great service and great food. I plan on being a regular!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit we got the wrap supastar, the cinnutella and the charlie brownie.  There was only a little bit of egg white on one side of the burrito and it was overload spicy.  There was no nutella in the nutella shake the strawberries overpowered the other flavors. And the cinnutella also had no nutella they put chocolate with it instead. And it just tasted like eating a pile of fried sugar. Way too much sugar. I also got coffee and they were ever stingy with the sugar and creamer.  Overall not bad but not worth the price and if a food item is going to advertize a certain brand food then they should put that brand food in the meal."}
{"text":"Just moved to Las Vegas and found this place on Yelp. The selection of food is excellent, and the quality is superb. I will never again be hungover without one of their  hangover juice remedies. The Acai with granola and fruit is also fantastic. I have never left a review but felt it was my duty after so many enjoyable meals from here. I always get delivery and they do add a charge so be aware. A nice mix and healthy and not so healthy food so a group of people can agree on one restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing! Vegwich is a great vegetarian option! Already looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and the bussers were friendly. The problem was the female cashier had attitude and tried to upgrade me on everything! Drinks to Cheese sauce.  Then claimed that I spilled on the floor, I am a customer, cashier needs better customer service. Gave the busser extra top bc they at least had customer service."}
{"text":"Omg the wake and bacon is just amazing! It's been two days since I've had it and it's all I've been thinking about. The girls working there are just so nice. Haven't had customer service like that in a while. I'll be back when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Staying in the strip and being from Australia this place was a gold mine in our eyes. Great service great food and the coffee was good. I want to take one to Australia such a great idea on the menu."}
{"text":"I love their very delicious and creative menu.  Staff is always upbeat and friendly.  Sometimes I wish their place was bigger though, gets a little crowded.  I love getting the Teri ahi sandwich and the truffle fries!"}
{"text":"Delicious, gorgeous, and oh so satisfying. We had a quick lunch here when in Vegas this summer and ordered The Classic (medium rare and juicy), a side of truffle fries (comes with The Classic), and the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis (fried chicken breast strips over buttermilk waffles and syrup).   Truffle Fries: The fries are regular shoe-string style and fresh, with lightly sprinkled truffle and cheese. It was slightly under seasoned, but the truffle scent and taste really shined. Delicious by its own merit or with a quick visit to the ketchup pond.  The Classic burger: The fresh bun is dwarfed by the amount of veggies, thick tomato slices, and enormous juicy patty; if you're a messy eater, grab a few napkins before you start. It was a perfect combination of healthy veggies and the gluttony of burger meat...  Chick-a-waff-a-dopolis: A few reviews mentioned that this was a \"secret\" menu item, but I saw it on the menu like anything else. Thick cuts of delicious chicken breast dipped and fried in an amazing batter. The chicken was well seasoned and had a kick of flavor. The waffles and syrup was great, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Overall, SkinnyFATS is a great escape from the binge eating habits most tourists experience on the Strip. It doesn't aim to be more than it is -- the perfect place for lunch.  PROTIP: They have on site wifi and USB charging!"}
{"text":"All I can say is Fantastic! I will be back every time I'm in Vegas! I don't review often, but this place got me to review because how amazing it was. Employees were great, service was outstanding and the food was wonderful. I could eat there every day.  I would recommend the burgers and shakes."}
{"text":"While visiting my cousin in Las Vegas, she suggested this place for the gluten free options. The place was really busy. Food was excellent.  I loved the options of the different pure came sodas. The reason for the two stars was the timing of the food. We both ordered off the healthy menu and my boyfriend ordered off the happy side. My cousin and I got our food almost 10 minutes before my boyfriends came out. We were also missing half of our order. I will be back for sure. Just think they need to work on their time of food and bring it all out together."}
{"text":"First and only visit!!! I really wanted to like this place because I heard friends rave about it. So I figured I'd go big or go home and ordered a S'motherload burrito. As I cut into it and go to take my 2nd bite, I look down at the hair wrapped up in the middle of the \"motherload\"..now things like this make my stomach queasy so I just flagged down an employee and explained why I would not be finishing my food. She offered me a new one, but I just had to decline. I don't plan to make another visit ever again."}
{"text":"Excellent in every way. Healthy or not so much. Amazing combos of flavors.  Great menu. Seriously, eat here."}
{"text":"Great food combined with a hip environment. Perhaps a tad bit overpriced but I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out because of all the hype and was kinda disappointed. First off the servings are pretty small according to their price, but I thought eh that's all \"healthy\" food joints. I got the chicken and waffles the healthy version, and the \"nutella\" shake that tasted nothing like nutella lol. Anyways, it was all okay, tasted good, but just not filling enough.  The worst part was that I went with my brother and his gf and we all got different things but each a shake and the next day we were all in the bathroom to say the least. I'm assuming it was old milk or something because that was the only thing we all got and we were all sick the next day. Not worth returning."}
{"text":"Great place for food. A lot of different variety! Just lately for me it hasn't been the same as I keep on going there time after time. As if it's becoming an old thing for me."}
{"text":"Really good LOCAL food! I haven't been to the new location but I've been going to the original location pretty much since they opened. The menu has changed a few times since then but there are still a lot of really great options. Definitely a good variety of food and the fact that breakfast is served all day is a plus! Love the idea of their happy/healthy menu options. Keep a look out for the weekly specials! And I would recommend downloading their app for access to the secret menu options...if you don't know, now you know!"}
{"text":"I give them an A for originality. My wife really enjoyed the roasted veggy sandwich.  My experience was a bit different. We sat outside and our table was sticky. When my burger came it was mostly cold and so were the fries. They politely replaced the fries, I didn't mention the burger.  Anyway I'm giving them three stars because my wife was happy.  I will give them another try at a later date - hopefully it will be better (for me)."}
{"text":"I am giving 3 stars for one single reason:  Lack of fresh ingredients  This simple change could take this small establishment and make it live up to the hype that has surrounded it.  Here are some examples from the food I ate:  Chicken - looked like precooked and sliced packaged chicken slices Fruit - definitely mass packaged precut fruit French fries/ sweet potato fries - frozen  The restaurant is a bit misleading with the decor and catering to a health conscious crowd. It has a lot of potential by simply changing this small aspect. Short cuts are not flattering at boutique establishments."}
{"text":"This place was great. I saw the pictures of the meals on a friend's facebook page and had to try it. Not only was the food amazing, but the girls there had so much personality I felt like I was visiting family. Good service is so hard to find now a days. Based on my friend's pictures I was not aware they had healthy alternatives as well, so you can bring your healthy friends and family with you too. Highly recommend for good service, great food, and selection. Small place though so if you go on a weekend be ready to wait."}
{"text":"The absolute best place to eat. So full of flavors, imagination and just plain goodness. If they really open on No Decatur they will be slammed all the time. Would be the only decent restaurant in that area."}
{"text":"Had this for breakfast and was it yummy! I was skeptic at first because it had waffles, jalapeños, and steak. But it was really good paired with there chipotle sauce."}
{"text":"The food is good but they NEVER get an order correct for me.Previously they always forget something on my order and I catch it, but I had ordered a \"Sweet Cheese Us\" through their delivery app and asked for extra cheese sauce in addition to the cheese sauce the are supposed to give with the sandwich. Instead I got no sauce. ZERO. Which is ridiculous seeing that I even asked for extra and it was on the receipt. My boyfriend also ordered friend pickles and received no sauce either.The staff needs to get it together and make sure orders are complete. I'm just sick of looking forward to my meal and always being disappointed when something is missing. Safe to say I won't be eating here anymore."}
{"text":"Ordered the G. O. A. T. salad. When asked how I wanted the filet mignon cooked, I said medium rare. When I got the salad and *tried* to eat it, the steak was literally so overcooked it was like chewing gum. I could barely cut through it, let alone chew it. So I took it back in and asked if they could make it again with the steak even more rare. I got my order again within record time with what I'm pretty sure had to be the same steak I just gave back to them (only less of it, since some I had started to cut up), and probably just as overcooked, or even less rare than last time, and closer to well done (no pink or red area in the middle at all). This is by far not a 4.5-star steak salad by any stretch.  The service and courtesy of the staff were fine, and everything else about the establishment seemed pretty high quality. But I could cook a steak better in my sleep than these guys could. Waste of $12 bucks. I ended up only eating the rest of the salad as I didn't want to bother going back in again to let the cook know he had no idea how to cook a filet mignon.  Bottom line: if you're going to bother asking people how they want their steak cooked, know how to do it right. Otherwise, you're just setting the customer up for disappointment. And this was not only a disappointment, but an embarrassment when I went in to ask for it to be done right, only to get the order again just as bad or worse than it was the first time.  Edit: the manager replied to my review and apologized, and offered me a generous credit for the next time I happen to be in the area. So they get credit for wanting to make things right, and striving to improve in areas where needed. 3 stars for taking the time to provide above-average customer service."}
{"text":"Tried this place cuz of all the great reviews but was really disappointed what I had specifically ordered- arrabiata flatbread pizza and tuna bowl. Food tasted mediocre at best. Likely will not return."}
{"text":"As a long time customer, I'm disappointed in the recent menu change, and every time I've been in there since I've notice other customers experiencing my same frustration.  Items cut from menu no longer able to order, even if you ask. Less flatbread pizza choices.  Sandwiches have less on them, now dry... less cranberry sauce on the Cranburkey, less hummus now made of beets (?!) on the Chickhumm.  Flat Chix, Hot Chix, and Wake N' Bacon are still good. Cookies and juices are great. Employees have always been incredible nice.   I'm sad with menu change, maybe there will be better menu changes in the future based on customer response, but if you're here for the first time this is a healthy and unique dining spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time while I was in town on vacation. I can't think of a better place to get some food to help recover from the previous night. Excellent food and customer service"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. My only complaint about this place has nothing to do with the food. This establishment painfully attempts to force a 'hip' ambiance onto its customers via an unconvincingly coerced, pseudo-trendy environment that only exists to insist upon itself. Other than that, the food is terrific.   A+ food. Keep it up. D- attempt at being hip or trendy. Try less, please."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times now, and WOW. Always an enthusiastic welcome from all staff and the food is excellent. Everything is made to order & selection is awesome. Very hip interior, especially for a quick bites place. Definitely a new favorite."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is unique and the food names are cute. The Tacos are yummy. The buff chix is delicious. The cookies are the best."}
{"text":"Noticed this place looking for a quick bite to eat. I was amazed with the menu being that I am a vegeterian. I had the potato balls ( awesome) and the buffalo cauliflower. Great atomposhere, good customer service and the staff was very friendly. Love the energy. Late review. I went yesterday around 2pm. I think the gentleman who helped us was Brian. Not sure but he was very nice and informative."}
{"text":"If you walk in and there is a long line-don't freak out, it goes by really fast and worth the wait.  I had the Ahi sandwich and truffle fries. Sooooo good.  Can't wait to go back and try the breakfast smoothies!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Prices are great! I appreciate the original ambiance!  ... \"I'll be back\"-Arnold S.  #loveskinnyfats #livehealthylivehappy BW"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. It's located off of the strip and has plenty of parking. Small location so be prepared to Wait for a table if you go at peak times. Menu has many options and has great juice selections also. Service was great and staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing! Something for everyone, Healthy or Indulgent. I can only think of one negative thing to say, NEED MORE SPACE! This place is going to do great and will be busy.  Finally a awesome place to eat in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Inventive health bites . I spent less than other protein places . The location is an industrial plaza and hopefully they will relocation to a real location venue site . But until then there are tons of hot locals getting good grub here ."}
{"text":"This place is great! A lot smaller than I anticipated because of all the great reviews but I still loved it! A very clean place to eat. Ordering was easy and everyone there is super nice! Food was well prepared and put together. Just tell them that you have never been there before and they will explain everything to you! Definitely coming back whenever I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Do not go here if you have allergies and expect to be taken seriously! I specifically stated I am ALLERGIC to gluten and made my usual order which they have always been able to substitute for me. The staff was very helpful and seemed to be carefully understanding my requests. The chef on the other hand, not so much. The server brought out our food and announced 'gluten free' when he set it down. The only reason I noticed it wasn't right is when I requested a side of the sauce they don't use on the dish to make it gluten free (my partner does not have a gluten allergy) it was a very different color from what it has been in the past. It didn't register until after I took a bite of the food and tasted so different from how I remembered. I then decided to ask what was going on with this 'gluten free' dish and come to find out they did not use the correct sauce and I was poisoned. Our meal and our time here was ruined. As much as I love this place for trying to offer gluten free options I will not be dining here any longer. The worst part is I was told a manager would be getting in touch with me and no one ever followed up with me. It has been several weeks since the incident and I'm still sick."}
{"text":"This place was 5 stars all the way about 12 months ago. I hate when you watch the demise of restaurants. Food quality/preparation has declined steadily. Side note: if you're going to have a mirror that shines down on the inside of your expo counter from the ceiling, you should consider that counter to be a display. Sani bucket on the counter next to ready to eat food, water was brown and had a brown towel in it...nasty"}
{"text":"Love, love love!!!  The arugula chicken plate is delicious and healthy.  Service is good and menu has lots of choices."}
{"text":"I felt like I was whisked away to San Francisco or San Diego when I stepped foot in here. The line was nearly out the door for lunch but it moved quickly. I took my order to go afraid I wouldn't find an open spot, but tables did turn over quickly too. I love the concept happy and healthy, it ought to please everyone. I opted to stay on the healthy side TBLT with sweet potato fries. The sandwich packed a lot of flavor and it was quite good. I'd definitely get it again. They also make a tasty sweet potato fry. The were a bit limp by the time I got them back to the office so next time I'd like to try them fresh. I'll take my chances and dine in."}
{"text":"My past experiences dining at SkinnyFATS, have been great until yesterday 1/25/16 . My husband and I went there for The Green Mile Juice (love, order when we eat there) at 9:00 am. I waited in the car while he ordered my drink.  My husband ordered The Green MILE with NO APPLE because I'm highly allergic to fruit (hospitalized twice). He told the girl taking his order I have a apple allergy.  Since, there is no other fruit listed in the drink, he did not give her a list of all of the fruits I am allergic to. He gave me the drink, but as soon as I took a sip I knew there was fruit in it. He took it back and explained my fruit allergies to the girl taking the order again.  The girl who made my drink came out of the back and took it upon herself state, \"There's no apple in it. I'm a culinary genius, I put in oranges and syrup in it.\" Then, I went into the restaurant and explained, again, that I am allergic to fruit. She just gave me a blank stair and said, \"So you want only vegetables?\" I replied, \"That's what I ordered, right?\"  Ultimately, the manager refunded our purchase and the drink was made correctly.  Every other time I ordered this drink, it was made without fruit.  Thankfully, I did not have an allergic reaction from taking a sip of the drink. People with food allergies know how serious an issue this could have been.  Employees in the food industry need to pay more attention to these issues and not change menu items on a whim. We enjoy eating here and are happy that steps were made to correct this issue. Hopefully, this will bring more awareness to food owners so they can address the importance of food allergies with staff."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great friendly service,  clean and fun atmosphere...Two thumbs up!!! Had the Steak Eyes (fried steak with biscuits & gravy) it was delicious. Husband and I shared the French toast with Nutella, it was simply decadent. We'll definitely come back when we stay in Vegas next time...I wish we had a SkinnyFAT near home."}
{"text":"Really good selections for Vegetarians! A lot of items did revolve around meat but there were more options for veg and even vegans than I would've expected! I ordered the Zucc It and a green juice. Zucc It is a zucchini noodle pasta. Arrived at our table quickly and was piping hot. Very well seasoned and tasty! Would definetly go back."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Got the burger medium rare, and it actually came out medium rare. We all know how no matter how you order a burger at most places they still come out very well done. Had sweet potatoes as a side, some of the best I ever had! Customer service was unlike any other food place in Vegas! They went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect. Cost of food was a little high than your average burger joint, but that's  due to the quality of the food. I would come here again without question!  Oh and the place is a bit hard to find, no light up signs. Just trust Google maps and keep your eye out for it."}
{"text":"First off if your friend tells you it's good and you have kids don't bother. Small, not a place for kids, and it's the kind of place were the staff puts knifes in front of toddlers along with hot coffee. Food sounded great and it was as long as you ordered something that is fresh made. Avoid #merica.  It looked good for 10$ yet the meat is dry, the biscuits were harder than the chairs.  No amount of chulala hot sauce could save it. For four people was about 50$. Between the off the beaten path trendiness of the place I would have rather gone to ihop."}
{"text":"I had a mouth watering Sweet Cheese Us from the Fats menu, it was seasoned just right and the mushrooms were cooked to perfection! Skinny Fats is definitely on my permanent list of things to do while in Vegas! I'm hoping they open one in San Diego soon but until then I have my Salt Man Pepper Pants (salt shaker purchased at Skinny Fats) to remind me of their great food!"}
{"text":"I came in for the very first time just a few days ago. Huge shout out to MARC because he really helped me out on deciding what to order and his customer service skills are on point.  Definitely one of the best food places I've visited in a really long time; that's all I gotta say."}
{"text":"The location will throw you off. It is surrounded by businesses and a couple of strip clubs along the way.  It is located on Dean Martin and Post, to be exact, so no one will get lost. The decor of the place, once you find it is a nice combination of modern and old. The food is delicious and the servers are very attentive. The tacos are delightful and the burgers are very good. The cranberry burger, I know sounds different, is very tasty. There is a great sweet taste from the cranberry and the saltiness of the meat makes it a perfect synthesis. The main problem with the place is the space. Lunch time and dinner time, the place becomes filled to the brink. Make sure that you come along before the rush hour, be warned."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. My friend, a fellow Elite member, brought me here. She's also previously brought many out-of-towners here. We came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. There was a line out the door. I had high hopes. I loved the concept of the healthy and junk menus. Something for everyone.  I ordered a Chix on Broadway. My friend ordered the Cherry Popper.  20 minutes later, the place had pretty much cleared out when the manager (I assume) asked us what we ordered. We told him and I heard him call to the back to \"fire up a Chix.\" He returned with my friend's food and said my food would arrive shortly. Her food was cold, so she sent it back. They immediately gave her another one (we assumed it was made for someone else). It took a total of 25 minutes for her to get her food and her truffle fries contained no truffle flavor. It took a full 32 minutes from time of order to get my meal. The \"manager\" apologized, but didn't offer an explanation. I wish I hadn't pre-tipped. The food itself was nothing special. Not worth the wait time."}
{"text":"I came here last night for diner, and the food was excellent. The atmosphere was good. It tends to get really busy, witch I think is a good thing.  The only reason why I am giving it a four stars is: because they don't have a lot of tables to seat at and we had to wait to sit down."}
{"text":"I love skinny fats!   I have been to both locations several times and I am just never disappointed. The only reason I gave this four stars is because my order did get messed up once but the customer service was so great.   I remember Tiana because she helped me fix my messed up order. I've also seen her at both locations and she is so nice and gave me a great recommendation to try. There was also a new worker, drew ( I think), who was so personable and made sure I had everything correct.   At the dean Martin location, there was a girl named jackie, she was so sweet and just made my lunch break so much better.   I usually get the naked chic with no cilantro yo and a drink depending how I'm feeling and on special days a cookie! Definitely loveeee the sweet potato fries for sure and the burgers are always a great choice!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not great either.  Healthy. Very small and plain."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! Food is healthy and service is fast! Definitely can't go wrong coming to this here! Also, their house coffee is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great smiles and customer service. The atmosphere is like an indoor picnic. Check them out"}
{"text":"Awesome little place away from the strip. The Ahi Srirachi is absolutely amazing. Super fresh. Love this place already."}
{"text":"A newly opened establishment that has creating buzz around town for its fresh and healthy meals. There is a breakfast menu, served all day in addition to their entrees items for lunch and dinner.  You would have to use your phone to map this place out because it is on Dean Martin Drive in a business building plaza, not your typical location for a restaurant.  There are a lot of menu options, it is hard to pick just one to try for your first time. I ordered the Chix on Broadway, a breaded chicken sandwich with bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, and lemon aioli. Your side options include truffle fries, sweet potato fries, or healthier options of fruit, brown rice, and salad. I chose the truffle fries, and they are delicious. I could taste every ingredient in the sandwich, including the lemon aioli that was subtle yet added to the flavor. Chix on Broadway was made well and all the ingredients complemented each other.  For a somewhat fast food restaurant, the wait was 15 minutes for my food to cook. This is only because it's cooked to order from fresh ingredients, making it worth the wait.  I was genuinely pleased with my  first visit, I would come back to try something else new on the menu at this creative American restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place. I eat here at least once a week if not more. It has a diverse menu and many delicious options and upgrades. The smoothies are delicious. I usually get \"Chix on Broadway\" , \"buff chix\", or \"chikhumm\". All delicious! The ambiance is amazing and the decor is so cute. They always play good music. Definitely a fun spot"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here. Super fun and modern feel. I think they have a great set up, just a bit of a difficult location to get to from the rest of the town.   The food was ok. Nothing too special tasting but very creative. I will say that the burgers looked great and I think next time I will have to try one."}
{"text":"This was a great place to pick up some food in our drive back. Smoothies and juices were great and the breakfast sandwich was filling!"}
{"text":"Haven't ever given a 5 star rating but this place is amazing. Everything from the decor, creative menu, speed from ordering to on the table.. This place need to be a bit bigger (i hear its always pretty packed) but I got a table so what do i care? Haha went with a friend and shared:  The cran-turkey and side of fruit - served on a yummy grain roll, the patty is speckled with cranberries and also has a cranberry yogurt spread, so fresh and delicious  Tu-nuts- Any sushi place serving a dish piled with THIS much tuna would be $25, and here its just over $6!!! they really pile on the tuna. I normally dont care much for raw seafood but this was amazing, served on a bed of crunchy asian slaw and hollowed out cucumber, personally a better way to eat fish if you're craving sushi, the rice always leaves me with a bellyache. This is perfection.  Hot-mame- sweet and spicy, great sized portion.   Beet juice, and a tea.. My friend got the beet juice, and said it was amazing. I got the black tea with lemon and sipped on it all day. They're served in awesome reusable branded cups with little smiley faces that fade into sad faces as you drink more of your beverage. both my friend and I thought that was adorable.  I LOVE THIS PLACE. BEEN WAITING FOR HEALTHY FOOD TO BE DONE CREATIVELY AND 'RIGHT' HERE IN VEGAS. I live far, on N Durango but will make this a weekly habit, for sure :]"}
{"text":"this is one of the coolest place on the South West side of town. consistently great food, staff, and environment. the skinny side of the menu is equally as good as the fat side. definitely love this location."}
{"text":"I really love the concept of skinny fats. There are hardly any restaurants in Las Vegas that offer gluten free and vegan options so when this opened I was sure to check it out! I love that they give you reusable, recyclable cups for juice drinks and smoothies and I think their juice tastes awesome! Their food didn't blow me away but I do like their gluten free pizza. Service is friendly!  This place gets really busy right around lunch time, so get there early if you don't want to wait or are in a rush.  On the pricey side!"}
{"text":"This is going to be one of my very favorite places to visit! The quinoa &chickpea vegetable soup has to be the best soup around town. The spicy chix salad was fantastic. It's a very busy place, but you don't wait long for your food! Can't wait for Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"They have a healthy (skinny) side and a non healthy (fats) side of the menu. So little for everyone. They have inside and outside seating. Only downfall is the seating areas are small. So if it's a busy day might be hard getting a table. People are nice here. I usually come for the breakfast but lunch options are good too"}
{"text":"Very cool interior! Food delicious!! Excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Super yummy breakfast for a family of 8!  Nice to have a healthy side and a more indulgent side of the menu. Chicken & waffles was amazing and everyone loved the avocado toast. Awesome kids smaller options."}
{"text":"One of the most delicious burgers I've ever had. And let me tell you, I've had my share of ground beef. The food was amazing, but the staff is what really made this place memorable. We showed up within a minute of closing time and they still happily took our order and let us take our time eating. Sorry for being that annoying customer, but I do sincerely appreciate it."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Service 5 Food 5 Atmosphere 5 Value 5 What stands out- Healthy food that really tastes great. The slow boat to china, nice to greek you flat bread, chicken sandwich, homemade cookies served warm and complimentary water with cucumbers and lemons.  Cant wait to try breakfast."}
{"text":"What a terrific find!  Out of nowhere, this place is a hip/retro burger joint that serves up mean salads, smoothies and treats.  Ordered the fillet goat cheese salad and it was divine! Steak was cooked medium rare - to a tee. The frites were really good also.  I went out on a limb and ordered the cucumber smoothie. It was good, but not something I'd order again... but then again, how good can you make a cucumber smoothie...?  :)  Looking forward to trying other items on the menu during my next visit!"}
{"text":"Really, really good food. The cauliFIRE was a great combo and the sweet potato fries were some of the best I've ever had. Would definitely recommend the Zucc it. All around great place and healthy too!"}
{"text":"FonZ n Bianca rocked! Food was awesome. Gotta go! Kitchen only got empty plates back."}
{"text":"Everyone I know talks so much about this place.....I went for the first time and I don't know why it's so good to people. The place is hard to find, parking is difficult and it's just overcrowded with no where to walk inside. This place has a unique setting and their menu is different from most burger places, but the food, it isn't special to me. I tried so many dishes and I was they weren't bad but nothing stood out to me. I don't think I will be coming back. The burgers, no matter how many different combinations they have, they all seem to taste the same to me. The Kalefornia salad was supposed to have dressing in it but the kale wasn't moist with any dressing at all. The Orange You Happy Float was not delicious either. My experience here just was not satisfying my taste buds and I don't know why people like it."}
{"text":"Brussel Crowe was well done. Great menu selections (including the fountain drinks - not your ordinary colas), and great vibe."}
{"text":"If this place were any more hipster, it would just burst!  Every aspect of what's going on here is hip. The location is a bit tricky in the dark--they are indeed in a squat little one-story business park building. Although the map shows it close to the strip, it looks like it would be a tricky walk (me and the trusty Chrysler 200 rental drove over). The decor is wood panels with cool paintings. There is a TV--tuned to college hoops on my visit. The staff is super-friendly and helpful. The milkshake cup is reusable as well as compostable and covered with witty witty sayings. I had the Sweet and Spicy with milk and fro yo. It was as advertised--the spicy being mostly a ginger flavor. My gluten free pizza food was wonderful. It had steak and enough greens on top to be a salad. I probably over-ordered, since this was a lot of food for me. (Maybe sharing the shake or the pizza would be better!) As for cost, well, you get what you pay for. The dish I ordered had many ingredients and all were fresh and high quality. They tasted like they were made there and not unloaded off of some truck in a freezer bag. This costs money. And I saw it in the food. I will stop back next time I'm in town. They do carry out, which looks like a good idea since the seating is limited and will likely max out at lunch time. Great job!"}
{"text":"Their look, their attitude, this place is really unique. Not to mention the food and juices are really good. You even have a view of airplanes taking off and landing if you sit at the bar. They also have a a healthy menu, and a not so healthy menu, which is fun. Everything I've had on their menu is good, so try it all!"}
{"text":"Found out about skinny fats through yelp after my last stay in Vegas, but I never got a chance to actually go. This Super Bowl weekend, that all changed. My buddies were very hesitant to actually try the place. If you're with a bunch of friends, you know it's hard to find a place for all to agree on after a long night out in Vegas. The options on where to eat is endless. Lucky enough, skinny fats has it all for any picky eater, so there's something for everyone.   The location is somewhat misplaced, but it is where it is, I suppose.   Now, the food is where it is at. I ordered the burger Benedict on menu. Let me say, the burger was fantastic and I enjoyed every bite. Also, I went with the sweet potato fries. I never had sweet potato fries, and they were good. Unfortunately, there were so many on the plate and couldn't finish them all. My buddies ordered there dishes and enjoyed there meals too. My buddies all have different diets. Ones a fitness fanatic, and the rest are just big portion eaters. They all got what they wanted and were happy at the end.   All in all, five stars for this establishment in my book and my friends books too."}
{"text":"Super cool place.  A little hard to get to/find, but once you do it's great.  The place is super small inside and probably can only seat like 30 people or so, so be prepared to wait a bit, but it's worth it.    The place is very LA style.  Trying to be grudge, but great food quality and menu options for healthy or a little sinful.    Prices were very fair, especially for the quality.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"In town for a convention, but don't want to eat on the strip.  This place rocks.  Came here for breakfast two days and want disappointed.  Substituted tuna for the filet mignon on the cluck moo , Cinnutella was incredible. Wake n  bake and  fresh morning were delicious and huge. Wish I would have found this sooner in the Vaca"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and helpful.  I ordered two ahi tuna tacos - one from the skinny side, the other from the fun side.  Both were delicious.  The truffle fries came out late and had zero truffle flavor.  Lemon blueberry cookie was a bit overpriced but so yummy."}
{"text":"Absolute bomb. I eat nutella 3 meals a day so jumped right to their FAT nutella French toast. Light crisp to the toast with cinnamon and sugar...brought me back to my childhood dreams of school lunch French toast sticks, loved them. Ask other plates at my table that were ordered were awesome too. Must go to place for sure."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast off the strip. Hidden location in a commercial area, but worth the find. The shakes are great, and the waffles while healthy and low calorie are very good."}
{"text":"So, based on a recommendation from a family member i gave this place a try. Let me tell you the service, staff, and quality of food is top notch. The food flavor is good and the facility was clean. I would recommend anyone to come here as they offer vegetarian and non-vegetarian food as well. Both items from the menu is good and you will not be disapointed."}
{"text":"Had the brioche French toast and the cherry bomb. Not by myself.. Was delicious. Definitely coming back! Need a location near the east side!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants. The staff is always friendly and helpful. My favorite meal is the Ahi Taco San. The portions are large and the food is always fresh. They seem to use pretty good quality ingredients although I would like to see some all natural hormone and antibiotic free options. I like to try something different each time and I can honestly say I have never had anything I didn't like. The location is a little off the beaten path but it is closer to my house than the Durango location. This location doesn't have as nice of an outdoor seating area and did not serve alcohol but it wasn't a big deal to me."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining! Loved everything about the place.  We went around 9:30am on a Sunday and although the place is small, we had no problem finding a seat and the hard part was deciding which delicious offering to get. Prices were very reasonable considering the huge potion size and quality.  Wish they were in the Indianapolis area so we could try everything on the menu.  Will definitely pass the word. Loved it!"}
{"text":"The food and options are amazing!! 4 stars instead of 5 only because finding parking is near impossible and seating is tight inside the cafe.  However the quality of food and ambiance are way above average!!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo YUMMY! And great service!!!! Fonz helped us out and she's also, like super pretty. Wish they had one in Scottsdale, Arizona, it would do SO well!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Interesting location... though I guess there's only so much room in the strip part of Vegas.  While good, I'll leave it there.  I ordered the wake n bacon and a black cherry soda. I'd say the soda was the star.  The wake n bacon was pretty good - kind of dry. I did like the sriracha cream cheese when it popped up. Avocados were fresh.  It's a very small shop with limited seating- hopefully they can buy one of the side businesses to expand.  I love all the names though and the balance of a healthy/not as healthy menu! They call one side of the menu healthy and the other side happy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I moved here from San Francisco and this almost reminds me of something you would find in SF.  The food is great, the choices range from \" skinny to fat\" , the dishes are very different and creative, and the place has an awesome vibe.  Its always a treat to eat here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in vegas! The healthy/happy concept is unique and I've eaten something different there every time. The staff is super friendly and always in a good mood. If I could give 6 stars then I would!"}
{"text":"Food is always great as well as the super nice servers! I get the Sweet Cheese-us usually, but I've been trying other things lately to explore the menu. Their grilled cheese (Grilled Please, is what it's called) is excellent as well! I've tried one of their juices, Defense Up, I think. It was sooo good! Haven't left disappointed once, and I don't think I ever will. This location definitely has the cheeriest staff. Will of course be back!"}
{"text":"A great spot. The menu is full of healthy & not so healthy choices, but all of the food is really fresh and promptly served by their friendly staff. I went with the More Cow Bell which is egg fried rice, teriyaki filet mignon, cauliflower & peppers. It was excellent. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I had the Cheesus sandwich and it was way good. The food was brought out fast and it did not disappoint at all!! It is a bit in the cut and sorta hidden in plain view but inside it is very cool. Chill vibe with colorful drawings on the wooden walls inside is a pretty cool touch. The strawberry lemonade I had with my meal was very tasty and refreshing and complimented the food greatly. This place doesn't have booze but that is ok because the food more than made up for it. If you're in Vegas try this place out and leave the chain restaurants for another time."}
{"text":"Went to eat here for lunch with my buddies And ordered the TU-NUTS, pimp shrimp and truffle fries. Tuna was fresh and blended perfectly with the aioli. Pimp shrimp was delightful! If you ever drop by this place look for khaycee, service was top notch and always greeted us with a smile."}
{"text":"Great experience! The food was awesome, the employees were even more awesome. Chill & very welcoming atmosphere. Wish I could remember the employees names but they were all really nice!"}
{"text":"Loved skinny fats! Great menu, visited several times and never had a bad dish (from either side!). Ambiance is cozy- lots of wood features and a really earthy feel- definitely a great lunch place or a couple friends grabbing a bite- it's a bit small and tightly packed for large groups, but the food is well worth the visit in the afternoon. The juices are awesome as well.   Definitely going back. It's a whole thing now."}
{"text":"EAT HERE. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. Dined here yesterday for the first time & I am still in awe at how incredible it was. I didn't even know about SkinnyFats until yesterday afternoon haha. Firstly, I was amazed at their menu options. Loved the breakdown of the menu & the healthy | happy sides of the menu. The selection was impeccable, the meals were unique, pricing was fair, & there were vegan, vegetarian & gluten free options available! Secondly, I was blown away by how KIND, RESPECTFUL, PROMPT & HAPPY the service / employees were at this location. You could tell that everyone genuinely likes to represent their business & that is something that is lacking at most establishments these days. The cashier was courteous & greeted us upon coming in, she took the time to break down the menu for us & go over the craft beers available. She knew the menu & made recommendations. I got the Zucc It bowl- 8/10 (a little spicy but so delicious  the zucchini noodles were filling & the veggies in it were amazing) I also got the Healthy Hangover juice- 10/10 (the cashier was kind enough to sub the celery with orange for me), & a lemon blueberry cookie - 9/10, would give 10/10 if they were vegan or gluten free but it was still sooo good  (which the very kind lady comped for me after I waited in line to get a box when I didn't have to lol. What place is that cool!? That's so nice of them. Seriously.) My boyfriend got the Ahi tacos which were full of flavor-10/10, truffle fries 10/10, a raspberry beer 8/10 (has a tart yet very sweet taste but pretty good). Our friend came with us & was a few people behind in line but they brought his food out at the same time as ours! All around the service was impeccable. Restaurant was very clean, they had eco friendly bathrooms / sinks, the seating selection was nice. I could go on. Shoutout to the people on shift yesterday, you all were amazing & I will be back to this location for that alone! (:"}
{"text":"Didn't even know this restaurant existed despite driving by numerous times. A friend dragged us in for a late lunch. At first I thought we had driven to the wrong place since the outside looked like a garage but once we went inside we were really shocked. The food is great and healthy, the prices aren't too expensive and the service is pretty quick. Wished there was more room to sit but we didn't have a problem finding a table despite the place being full. Also, loved the names of the items on the menu (\"sweet cheese-us\", \"buffchix\", etc)."}
{"text":"UH-MAZING. I had the salmon sandwich, it was a special. I hope they put it on their menu permanently. The ONLY thing that was a little frustrating was that I was in there at noon so of course it was packed, and the only two tables they had open were next to the window, it was just really hot and the sun was going into my eyes. They just really need some blinds or screens, or something. But their food is A++++. I'll be ordering stuff to go from now on though because of the lack of seating."}
{"text":"My girlfriend was excited to try this place I myself had never heard about it. The workers were very nice but for me that's about all this place had to offer. I'm just not into healthy/semi-healthy food so my review might be a little unfair. There is no plain water in this place it's cucumber water which isn't too bad but different. The food was very bland and even as good as my food looked it just didn't taste good. I'll never be back but like I said my review may be unfair because this just isn't my type of restaurant..."}
{"text":"So one of my friends said that we should try out Skinny Fats the other day and I thought that I would give it a try.   The location is in an commercial area of town and I thought that this was weird. Once you enter the restaurant you forget where you are at. The restaurant has a nice feel once you enter.   I order the Chicken sandwich which comes with 2 chicken breasts with the sweet potatoes. I thought that the sandwich was very good. My friend ordered one of the breakfast items and it looked amazing. The only down side for me was the strawberry lemonade, it tasted watered down. All drinks come in a reusable cup!  Overall, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Eat like a fat boy in a healthy land w a gourmet twist! Awesome staff and friendly people who work here!!"}
{"text":"I've gone to both locations and so far, neither one disappoints. only downside is this one is smaller so I don't recommend a big group because it'll be difficult to find seating together.   as for the food, I got the ahi taco and chicken n waffle. my fiance got the flatbread. it was all delectable as expected. also, their chocolate chip cookies are bomb and the Nutella with banana shake made me feel like a fatty but it was so worth it."}
{"text":"yummm. I went to this location last Sunday on my bday. let's just say... I highly recommend It. obviously I ordered off the happy side. and needless to say, I was happy with my food. I ordered a burger and my side was a cookie. the burger was so filling, I couldn't even make it to the cookie.   the decor is vintage and has pinterest written all over it. with the old school light bulbs hanging down, to the wood covered walls and pretty bathrooms. my favorite part with the salt and pepper shaker shaped like and little man."}
{"text":"Even weeks after my first taste of the Meltdown, the craving lingers! Will have to visit again (and again, and again) to satiate the craving.  Bravo, Chef Green!"}
{"text":"Okay, okay. I get what all the hype is about. Great extensive menu with healthy and delicious options. Super fast even when it was packed. The chicken and waffles were killer. Love that the soda fountain has some fun options instead of the usuals. Craving this place ever since!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and gives you the option to follow your diet or enjoy a cheat meal. So far everything I have tried here was delicious and they even offer real cane sugar soft drinks. I enjoy taking my clients out on lunch to this spot as it always pleases. Thanks skinnyfats and special thanks to the staff."}
{"text":"Super friendly and attentive staff! The food was great. The location is funky and chill, loved the outdoor patio space."}
{"text":"First off, super friendly employees! Well trained to be pleasant, almost sappy pleasant. I thought they were being fake pleasant at first, but I apologize for that assumption. They genuinely wanted to serve their customers well. I had just flown in to Vegas from back east and was pretty hungry by 10:30am local time. As I pulled up I thought my gps sent me to the wrong place because this joint is located in an industrial neighborhood, but it's right on the street and the location worked.  There were only a few people there and I was able to order right away. I wanted the ahi tacos and ordered a skinny one and a fat one, along with an order of truffle fries I had seen bragged about on yelp. The skinny one was a grilled ahi and came on a small wheat tortilla served in a small bowl. You had to eat it with a fork at first because it was so loaded. Don't get me wrong, they weren't big tacos, they were about the size of street tacos, but they were stuffed with ahi and veggies and sirachi. The fat taco was fried ahi with a creamy mango salsa served on a tiny taco bowl like the kind you get with a taco salad.  They were both very different and VERY GOOD! I'd get one of each again if I went there again. Well done! And the truffle fries? Meh.. They were good but not OMG YOU GOTTA GET THE TRUFFLE FRIES good. I like this place because it has a little bit of everything: breakfast food, burgers, tacos, salads, sandwiches, all with a skinny and a fatty version. Beware though, by the time I left around 11, the place was full and there were about 10 people in line. Yikes! I'd hate to see noon..."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is truly the best of both worlds! Perfect for any palate!! Their slogan is simply perfect- live healthy, live happy- the Choice is yours, & honestly their food accommodates both! I am a total breakfast lover (which is served all day here) and I was beyond impressed with their \"wake & bacon\" breakfast sandwich. Every plate that came out looked delicious, so the next time I'm in Vegas, I'll have to try another plate! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Really good fresh ingredients. Would do a 5 star but they can't seem to get my eggs right! I like my whites extra dry over done. Always a bit watery under cooked for my tastes. Otherwise everything else is awesome!"}
{"text":"Had a couple friends recommend this to me, so decided to give a try while I was in town. So glad I did! The caulifire is amazing just enough spicy for me! (And I live spicy!) The shrimp boat was amazing and healthy for you! Love the atmosphere and the staff was friendly! Can't wait to come back! They need to put one of these closer to where I live!"}
{"text":"This is becoming one of my favorite places to eat and have a cold press juice. The customer service is great, and I really like the unique menu."}
{"text":"Their food was good. The truffle fries was good , but it wasn't enough to my order. I wish they could put more, but mostly it was good. Next time I will try their chicken and waffles. Their service was friendly and good. The most of all their famous  warm chocolate chip cookies was the best. It was good and very warm. They ran out that night, but when I order the sugar cookies and asked what was taking for long. They asked me if I want the chocolate chip cookies instead. When my friend and I tried, it was very good and very warm. I would go back for more."}
{"text":"My review is based on a couple recent visits. Had the HappyMess off the secret menu, truffle fries topped with blue cheese, steak, and pico de gallo. For the price, $11, there should have been a little more steak, but it still tasted pretty good.  For the second visit, arrived a little before noon and was able to snag a table for four, something we wouldn't have been able to do if we got there any later. Had the ChickHumm, grilled chicken breast with hummus, sprouts, tomato, and onion on a whole wheat bun, also added avocado (+$1). It was super tasty. Also had a Ahi Srirachi taco, good, but not as good as I remember; I may just be getting tired of them as that had been a go-to. Got a tropical tea that came with free refills, basic decent tropical tea. Staff is very friendly and always on top of keeping the tables clean. Been here various times and plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Finally giving this place a try its was well over due  I ordered ahi taco and steak salad (not their names )  1 chocolate chip cookie ( not gluten free )   They didn't have the calorie count for any of the food which kind of sucks because I count cals religiously   And they couldn't tell me if the food was GMO FREE  the food was really good tho definitely would go back   In their menu they have a healthy side and the tasty side so that's pretty cool"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise !   Took the gf, another friend and her daughter to dinner at SF a few nights ago.  Unusual location but not out of the way.  The eating area is kinda small but comfortable.  Laughed when I hit the restroom and determined the men's room is almost equal in size to the dining area.  The menu is a little confusing but the concept is simply  you got food for health conscious people and food for a fat ass like me.  we ordered:  flat chicken and greens ( $8 ) with a side of fruit ( included in price - not sure why )   Chicken and waffles ( $8.50)  - secret, off menu item  Nice to greek you healthy pizza flat bread/pizza ( 9.50 )  Maine Wedge happy salad ( $4.50 )   Highlights - well, basically EVERYTHING !  great value, well prepared and creative.  I can't believe i'm going to write this but I think the prices are on the low side for what you get - the wedge salad ( pic incl ) has large chunks of cheese and bacon with the egg and then you smash on one of the lettuce spears - Mmmmmm - good stuff ! and at $4.50 ??? are you kiddin' me !  The flat chicken and greens has a full chicken breast smashed done and grilled, seasoned perfectly with a bed of greens - the gf was happy.  I guess a slight ding is the chicken and waffles - the chicken need a little more seasoning ( salt ) but overall, we were very happy with the combo.  And heck, I even liked the healthy pizza.  total bill with sodas was $50.  Yes, we will be back !"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and i come here often but today wasn't so great. Honestly it kind of feels like the cooking is getting sloppy. I ordered the classic and of course there was a long line and the place was crowded so i was expecting to wait a good 20 minutes or so for my food. I got my food in like less than 10 minutes of ordering. That was a red flag. My fiance got the smotherload and his food came out at the same time. My fries were not hot and they were really stale and cold like they were yesterday's fries. Burger was ok luckily my meat was hot but it was probably thrown in a microwave or something. The potatoes in the smotherload were still hard and not cooked all the way. The food was done half fast. My fiance ended up getting sick right after on the drive home. Like i said i love this place but PLEASE cook the food fresh. I know the place gets super busy but when the food comes out crappy people do notice."}
{"text":"Delicious food! So excited about the new locations opening up! I would urge you to bring back the caprazy salad... Pleeeeeeaaasee! It was the most magical salad I've ever put in my mouth. Just do it, bring it back. Right now. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped into our favorite juice place fir some quick refreshing yet high quality drinks. We got the liquid defense which is a  blend of apple , carrot, orange,lemon , lime and basil very refreshing . We also got a drink from the \"Happy\" side, the smooth immunity which consisted of orange lime basil and opted for ice cream instead of 2% , soy or yogurt since the other drink was already on the \"healthy\" side \"=) both equally delicious!"}
{"text":"Yum! Great place so glad we came across it on Yelp. We will be back when we're on that side of town again!  Highlights: -tacos (YUM! Crispy fish, tangy sauce.) -a \"different\" and delicious fountain beverage selection -The Classic burger was delicious & perfect portion-size -fun atmosphere, clean -friendly staff"}
{"text":"This is the first time at this location.  Food was good.  Much better than the my first experience.  Had the Chix in Broadway.   One of the better chicken sandwiches that I've had.  Lots of toppings.  Inside seating was packed and had to sit outside, too bad that it was very windy.   Lots of people there for lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome food. My wife loves the rice w cilantro. I love everything especially the burger. Great place and awesome food. Best delivery food available"}
{"text":"I love skinny fats! I will literally do the 20 min drive there. I love how you have the choice to pick whether you want to eat Healy or be a fat ass! Customer service is top notch from the moment you place your order down to the server. Never have to wait a long time for the food to be ready either, always quick service!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. Great service! Delicious food! It actually tasted real! If you're tired of all the BS go here! Good service and good food still exist at a great price! And they make their own version of cola using real sugar. Even if you're not a soda drinker this is a good cheat for you."}
{"text":"THANK YOU!!!!! Customer service AMAZING, food.. Quick and amazing!!! Thank you so much for always making us feel welcome. THANK YOU TONY! He gave into giving my daughter more fries!!!"}
{"text":"I will preface with one thing, I do not like the house made soda, it tastes gross Otherwise, the food is soooo good Things worth trying: The turkey BLT, it is really good, and has lots of  turkey bacon Slow boat to china, just yummy and fun The greek flat bread, I order with extra olives and feta cheese, which is sooooo good the sweet potato fries are greatt"}
{"text":"this service here is great.   the food is super unique and serves top quality ingredients.  the craft beer is soooooo good.   my favorite beer is the peach ipa. my go to meal is the cherry popper burger with truffle fries and there housemade black pepper ketchup."}
{"text":"Dark interior complicated my ability to read the menu which is unique! I gave in to my oft delightful ordering technique and asked the staff what would be sure to bring me back!  The chicken sandwich with truffle fries fit the bill!  Cucumber milkshake prepared with choice of frozen product and choice of milk too!  I was a happy camper! A great ace to order ahead to take home! Seating limited! Staff was attentive and good natured!! The half sandwich left over was selfishly hidden and enjoyed two days later and was still impressively yummy!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning breakfast was a hit at SkinnyFATS awesome menu my first time here this location is small and tables are hard to find, since there is no sitting service you have to be quick to get a table as soon as customers are getting ready to leave. Food was delicious the avocado toast and breakfast burrito as well. bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Perfect delicious food when your pregnant and always in the mood for a good combination of yummy exotic flavors to what we desire. I loves the strawberry lemonade, staff is always smiles and wonderful people. Great team working together"}
{"text":"I can't say much for the skinny side of the menu, because I haven't been able to overcome the temptations of the happy side of the menu. however, that doesn't mean I won't ever venture over there... Truthfully, when faced with the choice, the fatter side of me wins out every time. The food at Skinnyfats is fantastic! I've had the Chix on Broadway, with a side of truffle fries, and the Happymess. Both of which were nothing short of delicious (and very filling). Pretty much everything on the menu looks tasty, and I have set a goal to try it all. Service has always been warm and inviting. Definitely a good spot to stop and eat or carry out!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy I have found another great place for good food in Las Vegas! Whoever said that there aren't good places to eat in Vegas are highly mistaken!   The location is a little off, but I like that it is not in the mainstream areas of town and hidden in a little niche in the business park. I would never have expected to eat such good food there, but once you walk in they have done a really good job at creating an awesome atmosphere. You kind of forget that you are in an office park.   The staff were wonderful! Lana who helped us with some recommendations was fun, friendly, and really helpful! It was kind of neat to talk to someone who was so happy about her job! You don't see that too often now a days! In my opinion, she deserves a raise! ;)   Lastly, the food was superb! We went for my fathers birthday! Some call us picky eaters; We are not picky at all. We actually love all types of food, but we just really love good food! This place definitely knows how to make it happen! We had a few different plates and they were all magnificent.  I will definitely be going there again! Really spectacular!"}
{"text":"First time @ Skinny fats. We initially past by the location because its in an business park type area. Once inside it has a very modern hipster feel w/ soft techno music & a diverse crowd. Young, old, & in between was here. The food was really good, fresh, &.....good!!! This is the Cheeseburger Benedict."}
{"text":"Over priced! Asked for medium well burger, but got it medium rare. \"Truffle\" fries were nothing close to it, just a few sprinkles. Luckily Amy was able to help me out and got me a separate order. Such a kind woman and very helpful! But unfortunately the restaurant didn't live up to the hype. The service is great but the food isn't."}
{"text":"My daughter took me to this restaurant last night. The food and service was excellent! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has good food, and the service is always in excellence.  Despite it always being busy, the staff is always helpful and moving along to help each person.   I almost tried everything on the menu, but my favorites areTu-Nuts, S'Motherload and Chix on Broadway...  I tried the unBrieVable and thought the balsamic didnt work well, but it was a nice try.  Everything else i have had there has been good"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've been here twice and both times were an amazing experience. They have lots of selections but the one that I got today was the Smoke in a Bowl. The chicken was tender and cooked to perfection. The tomatoes and onions were freshly diced. The salsa was also very good. I like to eat my food with the special jalapeño ketchup that they have. I also got the ahi srirachi tuna taco. The tacos are served a little different than your usual taco - they are stuffed with fresh ingredients. The fish tasted really good. I've tried their tea before and it's not hard to tell that it's really made from the best stuff. This place is perfect for people who are looking for a healthier alternative and for those looking for the \"happier side.\" I've only gone during lunch time and both times I've experienced long lines but they usually go pretty fast. The place is a little small so when you see people getting up, you better save that table. Customer service is really awesome in this place. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Benedict Burger and Truffle Fries are awesome.  Also want to try the tuna and fruit juices next time."}
{"text":"Just dang good!!! Can't go wrong with ANYTHING!!! This should be your \"go to place\" when it comes to feeding both sides of the scale!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about...  The asian theme burger was really wet and hard to eat, and wasn't amazing flavor wise compared to the Umami burger the dish was meant to mimic.  My date got the chicken and waffles, which were OK, but nothing special (and lets be real, chicken and waffles are kind of hard to mess up.)  The service was about what you might expect from a place like subway, with the ordering happening at a front counter, and the reception of a number.  We didn't get silverware or condiments on our table, and had to go in search of those things ourselves.  We didn't see the waitress at all, really, until we dropped the tip on the table, even though it was late and we were one of about 3 tables currently in use.  I'm a big soda fan, and they had some really good original recipe stuff on tap.  Everything from creme and orange soda to root beer and some kind of red velvet thing.  I tried and enjoyed all of them, and if there was anything that stood out it would be the soda.  The idea behind the restaurant is an interesting one, but I didn't really see the appeal.  I don't plan to come back, but I wouldn't be mad if friends were to ask me to meet them there."}
{"text":"Marc at the front counter is amazing!!! Service is top for this type of place in Vegas! Don't forget about Marc!"}
{"text":"I love love love love love this place Have ordered many diffrent dishes and never have been disappointed it reminds me a lot of austin tx and there venues"}
{"text":"This place is so unique! It's basically in the middle of nowhere and I barely found it (even with the giant billboard). When I got inside the environment was so interesting and completely new to me! Personally I loved the place, the service was great and friendly! The food was also good (I tried the Meltdown) the menu itself was fun to look through. The inside had this very nice and clean look where it felt pleasing to be, honestly though it's probably more of a youthful atmosphere reason being for the loud (not to loud) pop/reggae like music. Overall it's a great little hidden gem and I would probably come back again!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times already, as well as the other location. Every time they do an awesome job! On 2/7/16 I came back and got their benedict of the week (a pizza benny) it was definitely unique doing a benedict on top of a small pizza but it was actually really good, the tempura fried pepperoni was a highlight.  On other visits I've had the Cherry Popper burger and the Sweet Cheesus and both were great. The Boylan soda on tap is awesome!  Although they do take out I would really recommend eating there if you have any distance to drive because although it is still good you definitely miss out on how good the food really is when it cools down."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Definitely recommend since they both have a regular and healthy menu."}
{"text":"I had to the fat part and it was yummy. Truffle fries were awesome. Next time might try healthier side of menu!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Cali, went here for breakfast after our original choice was not open. Found this spot based on the strength of reviews. My first impression was, \"this is the type of funky little joint you either love or it drives you crazy\". It's located in a business strip on Dean Martin Blvd.; be careful or it's easy to drive right past it.  Inside is quite small and there were 7 of us. We were allowed to move a couple of tables to accommodate our size. You order first and then have a seat. The menu is divided into a healthy side and a happy side, and have funky unique names; we settled on Apple Bottom, Cluck Moo, Berry Strong Pancakes, Chickawaffadopolis, Waken Bacon, and the pineapple pancakes (can't remember name), coffees, and an apple juice. We all enjoyed our meals, except for the Berry Pancakes. The flavor combinations on that were too much, especially the mint yogurt, for it to be good.   My favorite part of the day was how easily they helped with a mistake we had with our meal. I understand that mistakes happen, but I appreciate when businesses help to resolve. The employees were are all extremely nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Naughty or nice? Skinny or fat? The menu is divided up into two sections: happy & healthy. I like that you have the choice, depending if you're looking to indulge or opting for clean eats (the \"healthy\" section is 600 calories or less).   The rustic decor is intriguing & industrial with random surprise accent pieces with vibrant colors, and the service is efficient yet friendly. We came in feeling like breakfast, and luckily this place has an all-day breakfast section of the menu!  For her: - STEAK EYES (happy side): country fried filet mignon medallions over biscuits with gravy topped with two eggs. So much flavor, worth every calorie! ;) For him: - PINEAPPLE JACKS (healthy side): 2 multigrain protein pancakes with grilled pineapple & turkey bacon. This is actually served with pineapple syrup and hot pineapple slices, but ironically he doesn't even like pineapple. He got this on this side, which I happily ate & tried with it... so yummy!"}
{"text":"I used to think Greens and Protein was the shit until I found out about Skinny FATS! The service is great, lots of young professionals. The menu is as perfect. All items come out exactly how described, portions are perfect, food itself is high quality. I don't think there is a single item that is disappointing. If I had to make an off comment it would be the fact that it's located in whats supposed to be small franchise office space. I would assume its to have cost effective rent, and seeing as though its a lunch place, they can pull it off. I heard there is a more elaborate location in Hendertucky. I don't mind the make shift office because you get what you expect, pay for and more, and that can be a rare find in Vegas! Also it's mainly healthy items, so you can't beat it with a stick! Hey I am from the East Coast so if I say the food is great, and worth it, than damn it it is!! Stay just the way you are Skinny Fats!!"}
{"text":"This little place is a hidden gem. It's tucked away and way too small for the amount of business but it's worth every dime. We stand in line and anxiously wait for seats but love the food. Wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The staff is always so friendly especially Fonz. She is very knowledgeable of the menu and does an excellent job at explaining the dishes in detail. She sure knows her stuff! My wife and I truly love this place!! You have to try the cookies!! They are amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Has a great menu with options for the healthy eater and the fat kid in all of us.  The balsamic and bleu is awesome and is my regular choice.  Burgers are also really good and the chicken soup is awesome.  Moderate heat but overall a very good soup.    Best place for lunch around here."}
{"text":"My first time here.. The menu is split into two sides... You can order healthy to stay skinny or non-healthy to be fat.. The food was prompt and was very delicious.. Our water and the whole staff were very pleasant.. I recommend trying this place.."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken sandwich and fries. Food is very tasty. If you go there in the afternoon you may need to wait to get a seat.  Over all very good restaurant"}
{"text":"The hubby and I decided to try this place again, and man...what a difference!   We came late at night, probably 8pm? so we didn't have any trouble finding seats and the staff was quite at there leisure and willing to help us pickout our dinners this night.   What we got:  They have a really phenomenal iced tea (I like them cool, refreshing and unsweatened...this hit the mark perfectly) 5/5 the truffle fries, they were good, but I wasn't amazed and probably wouldn't order them again. 3/5 Ahi Srirachi taco very good 5/5 Ahi taco san very good 5/5 Flat chix and greens. LOVE, love this concept, it's just a lean chicken breast that becomes the \"crust\" with a bunch of dark argula greens and sauce. so healthy and yummy!! 5/5 Nice to Greek pizza. when we ate it there i didn't really like it 2/5, but when i warmed it up the next day it was REALLY good. i think the crust softened a bit and we liked it! 5/5  Also, this is an odd think to notice, but I love the decor, they have the B-ball game on, and their bathrooms are really clean. (It shows that the business cares about every aspect of their restaurant)"}
{"text":"Came the opening day and was greeted by the cashiers with a cheerful greeting. Great first impression! Ive been to all other locations in the city and was impressed about the size of this one. Down the middle is a large, heavy set table with a large smiling face at the end. Booths line the wall as well as a bar-esque type seating in front of the kitchen. Food is the same great quality as the other Skinny Fats which is why we decided to come visit. Never disappointed with the food nor the customer service, I'm glad this small joint in Dean Martin decided to give North Las Vegas a try. Finally a great brunch/all day place in this area!"}
{"text":"So amazing!! Best brunch spot in Vegas hands down. Take a drive, grab and uber, do what u gotta do, but get to SkinnyFats at least once while in Vegas. Great food, fair prices, cool vibe. 5 stars all day!!"}
{"text":"Decent service and great food. They have great sandwiches (Meltdown and Chix on Broadway are popular). Fresh juices were so tasty, I like liquid defense which has a combination of Orange, Carrot, Apple, Lemon, Lime and Basil."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the \"fat\" part. Not sure if I really have a favorite on the menu, but I've ordered the fish tacos more than once. Are they serving champagne yet? That would make it my #1 brunch place. Just down the street."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Las Vegas from California and found this gem on Yelp. I love the concept of having the happy vs healthy menu - I haven't seen anything like that before. The restaurant is clean, the staff are friendly and the food is DELICIOUS. I ordered the Vegwich (portobello mushroom burger) with sweet potato fries and my friend ordered the Steakation (steak burger) with truffle fries. We both loved our orders. There are many other options on the menu I'd love to try so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yassssss, SKINNYFATS in my neighborhood. So damn good. Nom nom nom. Outdoor seating arrived just in time for the excellent weather we will be having shortly. Beautiful atmosphere & delicious food."}
{"text":"Prices are a little higher than most places but its close and open early. They just redid the inside looks nice. Would really like if they had better seating or booths. Hard to visit because it's so noisy. All and all thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth checking out. After looking at the reviews online, my hubs and I decided to stop in late Saturday afternoon. It was pretty busy considering it was around 2pm, however we were still able to find a table. We ordered the chicken and waffles, blaze cauliflower and ahi tacos. Yummmmmmmy! This will probably be my new brunch spot. P.S. - breakfast is served all day."}
{"text":"Everything about this place.  Staff/service is awesome, menu is diverse and very neat, overall concept is very cool, and of course the food is great!  My boyfriend and I were looking for a quick place to eat that wouldn't be out of our way as we were leaving Vegas. We happened to find this place without any idea of what to expect other than the fact that it seemed to have some breakfast/lunch options. I am so happy we dropped by.   I love the whole concept and theme that skinnyFATS has going on. The way the menu is spread out is really cool - you have a \"healthy\" side and a \"happy\" side. The healthy side includes calorie information with lower calorie options and the happy side includes items that you'll want to indulge in. If you look at the two items side by side, they are very similar options (i.e. a low cal breakfast burrito vs a more caloric breakfast burrito). I got the wrap supastar and it was really good. My boyfriend had the steak eyes. Let me tell you, that gravy was delicious!  Why are you only located in Vegas!!! Pleaseee open more locations.  In the meantime, I'll have to make a stop here every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Yelping when out of town, in hopes of coming across an off-the-beaten path spot. Glad I found SkinnyFats.  Ordered the TBLT with truffle fries (smothered in jalapeño catsup), and the Nice To Greek You.  Both were delicious. I was hoping to make it back for breakfast, but simply ran out of time. Will visit again on my next Vegas run."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great food . My wife and I had the sweet cheeseus and the melt down it was soooo delicious. Chocolate chip cookie was awesome too, Also had the Charlie Brownie shake it had Nutella banana and strawberries yum. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place came as a recommendation to me from a friend.  It's like Stacks and Yolks and Smashburger had a baby and it was named Skinny Fats. The flavors and the presentation are out of this world. I had the Skinny Q and it was A-mazing. My girl had the Chickhumm and she was in heaven. The pictures I've provided will speak for themselves. Bottom line, this place gets 2  up from me."}
{"text":"Service is great. The food is amazing. The selection is really awesome because you can choose to be a super fatty pants or go for the slightly healthier options. Either way, you're bound to enjoy it because all of their food is outstanding. The only downside to this joint is that it's RIDICULOUSLY tiny! There's rarely a place to sit down and the line gets so long that, even if you did have a place to sit, you would probably have the butts of those standing in line all up in your face while attempting to eat your meal. Now, I have not been to their other location, so I'm not sure if that is the same story over there. But this location is far to tiny for a fully enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Great food and great service!  The menu has so many great healthy options, I never leave feeling sick like most restaurants make you feel!  Love the gluten free options!  A gluten free cookie would be the perfect finishing touch if they offered one"}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place! First impression was great! Loved their menu with the healthy and happy side. Lol. Girl at the register was really helpful. Giving us help with the menu; what's popular, what she recommended, & the secret menu. I plan to stop by here every time I visit Vegas now!   The only con about this place is that it's a bit tiny. Place gets packed and people waiting for tables are standing around blocking the walk ways. I hope they open another location with more space. && just wishful thinking, I hope they open one in So Cal! ;D"}
{"text":"So we finally got around to trying Skinny Fats!  We attempted to visit the Dean Martin location once and it just was no our scene at all. Cramped restaurant that seemed to focus more on atmosphere than anything else. Needless to say it took a while before we finally made it to the Warm Springs location to try the good out.   Definitely worth the wait!  I had the Cranburkey and my husband had the classic. Both were incredible, but the fries left something to be desired. The sweet potato and regular fries were both undercooked.   The French fry disaster was a shame but not enough to keep us from visiting again."}
{"text":"Food is still awesome, but even better management actually cares about guest experience and listens to their guests feedback, I was so happy to see they installed a diaper changer in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! There always coming up with new recipes that taste great! Defiantly a place to try if your visiting Vegas or live in Vegas!!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!"}
{"text":"A really tasty spot.  I came here before I went to get my tattoo in Vegas.  Needed something hearty.  When you driving down the dean Martin street...first thing you notice is the big billboard sign that says skinny fats.  When you pull in...there's pretty decent size parking.  Unless the place is really packed...you probably won't have issues with parking.  Walking into the place, you notice how lively and colorful the place is.  So many different images and colors on the walls...the staff here are super friendly and helpful.  Medium size restaurant....two rows of seats and barstools along one side of the wall.  They have two different types of menu.  \"Happy\" and \"healthy\".  I ordered the cherry popper...a \"happy\" burger.  The burger was bomb!  The burger was ginormous, and the patty was juicy.  Cooked perfectly.  There was an over easy egg on top.  Wished it was more gooey...but the burger itself was delicious.  It came with truffle fries.  That was excellent too.  The fries were nice and crispy.  I ate the whole plate!  So good!  I would definitely come back!  Actually I did...came back after my tattoo .  I would recommend this place if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went strictly by Yelp to choose this place. Loved it. We had the buffalo Cauliflower, the Thai Salad and the Balsamic Salad.  There is a version of the buffalo cauliflower I have had that is to die for, and so this one was just okay by comparison.  The Thai Salad - I would have many times over as I loved this and a good size as well.  My traveling partners both had the Balsamic Salad with the beef and liked it very much."}
{"text":"OMG. I got here and it was like WTH, middle of industrial area. Is the place even open? Couldn't find the front door.   But once you are in, holy cow, the food is amazing! I had the Sunday special eggs Benedict, my wife a burger, and the food was truly spectacular. Creative recipes and tasty takes on classic dishes.  Definitely visit this or the other location.  Good job SkinnyFat. You created a good product at fair prices."}
{"text":"I have been seeing lots of their postings on Instagram & heard friends talk about this place, so FINALLY I went. There menu is an overload of goodness that it took me a minute to decide what to eat. The cheerful staff members were happy to bring that overload to a boiling point by mentioning secret menu items they also had.   Finally I made the decision to go w/ their version of nachos, the Hot Mess (Flour tortilla chips, buffalo chicken bites, pico, cheese sauce, jalapeños, sour cream & jalapeño ranch). Everything was SO tasty. I had my reservations about the chips, but I get that these is a healthier type of nachos. The size of the chips though was my main issue as they broke off while trying to gather all the ingredients on the chip. The chips were a bit bigger than the normal sized chips that come in a nacho setup. Other than that the flavors were quite tasty.   I also got Hot Chix (Breaded buffalo chicken, bleu, pico, avocado & fried jalapeño strips over romaine tossed in buffalo ranch) to go. Such a tasty salad.   W/ so many options to choose from this place is def one I will be going back to for more tasty treats. The atmosphere is so clean & full of energy. Love it!"}
{"text":"Freaking love this place and I can tell I have a lot of work ahead of me with this one. Everything on the menu looks so good and very unique. I had the sweet cheese us, a philly with REAL béchamel sauce base, quality cheddar and pepper jack, cherry peppers, caramelized onion and portabello mushroom. The roll was perfect, sandwich not greasy. The steak shocked me since its not that super chopped stuff you usually get. The sandwich is a little on the spicy side though for you wimps out there. It's definitely one of my top 3 philly's i've ever had. Also, try the sodas. Never heard of the company until now, but i had the black cherry soda. Free refills!! Do yourself a favor and get a large, its that good. Only downside is this place is on the small side with limited seating. I ordered my food to-go because of that, no biggie."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas last weekend and have eaten here four times during my trip. It's inexpensive and delicious. Their menu is split between a healthy and happy side. I enjoyed both. The meals I've had were the Smoke in a Bowl, More Cow Bowl, The Meltdown, and the Sweet Cheese Us. I highly recommend giving those a try. The bowls were full of flavor and filled me up. I did not feel groggy whatsoever. The patties that were used for The Meltdown and Sweet Cheese Us were light, fresh, and juicy. The pieces of bread used for the sandwiches were nicely toasted. The sandwiches came with a choice of a side and I was instantly hooked on their crispy sweet potato fries. I did try two of their appetizers: The Caulifire and Fats Pickles. Sadly, I wasn't a fan of either one of them. The sauce used for the cauliflower was too runny for my liking and the fried pickles were drenched in oil when I received them. After dabbing the grease off of two pickles the napkin was done for. Besides that, I did enjoy my visits to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks fairly small. But definitely worth it. The pricing of the food is fairly cheap (between $7-12 depending on your choice. The staff was exceptionally friendly and very helpful when explaining the menu.   Basically, they serve both healthy food and fattening foods. (Where the name, skinnyfats, came from obviously)   I ordered from the skinny menu. I got a Naked Chix (grilled chicken marinated in mango sauce over brown rice) with a side house salad. The food was absolutely delicious. This is by far my favorite place to eat. It was my first time but I highly recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"We came during 10:00am breakfast hours it was packed but moved smoothly. There is limited seating. I ordered the cinnutella which was Hawaiian bread French toast with Nutella smeared on the bottom and fresh berries on top. We also had the chicken and waffles plate. The chicken didn't have any flavor but they serve a nice portion. The prices are about average but the serving size is great ."}
{"text":"It's was an awesome spot especially just getting off the plane and being hungry.  Food is fresh and fast. Lots to choose from. The flavors were excellent.  The different aioli on each item was great. We got the balls and they were excellent.  We got two tacos and a burger. The fried egg was great but not runny like I like it. But that's ok."}
{"text":"Was tasty and the wait staff was very nice!  My food was cold but they reheated it up nicely. Free refills on coffee and cute decor. The place was full of people and the location is in a warehouse pretty much. I see why they come back!"}
{"text":"So good. I had been wanting to try skinny fats for some time and it did not disapoint. The steak was so tender and full of flavor.  The food came out quick and correct. The restraunt was quite crowded when we arrived but by the time we ordered a table opened up. I would definitely eat here again in fact it will probably be soon."}
{"text":"Yum!! There is something for everyone here. (And there are multiple locations) They were quick and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"As a fellow foodie I had to scout out some restaurants before I got to Vegas. I didn't want to eat at all the typical spots on the strip. So I found this hidden gem.  It's a very small place with limited seating but we didn't have a problem getting a seat. When you walk in you can place your order then they'll bring your food to you.  Which by the way staff is super friendly, answers any questions and patient while you try to figure out what to order.   I went ahead and ordered one of their healthy smoothies, sweet cheese us and the shareable caulifire.  First I really love the concept of this restaurant. They have the \"healthy\" side and the \"happy\" side. I was on vacation so I went straight to happy.  Their variation of the philly sub was sooooo good and it had plenty of cheese which definitely made me happy.  The fries were okay I think I would have preferred trying the sweet potatoes fries. They also had their own variation of ketchup which was neat but I just wanted plain ketchup which wasn't to be found. The caulifire had more of a kick than I expected but very good.  The smoothie was definitely healthy no added sugars which I loved.  Little different then most other smoothies but well blended and good taste. I believe I had the hangover cure in preparation to the night to come. They have other items on menu I'd like to try so if ever back in Vegas I may have to add it again to this list."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. So crowded for a Sunday at two. We were just picking up goo and they forgot a taco, but quickly refunded us out money."}
{"text":"The good: good food! Nice inside and outside eating area.  The bad: there's always 1 of 2 registers open which causes long lines!"}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to eat. They have so much color and personality here - the mood is contagious.  Sometimes on the weekend or during peak times, there is a wait. At this specific location, it can be cutthroat to grab a table!  One side of the menu is their \"skinny\" side and the other is their \"enjoy yourself\" side. ;) You'll find there might be a menu item on one side with it's skinny/fat counterpart on the opposite side of the menu, which I like. Don't let any guilt dissuade you from ordering from the \"fats\" side as it's all so yummy. If you and a friend have to order from the skinny side, get something from the other side to share!  They also have their own soda which is fantastic and fun to try."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Everything is delicious. I especially love ordering off the \"Healthy side\" of the menu--lose the guilt without sacrificing flavor. My fave is the Vegwich with sweet potato fries. Of course, anything I've ordered off the \"Happy side\" is always delicious also. Especially the Buff Chix. I wish they'd open one in Henderson!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious hipster food! You can order from the \"Healthy\" (calorie conscious) or \"Happy\" (extra delicious) side of the menu. Both sides are SO YUMMY! Love it here. Wish there was one closer to Henderson."}
{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast/lunch.  I got to try a few of the sandwiches, cookies, and a shake.  They have healthy choices but I didn't make a healthy choice, yet everything was so delish. Will certainly go back when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and helpful the person that took our order was nice and friendly as well Zia. She rocks gave us great advice about the food and the order was right the first time.  This was our first time here alll the way from California and we will be back. Thanks for having great workers in this place and great food. :)"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Looking for a healthy spot in sin city? THIS IS IT! Awesome variety for both breakfast and lunch. Juices and shakes are also spot on. Don't keep reading reviews, just go here, right meow!"}
{"text":"This place is so trendy! I loved the decor and design of the restaurant. The restaurant would do SO well in San Francisco... Very similar vibe. The menu has lots of healthy and \"happy\" food options. Very creative and diverse menu. The Cherry Popper burger, Filet O'Fire sandwitch, and the Cole chee were all a delicious filled success."}
{"text":"Service with a smile and the food is always FANTASTIC! I love the Cherry Popper Burger with a side of sweet potatoe fries. I would caution that if you want the egg ontop runny to always state the way you would like your egg cooked. I have gone in a few times and had the egg fried hard, instead of over easy. I don't always pay $12 burger for a burger, but when I do, I expect it to be cooked to order. ;) I When I brought the error to the attention of the server a new egg was made. The Cherry Popper is great and get ready to GET MESSY! The slaw provides some sauce which will in fact run down your hand and arm. The burger is always just as juicy! The sweet potatoe fries were fried to the excellent place of oh so crunch-EE and carmalized on the outside. Strawberry Lemonade is great but can be hit or miss and slightly watery. Don't forget to grab one of the three to four AMAZING cookies! You will NOT be disappointed!!!! Yummo! My daughter ALWAYS orders the Red Velvet Waffle and she LOVES all the fruit. So much so we always order extra. The staff is over the top AMAZING and accommodates our daughter's request. We truly appreciate the hospitality, award winning service and food. :D"}
{"text":"Oh SkinnyFats, how can I ever go wrong with this place? I probably don't even need to review skinnyfats because it's so popular here in Vegas, but I don't care. It's one of my favorite places here and I'm constantly craving it. I think my friends and family get sick of how much I suggest eating here!  First of all, the prices are great and you always leave very full. The employees are friendly and also offer great suggestions. I never wait too long for my food.  Second, the food is just amazing quality and so tasty. They have such a variety of menu options it's just awesome. If you're trying to eat healthy, they have something for you. If you're trying to indulge, they have something for you. I'm never unsatisfied.  I love my buff chix, blaze of thunder, cluck moo, and avocatoast, but there's so much more I want to try. We love this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Beyond the awesome food, their drinks and smoothies..omg. Their sodas are homemade and they're just so delicious. I always have to get one. Their smoothies are so refreshing and a great hangover cure, haha. Overall I just love this place."}
{"text":"I like the concept of this restaurant offering healthy and delicious unhealthy food. I ordered on the unhealthy side and got the cheesesteak which I didn't find all that good but was just your average cheesesteak smothered in melted buttered down cheese. The truffle fries were ok. I just wasn't impressed at all. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for the weekend came across this place on Instagram. We made our way over for lunch, and are so glad we ventured off the strip! My husband ordered a sandwich off the secret menu, which was a steal at $4.20. I had the Sweet Cheese Us with truffle fries and it was to die for!!! We loved this place so much we decided to come back again for breakfast on the way home. Had the wake n bacon and cinnutella French toast, and both were incredible. The staff is super friendly and helpful with suggesting menu choices. I will definitely come back here on our next trip to Vegas and will be crossing my fingers that they make their way to California in the meantime!"}
{"text":"Everything here is absolutely out of this world amazing, amazing service and hipster atmostohere really brings a modern taste and enginuity to the name of food game, 10/10 would hit again"}
{"text":"Yummy food from both sides of the menu ( the healthy side and the happy side.) We tried the More Cow Bowl, delicious. The meat was very tender and flavorful. The same goes for the Turnip Taco. The shrimp Tacodilla was delicious, too."}
{"text":"Why haven't I tried this place sooner?! The food is amazing here, whether you're in the mood to be healthy or indulge a bit. They also have a juice bar called the \"ColdPress Express\" for all your thirsty needs!  The menu has a \"healthy\" (skinny) side and a \"happy\" (FATS) side, both offering bomb selections. Honestly, both sides of the menu would make me happy because literally everything sounded good. I ate a couple of their entrees and damn, haven't had a bad thing yet.   Their food satisfies the stomach and the soul. Burgers here are delicious and the Chickawaffadopolis is poppin'. Now don't get me started on them sweet potato fries...I have a weakness for them and the ones here hit the spot; perfect combination of sweet, salty and heavenly.  Friendly service and the workers were nice too. Definitely a dope spot to grab some food and I'd eat here more often if I still lived in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food! All the employees had great customer service! I would come back again and again. The truffle fries reminded me of being in Dodger stadium. Great all around!"}
{"text":"Love this place, especially the bennies.  I have tried lots of different dishes and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great concept and great atmosphere!! Your cup you buy when you get a fountain drink-you bring with you next time for a cheaper price! That's cool! Location kinda sucks and the space inside is very tiny. 4 stars because they need a bigger space, only a few tables available, and just wish it wasn't so pricy to eat healthy!"}
{"text":"Delish! I cannot express how awesome this food is! There is something for everyone... bowls, soups, salads, and sandwiches... great juices snd smoothies too. Wish they would come to Texas!"}
{"text":"With 5 little ones this place was completely perfect! Something yummy for everyone! The cinnamon French toast was our kids favorite! We all ended up sharing & taste testing each other's dinners. The food came out super fast & the staff were so friendly & helpful! Loved it! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! This is my go to place when I have people visiting from out of town or brunch with the ladies. Wish they had more seating though.  You need to get there right as it opens so you can snag a table. It gets pretty packed. I especially keep my eyes open on Instagram for there delish specials. You have to be a foodie and have a great palette for that burst of flavors that you wouldn't think would go together but absolutely compliment in all of there dishes. It's a definite must try. These chefs really know what they're doing."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the menu it's simple and cute.  The first thing that threw me off was the soda it's not traditional soda I think it's home made and the flavors weren't very good.  The food was ok but not great it didn't really stand it as spectacular. I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Love the skinny and the not so skinny menu.  Everything that we ordered was very flavorful and the portions are huge.  I'm a coffee lover and their coffee tastes soooo good.  We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I will be definitely keep going back! I had a veggie sandwich with the portobello mushrooms, it was yummy, next time I will ask that they do not include the peppers, they were hot! I also had a celery, carrot, frozen yogurt shake, it was delish! The fries were yummy as well.    Next time I went there I decided to go for the pancakes with Brie, strawberries and balsamic dressing. Sorry guys, I will not be ordering this again, for me, that mix did not go well together. I usually do like mixing salty and sweet but this was a miss, at least for me. I think something broke in the kitchen that day because the fries did not have the same taste as the first time and my husband's meal (he ordered the same thing as the last time) was subpar.   I love this place anyway. Staff is friendly, the decor is awesome!! I would totally move in!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and although the food is good the service is lacking. The staff does not seem to pay attention to what's going on in the restaurant. Today when I ordered for me and my daughter, the girl at the register didn't ask if we wanted a drink and she was giving me my total bill. I had to ask her for drinks and then she only rang up one  instead of two, I asked her for drinks not a drink. Not sure if I will come back here to eat, the food is good but without the service it's nothing. Don't get me wrong, I understand there's always one that makes a good experience bad, but every time at this location there is always one."}
{"text":"Skinny Fats is my new favorite place in Las Vegas. Holy moly! Everything on the menu looked so good, but I'm a sucker for chicken and waffles. They were so delicious and the portions were huge! I cannot wait to come back to Vegas jut for Skinny Fats!"}
{"text":"I placed my order at 11:12 am. Upon placing my order on your online ordering site, it never told me a pick time or told me to check my email for a time. Just said \"thank you for placing your order\". Also, People who came in several minutes after me and ordered on the spot got their food before someone who ordered in advanced? Makes no sense for it to work that way. When I got there the place was pretty busy, but by the time I left It was close to empty and yet I'm the only one still sitting around waiting for food. Food was just okay too, and over priced. Didn't care for the wrap I got. Won't ever be back. It's too bad, cause I work near by and been wanting to try this place for months. But Now I see I am not missing out on that much, in my opinion."}
{"text":"At first we were suspiciois about this place. Its located in a busness center and there were no cars in the parking lot. However, when we walked in - it was like we went into another world. We loved this place! Someone spent a lot of time in the finest details. Very unique concept. Even our boys (who dont like eating out) were entertained by the salt and pepper shakers, cups, paintings on walls, etc. They even enjoyed their time there. The food was excellent as well. Very tasty and fresh. Couldn't say enough good things - must try this fun, fresh and quaint place!  This place is great if your on a diet or you are just trying to pig out, highly recommended."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats catered an event that I attended and I need to rave about the balsamic tofu - yeah, tofu  That was the SKINNY part.  It was super good.   FAT: The cheesecake was also delicious!  Would definitely go to the actual restaurant to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and i cannot stop thinking about it. I ordered the buffchix for me and the wifey to have as a sampler and she ordered the protein waffle with seared chocken and it was amazing. They serve it as a healthy dish which makes you feel less guilty about your craving for chicken and waffles. The buffchix is good but i saw someone next to me order the same thing but naked, id get the naked next time although the breading on the tenders were not overpowering. The cherry popper was good, had a tiny spice to it and was really sweet. If you are into that type of thing this is for you but it was a little to wet for my liking and the bread broke apart a little at the end. But the custom made juices and shakes put it over the top. I will definitely reccomend this to anyone. On a side note its a lil ways from the strip. Call for a cab about 5-10 mins before you finish"}
{"text":"Awesome place I'll just keep coming back and I bring my cup with me too.  For the most part I've been living happy. I've tried the bomb diggity and it's exactly how it's said. The chix on Broadway with avacado and bacon is a must.  Bring your cup don't be ashamed."}
{"text":"Perfect healthy, gluten-free option for a quick meal while visiting Vegas! Popped in here after a crossfit workout and it was a great spot to re-fuel. I loved the Naked Chix with basil-mango sauce and rice, and the CauliFIRE - roasted cauliflower with buffalo sauce - was a little undercooked for my liking but great!"}
{"text":"Wow, fabulous, amazing, awesome!!!!  We had a girls dinner tonight, and everything was wonderful! The staff is super friendly, full of suggestions, and very attentive.  They were busy and still smiling, and taking their time with each guest, in a good way! The ahi tacos, are amazing, they are filling, but make you want more!! My daughter who is a picky penny, had the Charlie Brown? It is a Shake with Nutella, banana and strawberries! It was delicious!  If you live in Vegas or are just visiting, skinny fats is a MUST stop! You will not be disappointed! I promise!!"}
{"text":"This place is cool. Expect to wait in line because they have outgrown their space. I got the \"snake eyes\" which is sirloin steaks on top of jalepeno cheddar biscuits with gravy and an egg on top. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding food -- so creative.  Great service.  Beautiful restaurant.  All four of us left extremely satisfied!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATs is EVERYTHING. This place never disappoints. I love the new location. There is more seating so you don't have to wait for a table. The food is always fresh and the presentation is always very nice. I've never had anything that I didn't like. Every time I go I order something different. The special sodas are also a nice touch. Def try SkinnyFats if you have never been."}
{"text":"First off the food here is really good!.  From the cherry popper burger to protein style waffles.  I honesty haven't had one bad meal at any of their locations.  My issue is that if you order your food to go you will be charged a \"green fee\" of $2.  According to the cashier that rung up my order it's their way of going green, similar to having to pay for your shopping bags in some states.  I understand there are costs with a paper bag or box but $2?!?  If you need to offset your costs raise the price of your food but don't throw in a hidden charge!  Check your receipt because no one will mention this unless you bring it up."}
{"text":"If you like that hipster vibe then go here. The  space is a bit small but its well designed. Its like a hip barn with an industrial design. They even have usb plug ins. The food is good. Nothing too much to rave about but great if you have health conscious friend.  Also ask for the waffapopodopolous i know its not correct but i think thats the name of the chicken n wAffs. Its in a secluded strip mall where its great to go to get away from all the popular areas.  Portion size is great and the staff is nice and unique meaning they all have their own swagger. My favorite thing was the cups they provided you. Theres a meter on the side with happy faces to tell you if you think youve had enough depending if you got their smoothies. Overall its a dope place. Considering Vegans love goin to the hip new spots at the moment."}
{"text":"Small clean place. Folks were cool. Food was super flavorful and yummy. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Place is ok. Girl at the counter was nice and helpful. Cool decor and a nice little outdoor area to eat. Ordered my sandwich with no mayo or tomato and it came out with mayo and tomato. Ordered the Italian flatbread and it was all tomato sauce. Won't be running back to eat here anytime soon. 3 stars for mainly because of the nice girl up front."}
{"text":"This is a legit place! I tried the Ahi Srirachi and Ahi Taco-san Tacos (unfortunately I got 2 of the Ahi Srirachi - they were ok) I also had the truffle fries (ok - Didn't taste fresh) and an Oatmeal Raisin Cookie (Amazing!). I think I ordered the wrong things, they had so many other tasty things, I've got to come back and give them another try!! They also do Breakfast all day which is a huge hit for me! I saw a S'Motherload Burrito that looked amazing, I've got to come back for!! I've posted pics of their menu and my meal."}
{"text":"Wow, so many amazing things to try on this massive menu!! I tried the Cherry Popper (no Banana peppers) (very tasty burger!!) and the Ahi-Sriracha Taco (Good). I also had a side of truffle fries (good). I also tried the Salted Carmel white chocolate chip cookie (Amazing!) I'll be back, there are so many other wonderful things I need to try!!"}

I like this kind of efficiency.  Portions are big, and juicy. I had the Smotherload, and was it a mother load...of deliciousness! There's cheese, pico, and tender steak pieces smothered with a delicious cheese on top. I won't get skinny off this, but I'll definitely come back for more!  P A R K I N G  Easy with the big lot."}
{"text":"Skinny Fats is totally unique. Always great food, always a long wait but totally worth it. They need to expand into Southern California!"}
{"text":"Really unique menus. One half of the menu is healthy food and the other half is not so much. All of it is really good and reasonably priced. I would go more often if it were closer to the northwest. Hard to swallow a 30 min drive for it. But if I'm in the area, I'll hit it up again!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and the service was fast. Portion sizes are a little big for lunch but I ate everything because it's so dang good!"}
{"text":"Triple FIVE stars... im so for real!!! Ill start with the FOOD!!!!!! OUT of this world DELISH... YOULL HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT OUT OUT!!!!!!... DELISH!!!! The staff is sooo amazing.... my server.. FONZIA,... yall she's the best... i let her pick my food.. now im STUCK!!!! SHE knows the menue with her eyes closed... ima be here every day yall... for real... yaaaaasssss FONZIA!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good people, good food! The ultimate post workout muscle feeding food!  Make sure to bring your appetite and a smile!"}
{"text":"We seriously LOVED this place!!  The staff was super fun and helpful, foooooood... yum!!!  The chicken and waffles were delicious.  Everything we ordered was on point.  We will be back anytime we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but I think it is hyped up a little. Some otems are good while others are mediocre."}
{"text":"Excellant Food !!! Great Service... unique design. I will be telling friends about this place."}
{"text":"I came in lunch time before the rush hour and it took 40 minutes for us to get our food and people who ordered way after us got their food before us. This never happened before even if I come rush hour and I always come here. I love their food and I'm always satisfied with everything, but yesterday was not the case."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, and for good reason. Their food for the most part is really tasty. The atmosphere is fun and the staff is alway pleasant. I really like the polarized menu, if you've got a friend who likes the healthy, they've got it, if you've got a friend who likes the sweet stuff, they got it. Prices are good too!"}
{"text":"Great food, and friendly staff. We came in with a big group for a birthday close to closing time and everyone was still very nice and not rushing us at all. Tony is always amazing and even bought our munchkins extra fries. Thanks for a great experience"}
{"text":"Grabbed an uber from our hotel around 8 o clock to hit this place up for dinner. Ii is in a hidden industrial center put well worth the extra drive to find it. Upon arrival, I realized that I had been here 2.5 years ago when I was in Vegas and just had not bookmarked it on yelp.   There was only 1 other group eating in the resturant when we arrived and by the time we finished there was four other groups. Good decor on the inside which keep things interesting, however in the night there is not much lighting and it is very difficult to see everything but the lit-up menu. Staff was friendly and helpful in their recommendations.   For food we ordered the Meltdown which was a half pend of beef with Caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, aioli and tomato between two sourdough pieces of bread, and then grilled.- So good. I also was able to share the Cherry popper burger which is a wee bi spicy with flavor nonetheless. I was not a huge fan of the coleslaw on it however, and next time might try a burger patty with other toppings. The third member of my party ordered the GOAT salad with Goat cheese, Filet Mignon, Infused pears, Walnuts and Strawberries over a bed of Spinach. A good salad, above ordinary but not the best I have ever had.   I give this place 5 starts for atmosphere/art work, the quick service, and the originality of their food (as well as tastiness We found it just as good as when I had previously tried it in the past, no wonder it has so many good reviews on yelp. Highly recommend that you give it a try."}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday for dinner and had to say I was quite impress with the food and service. I ordered the Zucc it with added chicken and the flavors were great. I also got the Cauli fire and was impressed as well. The fact that the fountain drink cups are reusable is awesome. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"This place is really cool. I like the way of how they differanciate their selection as happy side and healthy side. We stopped there before we're going back to LA for quick dinner. We got Zucc It, Buff Chix and Nice to Greek you. Buff Chix were ok but te sauce was little too much for my taste. Nice to Greek you was really delicious, it tastes great. I only didn't like Zucc It which was insanely spicy. We only took a few bites on that. It was enough spicy to make you drink two cups of water right after each bite. Overall, it was different experience for me since I usually eat on Strip. I probably dont come back tho."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is a really fun place to eat. The menu is divided into the Healthy side and the Happy Side. I have chosen from both sides, my husband and daughter only choose from the Happy side. The menu states the calorie count for the Healthy side, but not for the Happy side. Maybe if you knew how many calories the Happy side had you wouldn't choose much from that side. I don't know. Some people don't care about that when they go out. At any rate, they have something cool for everyone. Sometimes they have items that aren't on the menu. They are on the wall shown on the little TV screens where you wait in line to place your order. This is gourmet type food with non gourmet prices.  The entrees are $7-$14.  My husband likes their soda made with cane sugar. Some people get excited about that. They are interesting flavors, not just the regular coke and sprite type. I don't get the juice because I don't want to spend a lot of money on a drink. The cookies are very good.   In my opinion the best of the Healthy side is the STEAKation. Yummy...really and truly. Last time I ordered something called Pilgrimamedic (not sure of the title). It is just for November. Sooo good. Turkey ham on a waffle made of corn bread stuffing ingredients with fried green beans with some cranberry sauce with an over easy egg on top covered with some hollandaise type sauce and a few sugared cranberries. Wow!  My taste buds were very happy. Not sure what side that was from. Probably the Happy side. I just discovered that they have the breakfast menu all day. I'm going to try that next time.   The decor is interesting. They have TVs which doesn't make me happy. Apparently some people cannot survive without TV every waking hour. The staff are very pleasant and they seem happy which is good. They have some booths, bar seating near the kitchen and a huge table in the middle that multiple parties can sit at with chunky barstools that are hard to move and not extremely comfortable. I'd rather sit at a booth, but they don't have many of those. They also have a little outdoor enclosed eating area. They do have some free standing tables with chairs near the front windows which are not very inviting or cosy.   All in all... this is a fun place to go when you don't want to spend too much money and you have people who have different taste desires. We bring out of towners here when they visit."}
{"text":"Chick-a-waff-a-dopolis .......is all you need to know. I drove by this place on my way home from another favorite place on the area and decided to stop for breakfast. The outside doesn't look much like a restaurant, you really need to know what your looking for, but since I had read about it on yelp, I knew it was there. The place is small about the size of your average subway shop but nicely designed, modern tables, modern chairs and newly designed classic meals. The menu features healthy and not so healthy options so there's surely something on the menu for everyone, it seems that we were there during fat hour. We ordered the phatty Philly with truffle fries (good) and the chicken & waffles from the secret menu  (good)  but the (wow) factor was missing. Still, a good meal for the price. Service was wonderful everyone here is very attentive and very friendly, if they were any more friendlier they'll be competing with the neighboring business.  This is a good concept  and I'm glad someone noticed that there are two kinds of people.....yelpers and non yelpers. I'm sure I'll be back, it seems that I drive by this place to often. It may not be on the strip but is right by the strippers.  #chick-a-waff-a-dopolis (is the secret word)"}
{"text":"Not a whole lot on the menu but it's different and pretty good tasking.  Takes a little time to get your order but worth waiting for.  A little  pricey.  Very small dining area.  Almost self serve."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem that is not so hidden any more!  The quality of the food and the service you receive by the staff is what sets this place apart.  I've been coming here for the last two years and everything I have ordered has been delicious!  Honestly you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I just tried the Cherry Popper burger which comes with peppers, slaw and a fried egg on hawaiian bread.  It was sooo good!  The burrito with filet mignon and sausage is awesome.  Great smoothies and coffee!  I will be back each time i'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This strangely-named, compact, counter-service restaurant has on their menu a variety of interesting dishes--breakfast options, sandwiches, and bowls as well, inspired by flavors from all different cuisines! For every menu category, there's a \"healthy\" side (which includes calorie listings) and a \"happy\" side (which does not). So there's indeed something for everyone!  Having just gotten off the plane at LAS, I stopped in to try the Pimp Shrimp, a shared plate of tempura shrimp over a hollowed-out cucumber \"boat,\" topped with pico de gallo and drizzled with a cilantro sauce. The flavors were quite nice, though I found that the pico made the shrimp lose its crispiness and warmth. I also had the STEAKation sandwich, which consisted of shaved NY strip steak, arugula, tomato, onion, and horseradish sauce on a wheat bun--the flavors of the tender, thinly-sliced meat along with the crispness of the vegetables was simply delicious! On every table, there was also a bottle of black pepper ketchup, which had a nice smoky-spiciness to it--a perfect complement to the beef. Every sandwich also comes with a side, and I got the cauliflower rice, a surprisingly flavorful yet simple plate of riced cauliflower. Nice!   For the good value and tasty dishes in a casual setting, I'd definitely recommend a visit to SkinnyFATS in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came for the first time, well after the lunch rush (3pm) so there was no wait.  I can see how parking and ordering may become hectic at peak hours.  From its location and size, you'd be convinced it was a commercial office space in its past life.  Though it is 'cozy,' the lay out proves the space is used optimally, and the artistic details make for a unique setting.  Order at the counter, then grab a number and a seat.  The menu provides an interesting take and variety on [namely] American cuisine.  Me and my late lunch date tried something from the 'healthy' side and the 'happy' side.  The Slow Boat to China is essentially a chicken & cucumber salad, with a few other veggies, nuts, and a glaze that most closely resembled eel sauce.  It is presented as a boat (thus the name), and tasted like a California Roll.  I enjoyed it, though questioned how 'healthy' it really was on account of the sauce.  I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries, which were prepared to a crisp--and delicious! From the 'happy' side, we ordered the Benedict Burger with truffle fries.  It was rather well done, but still juicy, considering.  I am a sucker for eggs on a burger, so I liked it before I even tried it.  It had the usual veggie fixins plus avocado.  Not a burger I absolutely must have again, but a tasty, well made burger.  Likewise, the accompanying truffle fries were pretty good, but nothing different from any truffle fries I've tried before.  Granted, we were not so adventurous with our selections; We came more for necessity than foodie experimentation [and left very satisfied].  Next time, I will give one of their Philly Cheesesteak options a spin, as well as their loaded fries.  The photos and descriptions look amazing.  The portions are pretty large/definitely shareable.  Bonus points for flavored ketchup options! The jalapeno one was my favorite.  Service was great.  Staff is friendly.  I would definitely take friends and family here."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS was absolutely amazing and very much worth the drive! The TeriyAHi was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of teriyaki sauce. The Swinentology was more simple but still tasted great. The SkinnyFATS Punch was very fresh, I had to get another one! On top of it all, all the employees were very kind and energetic"}
{"text":"Went for the first time last weekend. Not what I expected, much better. Lil bit of a learning curve ref the skinny/fat thing but think I got it!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great heathy and yummy options.  Plenty of veggie and vegan options as well.  Great fresh brewed tea.  Favorites are cranburkey, vegwich, and mean bean.  Sweet potato fries are a must."}
{"text":"This place is really solid with lots of good options and rotating specials.  Half the menu is healthy options, and the other side is the not so heathy options. They always have good fresh brewed teas.  It's a bit slammed around lunch time, but with options for everyone, I understand why.  I have a bunch of favorites depending on my mood.  You won't really go wrong here as long as you aren't in a hurry."}
{"text":"Very good food. Choose from the healthy side or the happy side!!! :DD both times I have been here, always a long line but its totally worth the wait!!! Their slaw chee side dish is super delicious! Next time I go, dying to try their slow boat."}
{"text":"I love this place! I stopped here for lunch with a large group of colleagues and was able to walk right up, order and seat myself within minutes. I ordered a buffalo chicken bowl with a soda. Starting with the soda, they have really cool re-useable dishwasher safe cups that are sturdy and durable. I kept mine, flew home with it and gifted it to one of my kids who was stoked on the emoji design. While there I had several refills of their cream soda which was delicious! My friends kept stealing sips! Within about 10 minutes my food came out and it was delicious, I threw some hot sauce on there for extra spice and made it just a touch too spicy, but kept quenching my thirst with soda ( I eventually moved on to black cherry soda). My meal was a lot for me, I couldn't finish it all-the portion sizes are ample! I was dining with a vegan friend and there were tons of options for her to choose from, I sampled them all and they were all yummy! The bathrooms are clean and spacious. Best of all, this wonderful food is very reasonably priced, but quality-for-value meal I've had in a long time, if not ever."}
{"text":"I love the innovative selections that they offer, but I was not wowed this time around. I ordered the tempura ahi taco and the tempura cauliflower taco,plus truffle fries. I had had the fries once before and was disappointed, but thought maybe they skimped on the seasoning last time. No such luck. Some of the blandest truffle fries around again. I loved the flavors of the ahi taco, but the dish was very hard to eat. The cauliflower taco was a nice idea, but the overpowering flavor was lemon, and not much to balance it. Also hard to eat, but some of that could have been corrected with smaller chunks of cauliflower. Will go back to ordering the tu-nuts the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price and they offer military discount.  The pizza may seem a little small, but the portions are based on quality and health."}
{"text":"Your food is a gastronomic party of pure excellence. I care what I eat especially when going out to a restaurant. The experience needs to be a treat and needs to make you smile, SkinnyFATS you delivered! We went for brunch and enjoyed every fresh and healthy bite.......will recommend to all and you are top on our list!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a class and relied on Yelp to quickly find a place to go for lunch, and we were happy to find this place. Super cool vibe and the girl that took our order was so nice. My friend had a flatbread and a juice and I had the Smoke in a Bowl. It was different than what I expected when I ordered, but really good."}
{"text":"Very overrated. And its sooo small in there,tight and crowed. idk maybe it was the time i went @11am Saturday. For about two weeks I was planning on going there for the first time, and being blown away by the food. I mean every day I was looking at pictures from their menu online with my mouth watering. But when i got there it was not what i expected, not all it had been hyped up to be.The pictures online do the food justice, food was mediocre nothing special . I ordered the chix on broadway with side salad, the truffle fries, and the slow boat to china. Not at all impressed. And my friend ordered the filet on fire and had nothing to say about it. Oh yeah i asked them what did thy think about it and they said \" it'll make a turd!\""}
{"text":"I just wanted to write the 1000th review so I figured I'd write an update. This place is great. Still love their food. Staff is cool and the liquid defense is an awesome juice!!!! Congrats in your 1000th review guys. That's impressive!"}
{"text":"Flawless food, beautiful garden-y decor - this is a must for every Vegas trip from now on!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to go for breakfast that was unique. I didn't want to eat so much I might explode and love having options that are healthy, so my search narrowed drastically off the strip. We found SkinnyFats by fate!   The location is strange, in an industrial park, but once inside you can hardly tell. The wait staff was awesome, super friendly and helpful. We learned healthy options on the left and other options to the right.  I was immediately drawn to the protein waffle with fresh fruit and turkey bacon (although turkey bacon made we worried). Overall it was fabulous and I ended up loving the turkey bacon!  My husband ordered chicken and waffle. The waffle was standard issue. The only critique was the chicken. Extra spices would have kicked it up a notch. Chicken was a bit bland without.  Overall, we enjoyed the stop!"}
{"text":"Regular tasting food overall. Cute idea for a restaurant. So much potential for a better menu and execution of dishes. So much mayonnaise on the Tu nuts and ahi taco san. Protein waffles taste like cardboard. Kale salad is pretty good. The service is pleasant. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, perfect for lunch or casual dinner date, clever sayings on the door and menu, great service, great menu, fantastic food, balanced portion sizes. I ordered the meltdown, ahi taco, and lemon blueberry Cookie. Every bite was a perfect bite."}
{"text":"The oxymoron name is clever. There is no messing around here. Items available for all types of diets. Want to keep it healthy? There is something for that. Do you eat gluten free stuff or are you vegan? Well, you're in luck! The young lady, Jocelyn working the register told me there is something for everyone here. She was very nice and was able to give some insight on the items.   Since it was my first time I had to go with the Cherry Popper (you never will forget your first time, unless it wasn't done right, and I'm sure if it wasn't cooked to your liking they will make you another). Burger topped with an egg and some coleslaw, plus a little spice to give it a kick. I love the taste of a fried egg on top of burgers. Since I'm not real fan of French fries, I decided to go with the cauliflower rice. I was trying to balance out my meal and make part of it vegan. The rice was so delicious. They mix it with some garlic. You will need to try it.   I was able to sneak a bite of the bacon and sausage from my bro's plate. He swore it was the best bacon he ever had. I thought it was good. I could not leave without trying some of their cookies. The cookies are on display next to the register. My will power was non-existent that morning. The salted caramel and snicker-doodle was recommended. I decided to go with it. The cookies are a bit pricey at $3/each but they were well worth it.   The restaurant is easy to find since they have a huge billboard alongside the road. You can't miss it, right off Dean Martin Dr., located in an industrial park. The place is small inside. Think of a small starbux with lots of tables. Not ideal for large groups. I did notice one group of six and they were comfortable. Most of the tables sit 4 and a few sit 2. There is also a long counter near the entrance to sit and enjoy your food if you're riding solo. Water is available next to the cookies.   I can't wait for my next trip to Vegas, so I can eat here again. Give them a try. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I like the concept of having the choice between healthy and happy food. We probably just chose some of the wrong things on the menu. My husband has the chicken and waffles which was fine but nothing fantastic. I had the Nutella French toast. Too much cinnamon for my taste and the Nutella has chili flavoring in it which I didn't care for. The place was busy and the service was very good."}
{"text":"Best food ever! Everything is amazing and the service is good! I have not had anything bad here. Im always trying something new and everytime i do, its amazing! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This SkinnyFats is located in a busy Costco complex but there are plenty of parking in front of the store so that's a plus. The interior is airy with a good amount of seating; the decoration is rustic and hip. The menu has 2 separate sides: healthy and happy (unhealthy). Both sides have plenty of delicious choices from a simple mixed green salad to a fully carbs loaded pasta bowl. My fiancé and I got \"Nice to Greek you\" and \"Fresh Morning\" and they were both pretty good, except for the \"Fresh Morning\" was a bit dry and could use a little more sauce. My favorite part about SkinnyFats is that they have Birch Beer as one of their fountain drink selections. This drink is kinda similar to root beer but better and it is so hard to find in Vegas. Overall, I rate this place 4 stars and will most likely come back."}
{"text":"The food and service here just get better and better. Their team reached out to me after part of my previous meal didn't pass muster. I went back and tried something a bit simpler and I was so happy I did. I stuck with the buff chix bowl with truffle fries and their tenders are juicy, flavorful and just all around a great lunch item. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas for our anniversary week, and stopped here after hiking in the Red Rock mountains. Man, this place was awesome! I'm gonna jump right to the food. I had the Cranburkey (turkey burger with cranberry and other deliciousness) and it was so yummy. Juicy, topped properly, very good. I also ordered sweet potato fries and the \"Beet It\" juice. Everything was tasty and seasoned perfectly from the burger to the juice. Seriously, that juice was delicious and refreshing with the right amounts/ratios of the different juices.   I think that one of the draws to this spot is that there is something for everybody. Whether you're a herbivore, carnivore, omnivore or an I-eat-what-I-want-when-I-wanna-vore, there are hearty, tasty, delicious options. Great, great, great"}
{"text":"SkinnyFats offers a robust menu including both \"Healthy\" and \"Happy\" options in each category (i.e., appetizers, salads, sandwiches) and identifies gluten-free and vegan choices. The portions are ample and the flavor rewarding.  The staff at this location was friendly and helpful, making us feel very welcome."}
{"text":"I love skinnyFATS! Their food is delicious and they have a very good selection of dishes that will appeal to a large demographic of people. I have been here several times and have never been disappointed. They have both and outside and inside seating area so that you can take your pick depending on the weather."}
{"text":"Really interesting menu.  Inexpensive for the quality. Friendly and yummy.  Great sides menu.  Need GPS to find."}
{"text":"ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS PLACE IS FANTASTIC!!!!! WOW! The chicken was excellent and super juicy! The burgers are great and so was the chicken salad on the cucumber! If you come during lunch be prepared to sit along the window or outside."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance. Ordered the Hangover Juice and hubby ordered a lemon blueberry sugar cookie.  Shoooooot. We were just going to grab and go but the environment made us sit and enjoy it. Plus, the cookie had this delicious flavor at the end that made you SIT THE EFF DOWN. It was buttery with an amazing finish."}
{"text":"Great food, great crew!!! The menus are delicious and the options are plenty. This place never fails, it will fill you up and you will always leave happy!!"}
{"text":"Been to Skinny fats a few times on Warm Springs and Durango.  Super friendly and great customer service.  I've liked all my meals there.  The sweet potato fries are so dang good. Best by far. I never get the same thing.  I found the truffle fries taste like just French fries.  Not much of a fried food eater.  But sure am for those sweet potato fries.  Can't wait to try what's next."}
{"text":"We visit this location often because it's closest to our home. Today's visit was absolutely horrible. While in line, the couple in front of us were having trouble with their card because the skinnyfats card system was offline. It took them about 10 minutes to complete their order and the apology given was very dry. We almost decided to go somewhere else which would've saved me from the awful food we were served. The server brought out our food in to-go bags when we told the cashier we would be dining in. She had our food plated and brought it back out to us. My breakfast potatoes were undercooked and bland and my husband's chicken and waffles were bland too. It's the first time I left 90% of my food uneaten and walked out a restaurant. We won't be back for awhile."}
{"text":"First visit, and it was amazing and delicious! The staff is very friendly! Will definitely be back! There was quite a rush when we first got there, and they handled it very well the line moved fairly quickly, and we didn't wait to so for our food :)"}
{"text":"I love this place but I'm REALLY disappointed that they discontinued their smoothies. They were my favorite part of eating there. Fresh smoothies with great unique flavors and now they are gone. My favorite was the Delightful Cucumber and secondly the Ginger Cinnaps and my husband and kids loved the Charlie Brownie flavor. I've seriously considered contacting the owners to ask them to bring them back or give me their recipes for them to make at home.  The 3 star I gave is solely because they stopped serving the smoothies which was the thing that brought me in the most despite them being pricey smoothies, it was worth it to me.   But it you're tired of me complaining about that...I do enjoy the Buff Chix meal. Their fries are amazing. Wasn't a fan of the Zucc It. Cookies are also huge and delicious. Their sandwiches are amazing as well. Good large portions. They always have friendly staff and are willing to make substitutions for you in the meals. The atmosphere is clean, fun and enjoyable. I'll change my rating to 5 stars when they bring those smoothies back!"}
{"text":"My Bestie took me here for the Very First time... And All I can Yum! Yum! Yum!!! Everything was so good and with all the nutritional information for everything it's easy to still eat healthy here we tried multiple things and every item was so full of flavor and prepaid very well... And also loved the outdoor patio atmosphere... Very cool and inviting... I think I just found my new healthy eats close to my house!!! Awesome Job Skinny Fats"}
{"text":"Really solid concept, I love the look and feel of the place. Healthy options and happy options both side by side, all look really well put together. I went with the happy option cherry popped with truffle fries. Well put together with quality ingredients and cooked perfectly. The truffle fries were delicious too (especially with the house peppercorn sauce!). Without a doubt I'll be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Skinny Fats is a really neat spot and I am so glad they opened a location near our place. I have gotten most everything on the \"Healthy\" Menu, and have indulged several times on the \"Happy\" Menu (Ok maybe more than several times ;))   I have to say that I don't feel like I am eating \"healthy\" food because all of the items on the menu are so tasty and don't feel like they are missing cheese or butter aioli. However, when I eat the \"happy\" menu, while I am very happy I also feel very heavy! haha. But what I love about this place is that when I am on a mission to get healthier, we can still dine here and my husband can order off either menu and doesn't feel like I am forcing him onto my diet.   The only thing I can say is that I don't think the location is as good as Dean Martin, but the lines are definitely shorter which is a plus! And I think the menu could be enlarged and the prices reduced. Case in point, the buffalo cauliflower is very tasty and healthy, but it is over $6 for a handful of Cauliflower. Compared with an ahi taco for a similar price which is way more filling and made with more expensive ingredients. I would suggest more consistency in their prices. However, this is a good restaurant and I will continue to enjoy it there!"}
{"text":"NOTE: I originally had two reviews written out about my first and second visits here with the good and the bad. After talking to my Elite CM Nate, he gave me some good advice \"don't post a review after the first visit and just because you had a bad experience - give them a second chance because everybody can have a bad day\" and he's right. My first visit here the Strawberry Lemonade was terrible but after I left my review and I returned, it was perfect! So I made the decision to delete those previous reviews and write a fresh new one after I've returned multiple times as I do love giving second chances, so here it goes!   Skinny Fats has a great environment, even when they are busy an employee always says hello and welcome as you enter. There are times where the line is a bit of a wait but the food is so worth it! At this location online ordering is not available which is a bummer if you're looking for convenience but you can call it in ahead of time and pick it up for to-go! I've had a few things off both sides of the menu and surprisingly enough I've only enjoyed the meals I've had from the Healthy side so far. I did try their ColdExpress \"juice bar\" as well and for $10 I was still hungry afterwards which was disappointing but that just proves I'm not a juicing person but at least I tried! They have a secret menu on their iPad and sometimes share the items on Facebook which is fun, I love the Secret Punch drink! So my point is, give this place a try! And don't leave a review without experiencing it more than once is great advice."}
{"text":"Its actually kind of funny how their name suggests pretty much is what on their menu. They have a healthy side and a fatty side. My friend and I have been hearing a lot about this place and been dying to find a time to try it one day.   Luckily, our first chance as at a Yelp charity event where SkinnyFats participated and offered a few items on their menu as samples. Those samples were enough to make us want to go try the real place even more. Everything was so good ! Samples of chix on broadway sliders on hawaiian sweet bread, ahi tacos, two juices, and other things.   Chance finally came when two friends from Cali came into town and we were lookin for a lunch place. To my surprise, the place was actually quite small. I could almost swear i saw pictures, somewhere, where it showed a bigger place. i must be dreaming .... When we came, it was lunch time and was packed, but luckily, by the time we ordered, two tables cleared out and we got a place to sit.   As with most foodies, each get a different thing, and try each others food, and so we did...  Phatty Philly w/ Truffle Fries - This was what i had ordered. Steak, sauteed onions, peppers, portobello mushrooms, blue cheese & steak sauce on a hoagie bun. The ABSOLUTE FIRST THING you notice after taking a bite, \"OH MY GOD THATS A LOT OF BLUE CHEESE!!!\" wow what a punch in the face with the strong blue cheese sauce. I didnt expect it to be that strong. It actually covers a lot of the other ingredients flavors. Its great if you are a blue cheese lover, but being someone who not exactly like it nor do i hate it, it was surprising. Aside from that, the steak was super tender. great quality meat, juicy, and cooked to perfection. Next time, i would ask for some grilled onions and jalepenos too and switch out the blue cheese for something lighter like a provolone.   The fries were nice and crispy. Finally a place that doesnt drench their fries in truffle oil. Its still noticeable but it doesnt kick you in the mouth. EAT IT WITH THE JALEPENO KETCHUP ! delicious !   Chix on Broadway - One of the things tried before, and fell in love with (at the yelp event). Breaded chicken breast on a brioche bun with cheddar, lettuce, bacon, tomato, red onion, and lemon aioli. Though bun is different, the sandwich is still as amazing as the sampler. One of the very few places who can actually cook a chicken breast and still keep it tender and juicy ! Lemon aioli sauce gives it a bright flavor melding the entire sandwich together. For some odd reason, red onions were more spicy than sweet. My friend took them out. She wasnt a fan on bacon either. MUST TRY !   Cheeseburger Benedict - 1/2 pound angus buger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar, avocado, red onion, and a fried egg. This was what my friend ordered. I'm not a fan of burgers but apparently the burger was so huge, it fell apart while he was eating. He pretty much went fork & knife for the rest of the burger. At least the person who ordered it was happy? XD  Drunken Gypsy Toast - Came here after dinner with my friend who thought this place had more desserts. Apparently she saw the sunday sundaes. Oops? We shared this gypsy toast as a dessert. Topped with fresh cut fruit (strawberries, bananas, and blueberries), whipped cream, a side of syrup, and a few things of bacon. Her nor i being a fan of bacon, that immediately went to another friend. Upon first glance, the toast reminded me of the McD's hotcakes. just by the sheer shape and look. The toast was nice and thick but fluffy. Good breakfast item (as what it was designed for) lol o well. still good nonetheless.   Overall, great place in an awkward location yet still so busy, and popular. Would love to come back to try other things, like the acai bowl !"}
{"text":"MUCH BIGGER LOCATION and nicer too :D well same design overall but the seating arrangement is nice. I love the idea of having an outdoor seating (even though its getting quite cold now) but it would be great when its like.. mid 70s low 80s ! *heart* haha they have a good amount of seating (much more and spacious compared to original location) and also a huge table for those single go-ers or if you just like the bar height style seating !   coming to this location, its not a first time experience. but considering how close it is and convenient, my friend and I had determined to try something new every time we come here :D   my favorite item - chix on broadway - Breaded chicken breast, BLT, cheddar, red onion & lemon herb aioli on brioche w/side - im actually not sure if this changed or it was maybe a 1 time thing or chef difference.... the chicken was bigger (not complaining) but a bit dryer and not as juicy and flavorful as i remembered...   truffle fries... again i think it my be a location or 1 time thing... first time i ordered this, the fries were a bit soggy, and not as fresh/crisp. still love the availability of the jalepeno ketchup hahah XD   chik-a-waff-a-dopolis - fried chicken tenders over buttermilk waffle - the fried chicken tenders were seasoned really nicely (similar to the chicken in chix on broadway) but the waffle was a bit of an upset. yeah its big but too firm. not as light and crispy as i had expected a waffle to be like. the  wrap supastar - Chicken, egg whites, avocado, pico & spinach in a WW tortilla w/cajun cilantro lime yogurt - one of the first lighter menu items ive tried..... and it is definitely lighter ... in terms of calories (i think) and flavor... a bit bland actually... the cajun cilanto lime yogurt is not enough to eat with the entire wrap.   finally got to sit outside for once but unfortunately it was getting cold (jacket weather) and they couldnt figure out how to turn on the gas space heaters (tip - low on propane.... Lol)  after tryin the healthier side.. i might be a bit more biased than i already was towards the non... healthy side hahah XD !"}
{"text":"Words can't explain how amazing this places, and everything from desert to main entrées to even the water is perfect. Worth going out of your way. Definitely coming every time I visit Vegas, it's worth it for sure."}
{"text":"This place is great! The quesadilla was amazing. Our son loved his chicken & waffles. Husband got the burger with the fried egg & devoured it. I got the chicken sandwich and it was excellent. Nice friendly staff! Fountain drinks are local."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is so cool! The restaurant has a youthful and nice vibe, and the food menu is awesome. I always order from the Healthy side, but it tastes like I'm ordering from the Happy side. I haven't had anything from the Happy side... i can't imagine how good it is because the Healthy side is great.  The only thing I don't like is how small it is. The restaurant is always packed, and the seating is first come first serve. So people are practically fighting for tables."}
{"text":"Well this was a VERY PLEASANT surprise ~    This is a bit out of the way for me, coming from Henderson however I thought the food really good and the girl who took my order was lovely and quite helpful.    I didn't realise it was an order at the counter and your food is delivered to your table kind of place ~     I ordered the Shrimp  Tacodillo , 2 tacos per order so I had one shrimp & one chicken both were FAB!!! They are prepared cooked in siracha which I thought could be to HOT  and the girl taking my order offered for the sauce to be on the side. The sauce turned out to be spicy  & sweet. It was really nice~    DEFINATELY if I am in the area I wouldn't hesitate to return ~ also the cauliflower rice which is actually cauliflower with buffalo sauce and a delish dipping sauce. Wasn't to spicy for me however my girlfriend about went up in flames after her first bite ~"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, I suggest the Chix on Broadway. But, the service needs a little work -- only due to the high volume of customers in contrast to the shack 's setup. It took me thirty minutes to order and once I did order, there was nowhere to sit. However, the staff is full of plenty congenial characters. Plain and simple, the ordering process is akin to Smashburger. The only difference is you're cared for more closely at this establishment. A waitress here named Ashley said that they're opening a new location, though she didn't know where specifically, so perhaps the setup at the new location will be better."}
{"text":"Came here with a group and it worked out beautifully. The place is SMALL, but simple and clean.There was construction on Dean Martin when we went, so it was a bit hard to find, but Google maps navigator called out the turn perfectly. Plenty of parking in the office park.   The service was great...Happy people, very helpful, fast & efficient, and no issues with special orders or drink refills. (no alcohol here...just regular soft drinks and tea/coffee) Even the \"fat\" side of the menu is healthy.   We had 12 people in our group, ordered 15 things off the menu, and every single person loved what they ordered. We all loved the truffle fries and sweet potato fries. Fast fresh healthy food at VERY reasonable prices. What more can you ask?"}
{"text":"Skinny FATS is a casual restaurant that has a good design and a nice outdoor seating area. Actually, I am a food lover who likes all kind of things, healthy and not so much. That's what makes this place so great for me. They have a menu to please. The left side of the menu is full of healthy options, including whole wheat protein waffles with rosemary chicken and sugar free syrup, while the right side is the \"happy\" menu that has a richer version (fried chicken and waffles with maple syrup).  Don't come here if you're looking to have a soda with your meal, cause they don't carry any soda products. They have cold pressed juice (a little pricey but so good) and they have milk shakes.  I had the Drunken Monkey Cakes which came with glazed bananas, whipped cream, marshmallows and chocolate chips with a side of bacon. So delicious..."}
{"text":"Always delicious - happy or healthy. You've gotta try this place. One of the only in Las Vegas with \"character.\" My favorite so far is the steak sandwich with jalapeño ranch sauce. Forget the name, but check it out (with sweet potato fries of course)"}
{"text":"I came at a time when it was completely dead. And I mean dead. I had tried coming once but it was too packed. I was talking to the server and he said that usually lunch brunch and some dinners are busy. Durin 3-6 is when they are usually not busy.  Server recommend chix on Broadway. It's a chicken sandwich but dang is it good. The menu is creative in how it balances healthy with happy. It's super hip inside and I dig it."}
{"text":"This place tries to do too much. Curious combinations that do not work and just taste weird. Their more traditional items are nothing special but at least tolerable. By far, my worst meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"3rd time here. 1st was amazing, 2nd was disappointing. Happy to see the got their beer & wine license back. This trip was good but not great. Our order was wrong (brought eggs scrambled vs over medium), forgot my beer.  They recovered quickly but again good not great. Food is pretty good, service could be more consistent."}
{"text":"Been going here since their first location on dean Martin. And sometimes it is so good. Amazing innovative food and cute decor and good service. They are great about allowing me to substitute to fit a vegetarian diet. However it is so inconsistent. Sometimes it amazing but sometimes it's not edible at all. Tonight I ordered delivery and my sandwiches were soaked in oil. Normally it's a nice crispy warm buttered bread. But this was falling apart it was so oily. It's disappointing when you are craving it but feel it's a gamble to order and spend the money if you don't know it's going to amazing or end up in the trash.  Edited to add.   The manger reached out to me and offered a credit. Quick customer service. I have since ordered it 4 more times with a note to to light oil and it's been on point every time. Mention your concerns to them and they will do their best to  accommodate"}
{"text":"Where do I began... This place is awesome. It has great foods and it will make you try new things. Im very picky but if the food is presented right ill try it. The customer service is great. Im a huge fan. I don't have a favorite meal but if it helps i have yet to have anything there they I did not fully enjoy. Oh wait im not a huge fan of their truffle fries but ill eat them."}
{"text":"I love this place. I ate healthy, while my boyfriend ate happy. We had excellent breakfast. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was delicious! I had the Chix on Broadway w/o onions and sweet potato fries. The sandwich was outstanding and the sweet potato fries actually had a taste. This was money well spent."}
{"text":"Omg this food is so good. I got the TATS with salad. Got super full and it was very healthy. Wish this place was closer to me."}
{"text":"Ate there again yesterday and took my friend who has major dietary issues! Everyone had a great meal! Place was packed as usual !"}
{"text":"Went to this place based on the reviews and thought they had pretty decent food.  All the food we ordered, we enjoyed. I didn't give it 5 stars because the food wasn't to die for.  I will definitely return and try some of their other foods."}
{"text":"My husband ordered The Classic Burger with the Breakfast Potatoes and I ordered the Cherry Popper with Truffle Fries. I didn't get to try the Classic Burger but my husband said it was really good. I did get to taste the Breakfast Potatoes and that was really good and I don't normally care for Breakfast Potatoes. The Cherry Popper was really good, I just wasn't ready for how spicy it came out to be. I knew it was spicy but not as spicy as it was. My first bite & I already had to drink an entire water bottle. No lie! & I love spicy food. The Cherry Popper was still super good tho! Oh, & the Truffle Fries!! Super good. Will definitely be eating here again and making it a usual thing."}
{"text":"Just ordered my first delivery order!!!  This is the best.  I had the Slob Cobb, which was a great portion and very fresh.  I also had the meaty bun, snack size, wish this were a full size burger.  It was delicious.  They forgot an item on my delivery, but they came very quickly once I called to let them know.  Will certainly be back to try the other items on the menu.  Great customer service and friendly."}
{"text":"I just recently found out that there's a skinny fats restaurant close by to where I live. This is my first time coming here. The food is great, but the fucking service sucks, they didn't give me my drink that I ordered, I inform an associated and still yet they're taking another 30 minutes, and I still don't have it. I work in the kitchen as a kitchen manager, and I see a lot of mistakes from all this associates are doing, but it's not my business, I don't work here. My friend warned me about this place but I didn't believe because everyone has a different perspective, but now I see what he was trying to warn me about. I love skinny fats but, the service sucks so badly, I rather drive to the other side of town."}
{"text":"So overrated food is overly dressed, overly fried and under flavored. I literally do not get the hype at all. Maybe because people love thinking they are eating healthy?! I have tried it here now a few times and tried both sides of the menu and all I can say is I have absolutely no desire to come back and hate that my friends think this place is decent."}
{"text":"First I want to start by saying that I actually like the food at SkinnyFATS, this is more about the service. This was not the first time I've had an issue with a to go order at this location. If you're eating there, you should be fine.   Had a 15 minute drive home and called to place an order for pickup. Clarissa answered the phone and asked to place me on hold for a minute. Pretty standard so far. As I continue to drive, I think to myself \"geez I've been on hold for a long time.\" Before you know it I've arrived at SkinnyFATS and they still have not come back on the phone. I check my phone and I see it's already been over a 15 minute phone call. Wonderful!   As I drive past the front door, I see that the store is pretty busy, but not a single soul in line! That's pretty infuriating to put it mildly. I consider going inside while still on hold, and getting in line to place an order and tell them \"seems it was faster to drive 15 min here and order in person instead of calling in an order!\" Ultimately, I decide to just leave as I wouldn't even enjoy my meal from here today.   As I pull out of the plaza and I'm about to hang up, Clarissa comes back on the phone \"thank you for holding, can I get your name for the order?\" I say \"no thanks! That was pretty long hold. I just drove by your store and there wasn't a single person in line! So that's pretty upsetting.\" To which she replies \"there must have been some mix up in the order of the phone calls.\" Seems more likely I was forgotten about on hold, cuz how many phone calls were \"mixed up\" ahead of me for 15 minutes???  I end up hanging up and drive home hungry and upset. Not sure if I'm ever going back to this SkinnyFATS."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our last visit and we were so happy we did. The service was great and the food was delicious. I like their bussiness model, half \"skinny\" healthy options, half \"fats\" comforting delicious options. I had the sweet cheezus  (cheese steak) and it was absolutely delicious. I took half back to the room an it was even yummy cold later.  Salmon boat was good and refreshing, could use some wasabi. Boyfriend enjoyed his stirfry. I really enjoyed their own brand of jalapeno ketchup, jalatcha :) we'll be sure to jalatcha next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"First & last time , husband has been raving about this place talking about good reviews and all , I found it very costar phobic ! He ordered the Ahi tacos and I ordered the Cranburky  turkey burger it was over done dry and I ordered a side of fruit that came with it and 1st glance the melon was old and  soggy I asked for a fresher one and the girl told me that's  all they have if if like something else , so I went with the Yum hummus it wasn't that good overall the place just sucked"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place but there is something that makes me not want to award them 5 stars.  I've been a few times now and it's been more hits than misses.  Food quality it good.  I like the ahi tacos.  One skinny and one fat.   I actually thought the skinny was better.  It highlighted the freshness of the ingredients rather than masking with heavy sauces.  I love the decor and glad they kinda force you to sit and share tables.  I really respect that.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ist time eating here and definitely will not be my last. So many great, unique menu items to choose from. . .you will need to make more than one visit! The decor alone will have you talking about all the diversity wrapped up in Skinny Fats. Perfect name and concept for a one-of-a kind experience!"}
{"text":"Really a cool spot to hang out and a really innovative concept for the menu. The right side of the menu has all comfort/fattening foods while the left side has healthier options! So fun!  The food is also good. I've only tried some of the sandwiches and I have yet to be disappointed. The only downside is it's a little expensive for the portion size you get in comparison to other restaurants like it but I'll be back for the extensive menu and quality food"}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place? The service was great, and they are super helpful. I love that there are two versions of the same type of meal... the healthy versus the happy. I've had the Drunken Monkey Cakes and the Rediculous (Red Velvet waffles), Ahi Srirachi, and Ahi TacoSan.. all of which were DELISH!  Obviously I prefer to be happy versus healthy, but I learned that you could kindda make your own version of both and mix up the happy and healthy. Best of both world, if you will.  It was my second time going to this location, and I prefer it over the Warm Springs location because it is more quaint and not as commercial. It's a cool place to meet friends and chit chat. It is on the smaller side, so large groups would probably not fare well.   * Just a word of advice... Watch out for the sign. It's easy to miss if you're not paying attention. It's in a business park and unless you're looking, there aren't really any glaring signs like other restaurants. Also it is easy to get lost on the side streets if you're coming on the highway... there aren't any direct access roads to Dean Martin Dr. from the exits on the 15."}
{"text":"I was split between Holsteins Shakes and Buns or SkinnyFATS for a Sunday dinner. A friend who came from out of town decided we tried SkinnyFATS. We both never had dine in either places. So, it didn't matter which place, but pics for SkinnyFATS on Yelp   were enticing!   We came in and line was just starting to get busy at around 6pm. I ordered the Chix on Broadway with a side of truffle fries. Our order came in a timely manner. I was first impressed that the chicken to bread ratio was pretty darn good! The breaded chicken breast was huge than normal. It was also very moist.   However, taste was not there. To me, the breaded chicken was bland. The toppings that came with the Chix on Broadway were BLT, cheddar, red onion, and lemon herb aioli. All these toppings didn't help with the chicken being bland. Also, I prefer my bacon cooked crispy. I don't know if they cook their bacon not crispy all the time. Hey, but it's an easy fix! Ask to cook it crispy then?  I chose the truffle fries as my side that came with the meal. The fries were served barely warm and the fries were not the best I've had. Overall, I will try SkinnyFATS again for a second visit. I hope to come in when they are not that busy. The staff was friendly and helpful. Till then, hope to update for a better review and choose other creative selections on their menu :)"}
{"text":"We ran across this place based on yelp. It is a small restaurant but worth it if you have a car to get off the strip. I had a special that was a eggs benedict with chicken. If I would not have been eating with a vegetarian, it was big enough to share.  If I were to go back, I would go for waffles and some of their sweet choices,  we saw several go by and they looked great.  The service was okay, my special came much later than my companion's veggie sandwich.  I also ordered a juice and there were lots of seeds in and some full spinach leaves.  There was more meat on the menu than we expected but he still had a few choices.  Overall, it was a nice fresh meal, and I would recommend, it was not  favorite but worth stopping at again."}
{"text":"What a gem in Vegas!!! SkinnyFats is AMAZING!!! Their food diversity and quality is hard to top, and with that being said is complimented with a top-notch staff. What energy, what friendliness!!! Whether your being simple and having a burger or being bold and having chicken and waffles this place RULES!!! The only downside is that it's a tad pricey, but if you're willing to pay up for great quality and great service look no further!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. Menu selection was unique. Although the prices were a little more than I expected it was definetly worth every dime. I've been raving about this place since that day. I give the  5 because not only was the food great so was the service. If your in a hurry word of advise would be to call ahead."}
{"text":"Great lively interior design of the store. As soon as I walked in workers asked if I ever been here before and walked me through the whole menu. Food was delicious and definitely worth the price. Will be back again to try different dishes!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I pleasantly surprised with how fantastic the food was.  I just looked on Yelp for places near me to eat and this had high ratings.  Definitely agree with the high ratings.  Be prepared for a good wait in line but so worth it!!"}
{"text":"Today I faced my first disappointment with SkinnyFats, but everything was handled so amazingly that I had to write an update.   I had placed an order online to give myself time to pick up food on the way to work. It was just one item off the menu and the order said it would be ready in 25 minutes which is exactly when I arrived. They hadn't even began to make the order upon my arrival and I let them know not to even bother because I didn't have time to wait which is why I placed the order ahead of time.   Here's where everything turned around. While processing my refund, the cook quickly threw together their \"Smoke in a Bowl\" which isn't what I ordered, but they knew I wouldn't have a chance to eat until after work so they wanted to make sure I had something to eat. On top of the free meal, I received a phone call from I'm guessing the manager, or maybe just an employee, that I have a $20 gift card waiting for me the next time I visit.   You guys are awesome! Thank you."}
{"text":"The Wrap Supastar is the healthy breakfast burrito option, which was very good. The sauce definitely has some kick. The protein waffle with fruit was really good- I was worried it would taste like protein powder, but it didn't at all. Yay for yummy guilt free waffles! Also got the Strong Immunity shake, orange juice, lime, basil, soy milk, and frozen yogurt. Super delish, and I liked that the milkshake cups are reusable. A little off the beaten path but worth the stop."}
{"text":"So I'm visiting SkinnyFATS for the third time and I feel like I can write a review from an experienced view now.   Firstly, this place gets PACKED. I have yet to come here and experience a wait for a table. The waits have all been short, but a wait is a wait.   Secondly, I have ordered from their \"everything\" else side just one time because their healthy side is that delicious! I switched sides for the Chicken & Waffles which, if you're wondering, is worth it!  I ordered the Cranburkey burger from the healthy side the first time I stopped in, and during this visit. I wanted to try something else, but something about that perfectly cooked cranberry turkey patty called me back. I did opt for the truffle fries instead of the sweet potato fries though...so my meal wasn't 100% healthy. I washed my meal down with a glass - or more like, awesome reusable cup - of their fresh strawberry lemonade.   I will be back. Many times. SkinnyFATS is GOOD."}
{"text":"I really like what I had read about SkinnyFATS on Yelp. However, Everything I read I agree with Except the taste of the food. All of the food Ive seen and tasted \"looked\" really good and it looks fantastic in pictures, but something is \"off\".  This place is cramped and busy, but the employees do A great job here, and as far service goes its and good accurate and friendly as anywhere."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the soda, love the condiments, love the people that work here! Been here so many times even though I live all the way on the other side of town."}
{"text":"CauliFIRE. Naked Chix. Zucc it & Basic Chix are alllll favorites. The food is amazing, the atmosphere is amazing... Fonzia is amazing. They really care about your experience. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food, great service and a cool place!  Will eat here every time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and, I have not once been disappointed. The naked chicken was succulent and robust with flavor. The rice was even with mentioning because of how soft and evenly cooked it was. I also, had the Apple Ginger Shake and, that was amazing as well!! The only reason why I do not give this 5 stars was the Hummus plate my friend and I shared. It was very bland and course which was a tad disappointing. Overall, the experience was great and I will certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"This place feels like the first restaurant I've  be been to that was created to exist specifically in the post-yelp world.  We stopped here for breakfast while road tripping back to LA from boulder. We had our dog, so we had to take our food to go, but we ate at the little table under the tree right next to the restaurant. It was perfect because we didn't want to deal with going into a casino and didn't want some mediocre fast food. They had to put our food in to go containers because if health code, but who's going to fault them for following health code?  We had the #merica which is chicken fried steak on biscuits with eggs. Also I checked out everybody else's food while we were ordering and it looked terrific.  Also we had a choose your own juice, pricey  for sure but delicious, and it went with our meal perfectly. Also it was 100% juice as opposed to jamba juice where you get water and ice and whatever.  We will definitely be back next time we're driving through or going to Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! I got the cranburkey and my boyfriend got the classic. The yummus was delicious, the pita bread was so crispy!!"}
{"text":"This place is super good. The location was packed when I went but the food is worth it. They have a healthy and fatty version menu and both are really good. I recommend the buffalo cauliflower."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally find somewhere on this side of town I could run to for lunch. The menu is basically split in half - a skinny side and a fat side. I've tried several things from both and have not been disappointed yet! If you try to get in here M-F between noon and 2ish, be prepared to wait. It's a very small little place with extremely limited seating. Definitely worth trying out tho!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the first time this past Saturday. We arrived about 9:30am (shortly after they open) and it wasn't too busy. An employee described their menu and dining policies (self seating/counter service) and after we made our decision we were passed to another employee to take our order.   This woman was in the middle of writing out an order for a previous patron and no one bothered to help her take our order although some employees were just standing around. We ordered the S'Motherload, the Wrap Supastar, an iced coffee and a water. The coffee was great and the food was incredible but we never got the water we requested.  We will definitely be back to try other food on the menu!"}
{"text":"OMG was visiting Vegas and ran into this place. Delicious. Great service also. The only reason not five stars, cause it's not in socal."}
{"text":"The place is small and crowded. The line almost goes right to the door without many people being in line.   It is a nice unique touch to the \"usual\" fast food restaurants. One side of the menu features healthy food entrees while the other half features not as healthy entrees. The food overall is pretty good. Its a nice place to go for 2 with anyone who is on a diet or is a health conscious individual and a food junkie in one restaurant.   The girl taking the order at the register was really nice. She was the definition of delightful. I felt like ordering more just based off of her delightfulness.   It is a fairly costly place as a downside but quality is something you always have to pay a bit more for right? One thing I didn't like was that the signing receipt was asking for a tip after I swiped my credit card...if this was a service place where the servers come to the table and ask me for my order, fill drinks, etc...then I would understand a tip area.  Makes me wonder..does the owner not pay the employees enough that they ask the customer to pay for the food(customer covering cost plus profit) and the employee(covering owners cost) making the food as well??  Overall- Go try it! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles was great! Very cool vibe. Super friendly staff. Kitchen was very fast with our order.  Great play between healthy and happy food.  Very cool place."}
{"text":"Great food and great environment. However, our first experience wasn't so pleasant due to the cashier (Kelly) being extremely rude. When asked how's the food her answers were so short and didn't seem interested  in talking about the item. \"It's okay\" \"it's alright\" . Really upset me and my fiancé. Other than than the food was great, servers were great and the environment was good. Tortilla soup is a must."}
{"text":"My fav place to eat! Filet O Fire and the Cherry Popper burger are my favs! Also you can follow them on Facebook so you can see their secret menu items."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, amazing food and awesome atmosphere. Came here with my girlfriend for brunch and got the chicken and waffles. Great find!"}
{"text":"Thought it would be better than it was. Went for breakfaat and was looking for some really tasty healthy food. It was OK bit could have had more flavor."}
{"text":"Love SkinnyFATS! Great menu options whether I'm wanting something on the healthy side or something without caring what the calorie count is. I've seen them give military discounts, too!"}
{"text":"Always delicious and fresh! I get the Cherry-popper burger almost every time and it's awesome! Friendly and passionate staff shine here! Kid friendly menu, great soda flavors and relaxed atmosphere. It's a neat concept to have a skinny/healthy menu and a fat/normal menu. Everything I've had here is great! It's a little pricier than other places, but is totally worth it for the quality. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place my favorite is truffle fries and Pimp shrimp this location is really pretty it's my first time @ this location the ambiance is really nice I just wish their service is a little faster, but the people here are really nice!!!  Food is always great no matter what! They also have chairs/tables outside to sit down. Also have decent amount of choices for beer!! My favorite drink is skinnyfats punch yum!"}
{"text":"First time here and thought the location was a bit odd. It's really small. You order your food first which didn't work in our favor ( we couldn't find a table before our food came out). You literally have to watch someone get done eating and claim their seat.  I ordered from the \"skinny side\" and got a vegwich with a side of truffle fries and their strawberry lemonade. Lots of flavor, vegwich has a kick from their horseradish yogurt sauce. It went perfect with their strawberry lemonade which was very refreshing! The staff is also extremely nice and helped me with my order! Overall great place just a bit too small for how busy they get.   Also another plus for playing awesome music!"}
{"text":"Their food is great but they are rarely open when they say they are. Today, for the 3rd time, I've come at 9:30 on a weekend and they are closed. Their door and website say open at 9:00am. Super frustrating."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I had the Berry the Steak with gluten free flat bread and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This location and their employees are AMAZING! Top notch service every time I stop in and they make sure to get you exactly what you're looking for and would love even if you've never been here before. Out of the three locations they have in The Valley so far, I'm going to continue coming to this one! Not to mention the awesome playlist they always have on. #LOVE"}
{"text":"Don't you just love it when people acknowledge you at a restaurant and not just the cashier but even every staff walking by?   My favorite thing about restaurants is the vibe I get when stepping in. Although this place is small, it's got a big personality.   So on to the food.   Here's what we ordered: -Fat's Pickles -Caulifire -Smoke in a bowl -Wrap Supastar -The Classic -Hot Chix  The Fat's PIckles were great! They were crisp crunchy and came with this delicious sauce that actually compliments that sour taste. These pickles weren't soggy; it kept its flavorful crunch.  Caulifire: Yum! That buffalo sauce tastes great on that neutral cauliflower taste; comes a bit of a pico de gallo mix on top. The sauce isn't necessarily ranch either. It's definitely a delicious alternative.   Smoke in a bowl: The chicken was perfect. The flavors that stood out was the mix of the black beans, cilantro and pineapple! Talk about such a tropical burst on your palette! I loved it!   Wrap Supastar: My friend basically engulfed this thing so that's all that's needed to be said about that.   The Classic: So I was able to try my friend's burger; the burger is pretty good. I dont care much for burgers and sometimes can't distinguish the differences; I personally wouldn't order this again...maybe for the french fries though (Truffles yum).  Hot Chix: Loaded with a kick of buffalo sauce on chicken; this huge bowl of goodness is both aromatic and just a kick in yo face type of goodness. The blends of flavors of this dish is just perfect for those who like a 7 course meal that your taste-buds experience as you finish the meal.   Needless to say, SkinnyFats provides a pandemonic awakening of your tastes buds. So please, do yourself a flavor and try them out. The service, the comfort, the friendliess, enthusiasm and the kick ath delicious food options is a must try!"}
{"text":"Place is great the food options are perfect if you want to be skinny or a fat a$$ lol hence skinnyFATS, usually my go to when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are even bigger fans of this restaurant now that we have one near home. I've been amazed, they've even tempted him to healthier options.. stuff I never thought I'd see him eat!  Got the greek flatbread the other night, it was great. Only demerit was the balsamic vinegar on it. While I love balsamic, really really love balsamic, it was out of place and overpowered the other flavors. I'll order it again but ask for less balsamic and more tsatsiki sauce.  We've had quite a few different meals already, and we haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"I love skinnyFATS! The healthy food is delicious it makes healthy eating fun. The cookies are the best ever !"}
{"text":"I really liked this place before they got full of themselves. They don't have a location on my side of town so I don't dine in. Instead I prefer to order my food through Postmates. As if I'm not already paying $11 for delivery/service fee now Skinnyfats wants to impose a $2 Postmates fee on their customers. And yes the customer pays this \"Postmates fee\" Skinnyfats you should be ashamed of yourself! You don't pay for delivery drivers and instead of being grateful for a service like Postmates to deliver it for you without having the headache of paying your workers you instead charge US the customer $2 more dolllars! Greedy !!! And whoever started adding those disgustingly HUGE chunks of tomatoes in the spicy Latina soup should seriously be reviewed. I bet it's the same person who decided to impose a fee on Postmate customers!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about skinnyFATS for a while and finally got to check it out at downtown Summerlin. Man, I wished I hadn't waited so long. Fairly close to my office, I look forward to ordering lunch online from this awesome restaurant.  Our experience at the downtown Summerlin location could not have been better, from being greeted upon entry, to the great service we received at the register when we ordered, to the service when and after we got our food, which was delicious AND healthy (we ordered from the \"healthy\" side of the menu).  My wife got the \"TATS\" sandwich, and I got the \"Steakation,\" and we split the Tu-Nuts. All delicious and satisfying. My wife took half of her sandwich home. They also, surprisingly, had AMAZING beers!! I tried the bourbon-barrel-aged brown ale and the bourbon-barrel-aged dark Belgian. I'd never heard of the latter, but both were excellent. The Manager, Chase, clearly appreciates the benefit of carrying great product!  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had the Chickumm sandwich with Chicken Vegetable Soup. The wifey had the Buff Chix. We both enjoyed it very much. Fresh, healthy choices. Fun drink selection. Definitely worth going back."}
{"text":"My family has been twice in 3 weeks, so its easy to say we have enjoyed it for sure! My daughter and son love the Chicken tenders and fries. My husband has gotten a burger and a ahi sandwich both he said were awesome. \"Frickles\" fried pickles are a family favorite and the ones at SkinnyFats do not disappoint. Between both visits Ive tried all their tacos. All very yummy! The reason I feel they lose a star is the several menu items Ive tried were quite spicy. While I like spicy! seems that I think many people might have an issue with it or even be surprised by the spiciness based on descriptions."}
{"text":"Food is so GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll be back for sure!!!!!!! Healthy or Happy meal hihi either way it's a must try... The only download side is its space is small  and it can get really busy but worth it. Price is not bad 7.99-$12 really worth it!!"}
{"text":"Definitely like the food and atmosphere. It's small for how popular, only been able to actually eat here once and the staff was great even though I'm pretty sure it's always busy here. Food options are amazing, I've never had anything I didn't like so try it all!"}
{"text":"When we first started to go to skinny fats on durango we were super excited, and not exactly disappointed. Atmosphere is cool and cozy, but for how busy this place gets good luck finding a table. The food menu is glorious however super expensive. For two people u can easily spend $40+ which is over priced for the type of restaurant it is. Don't ever get an order to pick up and go as I only live 10mins away and it is always soggy by the time I get home. So all in all it was good the first few times and now I'm just over it. Not somewhere I can eat once a week, maybe once every 6 months. Service was always good though."}
{"text":"This place has unique and healthy choices. I heard from a friend that this place is a favorite. After looking over the reviews, I tried both an Ahi taco and the cherry bomber sandwich.  The Ahi taco had a great mix salad taste. The Ahi tuna tasted perfect with toppings but I hated the fried tortilla. It was hard and difficult to chew. I ended up only eating the inside. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed the burger. The meat was delicious and served to perfection. I enjoyed the spicy flavors , creamy sauce and juicy meat.  Overall, this place is a bit small and one may have difficulty finding a seat on a busy day. I would say it is not favorable for large groups. A major plus is that there is a water dispenser near the counter and this makes the wait a bit more tolerable. I intend on returning to this place."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by my MMA coach and I was not disappointed. Amazing food, great customer service, very clean, and awesome staff! Thanks for the great experience guys, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I always get the hangover remedy juice and the ti-nuts shareable dish with tuna, cucumber, coleslaw, almonds....it's awesome!!! Great food! $20 for all. Expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"The menu concept is fun and interesting. I've eaten here a handful of times and the food is good. My only complaint is that sometimes their effort to be creative results in dish that has an out-of-place ingredient that should've been omitted. That being said, this is still a great place. While the food is good and the menu is fun, the seating and acoustics do not make either location conducive to business meals."}
{"text":"Scrumptious, SkinnyFats!! So glad one opened on our side of town. Spicy Latina soup,  Ahi-two nuts for apps. Chix on Broadway and Filet O Fire sandwiches were flavor explosions!! Gotta grab a side of truffle fries as well!! I'm gonna be SuperFatso soon...."}
{"text":"Soooooo mf delicious. The breakfast Mac is so good! They had skinny foods that looked amazing but I wanted to go for comfort food"}
{"text":"*First and foremost, DON'T LET THE DOOR TRICK YOU! The entrance is a painted door that reads \"To the left, to the left.\" I kept driving down, thinking the restaurant was further left. It turns out the notice was to tell me to enter into the DOOR to the left instead of the right. I'm dumb LOL.*  Getting to my review, be prepared to hear nothing but the truth. In all honesty, the place was just...fabulous. It's self-seating, so you order up at the counter and they serve to your table. Note: it is not very big, so a party of 5+ will not do! Great place for a date, though ;)  Nothing on the menu is overpriced. I got the Berry Strong breakfast, which entailed an uber-fluffy round waffle (that took up the whole plate!) topped with a creamy, berry sauce and fresh berries, a homemade, marmalade-esque, citrus syrup to drench it with, and two strips of tasty turkey bacon.  This dish was wholesome, fresh, and delicious all over! Ugh, if only words could make it appear again.   Service was fine-tuned, the food came in no less than 10 minutes (I swear!) and the waiters were gentlemen. And cleanup crew was skillfully fast, because when we got up to leave, our table was wiped down so fast that a couple got seated there before we were out the door!  I can't think of a better place to have brunch in Vegas. Being from LA, SkinnyFATS felt close to home. But I truly recommend anyone go here who wants a heavenly breakfast in Sin City!"}
{"text":"This place is yummy, clean, and has a nice atmosphere and excellent food choices (both low fat and regular choices)."}
{"text":"I ordered the Naked Chicken and Hummus to go. Unfortunately, the rice with the Naked Chicken was under cooked...Eating hard bits in steamed rice is not good...yuck! The chicken was okay, not bad, however not great either.  Thank goodness the hummus and pita were good because I was hungry. I was hoping it would have been better after reading all of the great reviews. Oh well, I guess today just wasn't my day..."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Found on Yelp. Storefront looks like a mistake - is this really a restaurant? Came for breakfast. Two of us had \"healthy\" options - including steak and egg white omelette (Delish!). Two had \"happy\"'choices - chicken and waffles and 3 egg breakfast platter. Food was fresh, flavorful, creative and generous in portion. Help was very friendly, attentive and accommodating. DEFINITELY recommend. Way better than eating your crappy casino restaurant breakfast at twice the price."}
{"text":"My husband and I drove all the way from North Las Vegas to try this place. It was very good. I can understand all the reviews about the size of the place. It is quite small with approximately 8 tables or so. Despite the size, very trendy and inviting. I LOVE THE REUSABLE CUPS!!! Great idea and forward thinking marketing. Next time I use mine it's great advertising for them.  Since we drove 30 miles to eat here, I was very excited. I had previewed the menu online and read fellow Yelpers reviews before our journey. I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to order. My husband ordered the Chix on Broadway and the Caprazy salad. I ordered the slow boat to China and the Chix Flats.  Slow boat to China was Delicious! The sauces were delicious and the perfect sweet/salty/creamy compliment to the fresh cucumber flavor. The Chix Flats was tasty as well. The chicken was juicy and the salad on top was fresh and flavorful.  My husband was highly impressed with the Chix on Broadway. It was a huge sandwich. He had to cut it in half in order to be able to hold it. I had a piece of the bacon from his sandwich, Thumbs up! The truffle fries were just ok... the balsamic ketchup was the perfect compliment to them. The Caprazy salad was good. Nothing all that different or special about it.  The service wad excellent. Our food came out quickly and correctly. There was a very nice young man that cleared our plates and asked us about our meal. He was very friendly and we spoke about how far we had traveled. He was sincere in thanking us as we left and invited us to return.  Since our visit I have found out about the \"secret menu\" & I cannot wait to visit again!!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast, and love that the full menu was available even though it was about 9:30am since I'm not much of a breakfast person. That being said, I went out on a limb and ordered the Berry Strong. It was fantastic! Tons of fresh fruit and the orange agave syrup was nice and light. Add the great selection of hot tea they have, and it was a great way to start my day off right."}
{"text":"Not bad service for it being so busy, but I did have probably the blandest sand which I've ever had unfortunately."}
{"text":"Ordered the more cow bowl, wasn't pleased. It was extremely sweet and too much sauce. My rice came out soggy.   A friend also ordered Smoke In A Bowl and it tasted very bland.   Another friend ordered the Chicken and Waffles, that was really good!   The coffee is 2$ with unlimited refills, worth it.  Service was A+!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding food no matter what you order.  Best of both worlds for those that want to indulge and those that are calorie counters with the same quality and taste for both. If you don't like this place, you have problems!"}
{"text":"Yummy fresh food. The restaurant is quite small and cozy so not good for large groups. I had one of their specials and it was really good. The service was really good, very attentive. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"What a great find!   I had the Saracha ahi tacos and califire.  The tacos were loaded with seared ahi and the califire may make me give up buffalo chicken forever.  With so many reviews I don't feel the need to say much other than, go here.   The whole place is a great business model.   Tasty food, at a reasonable price and friendly workers."}
{"text":"Ok, tried this place again at 6:30 at night. There was a line and one girl working a register. There were at least 4 employees in back eating dinner/chatting. The 30 min we were there, they never had anymore help in front. I've worked in restaurants for years and I don't understand why you would only have 4 employees on duty during dinner time on a Friday."}
{"text":"I recommend the \"Sweet Cheese Us\" or the \"Hot Chix\" and the truffle fries. They have a HAPPY side of the menu and a HEALTHY SIDE of the menu. When you're looking at the menu it honestly feels like trying to determine whether or not you want to join the dark side (HAPPY), and it wins every time! I've always had a great experience here. I love the ambiance and they have a good little selection of beer!"}
{"text":"The interior décor is cute and casual. You place your order first, pay and then the food is brought to your (open seating) table.  My favorite bite was the cherry-bomb burger. It was juicy and very tasty. I also ordered sweet potato fries...which initially didn't accompany my burger. I tried to wait for the fries, but the idea of my delicious-looking burger getting cold right in front of me wasn't an option. So I ate my burger...and then my fries finally came out. There were other patrons there but it wasn't a rush by any means. Next time I hope that the food delivery timing is a bit more spot-on. All of it tasted wonderful though.  Another time soon!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. However, I always order a hangover remedy juice woth my order. I'm paying $10 for a juice it better be fresh! Now they supposedly make them in the morning and you get it in a bottle premade. But today is 2/29 wednesday amd the juice was made 2/24 saturday! And it expires a week later?!? Next time I'm just going to go straight to the girl and have her make it fresh but beware when you order. If you're paying $10 for a juice it better be fresh otherwise if it sits it lose its nutritional value. If I wanted bottled juice I would just go to Vons and get one."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! It is small and cozy. Great service! The girl in the front made sure to welcome everyone and explain how things work there. Delicious food! We went for breakfast and were very satisfied! We were pleased to find out they serve all their food including breakfast all day! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I recently checked this place out and I was not impressed at all. I got the buttermilk waffle and it was not good at all. It was hard and cold. My friend got the chicken and waffles and I will say the chicken was good but that waffle was WACK. I sent it back and second one was worse. Service was good and everyone was friendly but I won't be going back. And 8bucks for a medium orange juice ! That's more than my meal! No thanks !   Ok so the manager Lana messaged me personally after my review and offered me a second round at Skinny Fats! That was extremely nice of her so I will give it another go and report back! Thanks Lana !"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time we had a great experience when we walked into the door from the counter top the cashier was very polite and understanding on what my specific request was as I have a food allergy with peppers. We ordered drinks which took a bit too long to get to us customer service was polite but when they brought out our food they were a little less then what we were hoping. My bowl was twice the portion as my guests along with his plate it looked like they just threw it in the bowl and that was it. As my food goes I was impressed with the dish until I saw i had peppers in my dish which I specifically asked not to have because of my allergy so it kinda was hard to maneuver around that overall I really liked the menu and the vibe but the food clearly wasn't made with love and thats what we look into when we go out love in our food people local is love well be back though!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the service and the tuna taco alone!  The food was good, even the \"fats\" side of the menu seemed a bit healthy.  I had some crack worthy cookie that was amazing. Butterscotch something or other... Just try the cookies."}
{"text":"Super yummy and so many options both healthy and tasty!!!! The cranburky was fantastic and what I saw of smoke in the bowl that my date inhaled smelled fabulous. She said it was really good.  Only problem is the wait and I am currently on a mission against frozen French fries. However they were drizzled with truffle oil.  Highly recommend and will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is a restaurant that balanced out healthy food and happy food. Their healthy menu contains a variety of salads, sandwiches, flatbreads, and sides with healthier ingredients, while their happy menu contains the same repertoire with ingredients not as beach body oriented, let's say.  I went to SkinnyFats and was offered a \"secret menu\" item, as several appeared on a little monitor set on top of their cash wrap. What I ordered was some sort of turkey club-sequel sandwich, but way better. It had whole grain bread, fresh tomatoes and baby arugula, creamy goat cheese, crispy bacon, and the juiciest chicken with a side of fries, yes -- the not as beach body oriented ones.  The orchestra of flavors from the sandwich was great. The tingly creamy sourness of the goat cheese acting as an enzyme for the gamut of flavor notes that the sandwich had. The fresh tomatoes and arugula gave the sandwich a crunch and freshness that held you by the hand and walked you over to the juiciness of the grilled chicken -- and just when you thought you had hit the cusp of the flavourful ride -- there was that crunch from the bacon that just cannot be underestimated in a sandwich. The saltiness but firm flavor made it a grand experience, it just culminated in a subtle mix of sour freshness that was neutralized by the bacon and then layer with the tasty, toasted but slightly soggy from the veggies, whole grain bread. My girlfriend ordered a tuna salad, with greens, berries, nuts, and dressing,  which I was unable to get to but I assume they were as fresh as my vegetables, and seared tuna. The tuna had a crunchy bordering which was citrusy and a bit crunchy. The texture was, as most raw tuna, slimy but the flavor had a slight hint of the spices used to sear it and its own fishy flavor. It was a delicious flavor profile but I bet it must have been better with the other greens and components of the salad.  Needless to say, I am definitely going back to SkinnyFats in the near future."}
{"text":"Ok we went again! Today I updated my 4 star to 5!! And today we had the filet of fire and the mean bean sandwich and oh my!! This time the food came out much quicker and all at once as it should. Good job! Once again all the staff was so nice and super helpful!! I did the salad as a side to be more healthy.  And not that the salad was bad (because it was great) but skip the salad and eat the truffle fries!! Love this place! Everything was so good!       Cute, clean and delicious! Loved this little spot! Weird location on Dean Martin but great food and will defiantly try their delivery. When you walk in the staff is super helpful to tell you about their menu and the \"secret menu\".  Their food was fresh, well seasoned and tasty! Only negative was we had two dishes one was hot and one was cold. The hot burger and fries showed up first and we had to wait for the cold meal to arrive so the hubby's burger got cold while we waited for my cold ahi dish.  I.e. Why I gave them 4 stars. But will certainly be back as there were about 20 other items on the menu that sounded amazing!!"}
{"text":"O. M. G!!! Who knew that healthy eating could taste so amazing and wonderful?! It is a bit of a small space, so seating was a little tricky, however I cannot wait to go back"}
{"text":"Love their green juice. Worth the trip. If it looks like you are in a warehouse/office area, you are heading in the right direction :)"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly and the food was awesome. This location is very small and seating is limited. Food was made and to out table very quickly."}
{"text":"The sandwiches we had, the Sweet Cheesus and the Chix on Broadway were pretty good, the fries needed some work though, they needed to be cooked better so they are not soft and the portions were small. Be prepared for a wait and packed place at lunchtime, this place seems to be pretty popular. I would go back here before or after the lunch crowd. The staff seems to be nice folks for it being so crowded in there."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining here and it's so cute! The staff was friendly and greeted me promptly when I walked in. The menu is so fun; on one side there are healthy options (under 600 calories per meal) and on the other side the no so healthy options. They also have a juicery attached to the restaurant.   I opted for the buff chix which was Buffalo chicken fingers with truffle fries and cucumber infused water they offered in the refreshment stand. The chicken was moist and the fries were so yummy! The portions were decent, more than enough food for me.   The atmosphere is very hipster but relaxed. They chose a good location next to a fit boot camp and massage envy. I'll be back to visit; there are many options on the menu I want to try."}
{"text":"I was so excited when this location opened. It's a great place for a quick lunch or dinner. It's great to have the option of healthy or happy. The truffle fries are delicious in flavor but were a little soggy. The chicken sandwich lacked seasoning but nothing a little salt couldn't fix. The service was quick and servers were sure to greet and say goodbye, but I had to ask for a side of mayo twice. I do expect a few kinks in a new restaurant and have faith that eventually this location will be as good as the others. I will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, food, and atmosphere. It has a healthy side and a happy side. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.   Best place in this area by far."}
{"text":"I've been to Skinny Fats several times over both locations & have loved it every time. Normally I get the Ahi Taco San & Slow Boat to China but after seeing the RaspBomb.com on their FB page I decided to order that up with the truffle fries ($12.97). I was highly disappointed. There was no raspberry taste what-so-ever to the sandwich even though the bread appeared to have raspberry swirled throughout it. It tasted just like a grilled chicken sandwich with alfalfa sprouts. I asked for alfalfa sprouts after the sandwich came since I forgot to ask when I ordered. Truffle fries were disappointing as well. No flavor although they said there was truffle oil on the fries. There was no salt as I added that myself. I wished I would have gotten the sweet potato fries one of my lunch mates had. I hate ketchup (gasp! I know the absurdity of that) so I asked for ranch from one of the servers & even after I said I don't use ketchup she told me there was a 50 cent charge for ranch. Seriously? I am not using both - but using ranch in place of ketchup. I would have thought they would have told me they were charging for alfalfa sprouts instead of ranch since alfalfa sprouts would be a higher cost to them. I told them to forget it. I tried the fries with the Jalapeno ketchup that was on the table. ICK. Sad to say today wasn't that great of an experience at Skinny Fats."}
{"text":"Food is heavy on the salt and better on picture than in real life. Other than that, staff was super cool and very minimal wait time Tuesday afternoon."}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie burger with bacon- yes, I know, but I'm not a vegetarian and this brings out the taste of the burger! Lol The sweet potato fries are wonderful!  I only gave 4 stars because although I ordered off the \"skinny\" side, the portion size was so large that it didn't matter what I ordered!"}
{"text":"When visiting Las Vegas I was taken to SkinnyFATS by my friend who lives locally. I can definitely say that I was impressed and very satisfied!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND  The entire menu is delicious! I ordered the 'Mean Bean' which normally consists of a housemade black bean party, spinach, red onion, tomato, avocado, spicy hummus, and a wheat bun (if is on the \"Between the Buns - Healthy\" section). They were very accommodating to my requests and exchanged it to be wrapped in lettuce with grilled onions and normal hummus. I loved loved loved it and have been craving it ever since. The black bean patty was yummy and I left feeling full, but like I had eaten something good for me. I also tried the 'Hangover Remedy' (a juice consisting of Apple, cucumber, celery, carrot, beer, spinach, and ginger - only 191 calories!). It was very tasty and refreshing, definitely recommend it. My friends ordered the 'Healthy Chicks' breakfast (3 egg whites, turkey bacon, fruit, and 9 grain toast). They loved their meals as well!  The only downside to this location is that there is very limited seating and you may have to wait. Other than that, it is great! I highly recommend it and definitely would go out of my way to eat there again when in Vegas"}
{"text":"Been to this place multiple times and am annoyed every time how packed it is. I've loved and hated different items on the menu. Thought the brussle sprouts were okay, the blue steak was also okay. I feel like this is a place you have to go to a dozen times to weed out the really good menu items. And haven't had a juice yet that I liked but  I would recommend it to a friend for food to go or delivery. I enjoyed the broadway chicken sandwich and the fries."}
{"text":"It's about time to write a review for SkinnyFATS... as with the rave on Yelp it's easily one of the \"coolest\" places to be. The vibe here is unbeatable.  Food-wise it can be actually hit and miss - some were amazing, some were mediocre.  Lately, I order deliveries from them via Postmates as this location is close to my place."}
{"text":"Freaking Unbelievably Awesome!!  My mind is blown. Stopped here for lunch and beyond thrilled that we tried this little hole in the wall eatery.  The atmosphere is lively and fun. The service was quick and knowledgeable.  The restaurant was clean with great seating.   By far the best flavors I've had in a long time. Both my appetizer and entree were layered in flavor. My taste buds were delightfully tantalized.   First we had a signature entree called the Slow Boat to China. It was a Asian chicken salad ontop of a cute cucumber boat topped with amazing slaw, chopped almonds and a spicy sauce.   For my entree I had the Cherry Popper burger. It was incredible. I've never tasted anything like this burger before. AHHHHHMAZZZING!! It was a half pound juicy beef patty, topped with a perfectly cooked fried egg, pepper jack cheese, spicy slaw and a delicious pepper marinade served on a Hawaiian roll.   Definitely a place to stop for."}
{"text":"I loved the layout of the place, how it had an inside and outside dining area that you could choose from! The healthy menu got me filled out, however I think I would prefer picking from the happy menu next time. Other than that, I love love this place and will definitely come back again to try it!"}
{"text":"3.5/5 Pretty good for a burger spot  Reminds me of an a&w though  Which for the price point is a bit weird Truffle fries are good they didn't get my meat temp right... I don't like to eat temps above medium and prefer Med rare for burgers... Kind of empty. Selection is good, service is friendly"}
{"text":"First time at this location & was looking forward to the usually delicious Vegwich! However, I think they changed the bread from sliced bread to a disappointing multigrain bun (would've preferred the bread that my mom's Teriahi came on), & what really makes the sandwich is the horseradish yogurt, & the horseradish was completely undetectable. Still appreciated the nice location & the complimentary cucumber lemon water & great service, but the food was a disappointing to show my mom for her first time. I wonder if Vegwich is still good at other original location."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and helpful!   Food was mehhhhh. The smoke in a bowl & naked chix protein bowls, both tasted like they were frozen meals... Not worth the price AT ALL.  The chocolate chunk cookie however, was AMAZING!! One of the best in the market!!"}
{"text":"Talk about oxymoron!   The food is sinful! I took on the meltdown which was a 1/2 lb patty melt served with truffle fries. The meat was cooked perfectly and was placed between thickly sliced bread that was grilled in butter and cilantro. From the fountain tap I served myself continuous rounds of ginger ale. The specialty juice drinks are the skinny part of the phrase. I passed for a lack of a better word. Minus well keep it consistent with the bababad!"}
{"text":"Delicious, wholesome food! My wife and I split the Veg-TO-Bowl and Buff Chix with truffle fries. Every bite was tender, moist, and flavorful.   The atmosphere is bumping. The place was jam packed, so bring your patience. Both the staff and the diners carried a good energy; upbeat and happy. It's worth the wait in line. You'll need the time anyhow to decide what tasty meal you'll order. Oh, and they do breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"This place was so good that I had to go back the very next day.  First time I tried the cauliflower tacos which were amazing.  Next day was the vegwich,  a portobello cap burger... My mouth is watering just typing this review.  Recommend it to all my fellow skinnyfat people and everyone else :)"}
{"text":"Super great place! I enjoyed my steakation burger! The sodas are awesome too! Definitely awesome place. Coming back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I found myself having to take an unplanned trip to Las Vegas, and since I have never been and was famished, I called my best friend who frequents Vegas often for recommendations and he instantly said: \"SkinnyFats!\" I didn't even get to finish my sentence. After filling our gas tank, we drove over to SkinnyFats to fill our stomachs. We started with the sweet potato fries; crispy, salty and hot. Everything I want in a fry. And the ketchup selection is deliciously unique! I greatly enjoyed the peppercorn ketchup.  I ordered the Green Gem salad with grilled albacore. Delicious! I love ahi, and it was perfect on this salad. The caper vinaigrette was sweet and tangy, and the balsamic drizzle added a delectable depth.  My fiancé ordered the More Cow Bowl, and he ate that up right quick. Not sure how he felt about it as he gets grumpy when he's tired (long drive with Christmas traffic).  We shared a cream soda with our meal and oh my my... super creamy, smooth and bubbly.  If this place wasn't over 250 miles away from me, I would go to this place as often as possible."}
{"text":"Such a colorful & fun place!  Their concept of a \"healthy\" and a \"happy\" side is awesome! Attracts the health freaks and the people on their \"cheat days\" LOL!  I've tried a few things on the menu and I have not been disappointed!   Everything is fresh and plentiful!  Last visit, I had a Cranburkey with side of Sweet Potato Fries!   Their sweet potato fries are sooo good! And the turkey burger with their cranberry sauce is moist and delicious!   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food good but the staff has great energy and makes you feel very welcome!!! Fonzia in particular is VERY sweet. The first thing I heard when I walked in was \"How are you doing today!?\" and saw her beautiful smile. She has great customer service skills and I'll definitely visit this location more!"}
{"text":"Neat and healthy food as well as some scrumptious Naughty choices. Very organic environment. Cool crowd go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place always hits the spot. I've never left unsatisfied. This is the perfect place to go when you and your friends just can't figure out what to eat. The customer service is on point from the cashiers to the servers. I will say I prefer this location over the one on Dean Martin, only because this one has a lot more room. My dish of choice is buff chix but I like to sub their buffalo sauce for their barbecue sauce instead and it's uh-mazing. And if you're feeling extra indulgent- get a cookie. They're huge and served warm."}
{"text":"This place has a very unique take on their menu. They have the calorie conservative side and also the \"happy\" side. If you are eating low carbs, this place offers ample options! For the side dish option, they even have the cauliflower rice, which was very good. I ordered the seared tuna burger, which was really tasty but I would probably order it with less sauce next time. I wish they would expand this to the east coast so I can have it regularly!"}
{"text":"My wife and I talked her Grandpa (who is a LV local) into checking out this highly touted place. We got a little nervous on the drive to SkinnyFATS from the airport, as it definitely in a rundown, sketchy looking part of town. However, once inside the restaurant, we became true believers. I enjoyed a Green Mile smoothie, and Shrimp Tacodilla and Ahi Srirachi tacos. So delicious! Would definitely start our next trip to Vegas right back at this place."}
{"text":"I didn't get a chance to try this place because the place was too small. Seating was limited.  I looked around and the food looked amazing but the seating ruined it for me.  Maybe next time I will give it another try. Location sucked too. Off the strip. Not walking dost"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good burger joint. They unusual toppings. I guess because they have healthy options. But they have cool tv's and a outside sitting area. Their pretty fast with the food. The price is reasonable as well i think. So i would recomend you coming here for a lunch date. Or even just a whatever lunch"}
{"text":"I got hot wings and fries and it was delicious! The soda is very different no doubt but still drinkable. I don't recommend the soda if you're very picky though. The staff were very kind. It can get busy but its worth the wait in my opinion. The place is so cute aswell. The drawings on tbe wall are adorable. I'd definitely go back there when I visit las vegas again :)"}
{"text":"I go to Skinny Fats weekly, I love their pressed juices and Skinnyfats Punch! I eat their truffle fries weekly, and they have a lot of great options. I love the #3dollarjuiceclub, which I am a member of, and love that you can customize your drinks. They staff are always very kind, and inviting. Can't wait to go back today for some more of those delicious truffle fries!"}
{"text":"I flippen love this place. Healthy AND good?? Are you kidding me? And the employees rock...especially Stephanie. She might just have the best personality EVER! And I've just got to say, I love any place with a \"Happiness Meter\" Check it out!! You'll have found your new favorite restaurant too!!"}
{"text":"I'm more of a FATS guy myself, but I love this concept. One side of menu is 'healthy' while the other is 'happy' (aka a lot less healthy aka all my favorites). Seems a touch gimmicky at first, but it's well done. All the food is high quality, and the service is excellent.  The lady and I shared a Steak Eyes 2.0 (happy) and Protein Waffles (healthy) and it was perfect. We got to indulge without feeling like total garbage afterwards. But dude those Steak Eyes were amazing. Country Fried Steak on Jalapeño Cornbread with Two Eggs & Gravy on top. OOOHH BOYYY!!!  My buddy got the S'motherload, which is basically a Breakfast Burrito the size of a boot and covered in a delicious Cajun Queso sauce.   Five fat stars."}
{"text":"Aside from having the coolest concept ever, skinnyfats also rocks some pretty awesome food. In the few times I've tried it, I have yet to be disappointed! The caulifire was delicious, the zucc it was hearty, and my avocado breakfast toast was to die for. Will definitely be back again:)"}
{"text":"I love the concept of SkinnyFATS ... there are so many things I want to try on this menu! I'm already planning my next meal. I ordered the RaspBomb Sandwich and a Tropical Tea. I loved the sandwich, but next time, I may ask for the creole sauce on the side. When driving to the location, I thought that maybe we weren't going to the right place because it doesn't look like a restaurant would be in this location, but the atmosphere is actually cool once you step inside. I can't wait to go back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious. Lunch and breakfast are both bomb! This place gets super packed at lunch time, and is sometimes hard to find a seat to eat. The patio area is cute. The drinks are really good, love the cream soda. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable and they recommend great dishes if you are unsure of what to order. Try this place, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Awesome flavor.  Fast service. Great quality for the price.  Lots of selections to chose from. Helpful and funny staff. Our cashier was very knowledgeable and even suggested augmented options for special need diets. Loved it."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more. The location is in an industrial area. It is tiny. You may have to wait for a table because it's small. The sandwich was not bad but it did not contain much sauce (hummus), so it was dry. When I asked for a side of honey mustard-- one of the girls hesitated & then said \"I guess I can give you some\". The truffle fries were good. It's worth a try if you want healthier food in Las Vegas. But, don't expect too much."}
{"text":"The menu was thorough, with healthy choices that listed calories, to the unhealthy stuff that just sounded (and tasted!) yummy! The service was good, and the food matched. It's a cool spot to go to that doesn't have the crazy crowds of Vegas.  Chicken sandwich: bomb but needed some Sat   Steak with biscuits and gravy: delicious!  Breakfast burrito with filet mignon: good!!"}
{"text":"I give this place two thumbs up!  Not only tasty burgers but a fun atmosphere. The servers were friendly and made you feel welcome. There menu is not a typical burger joint but that is what I had. Can't go wrong ."}
{"text":"Very great staff which was absolutely helpful to me. The food was delicious and the cane sodas were awesome. I highly recommend this place and will return to the restaurant as often as I can."}
{"text":"Such a great friendly vibe and AMAZING food. Everyone there made gave us such a wonderful experience, and Zia went out of her way to connect with us."}
{"text":"This place is pretty popular. I've seen many posts about it via Facebook and Instagram, so I thought I would give it a try. We went on a Friday just before closing and it was nearly empty. I already had second thoughts about going because it was difficult to find. Upon entering, I was surprised at how small this place is. Considering its popularity, I was expecting it to be bigger.   Their menu has a \"healthy\" side and a \"happy\" side. My hubby and I opted for something on the happy side. I had a Cheezy Peezy, a pizza heavily packed with cheese. I was excited because I'm a total cheese lover, but the goat cheese was packed on, so the taste was very strong. I could only eat one piece. Hubby ordered a Meltdown. I took a couple of bites from it and it was pretty good. We both had a side of truffle fries. We thought they were good, but not too much different than regular french fries. We also ordered a strawberry lemonade, which was amazing! The lemonade is made in-house and it tastes so fresh.   Although the food did not wow us, the service was really good. I wish I knew the name of the girl who talked to us, but she was super helpful. She gave us a lot of suggestions and had a good attitude which I always respect.   Honestly, I feel like this place is a little overrated, but I will return sometime so I can try some of the healthier dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent classic burger and sweet potato fries. Make sure you try the jalatcha catshup. Didn't care for the house salad. Great service"}
{"text":"First the story.  I am in Las Vegas for business and that included Super Bowl Sunday.  I really didn't want to eat out so I searched for a nearby take-out that I could run to at halftime.  I found SkinnyFATS on Yelp, read the reviews and proceeded to place my online order.  The order was confirmed.  Right at halftime I went to pickup my order and they had closed early to allow their employees to go home and watch the game.  Bummer for me.  Now, as Paul Harvey would say, for the rest of the story.  SkinnyFATS not only refunded my money but gave me a credit for more than my original order had been.  Thank you, great customer service!  Now for my meal (the next day).  I again ordered online.  The food was ready at the designated pickup time and it was delicious! The order size was actually more than I could eat."}
{"text":"Great food, unique and interesting menu. The staff was friendly and helpful. Katie was especially great. She is a wonderful ambassador to your company"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, a bit over priced . Got the cluck moo and side of country potatoes."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today. My husband ordered buffalo chicken strips from the \"happy\" menu & I had a flatbread pizza from the \"healthy\" menu. He ate every bite of his food, as did I. The food was amazing! I ordered juice with cucumber, carrot, and lemon which I was not a fan of. I ended up giving the whole thing to my daughter since she loved it. My husband drank a mocha & he said it had a weird taste to it. So for the food I give 5 stars, but the drinks could use some work."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended to me, and I live close by. I've tried it a few times, and I think it's incredibly over-rated. It's good, but it leaves something to be desired for me. It's a little expensive for what it is. I treated my parents to it once and they didn't like it at all. I do like that you have healthy + unhealthy options; it's a great concept, but I'm not convinced on the execution."}
{"text":"Love that this place offers so many healthy options. Take your pick: the skinny or the fat side of the menu.    What we ordered:  - Wake 'n Bacon: ordered with egg whites instead and a side of fruit. The fruit wasn't as fresh as I would have liked, but the sandwich was really good. - Vegwich: Made with portobello mushroom with a side of sweet potato fries. I could eat this every day. The mushroom was so perfectly grilled, very juicy. The sweet potato fries had the perfect crunch in them. - Coffee: Freshly brewed and comes with almond milk if you ask.  Place your orders at the counter,  they will bring your food out to your table. They also make sure to check up on you if you need anything. Place is pretty small with tables jammed packed. Be prepared to be cozy with your neighbors. Overall, this is a great place for breakfast/brunch/lunch.  Be sure to try their own special (smoked or regular) jalapeno ketchup! Next time I'm definitely bringing a bottle back with me. Can't wait to come back again next time in town."}
{"text":"Great tasting unique dishes. The lines can be pretty long at times, but it's worth it. The Greek flatbread is full of flavor and quite tasty. As someone who generally eats healthy, I like this place because it has unhealthy options too and I can eat here without forcing my friends to eat the same way I do."}
{"text":"I went here for a friends going away the place was pretty trendy! The food selections were original and the staff was very welcoming. The only downside was they forgot two of our orders but once we got them it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time, was so happy with the menu and the service will go back and recommend it to everyone.  It has such a fun menu, a healthy side and a happy side, each menu item corresponds with a matching item with the opposite side.  You can pick a healthy entree and a happy side, that is what I did.  My friend had the chicken and waffles and said they were delicious.  The place was decorated so nicely, they have a really cute patio area outside too.  The place was busy, but they had plenty of help for everyone and they were so friendly, this was the Warm Springs location.  It would be so easy to go there if you were on a strict diet or a veggie.  Try it out and enjoy"}
{"text":"Food was same standard and staff is friendly. There is not enough seating. Best to order takeout, do not try to dine inside."}
{"text":"I wanted to like the food I ordered because of all the great reviews. I ordered the veg sandwich. Portobello mushroom and other veggies.  Kale?! Did not work. Bread was soggy, mushrooms were cold, generally underseasoned."}
{"text":"Very creative menu. Has a healthy side and a not so healthy side for people like me lol. Visited skinnyFATS while my girlfriend and I where in Vegas. I had the chicken and waffles which where delicious. Girlfriend had the smoke in a bowl which she really didn't like, said it tasted like pace salsa with plain white rice. On the other hand their juices are pretty good. Ordered the liquid defense which was surprisingly good. I would recommend this place if you're into healthy food or junk food. Next time imma have to try the cherry popper. Sorry I didn't get any pics I was too hungry!"}
{"text":"This location is beautiful. I'm in love with the art on the walls, the lighting, and the natural wood features. The way food is ordered and served is pretty cool too, although it is kinda awkward to stand around for a table if there aren't any ready to sit at.   The service here is excellent! From the cashier to the food runners to the bussers, everyone was super friendly and accommodating.   I got the vegan blue berry yum yum French toast and the avocado scramble.  -French toast was not very good but it was edible. I think they're doing too much with it and could easily simplify the whole dish to make it better.  -The avocado scramble I was actually really looking forward to because I dig a good tofu scramble and I make them for myself all the time. However, it was gross. Over powered by turmeric and garlic, I couldn't eat it. Tone down the spices please!   The staff was VERY understanding that I didn't like my food and offered to remake the dish or make me something new. I just got a juice (hangover) instead and that was really yummy.   My boyfriend got the steakation and LOOOOVED it! The hummus that came out with his burger on the other hand was not so loveable... him and I both tried it and weren't into it and we've tried a lot of hummus.  Not giving up on you though, Skinny Fats! I'll try something new next time."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this restaurant. You can basically customize a meal however you'd like and I appreciate that kind of customer freedom. The options were a bit overwhelming and as a vegan I expected more meat free selection (for reasons unknown). I was sad to see that some of the only vegan things were fried. The girl at the counter was very very nice though and had no qualms explaining the menu.  To start I got the rosemary hummus and vegetable chimichurri which was undoubtedly the best thing on the menu. My hangover remedy juice was yummy, no complaints there but the mean bean vegan burger I got was gross. Mouth feel was all off, and the whole thing just lacked flavor and texture in all aspects.   Atmosphere and staff were great but the food I may have to give a second shot.   Update: no more hummus and vegetable chimichurri :( that's sad"}
{"text":"This place is always amazing, the staff are awesome, and food is excellent no matter what you get,  keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I honestly feel like this place is overhyped. I don't know why people like to hype up overpriced food. However, the food is pretty good if you're looking to spend $40 on two people. I like the Cherry Popper burger. I think that's what it's called. The Buff n Chix is alright too. I think my favorite is the buffalo cauliflower. I hate cauliflower so that says a lot."}
{"text":"I went here with two of my girlfriends for drinks and food and we weren't very impressed. My best friend and I got there before our other friend, and we wanted to wait for her arrival before we ordered food. We went up to the cashier to just order some beers first, but due to their liquor license, you can't order any alcohol without ordering food too. We thought this was strange and inconvenient. The cashier was extremely friendly and knowledgeable on the beer. The beer was really good and tasted just as she described it. I ordered two filet mignon tacos for $7.95 and they were by far the worst tacos I have ever had in my life. The filet mignon tasted bland and was COLD. There really wasn't much in the taco besides shredded onions that looked like some sort of white cheese but there was no cheese at all in the tacos, or sauce, or sour cream, or guacamole, so they were just cold, bland, and dry. I probably wouldn't return. There is much better places to eat and drink at inside this mall."}
{"text":"I enjoyed skinny fats very much, I can't wait to eat there in the future. Nice creative twist to the food."}
{"text":"This place is super cute! It has GREAT food that will not break your resolutions. Can't wait to come again!"}
{"text":"This place is so great and delicious!! They have food for everyone's liking! The vegan options are delicious! It was my first time eating here today and the staff was super friendly! One of the girls (didn't get her name) was awesome! She helped me out and was super attentive. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love SkinnyFATS!! The boyfriend and I always go to the dean Martin location but since that one is small, it gets really busy! We've came to this location a few times and although we love skinnyfats, the customer service here is always rude. We don't understand why, we both work in the food industry and are always friendly but always get greeted with annoyed faces, and bad service over all. *sigh*"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is always so good and I love their fresh juices. My favorite meal is the stuffed pepper but have yet to be disappointed with any meal here. I would recommend anyone try it out if you haven't done so yet."}
{"text":"Great non typical fast food.  Had the Nice to Greek You order and it was very good although not exactly filling.  The side salad I thought was too small.  The choice of ice teas was also good.  Communal big table was OK, not thrilled with it.   Staff was friendly.  Overall  a great experience will be back for at least a second time."}
{"text":"Well... Was digging this place until tonight... Placed an order to go was waiting 45 mins for 2 burgers and some chicken fingers... Watched 6 other to go orders (who placed orders after me) get called out and walk out before me... Turns out they didn't even call my name... (To busy yapping amongst each other) ended up putting my order under a \"heat lamp\" in the back until the girl who rang me up realized that i was still waiting... Told another employee that i was waiting... When I received my order the employee said to me \" Im sorry i put it under the heat but im sorry Have a nice daaaaay...\"  I asked if she even called out my name and she replied \"Im sorry... Have a nice day...\" Leaving me with soggy slop to bring my pregnant wife... Horrible experience I will no longer be visiting this establishment do to the complete lack of customer service and care. Good riddance...."}
{"text":"Looove this place. One of my favorite spots in Las Vegas. I really enjoy the GF greek pizza.  It's so tasteful and healthy! - I also like the 3 chix bkfast.  the names of their dishes are very creative and funny.  They have a skinny side and fat side of the menu and items on both sides are delicious.  The restaurant is very clean, modern, and nice.  They serve the food very nicely and prices are good.  I have never seen a restaurant doing such a great job with the pictures of their food and social media......these guys know what's up.....they have created a hip restaurant at affordable prices......"}
{"text":"I love this place soooo much. I drive out of the way about once a week to eat here and can't wait for the location at downtown summerlin to be opened! My favourite dishes are the spicy Latina soup (I get it with no toppings because I find them a little sweet) and the fried chicken salad."}
{"text":"If I could eat here every day of my life I would. Chef Josh Green is an absolute genius. Every dish he creates is well thought out, perfectly arranged and down right delicious.  I can't wait till my next trip to Las Vegas to eat at SkinnyFats! Breakfast all day and the Eggs Benedict is always outrageously good.  I lust over all their menu items on instagram and love that they serve cold pressed juice.  Do yourself a favor and eat healthy and/or happy at Skinny Fats!!!"}
{"text":"First time at SkinnyFats in Las Vegas. The stars I gave this establishment speak for themselves. I wasn't even half way pleased. Arrived at about 4:45 on a Sunday, well before their 6pm closing time. First walking in, I noticed the drink machine was behind the counter. Oh helllll no. If I'm going to pay $2 for a small drink, I want to fill it up MYSELF when I want. I shouldn't have to go wait in the outrageous line just to have my drink filled. I proceeded to order the chick-a-waffa-dopalis (best spelling I could manage). It's their chicken & waffles. Lemme tell you, I love chicken & waffles so my expectations were high. I also ordered a side of sweet potato truffle fries. My chick&waff didn't take too long so when it got to the table I was optimistic. Good sized waffle topped with a good amount of boneless chicken strips. Unfortunately, I firstly noticed that there was barely any syrup AT ALL on top. I had to ask for a side of it. I first took a bite of a chicken strip... Delicious!!! The small amount of syrup was just enough to make the tender chicken have a sweet taste. This turned out to be the only part of my experience that I enjoyed. I then proceeded to try the waffle.... It was barely even warm. Borderline cold. Terrible. I had to take bites of the chicken and waffle at the same time just to make it seem like the waffle was warm. Oh and the sweet potato truffle fries?? Halfway into my meal and I still haven't received them, but my friend had gotten his. What's worse than that? I also hadn't received my drink half way into my meal. That's absolute horrible service. A lady walked by and my friend asked for a side of syrup and she quickly turned and said ok and I tried to ask for my drink but she quickly turned and hurried to the back. Very rude. So about half way into my meal, I have a completely cold waffle, no more chicken, no fries and no drink. Will not return."}
{"text":"Been meaning to come here forever! It was one thing or another that delayed me trying this place but finally I made it! Glad I did too! Lunch hour here is crazy busy! Good thing Mel & Terri R was able to snag a table for us since they got there early.  Everything off the Skinny /Healthy and Happy/Fats side sounded really good! I ended up getting two entrees! Bonjour Brulee a breakfast entree and Beets by Goat a salad entree off the \"Healthy\" menu side.  I chose the Skinny side not because it was the healthier choices but because I love goat cheese and arugula incorporated in my salads and beets too!  And when the Bonjour Brulee french toast topped with fresh berries, drizzled in agave was presented to me, I was impressed! So I had no regrets with my choices! Both salad and french toast were delicious! It also came with two silver dollar turkey sausage patties which I skipped.  I took a bite and didn't like it anyways. So I can do without that. The juices and shakes sounded good but were on the pricier side. As much as some of the entrees. So I can do without that too.  It's a fast casual restaurant. Place your order at the counter and they'll bring it to you when it's ready. I don't think the dining area is small for the space it's in. There's enough tables. It's just this place is so popular! That's a good thing though right?? The turnaround for a table here can be a while during the lunch hours then again, it's busy all day!  The line to order during the time I was there was out the door long! So I highly suggest you call or use the app you can get for your phone to place your order and pickup will be quicker. Yelp app or online has a place also where you can order for delivery or pickup!  Parking wasn't really a problem, that's if you park further away from their store front and don't mind walking a little more.   Location in an industrial setting is pretty innovative if you ask me. What a great idea for a start up business, it's probably more cost effective to lease space here. I so would find it a bonus having a restaurant nearby my workplace. It wasn't too hard to find the place for me. Your visual cue is (NB on Dean Martin) the  \"Post Commerce\" sign on the corner of the industrial lot Skinnyfats is located. If your SB on Dean Martin, it's just past the railroad track crossing. Entrance to Skinnyfats is facing I-15.  From what I noticed all the people who were on their lunch hour, no one seemed to mind waiting for their food, waiting in line, or waitng for table or waiting at all! Must be they've ate from the \"happy\" side of the menu alot. Just know there's a wait, but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. SkinnyFats catered an event I attended last weekend, and the food was amazing. We had burgers, chicken sandwiches, some kind of tofu dish, and salads, and everything I tried was wonderful. The chicken sandwich had thick, flavorful bacon on it, and the servings were HUGE. I loved the bread they used for the sandwiches, and they arranged the salad toppings into peace signs which was totally cute. I will say that the burgers were definitely rare, which I think is the best way to eat beef, but I think it bothered some people. HUGE portions, delicious food, and the catering staff was punctual, friendly, and efficient. I'd love to have SkinnyFATS cater every event I go to - they're awesome!"}
{"text":"Cherry popper was a good messy burger. The Spicy Latina soup is to die for. The music inside this place makes you want to get up and dance while waiting for your food. Only negative thing I can say is that this place is small and the sun beams right through the cheap window tint they attempted to throw up. So around 2pm when the sun hits the right angle, I do not recommend sitting next to the window. They need to put an awning up."}
{"text":"Fun place! I can go there when eating healthy or when down and dirty.... food on BOTH menus is good... only neg is location...."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend, decided to check it out and was not disappointed! This is one of those places you order at the counter and then sit down and have your food brought to you. Service was excellent. I had the fried pickles which were delicious and I highly recommend it. However for my main dish I got a buffalo chicken salad which was not my favorite, however edible. My friend got a beef teriyaki bowl which she reported was good, but a bit on the spicy side. Overall I will return, but I'm going to try something else next time."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious, especially the grilled cheese sandwiches with a tomato soup!! The staff was very nice to help me to order. The coffee was free when you order some food. I'll definitely try the other foods soon."}
{"text":"First off this place gets busy & has limited seating because of how packed it can get. It is located a bit out of the way however it is definitely worth the drive because the food is just that good. The interior decor of this place is really nice to, definitely some interesting things to keep your mind occupied while you wait for your food. The aesthetically pleasing interior combined with impeccable cleanliness to this place made me feel comfy and at ease.  I was fortunate enough to chat with the owners a bit (skinny & fats) and these guys are super down to earth and stoked on any input from the customers. They are on site regularly and take pride in their food. They are constantly doing specials and making all kinds if secret menu items (chicken and waffles is a must). As far as the regular menu goes it is creative, well done, and most likely inspired by some pot smoking.   The idea of choosing skinny or the fat side of  menu is a great edge to this spot and you can't go wrong whichever way you go. Also the employees here are great to, nothing but smiles from all of them!  All in all I have nothing but great things to say about this place. Yes it gets crowded and yes seating can be a pain and yes it's a bit off the beaten path. But it is worth putting up with these three issues, good food at goo prices are hard to come by these days."}
{"text":"Skinny fats is amazing! Dylan S. was so on top of giving the best service to my friend Ally and I. We enjoyed the experience immensely. Aside from the great food, the great service made the whole dining experience excellent! Thank you to Dylan!   -Cindy and Ally"}
{"text":"The truffle fries were really good. However, I had to take one star away because the produce on the burger wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Followed SkinnyFats on FaceBook & Instagram and always wanted to try this place.  Have to say hands down.  AWESOME!! You can either choose from Healthy Side or a Happy Side menu - Which ever you choose - Both sides are really good! (:  Food is fresh and packed with Flavor.  Very Impressed and will be coming back more often."}
{"text":"A friend suggested SkinnyFats for lunch.  It was my first time here and it won't be my last!  There are two doors by the entrance.  One is glass and the other has their logo on it.  Go through the glass doors.  The other one leads you into their kitchen area.  Im guessing they probably don't want me back there.  Once you've chosen the correct door, it takes you into their dining area.  It is quite small.  Smaller than many places for dining in.  The employees are very good at cleaning the table off right away as soon as someone leaves.    Service here was great.  The two girls taking orders were very polite and friendly.  The others who were brining out the meals were also very kind in making sure you had everything you needed.  Gold stars for the employees here!  They have a great variety of options on their menu.  Breakfast, healthy menu and happy menu.  There are also many kinds of healthy juices to try.  So I went with the TBLT off of the healthy menu.  Just like a regular BLT but with turkey bacon and whole grain bread.  Of course I had to try their sweet potato fries on the side.  I was completely happy with the healthy sandwich!  They certainly did not skimp on the turkey bacon.  It was so delicious especially with their awesome fries.  The fries were brought out in a bowl.  I had enough to share with my friend!    This is one of the healthy places I wouldn't mind bringing my husband.  With the wide variety of choices, everyone should be happy!"}
{"text":"Went here at lunch time and the place is so small and was so packed there was no where for anyone to sit. Line up a couple of tables outside or something. It's hard to enjoy your lunch when you have no where to sit and then when you finally find a spot you feel you have to rush so someone else can sit there. The food was good. Their juices are awesome!"}
{"text":"Went there recently just for some hangover helper juice. Service was very friendly and the juice was superb. I even felt better after. Need to eat there soon as well as seeing their ads on Facebook very enticing. Love the whole feel of this place!"}
{"text":"So the first time I went here the food was beyond amazing. I got the Phatty Philly with truffle fries and my mom ordered the Ahi tacos so we split. Both were fantastic! Saturday we decided to go back for the second time. The experience was extremely disappointing. My husband and I ordered the Phatty Philly and Ahi Tacos to split. The guy informed us that the deeper Fryer was broken so no truffle fries and no Ahi Taco. However he did suggest the sirachi tacos so we agreed to give it a shot because he said he liked it. We agreed to a side salad instead of the fries (obviously disappointed).  When our order came the Phatty philly was good but it had no blue cheese or mushrooms inside which are two main ingredients. The side salad had chopped cucumbers in it which my husband was very specific in ordering no cucumbers  in the salad. They remade us a salad no problem and the house dressing was very tasty but the tomatoes were soggy. Now when I bit into the Sirachi taco I was expecting the same goodness as the Ahi Tacos but was caught off guard with how disgusting it was. I literally wanted to spit it right out my mouth. It was as if they hadn't seared the fish at all. It was a cold fish taco. Yuk!! Even though we had a bad experience I will give this place one more shot because the first time the food was so good. Maybe then I can give it a better review."}
{"text":"There is so much I love about this place :)  Just like the name, there's a skinny (healthy) side and a (happy) fat side of the menu, if you're reading this review to gain some insight of the skinny side, stop here.   Yes, you'll be paying a bit more for the foods here, but for the quality and taste, it's worth it. With that being said, definitely don't see me here every lunch break.   My favorite is the Filet-O-Fire ($14). When I first saw it, looked like it wouldn't suffice as a meal, but it was perfect. I love spicy food so it wasn't intense, but if you think hot Cheetos are spicy, have a drink just in case.   If you're a sauce kind of person for the fries, they have a variety to pick from and if you absolutely love it, can pick a bottle up for home. I love their fountain drinks since it's the cane sugar company. And if you have room, the caramel salted cookie is amazing"}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but great things about this place, so figured I'd give it a shot since they're opening one in DT Summerlin :)  Went with the Filet O' Fire and it was worth it  You can pick your own side and ordered the truffle fries. Loved how the fries were crispy and the burger didn't leave me feeling lazy. The sourdough was crispy (yes I love crispy things) and wasn't too spicy overall :)   For the limited space, there's a communal table that can seat a decent amount + outdoor seating. Everything on the menu looked tempting so I was torn between a couple...and don't forget the cookies by the register  definitely have to try one next time!!   The fountain drinks were different, in a good way and the cup you get is super cute....not sure if you're supposed to trash it or not.  10/10 will be back to try something else."}
{"text":"Amazing this place blows my mind. Creative inspiring fresh unique love love. Definitely coming back everytime we in town!!"}
{"text":"So bummed I've been here twice ordered some of my favorites and they were a bust. It's such a hit and miss now some of their items are delicious and some are just bad. Even their caulifire dish was gross last time I was here and how hard is to mess that dish up???Also their regular cola still taste horrible. Their cherry soda is ok."}
{"text":"Amazing food! This place has healthy food options and affordable. The only thing thing is the restaurant is a bit small and i wish they had nutritional info on their meals but as far as ffod taste you cant go wrong here."}
{"text":"Skinny menu, not so skinny menu. Ordered Cluck Moo from the skinny side of the menu. White egg omelette with shaved NY steak. Okay, the thought of ordering a non-yolk, white only, omelette has never been of interest to me, but that was damn good!  A little on the pricey side, otherwise I think I'd eat here every day."}
{"text":"Simple concept, executed well.  Service, cleanliness, taste & decor ...4 stars  Three locations, the Dean Martin one being the only one that doesn't serve alcohol.  Catering menu available.  This review is for the North Decatur location.  Skinny Fats is exactly what it states.  The photos below contain the menu boards.  The area in blue are the calorie counting healthy menu options.  The ones in yellow are selections for people who care about flavor alone regardless the amount of calories. The adjoining store front is their cold press juice selection.  Our choice was from the healthy menu and cold press juice side.    Prices for the food and fresh juices range between $4-13.   It's hard to say if I would frequent a place like this at home because I'm always at farmers markets gathering up goods to make this kind of food and do my own juicing. I liked seeing the calorie count next to the dishes in blue, it gave me an idea of calories I'm consuming when I make these  foods at home.  I usually go out if the food Im craving is too much trouble to make at home or I want to sample something to duplicate cooking at home.  Or if I just don't feel in the mood to clean my juicer.  Visiting the area, we found it to be an excellent find.  We will be back!  Loved the vibe.  As you enter, it's clean , organized and equipped with a well trained friendly staff.   You can tell they do get very busy by the amount of stanchions they set up to form organized lines.  They offer the entire menu throughout the day.  Breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Whatever your in the mood to have, there are no rules.  Nice, flexibility in dining major points.  Hours are 9-9 daily.  Easy peasy to remember.  Ambience, 5 stars...the space was warm and inviting with reclaimed wood, decor is cool, rustic and comfortable.  Music selection was great.   A place you'd want to hang out for a length of time if your schedule allowed.  The bar appeared to appeal to folks who dined alone.  It was a cross between what appeared to look like a bar and a diner cafe.  No one sitting on it ordered alcohol.  But then again it was 9am.  But then again who knows in Vegas?!  The crowd the same, a cross between young laptop users and an older cozy diner crowd.  Interesting  I can see this being popular for diners who want to dine together in the same restaurant but want totally different kinds of foods.  We ordered Wrap supastar-$10 Chicken, egg whites, avocado, pico, spinach all wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla covered in Cajun cilantro avocado crema Healthy & tasty 3 1/2 stars  Chickpea & quinoa soup Vegetable soup Healthy & delish 3 stars  It was huge, we should have shared.  Delicious juices  Two cold press juices, made fresh to order Vitamin extraction on the spot  Sweet ginger-$8 Apples, beets, carrots, lemon & ginger  Loved it 4 stars  Hangover remedy-$8 Apples,  cucumbers, celery, carrots, spinach, beets and ginger  Just what the doctor ordered. 4 stars  Service is quick, after you make your selection, you are provided a number and in the time you select a spot to eat, get settled...everything is promptly delivered to your table.    If your in the neighborhood, I recommend you stop in, even it's for just their tasty cold press juice. You'll want to linger just because they make you feel welcome despite how busy it can get.  I would however recommend they open earlier than 9:00am for breakfast."}
{"text":"Love SkinnyFats and I always bring my out of town friends here. There's good food on the menu for any time of day and I love the healthy hipster vibe. The Vegwich is my favorite and so healthy only ~350 calories! But I'll order the truffle fries which are amazing with their jalapeno ketchup as a cheat. I love this location! Service is a bit slow but that's only since the food is so freshly made. I wish this location were bigger!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! I took the suggestion of the  cashier and she hit it spot on! Great suggestion of something new on the menu! Friendly staff is also awesome!"}
{"text":"As usual you can't go wrong with this second location. Just stopped in yesterday for a late lunch with my husband & daughter & had another great meal.  I ordered the UnBRIElievable which was perfection! My husband ordered the Chix on Broadway & my daughter had the kids quesadilla.  We also ordered the smooth immunity shake which was amazing."}
{"text":"I come here frequently for lunch/dinner so I'm surprised I have not yet reviewed this place.  I live closer to the Dean Martin location but I always end up at this location. Much bigger with outdoor patio seating , but parking kinda sucks. This location is also open until a bit later , from 9 am to now 10 pm.  As for food- there are so many options , both good and bad eats depending on how you're feeling. There's always something for everyone. Never had anything I didn't like here. My favorite entrees are either the teri-ahi or steakation sandwich. Definitely get their sweet potato fries over the truffle fries and try them with their jalapeno ketchup. Their taco ahi-san is amazing , two tacos are enough to be filling.  They also have great smoothies and cold-pressed juices. Their smooth immunity smoothie reminds me of an orange julius , but better. I hate soda but their cream soda here is pretty good.  They also have a secret menu available as well as a different Sunday sundae every Sunday of the week :)  Average check is around 10$-20$+ depending if you get any sides or a drink. Pretty pricey but I love the food here. Always a go-to for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"So good, blew away my expectations, we went their upon recommendation so we're expecting it to be good. Customer service was great, food delicious, will definitely be back. I had the Hot Chix salad and my husband had the Poke. We both loved our meals and found our new favorite lunch spot. Can't wait to try some other menu items!"}
{"text":"Boy am I LIVING HAPPY after stopping in here for lunch today! The food was amazing and the best part was this young woman named Jenn ! She made my day with her contagious, happy smile :) She deserves a 10 star rating ! Keep on smiling Jenn, seeya next time !"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great concept, healthy food and not so healthy food under one roof! I've been here several times and everything has been delicious. The staff is extremely friendly, they great you right when you walk in and come back after they deliver the food to your table to see if you need anything else. What more an you ask for? I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Worth the wait. They made something so simple like chicken and waffles extremely tasty! Also their Chiamisu was fabulous. Fun, delicious, friendly. Great job SkinnyFATS."}
{"text":"Awesome food and good prices. I drive through Vegas all the time and this place is great when I'm looking for a quick place that is off the strip. Service is quick & friendly & the food is tasty"}
{"text":"I got the smoke in a bowl..it's alright...I thought it was gonna be something great...but it's just ok.."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying a big thank you to Lana.  She got in contact with me 30 minutes after my initial review.  My mom and I stopped in yesterday and had a wonderful experience.    Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive.  The restaurant was very clean.  Our food was awesome. We had the two different kinds of ahi tuna tacos. I loved the fried one. We also shared the cauliflower bites. The cherry popper burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had.  We will most definitely be back. I think this is my moms new favourite place!"}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write about how good they are because I want to keep this place all to myself! We stopped in twice... just 3 days apart because there was so much that we wanted to try. In total, we had the Chickhumm sandwich, Chix On Broadway sandwich, their handcrafted Cream Soda, #Merica, One-Eyed Monster and Cinnutella. EVERYTHING WAS THE BEST! The Cinnutella was on their rotating secret menu, but I hope they put it on their main menu!  Not only is the food FANTASTIC, the entire restaurant is on point with their branding and attention to detail. They break the menu down into a \"healthy\" section, as well as a \"happy\" section. Brilliant and clever!  I also have to say that their juice bar was top notch. I had the Liquid Defense and my husband got orange strawberry juice. They come in reusable cups, complete with a \"happy meter\". Again; funny, clever, well branded!  Bottom line: GO HERE NOW! You won't be sorry. In fact, you'll probably be back in a couple of days!"}
{"text":"Love the food and love the concept but hate the fact that you can't eat there at peak hours without it being a huge ordeal.  I highly recommend the food but this is not someplace you want to go if you don't have time to wait for a table.  The place probably seats 25 comfortably with a MAX of 10 tables. When you walk in as a first timer, it's overwhelming because there are people standing everywhere, you don't know who's in line, and it takes forever.  Service is great once you get to the counter and they turn over tickets pretty quickly.  I would go there ALL OF THE TIME because the food is fantastic IF I knew I could sit down to eat my food without having to bargain or finagle for a table.  And god forbid, you get one out from under someone unknowingly.  Otherwise, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Awesome and unique eats. The ambiance is super cool too. It can get super busy so be sure not ti come in starved as it may take a bit to get seated but ao worth the wait. The fresh juices are amazing and the service is great. Price point is ok, again you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I come here often and the last couple times I have come in to get food before a going to work. One of those times the line is out to the door and they only have one girl on the register. Everyone else is kinda just moseying around. One girl is slowly doing roll ups, I see a couple employees walk past the register and no one ever acknowledges there's a line. I wait about 25 mins IN LINE to order food. It was honestly one of the most aggravating me experiences when it's clear that another employee should be in the register too, it's busy enough! Then I wait for 20-25 minutes for CHICKEN TENDERS AND FRIES. At one point I was like I'm sorry I didn't realize it would take this long for food. And I'm like I have to go. Just cancel my order. And the girl working as the expeditor says it'll be up in just a minute. Well I came an hour before work and I have no food so I have to go. The next time I called in my order, thinking it would be faster. They don't give me any instructions on how or where to pick up my food. So I obviously stand in line and wait to get to the register. I'm in like for 15 MINS and I see people just going right up to the counter and picking up food/paying!!! So as I'm standing in line I flag down an employee and tell her I have ordered food to go and I need to pay. She brings out the food and points to the register and was like she will ring you up. I was like well I have to go, I thought about just leaving the food bc I really did not want to waste my time. The girl, Nichole I think her name is, ends up taking my payment. I've never not tipped them but I did not tip this time bc I was so peeved. The food is good but it takes too long to order and if you order to go it seems to be an issue. I really don't know if I'd come back. I've talked to a couple of my friends and they all had the same reactions about this location, IT TAKES FOREVER."}
{"text":"COLD ASS WAFFLE!!! I normally come to this place a few times a wee month, so I'll say that I love it, but today my breakfast left little to be desired. First time here for breakfast ... they should stick to making yummy burgers. My waffle was cold, like it had been sitting out for ages and my chicken wasn't seasoned at all. I had to douse it in Cholula sauce.... I'll stick to breakfast places from here on out! So disappointed"}
{"text":"Everyone at the Farmers Insurance Office I work at love this place. I also do Uber and Lyft. I've noticed that I drive a lot of tourists to the Dean Martin location. I finally decided to try the Summerlin location. Wow!!! I was very impressed.  Better pack an appetite! The wait on a Saturday can be 30 minutes or longer, to order your food. Every minute worth it.  I ordered the Turkey burger which was beyond expectation! The portion was HUGE! I could only eat half, and took the rest home.  The flavor was amazing. I want to try everything on the menu. The atmosphere is very fun and lively! Great music and Vibe. They have employees working the dining room, immediately cleaning tables. My favorite was the cool Salt and Pepper Shakers on every table!  I wasn't a huge fan of the soda there. I'm partial to Pepsi and Coke, but wouldn't stop me from going in. Most people may really like trying something different. Be prepared to spend at least $10.00 per person. Worth every penny! If you're in Vegas, this is a place you should definitely try."}
{"text":"This is my go to brunch place any day of the week. The food is amazing and it's healthy (skinny side) depending on what you order. The service is fast and prompt. The ambiance is casual and friendly. You can sit outside in the back yard area or in the restaurant. Saturday and Sunday morning are jam packed with people, so there might be some waiting. My and my fiance's favorites include buff chix, ahi tuna sandwich, smotherload burrito, slow boat to china, and their soups. They also have good sodas made with real cane sugar. Overall this is my favorite place to go to in the south west side."}
{"text":"Omg I love this place. Went twice in Vegas. So cool on the inside and the food is so good, especially the buffalo cauliflower yum I wish we had a SkinnyFats  in Denver I know it would do well!"}
{"text":"Great place for something unique.  Too popular for their smallish size, but we were able to squeeze in on a Tuesday at 1pm without too much issue.   They're in a little corporate park and look completely out of place, so you'll think you're in the wrong spot until you see them.   The Spudghetti wasn't quite as good as it sounded, but everything else was awesome.  I'll definitely go back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Best semi-fast food I've had in EVER! The Sweet Cheese Us, Cherry Popper, Truffle Fries, and Slaw Chee are bomb!  Truly delectable.   Quick service, one of the coolest environments to sit and eat.  Splendid vibes coming from the speakers, quiet enough to to hold a conversation and hear the music without being over powered by the people sitting around us.  Definitely a place that makes me want to try EVERYTHING on the menu...Challenge Accepted!"}
{"text":"Pretty pricey. Got the Stakation burger, no side with a cream soda. Over $15 bucks. This is a place you go w that vegan friend you can't take anywhere else. Great vegan pizza and burger option. Small crowded place. Good for healthy, hip crowd. Food was good but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Only one word can describe skinnyfats Amazing. Food quality is great and service was great. The chicken sandwhich and sf tacos were killer.  The only downfall to this place is it needs more seating and maybe a beer menu. Great job skinnyfats you guys need to open acouple other locations."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the new location. I love this location - the inside decor was so cute! The \"grassy\" areas outside were a really nice touch. I went during lunch time so it was not crowded. When it was my turn to order, I was still struggling to pick something to eat. The lady at the counter really helped my boyfriend and I in picking something delicious even though it took maybe ten minutes haha She was very patient and smiled the whole time. My friend had accidentally ordered something wrong and the waiter was really accomodating in making it right and making sure she enjoyed her meal."}
{"text":"Great tasting food. Although I think they had their portions confused when we ordered something 'fat' and it looked 'skinny'."}
{"text":"A.MA.ZING. The Wake n Bacon is what breakfast sandwiches wish they could be. The kick of the pepper jack cheese and siracha cream cheese combined with the velvet avocado and (perfectly cooked) bacon give it a richness that is insanely irresistible on a brioche bun. The eggs were wonderful. I got it with a side of the house hummus and cucumber slices, and it blew my mind. Also a tip, dip the CauliFIRE into their house hummus for an incredible flavor combo of awesomeness. Their skinnyFATS punch still has me coming back though. Now all that's left to do is eat my cookies and come back again. It's all so good here."}
{"text":"Took over 20 minutes for a BLT and the fries weren't that great. Didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Simple but yummy ,good service I like the mojo ,good quality food, I like the fact the you can chose between. Fat and Healthy options"}
{"text":"If theres ever a restaurant I can commend for its near perfection, this is the spot.  Customer/guest service: 5/5 They always interact with you with a very lively and happy attitude. They ensure that you have a smile on your face coming in and coming out. Oh and of course while youre eating your food.  Food: 5/5 Without the food, skinnyfats will not be the place that it is known for. A place specifically designed to provide healthy or unhealthy, I mean happy, options. My favorite: chix on broadway. Very tender chicken in buns along with either truffle oe sweet potato fries.  Location: 3/5 Very random location. In a very secluded industrialized commercial center off of the 15 freeway between russell and tropicana. In ny opinion, the location is the only thing keeping this business from its potential. However, the unusual location does not give me reason to subtract stars.  Great food,l and great service. This place has it going and if youre ever in the city, avoid the buffets along the strip and come to skinnyfats where you will experience something unlike other!"}
{"text":"Pretty cheap and delicious. This definitely has the feel of a locals place and is a perfect place to come get breakfast, especially if you're on your way out of town. But service can be quicker :("}
{"text":"OVERALL WOW! I was very impressed by how quickly the new location was built, and even more excited to see the new mural inside. That is one of my favorite things about SkinnyFATS, I love the murals/artwork/decor and overall ambiance of each location. The staff is always very attentive, and informative (I love how they let you customize anything on the menu to make it perfect for you).  I ordered the Blaze of Thunder, and a side of Truffle Fries, also an order of the Fats' Pickles, and the Dem Greens.  The Blaze of Thunder was spicy, but paired perfectly with the Brioche bun and creamy slaw. I asked for extra pickles and it was a good choice, because they were delicious.   This got me hyped to move on and try the Fats' Pickles. These are fried pickle chips ( vs. spears) and they are perfectly seasoned, and breaded. I asked for extra of the aioli (I use it for the Truffle Fries), and almost finished the pickles off before realizing I had two more items!  The truffle fries are my staple side go-to, and always ask for them extra crispy. These are a perfect pair with any of the burgers/sandwiches, and one of my favorite things to get at SkinnyFATS regardless of my order.  I saved the Dem Greens for last, and truly love this salad because of the dressing. It is a truffle caper vinaigrette, and pairs perfectly with the capers and cherry tomatoes in the salad. SkinnyFATS also has my favorite ranch dressing on the planet, and I hope one day they will bottle that up like their ketchups! (I LOVE THEIR BOTTLED KETCHUPS).  Overall great visit. Very excited for this location (closer to my house).   A"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS has a little bit of something for everyone. Their menu consist of the 'healthy side' for me who was craving one \"healthy\" meal while on vacation, and the 'happy side' for my hubby who loves all things fried, greasy and delightful.   All cravings are welcomed. You can crave steak, scrambled eggs, meatballs, chia pudding, and whatever, and they prepare those items both ways, the 'healthy way' and the 'happy way'.   We tried a breakfast bowl with scrambled egg whites, turkey sausage and a variety of vegetables (healthy side). It was light, fresh and hardy. They also serve the breakfast menu all day which is nice since it was noon but I wanted a breakfast item.   We also tried the 'Chix on Broadway' and 'Pimp Shrimp' (happy side). The 'Chix on Broadway' came with a very lightly and crispy breaded chicken with cheese and aioli between two buns. The chicken was juicy and tender. The 'Pimp Shrimp' was pieces of tempura shrimp and spicy slaw and cilantro pico sauce on top of a whole skinless cucumber. The cucumber was refreshing after bites of the fried shrimp and spicy sauce. The sweet potato side was amazing that I couldn't stop eating it. It had bits of sugar that enhanced the sweetness of the potatoes and I highly recommend this side.   This place is ways off the strip but can be reached by driving (plenty of parking) or uber/lyft. The inside is so vibrant with colorful drawings on the walls and symbols to promote healthy and happy living."}
{"text":"I thought why not try it a lot of my friends were talking about this place. I have to say it's so good. I ended up trying the cold pressed hangover remedy and it tasted so good. I also got a something naked bowl which was delicious. I have to say I'll be coming back way more often"}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is BOMB! there really is no other way to put it. Every single thing on the menu sounded delicious and picking what to eat was beyond difficult. The dude working the register was super helpful, explained a ton to us (first timers) and made some really good recommendations. We were not at all disappointed. I got the cheese steak (i forget the menu name =/) and my fiance got the cherrypopper, and holy sh*t, they were SO good. The cheese steak was actual, tender, juicy, delicious meat, the cheese sauce was to dieeeeeeeee for and the peppers, onions, and shrooms were just ugh. It was SO good! Idk what was on the house salad, but it was absolutely delicious. Simple, but everything you could ever need or want in a side salad. The burger was cooked to perfection, the cheese, the egg, ugh, it was all just DIVINE! The truffle fries were bomb too! Washed it all down with a fresh strawberry lemonade ( you get free refill) that was perfectly sweet and sour. The atmosphere here is also super dope. They have booth seating, outside seating, a community table, and bar style seating. It's super chill, the staff was all super duper nice, and the food was just amazing. I honestly can't wait to go back. Love that they have a healthy side( everything is 600 cals or less I believe) and a \"happy\" side to the menu too. Will absolutely, positively be back next time I'm on that side of town!"}
{"text":"I like the concept of their being a healthy menu and a happy menu. I had the bbq chicken sandwich and hummus with cucumber. It was healthy and filling. If you are looking for a quick bite to eat that is good for you and is decently priced, this is it."}
{"text":"This place is perfect! Great for families, fitness buffs, foodies, etc. Everyone is so nice and helpful. The food is healthy and delicious (at least on the healthy side). I've never had a long wait."}
{"text":"This was a great first find! The food, presentation, and staff were amazing. When you're heading back to LA, exit off the 15 and have a bite to eat. Not too expensive but it's not cheap. The flavor is definitely worth it's price. I wouldn't recommend it for larger groups since seating is limited but you should probably call in before if you're with a large group.  5stars in my book! I will be back again"}
{"text":"One of the best off strip casual breakfast/lunch in Vegas. Great food, relaxed environment, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Get over to SkinnyFATS NOW!!! The menu has an awesome selection and it's all delicious! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. The food, the decor, all of it. My default is the Ahi Srirachi. It is so packed with yummy raw ahi and deliciousness that one is enough. I work literally 3 minutes away and would be there every day if the space was bigger-- there is always a line, and only a dozen or so tables. You can order for pickup (tell a person with a headset you are there to pickup--don't wait in line!) but there is only one little picnic table outside, in the parking lot essentially. Good specials, yummy smoothies, large portions, good breakfast, interesting flavor combinations, jalepeno ketchup, great burgers. Need a sign on Dean Martin coming from the south though: it is really easy to miss the driveway and there is no left turn lane. And hallelujah: no styrofoam!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Oo ya can't say anything bad about this place. Food and service is amazing!! First timers from out of town. My wife, son, daughter in law, and grandkids enjoyed the experience. The ahi sandwich, and the moo bowl were incredible!! Kids menu was great too. See you soon!"}
{"text":"NOM NOM NOM!   Saw this resto on Yelp and Instagram. Very appealing pictures but they don't do the food justice.  Was with a group so was able to try a few different things on the menu. Ordered from the healthy AND the happy sides :)  *Happy Mess: bf says it's like a healthier version of carne asada fries *Chix on Broadway: chicken was juicy and the batter wasn't greasy, plus! *Phatty Philly: tender meat and succulent portobello *Burger Benedict: wow! the egg was the \"cherry on top\" *Ahi Srirachi: loved the freshness of these fish tacos!  For drinks, gf got the How Now Brown Cow (twist on root beer float)... and I got the Jazz Hands (Sprite and mangoes). There were cut up strawberries and mangoes, in our shakes, respectively. We both agreed we liked the weird fizz feeling when chomping into the soaked up fruits =P  This little gem is off the beaten path of the Strip and the other main streets of Las Vegas. Lucky for me, it's within a 5 mile radius of my house! I'll be sure to make another trip back to Skinnyfats in the very near future."}
{"text":"Random date night and we ended up here. I ordered off the \"skinny\" menu and my husband ordered off the \"fat\" menu. We both were pleasantly surprised how delicious everything was. The restaurant itself had a nice feel to it. It was crowded but didn't feel like it was. The staff was very kind and helpful."}
{"text":"I went to the original skinny fats several times and loved it but this one is two streets away so I figured I'd check it out! I got the same thing I always get the cherry popper burger. Honestly I was so disappointed. It did not taste half as good as the ones I've had at the other location, which really bummed me out."}
{"text":"Oh SkinnyFats, I wish you weren't near Stateline.  Okay, I know it really isn't that far, but it sure feels like it whenever I drive there.  In any case, I like the decor of the place, however, I always feel like we are all a bunch of cramped herd whenever I'm there.  They really don't have much space in there and I don't know about you, but I really don't like to have asses on my face while trying to eat.  Okay, perhaps some asses I don't mind but I'm sure you get the point.  The space thing makes me want to give them 4 stars, but their great food and awesome customer service make up for that.    I've been there many times and although they have a pretty wide variety of food, I've always stuck to their Cranburkey.  It is a Turkey & cranberry patty wtih arugula, tomato, red onion & cranberry yogurt on a wheat bun, however, I get mine minus the onion.  It was literally love at first bite.  They have one of the best, if not the best Turkey Burger I've ever had.  I'm actually obsessed with it!  The patty is always cooked to perfection and it is never too dry nor too over cooked and it is always bursting with flavor, and the bun is also always on point.  I hate whenever I take a bite of a burger and the bread is so buttered up that it overpowers the taste of the patty.  I also get a side of their Truffle Fries and honestly, those are usually a hit or miss.  Sometimes they are just way too oily, and although I like them, they usually give me heartburn for some reason.  However, I'm not really trekking 100 miles for their fries."}
{"text":"Needed something good to eat while out shopping with mom. Stopped here based on the good reviews and wasn't disappointed. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good, affordable, and friendly staff! Our usual order is the Happy Mess (steak slices, fries, and fresh salsa) and the Three Healthy Chicks (egg whites, cranberry patty and wheat toast). They have a creative menu--there's a healthy side and happy side. They also have a great selection of self serve fountain sodas (by Boylan) and teas at this location.   There's outdoor seating (beautiful!!) and a projector indoors. It's a must try spot for anyone that hasn't tried it before!"}
{"text":"Pros: - Excellent service - the staff is very friendly and helpful.  - Fun restaurant atmosphere - colorful wall decal and good music.  Cons: I tried the Rosemary Jane, 3 Healthy Chix, Nice to Greek You, Buff Chix, Truffle fries, and Wrap Superstar and all were just Ok. If I had to pick one to have again I'd pick the Nice to Greek You. Overall the flavors were bland even though the dish descriptions sounded awesome.    I wouldn't come back here just for the food."}
{"text":"This place never lets me down. The selection  and the service are great. I try something new each time I'm here!   If you're a foodie then this is a place you must go to!"}
{"text":"Really cozy place. Order your food and pay before you sit is always nice! You can \"eat healthy\" or \"eat happy\" with the two sides of their menu! But no matter what you choose it will be great! An awesome choice for anytime of the day!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I've been dying to try it for months and finally got an opportunity to do so. Both my friend and I ordered Smoke in a bowl and ate every single bit of it. Looking forward to going again and trying everything on the menu.  Worth the wait during lunch time, and I say this because the line was out the door by 12:15pm."}
{"text":"\"Healthy\" side of menu is just as attractive as \"happy\" side!  If I close my eyes, it tastes like I'm back in San Francisco.  The \"flat chix and greens\" made me happy.  Very happy."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were absolutely amazing. Everyone is super friendly and the food is great. It's a great place for anyone who is watching what they eat but hanging out with people who aren't. There is something for everyone. The Skinny side of the menu is where I ate from both times and both times it was so fresh and clean. I can't wait to go back. Whoever thought to make a place like this...well done. Not only is the food amazing, the drinks are too. The atmosphere and decide is also perfect along with hanving great staff. I wish there was one closer to where I live but I will still drive 25 mins to get my Skinnyfats on. Thanks."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday this year and I must say..I was loving the place right away. Walking in I could tell it was going to have so much personality..and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere was so fun and vibrant. I couldn't stop smiling. I ordered the Mean Bean with Cauliflower Rice and the SkinnyFATS Punch. The Mean Bean and the punch were absolutely delicious. The cauliflower rice though...I didn't so much care for. My friend got the sweet potatoes fries and those were delicious. The different kinds of ketchup are a awesome little touch too. And...I'm just gonna say it...I'm in love with the salt and pepper shakers. So fricken cute. I can not wait to get back here and try everything on the menu...the \"healthy\" side that is. I'll just have to make sure to bring my \"happy\" friends to try the other side of the menu."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the meltdown with sweet potato fries. Service was good. It was way to cold outside to have the doors open though"}
{"text":"What's not love! The food is downright awesome. Can't go wrong with \"The Classic\" with their infamous truffle fries. Love the atmosphere too. It's just good vibes all around. I also tried both the Liquid Defense and the Hangover Remedy fresh juices and they were great. Here's the kicker that I appreciate...they got killer customer service and always greeting you with a smile. Thanks again SkinnyFATS!! You guys rock."}
{"text":"Overhyped. Underseasoned food. We got a burrito covered in cheese sauce and a noodle bowl with tofu. We were constantly reaching for the salt shaker. Cramped dining area. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The one thing I don't do often enough is eat breakfast.  So on a recent trip to Vegas, I decided that I'm going to add breakfast on my to-do list :)  After Yelping a couple of breakfast spots near where I was staying, I decided upon SkinnyFats and I was not disappointed.  The overall decor and ambience feels utterly San Francisco-ish:  just my kind of vibe.    I love that there are two sides to the menu:  the Skinny side and the Fat side.  So if you happen to go with other people who have a different eating agenda/philosophy, this place will definitely mediate that situation.  Though my inclination was to go ahead and order off of their Skinny menu, the vacation part of my mind overruled such thoughts.  I decided upon the country fried steak since I wanted to try something I don't normally eat.  I also tried the chicken and waffles, along with the sugarbetes-inducing banana, chocolate chip pancakes.    Here's more of the breakdown:  Country Fried Steak:  Yum.  The \"Steak\" itself consists of layers upon layers of thinly sliced New York steak encased in a crunchy, well-seasoned batter, fried to perfection.  It is carefully positioned on a bed of biscuits and topped off with a smothering of country gravy.  Eggs (cooked however you like) accompany the dish.  Every component of this dish synced nicely together.  The steak tasted like a better rendition of your grandma's home cooking.  I suppose it's a cleaner-tasting, more professional reboot of the country classic.  Chicken and Waffles:  Chicken and waffles is a classic dish in its own right.  I have tried the infamous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles and I was not impressed, as I think two things make the dish:  moist, melt-in-your-mouth chicken and light and crispy waffles.  My visit to Roscoe failed at both.  So what is it like here?  The chicken is moist, but very meaty and the waffle is crispy, but not as light as I would have preferred.  I still think the best chicken and waffles can be found at Bruxies (out in SoCal).    Banana Chocolate Chip Pancakes:  It's good.  It's a sweet concoction.  I would never be able to finish a whole order by myself, but I could see myself eating one or two bites.  Then again, I do not have a sweet tooth.  The verdict:  it was all good.  I will add this to my list of places to come back and eat whenever I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious food/juices. I have yet to try something I don't like on the healthy side of the menu."}
{"text":"Fist time at this place and it was way better than expected! Cute little hole in the wall, just off the interstate. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and made sure to make us feel comfortable. I ordered the Sweet Brown sweet potato pancakes...holy heaven in my mouth. I'm going to make sure to stop here every time I'm in town :) good job hipsters!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome staff. I highly recommend skinny fats if you are looking for a quick, healthy meal. I Love this place and would like to see more around town."}
{"text":"If I can come here every single day I would. I mean their food is delicious!! (The cherry popper) Especially if you're feeling fat one day you can decide to get a fatty burger or If the next day you decide you want to go on a diet and eat skinny you can still eat here. I love how they have fresh cold pressed juices for you to buy, and a whole selection of healthy food (,: price range is moderate, not too expensive but like $9.50 for juices. the workers are always extremely nice every time I have come here and the place is decorated like I don't even know how to explain but I feel small being in there and the outdoor seating is like a little backyard it's so cute. Oh! And I had to add they play all the best songs in here I wouldn't mind eating here everyday if j could only issue is that I think they should open later past 10 maybe at least 12! But this place is totally hipster and the food is actually really good so I'd definitely recommend for everyone to try this place out!!"}
{"text":"Very cool new place in the southwest that was in desperate need of a restaurant like this! Great concept, food was really good with an array of selections healthy and not. Decor was very inviting and fun and on top of it all the staff was extremely friendly and helpful! Will definitely recommend and return to enjoy other items!"}
{"text":"Food was alright. The French toast with cranberry patty left a bit to be desired. More patty than French toast. The Motherloader was kind of dry, and could've used more sauce in the center. Smoothies were good. Didn't get great service though. I got told to steal my table while I was ordering or my seat would get taken. Girl was looking out for me so I thanked her. From here we must've had some confusion with the order because a server got everything except the Motherloader. When I told him I didn't order that he got upset and went back to get me my order fixed. I got no silverware, no napkins, and when I asked for a straw he refused to look at me. He was so pissed, but I didn't do anything but order. That really kind of sat sour with me and although the food is healthy and hearty, the service was lacking."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times.  Great friendly service, with consistent food and affordable prices.   The \"Slow Boat to China\" is my favorite.  I also love The \"Cool-Mame\"  It's hot edamame dusted with a ranch powder and served with a ranch dressing dipping sauce.  The tomato bisque and chicken noodle soups are good as well.  The artwork is colorful which makes a happy atmosphere.  It can seem a little small and crowded when it's busy but it's worth it. The place is a hidden gem and can be a little hard to find even after you have been there.  I watch for the big beer bottle shaped sign on the Vegas Strip Side of the Freeway.  If you are heading South on Dean Martin it's on your right shortly after you go over the railroad track crossing."}
{"text":"I love this place!   Walk in,  place your order,  take your number to the table,  go grab your beverage,  wash your hands,  and they will deliver your order to your table.    The left side of the menu is the healthier stuff and the right side is the \"cheat day\" not as healthy stuff. Great outdoor patio dining with lots of seating. The food is consistent and the employees are always happy and helpful. They are always cleaning and on top of things. The vibe and artwork make this place unique and set it apart from your everyday boring chain style dining. Prices are affordable and food is addictive and tasty. Thumbs up!!! : ) Favorites are Slow Boat to China and the Flat Chix and Greens.     Yes, the salt and pepper shakers are adorable.  They have legs and choose not to run away so leave them on the tables where they live.  Let me say this again, don't be a scumbag and steal the salt and pepper shakers...buy your own!  They have a delicious looking kids menu for the little ones."}
{"text":"Came here again because a store representative did reach out to me due to my bad experience. I did decide to give it another try. This time I ordered the smoke in a bowl (healthy side) let me start off with the positive side: it was a good portion and I replaced the chicken with shrimp (got 6 jumbo shrimps) and the shrimp was so fresh super high quality which was my favorite part. Negative side: I wouldn't call this plate smoke in a bowl. This isn't what I expected when I ordered this I guess i expected more smokey / grilled flavors and ended up having a plate with more of a tomato saucey Italian flavor.   Besides that one thing I can say for certain is that their customer service has always been on top. I'll just have to hunt for a dish I enjoy."}
{"text":"Catching up on some late reviews! But went here yesterday and came out happy. It's a small place but to good food, although it's a by expensive but you have to remember quality over quantity :) the staff is extremely nice and very helpful in subbing items or helping you find the best dish for you. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Ok so the place is really small BUT the food is fantastic.  Truly quality stuff coming out of the kitchen.  Great flavors and totally different from the everyday normal. A definite must try. Come hungry plates are huge."}
{"text":"Love this place - we go here whenever we are in the area which is not often enough! They have a great selection of healthy food options, plus of course slightly unhealthy options also. We always go for the healthy ones, because otherwise whats the point in eating here in the first place! They don't have a ton of seating so just be wary of coming here during busy times. I can personally recommend the seared tuna burger."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome and serves great food. Only minor setbacks keep it from being 5 stars. Those setbacks are pricing and room. This location is tiny and I mean it. About as big as most one bedroom apartments. So a line could easily be out the door and crammed. It's a tad bit pricey but it's fresh food so what can you expect. The cashier I dealt with was very personable and fast at her job. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great, and the staff is always nice! Also... the cold pressed juices are awesome! Love the \"stop juice abuse\" concept! Thanks for keepin' it real SkinnyFats  I usually get the cranburkey, buffalo caulifire, or the black bean burger"}
{"text":"What is there not to love!! They add now custom made items monthly or daily it at random that I have noticed. Don't go often enough.  They have vegan friendly menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Unique menu options, comfortable atmosphere, and not too expensive. Call ahead if planning on take out."}
{"text":"Was surprisingly good, wasn't expecting much but was actually really surprised, food and staff where good"}
{"text":"This place has a great menu. Very eclectic. The food was excellent. We ate her twice while we were in town."}
{"text":"I am so sorry I haven't come here sooner!! It was all so good! The service was awesome . I had the cold pressed juice , immune defense - It had apple carrot, orange lemon lime and basil. My mom used to juice for a health food store making blends .. so this was super special . I haven't really drank those since she passed. It meant to my standard . I also had the swinterology which is off the happy menu a blt with cheese- no pepper jack for me.. It was tasty and the truffle fries were to die for  the locations are a little out of my way, but I'll make the trek !"}
{"text":"This is the 1st and original location of skinny fats! I must admit that I've heard of this place way before I experienced it and it doesn't disappoint!!!!! It's a happy medium between healthy and \"happy\"!   No matter what your diet goals are, there is something to eat here! There's also a secret menu that has new items and today was he day I took a stab at that.   First - had to order the \"punch\" it was a nice blend of tropical juices. I believe it was blended, because it was pretty thick. A couple of shots of rum would have made my day! Lol  Filet of fire- I can't even remember everything that was on here, but the flavor is popping! I honk they even season their bread!!! Medium rare filet of steak, avocado, fried jalapeño and pico de gallo. And you also get a side!!! Of course I went with the truffle fries!!! ***note to self..... If you dine in... They have their own jalapeño ketchup. A must try!  Hot mess- in short, buffalo chicken nachos!!!! Enough said!!!!!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed with a menu selection. Somehow they know how to make even the stuff I despise, taste great!!!    If you've never been here.... Here's a tip  You walk in, grab a paper menu and check it out even before standing in line to order. They have so many great things you'll have a hard time deciding on your first selection! There's a happy and a healthy side, although the happy side can also be pretty healthy. Both sides do not skip on flavor either. They've recently added a few things from their secret menu to he permanent menu, like the Filet o' fire. With your sandwiches you also get a choice of a side and my go to choice is always truffle fries, I'll go the sweet potato route if I'm being strict on my diet.   I always get a fresh pressed juice (liquid defense), but they also have soda that they make. So it's soda on the healthier side.  Also, they have infused water, if you just want a water cup.   When you dine in, your meal will be sent to your table on real serve wear and not plastic!!! They also clean the tables after you, so make sure to leave a tip!!!!"}
{"text":"This place. You must go. Even the \"skinny\" side is delicious. A little pricey but worth it. Have been here several times and we get the hot mess every time it's so good. Breakfast served all day but I can't get past the sandwiches and bowls. Can get a little busy and it's a small place so if you have a big group you might have to split up or wait a bit."}
{"text":"Still love this place. My new favorite is the \"nice to Greek you\".  This time I called my order ahead of time so it was ready when I walked in. Just had to wait a while to pay :("}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The food is great and so is the decor.  You can go with a health conscious person and each of you will be happy!  Great options for you both.    Also, you can each pay ypur own bill.  Saves sooo much hassle.  No figuring out who owes what.  The service is good too.  My salad arrived pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Much better experience this time with them. I had the turkey cranberry burger with regular fries. The chocolate chip cookie was good. The service was good the couple of times I came in, and even when they are busy they get your food to you in a decent amount of time."}
{"text":"I always like going to Skinny Fats. This was my first time at this location, which was trendy and hip. Got the Chix on Broadway (Breaded chicken, bacon, tomato, cheese and lemon aioli) and truffle fries. Service was great, food was delicious, atmosphere was casual and fun. Great place to grab good food at a reasonable price! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Place is so much friendlier than the other location. Way more seating options and an altered menu. On a strange diet right now to cut more fat and they were able to accommodate. Most places complain...not them- all smiles!!!"}
{"text":"The SMOTHERLOAD!!!!! I'm obsessed! I love this place! I go there during my break and their health drinks are a blessing. I haven't tried anything else yet because I'm still stuck on the smotherload. However, those cookies that look like melodies from heaven are going to be tried out next time I go there."}
{"text":"****Update, as mentioned before went back to SkinnyFats for dinner Saturday evening, once again perfect timing not very busy. The young lady at the counter was very patient, as I could not decide what I wanted. Husband ordered STEAKation, enjoyed it but said he wouldn't try it again. My son's favorite Cherry Popper was delicious as always. I had the Cranburkey, without cranberries, made to order excellent turkey burger. Overall great meal and customer service."}
{"text":"My roomie never had Skinny Fats before so being the awesome roommate that I am I decided to take him. When we got there it was busy busy busy practically had to fight through a group of frat boys just to get to the menu! Immediately I noticed the new gear the staff was wearing, it really compliments the joint. Anyhow, their frier was announced to be broken so I couldn't have my truffle fries. Boo! I think they did it on purpose to encourage healthier eating. My roomie ordered the classic burger always decent here and I got the Brussel Crowe which was very refreshing. Personally out of the many items that I've tried here I love their burgers & fries the most. Expect to spend at least $11-20 per person if you get an entree and drink. Food is ok but nothing really to rave about, but it is worth trying at least once. Highlight: I caught the US Vs Ghana World Cup game woot woot."}
{"text":"(The stars are for the food and the funny people sitting behind us) Well... the service sucked. First of all, there was worker by the name of Alex who completely disregarded us as we walked in and went to the next people in line as if we weren't there; on top of that, she walked around with a face that looked like she was annoyed of everyone that passed by. Furthermore, a girl who wasn't wearing her name tag continuously shoved through customers without saying excuse me. And don't get me wrong, the vegan food I ordered was still great! The customer service could just use some work  Also, there weren't as many vegan options as I would've liked and the seating was a mess"}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is an easy stop to go to for healthy food choices. I'm glad it exists. Especially their juices. After you go a few times you run out of healthy choices though. I love the design of the restaurant and the outside patio though."}
{"text":"So cool they have a closer place now. Came here for lunch and it was the BOMB!!!! Can't remember what  I had but make sure to look at the Ipad with the scrolling specials."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this place and I must say I made a wrong choice, the Chickewaffledopolis-something-like-that I ordered looked delicios but it was ok, dry and hard to swallow but it might have been my own fault, I hate maple syrup and I switched it for some berry sauce so it was not moist, on the other hand my wife ordered the \"Wake n Bacon\" with the breakfast potatoes and let me tell you it was very good, I want one now, the staff was very friendly but in my opinion the cashier was too much friendly but she was nice, they have couple sauces the Jalapeño one is good, not so spicy but I am Mexican so taste it first, my wife fell in love with the place so i'll say I will be back...  I need to try their tacos and we'll see..."}
{"text":"Excellent clean and fast. I enjoyed my visit. I had the cherry popper with truffle fries along with a hangover remedy (Even though I didn't have a hangover). It's pricey I won't lie but worth it. I love the fact that their menu is not the norm and I enjoyed every bite. I will be back to try some of the other fantastic items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch with very good food.  Get there before noon or you will be waiting for a table.  Great branding and great product.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"Cool concept. Accommodates multiple dietary needs or if you want to throw the diet to the wind. Everyone has a choice. No matter what, it's delicious. Excellent cup of coffee. Great find!"}
{"text":"Great little find off the beaten path, close by the airport but away off the strip. If you want fresh, farm to fork, organic with vegan options this is your place.  Little hard to find location, in a flex space industrial area, but it works. Fresh unpretentious decor, bright airy, love the tin ceiling tiles, rustic look with the decorative wooden pallets, shows their use of environmental friendly materials. The place only seat no more than ~40, so first come first serve to the tables and counter seating. We came before the lunch crowd at 10, they serve all of their menu items am/pm. I ordered the curry rice noodles with veggies, delicious sauce, roasted corn, peppers and chick peas, so flavorful, sliced fresh jalapeños on top for a heat kick. Hubs got the Turkey bacon, avocado, tomato club sandwich- fresh and tasty. Fresh water with lemon cucumbers- their sodas are all with sugar, wish they'd get a sugar free option. Counter girl was friendly and helpful.  Great breakfast options served all day - delicious healthiness!!  We will be back"}
{"text":"Wow is an understatement. This burger is the real deal. Fluffy and soft buns? Check. Huge burger? Check. Good fries? Settle down Skinnyfats, your competition is already dead    With the burger taking nearly 15 minutes to move made from an order, the quality of this place just makes it worth it.   Presentation wise Skinny Fats does it solid with every dish. I'm impressed with each dish. I may not have the best viewing angles of the foods but none of the pics can demonstrate the size of each food item. Honestly all of them are very large in portion and plenty for 1.   But onto the food taste, the most important part. This burger really shined on it. For such a large burger I wasn't expecting such a high standard but this burger nailed it. Bun was fresh and light, not too chewy while the patty was juicy and didn't spill over at ALL. IT DELIVERED.  The patty itself had me drooling and it was perfect. Flavor wise it knocked out of the park with a nice herby juice oozing out of it.   Decor is nice as well, even the outdoors when it gets 100 degrees out. Most of us were in shade so that helped.   The whole menu looked great and my friends all said they had a blast. Prices were reasonable for what you get.  I'll be back when I'm in Vegas again :)"}
{"text":"At Skinny Fats you must answer a difficult question of willpower and choose whether to be Good or Bad. They have a healthy side of the menu with dishes less than 600 calories right across from a happy side with 600+ calorie indulgences.   Walking up this skinny fats has a corner suite next to an open air shopping walkway in Downtown Summerlin. This location is different than the other two in that there is very little parking right outside but in my opinion this is the nicest. Like the southwest restaurant this one had a retractable glass wall that allows for open air dining.   They have many vegan, vegetarian, GF options that are clearly marked on the menu, making it super easy for people like me. Also you can sub grilled or fried tofu for almost all of the meats on the menu for additional vegetarian and vegan choices.   I ordered the \"Stuff on Curry\" which was pad Thai noodles with a curry sauce and fried chickpeas. My husband got the \"Hot Chix\" which is a salad with blue cheese deep fried jalapeños and ranch dressing and avocado with buffalo chicken. They were delicious, packed with flavor, and we will be back for more.   Just FYI no dogs, only service animals on the patio."}
{"text":"skinny FATS is  my new go too lunch place...   they have a great selection of healthy and less healthy entrees.   the happy side of the menu has a bunch of things you know   the flavors of everything have have had are very strong and well mixed...with a skinny fats twist..the presentation was fabulous.  this location also addressed the 2 biggest problems with the original spot...it is significantly larger and easier to find.. bottom line...this place is a must try for anybody who like or even thinks they like food!!!!"}
{"text":"Sooooooooooo delicious.  I had the s'mothered load and my wife had the cran burkey.  My wrap didn't look that big,  but I still couldn't finish it.  I enjoyed every bite and I'm certainly looking forward to trying other items on their menu.   My gripes.   -small spacing,  limited seats,  horrible lay out.  The line wraps against the wall behind people eating by the window.  It was soooo congested in there that I would probably consider going somewhere else where I can eat comfortably.  Other than that,  there was definitely a party in my tummy."}
{"text":"I checked this place out last night with the entire family. There was 5 of us.  I'm giving this a 4 Star due to a few things I believe they can easily improve on  Positives:  -Food is amazing.  Love the variety of flavors -Staff around the cooking section and the two guys were really cool. The guys both came by and asked us how the food was a few times but it could be because we sat right up at the high top counter  -Crayons provided to kids when asked. You have to know they provide these upon request. We have 3 kids from 2-7years old. Big plus for us  -loved the Special Benny that I ordered. Genius concept and so delicious!  This place has specials is what I'm told so you have to ask. Its not on the regular menu.   Negatives:  1) Not a lot of seats. I had to sit my 2 year old on me while sitting on the high counter seats next to the kitchen. Not comfortable at all but they were packed inside. Nobody sat outside.  I would suggest putting heaters or telling customers that there are heaters if they do have them.  Really do not want to eat with a 2 year old on my lap on a bar stool the whole time. That was annoying.  2) Did not like that their kids meals doesn't come with a drink. You have to purchase the drink and costs 1.95 if I recall correctly.  I have 3 kids. That adds up for us.  For this place to be a non waited service Restaurant, the 1.95 on top of the 4.95-5.95 meals can add up and I don't have a seat for my 2 year old. ... seems a bit costly.   (In my opinion, you can go to Lazy Dog and be able to order kids meal, be waited on with comfortable booths for everybody and it costs less.  Also includes crayons for the kids and their kids meals wont add the extra drink cost)  3) When we were waiting in line something happened three people before us that caused a stop in line for about 5 min.  There was only one person at the check out line with a huge line just adding up for ordering. I don't know what the issue was but it took a good 15-20 min to order your food. Then you gotta factor the wait time for the food to be cooked. Maybe just one of those random things we got caught in. Hopefully not this bad all the time and that's why I was comparing it to Lazy Dogs. After 20 min in line, I really don't want to have my 2 year old sit on me while I eat and scarf the food down as fast as I can.  Probably not going to come back again with the kids unless it's not busy or someone approves on seating. I'm not someone who can place my jacket and purse down and leave my 2,5, and 7 year old to reserve a seat while I order so I'm screwed."}
{"text":"Love the salt n pepper shakers... do wish more open seating... people when it's busy are a bit hangrey!! Food is always seasonal, fresh and OMG goood!! Some combos I normally wouldn't try have turned out to be my favs!!"}
{"text":"At our work, we get large takeout orders for team lunches from this SkinnyFats location. Our orders are always ready when promised, as well as all of the details are correct. The front counter employees are extremely friendly, the manager Dylan is amazing, and the store always looks very clean!! :) We love coming here and can always depend on the quality and freshness of the food."}
{"text":"Absoultey amazing ! You can't go wrong with anything you order here! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! They should definitely expand into a bigger place because the spacing is pretty small, but I love their menu and what they have. Also it's environment is great. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"My boss took me to lunch here because he claimed they had the best burger in town.   I could not finish it, because it was so big, but I have never had better. Service and food excellent."}
{"text":"Visited here again two days ago, and the Meltdown burger is so good it's almost criminal. Only down side, get there before Noon if you want a table. Like some users I also tend to go more for the Fats and not the Skinny."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Sometimes hard to get seats so patience is a must or just flat out luck but totally worth it! Parking is easy and free.  Totally recommended and cant wait for a bigger location to open up! Prices are fair and sizes are perfect."}
{"text":"Love it here. The new location is really nice and spacious and the staff is great as well. Everything I have ordered here is delicious, but the ahi sriracha taco is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, very upbeat girls working the front.  They are extremely helpful and smiley; they look like they enjoy working together.  The food was very good.  I ordered a classic burger and my boyfriend got a steak sandwich.  I was jealous over his sandwich, the filet used was very flavorful.  Prices are decent.  I think the only thing for me is I'm a huge French fry lover and I wasn't a big fan of theirs.  The fruit was a great side choice though! :)"}
{"text":"Called in an order for pick up last night, 7/28/17. I ordered the blueberry yum yum, classic burger with fries, 2 tacos, a peanut butter banana shake and the More Cow Bowl. Was told it would be about 15 minutes which was 5 minutes before they closed. Both people I interacted with were so awesome and had great customer service, the guy who took my order and the cashier (sorry didn't get names). While I was paying they called my name to pick up the order, didn't wait at all! The food here is so good, I definitely recommend the Blueberry Yum Yum if you're in the mood for French toast :)"}
{"text":"It was our visit and we were crazy hungry... The food was delicious and healthy too... The service was good too.The smooth immunity smoothie with frozen yogurt base was out of this world .. A must try"}
{"text":"Great concept with healthy options that are creative. Ask about their secret menu. Staff is everything!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere & very attentive servers. We were thoroughly pleased with everything we ordered. From the cold pressed juice blend to my Cranburkey Burger, everything was delicious & fresh. We started eating better recently & it was nice to eat somewhere that offered healthy options along with comfort food. We will definitely be back with our kids!"}
{"text":"First time here. The Hot Chix salad is awesome. A little spicy, but very delicious. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Skinny FATS is a clever restaurant concept with a nice, chic interior and a totally hip menu. The actual execution of the menu leaves a bit to be desired, however, particularly for the price.   I stopped in one day for lunch and decided to try the TATS (a play on a BLT with turkey bacon instead of regular bacon) and one of the ahi taco san tacos. I chose the truffle fries as my side.   The TATS was okay, but the bacon was lukewarm and flacid, the avocado was under ripe and the spicy \"yo\" was way too spicy for me. This was pretty disappointing as I love crispy turkey bacon. As for the taco, the tortilla was too chewy and the inside of the \"crispy\" ahi (actually quite soggy) was too cool and also chewy. On top of that, it really didn't have much flavor.  The truffle fries were nice and crispy but they definitely went overboard with the truffle oil. The second I opened the box, my entire office was overcome with the smell.  Overall, the TATS wasn't \"bad\" nor were the truffle fries. They just weren't really worth the price and not something I'd want to order again. The ahi taco san, I'd personally avoid. 3 stars."}
{"text":"The difficult-to-find location and parking already turned me off a little before I even walked in the door to a line that nearly went out of it. I can only imagine how busy this place must be given that I was there at 2PM on a weekday.   Line delay combined with small space led to many people standing around awkwardly with nowhere to sit after placing their order. I ordered to go, but standing for nearly half an hour was not ideal. Unable to determine if tables of people were waiting on food or lingering after finishing their meals.  Food: maybe I didn't get the right menu items to justify the hype but they have cut a lot of popular items from the menu so a few of the things I'd had my eye on are no longer options. Both the customers in front of and behind me in line had the same issue. Change is good when warranted, but when asked, an employee couldn't explain why they were no longer selling highly-requested dishes.  Opted for one of each of the ahi tacos- the ahi sriarchi and the ahi taco-san, one healthy and one happy.  Healthy one was lacking flavor on the actual fish: healthy doesn't mean you can't season the fish, Daily Wellness Kitchen manages a good seasoning on theirs. Additional toppings added flavor but I was underwhelmed by the blandness of the fish itself. The ahi taco-san was served on a puffy taco, which got soggy fast with the sauces and watery slaw topping. Flavors were a bit more pronounced with this taco, and I enjoyed the fish despite not generally being a tempura fan. The kitchen was heavy-handed with the mayo-based sauce.  I may come back another (carefully-timed) time to dine-in and try more options (is the cranburkey still there?), and the atmosphere seemed cool, but I will likely just wait until they move to a better location- management has commented that a larger 215/Rainbow location is in the works."}
{"text":"This location is brighter and more spacious than the Dean Martin counterpart- menu is the same at both locations, quality is good but not great, and pricing is kind of all over the place. There are several good deals to be had, but some may find the menu pricey for the portions. Menu includes healthy options and more standard restaurant fare, plus juices and breakfast all day.  I've had their fish tacos (both versions) before, but a healthy-side staple for me is the Nice to Greek You flatbread: plenty of toppings, good mix of flavors, portion is a big lunch or enough for leftovers later. Underwhelmed by the side of truffle fries. They're a generous portion, and crispy, but have very little flavor. I do wish they had a garlic fry option because I think they'd rock. A \"side\" of fries should be less than $3.50 and not big enough for an entire table to share, cut the portion and price to something more reasonable.  Staff are usually pretty friendly. Decor is trendy-rustic, kind of like an indoor picnic. Multiple seating areas, cool place to meet up with friends. Choose your food carefully, IMO many dishes have too much going on but there are some really solid options hidden in there."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas! Mom recommended this place, however found their food quite bland. However some of the best customer service I've ever had, very cute/stylish place. Everything was clean and the service took less than 10 minutes. It seemed like they focused more on the look and presentation of the restaurant than the taste. Not very impressed with the food."}
{"text":"Man, kayce from the warm springs location was bomb. The people here really take care of their customers and cater to food allergies. Love this place."}
{"text":"I came here on my birthday, seeing that they had a free birthday shake and reading all the great reviews and looking at the great pics of food. It wasn't to far from were we live and easy to get to. Great options if you want to eat healthy or if you want to be bad. I wanted to be both!! You have to go to the register to order. I told the employee I heard about them on Yelp. We gave her our order. I asked her if they did anything special for birthdays? She replied \"we just open a couple of weeks ago and we're still working on promotions\".  (Knowing I saw a pic on yelp for a free Birthday shake). I don't like to confront or argue with people because I work in customer service too, and I like to trust and believe they're knowledgeable about their job. Promotions change all the time.   I ordered the Ahi Srirachi with truffle fries, and How Now Brown Cow (Traditional root beer float). My husband ordered the Burger Benedict with truffle fries, and a Charlie Brown's shake with nutella. We sat down and admired the artwork on the walls. Service was pretty quick. My tacos had mango slaw and srirachi sauce took one bite and the flavors just burst into my mouth. WOW!! Didn't care too much for the truffle fries. My husband's burger was very juicy and fresh taste like a homemade burger!! Good service!!   I would have given this  business a 4.5 stars but a couple days later I read a review on yelp and saw a pic that someone else received their free birthday shake. Like I said before I work in the same business of customer service. I don't care about free things but it would have been nice. I just ask to be consistent and have your employees knowledgeable about promotions and if they don't know find out don't be lazy and make up excuses."}
{"text":"It was amazing and delicious. Loved the healthier options and the pressed juices, must go!"}
{"text":"Trendy spot, healthy food. Always good on quality with food on my end and what I order. Good wait times when dining in and glad it's on my side of town via Southwest Vegas, down the way from Roads Ranch."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place on a visit to Vegas.  SO glad we did. We will be back every time we come to town from now on. The menu is unique with many healthy options as well as more traditional items - something for everyone - and their shakes are incredible. I had one that had Nutella and bananas and it was so good - not normally a big ice cream shake drinker but this was so good that after I finished mine I went after my kids shakes too. . Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh, tasty and good for you. The menu goes on forever that I will need to come back a few times to try more!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once every 2 weeks. Food is AMAZING and always a great menu with different options. Smoothies are ok, but you can substitute that with their very cold and refreshing cucumber water. ;) I highly recommend their Happymess. BOMB.com!!!! Wish that this location was a little bigger being that it's always packed with limited sitting. Other than that, GREAT FOOD AND EXPERIENCE. Stay Skinny while thinking Fat."}
{"text":"This little spot is one of my favorites if I want to grab a reasonably priced healthy hot meal. My two girls love the children's menu. My favorite item is the \"\"chickhum\" and the \"smoke in a bowl\"! Both very filling low calorie calorie hot items. My family and I eat at skinny fats at least one a week and at one point it was 2-3 times a week. I even got customer over the month! Lol I give this place a major thumbs up."}
{"text":"AHHHHHHHHMazing.  That's all, literally, the people, the menu, the food!!!!! WOW.  I waited in line with a lot of other people, (my first time) and they were so happy to be there and helped me understand how the flow goes there - absolutely fabulous.  Loads of love and their motto, LIVE HAPPY.  Seriously, you will leave in such a lovely mood...can't wait to go back again, and again.  xx jen"}
{"text":"Wow! I've driven by this place for over a year and finally stopped in- a new favorite! Fresh juices, Vegetarian options, breakfast all day, something for everyone! The staff seems to love working here, everyone was very helpful, friendly & happy!"}
{"text":"The best of both worlds - a \"healthy\" and a \"happy\" side of the menu. Trying to eat healthy often means leaving a restaurant unsatisfied, well for me anyway. But I really enjoyed my \"Shroomin' in Philly\" sandwich, sweet potato fries and hot-mame. I worried that the flavor of the mushrooms (especially if they were portobello) would be too much, but that wasn't the case at all. Really good and filling!  The hot-mame was sweet and slightly spicy. It came with a soy looking sauce on the side, but we didn't use it because they were great as is!  My hubby got the Burger Benedict, which was also really good (also obviously on the happy side). His side was truffle fries, but he wished the truffle flavor was more pronounced.  It was busy when we got there, but luckily we got the last table. If you've read my other reviews, you'll see I appreciate details, so one other thing I liked was their cool, reusable, dishwasher-safe cups. It has a \"happy meter\" on the side that shows how full it is. Oh and they had jalapeño ketchup and balsamic ketchup on the table, which I've never seen before. The jalapeño was good, not too spicy!  Looking forward to my next visit back here!"}
{"text":"Location, location, location.  Not happening here.  Food, 4 stars.  Ordering online, 4.5 stars.  Restaurant seating, 2 stars. Speed, 3 stars. Sweet potato fries were great, but oily."}
{"text":"Lots of healthy choices as well as more traditional food.  Tried the Wrap Supastar first time that was really tasty. Second visit I tried the egg white and steak and out of these two the wrap is the winner.  Tried a couple various juices as well, really good.   Will come back."}
{"text":"Ate here today... sooo many options. The menu has a Healthy and a Happy section. We both ate off the Happy section. Food was amazing. Portions were large. Wonderful staff. I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with their food as it has a good mix of healthy and the not so healthy dishes. My go to is the Steaknation (correct me if I got it wrong). The burger has a good amount of meat and it's definitely a good sized portion. I love their sweet potato fries and you can't go wrong with the jalapeño ketchup.. yum! The service is friendly and they usually serve the food pretty quick. Some of the options are a bit pricier than other places, but the food is great!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Definitely get there early for lunch because the line will whip around the block if you snooze.   I ordered the Steakation sandwich from the \"Skinny\" side and couldn't believe it was under 500 calories! It was so delicious and super filling. It also came with a side, and I chose a salad, and the \"side\" salad was HUGE. That could have been a meal in itself!  We also treated ourselves to their vegan, gluten free red velvet cake and, holy cow. That tasted every bit as decadent as a standard cake! It was great. The woman taking our order was extremely patient and helpful, being that it was our first time as well. She suggested her favorites and led us through the menu.  The \"happy\" side of the menu has more not-so-healthy food that maybe I'll try in the future, but for now I'll stick to the skinny food that is still tasty!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to have a fun delicious meal! A hippie joint with a modern feel.  It can get crowded and the wait can be long. The place is small and it can get challenging to get a table even after you place your order. But the food is great and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Consistent!!!  Been to other locations. Great add on to downtown Summerlin. I still need to make sundae sundays.  Love the sugar cane soda."}
{"text":"We really loved the food. This place is the best of both worlds. You can eat healthy or not. We all ordered from the Happy side. I had the Cherry Popper which was bursting with flavor. My wife tried the Filet o Fire which she like but was expecting something else. My sister tried the Buff Chix and she said they were fire. And my bro tried the Meltdown and he loved it.  The only thing that we didn't like is that the dining area is really small so we couldn't find a table for 4. And we had to wait outside because a crowd came.  The service staff was very friendly and inviting. We will definitely being going again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"You know when you find a place that you can't say enough good things about?  SkinnyFATS in downtown summerlin is exactly one of those places. From the moment you walk in the staff is friendly and ready to help you fulfill your dining needs.  Which they gloriously do. I had been hesitant at first to go when they first opened because I am a creature of habit.   Yet after trying their delicious food once, it was an Ahi teriyaki sandwich and sweet potato fries, I was hooked.   Chicken, beef, fish, vegetables, they truly had it all. I had meant to write them a review for quite some time because, well, it's truly an amazing environment.   They have both a healthy and happy side - mind you the healthy side doesn't lack in the taste department.  Steakation and the ahi teriyaki are my go to sandwiches from the healthy side - both phenomenal - highly recommend and then there are also bowls with delicious jasmine rice.  The happy side--- it just opens a world of possibilities you would have have fathomed.  Beverage side - they also have pressed juices and a myriad of unique pop flavors that I have not seen elsewhere.   For example, how do you make a cheese steak better?   Add a whole bunch of amazing cheese! Like a French dip with cheese, the sweet cheesus is amazing.   In the mood for a burger? Try that cherry popper, it's got a nice kick with the jalapeños and the combination with the beef/bun/slaw is what dreams are made of.  Don't want rice bowls with chicken, fish, a burger, or a sandwich at all?  Never fear they serve breakfast all day. Their healthy wrap supastar is quite delicious with the Cajun cilantro and egg white burrito, but for a truly magnificent experience, the smotherload is on a whole new level.  You want to know what goes in a great breakfast burrito? Of course you were thinking filet mignon, right?   Cause that's in there.  This is a top notch breakfast burrito and one of the most delicious ones I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy.  You'll probably need a fork though because none of these foods will leave you with inadequate portions.  As you can see, I can't stop saying enough positive things about this location. I recommend it to everyone I can and highly advise you go in and be greeted by the wonderful ladies in the front yourself.  You won't be disappointed I assure you."}
{"text":"First time at SkinnyFATS, I ordered the Classic Burger cooked medium rare with truffle fries. Everything was cooked as ordered and I love the pineapple ketchup. Priced for the burger is under $11."}
{"text":"Avocado toast wasn't worth the price, the smoothie was meh. Honestly wasn't worth the hype."}
{"text":"Out of this world!!!!! The ambiance is on point, the food selection is marvelous! That drink station, cane soda, er my gerrrrrd!!!! I will definitely be coming back here! Those truffle fries and poke are to die for! I wish they would open up on the east side of town, that's my only request! If you haven't tried this place you need to, now!!"}
{"text":"Good value for the cost, not sure why others have said they feel shorted on portion size- maybe those people should head to Claim Jumper? Had the Steakation, tasty. My friend had the Cheesey peasey, she enjoyed it. Had the sweet potato fries instead of truffle as recommended by multiple reviewers, pretty good. Cashier seemed a little lost but she was friendly. I don't drink much soda but had to have the Cream Soda, it hit the spot. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Interesting concept and excellent food.  Only complaint is I felt a bit rushed trying to figure out how the menu worked. Place was packed at 1:30 and looks like they need to expand.  Had the burger Benedict with slaw which was very filling.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! I love having the choice between going healthy and going fatty! The buffalo chix are delicious and are reasonably priced. The juices are perfect for an after work out boost. I live right near this location so I go as much as I can. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is a great place to grab a healthy bite after a workout. There's a \"healthy\" side of the menu and a \"happy\" side for people who aren't trying to watch what they eat. There's basically something for everyone and that's what I love about the SkinnyFATS concept. I mean... How many times have you been on a diet but the friend you want to go out to eat with doesn't want to eat healthy or vice versa? It's a struggle trying to pick a place that you both can enjoy. And that's why SkinnyFATS is great!  The ambiance is fun and casual with colorful art painted onto the walls. It is always crowded, at least when I've been there. This isn't really a sit down and eat and have them wait on you sort of place because of the constant flow of traffic and limited seating at this location (haven't been to their other one yet) but in spite of those things, I still give this place 5 stars and recommend checking it out. My favorite thing on the menu so far is Smoke In A Bowl. Very yummy yet guilt-free."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice casual vibe and reminds me of a nice coffee shop that would be in Oregon or Washington. I ordered the cinnutella and it was sooo good!! I loved it. I would definitely order it again and I would definitely go back to try some of the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food. Went for the healthy stuff and it was hands down the best I've had in Vegas.  Seared ahi Sammy =winner. Yummus Hummus was very good. The online ordering was what sold me.  Going to be one of my Vegas regular stops!"}
{"text":"I'm like the last person in Vegas to have tried Skinny Fats it's been open a few years now, even branched out & open two more locations. None near me or ever in passing. So finally after all the good reviews I hear about the place I finally have my chance to try it.  I ordered the  -Buffalo Cauliflower  Bomb AF!   -Naked Chicks  First couple bites were phenomenal! Then I realized mixed right into the rice, there was a long straight hair. I had to trash the entire dish. Not to mention Im pretty sure I walked passed the chef smoking a cigarette by his car I'm guessing it was him cause of the SkinnyFats chef apron & long ponytail.   Other than that the service was phenomenal & it wasn't among wait. The hair being in the food really grossed me out & ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Got a delicious beet juice drink and from the healthy menu protein pineapple pancakes with a side of fruit. So delicious! Fun place very popular and busy"}
{"text":"I had the 'Juan Turkey Wrap' and was sadly very disappointed in it. I am usually not one for healthy food but thought i would give this place a try.  It was just tasted like mush in my mouth and was no flavorful at all. You could not discern and of the different ingredients and just didnt taste very good. Ended up just dousing it in hot sauce.  I am going to try and give this place another try and perhaps try ordering from the 'happy' side of the menu"}
{"text":"From the second you walk in, the overall atmosphere hits you that this isn't just any ordinary \"restaurant\". You will be immediately greeted by people who are passionate about their job and it truest shines through. I asked some help from Tony, the front cashier for some recommendations. He was excited that it was my fiancé and my first time and went through the menu with us explaining throughout and highlighting his personal favorites. He even told us some information about what the owner likes to eat. We purchased all that Tony recommended and were not disappointed!! Everything was prepared and cooked perfectly. Warning: once eating skinny fats fries you will no longer be happy with anywhere else's (but it's worth it). The shift lead at the store introduced herself and make sure we were taken care of. This restaurant is more than refreshing, and delectable. The staff at Skinnyfats will give you an experience like no other! We will definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"I went in with no expectations. I liked the chicken and waffles and appreciated that you could have either healthy or a more sinful dinner. Food choices are good. I like the choices or natural sugar soda.  I tried all the various choices and they were all good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! As the name implies, they have both healthy food and unhealthy food, as divided on their menu. The staff are over the top friendly and cool. During the weekends, it gets really busy so you may have to wait a while, since the place does not seat that many people. I want to try everything on their menu! Awesome."}
{"text":"Delicious eats! This location is a rather small one with limited seating. Even at off-peak times, it's pretty crowded. But the food it so worth it. On my most recent visit here, I had the buffalo chicken salad. It was delicious! Just the right amount of heat and lots of great flavors. I have yet to eat anything from here that isn't totally yummy. This location is in a bit of a strange spot, but it's so worth going here."}
{"text":"Do you like good food? Then you should eat here. It's really that simple. There's a healthy side of the menu. And there's a I don't really care side of the menu.  It's a small-ish place. You walk in, grab a menu (or use the menu over the counter), select what you want, order at the counter, received a number, and proceed to find a table. There's an indoor area as well as an outdoor area. The line to order can often be out the door. Next to the register, there is a screen that displays the various specials of the day. Be sure to check out the specials!  The prices are alright. It doesn't seem bad in relation to the quality and quantity you get.  For drinks, they do serve beer. They also have a variety of smoothies and juices, as well as natural sugar sodas. The black cherry soda is delicious!  Beware that there may be significant lag time between dishes arriving at your table. We had one arrive long before the rest. Like really long. The other dishes arrived separately too, but the time in between wasn't bad.  We tried a variety of food - chicken and waffles, red velvet waffle, buffalo chicken tenders with truffle fries, and their take on a Philly cheesesteak with sweet potato fries. The Philly cheesesteak was my favorite. It's got cherry peppers and banana peppers on it! And it has pepper jack cheese and cheese sauce. Yum, yum, yum! Even the roll is was on was delicious. I devoured the entire thing. The sweet potato fries were alright, but not nearly as good as the truffle fries.  In sum, we will be back. It is worth the drive from SE."}
{"text":"I love this place. Customer service is outstanding. Food is amazing. They use high quality ingredients. It does not disappoint. Plus I love their cups. They have amazing tea plus cane sugar soda which is awesome ."}
{"text":"I'm loving this place. I don't like fast food except for Raising Cane's. This is better than anything I've had of late. Employees are kind and fast and friendly. So much to try at this restaurant. I will be back."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times already. I think one of the best burger/omelette local place in Las Vegas. Not a best place for parking, might need to park at CVS and walk.   Food: Good Price: Good Service: Good Parking: Avg."}
{"text":"Holy delicious food and service. What a great business. Had the steak flatbread that was to die for, I love the to go cups and the decorations- would recommend this place to anyone. My friend got chx and waffles and another got a delicious flatbread. A++"}
{"text":"This place NEEDS another person taking orders at the front counter. The lines are ridiculously long at times and that would really be a good addition. The chicken tenders and truffle fries were delicious. However, the tomato soup was underwhelming. It tasted EXACTLY like marinara pasta sauce and was way too thick to be considered soup. I probably won't come running back to SkinnyFats a second time, but it's really not that bad of a place."}
{"text":"This place was really cool, menu had both a healthy side and non-healthy side.  Both sides of the menu looked really good.  They have similar healthy and non healthy items on the menu.  The line moves pretty quick and it can be a little overwhelming not knowing what to order. I highly suggest the healthy version tacos or non healthy.  The tacos were my favorite.  A non healthy item that is also popular and delicious was the steak and eggs.  The biscuit was so soft and fluffy.  Can't go wrong with either side of the menu."}
{"text":"This spot is popular.  Be sure to scope out your table first as space is very limited.  To eat, I had: Cinnutella Cinnamon & sugar Hawaiian bread french toast w/mixed berries, Nutella® chili sauce & orange syrup  To drink, I had:  Ginger Cinnaps Juiced apple, ginger & cinnamon mixed with 2% milk   Chicka wafa dopolis Fried chicken tenders over a buttermilk waffle w/syrup & powdered sugar"}
{"text":"Oh my god the Tunut salad was amazing the chicken on broad way was way big and so good and the burger was bomb!"}
{"text":"I truly received the best customer service of my life here at this location. Not only is the food always incredible and they have the most unique menu of any restaurant I've ever been to. But service is great. You can tell it's a privately owned restaurant and not some huge chain where the staff is hit or miss. They take pride in there service and food. I actually had a few mishaps with my food and the manager {Alana} went above and beyond to correct the issue. Way more than expected. I don't want to give specifics but she seriously amazed me. Alana is  an incredible manager. Thank you for the great service and you made a very loyal customer very happy and appreciated!"}
{"text":"We tried the classic burger and popper. And the bowl spicy   They had 4 different flavors of ketchup. A nice touch   It seems expensive but it's a fairly decent portion. It filled us up. The squats chairs are cool looking but their heavy to move."}
{"text":"I have been way past due to try out skinnyfats. They have a great menu with lots of health conscious options which I love. I feel like Vegas doesn't have enough places that focus on fresh, unique, and healthy meals. This place gives you a California vibe because of that. I was taking a look around and their presentations are beautiful! It makes the plate so much more appealing and gets you eager to eat lol. I got the berry the steak which was so delicious! It sounded like a strange pairing to do the shaved steak with blackberries but surprisingly, it went together really well. My boyfriend got a burger with truffle fries. His burger looked and smelled yummy, but the truffle fries were cold and soggy. Other than that, I am satisfied with my visit and excited to try something else from their extensive, unique menu."}
{"text":"Super friendly and welcoming staff. Loving the concept with the heathy and not-so-healthy menus. I ordered the wrap superstar and what a monster that thing was! Chock full of protein and healthy fats, it left me super satiated and full for hours. I will definitely be returning on my visit back to Las Vegas and just may drop in before my flight back to Hong Kong. 5 Stars SkinnyFats team!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. We walked from the New York New York Casino after seeing this hidden spot for something healthy and different! I'm so glad we did! My husband had the burger and truffle fries and I had the Chickhumm burger with a side salad. Service was exceptional and food was one of our best meals here in Vegas! I highly recommend trying it! Will be back next year for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Awesome staff & most importantly the food is delicious! The only down side to this restaurant is that they need a bigger space. It gets so packed that their is no where to sit."}
{"text":"Man I just love this place! I love that they offer a healthy side and happy side of the menu so I can have a choice. The service is always great, smiling faces and positive attitudes. Very hip looking staff and nice atmosphere. And the food is amazing!! And I'm not just saying for healthy food, all around it has great quality food. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat healthy in Vegas. The waffle I had is great. I would most likely go back. The drinks here are so fresh and great"}
{"text":"Found this place right outside of the Vegas strip. Was so excited to see somewhere that wasn't incredibly unhealthy and overpriced. The location is a bit hard to find as it's right off a highway road and no clear signs for it besides a billboard that pops up suddenly.   Loved the ambience and everything about the place. There are so many good eats on the menu - perfect place for brunch. Menu items are split between \"healthy\" (under 600 calories) and \"happy\" (over 600 calories). We ordered The GOAT (filet mignon, goat cheese, strawberries, infused pear, spinach), Applebottom Toast (cinnamon apples & strawberries over egg white multigrain French toast with soy cinnamon reduction & apple syrup), S'Motherload (filet mignon, egg, sausage, potatoes, peppers, onions, & pico in a tortilla with Cajun sauce), and The Green Mile (apple, kale, spinach, cucumber, celery). Total came to about $43.   The Goat salad and The Green Mile balanced out the \"happy\" items out well. My favorite was absolutely the Applebottom Toast, but honestly you can't go wrong with any of the menu selections. Definitely somewhere I'd visit again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to the other location only once, & the food and service was good. I didn't go back only because it was not on the side of town I live on. Once I found out it opened here I was excited to try it again. I ordered the Hot mess truffle fries,& the shrimp tacodilla. Both were really good. I would recommend them."}
{"text":"Refreshing! If you're looking for a meal that won't weigh you down this is the place. Their menu has a healthy side and a happy side. I love the Ahi taco san. And the naked chix. So good and so filling."}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp because the breakfast options at Excalibur hotel aren't great. It's a cool hip looking place on the inside. The coffee was good and the price was right. My wife had the chicken waffles and my daughter had pancakes or waffles I don't remember. They both liked their food. I didn't see any vegan options so I ordered the zucchini pasta dish and it was great (not sure other people would enjoy it for breakfast but I did). It would be nice to see some vegan options for breakfast...something like a tofu scramble breakfast burrito and also make a vegan option for the avocado toast."}
{"text":"Skinny Fats has one of the BEST veggie sandwiches I have ever had. I was lucky to be able to have lunch with fellow yelpers Jessie and Allison one weekday afternoon. This location is teeny tiny, but luckily Allison was a sweetheart and got there early to reserve us a table. So glad she did because this place has about 10 tables total, and they were all full. There was a line almost out the door, too.   I had browsed the menu before hand, so I knew I wanted the Vegwich, which is described as portobello, avocado, cherry/banana peppers, spinach, tomato & horseradish yogurt on 9 grain toast w/side. I opted for sweet potato fries as my side and got the yogurt on the side as well. I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie to go, as part of Yelp Shares the Love promotion that is going on.   The sandwich was so good and so were the sweet potato fries. I didn't care for the horseradish yogurt and am glad I got it on the side. The sandwich was so flavorful it didn't even need a sauce. My dining partners both got the Slow Boat to China, which looked amazing, and one of them got the hummus plate which looked good as well. I will have to try both those items next time.  I just wish this place was larger. I am sure they have heard this a million times by now, and hopefully they will expand not just to another location, but something A LOT bigger. And yes, I am aware of the location on Warm Springs and while it is bigger, it is still pretty small. If Allison hadn't been there to get us a table, we wouldn't have had anywhere to sit and eat. I shouldn't have to worry about wether or not I will have somewhere to sit to eat my lunch. Regardless of that, I will come back, especially since it is only 8 minutes from my work. :)  Yelp 2015 Review #32"}
{"text":"I've only been here once so this is a review based off of only one dish.  You walk in and you are warmly greeted by the cashier, who is extremely friendly! The decor is nice, they have a communal table and outdoor seating as well. Since this was my first time, I stepped off to the side and reviewed the menu for about 10 minutes until I finally settled on what I wanted to eat. I went with the Happy Mess which are truffle fries with shaved NY strip steak, bleu cheese, and pico de gallo. Drinks are self-served and they have a variety of different fountain drinks, some that I had never even heard off. I was impressed with that.   After ordering, I received my food after about 10 minutes. The fries looked good, and tasted somewhat good. They were too bland for my liking and not very filling. After finishing my fries I still felt hungry so I drove over to Ohana across the street for my second dinner. Maybe I should have ordered something else, maybe I eat a bit too much, but I left unsatisfied, they do have great service though. I'll try eating here again in the near future since they're only down the street from me."}
{"text":"I get upset when I order something super bad for me and it isn't good. Like when I ordered the \"Sweet Cheesus\" sandwich at SkinnyFATS, which could also be called \"Bad Philly Cheesesteak\"-- I was expecting it to be awesome. Griddled beef and onions on a toasty roll smothered with cheese? How could that NOT be awesome? Well, somehow the masterminds at SkinnyFATS made it not awesome and then they did it again with the salad and my husband's sandwich and my friend's sandwich and my other friend's sandwich. Not sure why all the positive reviews. And while I'm being honest here, WTF IS UP WITH THE MENU?!? The menu item names are not clever, confusing AF and made it extraordinarily difficult to peruse as a hungover person trying to get TF outta Vegas. The \"Turnip Taco\" has not a trace of turnip, but rather filet mignon. \"TOMato Cruise\" is the name of the tomato soup? Why? Please TELL ME WHY because I've literally been thinking about it since I ate there like 3 months ago. Would you like to order the \"Chickhumm\"? No, me neither because that sounds like a drunk person's idea of a name for a chicken and hummus sandwich. And it also sounds disgusting.   The oatmeal cookie was good though."}
{"text":"My wife and I have just finished a visit to Las Vegas, and we came here twice in a weekend!  We first came for dinner, and our food was delicious!  We came back and got breakfast this second time, and we were blown away by how good it was.  We had the #Merica, and two items from the secret menu - One Eyed Monster and Cinnutella.  Our food was to die for, especially the Cinnutella!!  That was hands-down the best breakfast I've eaten!    Not only is the food good, but the staff is extremely friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. They took such good care of us, and they showed a passion and pride in everything they serve.  We've been to several restaurants over the weekend, and we have not been treated half as well as we have here at SkinnyFATS.    This place is a must-visit for locals and tourists alike!!!"}
{"text":"If you want to eat healthy, this is the place for you.  Really good food. I have a friend who insists on eating here a couple times a week"}
{"text":"Everything was 5 stars. Service was awesome and they did a great job of helping us pick out what to get. We decided on the Slow Boat to China, Nakedchix, and the Wake n bacon. All three of the dishes were very flavorful and delicious. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"UPDATE 2/3/17: In the interest of full disclosure, we were comp'd $40 towards this meal after our previous 2 less than stellar experiences.  I'm super happy to report that we tremendously enjoyed most of our food tonight, all from the Happy Side and all with tasty animals featured.  As a lady in line behind us remarked to other patrons, \"I only ever order from the Happy Side because you can't go wrong!\"  I couldn't agree more!  Hubby had the Cherry Popper with sweet potato fries and I had the Sweet Cheese Us with sweet potato fries.  We also had the Tu-Nuts to share.  First of all, if nothing else, I would come back every day just for those fries.  They are literally perfection and tonight was somehow even more crack-iliciously good than normal!  The Cherry Popper was absolutely scrumptious, at least from the tiny piece I was able to finagle off of Hubby.   I'm actually sad that I didn't go with my original intention of ordering this myself.  The Tu-Nuts was also divine!  Beware, this is sinfully rich, but oh so worth it!  Hubby would've liked to have a little more heat to balance all the sweet richness, but I thought it was great as is.  Interestingly, this may be the only dish on the entire menu that lists spicy ingredients but is actually LESS spicy than expected!  Our only slight disappointment, bringing this down to 4 stars from an otherwise perfect 5 stars, was the Sweet Cheese Us, specifically the very thin and grainy cheddar sauce.  The meat itself was tender and juicy, if a tad under seasoned, but the sauce left a very odd texture and taste in our mouths.  If I ordered this again, I would skip the sauce and just keep the pepper jack cheese it also comes with.  I was also happy to see that the names of some new items had been changed since our last visit to avoid any future confusion with same-name items at their other locations.  Great job, SkinnyFATS, on both service recovery and living up to your delicious reputation this time!"}
{"text":"I have only tried this place twice. That is my biggest regret because I live so close. They are consistently friendly, fast and delicious. Even on my worse days, when I only eat because I have to, their food reminds me of the joy and pleasure of simple pleasures. I'm going to eat my way through their menu as therapy :-)"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place out for a long time. I was finally hungry and around downtown summerlin and decided to see what this place was all about. The decor is very hipster and very earth friendly with a modern twist. You order like a fast food place but you go and sit down and they bring you the food in nice ceramic plates. They have complimentary water w/ lime and lemon by the sauce bar. They don't have the average fountain drinks but its soda with real cane sugar. The menu has lots of vegetarian options. They also have everything categorized by healthy & happy aka fattening. They have a small outdoor patio area with gas warmers too. I ordered the Sweet Cheese Us, it's like a Philly Cheese steak belive me it was really GRATE haha no pun intended. Mainly because this had the perfect amount melty cheese. Yum! My hubby got the Shrimp Tacodillas. I had a bite and they were pretty good. The quality of the Shrimp was very good and it was a small size taco. My bff got the Hot Chic salad. They didn't skimp out on the avocado which is great. It tasted like boneless hot wings mixed with a salad.  Over all to me it was pretty pricey, we got 2 entrees,1 drink and 1 cookie and we paid around $32ish. The quality of the food is great but portions are small so I wouldn't expect to get full."}
{"text":"Wow! There is no words to explain this place. I just love every little thing about it! Their food is delicious for example, their Filet O Fire was amazing, Sunday Sunday, and the Melt Down! These are my favorite and also if you go in the morning they have pancakes which I believe serve the whole day. Your crazy if you skip this place you really need to come eat here!"}
{"text":"Very good burger, unique drinks. Warn atmosphere. The serving staff could use some training and better awareness of the menu. But pretty good all together."}
{"text":"Good, not great, and wayyy too expensive. I met some friends here for lunch on Saturday, and it was busy. The line to order was long, so it gave me some time to look over the menu. I decided on the tu nuts, truffle fries, and a drink. My total was $16!! I like that you get to keep the cups, and if you bring them back on your next visit you get $0.50 off your next drink.  Inside seating was full, but luckily the weather was gorgeous so we sat outside. The food came out quickly, considering how busy they were. The tu nuts was good, but it was not filling. The fries were just okay. Not really truffle-ly.  I tried the sweet potato fries and they were good, I will get them next time. Honestly I was still hungry after eating. Next time I would probably order a sandwich or something more filling.  Yelp 2015 Review #30"}
{"text":"This review is long over due! This is my go to spot for a good meal, and amazing vibes from the SkinnyFats crew. I absolutely love Fonzi. She was at another SkinnyFats location, and I thank the heavens she is my neck of the woods now! I absolutely love her smile, and always on point recommendations. That's actually the reason I kept coming back in the first place. I remember saying if you try and like that, come back for this! I've been coming for awhile now and have my go to's but I never mind a Fonzi suggestion. :)  My go to's if you're wondering... (I like spicy/hot food) - Buffchix: freaking awesome buffalo like chicken tenders with truffle fries.  - A blazin hot chicken sandwich which is just out of this world. It is has a nice kick to it. I think it's hotter than most of their menu items. You can chose your side- I'm biased and love the fries.  - Smootherload: amazingggg breakfast burrito loaded with the staples and topped with a cheese sauce of some sort! Ummm delicious.  - Chickenwaffledoplias: I just butchered the spelling of it... but basically great chicken and waffles. Now I have never had real chicken and waffles but they know how to make a damn good fried chicken and a fluffy waffle so I'm happy! I'm kinda of a weirdo and I'm obsessed with the buffchix buffalo sauce so I ask for some on the side for my chicken and waffles that already comes with syrup. Weird... but try it!"}
{"text":"When Skinny Fats first opened, I went within the first month of opening, and it was fantastic. That was the Dean Martin location. I was so excited to go back but so out of the way to go.  Now this location popped up a couple years back, I've gone about 5-6 times last year, and I'm just addicted to the service and food. Initially the price scared me, but so much freaking food for the price and most important...quality!  My favorite item on the menu is the Filet O Fire. I got this bad boy about a week ago, and my partner wanted to steal it. He had cinnutella, and even those gorgeous and delicious, nothing compares to Filet O Fire.  Thanks for the great business, and my partner and I  can't wait to come back for the boozy brunch day- big OJ mimosa? Yes please!!!!"}
{"text":"Despite the odd location (which is worth every moment of \"Google Mapping\" to find)...Skinny Fats is Casual Culinary Perfection!!  ...and once you do locate the restaurant, you do grow fond of it's unique location.  The menu is adorable!  I order the Chickity China (a yum take on Chinese Chix Salad)...the truffle fries (with lovely Jalapeno ketchup, provided at the table) and a cookie -- always fresh and consistently yummy (ask for the cookie to be warmed in the oven...Heaven!).  It is always buzzing with eager and happy patrons and each dish that passes by looks more amazing than the last...next time I'll be sure to finally order those pretty waffles!!"}
{"text":"Been three times in my week here on business so far and it's one of my favorite places to go, but the customer service really needs to step it up!  On my first visit no one explained the menu sides and I got laughed at for asking if I \"really need two\" of the tacos, plus a side of fries and drink. On top of that, they forget my fries with my order! Granted the taco was tasty, I was peeved at the cashier for making a rude comment. A simple \" the tacos are kinda big, are you sure you'd like two?\" would have been nicer. (Hint for anyone order, order one plus a side and you'll be happy!)  The second and third time I came here wasn't by choice but because of group carpooling for business. Had the buffalo Chix (tasty and good portion size!) but fries were kinda soggy in the truffle oil. I asked for a second side of ranch for the chicken but it never came. Third time I got the healthy version of the ahi tuna taco (first time was the happy version).  And a cookie. This was also quite good, but I never got my cookie! When I asked one of the girls bringing out food about it, she took my receipt (I assume to go get it) and never returned. I went up to the cashier after I finished (about 5 min later) and she got my cookie for me finally but by then I was already annoyed that they can't get the little things right.   I'll try my luck at the other location if my group goes again but at this rate, food is winning over the crap customer service sadly. I really want to give this place 5 stars but they need to step it up in order to do that."}
{"text":"My favorite go to place for healthy/happy alternatives.   There is so much to explore on their menu it's outrageous!   All relatively comparable price I thoroughly enjoyed going to both locations and am so happy they are expanding to Henderson as well.  Their menu has something for everyone salads soups burgers rice.  Cultural splashes all over! It's fantastic"}
{"text":"I tried this place last week and I cannot wait to go back. The food, service and atmosphere were all awesome! I had the Berry on the Steak, it was so delicious and like nothing else I've ever had. The steak combined with spring mixed greens, goat cheese and black berries on top of a savory flatbread...need I say more. Every menu item that was brought to our table for my friends looked so delicious. Like I said before I cannot wait to go back..."}
{"text":"OMG! Gotta get the cluckmoo and the pimp shrimp ! So awesome ! Great service and a cool retro location !"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to SkinnyFATS with two friends when we were in Vegas. Our first visit we ordered the Meatzza and they gave us the Caprizza. That dish was a very unsatisfying experience. I contacted SkinnyFATS on Facebook and they responded to my post within minutes. They made us a very generous offer to make up for the mishap so that we could go to the restaurant and experience it again. The food that we ordered was FABULOUS. We got the Meatzza (made it gluten free with vegan cheese), Buff Chix with truffle fries (this was incredible), and Smoke in a Bowl with avocado (crazy good).   SkinnyFATS will definitely be one of our go-to places whenever we visit Vegas and we highly will highly recommend them to everyone."}
{"text":"Sooooo flippin good!!!! I am never disappointed when I eat here. Everyone is so friendly and the food is AMAZEBALLS."}
{"text":"They have... everything. From healthy to... Happy food, great choice, lots of specials, innovative and interesting combinations, and super friendly staff. The only thing is the dining room is too small and usually packed... very cool decor and design, urban-chic style, I love it!"}

{"text":"Skinny Fats is an awesome food spot. Varied menu with both Healthy and Happy menu items. Pretty much have anything on the menu that one would want. Food comes out fresh and piping hot. Their craft style sodas are a welcome addition. Highly recommend giving this place a try. You will not be disappointed. Friendly staff, great food and atmosphere in Downtown Summerlin. Order at the counter and your food is delivered to your table."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and great food. The restaurant was clean and pleasant. The place is a little small with a patio and has a lunch following. I suggest going early or having takeout if you are in a large group. The concept of indulgent or healthy food is really nice no one had a problem finding something yummy to eat."}
{"text":"My family was ending a trip to Vegas and wanted a place to eat breakfast before a long road trip. They all wanted different types of food but I suggested this breakfast place that had great reviews. We came at around 10:30 where all the seats were already taken (first come first serve seating, limited) but no line. No longer than 5 minutes later there were people starting to line up. I was greeted with a smile and I felt bad for piling on a complicated order while there were tons of people behind me but she reassured me that it was okay and didn't seem to be phased by the order. We received our food and it was beyond spectacular. Everyone in my family was more than pleased with what they had. I ordered the Wake n' Bacon with cheddar cheese instead of pepper jack. I kid you not it got better with each bite, not like other foods that deprecate after some time. The avocado and sriracha cream cheese were great compliments to the sandwich. We were visited by workers every 10 minutes to make sure we were fine. The ambiance was great and the only negative was how crowded it was from everyone coming which lead to limited seating. I could come here 5 more times and try something new every time! This is a MUST GO when on or around the strip!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, but frankly not as good as the hype.  Might be the best in the neighborhood but really could be better."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS. Where do I begin with you?  First off, thank you for always fulfilling my inner fat kid. I almost always order from the happy menu (the more unhealthy menu). And I have no ragrets. Not even a single letter.  But on a more serious note. The food here is always on point. Depending on what time of day you come in, this place is usually packed and busy. The outside seating is nice during spring and summer.  I would suggest ordering any kind of burger on their happy menu. Medium rare. And throw in an extra fried egg if the burger doesn't already have it. You're welcome.  Also. They serve alcohol! Try out one of their cocktails. They're usually a fusion of something incredibly healthy, if that's what you're looking for. But the drinks taste pretty good.  The wait here may take a little longer than expected but that's because the food is made fresh and there's usually a ton of people here. Which is definitely good for business.  The staff are always kind and you are greeted right away upon entering and leaving.   SkinnyFATS is dangerously located about 5 mins away from me and it gives me even more reason to frequent this place with my hanger (not hunger)."}
{"text":"3.7 stars.   I like the concept here but the employees def need some training on what's in their food.  I asked what was in the citrus dressing to the cashier and he said, \"idk, citrus?\".  Okay obviously there's citrus in the citrus dressing. So he asked another employee next to him what's in the citrus dressing. She goes, \"ya know, it has a citrus taste with citrus in it.\"  Wow after that I couldn't help but to burst out laughing.   She's like \"what? Is that not good enough for you?\"   I mean, no it's not good enough. That doesn't give me enough info on your dressing. After that, it just got awkward.   Anyways,  The menu is pretty big with lots of options. I ordered the ahi tuna sandwich and it was pretty good. It def did not feel skinny since it had butter on the bread and it being drenched with teriyaki sauce. The balsamic vinaigrette tasted like the one from trader joes.   The French fries were good and especially with their jalapeño ketchup!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Staff is really really great...you can tell they enjoy their work and take pride in this little gem of a restaurant! First time here can be daunting as the menue has very creative names for everything.   Take you time and read through all the options! Guaranteed to become one of you fav spots. Locals, kid frendly, great food, great people...  Only"}
{"text":"super friendly employees, awesome jams playing, wonderful atmosphere. and the food..... amazing. husband got something from the \"happy\" menu, and I ordered from the \"healthy\" menu. everything was so fresh and super tasty. worth the pricy menu. hummus was fresh, but lacked some flavor. but this will be a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"The teriyaki ahi tuna is my favorite dish. the modern hipster feel is definitely  the vibe this place gives off. So if you're into that, you'll fit right in. The service is great, they normally greet you through the door. Nice place to eat. Prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast with 2 friends & really enjoyed this place. The food selection on both healthy & happy sides sounded great & it was hard to choose! I opted for the protein pancakes and they were tasty! I especially enjoyed the frsh juice I had. Don't remember the name but it had beets! Anyhow, it's a little off the beaten path, but super cute inside and good service. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"#SkinnyFats #LasVegas 'The Cheeseburger Benedict': Yo! When you walk in, make sure you get ya'self the strawberry lemonade b. Make sure you do that. This was my first time here so the shorty with the nose ring over the counter recommended the burger with the egg. I added truffle fries for the ride along. You know Batman sometimes needs Robin but at the same time, he still the main dude ya'nahmean? The truffle fries are Robin. They good but they're not the main event, you understand? Anyway, they gave me the burger on a big ass tin plate that look like a sewer cap b. You know the ones the ninja turtles come out of? I saw mad yolk pourin' from the egg b, that shit look like watered down mustard when you first squeeze the bottle on your hotdog b and you get the bun kind of soggy. That's what that shit looked like b. I had to ask the dude for a steak knife so I can cut this big ass mondo burger in half, nahmean? I finally got my truffle fries after I split my burger that's why it's not in the picture. But when the fries came... I was like shit! How many potatoes y'all kill for that shit? But like I said they not the main event so I ain't pay em' no mind. I took a bite out the burger and surprisingly it wasn't soggy, that shit blew my mind, the burger stayed togetha but mad yolk got on my hands b. I used like 60 napkins but they keep a box right next to you, nahmean? It's like they knew I was gon get the egg b, like they saw me come in and was like \"look at this cat, he bout to get the egg.\" Moving forward, you know I finished my burger, ate all my truffle fries, got my lemonade refill b and overall I was satisfied with the meal. But I can't give it the ultimate cheeseburger stamp because you know frankly it was pretty good but who ain't thought to put an egg in their burger before, nahmean? The name was clever but not as clever as the cheeseburger itself you know what I'm sayin'? Like son, the truffle fries was almost better than the main event. I would probably get this again tho if I was on a date and I wanted the shorty to be uninterested in me. It's a good date ender, you gotta eat kind of messy, be mad rude and shit nahmean? If you never, wanna see that broad again yo, order this. Overall I'll give this cheeseburger a 5 out of 7 rating. #MoochEats"}
{"text":"This place is super trendy and I like the concept but the whole system is kinda weird because it leaves you guessing, like do you get sat at a table? or get in line?does someone brings the food? But it all sorta works out on its own you just get in line to order, then you can sit wherever you want just make sure to get a number stick that you can put on the table so when your food is ready it can be brought out to you, and also they pick up after your food when your done. There menu is definitely different you really have to look at the ingredients to see if you will like it, I got bux chic I think that's what it's called but it was basically chicken tenders covered in buffalo sauce with a side of truffle fries and ranch and so far that has been my favorite thing that I've gotten from here, I've been here before but I've always thought there food was okay in the taste department. But I do still like to come to try different things out, I still recommend a try especially if your looking for healthier options and it's reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service!!!! This place a so GOOD! You need to eat here if you are in Vegas! Trust me!!!! Trust me!!! So GOOD!!! The best!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this place a couple of times now.  Against my better judgment, I definitely went with the \"skinny\" side of the menu. Next time I go, I am definitely going to go with the \"other\" (I forget what they actually call it) side of the menu.   I try to be more of a clean eats type so this definitely fits my needs.   I remember finding the soup particularly tasty. And then, I did what felt right and went with the chocolate chip cookie for dessert. Very tasty with large chocolate chunks. Highly recommend.   They have a really interesting menu so I will definitely be back to try a few more things."}
{"text":"Love this place! This is my second time here and I had to force myself to try something new as I loved my shrimp tacos last time! This time I tried smoke in a bowl and subbed cauliflower rice for low carb and it was amazing!!!!  The employees actually act like they like working here and want to make sure you enjoy your visit! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very healthy food. Creative choices.  Ate the zucchini noodles with Chicken.  Awesome. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Meh...  but there needs to be more so:  There was a place called skinny fat There was nowhere to sit at People hovered around  Better burgers can be found The fancy ketchup wasn't all that."}
{"text":"I am here at least once a week. The food is amazing 4/5 of the time and they staff the friendliest people!!! The restaurant is a bit small and they are always busy and there are times when we can't get a table right away...but the Ahi tacos are amazing and they have TRUFFLE FRIES! Serves great breakfast all day which is fantastic. It has a very hipster vibe so it totally fits me. And I like that they have daily/weekly specials that are so creative and flavorful. I enjoy trying something new when I go and when I do I don't regret it, but of course I come back for my favorites too!"}
{"text":"This place is SO good. I've gotten Tu Nuts, the club sandwich, ahi tacos, and the three egg scramble (but the whole egg instead of whites). Love a restaurant that will cater both to my healthy streaks and when I want to splurge! Also tried waffles with berries, they were very good. Haven't had anything bad yet!"}
{"text":"Good Food, Fun Concept, Healthy portions, good pricing.  Fun place to stop in for a quick bite or take out."}
{"text":"Fabulous. Very busy and popular place. Why? Because the staff is friendly and the food is SO DELICIOUS! Check online for their 'secret menu' though everything I have tried so far has been well worth the drive across town for it. Don't let the \"healthy side\" detour you, thinking only the \"happy side\" will be tasty (why people think healthy = bland, I don't know!) - The healthy menu is very good. Some of my favorites are on it."}
{"text":"We stopped by with my 4 year old for a late lunch on a weekday and it was RAMMED. Our food was pretty relish and my daughter had this citrus basil milkshake that sounds strange but was awesome. I just had to knock down a star for the ordering experience. Walking in there was a massive line to order at the counter and not very many tables available. Ordering was not fast...and trying to snag a table whilst waiting in an out the door line in a tiny restaurant was all sort of anxiety-inducing for me. Once we had a table and got our food, it was all way uphill from there. Next time I will do some meditating before I go. Even better- add delivery service, guys!"}
{"text":"This place is soo delicious! My fiancé and I were having a conversation about not being able to find a place that has healthy but delicious and inventive/creative food and than she stumbled upon an add in a local paper talking about this place! We couldn't find the location at first because neither of us were familiar with the area but after a turn around we got there :) and boy was it worth it! The aPOLLO fries are to die for! And the menu has so many amazing options. I highly recommend \"The Slow Boat to China\" and the \"TBLT.\" And if you don't want to eat healthy you can try they're \"happy\" menu which I didn't try but looks just as tasty. Seriously, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Always great customer service and delicious food! My favorite is smoke in a bowl. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Customer service is 4 Star. The line was getting long because there was a lady who couldn't make up her mine. The workers were patient and kind. For the rest of us in line, we were wondering why someone couldn't start going down the line to get our orders started.   The food is 3 Star. I appreciate the worker switching out my soggy fries for fresh ones. My burger looked sod compared to the pics the business posted on yelp. Overall, I wouldn't come back here when I come to Vegas. Even as a healthy option, the naked chix lacked taste. The cherry popper was okay.   They have a lot of interesting options. Personally, I did not enjoy this place. The inside was cramped and there wasn't enough seats. We asked two guys if we could sit next to them in the other two chairs."}
{"text":"I haven't been inside of SkinnyFats, but I had it delivered, and was pleasantly surprised! I initially thought the menu would only include uber-healthy, vegan type stuff, so imagine my surprise when I saw that not only did it have healthy offerings, but things to satisfy all of our inner fat boys and girls!  I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with bacon and cheese (I forget the official name of it) along with sweet potato fries. That sandwich was like heaven! The chicken was fresh, juicy, tender and flavorful. Not overly breaded, hot and  just delicious. The bun was amazing- soft and filling. And the fries were perfect as well. I sampled a spicy chicken and rice dish (it had pineapples and peppers) and that was great too! Really flavorful and again, very fresh tasting.  I will definitely be getting more from SkinnyFats! I'm a convert!"}
{"text":"Try the Merica and truffle fries!  This is a great little place serving fresh, inventive food at reasonable prices.  Bit tucked away, (I drove past it twice!) but well worth the effort!    Mandy was great!  The whole staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Food is good went here on last trip ordering process is only downside it's like tender greens a disaster at the front but again food is solid will go back despite slow inefficient ordering process."}
{"text":"If you happen to be a fat guy like me and are looking for some healthy food with great taste, look no further than SkinnyFATS. Been to this gem of a food joint a few times now and I must say this place does does not disappoint. Don't be afraid to try something out of your wheel house as if you do, you may miss out on some great food combinations. Well done SkinnyFATS."}
{"text":"The dining room was packed so I took it to go. The Cherry Popper and truffle fries were still delicious, and the service was friendly and quick. Can't wait to try everything else!"}
{"text":"Disappointed....my husband and I ordered a burrito from the happy and healthy side. Both were lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"This was mine and my mothers first visit. I got the mango chix bowl I think it's called and she got a steak blue cheese salad (forgot the name). My chicken bowl was delicious. I can't wait to try everything else on the menu because it all sounds great. It's a cute hipster vibe and you seat yourself. I can't wait to come here more! Also the prices seem reasonable because the food is almost restaurant style quality."}
{"text":"What I like about this place is they make it so easy to pick the healthy side of the menu because it tastes sooooo dang good. It does get crowded at lunch time and usually have to wait a while just to order, but it's worth it at the end. I've had breakfast and lunch here, and both are big winners!"}
{"text":"If you haven't made it to Skinny Fats what are you waiting for. If you are on your cheat meal of just wanting a good healthy meal this is the stop. I wish they would add a couple more location in Northern Vegas or Summerlin."}
{"text":"First meal in Vegas and was absolutely amazing.   I got two dishes: the buffalo tenders with the fries, and I got the burger with an egg with sweet potato fries.   The burger was the best part. The bread was some type of Hawaiian roll, or something, cause it made each bite that much better. The meat was cooked perfectly and the egg was a must. The sweet potato fries did not deny us any flavor.   The buffalo tenders were a good addition. However, the fries it came with wasn't very appealing. I still cleaned the entire plate, and by the end, I was very full and satisfied.   I had a cane soda, and it tasted a little different at first but unlimited refills helped me get use to the flavor. And a nice free water jug to the side kept me quenched throughout my meal.   I would definitely come back for the burger again. However, it was very filling. Maybe I'll try a healthier option next time, as their menu gives u a choice of healthy or amazing/greasy selections."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place from the other reviews. However, the service was lacking at this place. It might have been an off day though. It was a super busy lunch and there were loads of people standing waiting for a table (it's a tiny place, but they should be expanding soon). I had the portobello mushroom sandwich and they forgot my side salad.  But after having to walk up to the counter and explaining that we were missing a salad, we finally got it.  There was a couple who had been waiting over 30 min for their food and demanded a refund. The food tastes great and hopefully when they expand their execution will improve."}
{"text":"After hearing good things about this place I finally stopped in on a Saturday morning. It was pretty crowded inside from the breakfast rush and a lot smaller then I expected.   The employees were extremely helpful from the moment I walked in. After reading previous Yelp reviews I had an idea of what I wanted to order. I love the healthy options that they have but since it was my first time here I decided to order from the happy breakfast not healthy breakfast.  I ordered the REDiculous with a side of potatoes instead of bacon and my boyfriend ordered the S'motherload. Everything looked and tasted amazing!  I wanted to try one of their cold pressed juices and one of the employees suggested the liquid defense and to add ginger. I was not disappointed!  The juices were a little on the pricey side but other then that I'd probably order it again.   I definitely will be coming back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Super yummy!! Friendly staff. Kate recommended our new favorite smoothie, Golden Sour"}
{"text":"The food was good, the staff was friendly. We were just disappointed that there are only a couple of tables in there for sitting and eating. We ended up having to split up just to sit down and eat (there were only four of us). Probably won't go back unless we're getting it \"to go\", and in that case, I'd prefer a drive-thru.  Update: Was contacted by management regarding my review, they are working on trying to expand dining, and in the meantime, their other locations do have bigger dining areas! We'll head to those next time! Love management that cares about customer's opinions in this difficult market!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and got a burrito from the not so healthy side.  It was outstanding.  The only downside was the cheese sauce was a little broken, but it still tasted awesome.  Wife and I shared some \"frickles\" (fried pickles) and they were awesome.  Wife had a patty melt and was equally pleased.  One thing I dont like is they have a secret menu that I wish was posted on their website or something."}
{"text":"I am SOOOO excited that there is a SkinnyFATS on the west side of town!!! The new location is beautiful and spacious, and has a lovely patio/outdoor area as well.  Aside from a long-ish wait to place my order, and a long wait for food to be delivered, everything was great! It was a busy Sunday, so I totally understand the wait time. The food is delicious, and the staff very friendly. I only order from the Happy side of the menu, cause I am an inner fattie, but of course they have their healthy options as well. I didn't love the Benny of the day as much as I did some of the others, but it still was tasty. The Cherry Popper burger is amazing as always. Prices for entrees range from $10-$12 on average. I also love that the drink cups are reusable- I've got quite the collection of SkinnyFATS cups at home!  I will definitely be back- again and again!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and environment! The only bad thing i can really say is there aren't many options for a person who doesn't consume soda. But overall still a great experience."}
{"text":"I love this place i've already had 5 items from their menu and love everything. The healthy side is so good and has so much flavor as does the happy!"}
{"text":"This new location is just as great as the others!  Excellent service, amazing food... this one is a little bit bigger than the other locations and the perfect spot at Downtown Summerlin.  If you haven't been before, I highly recommend the Buff Chix with a side of spicy aioli.  Their menu seems to be ever expanding, as I didn't see a few of my old go to's on there (i.e. Slow Boat to China).  Next time I go, I'll try to order an oldie but goodie and report back!"}
{"text":"The food is really great!! I had the TBLT with a small salad from the skinny menu and my friend had the Cheeseburger Benedict from the happy menu. Such a great concept! Made eating healthy easier! Place is very small and seating is limited. Staff was friendly"}
{"text":"I was expecting healthier options.. It wasn't horrible just not healthy enough for me"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out. I follow them on Instagram and it was killing me always seeing these delicious photos. The place is super cute! Love the décor, love the vibe. Unfortunately, my \"skinny side\" bowl had absolutely no flavor. It was as bland as hospital food. I kid you not when I say I took two bites and threw it away. It was so bland and for almost $10, it was more white rice than anything. I could get over the portion and the price if the food \"wow-ed\" me but this was just sad. I read so many good reviews. I was just so disappointed. You shouldn't have to order the \"happy\" side to have flavor. If that's the case, they really should put a warning sign on the 'SKINNY' side."}
{"text":"Horrible food . I didn't enjoy it and the place was dirty the napkins box that was on the table was all covered in dust . The food was all over the floor from previous table they didn't clean it and I don't think they did even when I left ."}
{"text":"The reviews were all correct! This place is delicious. Worth the wait (if there is one) yum. You won't leave hungry. Definitely coming back. The lemon herb aioli they put on some of their sandwiches is so so good."}
{"text":"Just minutes from McCarran Airport, located at a strip mall, there's plenty of free parking. The food is good and very reasonably priced. Being from out of town, I knew the place was a good choice for a Monday morning breakfast when there were locals waiting outside for the restaurant to open."}
{"text":"The Skinny: decent burger for the price, the Steaknation not much as they skimp on the protein. Pass on the truffle fries(3) Service is counter service (3), Value: for $23.50 for two people for lunch given what we ordered? Meh - I've definitely had better (3)  I can't help to think that the concept of a healthy/happy side was pretty appealing for me. However when perusing the menu, from a nutrition stand point, the healthy side didn't seem so healthy to me with the exception of a smaller portion size.   After badgering the hubby to come with me, we settled on selecting what we would get. The hubs got the Steaknation ($11) off the healthy side while I settled for The Classic ($10) burger from the happy side. Coming with sides, the hubs ordered the sweet potato fries while I opted for the truffle fries.   Being curious of the Boyland cane soda fountain, we ordered a small soda which came in a pretty cute reusable cup. I heard rumors that you get a discount on your next purchased drink if you bring in the cup although there isn't anything on the website or in the store that agreed with this. Overall, the handcrafted soda fountain was kind of a miss for me. Yeah, it's made with real cane sugar but it is awfully sweet. They also featured Shangri-la brewed iced tea which tasted really watered down. The cucumber/lemon water is a nice touch though.  I thought the Classic burger itself was a solid burger. The burger was done to a perfect medium while the flavor of the SF sauce (basically a upscaled rendition of the 1000 Island Big Mac sauce) was delicious. However a few minor details kind of detracted from the experience. I didn't like the fact that they shredded the iceberg lettuce, taking away from the crispiness of the produce. The steak tomatoes were sliced too thin as well. Second minor quibble was the quality/size of the brioche bun relative to the burger patty. I thought that the bun lacked sufficient butter flavoring and was overly large for the meat. I would give this burger about a 3.5 stars overall.  The Steaknation was from the healthy side - which meant that they kind of skimped out on the meat inside the sandwich. What meat was in there was a bit dry although seasoned well. The horseradish yogurt was also a bit bland as well and rather unassuming. Definitely needed a bit more kick to it. I liked the arugula but the hubs felt it was a pass. Again, the tomatoes were too thinly sliced for my tastes.   The truffle fries were really disappointing. Soggy and without a hint of truffle oil, they were terrible. Would not recommend this option at all. The sweet potato fries fared better and I would have preferred this over the truffle fries any day of the week.  Overall, considering what they charge, I would consider this a 3 starred joint. For what you get on the happy side, it seems a bit overpriced if you think about the portion size. The burger is decent but it's not perfect either. The soda fountain options were a bust for me being too sweet and the iced tea being too watered down. Long story short, I think I'll pass on this joint. (3 starred review)."}
{"text":"Seating is a little bit of a mess. People are pretty cut-throat about finding a spot. Noticing this, we got permission from a kind man to put our number token down on his table as he and his family finished up their food. I was a little bit outraged when someone who'd ordered after us tried to sit down at that table immediately after the family left.  Food is alright. My boyfriend enjoyed his Chicka Wafa Dopolis, my mom and brother each got the Wake N Bacon, and I picked out the Cluck Moo. I wish I'd looked for actual photos first, since I would've picked something else. It was good but I preferred the Wake N Bacon's flavor profile. Cluck Moo is very standard breakfast fare, nothing terribly unique about it.  We also shared the Balls 2.0 - which I didn't realize were literally the number of risotto balls... They were quite tasty though! I'd get that one again for sure.  Good food? Yes. Would I brave the masses trying to fight for a table again? Don't think so."}
{"text":"Stopped by SkinnyFats for post work feeding.  Decided to stop by because everyone was raving about this place. I had to check it out. Beforehand, I checked out the menu to see what I can devour on. I was sold on the ahi tacos. Yup that's it. Oh yeah, fries too. But fries is like a staple food. Comes and goes with EVERYTHING!  Anyway, back to the ahi tacos. Ordered two cause I was hungry and greedy. Took a bite out of it, it wasn't all that. It was alright. It had coleslaw like salsa and of course ahi.  For my fries, I asked if they could put feta cheese on it. I tried to make it Greek-y.  Would come back though...for something else. Like a pizza."}
{"text":"I would like to start off by saying that this place is delicious. I enjoyed my burgers and the unique pickles we ordered. At first our experience wasn't the best as the order didn't all come out at the same time. I will give credit to Fonz, the manager for stepping in and making things better. Her customer service and attitude made this a much more pleasant."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location it seems like you guys are understaffed especially today but your employee Zia always seems to keep things in order, she greets everyone that comes thru the door and checks on customers who are waiting for their order which is why I'm rating you guys 5 stars but I think you need to stop over working your employees or give them a raise. (:"}
{"text":"Love love love the food here!!! Mango chicken mmm! We get take out all the time and their food is always consistent and delicious! Make sure to get a cookie!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!   Great customer service, Great Menu and Delicious food. What more can you ask for? Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner you can't go wrong with Skinny Fats!   I truly love everything about this place although I wish it was a bit bigger and the floors are always slippery."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I always go here because it's just down the street from work and I have never had a bad meal. It is a little pricey though."}
{"text":"Love this place, go all the time. It's a great concept, where you can choose healthy meals, and meals that are \"happy\"   Service is always great, and I have yet to order anything from either side of the menu that I haven't loved! My favorite this is the T.A.B.L.T, it's a BLT with turkey bacon and avocado on delicious wheat toast."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what life was before Skinnyfats was built near my house. Sad... lonely... empty... Sriracha aioli-less.  Seriously, I find myself ordering off the \"fat\" side menu much more than the \"skinny\". I think they recently renamed a few items on the menu so I don't recall them (you'll have to check the descriptions when you go), but my favorites are the philly, the burger, hot chix, yummus, and slow boat to china. Also, truffle fries and the sriracha aioli (as mentioned above) are a MUST!   I'm not a huge fan of the juices. I do love their unique soda machine there. Also COOKIES. Yum.   Indoor seating can be cramped in certain areas of the restaurant. Outdoor is nice when the weather is right. I really like ordering online and then swinging in to pick up."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are tasty, I'll give them that. However, the service/organization is not good. The whole counter ordering process is a traffic jam, and pickup orders suffer the consequences. My husband was set to pickup our food at 12:50pm, but there was no indication at the restaurant that he should skip the counter line and go to the register, and no one was announcing that. So he waited in line for 10 minutes. At 1pm he was finally helped but was told the order wasn't ready yet. Really? He was able to get our order finally at 1:08pm (almost 20 minutes after the scheduled pickup time). His chicken was burnt, and I was supposed to get cucumber/yummus as my side but instead got very oily fries that were inedible. We are not impressed. For $25 I would expect the food to be ready on time and be, you know, what we ordered."}
{"text":"The best food in Vegas!! The fresh options satisfy any vegetarian or vegan even! Their fat options are tasty and very filling. You must try their sodas! They don't taste like normal soda, they are way better!!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place EVER. I hit it ever time I'm in Vegas. Wake N' Bacon is to die for...."}
{"text":"Legit, really high quality food and very tasty. Had the potato pancakes called sweet brown and the cluck moo, both very good. Also had the green mile smoothie drank and it was really good as well. Prices are more than reasonable for the portion and quality of food. Enjoy"}
{"text":"They stopped selling the Sweet Brown Pancakes, total bummer, not my fave breakfast place in LV anymore."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Love the menu & unique flavors. Nice build-out. My only gripe is that the line is a little long sometimes, but that is to be expected for good food. Not too expensive, either!"}
{"text":"This is a great place off the strip to have brunch/lunch. They have a good variety of food options for vegetarians, gluten free, and meat lovers. My husband LOVED the November special Pilgrimedict. It's a turkey meal with the added poached egg and cornbread stuffed waffles. I took a bite and admit it was pretty tasty even though I'm not a fan of traditional turkey meals. The waffles were moist and crispy on the edges. I got the Stuff on Curry bowl and found it underwhelming. I thought it needed a bit more sauce or flavor....though I did avoid eating the jalapeño slices to spare my tummy from the burn. There were so many things I wanted to try off the menu. We watched many people reciving their meals and they were all presented really well. The staff were friendly and explained the ordering process knowing we were first time customers. It's a busy place so you may need to wait a little to find a seat after ordering your meal. We will try takeout on our way to the airport."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food! They have a little bit of everything... something for the healthy and something for the yummy fatty stuff! First time and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"PI live a good burger and Skinny Fats does not let me down. Their accuracy of getting my order correct is an epic fail. I have eaten a this location few times and they have screwed up my order 3 of the 5 times I have eaten here. That's a 40% success rate and a fail. I would give them a higher score because the food quality is top notch but they are slow to redo my order whether its busy or slow. They should work on that. I dont think I can come back to this location again. I will try the other Vegas locations to see if the other cooks can read."}
{"text":"The immunity booster juice is my standby for any time I feel like I've been exposed to too many germs or feeling run down. I picked up the juice and the Tu Nuts ahi tuna in a cucumber boat appetizer.  I asked for no mayo but the cole slaw on the cucumber was covered in mayo I didn't think it would be. However the tuna was fresh and flavored just right I like the almonds sprinkled over with the avocado compliment. I would order again without the slaw."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!  I have been procrastinating this review for months.  This is definitely a hidden gem that I make a point to introduce to my tourist friends.  Great selection of deliciousness . Can't wait until the new location opens on Durango.  Space is limited but high turnover of tables.  It was probably not a good idea that I came with 8 people once but it was manageable.  Dylan was awesome at accommodating us, or was it Dillon? I get them confused.  Everyone on the staff is very welcoming though.    Hands down, my favorite is the Chix on Broadway - chicken sandwich with great flavors and BACON!!! yum.  Chicken is perfectly moist and juicy.  Comes with a side, I usually get the truffle fries.  Even their ketchup is amazing: choice of regular, jalapeno or balsamic vinegar.  Want something more breakfasty? Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis is a great alternative to the Chix on Broadway.  Same juicy fried chicken tenders but served on a buttermilk waffle.  I usually order \"Orange you happy\" as my beverage - I order it with ice cream but for the health conscious, you have the option of adding frozen yogurt.  Cold pressed juices are available and delicious but usually \"too healthy\" for me.  I've tried the Hangover Remedy, Mr.Green and Liquid Defense.  I tend to hover on the \"happy side\" of the menu, I call it the \"fatty side\" but I've ventured to the \"healthy side.\" Slow Boat to China's has a great presentation.  Asian chicken salad served on a cucumber \"boat\".  Ahi Srirachi Taco is good but I preferable it's evil twin Ahi Taco-San, served on a puffed shell.  FYI, one taco is nicely sized.  Other faves: Drunken Monkey Cakes, REDiculous (red velvet waffle), Bomb Diggity (BLT), Protein Pancakes Check out the special of the day too!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and was kinda disappointed again. So were both my sons. The best thing about the entire dinner was the cream soda."}
{"text":"Loved it! The food was great, I had breakfast from the Happy side if the menu and I was definitely happy! The avocado on my breakfast sandwich was fresh, the bacon was the perfect combo of crispy and juicy, and the Hawaiian roll was amazing as always!! I also had to try the Balls appetizer but I was too shy to say my order loud enough for the waiter to hear me so she was gracious enough to not make me repeat myself lol. So glad I ordered them because they were great too! My husband had a wrap fro the Healthy side and the fresh spinach and cheese was great!"}
{"text":"Tried Skinny Fats today. Food was nothing special . Tried the cluck moo and wrap supastar. Plain and didn't get what I asked for . We got a free cookie because of their promotions which was good but that's about it  The workers were VERY VERY rude and answered with attitude and ignored me standing at the front of the register for approximately 5 minutes when I needed silverware . I would NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place good vibe and people! Going back again soon!  I got the chicken and waffles Ohhhmami!!!!   If you have try this place most recommended spot to go to!"}
{"text":"I wish we had one of these at home! We got the curry rice noodles and Thai salad. It's really busy at lunch and we almost didn't have a table so just make sure you grab one as soon as you see it open up. Try the cool ketchups! Black pepper was really good with the fried pickles (chips!! V impt detail). The hangover juice was alright, had a lot of celery in it for my taste but it was good and really fresh. Salted Caramel Cookie was a perfect dessert. We def were on the \"fats\" side."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. The staff was very friendly! The caulifire not my fave I like to cook so in my opinion it was to hard for that dish. The consent was great."}
{"text":"First time here and was definitely not disappointed. Excellent food and service. My party ordered the Smoke in a Bowl, Steakation, Nice to Greek You, The Classic, a side salad, truffle fries, and a side of NY strip steak. We loved everything!   The place was pretty small, seating maybe about 30 people, but luckily we found seats.   We will definitely be back here the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"You HAVE to stop in here. This is one of my favorite spots in Vegas. Nice casual atmosphere. This spot is much bigger than the other by the 15 freeway. The staff is friendly and welcoming and very helpful. It's nice when you can come into a casual restaurant where the staff is smiling and genuinely enjoying their day.   We ordered The Meltdown, Sweet Cheese Us, Naked Chix, sweet potato fries, and truffle fries. All were so delicious. Sweet Cheese Us was the perfect amount of cheesy and spicy. The NY strip steak inside was very very tasty as well. Naked Chix was the perfect meal for a kid. It came with rice and chicken cut up with a light basil sauce. Our semi picky 2 year old ate it up!   Soda was also yummy. I love that they have natural sodas instead of the commercial stuff with all that syrup."}
{"text":"The food here taste so good when it is prepared correctly, I started eating here with the original skinny fats and was so excited to find out a new one was opening down the street!   However the first night I ate at this new location I found plastic in my food, annoyed, but the manager was there and gave me a gift card to make up for it, and the next time I came the food was great.   However the time after that I found hair in my food as well as in the food of the person I was with. I didn't bring it up to anyone because I didn't want to create a scene.   I ate here a few more times after that and the food was good. However, this last time I got a meal to go, my chicken was nearly raw in the middle and I couldn't eat my meal, because I got it to go I couldn't go and complain and instead had to throw my $8 meal away. I'm not one to write reviews but with so many incidents I just had to speak out.  The food is so good if only the quality was as well!"}
{"text":"Super hidden. Really small, dive type California style spot. Skinny: healthy choices, Fats: non-healthy choices. Not a ton of menu items, somewhat pricey for the portions. Overall, a good place for a quick bite. Just hope you can snatch a seat."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. I like the half healthy, half \"happy\" menu. Good variety and something for everyone."}
{"text":"Customer service is amazing, people were so sweet and eager to share their opinions on the food as well as serve you! GET A SHAKE! the shakes are amazing. Anything you pick on the menu is a good pick. I'm from California and SUCH A FOODIE, this by far topped anything I've had at home."}
{"text":"I had written off Skinnyfats as a place I was not interested in trying because the name sounds gross. After giving them a chance, I'm wishing for a Skinnyfats in my neighborhood!  I walked in at noon, not expecting much of a crowd based on the location, to find the lunch rush in full swing. The interior design is very vibrant, with fun painted walls and many unique touches. After reading over the many enticing menu options, I was ready to place my order at the counter. I went with the Skinny Bowl with a side of fat in the form of truffle fries. It was a perfect combo.  Both items were delivered to my table after a few minutes. The Skinny Bowl was the best acai bowl I've ever tasted, with granola, strawberries, bananas, dried cranberries, and agave syrup. The acai was a soft sorbet texture that had a nice, light citrus flavor to it. I've had this item at other places and felt like it was blended with too much banana, or had too much of a baby food texture. My daughter loved this acai bowl, too.   The truffle fries looked pretty ordinary, but they had great flavor. I'd never seen Heinz Balsamic Ketchup before, so that was a nice touch on my table. I was too distracted by the delicious food in front of me (and keeping my 11 month old entertained) to even realize that the long-haired man pictured on the Skinnyfats menu eating a burger was seated at a table just to my right, wearing the same purple Abraham Lincoln t-shirt featured in his photo.  There's plenty of food on this menu that I want to try, and I love that they serve breakfast all day! Check out the online ordering system for take out orders (bonus if you are within their delivery area!)"}
{"text":"SkinnyFats gets 5 stars from Me! They have great food! Prices are very reasonable. Ask about their secret menu and Sundae Special! All the employees are super nice!"}
{"text":"I didn't discover this joint until about 5 years after moving to Vegas (currently 7) and I am OFFENDED...OFFENDED none of my friends told me about. This place is fire. Lunch time (near my office) during the week... don't bother , too busy (Dean Martin location) but highly recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I had the caliFire which did not disappoint at all!  My boyfriend had the beef bowl and he lived it. The best part was the atmosphere!  The cooks are amazing. We watched all the different dishes coming out and now we have a long list of things we can't wait to try!!"}
{"text":"I like the new spot in the southwest, much cuter than the dean Martin location especially for the outside seating and lights.  Super cute inside. If it's cold and windy out don't sit by the door at the communal table cause people come in and out and you get everything blown over every few minutes which is annoying.  The communal table is cute though with the pallet stools.  Ordered Two things one yummy one not. The ahi tuna was delicious! The whole lot of mess fries not so much, too dry for me.  Lots of different things on the menu so will definitely be back to try more.  Breakfast is next!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, mixed with fun. Makes delightful food. Everything I have had has been delicious. Their soda's are pure cane sugar sodas and freshly juiced juices are fun to try too. I love their stuffed French toast!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! One of my favorite goto restaurants in Vegas! Always fresh and delicious. Sometimes the portions can be a little small on the healthy side though so it can seem pricey. The only thing is that this place doesn't have much seating so sometimes you have to take it Togo. Make sure to grab a chocolate chip cookie, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"Idk what to say. Im speechless....First of all, the rice was unimaginably undercooked. I felt as if my teeth were colliding with mini pebbles. The rice was soooooooo undercooked that it tasted as if it were picked straight from the rice fields in rural china and just thrown onto the plate. Cooking rice is a basic skill and they managed to mess it up. Second, they drowned my bowl in teriyaki sauce. The bowl overall was too sweet and made me lose my appetite. Im usually not a picky eater but i couldnt finish this $12 ripoff of a mea"}
{"text":"Such great food yesterday that we're going again today. Long line to order, but well worth it."}
{"text":"This place was such a treat for us! We were on vacation and stayed away from the strip.  Their menu is divided into healthy and happy (fatty). We got 5 things and everything was very good.   Most of the dishes were about $8-12. I got a green juice ($9). Very refreshing and healthy.   I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of the Ahi Sriracha Taco. It is one of my absolute favorites! I guess I should probably try the rest of the menu but I just love that taco. The people are so nice and the ambience is very casual."}
{"text":"I had the Sriracha ahi tacos and they were delicious! Funky vibe to the restaurant but very nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Woke up today craving skinny fats. This place is reasonably priced and open early for brunch. It's always busy which lets me know other people like it and come back! Anyways, I decided on the filet o fire. It's basically a steak sandwich with jalapeños, and I added truffle fries. Tastes pretty good next time I go I'm ordering off the \"healthy\" side of the menu ;) I'll be back"}
{"text":"For quick food this place is pretty good. I recommend the Chix on Broadway burger, it's a grilled chicken breast burger and the truffle fries go great with it. I also really like the fresh juice. Every time I come its always busy which is a good sign to me."}
{"text":"Love this place! My whole family absoletly loves ordering from here becuase their menu has so much to offer. I use the online ordering system since it is always busy. Just wish they had curbside delivery since parking is always an issue when coming in to pick up my order."}
{"text":"I ordered the stuff on curry without jalapeños because I don't like my food too spicy. I really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant. The workers were very friendly and the food was pretty healthy tasting but very delicious. It's nice to have lots of options when going to a restaurant like this and skinny fats has a lot of options!"}
{"text":"Great place, great food, and even more awesome employees (go Brucey!)  Get the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"Creative names and an ever-changing menu. It's good but there's not enough locations yet."}
{"text":"Wow, tried this place on a whim... it's a very small \"hipster\" restaurant. It's colorful and the atmosphere is welcoming. Studied the menu and the found out at the cash register that there is a \"secret\" menu... it's posted online. Definitely check that out!!!! My friend and I both ordered the shrimp tacos and an order of the Frickles. The Frickles were delicious fried pickles. The shrimp tacos were also spicy delicious! This place is no joke with the sauces and spice, so if you are sensitive, I suggest getting all your sauces on the side. My next visit, I'll be more prepared and will have studied the \"secret menu\" online."}
{"text":"Great little brunch place.  I was referred by a friend and was not disappointed.  Chicken and waffles tasted amazing, and the sirracha mango ahi tacos was amazing! Will be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Great place for a casual breakfast or lunch with so many options for anything you feel like eatin'.  FOOD Skinny side has a variety of veggie and vegan options, salads, and lighter fare. Fats side has burgers and fried chicken and the like. It's all delicious and the best part is, you can order from both sides!  DRINK Fresh pressed juices are delicious and not crazy expensive either.  SERVICE Joyful and friendly.  AMBIANCE It's a walk-up-and-order and you sit down with a number type of place so inherently casual. Nice wood interior with interesting grafitti style art on the walls. There's an outdoor patio too. It kind of looks like a cool cafeteria or coffee shop. Great for families or friends."}
{"text":"I ordered the Terriahi sandwich with the sweet potato fries and it was absolutely delicious!! Hands down the best sweet potato fries I've ever had, and the seared Ahi was amazing. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"Tried the Un-Brie-lievable and it was great, really sweet and rich in flavor. Also had a liquid defense cold pressed juice and it was un-be-lievable. They also have some very healthy options. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time in today with the family. Upon walking in, the restaurant was clean, the decor was really cool! And the staff is Awesome!!! Tone was there to help us decide what we wanted and explained the menu. He was friendly, kind and knowledgeable. So, we order. The food was beautiful, prompt, and soooo tasty! I had the More Cow Bowl. It was fresh, hot, and the flavor was prefect.  We also ordered the soda! And was Not Disappointed. I chose the black cherry which was not overly sweet and did not taste fake was it was explained it was made with real cane sugar.  Again, the staff is great, smiles, and just really kind. I have a special needs child and he was welcomed too.  FABULOUS FOOD! We will be back!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, then stop what you're doing, grab yo kids, grab yo wife, and go to Skinnyfats! I had heard really good things, and boy this place did not disappoint?! Everyone was super friendly and the whole place had a great vibe! A huge bonus for me is that the customer service was fast, even though? there was a long line! I ordered off both the skinny and fat menu, and BOTH WERE AMAZINGGGGG. More importantly, YOU HAVE TO TRY THE COOKIES!! Will definitely? be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The food is really good but it's a little pricy. Like you should get more with what you paid for. They're really nice, nice customer service, it's such a nice environment to sit in and eat. It's clean and spiffy. Nice area to sit in, they have a really cool table that you can sit in. The only thing I had a problem with is, again, the price of the stuff but I guess it makes up for it in the taste of the food. I would def recommend people trying it. I don't see myself coming here a lot but it's worth trying."}
{"text":"I really like the concept of this place. Half of the menu is healthy and the other half is artery clogging goodness. Great for couples or friends who have different eating habits. I usually split the difference and order from the healthy side but then add fried pickles or sweet potato fries as my side.  There is a cute little outside seating area and a large community table where strangers can sit together. They have free cucumber water. It can get really busy during lunch time and the parking is scarce. I've had to park over at the Walgreens a few times. The staff is friendly and it's always clean. I've brought 4 different friends here and they've all been jealous that this place is close to me but a long drive for them.  They have a secret menu that I noticed playing on a little TV screen or IPad next to the register. That's how I discovered the delicious frickles (fried Pickles). They're the best I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"What a great location. The service here from EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE was amazing, and come to think of it, it always is My boo is a very picky and difficult customer when it comes to her food but they got all of the requests spot on. I got the Happy Mess from the secret menu. Luckily I saw it. I've come to this location before and not ordered because I didn't think they had it.. Oh well. It was as great as I remember it being.   They really have so many great things! I love their selection of fountain drinks. You can tell they're made better. I have a weakness for Root Beer/Cream soda (here has probably the best I've ever had), and they even had a Birch Beer which was really tasty too. Employees there suggested I mix a couple of them together, and it didn't disappoint. Also, grab all of the Caramel Sea Salt cookies they have. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I loved this place.  We were here in December as a \"we need breakfast/lunch\" move before heading off to the Grand Canyon... (another story completely.)  It was awesome -- the perfect mix of healthy options and delicious feel-good options.  The restaurant itself is small -- we were lucky to stalk a table who was leaving shortly to be able to sit down.  it's a bit cramped, but the service is fantastic and the food..  Delicious.  Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Half the menu is good for you and half the menu is naughty but delicious!! Amazing sweet potato fries!! Fun atmosphere and super friendly staff... My go to spot now!!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite  spots to chow down. My only suugestion is that they make the place a little bigger, quarters get a little tight when i'm trying to take a bite of that delicious goodness and i elbow my neighbor.  Jusayin'"}
{"text":"Writing this review at SkinnyFATS as I'm waiting for my taxi. Decided on this place for dinner as I was looking for a healthy alternative to the many calorie packed menus on the Las Vegas strip. It's about a 10-14$ ride from most hotels on the strip.  The restaurant is on the smaller side; it has about 6 tables (Variety of 2/4 seaters). It also has one long table with 9 high chairs. You order and pay first then get your food brought out to you after taking a number.  As the name suggest; the left side of the menu is Healthy and the right side isn't :). For every regular dish; there's the same dish with a healthy twist on the left side. I ordered the Ahi-Tuna taco and the \"Cherry Popper\". Might I add very good way to pop your SkinnyFATS cherry :P. Burger was cooked to perfection; love when a restaurant throws an egg in a burger to bring it all together.   We went at 7PM on a Wednesday but it picked right up around 8 and many people didn't find seats. It's a small place but it's worth waiting around for a table to free up or taking it to go. The food is phenomenal and for the price you really can't beat it. To put the cherry on top; Kathryn A (working the register that's what the slip says :P) made my first experience great. She was funny and outgoing! 5/5 on food & service."}
{"text":"Delicious food giving away Prices are unbelievable stuff absolutely amazing setting love the patio the food was delicious highly recommended really on beatable"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another shot after being so bummed out the last time I was there. I went in with a clear head and came out much happier. I got the chicken and waffles this time since I knew it was going to be good. I came with my sister and we decided to share the plate with a side of fries - since its such a big portion. It was delicious and we finished all of it! I think I'm gonna stick with the un-healthy side from now on =P!  I also came at a less busier time. We avoided the traffic by coming in for a late lunch. I didn't have to worry about figuring out where to sit! I also heard that they're expanding... and opening new locations around the valley! How exciting.   Can't wait to see what SkinnyFats has to offer in the coming months!"}
{"text":"This location has a rustic hipster vibe with a very friendly staff. The hours are great for breakfast and you can order lunch as well. There is the healthy side of the menu as well as the more indulgent side if that is not your style. Order up front and they will bring your food to you. There is something for everyone and I would definitely recommend for families, couples and singles alike."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now. Their online ordering process is easy and fast and allows you to add tip by percentage (no math, yay!). Food has been awesome, love that they offer comfort food or healthy food. I am definitely becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time last week and it was great!! The food is fresh and cooked to order. Their soda machine is fun because it has different flavors then just your typical restraunt.You definitely will have to try their cookies as well because they come out warm! They have decent size portions but it is a bit pricey for lunch."}
{"text":"Meet asian persuasion family for lunch jump start Shirley B birthday part one at Skinny Fats. Half of us old timers where I was in the half of first timer. I never even heard of this place without help of  my yelp family. Its gotten lot of buzz hear people talking about SkinnyFats. I excited about checking the hype.   Talk about interesting location. I totally wrong turned it  so had too big circle loop back along way notice that nothing around it at all. If looking for restaurant never find it. It located in more of small retail business office area rather then free standing restaurant. Make sure going down Dean Martin Drive keep your eye out for the big happy smile face. Once you do find it realize SkinnyFats is diamond in the rough.   Never think such small office space that they could be putting out amazing Healthy or Happy side meals. They truly do!!! I was surprise by the selection too choose from since such tiny place. Really only hold less then fifty seats. We all meet up at craziest time lunch prime time. Literally if not for Mel and Terri showing up before or around 11am never got seat. Noon the place is ridiculous. The line out the door and good luck finding place too sit down. There reason why the place is packed really good food.  I went with the Phatty Philly. Amazing. I love the fact nice thick slices of meat not your typical philly style sandwich. Even the portobello mushrooms (perfectly roasted and well seasoned) nice thick slices. The goat cheese and the onions. Sure missing two more ingredients. It had lot of things going on inside but the BEST part was everything balanced each other too perfection. Every bite was awesome. The bread that the served on was great! Not sure if cause Happy side but my order came with side. I went with the truffle fries. I thought was solid. I love the condiments that each table came with especially the salt shaker. Flavor ketchup swear that was first for me. Balsamic or Jalapeno flavored ketchup. Interesting. I never tried either but next visit taste them with some fries.   The service was great. Even when it was mad crazy they did great job of keeping up on everything. They thanked you for your patience once got your food. Sure plan on coming back but not during rush hour traffic. Bit much."}
{"text":"Food was great really solid atmosphere. their coffee is the fantastic. friendly and knowledgable staff, Chase really helped us out. unique chill spot for breakfast brunch lunch dinner anything. go there."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try SkinnyFats other location for a while, so I was pumped when I saw this one was opened closer to my house!  We were greeted immediately, and asked if we had any questions, staff was very friendly. I ordered a Cranburkey Burger with a side of fruit, and my lunch pal ordered the Nice to Greek You flatbread. We both got fountain drinks and it was around $25, not bad!   I loved the decor, very bright and hipster/yuppie which I'm all about. I also loved that their fountain drinks were cane sweetened Boylan soda!! Awesome! And their cups are re-useable/dishwasher safe!   We sat outside and it was so comfy and nice. It would be awesome at night with the twinkle lights they have strung up.   The flatbread was a nice size, my companion didn't leave hungry, or overly full. Good toppings ratio, nice presentation.   My burger was great, I wish I had thought to add cranberries at home! The bun was delicious too. I appreciated that the burger wasn't loaded with salt, like at so many other restaurants, and the bun wasn't slathered in butter, but was still moist.   We would definitely come back here, both the healthy and happy sides of the menu looked delicious, and I LOVE the concept!!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is so good. Please try the big parm. It's basically a chicken parmigiana sandwhich so bomb!! I go there literally every other weekend."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Has the healthy AND the Happy. OMG the variety is great and the flavors are to die for!!  Definitely visiting every time we are in town!"}
{"text":"Wow! We were searching for an interesting and fun breakfast spot near the strip when we found this place. It is set in an unassuming office/industrial area across the highway from the strip but you can't miss the billboard!  The interior is done up in dark repurposed wood with a cozy, welcoming feel. The seating area features tables and counter space, we didn't have a problem finding seating even when they were pretty busy, though ymmv.  \"Happy\" and \"healthy\" headings on the menu add a little fun, but even the healthy options seemed pretty good! I tried options from both sides and was pleased - but the scrambled egg Mac and cheese (\"Morning Mac\") really scratched my comfort food itch! I also enjoyed the \"Wrap Superstar\" chicken, spinach & egg white breakfast burrito from the healthy side. Flavorful AND healthy? I'll take it!   We made several visits during our 6 day stay - it was just that good. The staff was friendly and helpful. Definitely worth checking out whether you're finishing up a looooong night or starting you're day fresh!"}
{"text":"I found this looking for yummy and kinda healthy placs to eat the minute we got to vegas. Man what a hit. Everyone cleared their plates in minutes. Yummy totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Never fails, Skinnyfats hit the spot again!! Went for breakfast this time and enjoyed the Wrap Supastar. It was  a huge burrito but I didn't feel full and heavy after I finished. It had egg whites, avocado, chicken and spinach with a really yummy cilantro, lime dressing. It was really good and healthy!! Love this place more & more!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out after all the hype I've been hearing lately. This place is literally right behind my job so I didn't have any problem finding it, however if you don't know the area well then I know others will be lost. HAHA.  Anyway, the space is small but I didn't mind, I was getting my food to go.  The menu is split between \"Healthy\" & \"Happy\" (or unhealthy) side, I stared at the menu for about 10 minutes and decided on the \"Healthy Side\"  I settled on the TBLT- Turkey Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato. with a spicy aioli spread on grain toast also had Truffle fries I wasn't down to pay $7 for a smoothie this day but maybe another day I will.  My sandwich was pretty good, a little dry, but I like my sammich with a little extra spread than what most people like. I guess if you want Healthy though you have to watch your serving size. As for my truffle fries, they were decent. My favorite still comes from BurGR.   I will be back here to try a few more items on the menu that caught my eye! :)"}
{"text":"This place is a must try! The restaurant is pretty small, but seating usually opens up fast. All the workers are really nice and helpful, which made me enjoy this place more. I love how they have a \"healthy\" side & a \"happy\" side. Tu-Nuts & Hot-Mame were my favorite. The Ahi tacos from both sides were also delicious. This will be one of my go-to eats!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here lately and things have really turned around from the first time. They are much more efficient and friendly. I know that when businesses start off that there's a lot to be sorted out especially if they are popular like this was when it first started so I'm actually happy to write an updated review to see that a shop made it. There are so many restaurants in Vegas that if one can make it in Vegas, thru can make it anywhere. Hopefully they keep growing. Good job!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was efficient. My kids liked it, and thought their rootbeer was good (except it's not traditional rootbeer, but I can't remember what they told me it was). Either way the kids liked it. The menu is interesting, with healthy options, and not so healthy options (hence the name). The place was very crowded when we got there and had to wait for a table to open up. I'd say the small, uncomfortable set up for the dining was the only draw back in my opinion. We went for dinner, so maybe other times of day are less crowded since it's in a business park area. Give it a try, you'll most likely enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"We used to go to the one located in Dean Martin, but since we came here we only come to this location on Durango. This one has the same great menu, but has waaaay more seating. The other location I felt like I started every meal upset because of the lack of space, organization and just general consideration from other people. This location even has a lovely outside seating area and a dedicated juice bar attached next door. Way to improve.   I love that their menu is divided in to healthy and not so healthy. Also, they only list calories for the healthy side. The kids both like this place, which is rare that they both agree on much and they have a cool kids menu with some good options as well.   One of my kids likes the chicawaffadopolis (chicken and waffles) but a good friend thinks the chicken isn't seasoned well and the waffle is nothing special. But we both agree that the Steak Eyes is really good. I personally like both sides of their menu.   They also have a digital frame that shows different specials they have going on. So be sure to watch that all the way through and see if something there catches your eye as well.  They have a nice variety of hot teas if you're in the mood and the coffee is decent and fresh."}
{"text":"My sister just came in town so I decided to take her here for her first meal in Vegas. We ordered the Greek flat bread and the chix on broadway sandwich. The food was decent but nothing to write home about, large portions though. It was a good experience until a guy (wearing a skinnyFats hat-I assume he works there) sat behind us and started filming the restaurant with this tripod. It was absolutely rude, especially since we were in a cramped space! We were having a nice meal and all of a sudden the guy is right on my back filming. Didn't even say anything to us before he started. As we got up to leave he didn't even move or say sorry for being in the way. Left a sour taste in our mouths so we won't be back."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats offers exactly what their name suggests, food options that are either healthy or happy (comfort food). When I 1st pulled into the parking lot I noticed that their location is a little odd and hard to find since it's located inside a business complex with no signage except for the sign above their front door. It was a Sunday just after noon and it was packed inside with no available tables and we had a group of 7 Yelpers. We looked over the menu and placed all of our orders when a couple tables freed up so we snagged them up.  Be aware that the food here comes in large portions! The wedge salad that Nelson Q got looked like it was made with an entire stalk of Romaine lettuce, it was huge! And the chicken sandwich that Amelinda L was eating had a piece of chicken that was larger than the buns/everything else on the sandwich! I got the chicken and waffles which is on their secret menu that you have to ask for... I'm not sure if there's an acutal menu or if you just have to know what's on it. I only knew about the chicken and waffles because I saw a bunch of people eating it. The chicken was nice, tender and their breading was light and not too crunchy/hard. I liked that there was more chicken than waffle, unlike other places that skimp on the chicken part so I was pretty happy. I didn't try any of their shakes or juices, but the strawberry lemonade was awesome! Light, refreshing and not too sweet. I also loved the reusable cups complete w/ happy meter!  I would definitely come back to try some of their other dishes, especially the healthy ones. If you come here during one of the meal rushes be prepared to order take out or wait for a table since they don't have very many and it's not a big place to begin with. Maybe they will expand someday to relieve some of the traffic here, and hopefully that new location is closer to me!"}
{"text":"The mango bowl was eh. My hubby really enjoyed the more meet bowl. Now the sweet potato fries brought this up from three stars to four. Nice and crispy."}
{"text":"Wow, was I impressed by this place. For me this is heaven. I can eat here without feeling deprived. I decided to eat skinny and my finance fat. Good compromise if you ask me.   Healthy or fat? Pick your poison. Warning, both are delicious and generous portions.   Scrambled burrito with egg whites, chicken, spinach, avocado and pico. Yum! It was a huge size. I could barely finish it. As I took each bite my taste buds never felt as if they were getting cheated.   We decided to try the skinny ahi tuna taco and the shrimp taco. The tuna one was gross. The soft shell was just that, soft. Actually I would say it was soggy. Everything just melted together. There was no crunch. The shrimp taco was way better tasting. However like the previous taco. this one was a fat choice. It was a bummer we had to eat it with a fork as it fell apart and was unable to be eaten. Boo. Tacos are  to be eaten with hands!  My fiancé's entree choice was another fat option. The fried jalapeño steak sandwich with French fries. My soon to be hubby is infatuated with spicy but boy did this bring tears to his eyes. Usually his asks for extra hot, add salsa and to kick it up a notch. Not this time ladies and gentlemen! He was peeling it open and trying to take out the jalapeños. Guess there's a first time for everything.   Can't wait to come back with some out of towners and update my review!"}
{"text":"We tried again, this time a couple days before thanksgiving and on a weekday lunchtime. Compared to the first time, the line was sane and the scene was chill - not like the mob scene we encountered last time. It worked well in our favor, along with the fact that we researched and decided on what we wanted among their extensive menu beforehand - last time we felt a lot of pressure due to the long line behind us and each menu item having lots of different ingredients to understand. So do your homework first!  We managed to get a table and polite and fast service! Among the smoothie juices, we tried the hangover remedy, garden treat, and delightful cucumber. They were all good. If you expect Jamba juice amount of sweetness, no - it's a more adult version with beets and cucumbers that are not so sweet. For our entrees, the More Cowbell, Meltdown, Smoke in a bowl, and Hot Chix. Hot Chix was spicy! with the fried jalapenos...I really liked it, and a good value for $10. Smoke in a bowl was a bit weird for us and it actually tasted better as next day's leftovers. More Cowbell was a favorite with high quality beef and lots of veggies. The Meltdown was just that - a big honkin' patty melt that made for 2 meals. A little on the greasy side, but that's the point. Our toddler fell asleep on the way so she missed her meal until later that night. The children's meals were good value and for the chicken, offered grilled. Compare their 4.95 chicken meal to Chik-Fil-A and it was a good deal.   I had thought they were going to expand the restaurant but it's still pretty tiny. So if you hit it on a busy day, which I imagine is very often, it can be overwhelming."}
{"text":"I went to Skinnyfats for the first time last week and I absolutely loved the food! I had the \"Hangover\" juice which was the perfect texture and just the right amount of sweetness. Others in my group all thoroughly enjoyed their food as well. Also, I would highly recommend their sweet potato fries. Yum! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was more eye appealing than good.  Always looking for a better breakfast and seems that I will continue to look  When I do go out, being comfortable is as important as anything else. Uhhhhh, the seating is far from convenient or comfortable   Guess I would compare SkinnyFATS to shake shack where my expectations were too high for the reality"}
{"text":"Had lunch here the first time with my boyfriend on a Saturday afternoon. I've heard about this place and wanted to try it out. My boyfriend ordered the Steak Eyes and I ordered the More Cow Bowl.   My More Cow Bowl consisted of Teriyaki Filet Mignon, Cauliflower, Portobello Mushrooms and Green Onions over Rice with Egg. The Filet Mignon was very tender and tasted delicious. The big chunks of Portobello and Cauliflower that they give you are delicious. They also don't serve too much but after you don't feel like you're stuffed.   My boyfriends Steak Eyes had country fried Filet Mignon medallions over biscuits with 2 over medium eggs and gravy. The gravy is delicious paired with the biscuits. The eggs were perfectly cooked and so was the filet mignon.   There are so many things you can try here, they also have fresh pressed juices that I also want to try.   The atmosphere is fun and energetic. Space is a little bit small for seating but luckily we were able to snag to 2 persons table."}
{"text":"This is the only location of SkinnyFATS I have ever been to, and I have to say I wasn't super impressed with the site. It's probably my least favorite set up of ordering food that could exist. I don't know about the other locations, but you go up to the counter to order, and they give you a number. You then find a seat, and they bring your food out. This entire space is extremely small too. They can maybe fit 25 people in actual seats. It was not busy when we went, and we had to sit at bar seating which looks out the window to the airport. It was fun watching the planes while I ate, at least. It wouldn't keep me from coming back, but like I said it it's my least favorite way a food joint can be set up and I wish it were bigger.   That all said, OMG THAT FOOD THOUGH. I liked everything I had except for the Ahi Taco.  Nothing about it was bad; it just didn't fit my particular palate. I didn't like how thick and strong the tortilla part tasted, I thought it covered up the flavor inside a bit.   The Slow Boat to China and Blue Balsamic salad were superb, and Balls 2.0 were absolutely necessary!! I wish it were four smaller balls instead of two big ones, just for ease of eating, but it was so good. I got their diet soda, and I prefer Coke/Pepsi to their own brand, but it wasn't bad.   I know this review sounds mostly bad, but believe me, it isn't. It's just easy to pick out the little problems when a place is so popular. The food is worth it. If you haven't had SkinnyFATS, you have to go! Also, it is a pokestop. Some players that were not us set up some lures while we were there and we got some cool Pokemon while we ate due to that so - pretty decent experience."}
{"text":"The service at this location deserves five stars. Super upbeat, friendly staff who seem genuinely happy to have you there.   My food, however, just wasn't very good. I got the Chix on Broadway (fried chicken and bacon sandwich with lettuce, tomato, onion and special sauce) with a side of truffle fries because it came highly recommended here on Yelp. Upon biting into the sandwich, I noticed that the chicken was almost burnt and the whole thing was pretty lacking in flavor. I'm not sure if they just forgot to add salt to the chicken/breading or if it's always like that, but even my boyfriend agreed that it was surprisingly bland.   Generous portion sizes but I probably wouldn't order that particular dish again. Hopefully it was just a fluke."}
{"text":"I ordered their secret burger which was advertised on their menu boards with a temp of med rare. Burger came out more med to med well. I had no time to ask for the burger to be recooked so I dealt with my meal as is and wont order a burger in the future due to cooks not knowing proper timing."}
{"text":"Awesome place....Ask for Lana she'll hook you up even if you're a pick eater like myself.  Cool vibe, good food, and you can choose....skinny or fat!   We had an egg white scramble w/a bunch of extra veggies in it....yumm!   Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Omg! Visited Vegas and came to this spot twice. It was so good. First time I ordered the French toast and it was amazing. Not too sweet and the orange sauce was delicious. Second time I ordered a burger and loved it even more than he French toast, which I did t even think was possible. Great spot. Line moves quick and they also have juice in reusable cups! Do they have a location in LA? I hope so! :)"}
{"text":"Berry Strong Waffle $8.50 Chickhumm $10 The Classic $10 Apple and banana shake $6  On my first impression coming here, the setting is very unique ala Carson Kitchen (Downtown LV). This location is located in a small plaza area which is kinda hard to find. Their menu is divided into healthy items and \"happy\" items.    The Berry Strong Waffle was ok tasting. The waffle was honestly a bit hard and the mint in the yogurt sauce was a little strong. The 2 cranturkey patties that came with it were not good. They were super dry. My wife liked her Chickhumm sandwich and she gave it a 9/10. I got the classic burger which was good. When I had to remind the waiter that she forgot my shake, they upgraded me to a large size which was nice. Their shake was pretty thick; so thick that 4 or 5 sips will make you feeling quite full. I will come back again to try the rest of the menu as their were some other items i saw  there that are worth trying. So for now, 3 stars..."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and food!  I had the STEAKation with avocado and sweet potato fries. My friend had Tu-Nuts and Caulifire. Everything was delicious. I wish the fries were a thicker cut though.  We waited literally only 5 or so mins for our food.  It didn't dawn on me to take a pic of the food but the presentations were just like pics I've seen online.   The establishment looked clean and nice. I liked the projection of the football game (on at the time) on the wall above the dining room. Made for a cool effect by using the bare wall vs putting a white screen up there.  I noticed the stools were made from what's looks like wooden palettes used for shipping cargo and topped with a padded seat of course, really nice idea.   The staff were super friendly and could see that they like working there. The cooks in the back were laughing and having a good time.  Definitely going to return and try some other menu items real soon. Great Job SkinnyFats!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this so we stopped on the way home from our weekend staycation for brunch.  Really small place, like don't bring a party of 6 and expect to sit together small.  You order a the counter and find a table. They bring the food to you when it's ready. The menu is split between healthy and non-healthy hence the name skinnyFats.  We ordered the traditional BLT with the regular ingredients, but instead of mayo, they had a lemon garlic aioli which was fantastic! Also had a TBLT which is a turkey bacon BLT from the healthy side. Also had pancakes from the fat side which were delicious. So many other options to choose from and did not know they had a specials menu at the front on the giant ipad. Make sure you check that out because I was unaware it was there and would have maybe had something from there too. Definitely will come back, but the place gets crowded. There's only so many tables to sit at and a window bar. 1 picnic table outside, so be flexible if you can for seating purposes.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Chicken and waffles were amazing.  We will be back.  Menu looks really good."}
{"text":"Love this original and novel restaurant. On the lighter side, the arugula and grilled chicken salad was amazing. My son opted for the chicken and waffles, another good find."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb I got the wrap superstar today never got this before but everYthing here is great Been here before everything is great here good wait bomb wait amazing"}
{"text":"I had the cherry popper which was excellent.  Kind of pricey but it is Vegas I guess. Seems a bit of a hipster place which may throw some people off. It is pretty small as well."}
{"text":"The service is lovely, walking in there's a relaxing atmosphere and friendly service. It is self sitting but we sat down seconds after ordering on a Saturday morning.   PineappleJacks: the multigrain protein pancakes were filled with sweet pineapples, fluffy and absolutely delicious. No need for syrup! They are served with turkey bacon but next time we will make sure to ask for extra crispy.   Steak Eyes: they originally come with country fried filet but we opted for grilled. I love salt but this dish was so salty I couldn't take more than a bite.   Ahi Srirachi: love at first bite! Scrupulously delicious 'slaw chee' with the sweet mango pico was just too good for words.   We also ordered a cup of coffee which arrived in sweet happy mugs and a green mile juice which was fresh and refreshing.   Lovely experience, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service , and the burgers are huge!!!, The place have a nice outside place to eat, waffles are huge too, I Recomend this place !!!!!"}
{"text":"Delish doesn't cover it! Git the Sweet Cheesus (sp?), the 2 tacos (steak and shrimp) and the Big Parm. They were all really good. The staff was so friendly. Couldnt ask for more except...Please open one in San Diego!"}
{"text":"This place is utterly amazing.  A) the food is all healthy and they have some good gluten-free and vegetarian options.  B) all of their soda is made with real cane sugar and is delicious.  C) the staff is amazing; all extremely friendly and outgoing.  D) the food itself was bomb.  I got a garden salad which was actually pretty large for a \"side\" and it was, no joke, the BEST salad I have ever put in my mouth.  My husband and I will most definitely be coming back to this place.  Excited to try more of their food!  Merci, SkinnyFats!"}
{"text":"Skinny Fats owns all 5 of their positive stars that they've earned with an innovative, savory menu, friendly, enthusiastic staff, and forethought to serve locals while appealing to our healthy (though occasionally indulgent) lifestyles!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time this evening, wanted to see what all the hype was all about. Had the Bleu Balsamic salad and a Grilled Chicken Sandwich with a side of hummus. The salad was a nice size portion and was very filling. The chicken sandwich was good but could of been hotter."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with any food choice at this place! Skinny fats is one of my all time favorites! Great for breakfast and lunch. If you're in a hurry order and pay online, food will be ready in 10/15mins and then you can just run in and pick it up. The venue is small so if your planning on dining in leave extra time to wait for a seat. Delicious cookies too!!!!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and I like to try different types of food each time  and they been yum yummy. Definitely coming back for more taste testing."}
{"text":"Update: manager contacted me right after post, apologized and fixed issue. I appreciate that kind of service   Ordered last cookie, cashier forgot to give to me. They then sold cookie to another customer while ill waited for my food which cashier remembered to hand to them. Im left with two cookies but not the one i came in for"}
{"text":"The biggest reason anyone goes to a restaurant or any  establishment is for the experience. When you have an employee tell you what you can't have and has a conversation with co-workers about how there customer needs to just pick whatever is available and move on. Will be the last time that I will ever spend my time nor money. If the owner doesn't replace that morning crew quickly those doors will closes soon. If I could put a negative rating I would."}
{"text":"Place is fantastic but came on the wrong day Mothers day!!! My advice is not to come on a busy day. It was almost like extreme fast food,  and we were playing musical chairs with food. Food is amazing! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to give this place a shot since we live very close by.. This place was all new to us and from the reviews we had read we were so excited to try it out... When I walked in I loved the atmosphere and the interior design only thing I didn't expect from here was the horrible customer service that was about to unfold... The girl who greeted us and checked us out was very rude, when I walked in I thought it was a restaurant where people sit us down and so I said table for two and she chuckled and said must be your first time... I was slightly offended but it gets better... As I was trying to review the menu and order she was too busy chit chatting with her co worker to assist me in any way... I asked her for a suggestion and she just showed me the secret menu on the tablet that's displayed... So I had to choose based on a picture, because she made it seem like it was such a big deal to describe some foods I was interested in... After I ordered I had to check out and ask the girl at the counter my friend has my wallet let me grab it; please keep in mind my friend was sitting at the table by the fountain drinks. It only took me a few seconds to get it and she was already taking another customer and the girl had the nerves to tell me \"Oh sorry... I thought you'd take awhile\" from there I was beyond irritated and annoyed... The food was good but not as good as I would have expected, my friends sandwich tasted a bit blend... It really wasn't like a WOW experience for me... Maybe because I came with such high expectations and with the poor customer service we had received from the start I was let down... Overall it was just okay, but to be honest my first time would have been a lot better if there was better customer service. PS the worker should never tell a customer NO PROBLEM, when a customer says THANK YOU... Because there wasn't a problem in the first place, we say thank you out of courtesy and respect... In return I would expect a YOU'RE WELCOME"}
{"text":"Omg I fell in love! I have so many good things to say where do I start?  The menu is beautiful you have healthy and not so healthy , vegan and meat. They have options for everyone. The staff was helpful , young , and friendly. The vibe was so chill and relaxed and made me feel happy. It reminds me of greens & proteins but the food had so much more flavor , better options and prices. They have a  on the girls bathroom and  on the boys which I thought was funny and cute. The do juicing there which I live for and it's not outrageously priced like most juicing places. Even if you don't a completely healthy option off the menu you still feel healthy lol Just an overall delicious and relaxing experience!!"}
{"text":"Kinda hard to find.. It doesn't seem like a restaurant would be in that location. Really cool vibes inside...cool paintings on the walls... It was cool to see they had plug ins as well as USB ports. Awesome food and staff....Only complaint is it's a super small space but I would definitely go back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ive come here a couple times and always get there burgers... but they never ever cook then the way i ask and they take forever. I will not be returning after my last visit its not worth it."}
{"text":"Want something greasy? Meat eater? Want something healthy? Vegetarian? Vegan? Breakfast? Lunch? Dinner? Fresh squeezed juice? Well they have it!  I came here twice in 1 weekend. I had the mean bean burger on my first visit. I really enjoyed it. The bean patty had a good bite to it and had good flavor. I used some of their very own spicy ketchup to add some kick to the burger. I chose the cauliflower rice as my side. This was a bit on the bland side but still a nice addition to the burger. I would definitely order the burger again. On my second visit I had the blueberry yum yum French toast. This was very good and the berries were the perfect compliment. This really curbed my craving for French toast. Coffee is free before 11am.  The employees here are super friendly and helpful. They greet you as you walk in and thank you as you leave. The restaurant it self is also super cute. I felt such happy and positive energy during my visit here.   I know where my must go to place to eat is the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  The only reason why I'm giving it four stars is the price.  It's too expensive especially considering I can go eat a $9 steak across the street or hit up an awesome buffet for the same price."}
{"text":"This place is really good! Sometimes crowded but they are quick and friendly so you find a seat and get your food fast!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS in DTS just opened! They sell Craft beer and they have TVs and a patio. We ordered Dem Greens and a classic burger. My burger was cooked perfectly but I think I should have ordered the other burger with pepper jack cheese to add a little more flavor. I got a craft Pilsner beer and watch the game. We got some frickles too. No complaints"}
{"text":"We went to a baby shower this t skinny fats catered a few months ago and loved the food so we have been dying to come eat at the actual restaurant,  we finally are it here today and my daughter and I just found one of our new favorite places!!!!  We ordered the Tu-nuts and it was delicious I loved everything on it we also ordered the Ahi taco-San and they were so filling and I loved every bite,  the place is up beat and cute and I can't wait to come back and try several other things on the menu!!  Well done skinny fats!!!!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFats has my whole heart! When ever I am craving a juicy burger and fries I come to this place. While this place has a \"healthy\" and a \"happy side\" I always stick to the happy side because well ...YOLO!!! So far I have had the classic burger, the cherry poper burger, the chix on broadway sandwich, and the hot chix salad. Out of all of these my favorite has been the chix on broadway sandwich. The sandwich consists of a HUGE tenderized chicken breast, thick cut pieces of bacon, cheddar cheese, veggies, and a fresh lemon herb aioli. The lemon aioli was a suprise but it helped to add a dash of tartness to balance out the rich fried chicken. The portion of this sandwich is extremely large and I had  to share the last bit with my hubby. Pair it with either their truffle or sweet potato fries and you have got a winner!!!! As far as the restaurant goes the employees go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your meal. One time my husband's burger was over done and they quickly prepared him a new one and comped an extra side for him. SkinnyFats is a great place to catch a casual dinner, however I have yet to try their amazingly delicious looking  breakfast menu. It is definitely on my to do list though!!!!!"}
{"text":"Being the wannabe health nut that I am, I absolutely love the concept of this place. First of all, the name SkinnyFATS is adorable and really represents what this restaurant is all about. This restaurant is perfect for those with conflicting friends that 1. want to eat healthy 2. want to pig out. It caters to both which is awesome!  Located at a really random and isolated area but it was easy to find. From the outside it may look like a huge place but inside is quite tiny and has limited seating. They have some tables and a bar like area by the window. It's first come first serve seating so you might want to have a friend grab a table while you order. The atmosphere and decor of this place is so chill and cute! Very woodsy but also artsy as well. The service here is amazing! The workers are friendly and they give great recommendations.   They offer what they consider 'happy' and 'healthy' food on their menu so you have the option of going for either. They have an extensive menu with lots of options to choose from. I wanted something light for dinner so I ordered:  --Ahi Srirachi: It's seared ahi in a whole wheat soft taco with some slaw, mango, pico, and spicy yogurt aioli. The price is per taco and I ordered two tacos. I was going to order three but the girl advised that it may be too much so I listened to her. Two tacos was the perfect amount for me. This was so delicious it made my mouth water after the first bite. The ahi was fresh and the sauces and garnishes for the tacos made them the best ahi tacos I've ever tried. The mangoes were a nice touch as well.  I'm actually returning to Vegas this week, so I'll be making another stop to SkinnyFATS soon!"}
{"text":"Imaginative cooking, funny n creative menu, fast service, everyone acts like they are so happy you are there,  whether you order from the low fat side aka skinny or taste is only issue aka fat side you will love the food, prices are also fair and did I say the food fast great!"}
{"text":"Skinnyfats is one of my absolute favorite eateries in Las Vegas! First, I love that they have a skinny and healthy side to all of their meals. This concept really makes me conscious and aware of what I am putting into my body!   Typically, my go-to is the Veg-Which, which is a mushroom burger that is to die for! I'm pretty picky when it comes to burgers, but they lather this baby with tomatoes, jalapeños, sweet peppers, pickles and their special sauce! It comes with an amazing bun that is not greasy as well as your choice of a side! I always get the, \"yummus\" with cucumber to be healthier but sometimes I splurge for the truffle or sweet potato fries! As someone who doesn't eat red meat, this burger is one of the best and affordable vegetarian options and beats places like Yardhouse and BJ's by a landslide!   I love that they make all of their own condiments including hot sauces, ranch, spicy ketchup, and more! Also, they make their own soft drinks and beer! Haven't tried the beer but definitely going to soon!   Overall, SkinnyFATS is an innovative concept and a great combination of healthy and savory. So grateful to have this local concept in so many locations across the valley. The quality and the care that goes into creating such innovative food concoctions is refreshing! If you haven't been, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Love the concept of this restaurant! There's something for everyone: delicious and \"skinny\" choices for those health-conscious and delicious and \"fatty\" choices for those...not. I thought it was great how the skinny side displayed calories and the fatty side didn't.   I had the naked chix bowl: chicken breast, brown rice, mango salsa. It was soooo good! The chicken was grilled well - neother greasy nor dry. The mango salsa wasn't overwhelming and didn't drown the chicken and rice. If I remember correctly, it was around 400 calories and fit well within my macros.  My friends ordered the el presidente burger with fries, the lentil soup, the boat to china, and the hot chix bowl (buffalo chicken salad). Everyone finished their food so I'm guessing they found their food to be delicious as well.   The ambience was super chill and the restaurant was clean. Prices were reasonable for the amount of food and the fresh taste. Staff was friendly and offered great suggestions. Hope they expand to San Diego but until then I'm definitely going to come back whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time this morning with 2 people and I couldn't believe how empty it was!  When you walk in, you order at the counter and choose your seat after you pay.  If you order a soda/pop, you will be given a dishwasher safe cup (to take home) for Boylan soda (yum!).  They bring your food out to you and we didn't wait very long at all!    We all ordered from the \"happy\" side of the menu and we were glad we did because the food was delicious!  We shared the Chickawafadopolis (Chicken & Waffles), Cinnutella (French Toast), and Wake N Bacon (breakfast sandwich).  The chicken and waffles wasn't anything too spectacular, but the other two entrees were amazing- the Cinnutella is covered in cinnamon sugar and served on top of a Nutella/chili sauce... I would definitely order it again!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not exaggerating when I say I just had one of the best meals of my life. You ever eat something and the entire time you're thinking \"OhMyGodOhMyGodOhMyGod?\" That's what happened to me tonight. I had the TBLT with avocado and truffle fries. First, the sandwich. A subtle aioli spread beautifully complemented the fresh, multi-grain bread. The turkey bacon was cooked to perfection. The whole thing melted into my mouth, a cacophony of fresh, aromatic flavors. The french fries, good Lord, the fries. Best.Fries.Ever. Their scent alone made me swoon. Over and over, I'd hold the fry below my nose a few seconds, just to inhale it. Its scent was strong, nutty yet earthy. The consistency, light, a bit chewy with just enough crunch. I ate this meal like I've not known food before. Maybe I haven't. And I'm speaking as someone who at one time was well off enough to dine often in 5 star joints (things change, recession, blah blah).  Reading up about how one of the founders was a personal chef to Paul McCartney (I'm a musician and a huge fan) inspired me to drive the whole 6 minutes away from my office to try this place. I'll be back and often, with friends, family, co-workers, mailmen, gardeners, cashiers, CPAs, whatever, in tow. I love you, SkinnyFats."}
{"text":"Delicious Food and fun menu! Avoid going around noon, there's never anywhere to sit :("}
{"text":"Great variety. The menu has something for everyone. But it is all so good so why stop at one item? I order a few every time I go."}
{"text":"This place is great! The menu is genius weather you're trying to eat happy or healthy they have everything for everyone.  I tried the Thai salmon salad it was amazing.  Defiantly will eat here again."}
{"text":"Love the vibe and everything I've eaten here. Been to both Warm Springs and the Dean Martin locations, since one is close to work so go there for lunch, and the other close to home so breakfast or dinner. In other words, great food for any time of the day.   I always order from the skinny side, but tried the waffles and the pancakes from my niece n nephew. No surprise why they love them! One of their favorite foodie places too.    Had the Vegwich tonight and every part of it was yummy, but had a kick to it. Worth it for the taste. Favorite so far is the Wrap Supastar with eggs, avocado, and other yummy breakfast wrap stuff, and then the ahi srirrachi taco, which I got the first time and had several time since.   You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Unique menu with a focus on flavor and healthy options. It's a real Vegas secret breakfast/lunch spot. Definitely worth a try. I wish I had one in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Whether you're looking for something healthy or not so much, you will not be disappointed. I have yet come across something on their menu that I hadn't thoroughly enjoyed from the first to the last bite."}
{"text":"We loved every bite & can't wait to come again when we visit Vegas. My husband got the juicy Cherry Popper buger with a side of sweet potato fries & I got the Ahi Srirachi & Shrimp Tacodilla tacos. It all tasted delicious. The reviews on Yelp weren't lying when they said it was worth the trip out. We left happy & satisfied."}
{"text":"I love the whole 'healthy' and 'happy' menu concept... Lots of healthy choices, and lots of, lets say, decadent choices ;) we sat down and ate in their dining area for our first time visiting SkinnyFats, great meal great service great prices we def plan to come back but I think due to the VERY small dining area we will probably order to-go most of the time and just bring it home from here on out... it was PACKED and pretty much nowhere to sit during our visit, we got a seat a few mins after we ordered/paid but I really wish they had a larger dining area! Still, looking forward to trying one of their cold pressed juices!"}
{"text":"Pineapple and grape margaritas with some amazing tacos, yass please! I loved it. Even tho they don't have a full bar, they did take a long time to get drinks out but they make it fresh on the spot was what I was told!!"}
{"text":"I have never stepped foot inside the place, but I have had their catering and delivery on several occasions and am going to assign them the prestigious \"Best Delivered Food in Las Vegas\" award.  Ordering online is simple, the packaging is premium, delivery is quick, and above all the food is a better choice and delicious.  I thoroughly enjoyed the neato burrito and can't wait to try the waffle mountain high.  Adding the truffle fries is a must and there is always room for their choice shakes or juices."}
{"text":"Skinnyfats is a small hidden away restaurant just off the side of dean martin near the strip. Their small interior is a mix of cozy with modern, an compliments their equally unique menu which is split between as the name implies: a healthier \"skinny\" and more unhealthier \"fat\" side. A lot of their items are uniquely different from the next ranging from their ahi-cucumber boat, beet apple and ginger smoothie, to their truffle fries. Prices are reasonably cheap and its always interesting to see the new additions."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is hands-down one of the best restaurants in Vegas. I always make sure to stop here when I'm in town! With a healthy side of the menu and a \"happy\" side of the menu, there are things to please everyone. I order the mean bean, cranburkey, or the chickhumn, and each one is to die for. The cranberry yo on the cranburkey is so good, and it pairs especially nicely with their incredible sweet potato fries. Definitely order a side of those with whatever you get! Their water with cucumber and lemon soaking in it is super refreshing and a great touch on the best meal!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! I ordered one of their bowls and it was ok but the portion size was definitely not worth the price. Talk about ripping you off. Never again."}
{"text":"It was my first time for this location. I had the sweet cheese us. It was sooooo good!  I love their concept and the mural! Service was also great! Will definitely come back to try every single thing :)"}
{"text":"Omg. Me and my boyfriend always wanted to try this place. I had the Greek Flatbread pizza. So delicious. The chicken breast was piping hot yet tender ,juicy and wonderfully flavored. The portions are perfect for someone who cares about what they put through their intestines. I was amazed that I've never been to the place sooner. The staff is pleasant too and great at making recommendations."}
{"text":"Great and unique menu. Just don't order the French toast expecting classic French toast. I've tried many different items and they were all good except for the brioche French toast, was too sour. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"After my initial review I was contacted by a manager who offered for me to come back to the restaurant and try a few items on the house. While I was there I also tried a few things at my expense. We ordered the Greek flatbread, the Sweet Chesus, the shrimp tacos, and the salted caramel cookie. The Greek flatbread (Nice to Greek you) had grilled chicken, olives, feta, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, tzatziki, & balsamic glaze on a flat bread. It was 505 calories and I got it from the healthy side of the menu. For something that was supposed to be \"healthier\" it was pretty decent. My only complaint is that it had TOO much balsamic on it and I didn't see the point of the giant chunks of cherry tomato. Perhaps it would have tasted better and I could have finished in the restaurant, if the tomatoes had been thinly sliced and there had been less vinegar because it was SO bitter. On a scale one to ten the flatbread scored a 6. I probably wouldn't order it again to be honest.  The next thing I ordered was the Sweet chesus which is skinnyfats take on a philly cheese steak. It's made with shaved ny steak, pepper marmalade, onions, pepper jack cheese, portobello, cheddar sauce on a hoagie. This was one of the best philly cheese steaks I've ever had. The meat was tender and the bread was soft. I'll definitely eat it the next time I return. (8/10) skinnyfats offers two tacos for 7.95 which I thought was pretty good deal for a sit down restaurant and You can mix and match! I chose two shrimp taco-dillas: tempura,spicy slaw, pico, chipotle aioli, pepper jack cheese, in a quesadilla shell. Let me tell you, these were the best shrimp tacos I have ever had. The combination of the slaw and chipotle sauce made it sweet, salty, and spicy. So far these tacos are my favorite thing to eat on the menu and if I could eat them everyday I would. These tacos were absolutely AMAZING. (10/10) Lastly I had a salted caramel cookie and my mom who isn't a huge fan of sugar took one bite and fell in love. She said this was the best cookie she's ever had. The cookie could be described as how it taste to eat a really good slice of cake. All that was missing was some vanilla ice cream. Go order one of these cookies. You won't regret it! (10/10!)  All in all, this was an epic experience and I'm renewed as far as my thoughts about this place goes. Great customer service and great food. I cannot wait to come back and try the other food. SkinnyFats is a place you go if you're not afraid of flavor. Oh and the free wAter (so freshing) is a bonus! One of the best places in Vegas to eat. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"This place is amazingly delicious. Not much room for seating and it always busy. Try going for brunch to miss some of the crowd. Looks like an industrial  dive outside but is great inside."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and the Defense juice combo was amazing. A must eat. Get the steak eyes and the defense juice."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and I love it! I had the S'motherload and my friend got the #Merica. Both are awesome and highly recommended!  The place itself is really cute. Paintings of fruits and stuff all over the walls. The atmosphere is really nice.   The service was fantastic! Nikki, Kathryn, and Kendra were all really friendly.  They took great care of us. It's hard to find restaurants with good food and good service but these guys are nailing it. I'll definitely return to try that red velvet waffle!"}
{"text":"I love this place with all my heart! Best mimosas with fresh squeezed OJ. The food is amazing and healthy. I wish their was a Skinny Fats in Los Angeles. I would give this place 10 stars I ate here more than twice during my 3 day stay in Vegas."}
{"text":"Yummy! The chicken on my flat chix and greens was very moist and well seasoned. I wish the truffle fries were a bit more truffle-y. The best was the warm oatmeal cookie! It knocked my socks off!"}
{"text":"Great place, really reminds me of home! (Melbourne) Chix on Broadway is the best Chicken burger you will find anywhere in this town! Of course add the avo!"}
{"text":"Extremely long wait times which is unfortunate because the food is good. However, even uncooked meals take a long time do make sure you do prepare."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The food is great. It is off the strip and worth the trip. The place does not look like a restaurant it is in an industrial park and from the outside you would never guess it is a restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!  Amazing tasty food and juices!  Loved this stop on way to Vegas airport on the way home."}
{"text":"Absolutely without a doubt my favorite lunch spot. Order online or via phone to avoid a wait-worth it regardless. Can't wait to welcome them to Warm Springs and Durango later this month!"}
{"text":"food is not as good as I hoped.  smotherload not that great.   happymess was a disappointment.  the one eyed monster was great and the chicken parm sandwich where hits."}
{"text":"As far as food goes, this place rocks! I tried a few different things on the menu and everything was delicious and fresh. The service was good and the place is cute. Only negative thing I'll say is the bathroom area was dirty! The hallway to the bathroom was pretty gross. So someone like me wonders how clean the kitchen is :/ But I'll pretend it's clean because the food is yummy!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is mmm mm good! I came a little after the lunch rush. There was a line, but it sped by quick. I ordered one of their daily specials: a delicious creamy pasta with shrimp and scallops. Didn't expect the pasta to turn out so good! But it was cooked to perfection. The server even let me add garlic toast on the side to compliment my dish.  I love how they have both #livehealthy and #livehappy options on the menu. Definitely went for the happy side, but I'd love to try something healthier next time. My brother ordered a breakfast dish with chicken fried steak and eggs - it was scrumptious as well!  I'm only visiting Vegas, but everything on the menu sounded great so I'll have to come back to try more. A great spot for lunch. The location is pretty random at the side of the highway, but I suppose that gives it more character in itself. Loved the atmosphere and the wall art. I wish Houston had a food spot like this. Easily one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"Not my first visit, most definitely won't be my last either. Pricey but good food. Give it a try if you haven't before. They have something for everyone in your party."}
{"text":"Expect a wait that's well worth it. The food is all good. The juices and smoothies are good, as well. Try the salted caramel cookie for dessert. It won't let you down."}
{"text":"The staff is extremely friendly & always smiling. I love the food here, it's definitely worth the cost. Everything is organic & delicious. I'm very satisfied with the service I was given, I will return for more! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I never heard of this place til I got to Vegas.  Looked at the reviews and the menu and I was sold.  Not many fast food places have plenty of vegetarian options. But this place had the options and taste for vegetarian/vegan food. The smoothies was really tasty and I ordered avocatofu sandwich.  Really good!   Will come back when I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Love love love love this place! I have to come here for work and eat here almost every day if I can sneak away. Pleeeeeeease open a skinnyfats in Santa Monica or Venice!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place to go. The food is simply delicious, in the highest sense of the word.  A few things to note:  Current location is small, if you're coming with a group I recommend that someone in the party arrive early to steak out a table.   Mobile App - They do have a mobile app that you can use to order ahead and miss the lines that can quickly grow.  However viewing the menu in person is a huge treat in of itself.   Food - The food is very creative, and weekly they have new specials, they are usually posted in a glass holder on the edge of the counter.  Try these out as they may not return!  The staff is so friendly and nice. The restaurant industry should pay the management here for some training.  A must see, must eat place in Las Vegas.  Located in an industrial office area you may drive right past it, just passed the railroad tracks. Great for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I wish they would expend their seating/space because it's so popular. Very clean and well run, the staff is amazing and friendly. Food came fast, and not too pricey. I had the chicken and waffles. Unreal."}
{"text":"We were out last Saturday and looking for somewhere different to eat and stopped into SkinnyFATS and what a great place to enjoy a meal.  The atmosphere was great.  The staff was so helpful and nice.  The food was even better than expected.  It was a great time.  The fried pickles were great.  The spicy tortilla soup was so good.  Everything we had was great. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"To be skinny or to be fat: that is the SkinnyFATS question.   An American culinary fusion of wraps, salads, burgers and bowls, choose from one of the two parts of the menu: the healthy side, or the not so healthy side. I'll admit, I chose one of each, which my heart gratefully thanked me for but my waistline hated. Order at the counter to dine in or to-go, and wait for your stomach to enjoy.   Be forewarned: the font size of the menu is itty bitty tiny. So, if you're blind like me, remember to grab your reading glasses out of the car.   The atmosphere is welcoming with a 70s hippie, modern hipster vibe that makes your tofu bowl and brown rice fit right in like a hot dog at a baseball game. Don't worry, they'll welcome your fried ahi burger too.   They also have their beer license, which complements well with their large TV projector against the wall. Watch a sports game with some truffle fries, and appreciate the SkinnyFATS joys of life."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with SkinnyFats. Great service and food at great prices. Love their 420 menu."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! Very interesting and delicious food. Amazing design and great background music. Try their daily specials, they will surprise you in a good way. This place should have 10+ stars."}
{"text":"I really liked the food it had great flavor, service very nice awesome attitude!!! EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"I love eating at the warm springs location, thought I would have the same experience here... this is more of a \"to-go\" location. Food was still as tasty, but with such limited seating, be prepared to watch people eat in hopes of snagging their table, have people then watch yours, or hear an endless amount of \"do we just leave our name and you'll call us when our table is ready?\" type questions from people who don't get what the line is for."}
{"text":"Loved it! I love the options of Healthy and Happy! Basically leaner options or treat yo self options. We ordered the Skinnyfats punch, Orange Carrot blend juice, and a coffee to drink. All awesome. And then we ordered chicken and waffles, a lean egg white with turkey bowl, a tomato soup, and an egg white and veggie sandwich. All AMAZING and guilt free honestly"}
{"text":"Love love their theme. But man the food is insanely tasteful. I have a loss for words......"}
{"text":"The place is amazing. You get a feel of a very young and hip aroma. It's very colorful especially for a small little dimmed place. The parking is a small area and I recommend you order out because it gets super busy. The service is great, they help with a smile on their face and their vibe is amazing just like the place. But this review isn't just about location or the way the building looks or the people. It's about the food too. The food is great definitely healthy even the drinks although most of the drinks we got aren't sweet because they're very based on the healthy part like the punch we got was sour and the teas aren't sweet so if you want it sweet you'll have to ask for sugar. The food was healthy they definitely have all the food category in it but it's SUPER oily or buttery. Just know you'll feel healthy and full but also like you just drank a cup of oil/butter. Use lots of napkins. Over all I feel like it's a one hit wonder to me. I guess I was just expecting it to be less oily/buttery."}
{"text":"Poop poop poop!!!! Tried this place a few times and definitely not worth what they charge!!!!! I heard so many great things about this place but it's so not worth it! I'd actually rather eat through a fast food drive through! And I hate fast food! Awful service, awful food and overpriced!!!!! I have y'all a few chances and never again!"}
{"text":"I'm in here at least once a week. Love the Balls 2.0, the buff chix, more cow bowl, caulifire, pretty much anything that doesn't have seafood in it I've tried and there's nothing I don't like. Staff is super courteous and attentive. Always clean. Love it"}
{"text":"This place is so cool. Great service and friendly informative about there food. I loved the coffee with the view opens at 9 am and watched planes with a great view of the airport and mountains. Good thing it was cheat day on my Diet. The red velvet waffles have real buttercream frosting yay. Ordered two breakfast to carb load and walk the strip today. Better if you don't want Vegas buffets and chains. They have another location near sunset park too a lovely park with ponds and desert plants. Thank you. -Luke"}
{"text":"Always delicious good & service. I normally would always eat on the skinny side but this last time going went to the fatty side. Amazing"}
{"text":"Great customer service along with healthy food with lots of flavor. Great place to easy!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Tu-nuts is possibly the most amazing thing we've ever tasted!! Cauli-fire was delicious also. I had the More-cow-bowl and my husband had the Teriyahi.  Both of our entrees were absolutely wonderful! My daughter had the chickhumm and she said it was good but she liked ours more. The girl at the counter was very sweet and welcoming and took time to answer all of our questions.Definitely will be going back, might fly out to Vegas just to have dinner here again!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for some time now, and we were finally able to try it yesterday. The service was great. Every employee we encountered was very friendly. I got the Berry Strong and my husband got the S'motherload. My dish was very tasty, and I will definitely get that again. My husband really enjoyed his burrito- he also said that he would get it again. The only thing i would change about this place is their coffee. It didn't have much taste to it and wasn't strong. One of the best things about breakfast is being able to have coffee to enjoy with it, so that is my only complaint. But both my husband and I will go here again."}
{"text":"Not to my taste for brekafast. Had a zucc it and it was very bland, flatbread had a lot of vinegrate which made the falvour overpower the pizza, the kne star would be for the orange juice for it was good"}
{"text":"Tried this little spot.  A little crowded.  Thumbs up for chicken and waffles.  Thumbs down for the WTFrench Toast (soggy everything)."}
{"text":"Such great bowls and salads. The workers are also super sweet and helpful. I definitely recommend this place. The atmosphere is chill and laid back. I love that it's off the beaten path & off the strip for a breath of fresh air. Don't let the location confuse you--it's in a corporate park. Ask the workers for their recommendations on which meal to get!"}
{"text":"I love the concept - You have 2 sides of the menu (healthy life vs happy life).  Eat healthy or eat bad - I went with the bad but got a healthy juice to counteract it..=P    I got the chicken & waffles, which I thought was okay.  They used chicken tenders instead of bone-in chicken.  The chicken tender was a nice twist, but I prefer the chicken in bone for the juiciness.    We also ordered the truffle fries.  So, why the 2 star?  Well, one of my pet peeves is that the food should come out hot.  The food we got was luke warm to warm only.  It was like it was sitting out for awhile.  The fries came out first and it was luke warm, so maybe it was just the fries - NOPE.  Our meal came out and it was warm too.. Not a good sign.  they need to get the food out quicker to the customers or invest in some heat lamps to keep it hot.  I mean I like the concept, just need a better execution in bringing the food out hot."}
{"text":"I love skinnyFats but I had the worst customer service ever, there's a sign that says \"skip the line if you order to go\" my order was to go so when I asked the employee KEVYN for the menu he gave me an attitude saying I have to order in the regular line then he said never mind order here while I was ordering he had this face that he did not want to be there he was being rude and giving me faces and talking like a smartass he does not belong in there he probably had a bad day but he shouldn't take it on the customers never coming back to that location or any at all, it killed our experience waste of money he didn't even get my order right and charged me for extra ranch also we asked in a nice way that there was not passion tea and it took them literally 20 minutes to go check the tea machine. Don't even bother to go there."}
{"text":"Dont get me wrong but my first visit to this location I was in love, happy that finally found my favorite restaurant, then we went to the second location (W Warm Springs) and order the shrimp tacodilla the side rice was delightful we literally had the nicest lunch ever, but then yesterday we came back to this location and the rice had so much lime in it wasn't edible. I order something I haven't try before the chix on broadway i don't know if the chicken it's supposed to taste like oil , fryer taste. It was disgusting. Wont be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Every was very good especially the sweet potato fries their classic burger and their chicken waffles"}
{"text":"I'm the food was amazing.  I had the sweet potato pancakes with bacon. Bacon cooked perfect.  The special sportier of breaded risotto ball on top of pesto dip with tastes greens as garnish.   Sooo good,  the one cashier girl was very friendly and nice.  The Only drawback is the place is small, but we did manage to get a table quick.  The food comes out quick and hot!  I would def come here again ."}
{"text":"This place was incredible!! The service and food was delicious! We had a group of 19 people and the community table in the center was a hit.  When we got to the restaurant, the staff accommodated us and opened up a second register. After we placed our order, we only had to wait about 15 minutes before our food arrived- and everyone's food was delicious and no complaints!  We will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food... great option... easy to find a place to sit even though it is usually packed."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! The staff needs to not be gossiping behind the counter when there are people waiting to order. Other than that, we got our food quickly (wasn't crowded) and the chicken and waffle was probably the best I've had around. They were sweeping around our table as we were eating-not cool."}
{"text":"Tiny place with HUGE flavor!  The food is absolutely fantastic.   The service is outstanding. This place is very small and therefore is a bit uncomfortable when it is packed.  Good luck getting a seat during peak hours. Also,  they are so extremely busy at times  that mistakes do occur.  However,  they always handle the situation well when things go wrong.  The manager reached out to me after a visit and went above and beyond the call of duty to make it right.  Thank you Reed.  If the dining room was twice as big it would get 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Customer service as well. I recommend their entire menu. I always want to try something different when I come here because everything looks good. I was bummed they took away the Drunken Monkey though. I really wanted to try it."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!!! This location is always busy but the service is fast. Most food has a lil kick of spice, even if it doesnt state it in the menu. But its not bad at all. Love all the healthy options. Make sure to try the chocolate chip cookie or the raisin oatmeal cookie, both are delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Stumbled on this place trying to find some healthy food options and we were very impressed. The Slow Boat to China was amazing. We also had the TATS but with regular bacon and it was great. Their sweet potato fries are crispy and delicious. We will definitely be back next time we are in town.   We need to find a way to get you guys in Encinitas, CA."}
{"text":"I read a review that said a take out order took forever and the food was then less than appetizing ... I should have listened to that one.   I ordered the buffalo cauliflower which was really good and spicy, but with just a handful of florets, not worth the price.   The zucchini noodles were bland. I had to add a lot of salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes to give it flavor.   When I went to pick up my food, it sat and sat forever and  there was no order or structure for pick up orders. By the time I got home, both the cauliflower and zucchini leached a ton of water and it just wasn't pleasant to eat. For $15 (which isn't a huge bill), I was pretty unsatisfied.    UPDATE: I tried this restaurant again hoping I would have a better experience. The main issue is the lack of organization with pick up orders. After waiting in line behind people ordering, I got to the register where I was informed pick up orders should be picked up at the bar. A sign at the bar stating \"pick up orders here\" would be helpful.   I ordered buffalo cauliflower again, but this time they forgot to add the yogurt sauce that comes with it. Again it was small, so this must just be the normal size.   I added chicken to the zucchini and it was pretty good. The naked chicken with balsamic, capers, and arugula was really good, and the caper dressing was great.   The side of cauliflower was pretty paltry. I was shocked to open it and find the container not even half full. I would say maybe a quarter cup. It was very strong on the garlic and I didn't really enjoy it.   Second time with take out and just okay. Maybe dining in would be a better experience?"}
{"text":"Went to eat here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. There was a line of 3-5 people the whole time we were there. Seating is very limited but from the looks of it people did not mind. It was our first time here and did not know what to get. Menu offers you a healthy option and happy option. I ordered the cherry popper and the wife just had a classic. Order was out within 4 minutes. Sweet potato and truffle fries were amazing. Burger was a different taste than normal. The unique combination of flavors blended well together. Overall a great experience. Would definitely come back and try other options. A must try for those looking to eat something they wont have anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is a true 5 star restaurant, start to finish.  I ate here for the first time several months ago and was really impressed. A lot has changed in the time since my first visit. My wife and I decided that we needed a major lifestyle change, we needed to be more conscious about the foods we were eating, needed to eat out less, and just start living healthier. In a perfect world you make breakfast, lunch, and dinner at home, you never eat or drink bad, you are in peak physical condition, and you live to 110. That's a perfect world. Now reality. It's fun to eat out, cooking schmooking, exercising schmexercising, you know how it goes. I'm happy to say that we've changed a lot in our lives from an eating standpoint that's really helped.  So where does Skinnyfats fit into this? Well they fit perfectly because of the incredible healthy options they have. During some holiday shopping we needed to find a place to grab dinner and wanted to be health-concious about our decision. Skinnyfats was the perfect choice. I went with the Wrap Supastar and it was absolutely awesome. Fluffy egg whites, avocado, chicken, pico de gallo, and spinach in a delicious wheat wrap and topped with a lime/cilantro yogurt dressing and some additional pico de gallo. It's honestly hard to believe that this was healthy. The portion since was huge. My wife went with the Vegwich. I'm not much of a mushroom man, but she said it was absolutely awesome. Unfortunately I didn't grab a picture of it, but that was also really big and was accompanied with a side.  **Confession** on my first trip here I had a chocolate banana milk shake. On this second trip I had a chocolate banana milk shake. It was a weak, but totally worth it moment. I don't know how they are able to perfectly incorporate the banana into the milk shake, but they absolutely do. No banana chunks, so smooth and amazing tasting. They have a wide array of shake options, definitely check it out if you' feel like \"living happy.\"   The location is kind of hidden on Dean Martin. It would be super easy to drive by and never notice. I think that adds to the coolness of the restaurant. Service is always dynamite. They play great music as well. This place just kills it in every area - food, service, ambiance."}
{"text":"Service was incredible, friendly, knowledgeable, welcoming. Atmosphere was clean, contemporary, comfortable.  Food was tasty. I loved the truffle fries. The turkey burger was also very good.  The price is my only concern. It's pretty expensive for burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak eggs and biscuits. The biscuits had a strange sour after taste. My wife ordered the turkey BLT w/truffle fries...nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"One of my and all my friends favorite restaurants in town! So good they have opened a few new locations since it's inception. Based on a half healthy half indulgent menu EVERYTHING is so yummy!!! My all time favorite thing tho is waking up Saturday morning, going on my Instagram and checking out what the weekend \"benny\" special is. This weekend was the \"fettuccine benny\" and it was creamy, yummy, carb loaded delicious-ness.. (everything's better with a poached egg on top) Over the past 2 years I've only seen 3 duplicated and they were the best of the best! This place is a must in your arsenal of local spots but a HUGE yes for weekend brunch! Don't forget their \"Sunday Sundae\" every Sunday different each week special."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere. Awesome for breakfast or brunch  with a selection of happy (i.e pancakes, waffles) or healthy meals. I had the chicawafadopolis, which was fried chicken tenders with buttermilk pancakes. The meal was delicious with the right portion size."}
{"text":"Cute spot.  I went around 3pm on a weekday and the place was pretty full. I like the fat that they have a healthy vs. fatty menu. I'd say the price points are a bit higher than usual, bit I think it's justified.  The food items are fun and trendy, worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I am OBSESSED with this place. It is so amazing. I recently changed the way I've been eating and this place has been fantastic for my healthier eating habits. The menu is amazing with the healthy/happy sides. I always pick the healthy side. The service is almost always fantastic. I've been coming here twice a week for the past month and the food is phenomenal. I haven't had anything I didn't like. The portobello mushrooms are a MUST. So is the Vegwich. It's amazing with the yogurt horseradish. I always try to get the specials. They're always coming up with something amazing every week. Below are photos of a few things I've gotten. I always post about them on Instagram and give them shoutouts. I love bringing people here for the first time. My friends and I have our weekly hangouts here now because it's so good and the service is fantastic as well as the prices."}
{"text":"Tried the TeriyAHI sandwich (430 calories) OMG super good!!!!! Please try this when you go & also order Truffle fries. People are friendly and atmosphere is nice. It is a small seating area, but I love that they provide cucumber lemon water."}
{"text":"Wonderful little restaurant to stop by on our way back home to California. My family got an array of dishes and all satisfied except for one.   The naked chix had good flavors but the brown rice was definitely undercooked. If Chipotle brown rice was a 10, this would this would be a 5.   The applebottom toast had amazing flavors and the toast was very soft. If you like cinnamon, you need to try this  The more cow bowl was like stir fry in my opinion but tasted amazing! My dad really enjoyed it and I thought it had a great combination of flavors  The sweet brown pancakes were you're normal sweet pancakes and it's extremely filling. We had to share it amongst us 4.   Lastly, because my mom lovvesss fries, we had to get the truffle fries. And she LOVED it. Definitely get some because they gave a very shareable portion and what can go wrong with truffles?   Overall, you must come by and try because the service was really sweet and they also have bottomless coffee :D"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to a country fried steak and eggs but wouldn't you know I order for pick up pay wait for 10 minutes and then they inform me their deep fryer is busted haha there's others ways to deep fry things without modern day technology guys. Girls up front are coo"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place by far! Every time we come in everyone is so nice! We always feel welcome. The whole experience feels like a full service restaurant every time! They should really think about full table service to really experience all the great food. There are so many awesome options one cashier can't explain with a long line. Thanks for the welcoming experience!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Super healthy and everything tasted great!  The location is a little bit off the beating path, but worth it!  The fresh fruit juice smoothies are off the hook!"}
{"text":"Really good food, love the skinny side and the fat side ! Always so packed when you come in. But the two times I've been I enjoyed the food they have a secret menu too. And every Sunday they do a different sundae which is cute. I really enjoyed the smoothie I got last time. Can't wait to bring my man here!"}
{"text":"I always say I'm going to try something new.... but I always end up buying my amazing usual ~ AHI TACO-SAN. Still my SkinnyFats fave! I also tried their Liquid Defense drink, and it was pretty good. I am a regular customer, so I will continuously be back!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now. I've tried food from the healthy and happy side of the menu and I've been happy with everything. The food here is delicious. Healthy doesn't mean boring, and SkinnyFATS is the perfect example of that. Everything on their menu is full of flavor. They serve breakfast all day, have giant mimosas and fantastic fries. That's all you need to know. The customer service is great, everyone is friendly and helpful. The only tricky part is the parking. The lot is a little small for how popular this place is."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait for some good food!   This place looks like it is always busy and we can definitely see why after eating here.   We ordered:  Vegetarian wrap supastar Cinutella Vegwich - little dry, need to add the jalapeño ketchup  Piccata piñata taco Adobo hobo taco Veggie burger - little dry, need to add the jalapeño ketchup  Everything was delicious! The staff was super nice. The wait was long for the food, but it was well worth it"}
{"text":"I have been a long time patron of SkinnyFats. But after our visit this morning, I can sadly say that no more.  I ordered for breakfast, as I always do, the Steak Eyes (with my eggs over medium).    When my meal arrived, I was dismayed to see that not only had the eggs not been cooked as ordered (they came over easy), the steak medallions were considerably smaller than they usually are (think a third of the size) and the biscuits had been replaced with what appeared to me to be a cornbread muffin.  I let the staff know, and they informed me that they had just changed the menu and that the new jalapeño cornbread biscuits were now standard.  Fine, I figured, I'm open to trying new things.  But the tiny fillets were a major disappointment.  In any case, I sent my eggs back to be cooked correctly.  I waited five minutes as my companions began eating their meals.  When my food arrived, the eggs were AGAIN cooked over easy despite my explicit request that they be cooked over MEDIUM.  At this point I said \"f*** it, I'm hungry\" and ate it anyways.  I was already behind my party and decided to eat it as is.  Needless to say, this visit was deeply disappointing for a few reasons.  First of all, the recent \"menu change\" clearly translates to much smaller portion sizes (two of my companions, who have also been SkinnyFats fanatics for years, also noticed that their portions were more meager than usual on the sandwiches they ordered).  Secondly, it's clear that there is zero quality control from the kitchen.  The fact that my eggs were screwed up not once, but TWICE, was frustrating to say the least.    At the end of the day, I'm bummed that one of my favorite local eats has let itself go by forgetting the formula of customer service and quality that made me fall in love with it in the first place!  RIP SkinnyFats.  You will be missed."}
{"text":"Saw this place on a BringMe IG post. Since we were in the area, I had to try. The concept is great - both a healthy and less healthy option of he same dish. Location: it's definitely off any main drag, but if you're wanting to get away from strip life, it's great. Parking: not a lot. It's in an industrial area so there's a lot of other businesses that share the same space. It's a tiny place so very limited seating. It's great when there's a line out the door, not so great when everyone wants to sit down and eat. You order at the front and they bring the food out to you (if you can find a seat). Food: great premise, meh execution. Could be what I ordered but this place was nothing to write home about. Pretty bland flavor and relatively small portions to cost. While those with food allergies could navigate, I worry about cross contamination and even just what modifications to make it ok to eat and tasty. All in all I wasn't impressed but love the idea."}
{"text":"Food was great. I wasn't to happy with the slow boat to China .. To dry !! The tu- nuts was great very tasty and refreshing!! Everything on the menu looks great. Can't wait to come back and try something new .."}
{"text":"Amazing concept!!! Delicious food.  Great GF options!  Great variety- healthy options or splurge after a long vegas night options too. Love that it's off the strip. All 10 of us loved it, including our 6 kids!  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a business park, this cute little eatery serves up some pretty good food.  I love the concept of \"skinny\" and \"fatty\" options opposite each other on one menu.  SO CLEVER.  Picked up lunch here straight from the airport.  Co-worker ate a bean burger and enjoyed it. I ordered the STEAKation sandwich with arugula and horseradish.  Was it the best steak sandwich I have ever eaten? NO.  Was it good? Yes, but I will likely try something else on the menu next time - like the turkey sandwich that originally caught my eye.  I was trying to be healthy but ate all of my fries because the house made bottled spicy ketchup was SO GOOD.  And, I don't even like ketchup.   There's just a few tables in a very tight space and the restaurant fills up quickly - so timing is everything here, because let's be honest....no one is sitting outside to eat in the 100+ temps no matter how ice cold the water is.  Worth checking out this place. So cute."}
{"text":"Nice big variety of meals to choose from, both breakfast and lunch and healthy or happy. We went with some tacos, cauliflower rice, steak eyes and chix on broadway, everything was great! Cute salt and pepper shaker as well ;)"}
{"text":"Good selection of food, wonderful customer service. Good place to eat on not a busy day, it's peaceful at their outside seating when they're not packed. But overall a good restaurant"}
{"text":"The best! I'm usually all about the fat menu. But the occasional skinny side will calm the beast. Tried almost everything in the menu. Really. This is my husband's fave restaurant and he likes to try new things, which rocks because that means I get to try new things. I like to stick to what I know is good and will always be good so I'm not disappointed. Anyway, not the case here cos everything is great.  End. With. Cookies!"}
{"text":"We were so glad we found this place on our last day in Vegas! Wow! I really appreciated the humongous billboard sign that helped point the way to where SkinnyFats was located since it is definitely a location a tourist would easily drive past since it's an area for offices and not located anywhere near any other restaurants. We came in around lunch time and line was practically out the door. For our visit we had the Caulifire, Naked Chix, Tomato Cruise, Liquid Defense, Smoke in Bowl, and the Thai Cobb. Each one delicious!! I definitely loved the Caulifire and the Naked Chix. The mango sauce with the chicken was delicious and I appreciated that they served fresh and healthy ingredients. Also, I loved that they served fresh juices and smoothies! The kids also loved the see-thru cups that they served the drinks in and were very entertained by the comments!   SkinnyFats was definitely a great find and a place with a great vibe! Just don't expect to get a seat during lunch time- you may or may not be so lucky :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, clean restaurant, staff is friendly and attentive- we sat outside and were checked on by multiple servers which is highly appreciated. Love the healthy / happy side on the menu. Creative and delicious! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Update to review. Management showed great care and concern to make it right. That speaks well of the business. Therefore, I am updating my feedback to 3 stars. Not every business seems to care but this one did. Like it or not, it speaks well of the business."}
{"text":"I have been to all three SkinnyFATS locations and have enjoyed them all. That being said, this newest location has become my favorite because 1) it's closest to me and 2) it is simply the biggest location with plenty of tables to sit and grind.  Huge portions, uniquely delicious happy or healthy items, and a menu that has plenty to choose from which, come to think of it, always makes it difficult to decide what to eat here.  But that's a good thing...those who have eaten here know what I'm talkin' 'bout!"}
{"text":"Great food,  great service.  Their sign makes it hard to miss.  Small but great ambiance.  Freshly made juices are wonderful. Had the Steak Eyes $11.95. They have breakfast all day.   First time here.  I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love this cute theme lunch spot. No matter what your in the mood for they have something that will satisfy your craving..."}
{"text":"I like a few things about this restaurant. The soda fountain has boylan's soda which is amazing. The idea of having a healthy menu and an indulgent menu is also really cool. I like the reusable cups as well. However, the food just never lives up to the hype. I have given it several tries and always want to like it, but no go. My burger was practically burned even though they take a temperature and I ordered medium. The truffle fries are always pretty chewy and old tasting. I just wish it was as fresh as they make it seem like it will be."}
{"text":"The concept is amazing-you can choose an item from the skinny side of the menu, or something from the fat side of the menu. We were immediately greeted and offered drinks while we stood in line. Love the reusable take home cups!  5 of us squeezed on one table, while the other 2 in our party sat a few tables away. The only thing about this location is the size; the place is quite popular and it's a smallish place. However, that didn't deter us. It just means that they serve taste and quality. Service was fast and friendly. We shall be back!"}
{"text":"The food is terrible here! I don't know why it's so crowded. The eggs taste like they sat out ALL day, the muffin was so hard, I could throw it and break a window, the fries were soggy. I only eat here, because it's near my friend's office and I've never had anything good.  The cookies are ok."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch while we were in town. I had the WTFrench toast and it was amazing! My husband had the nice to Greek you. Flavor was great. The chicken was just warm (maybe it was supposed to be like that?). We also had the sweet potato fries that were excellent. There were plenty of seats available when we came in around 2pm on a Sunday. Definitely will make it back the next time we are in town! Too many yummy choices on the menu!"}
{"text":"Very good food. I had an amazing filet mignon burrito it was so good. Also their chicken and waffles were delicious. Not a lot of seating and you can miss this place trying to find it. However I will be back again."}
{"text":"The name says it all...  Their menu is split down the center. Left side is if you're feeling Healthy and the Right side is if you're feeling Fat lol. But really, the Fat side is still moderately healthy compared to other restaurants. I went with the Fat side of course, and got their Buff Chix bowl which came with buffalo chicken strips and truffle fries. SO GOOD! and so much food!! Portions are pretty big and their food is fresh. I'd probably frequent here if I lived in the area!"}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant with outdoor patio. I really wanted to try everything on the happy side. Will definitely be back to try more. The only thing I didn't enjoy was coffee, which was a little too watery.   More Cow Bowl: good. So much flavor. I just wished it was a little less saucy. My fried rice was drenched in the teriyaki sauce.   Cheese roll: My favorite. Cheesy and spicy.   Cinnatella: Pretty good."}
{"text":"Hands down the service was amazing. Our food came fast, but was missing our daughters orders. Came out they didn't charge me. Our server apologized and went and rushed two kids meals out. I tried to pay and she refused that I do such a thing and apologized for the wait.   The food was delicious. I had tacos wife had buffalo tenders and son had chicken and waffles. Non of the chicken was over cooked, the truffle fries put a smile on my wife's face and I'm sure the pineapple margarita helped with that too. This place was clean, food was good, service amazing and it was family friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I usually like to try places off the Strip and this place caused me to make at least three U-turns during my drive to get here.  When I finally found this place nestled in the middle of a non-descript business center located down the street from the Hustler strip club, I happily jumped out of my rental car and headed inside.  I found the uniqueness of this place appealing.  You can either order unhealthy food or healthy food.  The healthy side also had juice blends to choose from so I was very excited to get a juice with a meal of boneless wings and fries.  Now that's a win win!  The place is quite small inside with barely any seating during a packed lunch hour.  From the looks of it, there were no men working the front counter which as a guy, I'm not complaining...I wish that happened way more often!  Most of them were friendly and working hard pumping out orders to hungry seated diners.  My meal was decent and I enjoyed my juice blend of ginger, orange, lemon, and some other stuff I don't remember.  It's really not that hard to be healthy in Vegas on vacation as long as you know where to go.  If this place sticks around long enough, then I'll make sure to come back here for another healthy/unhealthy combo meal."}
{"text":"Skinnyfats is one of the BEST places I've eaten at since moving to Las Vegas. They have a little bit if everything and it's all good! Last time I ordered the chicken and waffles. I was NOT in any way disappointed. It was so good I didn't want it to end. My husband loves the chicks on Broadway. Next on my list of things to try here are their smoothies. They look so good. I definitely recommend this place to all my friends and bring new ones each time I visit."}
{"text":"Having both healthy and non-healthy options for a business is always a great incentive to broaden customer demographic.  And just like it's name suggests, SkinnyFATS does just that.  I ordered the hot chic salad and it was very good, and at a reasonable price, too!  From the picture shown, the toppings are not mixed in, but cornered off, so mix it the way you want.  The best part was of course the chicken, and next time, I'd definitely just order that -- and without the greens.  Salad could have used more dressing. Take notice!"}
{"text":"You can he as good or as bad as you want in this restaurant.   The cookies are to die for, the healthy choices are delicious and full of flavor. Very budget friendly and the staff is welcoming and accommodating."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time tonight with my husband, and I loved it! I ordered the Classic and it is by far one of the best burgers that I have ever had! The service is great, and the food is fresh and sooo delishious!!! I will definitely be back again for more! I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great place, the cherry popper burger is a must!!! I love that they have two menus in case that you're being conscious about what you're eating or in case that you're having a cheat day! Delicious never the least!"}
{"text":"A great breakfast place off the hectic strip!  I've had this place bookmarked for like forever, but never had the time to go. Finally I had the chance to go with my family for our first breakfast back from a very long trip.  We went on Martin Luther King Jr. Day (Monday) around 10am and they weren't like super busy, but still lots of people. Didn't know that this place would be this small, they only had like 4 tables for 4 people, some more for only 2 people, and then a few seats facing the window. So if you have more than 4 people with you, it may be kind of hard to fit everyone in. The location is rather odd, in the industrial/business area..don't think I've ever seen or been to a restaurant in a building like it.   The idea of a healthy side of the menu and a \"happy\" side was really nice. Plus, they also have a secret menu! The prices are on the ok side contrast to other typical breakfast/brunch places.   So, me and my brother got something off the secret menu: Sunday Sundae and the REDlicious. The rest of us got he Cherry Popper and the Smotherload.  First of all, I actually didn't know what I ordered was a dessert. I found out when the employee asked if they should serve mine with everyone else's or afterwards. I was certain mine was a dessert when I saw the portion of my dish, pretty small. However, it tasted DELISH and the portion was perfect for me, because I was planning on sharing with my mom between two dishes. The Smotherload was also perf, the portion was just enough. Cherry Popper tasted good too and the side of Truffle Fries was amazing!  Overall, I liked it and would come back again :)  (But the rest of my family thought it was just a so-so)"}
{"text":"Great food, clean place, friendly and helpful workers, and good ingredients equal 5 stars. We've eaten dinner and breakfast here and we're happy with both. I would call this place a trendy diner type restaurant."}
{"text":"The menu is crazy!  If you like something different but familiar this is the place for you.  Super hard to find...  it's just in an unmarked multi office building (does throw some charm to it) the staff is awesome.  I like be all the different ketchups.  Thus is definitely a hidden gem.  It isn't cheap but it's not fast food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their chicken and waffles is my favorite on the menu. Only downside to this place is that the dining area is so small. You either end up waiting for awhile for a table or going to go."}
{"text":"Friend took me here for lunch and thought it be a bad idea for me haha. Got the burger and it was awesome ! ! The fries tooooo goooood haha."}
{"text":"Had the UnBRIElievable French Toast on the happy side and it was exactly what they claimed. I still dream of this dish, and I'm not normally a breakfast kind of gal. I look forward to coming back to try more of the menu and their juices as I've only been here once. (Shock! Horror!) Keep up the great work guys."}
{"text":"Service and food was good. I'm giving a 3 star just because the food wasn't as I thought it would be from the reviews given. The truffle fries had no flavor, and the sirarcha ahi tacos were kind of disappointing. I can say I really enjoyed the STEAKation and waffles."}
{"text":"Something for everyone...had merica...wow it was good and the shake was really tasty!!"}
{"text":"Wow - This place was great!!!  Fresh, Cooked to Order, Healthy or Naughty - you can't go wrong.  Only complaint on this particular visit were the under cooked taters.  Otherwise delish, delish, delish.  My wife loved the juice as well but for me it was all about the \"Fats\" breakfast!!!   Don't miss out on this local gem!!!     We will return on our next trip to sin city!!!    D."}
{"text":"Ok someone is going to have to slap some sense into me (metaphorically)  for not indulging in this goodness sooner. Especially since I pass by it each day after work. I know I have had their filet mignon tacos before at an event that was catered by them. Those were amazing but I didn't know what else awaited. I stopped by after leaving work with the hunger beast that needed to be tamed. It was crowded but the line moved quickly. While i scanned the menu I had the lady behind the counter tell me to take  a peak at the secret menu which is in a slideshow format on a tablet. It all looked good , but the buffarito. (buffalo chicken burrito) caught my eye. Ordered that came with a side of fries and .. they make their own soda. Sugar cane soda, which taste way better than the high fructose corn syrup gunk. After a lil wait, I was presented with my mini feast. The burrito was plentiful the wings were crispy the sauce was just tingly enough to give my taste buds a lil burn but not melt them. They also included a side of ranch to dip in, and the fries were amazing not  overly salty or stale or bland but just right. I will gladly stop by again to try their ever changing menu."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed with the food that I got here today. I ordered the rediculous and it was okay but nothing amazing. the worst part of my meal was the side of truffle fries I got. they were soggy and had no flavor at all. to make things worse, the iced tea that I ordered was watered down and I had no flavor at all. my friends agreed with me. they ordered the classic burger with sweet potato fries and the happymess. it was all below average to us and we will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's so tasty and you walk away feeling great. We went on a Saturday for lunch and it was kind of a tight squeeze for how busy it was. It might be best to go during another time/day."}
{"text":"Woooooooooow is all I have to say. I had the Greek dish and my husband had the naked chix and let me tell you we did not speak at all... That's how delicious the dish was. The young man at the cashier really took his time to explain the menu to us since it was our first time. He deserves a raise by the way. Excellent customer service. I will return over and over again..."}
{"text":"Obsessed. Deff on the must-eat-and-go-back-again-and-again list for Vegas.   The good: The menu has a \"happy\" ie delish and calorie filled side and then \"healthy\" still delish options.   The spot is in a random location but really cool inside. Colorful, cool art, nice staff.   Specials! If you follow them on Instagram @eatskinnyfats they have daily specials and a secret menu.  The chicken and waffles on the secret menu is deeeelish.  The Bad: specials run out fast so if you want it get in there!   Great spot. Check it out."}
{"text":"Skinny Fats gives you fresh produce and their sauces are made fresh every morning. You can eat light or you can choose the Fats section of the menu. I go there often. I love it. The employees are great."}
{"text":"Man this place rocked. We wanted something different than the usual buffet crap in Vegas. So we went to yelp! It is a bit off the strip, but well worth the short drive!  Great food - healthy or happy!! Fun menu and great food. Our food was super fast and pretty dang yummy. There was numerous employees around - The manager came and helped us with the menu - explaining how it worked and have us some great ideas for choices. Next time I come I will try some healthy or skinny but this time we ate happy or fat! It was so great! Food was in rich supply and delicious!!  The waiter and other people helping out were fantastic, friendly, interested, and even burned our bacon so it had the crispy flavor that my wife loves!  To be clear, the bacon was cooked fine the first time, my wife just prefers the more crispy bacon! :-)  We left happy and hopefully not too fat! I thought the prices were great for the amount and quality of the food we got.   We will be back! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I had 3 breakfasts in Las Vegas.  I went to highly rated places in yelp and I am leaving 1 review for the best place.  It's skinnyfats.  I love the menu how they separated the menu.  Their coffee is actually very good.   I had chicken steak with waffles and it was awesome.   I will give it a 5 start.  Avocatoast was above average, but Not something that I could crave.   Two eyes were very good, but I strongly recommend the chicken and waffles.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fun restaurant with different options, some unusual like my cauliflower appetizer that had buffalo wing sauce!  Delicious though and also had the risotto balls - incredible!  Friendly staff, overall fun and tasty!"}
{"text":"Sitting here now munching - had to give a shoutout to Zia who was amazing! Friendly, personable, gave us suggestions and samples since we were so indecisive. You only come across great service like this once in awhile. An absolute asset to SkinnyFATS, keep her on board! Thanks Zia!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place ! The food is amazing . The staff is really nice and a great atmosphere. Every entree I have had there has been delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their food!! I never go in disappointed. This is one restaurant you don't wanna miss experincing. (:"}
{"text":"Checked this place out on a Sunday evening time around 530pm. Its was surprisingly crowded. Casual dining type restaurant where you order then take a number to a table to wait for the food.   The food took a little bit to get here and they forgot my beer, I had to ask for it twice. They said they had to change the tap so it took a little bit.   I ordered the Bleu Balsamic salad. Spinach salad with red onions topped with bleu cheese and balsamic dressing. They dont joke around with the bleu cheese for sure! They put a lot of blue cheese crumbs on top. The steak was so good tho!  Turnip tacos were great.. lot of cheese ad the meat was cooked perfectly. Very tender and tasty.   They have cucumber water free of charge by the drink station.   The outside seating area is great with comfy chairs/seating, theres a fireplace for cold nights.   The menu has a variety of healthy and \"happy\" choices, so theres something for everyone.  And they have awesome silverware!!"}
{"text":"Such a delicious brunch today! I wish every restaurant served food this great! I can't wait to eat here again!! Thank you"}
{"text":"Update...management handled my complaints with the postmates delivery well, and I returned back to this location. This time was a much better experience. Perhaps it was just the postmates delivery? Either way...good job skinny fats."}
{"text":"I wanted to see what all the hype was about, and now I know! I love this place! Their food is absolutely delicious. I had the Berry Strong, and it was heavenly. The wait time for the food was short, only around 10-15 minutes! Great service as well. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots, I feel bad that I just now have the time to write them a review. Or have I before? Can't remember, oh well the more the better right? Everything here from the location, to the food, to the way they decorated the place, and the servers. Everything is ON POINTTTTTTTT!!! My all time favorite is the Teriyahi. I LOVE LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"Truly one of my favorite spots. The staff is friendly the food is great. I've been to two different locations and both have amazing art on the walls. From the restaurant interior to the restroom doors. The food is always good.  I love their simple kids menu. My favorite here is the sweet cheese us. Their fountain drinks are the best. Love their mint ice tea and their ginger ale. They even have cucumber or different infused water. The menu has a healthy side and happy side but honesty  both sides make me happy."}
{"text":"The young lady at the front was just as sweet as pie. Thank you for being patient and giving me some \"secret menu\" advice. The food was good and wonderfully fresh. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because it's a tight fit and not much of an outdoor area to retreat to."}
{"text":"Definitely be back and refer to others too. Mac and cheese lovers, this is something you should try. The morning mac is great. A huge portion that can be shared with eggs, bacon, sausage, cheese...I really liked it. The other plate we got was the Wrap superstar. It had a very delicious green sauce, slightly spicy with avocado taste. Tasted really good. A constructive comment, the tortilla wrap was really rubbery. Explore another type of wrap or grill the wrap after wrapping for a crunchier shell. The workers were friendly and food was ready fast but as everyone says, the place is small. Maybe they will consider enlarging or opening another location closer to the strip. We also ordered the ginger juice and it was to die for."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat in Vegas! You seriously can't go wrong with the options (they have a happy menu and healthy menu) and even the healthy side is pretty delicious, although I generally opt for the happy side! Their truffle fries are great, and I really love their skinny fat punch. They do have a pretty long line during typical lunch and dinner hours, so there may be a bit of a wait. Also, there isn't a lot of seating room."}
{"text":"Pretty sure it's not the best in town but it's good. You walk in and it's like your total hip breakfast cafe vibe. We ordered a to go order and the employees at the front were really nice and welcoming. The food was good too. I guess there's like all this hype for the restaurant but I just didn't really get it. Kind of pricey for casual breakfast food in a casual small cafe restaurant. I'll grab breakfast here again for sure but not if I'm in hurry. It took about 30 minutes for our to go order and there was about five people dining in and one person ahead of us for to go."}
{"text":"Excellent décor and really liked the Healthy and Happy sides to choose. They got busy and forgot our drinks but it happens. I had the Smother'load and it sounds great but could have had more smother. The burrito concoction was somewhat dry and lacked full flavor (Salt is crucial as Fiona would say). But all in all a great place to have a hangover breakfast off the strip."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is FUN!  Greeted once you walk to the register.  I went there on a Friday and i heard it usually gets packed   Warning: -not many seating placements    (so get there as early as you can on weekends)  DRINKS WITH FREE REFILLS YAY!  I ordered:  Ahi tuna with the puffed shell Chicken and Waffles Truffle Fries  Service is great. Healthy food or Unhealthy food choices but my ITS SO YUMMY.  no regrets :)"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying, I love Skinny Fats. It is definitely one of those places you have to visit before you truly understand the high reviews this place receives. My mother raved about this place for months before I made it in for the first time. The quality of the food is outstanding and each menu item is unique.   I would give this place 5 stars but there was this one incident...  I was waiting for my to-go food and happened to overhear an order taking place. One customer asked the employee what \"GF\" meant on the menu. The employee told the customer that it meant Gluten Free. But the real kicker was when the customer asked what gluten free was, the employee had NO idea.  I'll admit that I did stand there chuckling at first, later I realized how embarrassing this really was. I almost jumped in and answered for her, but I saved her the embarrassment and let the customer order it anyways.  Granted, gluten free is not as common as lets say, sugar free. Employees should still know what the menu items are/mean.   Other than that, I recommend this place to everyone. For all of you yelp readers out there, here are a few general tips that I wish I knew from the start..  Tip #1: If you are ordering the sandwiches, eat there. Taking them to-go is not the best idea. The bread can be soggy, but nonetheless the food is still enjoyable.   Tip #2: At least half the time your side should be the Slaw Chee. Absolutely fantastic.   Tip #3: If you are ordering to-go, call and find out what the specials are. There are plenty of items that are not on the general menu that are available to order.   Tip #4: If you do order to-go, you can skip the line of people waiting to order. This line can be very unappealing and somewhat frustrating as you stand there and listen to all the little questions each customer has. Simply walk up to the front and say you have an order to go. I was told to do this, so I assume it is a common understanding among the employees and customers."}
{"text":"This place is cool. I wish it was I'm a bigger location it's way too crowed here. So the concept here is simple one side if the menu is healthy one side isn't. I ate of the skinny and it was so good. I had the fruit waffle with the juice based maple syrup. It was so good the waffle was fluffy but tasty. It's wasn't too sweet just right orange sweetness. It came with a turkey bacon which was a thick cut and was really tasty. It reminded me of a bacon/sausage mix. The coffee was basic cafe coffee but really good. The service was different you go to the counter and offer and then you sit down at a table and the foods was brought out to you. Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by locals and I was not disappointed. This restaurant specializes in both healthy and happy options, hence the name SkinnyFATS! Of course my boyfriend and I chose from the happy options. I ordered from the secret menu which are the small TVs against the wall in line. I forget the name but I went with a fried chicken sandwich and fries and my boyfriend got the chicken and waffles.   The staff was absolutely amazing! Extremely kind and helpful and genuinely looked happy to be there, which is rare customer service to find nowadays.   Our food was amazing and exceeded out expectations. For the first time ever my sandwich looked exactly like the photos advertised. I was truly impressed. It had a lot of flavor and the spice was just right. There was fried pickles and coleslaw inside as well. My boyfriend enjoyed his chicken and waffles. The waffles were delicious!   I'm glad I came here and next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend wanted to check this place. A little hole in the wall but as soon as you walk you're intrigued by the art on the wall and good music playing. The menu is full of choices from happy food and healthy food. We ordered their cheeseburgers and have to say it was the most delicious burger I've eaten. A cool place to eat, the vibe is right and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  We ordered a few items among a few friends; shared plates to try each items and I have to say, it's all good."}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced. Love that there are healthier options if you're looking to cut calories, dairy, and or gluten. They also have a secret menu, which has one I my faves, chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"The food is great, no complaints on taste, price. The very small inside and hardly any tables sucks! I've been to the warm springs location many times, thought I would try the dean Martin location, never again! I didn't want to be so rude and cut throat to get a table! Warm springs has plenty of tables and you aren't on top of the customers when ordering at the counter.  You guys definitely need to improve the seating. Maybe get a list for people to get the next table, not the person that's 20 people behind you to hold up a table!"}
{"text":"This what yelp is all about. Taking my ass to the front of an industrial park on the way out of town to the airport to find a place like this. Best f'n tuna taco I have ever had in my life. It was packed, kinda slow, but everyone was friendly and it was totally worth the wait. Had a turkey BLT with sweet potato fries too that was fantastic. Go there. You won't be disappointed. It rocks."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was very hungry. I ordered the Pimp Shrimp aaaannnddd the Balls 2.0. Both were tasty. I was a little disappointed with the Pimp Shrimp, it listed them as Shrimp Tempura, however the batter is a bit thick on the shrimp and not light and airy light tempura should be. A little spicy too, but tasty. The Balls 2.0 was a taste of heaven. Kelly, who took my order described them as creamy rice balls of love and she was RIGHT. Craving them now as I write about them. I love the uniqueness of their menu and looking forward to trying something new on my next visit. They serve \"natural\" sodas, which I'm not sure if its a healthier option or just made to make you think they might be. Not a fan, but there is also tea and good ol water. Food is delicious, atmosphere is nice and service was great!"}
{"text":"We always eat here and I love that they have such a large variety in their menu! So glad they opened another location , and on our side of town too!"}
{"text":"So, my husband and I found this place based on yelp reviews. And let me tell you we were not disappointed. We ate there twice during our vegas stay within 24 hours. Once for breakfast and once for lunch.   Everything was fresh and delicious. The prices are a little high but that would not stop us from eating there again!"}
{"text":"Really glad I decided last minute to come to this place! Love the food here. First off, the location is a bit tricky as it is part of a large business complex. Luckily they have a huge billboard sign pointing down to where it is when I drove by it. The outside of the building itself is very unassuming as there are no signs and can easily be missed if you aren't looking. The place is fairly small and consists of maybe 8-10 tables with some counter seating as well. You order food at the counter, they give you a number, and find a spot to sit and they bring the food to you once ready.  Chix on Broadway with side of truffle fries - 4/5 - BLT with a huge piece of fried chicken with a lemon aioli on a brioche bun - love this sandwich as it was full of flavor and the crunch from the bacon and especially the chicken was amazing. The truffle fries  Ahi Taco San Taco - 4/5 -  huge piece of fried Ahi with their special slaw, pico, and sauce - can be a bit messy but delicious! Turnip Taco - 5/5 - filet mignon with pico and their habanero lime cream sauce - has a pretty decent kick that lingers - my favorite taco out of the two I tried, definitely must-try Salted Caramel Cookie - 5/5 - amazing cookie! Loved this so much and wish I had bought more. It's not overly sweet and has the perfect chewiness with a slight crunch I think a cookie should have. Highly recommend their cookies!  They also make their own sodas using sugar cane which was really tasty. Not super carbonated and had their own unique flavor which I enjoyed very much. Also the strawberry lemonade is amazing! My go to drink every time I come here now. Overall, I enjoyed everything I tried here and didn't feel disgusting after eating so that's always a plus!"}
{"text":"Had this for the first time last night while I was in town for work.  Such a great concept-- \"skinny\" items for those being more health conscious and \"fat\" for those that aren't too concerned and want a great meal.  Great place to enjoy with friends since it's customizable to everyone.  I had the Turkey BLT - OMG out of this world. It was a \"skinny\" that tasted like a \"fat\" item ...it was that good. Not going to lie I was a little concerned that a skinny item could taste so good.  Check it out on your next visit here."}
{"text":"The concept of this place is a dream to me! To be able to find various healthy menu items while my family is still able to indulge. The struggle of staying healthy is real! We came on a Monday at 2PM. I figured it would be slow but boy were we wrong. There were no tables at the time, and the line was wrapped around the bar (which seems to be common) but people ate quickly and cleared out so we were able to grab a 4 top. From the photos of the food, I had no idea it was an order at the counter sort of place, but probably wonderful for the many people who made to-go orders that work nearby.   After reviewing their menu and it being (unfortunately) too late to eat breakfast, I opted for the slow boat to China and sriricha ahi taco. My husband got the cherry popper burger with truffle fries and ordered the veg-to-bowl and yummus for the kids. They have a children's menu which was very disappointing... I get that in America, we're used to shoving garbage down our kids throat and pray they don't get type II diabetes by the time they're 25, but come on. At a place like this, I was hoping for a healthier kids menu than chicken fingers, peanut butter and jelly, & PB & banana.   The food arrived not too long after and we dug in. The kids LOVED the yummus with pita. I was really surprised how much they liked it since the rosemary was so potent in it that it turned off my husband. They also really enjoyed the vegetable bowl with tofu and a plethora of veggies. The portobello fried rice was dreamy. Definite thumbs up for the veg-to-bowl even though it's on the happy side. My husband really enjoyed his burger, but had the exact same complaints as Jade. He picked it up, took a bite, and told me that he is scared to put the thing down because it will definitely fall apart next time he picks it up. His plate looked like a plate of soup by the time he was done and said he would ask them to toast the bun more next time and apply less sauce.   My sriricha ahi taco and slow boat were alright. I think they use too much sauce here with their aiolis being at the front of the menu. There was definitely too much aioli and sauce in general on my slow boat.  I could barely taste the ingredients. The tuna in my ahi taco were mediocre at best with them being rubbery along with the tortilla. The slawchee in it was delicious and the flavors in the taco were great. I just wish the tuna was less rubbery. Overall, I was a bit disappointed with the results. While we are indeed sauce lovers, we will have to ask for less sauce on everything next time so we can really taste the ingredients."}
{"text":"Like the options for a healthy lunch. The location is odd but it's Vegas and that seems to be the norm. Great off the beaten path place to eat."}
{"text":"I have been here 3-4 times, and food and service have always been pretty amazing. However, I came in here Saturday around 1pm with one of my friends, and encountered very rude service from the cashier at the front. By rude, I mean that she was rolling her eyes at my friend and I, and talking to her co-workers while we were placing our orders, which resulted in us having to repeat our order (she didn't apologize or say excuse me). This female cashier displayed an impatient stare the entire time.   I am a registered nurse, so I know what working in the customer service industry is like. I expect some level of respect when dining at an establishment. Hope the management does something about this."}
{"text":"The first time I reviewed this place, I gave it a 5 star. I am changing up my review a little and lowering it to 4 stars as in the recent times I have been there, I have realized this place is not worth a perfect rating.  The food here is really good. I have yet to have a bad meal or regret when ordering off the menu. My boss absolutely loves this place as he eats here about 2-3 times a week.  The prices here are more than they should be. I could get 2 burritos at my favorite Chipotle for the price of one meal here.  And I am unsure how healthy the healthy side is.  Besides that, the workers here are great. This place is always busy and they move quick to serve all of them.  Try this place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Real friendly service.  Had brunch here.  Ordered  Sweet potato pancakes (2/5)  would not order again. Chicken and waffles (4/5) chicken tenders not chicken on the bone.  i'd prefer chicken on the bone. S'motherload (breakfast burrito) (4/5) very tasty Steak eyes (like country fried steak) (4/5) pretty tasty.  Very small restaurant.  Counter service.  But they were pretty accommodating for our party of 8.  They put some tables together for us.  Especially the one female with dark hair.  she was really great.  I'd say the taste is a cross between a good chain restaurant and hash house a go-go.  They seem to have unique recipes but the quality isn't on par with Eat (downtown)."}
{"text":"Kicked out the old Cici's Pizza and put in a SkinnyFATS...Yes!  Been to several of the SkinnyFATS locs and I have not had anything I did not like except the american fries for breakfast and even those were tasty.  I had the Cherry Popper burger this visit.  A big 1/2 lb beef burger topped with a fried egg, sweet and spicy slaw and chopped cherry and banana pepper  served on a Hawaiian sweet roll.  Very tasty flavors and just enough heat but not overpowering.  The beef patty came out a perfect medium temp and was very flavorful.  They should serve this burger with wetnaps because it sure is messy.    I also had to try the Spicy Latina soup. Yum! like a chicken tortilla soup with chunks of onion, jalapeno's, and chicken in a creamy tomato broth with large thick crispy strips of tortilla.  This dish is very spicy so be careful or you might get burned.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Omg! I absolutely love this place! From their great customer service to their food, everything was great and delicious! Jay was such a wonderful, friendly, and helpful girl! She definitely made our visit worth while!   We ordered the following:  Berry waffle: delicious!!! From the waffles to the syrup, it was so delicious I forgot to take pictures of the food I ordered! The syrup is runny, but the taste was awesome! I'm a huge fan of turkey bacon so it was a plus that the waffles came with 2 pieces of turkey bacon!   Balls: delicious! Fried risotto balls was Amaze-balls! It was fried to perfection!   Fried pickles: I'm a big fan of fried pickles and these fried pickles were crunchy and the batter actually  stayed on!   Latina soup : it had a kick to it! Do not get if you can't eat spicy! It was good though!   The drinks were amazing too! Got a birch beer, great treat, and one of their punch without bananas!   Overall the food was great and the service and people are great here! I would definitely be back! Thanks Jay for our great first time experience here!"}
{"text":"I LOVE skinnyfats. With a hectic schedule I let ordering take out really take a toll on my health. I have been looking for healthier options when grabbing a quick bite. Cannot go wrong here. The service is IMPECCABLE and food is Delish! A little tip-if you're in a time crunch, just call in your order for pickup. I typically always do this and I never have to wait in a long line once I get there."}
{"text":"If Skinnyfats doesn't put a smile on your face then I'll have to call you Scrooge.  From the restaurant space to the server ware, there is a meticulous attention to detail that achieves the perfect balance of trying (but not too hard) to please you.  The restaurant space is tiny, so be prepared to wait during rush hours, but what they did to that cookie cutter commercial place, and the menu, and little things like the salt and pepper man turns my heart into a fuzzy kaleidoscope hippie.    Flaxseed Fans or Rebels can choose items from either their \"Skinny\" menu or their \"Happy\" menu (I'm really pleased they didn't call that Fat.  We are not fat.  We are big boned and Happy, thank you very much).  These are your typical diner menu items served with a modern twist, alongside fancy, healthy fusion grub.  There's something to please everyone.  Hubby had the Eggs Benedict burger which he was happy with.  Lil man had the Buf Chix (sauce on the side) and a fruit bowl which was pretty standard.  And I had the Cobb Salad because I was nursing a hangover.  Good stuff.  Totally can relate to the sad face on the happy meter when our root beer floats were almost empty.    Service at the counter was pretty slow (dunno if the crew is new), but they were extremely accommodating.  Re-did my son's order when I expressed that I wish the sauce was on the side.  If you're looking for breakfast with good vibes and some inspiration, go here folks!!!  So happy they finally opened on Sundays.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place from every angle!!! You may be intimidated by the long line and small seating area....do not worry!!! Somehow by the time you get to the front (which does not take long at all) there WILL be a place for you to sit and enjoy your awesome meal. I've had about 15 things on the menu and they are all great! I love the ahi taco and steakation on the healthy side. And the chix over Broadway, cherry popper and Tu-nuts are BOMB! Friendly staff+clean area+fast service+amazing food ideas=repeat customers.   Oh...and good call with the jalapeño ketchup!"}
{"text":"More Cow Bowl: so good...steak, peppers, onions, brown rice, portobello mushrooms......will definitely eat there again. So much to choose from"}
{"text":"Very very interesting concept. Half the menu is on the \"healthy side\" and the other half is on the \"i don't care about eating healthy today\" side. I like, I like.  I ordered the Ahi Tacos, which came with 3, and it was pretty good. HOWEVER....if you're not a big fan of eating raw stuff or the TEXTURE of it, considered yourself warning.  Don't get me wrong, these tacos were DELICIOUS....but I can only handle so much raw texture in my mouth =/ After one and a half tacos, the slimy feeling became too much for me to handle. I'm not big on sushi anyways so this was like going out of my element. I was still able to finish all three of my tacos though so that's really saying how delicious they were.  I really appreciated and enjoyed the fruit/vegetable infused iced water.   Skinnyfats is located in a weird warehouse/business area. It IS easy to miss if you're not paying attention. I have still yet to try their burgers so I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came in for the first time and the service was great and the food was even greater. I ordered the Cherry Popper, which is what the cashier recommended to me. Definitely an experience to remember. The server brought out the food and made sure to tell us which dish was which told us to enjoy. After we got a couple bites in the cashier came to check how our food was tasting and if we needed anything and also made sure we knew her name even though she had a name tag on. Keep up the amazing work and thank Jennifer for us. My wife and I loved this and hope our next visit is as great as our last."}
{"text":"The drive out of town coincided perfectly with the opening hours of this place! (look for the huge Smiley Face billboard) Pulled into the lot just as they were opening the doors, Hooray!! The menu is clever, the staff was fun. I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Have been waiting for a opportunity to eat jere, I have heard so many good things about their food. I was not disappointed at all. My husband had the tacos and I had the breakfast burrito. The food was very fresh, the flavors were amazing and the staff was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"In the dessert of Las Vegas we felt famished for healthy food. We've watched enough food documentaries on Netflix to scare the s- out of us making it hard to stomach sugar, salt, GMOs, and a everything else that is said to give us cancer. It just doesn't taste right anymore. What can I say? Fear does something to your taste buds.  So out of desperation we paid over $10 for a cab to take us three miles to SkinnyFats. And the cab driver questioned us. He pulled up to a nondescript strip on the side of the highway. It looked like a row of offices - maybe even call centers. He was like, \"Are you sure this is it?\" He even went in with us and took a menu to make sure it was a legit restaurant! On our second trip (because we sure went back) the cab driver gave us his cell number so that we could have a ride back. No taxis were going by that joint. SkinnyFATS was for locals with cars and not tourists like us.  Both times we went we got freshly pressed juice in reusable cups. YUM. It was like home and we loved it after the sodium-saturated, MSG ridden stuff we'd been suckered into eating with our friends.  The food was scrumptious. The menu is divided into two sections. First, the skinny. That's all about healthy food. The other part is the fat which isn't quite as healthy. So, you can have chicken and waffles with a grilled chicken breast or chicken and waffles with fried chicken. Get it? Brilliant.  Heck! We loved SkinnyFATS so much that plan to incorporate it into our next trip. We're going to the Grand Canyon and have to fly into Vegas. We were thrilled to realize that we could go to SkinnyFATS before our three hour drive to the canyon and then again when we come back! I'll cheers to that!"}
{"text":"Just ate here and cannot rave about the food enough. The healthy choices don't skip out on flavor. Had the smotherload burrito and it was freaking amazing. I'm not a big cheese person, so I had the cheese put on the side. To my surprise, it was also amazing. So much I ended up putting it over the entire burrito. The ingredients were fresh, the steak inside the burrito was cooked perfectly. Also had the healthy berry protein waffles. Again. Amazing. Orange juice tasted like I bit into the orange myself. Honestly new favorite spot for sure! The people that work here are extremely friendly and informative of the menu for newbies like myself and I had a lot of questions. Plenty of dine in space and a patio. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Good concept but not if you are getting to go food in a hurry. Took 45mins for me and another custumer to get our togo food. Both called 15 to 20mins before we got there and then had to wait 30 35mins inside! Its togo for a reason so you dont have to wait. I was late somewhere and so was the other custumer but having already paid, all I could do is wait. The other custumer got really upset and kept asking about her order as I sat and waited and waited. Aparently dine in custumers got their food before togo custumers and had a higher priority?! What, come on now. I was excited about the food but after the wait some parts came out cold and not even looking good. Like the red velvet waffle looks so nice on the pix, but togo it was a mess in a pizza box that I had to spend another 5mins arranging for myself. The other food items were pretty mediocre and overpriced. Portions are a big size however. The juice was cold pressed and they were not sure how to explain that it wasnt really fresh squeezed, but still 9$. Paid almost 50$ for the food(being cold and bad presentation) and really disappointed with the wait time, price and quality overall. I guess they charge for the packaging and atmosphere, because their place is kind of hard to find too. I'll only give it another try if I was to eat there and not order to go. It's too bad because I was excited about this place and had it bookmarked for a while."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it one more star because yesterday my friends and I went in and I put two tables together. When we left I separated them and the girl kept thanking me and had a huge smile on her face. She looked so happy because we set it up the way it was. It meant a lot that me helping her out make her that thankful. I appreciated that as much as she appreciated me doing it!"}
{"text":"Hot mess nachos!!! Changed my life lol so much better than I expected. Must try in Vegas especially if you're buffet burnt out. This is good food. Note the Hawaiian bun definitely adds a sweetness to any burger. It through me off when I ordered the cherry popper. Still delicious and I can respect where they were going with it ...just not my taste. I would prefer a plain bun. But I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Always great food and interesting recipe combinations to add loads of flavor to your mouth.  I like this location better that the Dean Martin because you can actually sit down with out having to wait for someone to finish their meal and then you pounce on a table like its they prey of a mountain lion.  I had the Wake N Bacon sammie which is topped with fried egg, thick cut applewood bacon, avocado pepper jack cheese and sirracha mayo.  Yum!  just enough heat for your taste buds to keep it interesting.  I had the country potatoes with this one and they were just ok.  They tasted like they had been sitting in a warming pan because of the mushy texture and lacking crunchiness.  We also had the Mean Bean which is a spicy black bean veggie burger heaped with half a sliced avocado to cool down the temp.  Good balance in this dish also.  We had the Truffle fries with this entree which are always a fan favorite.    Either way I will be back to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"Decided to give something different a try for my birthday meal.  I am glad Skinnny Fats was the top pick.  The location is in a very odd industrial area that many people would overlook if they did not know this great restaurant existed here.  The space itself is very tiny and has seating for 40 people tops so it always feels busy inside.   The menu has a Jekyll and Hyde feel to because you have some items that appear very healthy and some that appear gluttonous.  No worries I will pick the latter every time.    I selected the \"Chix on Broadway\" with Truffle Fries.  This crispy fried chicken breast sandwich was a great portion.  I had to ask for some more lemon aioli to slather on but the crispy lettuce, tomato and bacon were the perfect topping trifecta.  My fires were a little under done but were still delicious.    The \"Unbrierevable\" was another item selected that did not disappoint the taste buds.  The combination of strawberries, chocolate sauce, tender melted brie cheese and a crispy waffle were amazing.  The french inspired dish of gluttony definitely satisfied the taste buds.   The one downfall about the location is the size.  I am sure that is why the Warm Spring's location is triple the size and has an outdoor patio.  We will be back when we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here on my visit to Vegas. My boyfriend and I were looking on Yelp and found this place! It looked great and I'm a sucker for visuals so the photos did it for me and I do not regret coming here at all! I think the concept of the restaurant is absolutely amazing! They have a health conscious side and a not so healthy side but everything sounds amazing because they have such a great selection and kind of a twist to some things. The names of their plates are super fun and give off a great vibe! The inside of the restaurant is such a creative design! The staff was very friendly and informative about their menu so making a choice wasn't hard! But the options keep you thinking.   I live in LA and I always think about going here! PLEASE COME TO LA."}
{"text":"After a few visits, I think I'm in a serious relationship with this place.  The atmosphere is cool, the menu contains more than enough options, and regardless of which side of the menu you order off of (Happy or Healthy), you're going to be stuffed (or leave with a to-go box).  Speaking of the menu, be warned: even if you order off the healthy side, you're going to feel guilty because of how good everything tastes, and probably because of how much you'll end up eating.   Here are a few of my favorites:  try the \"S'motherload\" burrito (Happy side), the\"Sweet Cheese Us\" (Happy side) and the \"Caulifire\" (Healthy side).  They have a nice selection of juices, smoothies and shakes on the menu, but I've always grabbed a soda from the fountain.  By the way, the cups for the fountain drinks are sturdy plastic cups.  You can toss them in the recycle bin when you're done, or take them home.  Skinny Fats even lets you know they're dishwasher safe.  So if you have a need for plastic cups at home, these are keepers.  A few other suggests of information:  for those who want breakfast during non-breakfast hours, they serve breakfast all day.  They also offer a military discount.  When you come in and head to the counter to order, take notice of the display that's about chest level along the wall.  It scrolls specials across the screen for you to consider.  It's definitely worth taking a look to see what's featured there.  This location is in a storefront with lots of parking.  You can strut toward the restaurant with great satisfaction since others in the parking lot will see you headed toward deliciousness, and you can quietly laugh at the people who aren't going to eat what you're about to eat.  I've only been to the Decatur location, but there are three others around town.  I'll try more of them eventually, but trust they're all equally good.  Find the one nearest to you and bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food, style, ambiance and charm. But especially the food. Restaurants like this soar on the food, above all else and they really nail presentation, quality, and taste. I will definitely be back.  My only gripe is the location and the speed. It's located way off the beaten path. I would also highly reccomend getting a second register or maybe a greeter to help explain the menu (as it's long) so that it will speed up the order taking process."}
{"text":"Today I ordered lunch for my office from this location. It was AMAZING! This is my second time eating from here and I've been impressed both times. The portions are a great size, and so so delicious. They have so many wonderful flavor combinations in the dishes I've tried. Today I ordered the Ahi Sirachi. It was really good. It was on the healthy side of the menu, but I couldn't even tell. ;) it was really yummy and I will definitely order it again. I can't speak for everyone in my office, but I love this place & I will definitely come back again soon."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to places when visiting Las Vegas. Great food on both sides of the \"Healthy\" and \"Happy\" menu. I'm a fan of the Happy side menu though and if you're coming to Vegas it's a must have."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously priced for mediocre food. I was not impressed and have no intentions of going back. I don't remember the name of what I ordered but it was a cucumber sliced with crap on it and $11 later I went to the sonics behind it since I was starving!"}
{"text":"I had the best experience at Skinnyfats. I've never been here before. I eat a very clean diet, so it's often challenging to eat out. Cayla took my order and Collin answered any specific questions I had about the menu. (He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu.) There was absolutely no problem substituting items or making changes to meet my needs. I often feel bad asking, but Cayla & Collin acted like it was no big deal at all, which was very nice. I ordered the bean burger, and I substituted the bean patty for a turkey patty, and got the lettuce wrap instead of a bun, with sweet potato fries. My guy, who does not eat healthy, had a cherry popper burger and Snicker- doodle cookies. My order was to go. When I got home, our order was exactly how I ordered, and it was delicious!!! We both enjoyed our dinner so much, that we went back the following night to try the breakfasts for dinner. Again, my order needed to have substitutions, and it was no problem at all. My guy had the Cowboy Killer Benedict. Again, both our breakfasts were delicious! We ate in this time, and Collin came by to ask how everything was, and asked about our previous night's dinner as well. We will definitely be back. We FINALLY found a place that can accommodate my clean eating AND also serves delicious goodness for my guy!"}
{"text":"This is for their dean martin location.  Been here quite a few times.  The concept behind SkinnyFats is that they offer a menu of both things that could be considered healthy (skinny)  or happy (fat)... or both!    This location is quite small with limited seating though and because of the popularity of this place, it's almost always packed.   However, once seated, the food is delicious, and many of my friends I've brought here all agree.  Just a few suggestions of foods, there's so much good stuff to try:  Tu-Nuts is to-die-for.   Spicy ahi tuna & sriracha slaw in a cucumber boat w/almonds, teriyaki, avocado & sriracha aioli.  So refreshing and delicious yet you don't feel like you ate too much.    REDiculous - Red velvet waffle, cream cheese frosting, berries & chocolate w/ applewood bacon - This is for those that just love dessert (who doesn't?)  Berry the Steak - Flatbread w/shaved NY strip, feta, goat cheese, arugula, blackberries & balsamic.  The variety of food here is so vast.  There's something for everyone.   There has really been nothing I've ordered that wasn't really good.  Come with a few people and try and share a few things!  I guarantee it that you'll love all their offerings.  Tip:  On Sundays, they offer their always different Sunday Sundae.   Just look at the photos here on Yelp.  They are crazy, in a good way!  Tip #2:  The Jalapeno ketchup is SOOO Good."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious, healthy, and safe. There's a variety of yummy not-so-healthy options for the non-health concerned to enjoy also. They also work with adjusting meals, as long as it's not an extreme change (I had a breakfast wrap turned into a Lettus wrap/boat). All items are available throughout the day.  The staff was very professional, welcoming, fun, and considerate. The place is clean, comfortable, and feels spacious/open. I am so excited to return there again!!"}
{"text":"Total hipster vibes here! Reminds me of the hipster hole in the walls back in Cali! Super Small location and in an industrial plaza which I think is a very weird place for restaurant, but super dope menu options. I got the chicken and waffles and it was really good, however the chicken did lack a bit of seasoning. They've got stuff for everyone on their menu from vegans to hard core meat eaters. Very diverse! Just don't come at lunch time because they are packed!  I love that they have old-school cherry soda and strangely enough I really like their drink cups if that's even a thing! Oh and they sell a variety of different ketchup Branded by them! Some of them are very interesting be careful because they pour out of the container! Overall pretty good experience just don't come at a peak time."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is amazing! I always lean towards the happy side of the menu and ive never been dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding! Whoever created this menu/concept is a genius. Staff is friendly & attentive. I just can't give it 5 stars because of the service. If you order a lemonade (or Arnold Palmer) be prepared to get it AFTER you get your food & you'll have to ask for it... Fries are cold if you come in & they aren't busy but the main dishes they have to prepare are amazing. Great food & I'll be back... just not as often as I would like."}
{"text":"Service was great. Their menu sounds delicious but food was horrible. I ordered the zucc pasta which is zucchini pasta with marinara and veggies. Added a filet mignon for protein and ended up spending $19. I wanted medium rare and got well done. Not worth it. Worst part is, ended up getting food poisoning. Like I said, great service but my one and probably only time, I get sick. I'm not going to say stay away from this place because their are other stuff on the menu that sound good, I'm just not going to suggest the zucc pasta."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place!!!! they have a wide selection of healthy and non healthy choices. Keep in mind get there early on weekends as there could be a wait for a table, it moves pretty quick but there will be a wait. Staff are very friendly and prompt!   All dishes are very delicious!!!! There is something for everyone on the menu!   A definitely must try and check out!!!! Cant wait for their Henderson location to open!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is yummy awesome! Great menu from healthy to all out delicious and everything in between. Clean fresh atmosphere with good food presentation. The customer service was the best I've had in a long time, Kathryn was super nice and happy to explain the menu. I will definitely come back to this location when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Hard to find.  Very eclectic menu.  Tasty food and ok value. It seemed a little pricey for what you get, but the menu is so interesting that it's worth a stop to try something fun and outrageous.  I had a smoothie that was rich in kale and other good stuff along with a breakfast of tasty morsels which included pieces of filet mignon.  The reviews are accurate when reading others. It is pretty much what I've read at Yelp.  I would definitely return. If prices were 10%-20% less I'd give it 5*"}
{"text":"Yet another five star review of this place! I have to yelp about the food and service.   Excellent!    My eldest sister, who seems to know all the right places to eat and where to go  in her hometown, tells me that we are having lunch at SkinnyFats. I roll my eyes because I incorrectly conjure up in my mind a so-hip it hurts trendy spot where the food is terrible and the service is awful. Boy, was I wrong.   The food is EXCELLENT. I've been here twice now, and man, the food is EXCELLENT!  Coffee is strong. The small space and décor... cool. Service is Xtra friendly.  And,the food is EXCELLENT!   Be prepared to wait.    The place can get very busy.   So far, my favorite is the seared teriyaki tuna sandwich. Tender  tuna, greens with citrus sauce, fresh tomato slices & spinach, perfectly held together on toasted sesame-grain toast. EXCELLENT! The fries are good too.    Absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"So many choices, it was a bit overwhelming. But, now I'll have to come back and try more. I had the Nice to Greek You flatbread, which hit the spot for a light lunch. The Green Mile juice was refreshing, for sure a good choice if you want a clean bev."}
{"text":"After a long day on the strip and heading back to state line , me and the hubby wanted some good food, but with-out the crowdedness of the strip! Ended up yelping and stumbled across Skinny Fats and I'm so glad we did.  The place is small, but extremely welcoming. The host/cashier made awesome recommendations and even mentioned some things off their \"secret\" menu! I got the chicken parm from the secret menu and my husband got the cherry popper ... the chicken parm was one of the best I had and even though the cherry popper was spicy, my husband gobbled it down. The fries were delish and the Black Cherry Coke was the BEST I've had! We will def come back when visiting Vegas again! This place is a gem!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. Vibe in there was hip and cool. Definitely impressed enough to want to go back. Why the three stars you ask? The coffee was terrible. The chai latte was terrible. Other than this it was amazing."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Literally everyone was cheery (rare to find anywhere), knowledgeable and quick (bussing tables). I tried to order some items that I saw photos of here on Yelp. The lady was apologetic and knew they were discontinued, quickly suggesting alternatives. After I ordered and waited a line formed and never stopped even when we were done dining.  Food was great and affordable."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have a unique menu and everything I've had is amazing! I'm couldn't be happier to have them close to our house! We have been dying to have something that quick but not greasy fast food!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Love that they have two sides to the menu. One healthy side and one fatty side. Sometimes you need a little bit of both especially if you're hung over on a Sunday. The place was packed but the service was friendly & quick. I ordered the Chicken Wrap Supastar and was happily surprised that something so healthy would taste so good. My boyfriend ordered the Cluck Moo and we both ate our plates clean. Can't wait to come back and try the different dishes. They all looked so good!"}
{"text":"Here in LV for work and I decided to stop by SkinnyFATS for lunch, I had the \"Steak Eyes\" & Spicy Chicken Tortilla soup.  Wow! Everything was on point. Great flavors and perfect size portions. Pricing was definitely reasonable for the quality. Overall is Great food and and a great atmosphere. Definitely will be back! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food here is great and there is such a great welcome when you come in the door. I love the variety of items on the menu and the juice is delicious. I think it's reasonably priced and the service is great! The staff member Miles goes above and beyond to really make sure everyone is happy. We will definitely return to this location!"}
{"text":"I typically really love Skinnyfats but recently the to go has really lacked proper attention. Sometimes I call my food in and I stand and wait for 15-20 minutes after getting there when I called it in about 15-20 minutes ahead of time. It doesn't seem like there's any sense of urgency or like anyone really cares. I watch them pack orders for the delivery services as mine sits there and waits on ranch. Since they have opened more locations I fear that this location suffers from neglect. I hope that once they complete the renovations they will have more room to work in a more effective manner that puts their guests needs first. At this time I will no longer be ordering from here as it does not benefit me to wait so long for orders, especially for a fried chicken salad."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty and the variety of beverages was nice. And DAMN the coffee was strong.   Only downfall is very few tables.   Yummy"}
{"text":"Tried the Skinny Fats on Decatur for the first time! Excellent food we tried the chicken and waffles and the bacon egg sandwich ( I forgot the clever names) also tried the cream soda and birch beer Staff was friendly food was excellent. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just had an epic meal at skinnyfats!! The place is super chill and the staff is helpful and friendly. I had a great Benedict burger The only reason I was able to eat the whole thing was because it was so damn delicious.  My mom got the smoke 'n a bowl which is indescribably delicious. My pops got the \"Dang Quesadilla\" which was so good that my mom claimed ownership of it halfway through our meal. Oh and speaking of moms, no meal would be complete with out a hot mame (edemame is sweet chilli sauce) Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"I have been to SkinnyFats around 4 or 5 times now and it seems like it is hit or miss. My company recently moved to the same business complex as SkinnyFats so it is a convenient place to eat when I don't have time to leave the office.I have never eaten in the restaurant because its always busy and I am not going to wait or rush for a table. I order my food online and either have it delivered or walk to pick it up. I only get the BLT(both happy and healthy) and both have been good and bad. The healthy option with turkey bacon I have gotten twice and it was good both times. The bad part was the fruit. It was horrible and tasted old. I wish I had taken a picture of it. I have got the happy option, with normal bacon, 2 or 3 times. The first time it was good the next two times I could barely finish it. This last time the bacon was mostly squishy fat. The truffle fries are really good. You have to eat them fresh and hot, if they get cold they taste funny. Overall all, its a cool place and I will update my review when I try something else."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile , first let me say this place is busy and seating is limited . My party of four tried to sit outside but found that the seats were extremely hot due to the seat cover material, so be careful. They have a pretty extensive menu (half healthy / half happy ), I ordered the \"#Merica\" ( Shaved NY strip chicken fried over biscuits n gravy with 3 eggs ). Order came out in about 7 minutes and it was piping hot, after the first bite I was hooked on this place. The only downfall with my meal was that I ordered my eggs over-medium and 2 of the 3 eggs were over cooked. Servers were very friendly and helpful, I will return to try another dish. :)"}
{"text":"SUPER good and fresh tasting BUT way over priced which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I like the fact that you can come with a variety of people and kids with different tastes and you can choose to eat healthy or \"not so healthy\" and EVERYTHING tastes great! My kids love it and beg to go all the time. My little one is obsessed with the cheese you dip the quesadilla in :-) yum! I'm obsessed with the Naked Chix and the amazing green sauce on the side... Getting hungry thinking about it. Worth trying if you haven't already... but be prepared to open your wallet and empty whats inside ;-) (ok ok... Maybe it's not THAT bad) :-)"}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to have a mother/daughter weekend in Las Vegas.  Right when we landed, she wanted pancakes so I did a quick Yelp search and SkinnyFATS came up with stellar reviews and mouth watering pictures.    We got there at 11:30 so the place wasn't too crowded yet.  This place is you order first, sit and they bring the food to you.  We ordered the following:   - Berry Cool Pancake ($4): it has FRESH strawberries, mickey mouse head shaped pancake, whipped cream drizzled with chocolate sauce.  My daughter loved it.    - Chickawaffadopolis ($12): fried chicken strips over a waffle.  The chicken was tender and juicy and the waffle was very yummy.  My daughter and I will definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"The name of this establishment is an oxymoron like Jumbo Shrimp, and Anaheim Ducks Hockey.  You can't be Skinny and Fat at the same time right?  Some guys are coming close!  The concept of this restaurant is very original.  Create two distinct menus that appeals to foodies of all types.  The health conscious and the zero f***ks given camp.  Guess what I am!? Exactly, my time at SkinnyFATS was spent browsing the fat portion of the menu.  I did do a quick browse of the healthy side and to be honest there was some items that I would order like the TBLT.  For the gordo's the choices are plentiful.  I ended up splitting 2 dishes  The CHIX on Broadway and the Sweet Cheese Us.  The CHIX on Broadway had to be the best chicken sandwich I ever had.  The fried breast was enormous and spilled over the sides of the bun.  It was crunchy, tasty, crispy.  It was a sensory overload for my taste buds.  The Sweet Cheese Us was very good as well, but the CHIX was the star of my meal that day.    The location is off strip and in an industrial part of town.  It is very accessible for those that are leaving Vegas and headed back towards LA since it runs parallel to the 15 freeway.  Seating can be a problem, its very small and is first come first serve.  Not a place for a huge gathering.  If you have time while in the Las Vegas area definitely check this place out.  For the type of food you are getting this place is an exceptional value.       Pros:  - Parking  Cons - Can be hard to find.  - Small seating area - Can get crowded and can cause long wait times"}
{"text":"Trying the skinny fats for the first time. Long line but don't be discouraged it moves fast. Had the salmon overboard and the more cow bowl. Both were delicious  will come back for sure. Want to try the cherry popper burger next time when am in the mood for a burger"}
{"text":"I have been fans of skinnyfats for years now. I have never had a complaint about the food, EVER :) Normally we always get the Chix on Broadway and the Sweet Cheese Us, our two all time favorites. This time I had the buff chx and it was delicious. Very moist! Great taste and can never go wrong with the truffle fries. They are one of the best truffle fries I've ever had. The reason I've chose to give 4 stars is because of the price increase... I don't believe it was necessary. The food is great, always has been but I won't be going as much as before because the price is above average. The interior is beautiful and they did a great job with this location. Keep up the good work skinnyfats, maybe think about putting prices the back to the same as your other locations..."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, this was my first and not last time going. I love that they offer a healthy and not so healthy menu. The buffalo chiks that I got had an amazing flavor. It had an immenseful amount of sauce, yet the sauce was almost glued onto the chicken strip, which helped the chicken keep its crispy crunch in every bit, and still each bit had plenty of sauce, flavor, and moistness from how well it was cooked. The truffle fries that came with it was seasoned with parsley I believe, and then something else that I can't put my finger on. The mystery flavor was a bit distracting to each bit of the fries as it was like a layer of sugar or seasoning or something, on the fries, along with the parsley. But in all, the food was amazing, the environment was warm and very friendly."}
{"text":"What a fun place to grab dinner!!!  It is a little hidden in the business park that it sits in in an industrial area off of Dean Martin...I only drove past it twice trying to find it! Hahaha  I had heard about this place from a few friends, and as I was done eating the same old thing for dinners, so I decided to finally try SkinnyFATS.  The restaurant is small with about 8 tables and a long window bar with stools to sit at.  There is one TV to watch and the decor was hip with paintings on the walls of fruits and vegetables.  As soon as I walked in, the young lady (did not get her name) immediately knew I had never been there before...guess I stuck out like a sore thumb!  hahahaha  Anyway, she guided me through the menu explaining the differences between the Healthy (skinny) dishes and the Happy (fat) dishes.  I could even order breakfast if I wanted as it was served all day.  I settled on \"Berry the Steak.'  It is a flat bread with shaved NY steak, feta and goat cheeses, arugula, balsamic reduction, and blackberries.  I also grabbed a side salad and a soda.  The side salad, though simple, was delicious.  Lettuce, tomato, and a few other veggies with ranch dressing.  Free refills on the soda!  Can't beat Dr. Pepper!  The flat bread was delicious!!!!!!  Nice combo of sweet (berries and balsamic) and peppery (arugula).  There was also nice texture with the crunchiness of the flat bread and the soft warm creaminess of the cheeses.  My only critique is, and this is being picky, is that the flat bread was a little hard to cut with a knife so that it could be cut into more manageable pieces to eat.  I think maybe pre-cutting it into 4 pieces (it's a square shape) might be helpful.  The staff was extremely friendly and totally willing to answer questions about the menu and various dishes.  They gave me a number, I sat at a table, and then delivered it to me when the meal was ready.  I highly enjoyed the meal and the vibe and am looking forward to going back.  Thanks SkinnyFats!  You have a new fan!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a good find while leaving Vegas! I was impressed with the service, taste, prices! I brought my family to this breakfast spot and everyone loved the experience. The cinutella French toast was just a flat churro (super sugary and double fried). I do not recommend, definitely stick to their pancakes. Also, the snake eye was amazing!!"}
{"text":"There is a reason that finding a parking space and standing in line for food is not a bad thing; it chases out the weak of adventure. Healthy and hearty are the options and weird, yummy, combinations reign. Eating my siracha mango ahi taco for breakfast now."}
{"text":"This place is what all the hype has gone to be! Food is amazing and employees are friendly! Everything is fresh and so goood! Definitely recommend the reduclious red velvet waffle!  Yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"I have been here for thirty minutes and only ordered a juice to go . Still don't have my juice. This place is awful"}
{"text":"What a great concept! And very well executed. Each menu item comes in a healthy (Skinny) version and a happy (Fat) version. We ate from both sides of the menu and were blown away. This place is a must."}
{"text":"Luv @ first bite. looking at the pics on yelp, the food doesn't seem too appealing but my niece ate here a few times and convince me to try it.. Boy was I glad I did!!  It's a small cute restaurant with patio seating and inside with some tables and a very high ginormous counter to share with others.. I'm short, so I had to climb up and jump off.. Hehe..don't recommend  I order chic on Broadway sandwich with sweet potatoe fries( best sweet fries EVER). The sandwich is huge, very crunchy and tasty.  My niece order the steak sandwich (forgot the name) which was not on the menu but the side screen.. Very good as well.. With truffle fries, I prefer sweet fries more... Oh there skinny fat sauce and sriracha mayo sauce was sooo good..  YUMMY I can't wait to come back and try other things in the menu"}
{"text":"So there is nothing I can say but OH MY GOSH THIS PLACE IS HEAVEN ON EARTH! I ate here and felt likens was on an episode of good eats or a food network special! The combination of ingredients on the fatty menus is nostalgia mixed with sensory overload! Literally my taste buds exploded! The skinny menu was equally as delicious and made me feel like I was cheating even though I wasn't!   The atmosphere is amazing and the staff was friendly! They even had healthy items I could feed my 2 yr old that has a horrible dairy and gluten allergy! Hands down I was impressed!  I recommend the chicken and waffles on the fatty menu! The chick with mango chuten and basil yogurt dip is amazing on the skinny menu! But seriously you can't go wrong!  The best part about this place is there is something for everyone. The patio was comfortable and was dog friendly! I will definitely go back and being friends!"}
{"text":"Five stars for this place. The food is amazing delicious. We ordered Cherry Popper add avocado and bacon, Wake N Bacon, and Hot Mess with sunny side up. We love everything here. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Keep it up SkinnyFATS."}
{"text":"This has got to be the most bland meal I've had in a long time. I got two dishes, the chicken was dry and flavorless, the rice was mushy, the salad was plain, and the green sauce had no flavor, just heat. definitely disappointed in this one. The servers were nice though"}
{"text":"It's quite pricey when you start adding up all the items from entree, sides, and a drink. The smoothie though is great like many have already wrote. I got the SkinnyFATS Punch ($6.95) and it was delicious. It's fresh and so refreshing to have after walking around in such a dry and hot place.   I also had the Zucc It ($7.95) without any additional protein, which is additional cost, and enjoyed it. I did order takeout and didn't get to taste the freshness of it, but felt it was a good option for a vegan meal. It was flavorful with the various vegetables and the sauce. I got the truffle fries ($3.95) on the side and it was underwhelming. I would return but try different items."}
{"text":"Really high quality food and really nice ambiance. I absolutely loved my waffle with berries and homemade SkinnyFats punch!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!  Everything is exceptionally good and I had to go twice during my visit to Vegas. Tried the tomato soup which is on point and the almond french toasts. Small place but you will not regret your visit after eating such goodness."}
{"text":"The food is tasty and each dish seems to have a nice twist to the common flavors. Their menu seems to be in constant rotation so it's difficult to pin down a favorite menu item when the menu constantly changes.   The only negatives are that the dining area is incredibly small, and the price is on the high side. It's enjoyable to have every once in a while, but it is cost prohibitive for most to have as a usual spot."}
{"text":"This little spot is placed so spontaneously within an industrial park setting that for a minute I thought I made a terrible, terrible choice. It turns out to be really delicious! The store was packed on a Friday noon, but still better than any burger spot on the strip.  You can tell easily that most of the customers were locals, and we just ordered a mix of whatever people ahead of us did - that includes the waffle fried chicken which I haven't had since forever. All of their food was good, and really, really fresh; my chicken sandwich was so juicy that you wouldn't believe you're actually in a desert for a second.  I was intrigued by how their menu had both a healthy side and a happy side (unhealthy side if you will), and I have tried some of both - no regrets. In a nutshell, don't feel concerned when you see no cars parked in the area nearby or the buildings look shabby, because it really IS there. Just walk in, hope you get a table, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that SkinnyFATS has the BEST sweet potato fries I have ever had.  Like seriously unbeatable.  I've also never actually been in to eat there, only ordered online for delivery so keep in mind that this review is exclusively about the food.  Their quality is very consistent each time and totally worth the $10 sandwich price.  My only reason for the 4 stars is that the wheat bun that they use for many of their sandwiches is incredibly thick so it's can be a little overwhelming to the rest of the sandwich.  If you like portobello burgers, the Vegwich is seriously delicious, a little spicy, and a little messy.  After a couple bites, I ended up using a fork."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats? Doesn't that cancel each other out? Anyways, I was in the area so I decided to stop by and see what they're all about since I seem to see everybody check in there almost every other day.  First of all the place is kind of a bit hard to find. It's located in a suite amongst other industrial businesses in a pretty large sized business complex. Typically not a setting you find a popular café in. Parking can get frustrating as well since you have so many other suites that equals to not a lot of parking.   When you come in, you will see that there is only one register and I would say about 7 to 8 medium tables. If you don't see a line going out the door, then you got lucky and just avoided the lunch/dinner rush. If you do get stuck in the rush, you better have a decent amount of time allotted not to have anywhere to go any time soon. Remember, you waiting in line, putting your order in, and waiting for your food to come put together equals a lot of patience because all those people that ordered ahead of you are in the same boat. So it takes time for you to get your food since everything is made from scratch.  With that said, I ordered the Burger Benedict, which has a half pound angus beef patty, lettuce, tomato, pickles, avocado, fried egg, and special SkinnyFats sauce. It was also accompanied by a side of truffle fries, which was a large enough portion to share with another. The fries were good with the two different flavored ketchups that were available on the tables which were Balsamic Vinegar and Jalapeno (refer to my pic).  All in all, what I had was very good. Its just the parking, location, and long wait that brought it down to a 3 star. I think a bigger place and more accessible location with a couple more registers would make it perfect.   Sidenote: They have free wifi. Domain is skinnyfats. Password is eatskinnyfats2."}
{"text":"First time : Very nice casual rustic restaurant with American style food selections. I had the shrimp boat as an appetizer. It was very delicious and fresh tasting.  Second time : I went back again and this time and got the Zucc it bowl, frickles and my husband got the Big Park burger with truffle fries. It was all delicious and very satisfied with the food. Definitely love it there."}
{"text":"Been a longtime fan, but this place has changed. Forgot the avocado on my TATS. Including their cookies which have gotten ridiculously smaller."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I work across the street and for weeks my co-workers kept ordering from there but it was always a missed opportunity for me. Finally luck was on my side and I was able to go try this heavenly place. I got a simple BLT but it was what I saw the gentlemen across from me eating that got my really attention. The Drunken Monkey Cakes!!! I swore I would get them the next time and they lived up to every imaginable fantasy I had in my head. Every bite was just more epic then the last.   I have tried a few things from both sides of the menu and have never been disappointed, as i am writing this I am debating on enjoying lunch or dinner over there today."}
{"text":"Happy they just opened this location at Downtown Summerlin! I went to the one close to the strip a few years ago and loved it. This place has a \"healthy\" side or \"happy\" side on the menu. So if you feel like eating healthy or bad, you have options. Haha.  Although I didn't see it on the menu here, you can order a red velvet waffle. I think it's on their secret menu? Anyway I tried it at the other location and it was delicious! At this location, I decided to be on the \"healthy\" side and ordered \"Naked Chix\" bowl while my brother decided to be on the \"happy\" side and ordered \"More Cow Bowl\".  - Red velvet waffle: Topped with cream cheese frosting, chocolate sauce, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and powdered sugar. Try it!   - Naked Chix: Mango basil chicken with jasmine rice topped with cilantro yo. Delicious! The chicken was tender and the portion was perfect.   - More Cow Bowl: Teriyaki filet mignon, cauliflower, portobello, peppers, scallion, egg fried rice. Since this wasn't my order, I only got to try some of it but I liked it and so did my brother! They gave a good amount of meat and it was tender! It was delicious as well!  This place is worth trying!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place!  The quinoa burger is out of this world!! Great hummus as well!!!"}
{"text":"We've only had our meals to go so I can't speak to the restaurant itself, but the food is pretty damn satisfying.  Our favorite is the fried chicken breakfast sandwich on a biscuit. It's just greasy and buttery enough to fulfill a craving but not overwhelming to the point you regret eating it.  The workers taking phone orders are always nice and have the orders ready to go in the stated pick-up time.   Someday we might actually dine in."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch--easy parking, clean restaurant. Great menu with healthy and \"happy\" options. I got the \"if you like\" smoothie from the juice side--cost $9.69 with tax but it's delicious. The food serving sizes are gigantic. Great, kind service. Tony and Kate were very helpful and informative.   Fun ambiance for a casual brunch with healthy options! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place for eats. Truffle fries were amazing, as well as you can get the sweet potato fries truffle style. Pizza is all gluten free (and good!).   They have many healthier options, as well as things similar to chicken and waffles. Now I've been to Roscoe's out in LA, and they have great chicken and waffles, but these guys offer a comparable dish.  Service was amazing! Decor was phenomenal. All their advertising was top notch too. Hands down, one of the better restaurants I've been to this year.  They are reasonably priced. I ordered the philly steak sandwich, $12 (it was the most expensive thing on the menu). Chix on Broadway sandwich for my wife, $9. Pizza for our daughter, $9. Our friend ordered the Cranberry Turkey burger, it was around $9. We all finished everything, but were stuffed. Everything was great.  Only downside is they are kind of out of the way. But they do cater, and they do deliver to nearby areas. Still worth a trip though, just to check out the spot.  Supposedly they're expanding to near Boca park and also near the downtown area. If you get a chance, check them out."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and the menu and food were fresh. The only reason for the 4 stars is because the salad I ordered was a bit overdressed. Next time I'll order the dressing on the side.     This is a second review, ( 9/8/17) I ordered through Postmates to get delivery. I have ordered the stuff on curry bowl in the past and really enjoyed it. This time however, it was terrible. It was completely bland yet overwhelmingly spicy at the same time, the noodles were undercooked , dried out, and had zero flavor, almost as if they didn't season it whatsoever. There were also about a pound of jalapeños in it, both raw and cooked and it was so overly spicy it was inedible. I'm extremely disappointed because I know the potential of this place but sad to say I probably won't order from here again.    Review number 3! After my bad experience last time and my prior review I'm happy to report that SkinnyFats reached out to me to make up for the bad meal. We were able to go back in and give another chance and I'm glad we did. The meal was fantastic and we'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Very very friendly staff. I would come back for this reason alone. Lucky the food was excellent too.   I was only passing through town on my way back to phoenix, but I was so impressed that I bought a gift card for my foodie friend who is moving to Las Vegas this month.   I know I will be stopping here when I come up to visit my friend."}
{"text":"Love, love love...Naked Chix and they anything they fry is AMAZING!  I always go with one healthy and one not so healthy because the flavors are just awesome.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food isn't cheap, but it's good! The food was full of favor. I liked the atmosphere. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"My kids love coming here. I actually never knew that skinny fats meant there is a menu for people who wanna stay skinny, and well a menu for people who want to get fat lol. With that said, this place has awesome food! Burgers, their zucchini dish, etc. is awesome. Prices aren't the cheapest, but it's still affordable.   Update: management contacted me about the service issue. Now, there is no issue! Good stuff Lana! 5 stars for you!"}
{"text":"I like their menu! One side of the menu is the 'skinny menu' with healthy food options. The other side of the menu is the 'happy menu' and obviously they are the fatty, junk stuff.  This place is located among other office buildings and it was hard to find this small place located amongst the offices. We went around the parking lot and finally found it. From outside it may look like it is closed, but once you open the door, there's a different atmosphere inside. With music, funky art on the wall, and friendly smiles, you'll be surprised!  We ordered a coffee, mocha and skinny acai bowls. The coffee and mocha were blah. The acai bowls were good and filling. I like the cute bowl in which the acai was served.  As it was getting closer to lunch time, the line to the counter was getting long!"}
{"text":"This is such a uniquely enjoyable experience. We could barely recognize the restaurant from the outside because their window hide their inside beauty. I had the classic burger with sweet potato fries, the burger was great! For some reason, I did feel that the burger wasn't that fatty and still well seasoned. The sweet potato fries were thinly cut. I shared half of my order with my boyfriend, he had the chicken burger with truffle fries. It was the biggest chicken burger I had ever, crispy and very much flavorful. I don't like the truffle fries because they taste very blend and a bit too tender/over cooked. I also had a giant oatmeal raisin cookie, to be honest, not as impressed as the burger."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about...ok food, good atmosphere, good service. A tad bit small, not a great location as it is an adventure to find it (especially with the construction going on).  Worth a shot if you have not tried their food.  Good sugar cookie!"}
{"text":"Fat Boys and Gym Rats of the world unite!  SkinnyFats is the Yin and Yang of the perpetually dieting community.  Their menu embodies the inner battle we all struggle with when deciding, \"What should I order?\"  Should I get a burger or a salad?  Should I be good or bad? Should I be fat or skinny?   Alas these are the questions only you can answer!  Well maybe not the last one, that might be up to genetics, and well the \"good or bad\" thing might be more of a moral issue.  Anyway, odds are most of you are going to order from the \"Happy\" side of the menu, but I can assure you if you take from the \"Healthy\" side you will be just as satisfied, as will your cardiologist."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. It was my first time there and I can't wait to go back. The place is a little small but I got there right before it got crowded. It has a healthy and regular menu. The window seating has wall outlets and even USB ports so that you can charge your phone is a nice feature. I ordered the berry strong waffle. It was very delicious and I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Ok so name and menu concept is a bit of a gimmick. But thing is food is good. Nice variety of food choices.  Everything we tried was both tasty and good value.  Service was reasonably efficient although ordering took a bit longer than it should. Just a decent place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Great food, but be very clear when ordering. I've had my food come out with things I've omitted several times, (ie. Smothered in powdered sugar or covered in maple syrup when it was requested on the side, etc.) I've also experienced my go to salad order drastically changing in size. But I'm not deterred. I think they're still working out kinks. They always immediately fix whatever the issue has been."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite SkinnyFATS location for a few reasons. The interior is super small which gives it more of a \"cult fave\" vibe. Service is always beyond A+. Every time I've been in there is a basketball game on, which I love. And the food here is unreal. I love that they have healthy and decadent options, since sometimes I'm in the mood for one and sometimes the other. A few faves:  Mean Bean, Chix on Broadway, Sweet Cheese Us, TATS, and Buff Chix."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch!  Very creative interesting and delicious food choices!  Very hard to choose just one thing to eat.  I ordered the eggs Benedict special, bacon, sausage, avo, poached egg on potato noodle..sauce has a little spice.  Also ordered red velvet waffles topped with chocolate chips, fruits and cream cheese whip!  Sooooooo good!  Coffee and drinks are refillable.  They also offer healthier choices for food.  Staff and service was great! Very accommodating and friendly.  Atmosphere is awesome with cool decor.  My kids loved the happy faces :)"}
{"text":"I like this place. The food is always fresh and the menu offers Vegetarian options which I sincerely appreciate. The employees are friendly and helpful.   My only issue is $8 for a large freshly squeezed orange juice is a little over the top. Regardless, I am a fan and will definitely be back to eat but I guarantee I will never order OJ again!"}
{"text":"Menu is waaayyyy to extensive to execute consistently. Came here for breakfast with the wife one day. Ordered the whole wheat pancakes...lucky me they came out stone cold. I'm not one to complain, so I just ate whatever I could put down. I work in the business, so I understand the pancakes were mostly likely prepped/made earlier. But at least throw them in the microwave??? Not impressed..."}
{"text":"burger with an egg was awesome...5/5 The classic was also awesome and some of my family liked that even better 5/5"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and haven't been disappointed. Kinda of pricey but you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try skinny fats forever- I finally ordered it from postmates and had it delivered.  OMFG THIS IS THE BEST CHICKEN SANDWICH IVE EVER EATEN.  EVER.  ID MARRY IT IF IT WAS SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE.  it's panko crusted and soooooo crispy- even after a twenty minute ride in the car! And that being said- it's super juicy. It's sooooo flavorful .  If I were a chicken, I'd say- take me now, I wish to become immortalized as one of your sandwiches.  I also got SPUDghetti.  That's spaghetti made of POTATO, covered in butter, cheese and green onion with sour cream. Such a fun and creative take on the potato!!!  Good for you skinny fats! I love you.  Xoxoxo Jennifer"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try skinnyFATS while visiting Las Vegas for EDC. Based on the previous reviews we were extremely excited to try it out. The line was almost out the door around 3 in the afternoon, so we had plenty of time to review the menu and make our choices. We decided to go with the Cherry Popper (since it was our first visit) and the Smoke-In-A-Bowl. We picked the skinnyFATS punch smoothie to drink along with one of their craft sodas made with sugar cane. I decided to also try one of their salted caramel cookies for dessert. The staff was extremely friendly and engaged in conversation with us. The food itself came out quick and was well prepared. The Hawaiian bread on the Cherry Popper burger was both delicious and unique. Our smoothie was extremely refreshing and the reusable cup with a happy meter was also a cool touch! I wish we had skinnyFATS locations in Florida because it would easily be one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Katie was awesome! Replaced forgotten milkshakes with kindness and ease. Skinny fats always has a way with my heart.   Thanks manager Katie for being so sweet!"}
{"text":"We moved to Vegas about two years ago. And I saw Skinny Fats on my Facebook feed but I had never eaten there. They popped up on my newsfeed again on Mother's Day. So we went over at around 2:30  to try it out. I am so glad we did! The place was very busy, but the line went fairly quick. And the food was excellent! Very good quality and at a very fair price. My husband got one of the hamburgers and a strawberry shortcake sundae that was on special. I got Happy chicks (bacon, eggs, sausage, etc.) and Blueberry Yum Yum. It was a ton of food and of course I couldn't eat it all. But there were so many choices that we wanted to try everything!  And we have been there two more times this week! I took my friend and my daughter. This is my new favorite breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Can we get SkinnyFATS is LA? The menu has a healthy side and a happy side. Everything on the menu looks great, with items like waffles and avocado toast. I was craving a waffle and lo and behold, they have a protein waffle! The healthy side also indicates the calories.  This location is open for breakfast at 8am and there were already quite a few people here when I came in at 9."}
{"text":"Great spot to stop for breakfast or lunch, tasty burgers and nice crafted salads, all made with fresh tasting ingredients and presented well. They have great daily specials as well that are not on the menu, I would def come through again to eat and try as many different things as i can. Even the display of cookies are worth giving a try."}
{"text":"I loved SkinnyFATS. The menu is very unique and allows a family to done without upsetting any member. There are calorie counts listed for the \"Skinny\" menu options, which was fantastic for me--and my sons and husband loves the options on the FATS side of the menu. Be aware, lines form quickly and tables may be hard to come by at peak times."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch and left with breakfast. I couldn't help myself, the Steak Eyes looked too good to pass up and I'm glad I didn't. So good! Getting a table seems like a pain during lunch hours seems like a pain, so I'm glad I went in planning to get it to go."}
{"text":"The reviews are spot on. This place has great food, a great menu, and great people working. Went for brunch on a Tuesday and there wasn't much of a wait. I can only imagine the lunch or dinner rush.  Had the one eyed monster and a coffee which was delicious. Ambiance is nice and food tastes delicious.  Will definitely come back for a burger."}
{"text":"I  have been here a number of times and tried several different items on the menu. My favorite comfort food from here is the tomato soup and grilled cheese. Just enough to fill me up. It's a cup of soup which is not a creamy soup but a true tomato soup with lots of great flavor. The grill cheese comes on grilled Parmesan toast with a few different kinds of cheese which gives it really grea flavor. The sandwiches are very large servings which each time I have had half a sandwich to take home. The servers are fantastic and very attentive checking to make sure everything is ok once food is delivered. I have brought my vegetarian daughter here and there was plenty for her to choose from. My son also enjoyed his chicken sandwich when he came to visit. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner and I have eaten here for all three and have yet to be disappointed with anything. Prices are ok for what they serve. They also have some great desserts that they offer as well, but I have to be honest, I never have any room left and have yet to try any of them. This is a must try, I don think you will regret it."}
{"text":"Had the classic burger and fries with a order slow boat to china. Amazing food with nice people, would come here again. Just sucks you got to get up and get your own water, place is a little small so you gotta hear other peoples conversation here and then but overall worth going."}
{"text":"Great service man I fell in love w the chick taking my order, but the food is amazing And the place looks cool - Angel Acosta"}
{"text":"That was definitely a found!!!  Browsing yelp to find a place to have dinner I thought the reviews were a little bit exaggerated but I gave it a try anyway. And it was just amazing. The decoration, the jokes on the walls, the staff... everything was great. And then the food came and I thought OK, NOW I GET IT!  It was so fresh and had such amazing flavors on the burger, I was really impressed.  The menu is just genius, perfect for couples that have a fat and a fit person together (as me and my husband).  Please guys, come to Miami ASAP."}
{"text":"One of my favorite to go to for lunch! It does get a little pricey especially if you add in a shake/juice. I usually like to order the Meltdown and a customizable shake. You are still allowed to customize shakes with up to 4 ingredients for the same price that all the other shakes cost. It can get crowded during peak hours so tables can be limited because the place isn't that big. When I came in today, I realized they had their own bottle of chipotle ketchup which tasted alright to me."}
{"text":"Really yummy unique food here and great customer service!!!! I really enjoy the enviorment here it is soo different from any other resturant in Las Vegas! Must try their smoothies especially the (Garden Treat) they are soo delicious!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked up to eat at about 8:51.  We noticed it was closing in 9 minutes so we turned around to go find something else to eat because it was so close to closing time. One of the employees (I believe a shift manager) saw that we turned around, she opened the door and told us to come on in.  We told her we didn't want to be \"those people\" and she told us to not worry about it and that they were happy to have us in.  She was beyond friendly and had such good energy around her.   A different employee took our order and rang us up.  She was super sweet and had a good energy.  She took the time go to over the beer menu with us and she seemed happy even though we came in at close.    The food was great too but the customer service is what made me review this place!  Hands down one of the best experiences I've had since moving to Vegas 10 years ago."}
{"text":"We were deciding between bonchon chicken or skinnyfats, ive never been to skinnyfats before so we ended up eating here. The name was a bit confusing to me, as was the menu.   Half of the menu is \"skinny\" and the other half is \"fats\", my eyes glazed over the skinny side, the fat side seemed alot more filling and delicious.   I ordered the cheesesteak us sandwich with sweet potato fries and my friend ordered the whole wheat burger with truffle fries. The food came out pretty quickly,  about 10 min!  My sandwich was cheesey and had a generous amount of meat. I loved the cheese sauce they put on top. They also gave a huge portion of fries.   They had a lemon blueberry cookie i wanted to try, but unfortunately they ran out of, so i ended up getting a salted caramel cookie. This cookie was crispy, chewy, and sweet all at the same time.   Skinnyfats is a great concept and i cant wait for them to expand to ca."}
{"text":"This please Is really good and fresh, never once have I ever had a problem staff is very kind and knowledgeable of there menu. Really does hurt the wallet a bit."}
{"text":"Good food, kind of pricy though. Love the atmosphere! Also they don't have regular sodas which at first I was kind of skeptical of, but they were actually really tasty!! I ordered the cherry popper with truffle fries, and the mahi taco (don't remember the exact name) and the burger was alright, nothing too special. The taco was popping with flavor! Different taste, but deff good! Overall a nice little spot."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing food and seriously amazing staff. Every time we go in we are greeted with a smile, even on night like tonight when we stumbled in 20 minutes before closing. I have tried over half the menu and never been disappointed. The Truffle fries are a must and the fried pickles are something I can't not order. And a special thanks to Tony for always being helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"You guys seam to always hire the nicest coolest staff. Love the food. Love the atmosphere. So glad I was brought upon this place. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love this location! Super cute outdoor seating and more space inside than dean Martin location. Love their food! Great service!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a staple regular for my boyfriend and I's foodie adventures. The juices are amazing. I had the hangover remedy the last time I was there and it matched perfectly with my buff chix. Typically we go for the chicken and waffles plate to share with truffle fries. BC well Fries. It's always satisfying. Thanks for having such an upbeat crew too!"}
{"text":"We went to the location that was in an industrial area. Small but cozy place that had 6 tables and some counter space. You stand in line and order before you are seated. Eggs Benedict, avocado toast, and waffles. All were excellent. This place doesn't disappoint. Prices were reasonable. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Just left delicious food everything was perfect until I was leaving I just watched a cook with an apron on walk out the restaurant in his apron into the hardwood flooring store next door then back into the restaurant HEALTH CODE VIOLATION QASA HELP THEM!! He was tall with dark curly hair .. Even if he is not a cook you never leave the kitchen or behind the counter with an apron on.. Gave two stars because the food was great  and service was awesome the girl at the counter gave recommendations and everything however seeing that turned my stomach"}
{"text":"Sooooo yummy!! Tu-nuts bite, warm chocolate cookie, and delightful cucumber shake were so refreshing!!"}
{"text":"I've gained like 10 pounds because of this place. The menu is divided into two sections, the \"Skinny / Healthy\" section and the \"Happy / Fat\" section. I obviously order from the happy section because I was born to have a good time not to live a long time."}
{"text":"what a great concept! i can go here and order my hearts desire and my gf can munch on her healthy salad. the restaurant is quaint and artfully decorated. that menu though is one of those why didnt i think of that things. well done."}
{"text":"now I get the chicks on broadway and I asked for no lemon sauce and they put lemon sauce on it. I tried one more to give them another shot and this time I said the same thing but also no tomato or onions and guess what was on it. So I won't be going here anymore"}
{"text":"It's taken me awhile to visit this location - and the moment I did, I came back 2 days later because it was that good. Located conveniently off Durango and 215, this place offers the same healthy and happy foods for those of you who live on the westside, without having to drive over to Dean Martin. A few months ago when I found out some of my favorites were going to be cut from the menu, I was a bit sad, but eating here recently confirms that those cuts allowed them to really focus on their current menu offerings and really improve them. Some of my favorite items are the Wrap Supastar - healthy, but delicious take on a breakfast wrap. The chicken is unbelievably not dry and the produce they use was so fresh. For those of you looking to be happier and splurging, get the Steak Eyes for breakfast. Their biscuits and gravy are so much better than the standard fare you get at any old regular breakfast spot. Their cold press juices are also well made and come in reusable, dishwasher safe containers. There's also a patio out here that makes you feel like you aren't in the middle of a strip mall and a drugstore is just right across the street - very well done! My couple of gripes - my chocolate chip cookie was harder than usual, instead of chewy like I'm used to at Dean Martin location, and headlights of cars parking right in front are pretty blinding. Otherwise, very friendly and helpful staff and very clean and appetizing place!  Pro Tip: ask for their homemade sriracha mayo to dip your fries in."}
{"text":"First the food! Most flavorful and delicious! Second the staff! Been going so often they know mine and my fiancé's name...walk-in, call or online ordering it is quick and they always get the special requests right.   For peak hours call ahead with your order it makes life so much nicer ;)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and healthy. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I have an egg allergy and was able to get good information without feeling like I was bothering them."}
{"text":"Went back to try other menu options.  The filet of fire was fantastic.  A little spicy but very lean and tender filet meat this time.  Will have this again."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh food. They have a whole menu that is healthy, low calorie and a separate menu for people that want to splurge. It's a little expensive, but well worth it for the fresh food. They also do fresh pressed juices to-go as well. I've had their low cal waffle (made with protein powder and fresh berries. Very good!) and their ahi tuna sandwich (Teri-ahi. Delish). Everything is made to order and perfect. Health sides (salads, fruit, sweet potato fries). Their iced tea is great too. One of my favs in the valley."}
{"text":"we've been looking for a yummy place that delivers around our place of business. we work in an industrial part of town so there isnt much. the couple places we have found have started out good, and then slowly became what we didnt like (new management/new menu).  so today we did a new yelp search hoping for something new and different and we found it! Skinny Fats will def be on our list for delivery options for us and our clients. please keep it up, we do alot of business with places we like and we'd hate to lose you! thank you!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here a few time. It's a good place for lunch. There's a choice of healthy and happy meals. I like how there's a calorie count to the food. Naked chix is what I usually get and it's really good! I would recommend this place to anybody!"}
{"text":"The wait if you come here at the wrong time is unbearable! They have a very small space but the food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Best hole in the wall place! My fiance and I ate here one night. The service was exceptional and the people were so friendly! Plus, the food was delicious! Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Ohhh SkinnyFATS. You are three parts delish, one part disappointment.   Sue and I decided to go off strip for our food the first night we were in Vegas, and came across SkinnyFATS via yelp. The reviews were rave and the prices were rad, so we popped over for a few bites.   We had the: chicken and waffles (of course) - 3-1/2 stars truffle fries ('cause 100 yelpers recommended it) - 1 star sweet potato fries - 5 stars shrimp boat (did you say shrimp... boat) - 4-1/2 stars tuna tacos - 4 stars  Avoid the truffle fries. Seriously. Unless you want to be disappointed... 'cause it just tastes like regular fries with too much salt. It was so overhyped that we started to call everything we've ever been disappointed in life truffle fries: that terrible anti-climatic arch in the Valley of Fire? It is henceforth renamed \"truffle fries\" arch. The boy who was a serious let down? He's gonna be the truffle fries boy. That... well, I'm gonna stop here. You get the point.   Don't order the truffle fries.   Fun atmosphere, fast food, great service, generally innovative prep make this a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Appearance: loved the look of the restaurant and decor.  Service: Everyone was friendly and helpful.  Food: Ordered chicken and waffles. Waffle was cold and tasteless. Chicken batter was good, but chicken taste like there was no seasoning on the chicken prior to being battered. Just bland!"}
{"text":"Omg.  Best place ever best food.  Everytime I go I get something different from the menu and everything is just superb I love this place"}
{"text":"We stopped on a whim for a fast lunch before heading on a Grand Canyon road trip. My son and I were thrilled with how delicious our food was and I was thrilled with the healthfulness of the ingredients and the relatively low prices (compared to the Strip). We highly recommend the Berry Strong Waffle and the TeriAHI sandwich."}
{"text":"Great place, innovative and tasty food.  Everything my friend and I have tried we have loved, it doesn't seem like you can go wrong.  Limited amount of tables and can get very busy at lunch time but online ordering and phone apps make it much easier to just walk in and pick it up.  Eat there at least 4-6 times a month.   Lots of cute girls on staff too."}
{"text":"Delicious & nutritious!! Lots of variety on the menu to choose from. Healthy side & a \"normal\" side of menu for those that don't care :) only complaint is place is small so seating is limited-otherwise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a sunday. Good food brings the crowds. Got the WTFrench toast. It was great. Best sweet potato fries ive ever had. Ill be back to try more options. Thier menu is huge for such a small place."}
{"text":"again, I cannot stress the advice to people visiting Vegas to visit & eat places off the strip. place is hip, friendly, delicious and healthy. the ambiance is super chill, the staff is great and the food is amazing with a little of every thing. I recommend the chix broadway sandwich. The naked chix were great as well and (see photo) the Skinny Bowl with Acai Sorbet, granola, bananas, strawberries, almonds, and agave nectar is ridiculously delicious. As is their hot mame (see photo) which is chili garlic edamame. Great find!!!! please expand to LA, haha"}
{"text":"I'm jealous that Las Vegas has a Skinny Fats and San Diego doesn't. This is an ideal place for me - great healthy food options and fresh juices/smoothies. It's a one stop shop. My husband loved his Neato burrito. He hardly ever raves about food, but he kept saying how good it was. It was full of steak, eggs, and potatoes. It was huge too. My ahi srirachi was bigger than I expected. It was delicious, although messy. The mango relish really paired well with the ahi. The grilled chix was just ok for me. The chicken was a little tougher than I would have liked and the sauce was a tad sweet. But the battered chix (I can't remember the exact name) was better, with a nice crust.   All the workers there were really nice. You can expect a wait (we went on what I thought was a super busy day, but they said that was actually a slower day). But as we waited, they made sure we were comfortable and sparked up conversation.   Try the juice where you pick up to 4 ingredients. My pick was: strawberry, basil, lemon, and apple. Oh Em G. I could drink this every day!"}
{"text":"From 125 th street to Roscoes in L.A. I've had several versions Of Chicken n Waffles. Beautifully done and simple decor, good tunes and a genuine super friendly staff just added to the flavor of the food. The chicken was seasoned and crispy just right ; along with an awesome Waffle with just the right amount of Syrup."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.   I have had this place bookmarked for quite some time. When Island Flavor was closed up the street, we called an audible and decided to finally try SkinnyFATS.  I ordered the S'motherload ($11.99), which is a breakfast style burrito with steak, sausage, and peppers, mushrooms, pico included. My friend ordered the Hot Mess, which is a bowl that includes  flour tortilla, chips, buffalo chicken bites, pico, cheese sauce, jalapenos, sour cream & jalapeno ranch sauce ($9.95).  The S'motherlod was actually pretty good. This isn't a burrito that was meant to be picked up and eaten, but enjoyed using a fork and spoon. It was good, but not nearly worth the price tag. More like $7 dollars.  The Hot Mess was an epic disappointment. The chicken was way too salty. There was the tasty of salty chicken, jalapenos, cheese sauce....it was such an awkward mish mash of things that did not lead to a pleasant taste. It was so unsatisfying that I had to stop and grab something to eat on the way home. Seriously.   Service was nothing to write home about either. The girl at the counter who took our orders was pleasant, but the waitress was borderline rude and argumentative. Seating was also cramped and uncomfortable. I understand it was during a busy time (Sunday, 6pm), but it was pretty claustrophobic.  These 2 dishes plus 2 small sodas ran us $29.05. So, that means the sodas had to be in the $3 to $4 neighborhood each.   Ugh. Totally not worth it.  This is definitely a \"one and done\" for me.   2 stars.  Meh. I've experienced better."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS has a cult following, and I can totally see why. I love the \"Healthy v. Happy\" menu concept, even if the options aren't 100% comparable side-by-side; it makes reading the menu fun, and it's not like the Healthy side is boring - there's some very enticing options on there.  The stars must have aligned when we visited on a Saturday night, since we easily found parking and didn't wait for a table - and we got here at 6:30? I'm not gonna question it, but I can see how frustrating it could get since this place is pretty tiny.  I wanted 1 Healthy, 1 Happy, and it took me about a solid 10 minutes to decide on what to eat. I ended up ordering the Naked Chix (Healthy: mango chicken on rice) and the Ahi Taco San (Happy: ahi tempura on a puffed shell) - both very satisfying after a day of hiking. The combination options are endless!  Service is really friendly, and it's just a cute place to eat. If you've got a car (most likely, since it's not particularly close to anything other than the airport), I'd suggest checking out one of their other locations to avoid any potential headache of parking or waiting. The food is, I think, worth it, though!"}
{"text":"I love love this place . Service is awesome and I totally recommend the cherry burger!"}
{"text":"Delicious! If you are craving comfort food at a fraction of the calories, this is the place to go! They don't compromise taste or aesthetics. Everything looks so delicious. The only down side is that this location does not have a lot of seating. But I did see another location in Summerlin that is an actual restaurant setting not a deli setting as this one. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Great place to go with your friends. Customer Service: Great staff, I don't know if it's a hipster thing but all their staff are younger and super positive, seems like the type of place I would love to work at. Food: I love the Sunday Sundae! I guess they change it up every week and honestly the presentation of all their dishes are awesome! Also you have a choice to go healthy or not so healthy so it's a great place to go if you have a vegetarian or vegan friend cause they have a lot of vegetarian dishes and for the most part you can modify a dish to make it vegetarian. Price: For the quality and amount of food that you receive it's inexpensive. Overall Experience: Overall awesome! Great job guys! Few places I can say this about but I could actually eat at SkinnyFATS every meal of the day every day."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Great place to go with your friends. This location is so much bigger than the other one on Dean Martin. I love their decor, super arty and hip!

{"text":"I originally didn't want to come here because if the name....sounds like a sandwich shop. That itself made me take the star away. My boyfriend pushed me to check it out and I actually liked it. When I came here the customer service was good. The cashiers knew a lot of about the menu and gave useful recommendations. I got a chicken sandwich and truffle fries; both were very delicious!!! I also got a chocolate chip cookie...I've had better but it was still pretty good. The place is very casual. I like the option of having healthy or non healthy choices. It's a convenient and casual restaurant. It would be nice to see this place become a chain restaurant in other states. Just change the name...."}
{"text":"Ooooooh~ I'm so glad I stopped by here before leaving Vegas!   I tried their meltdown w/ truffle fries! So delicious! The sandwich was recommended to me by one of the workers! So good! Truffle fries also delicious!   The place itself is pretty small, but didn't wait long to find a seat!"}
{"text":"Sweet cheezus. Enough said. Absolutely love the food ! Never disappoints when we are there and they are pretty busy all the time but we never have to wait long"}
{"text":"Justin was our server and he was awesome ! This was my second attempt at skinnyFATS and justin was able to suggest exactly what I was wanting to try. Being a picky eater it's hard for me to try new things to eat ESPECIALLY healthy options. I will be coming to this location more often.GREAT service and GREAT food is what you will find coming here."}
{"text":"Cons: 1) none   Pros: 1) have organic stuff; 2) have outside terrace where you can enjoy your food and relax; 3) delicious burgers."}
{"text":"This place is decent but its difficult to go to any restaurant that litters their menus with moronic innuendo puns.  An item called \"Naked Chix\" in a restaurant full of elementary aged kids?  Come on. That's a dated marketing method that may have amused a few sushi bar college kids 15 years ago but in a community far from any gentrified downtown in 2018 it seems desperate, contrived and dumb."}
{"text":"Food is excellent here.  Don't fall asleep and miss this one.  Worth the wait.  I had the caulifire-cauliflower.  Delicious.  Zucc it.  Nice collaboration of veggies and spices with a little heat.  Would order this again with a grilled chicken breast on top.  Need I say more."}
{"text":"The food tastes good but it is a bit pricey. I had the more cow bowl and although it tastes great, the rice is completely drenched in the special sauce they use. Root beer float is not that good because the ice cream doesn't really have a rich flavor to it, very bland. The place is always too crowded and it is very hard to find seats to dine in. It is best to order for takeout just in case there are no seats. Staff seems a little annoyed when you switch your order to takeout due to lack of seats. If you order water as a drink you must get it yourself by squeezing between the line of people since the water dispenser is located right where the line is."}
{"text":"Super yummy and on the healthy side. My sister had the Egg White Omelet and I had the Enchiladas Eggs Benedict. Everything was flavorful and what I'd call traditional with a twist. My fav was the rose wine frosty! I bet that's so refreshing later in the day. I did taste the spicy mustard on the table just for shiggles...and was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I have eating in here several times...I want to like it ...I really do...love the concept and the decor....but nothing that comes out of that kitchen hits the mark.  I can't find anything on the skinny menu I would eat twice and the fat menu just isn't well executed. (I.e. Stale bread on a sandwich, soggy fries...ect)"}
{"text":"We came here not really knowing what to expect. The line was pretty long and it could have gone by quickly if the lady in front of us wasn't being super picky about her order and asking millions of questions.  The place reminded me of a garage that a band used to play in and instead decided to clean it up and turn it into a restaurant. It was kind of cool.  Food was great. I ordered the wrap supastar without chicken and it was so good. I really enjoyed it. My husband ordered the tofu sandwhich and he wasn't too impressed with it. We split the cinnutella and it was delish and it definitely made us overly full. But I don't regret ordering it. Orange juice was so refreshing. You can tell it was fresh squeezed. We love and appreciate the vegetarian and vegan options.  Customer service was good and they were very accommodating.   I would definitely come here again if I were ever to find myself in Vegas again."}
{"text":"My son and I were hungry and wanted something new. We stopped by skinny fats for the first time tonight. Nikki was at the counter and was super cool and helpful with explaining the menu. I ordered the chicken parm sandwich which was the bomb!! My son order the American and wasnt thrilled with it...he is pretty picky! Nikki asked if everything was ok and could tell he wasnt happy. She asked what else he might like and quickly exchanged his order. He was so pleased! Because of Nikki we will be back soon and often!! Better hold onto her before someone steals her away!!"}
{"text":"Oh my!  I first found out about SkinnyFats from doing an event with them (Yelp Helps).  I loved what they were serving there, so I couldn't wait to try it out!  The location is kind of strange, but the food is amazing!  Small dining space.  I didn't know you could grab a table before ordering so we didn't, and by the time we ordered they were all full.  We had to sit at the high bar against the window, which was difficult with a 22 month old kid.  Of course, I ordered from the \"eat happy\" (aka FAT) side.  I think it was a special burger, the \"Cherry Popper.\"  SOOOOOOOOOOO yummy!  Cherry and banana peppers, fried egg, cole slaw, and cheese on a burger on a Hawaiian bun.  I'm still thinking about it.  The fries were yummy too (sweet potato).  I ordered a smoothie for my daughter and I tasted it.  It was very yummy, but tasted more like a milk shake (it said strawberries, blueberries, and peanut butter, but it was white and I saw no hint of berry but did taste like a peanut butter milk shake).  Not sure it was as nutritious as I'd hoped, but delicious nonetheless.  Also, I got her some healthy tacos and tried a bite; they were great!  My dad and his wife fully enjoyed their meals as well!  I can't wait to take my husband here.  The ambiance is cute, definitely for the younger crowd.  I'm young myself, but, maybe it's because I'm a mommy, I get more sensitive to innuendos...\"cherry popper\" sandwich, a banana on the men's restroom door, and a peach on the women's restroom door....there were other innuendos but I can't recall.  I'm just sensitive, as I don't think kids would really get them anyway, so I still think it's a fun place to take kids!   I'm still thinking about that burger!!  I want to try something from the \"eat healthy/skinny\" side, but I'm sure my inner fatty will tempt me again!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited SkinnyFATS opened another location that is much more convenient (for me)!  I have been here a couple of times with my 2-year-old and she loves it.  She loves the peanut butter smoothie and sweet potato fries.    The first time at this location, I got the chickhumm, which is a chicken breast sandwich with hummus and sprouts.  Skinny side.  It was good, but not oh-my-gosh.  I've learned that I need to only get stuff from the fat side!  The last time I went there, I got the sweet cheesus, which is a steak sandwich with nacho cheese and hot peppers.  Totally more my style!    I sent my hubby here and twice he got stuff from the skinny side and said it was decent but not excited to go back.  I told him that he needs to get stuff from the fat side, obviously!  I mean, I'm glad they have those options, but we eat healthfully at home usually, so I'm just going to continue only getting from the \"happy\" side.  :)  It is open until 11pm, which is great for us, because we can pick stuff up after work (hubby works late and it's hard for us to get food after 10pm).  For that, we are thankful!  Also, the price is very affordable.  I'd rather spend $12 on an OMG sandwich than go to Subway late and spend $6 on bleh.  Thanks, SkinnyFATS, for making yummy food available in the SW and open late enough for us to enjoy!  We will likely be here once a week.  Even the kid keeps asking, \"Are we gonna go to SkinnyFATS, Mommy?\""}
{"text":"Stoped in and it was wonderful. It's a busy fun environment, where the food is exceptional. Take some time to check out the original sauces."}
{"text":"My place of business is just around the corner from this awesome restaurant! The food is delectable, the healthy alternatives vs. the amped up fattier selections are quintessentially  rated as pure yumminess in my book! I love it all. I'm a health nut and yes, if your wondering if I've consumed the higher fatty foods from their  Skinny Fats menu, well-  I most definitely have and it was all amazingly delectable!!  We all need a cheat day once in awhile.     My husband and I are honored to be vendors for  all their locations and each place has been an amazing dining experience! What are you waiting for peeps? Go now, GO!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you like to eat healthy and your friends don't  the prices are not bad at all and the atmosphere is very calm. They have breakfast food too! I will continue to come back to this place."}
{"text":"Young people food. Staff was polite. But food was inedible for people over sixty. We had soup and a burger. Both were disgusting.  5/13/2018  Lana S., Manager Subject: Your Review \"Hello Andrew,   Thank you for your review, could you let me know what was on your burger and what soup you ordered? I want to make sure they are being prepared to our recipe. I'm terribly sorry that you did not enjoy your food, we would have been happy to remake your meal or provide a completely new dish for you had we known. I understand you are not eager to return but I would be happy to provide a $30 credit for a future visit should you change your mind. I simply need your name, phone number and email address to store it under in our system. I hope to hear from you soon.  5/13/2018 Andrew S.  Hello Lana,  I believe we had carrot soup and a burger and some Salad. Your staff was polite and did their best to accommodate us. We live in California and do not want a coupon or a meal credit.  Thanks anyway,"}
{"text":"I love that they have a healthy and happy side of the menu so you can try different things every time. I have taken people from out of town there and they always enjoy it. The food is always great."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is so hyped! The food is solid, but the place is tiny and so dang crowded all the time. We got a couple of dishes and they were all good, nothing mind blowing. Prices were reasonable. Large selection on the menu. Plenty of parking. They have cool cups."}
{"text":"Healthy or Happy.  I have had both sides of the menu and happy to me is always better. :) The first time I came here I was trying to eat healthy and order sweet potato fries and eggs. They just weren't very filling or tasty. I came again to try a bowl. I got the smoke in a bowl. It comes chicken, peppers, pineapple, rice, and beans. It was OK. It wasn't very flavorful and just didn't fill me. I really love the black cheery soda they have tho. So tasty! Also they have lemon and cucumber water for guest. The last time I came with some friends and ordered from the Happy side. I did get a salad, but I got the Hot Chix. OMG, bleu cheese party in my mouth. It comes with buffalo chicken, avocado, pico, fried jalapeno strips, bleu cheese and buffalo ranch. It was so good! So much great flavor and it was so filling! My friend got the spicy cauliflower and said it was so hott. She also got some kind of chicken sammich and said it was very plain and also not filling. Honestly, I need to stick to the Happy side because it makes me happy! I always see they special on Facebook and I think i need to try their cookies and sundaes. They look amazing!!! Until the next time SkinnyFATS!"}
{"text":"I was contacted by a manager and they apologized for the poor service I received. They offered me a credit and I used it to order food online and pick it up. I had the same experience as before, the food was delicious and the service was a mess. The order was placed online two hours before I wanted to pick it up and I even called to confirm it. I arrived a couple of minutes late and then had to wait in line so by the time I got to the counter it was 15 minutes after my pick up time. I was told that they were not done making our food and we had to wait for 10 more minutes. Meanwhile, the people behind the counter looked lost, they kept messing with the floor mats and fiddling with things even though it was the middle of the lunch rush. Once we finally got our food they just gave it to me and sad thank you. I had to remind them that we still had to pay and they had us wait in line to pay. Our food was somewhat soggy by the time we got back to the office but it was very tasty. We had the shrimp and ahi cucumber boats and a burger they were all delicious The frickles are amazing!!"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, and I have been here 2 times. Both times the food was delicious! The customer service was great. The seating is limited though since it's usually busy. I went to the restroom for the first time, and I loved the design, but it took some effort to close the women's door all the way to make sure it clicked. I'm sure the person before me didn't realize it wasn't shut all the way, so when I pushed it, the door opened and I accidentally walked in on her (oops). We had chosen carry out and when we got home, I realized they forgot an item. I called the store and the person I spoke to, I believe her name was Megan, was happy to help me. It was definitely a relief after the kind of day I've had. We will be coming back more often!"}
{"text":"Amazing food for a solid price. The sandwhich i ordered had Nashville fried chicken covered in dry rub that was spicy and had bits of brown sugar that mixed well with a side of truffle fries. This was all only $12, other gourmet burger spots would charge just this for the burger alone and upsell the fries at $3-4. Customer service was great and the place had chill vibe."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My boyfriend and I try to come here once every few weeks and it never disappoints. I'm a vegetarian and he eats anything and everything so there's something for everyone!  If I feel skinny enough to consume some extra calories I'll get the Happymess and substitute the steak for portabello mushrooms. Yum! Pretty much anything on the menu can be made vegetarian so just ask!  If you follow Skinnyfats on Instagram you can get the scoop on what specials they have that day and what's on the secret menu."}
{"text":"I have always heard great things about this place, and im loving there atmosphere and the great food they have."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places in town to go eat! Their menu has various dishes. Some unique dishes but I always feel like there's something for everyone. Sadly they took my favorite thing off the menu, the Greek pizza but last time I went I got a tomato bisque and grill cheese and that was tasty. They are also accommodating if you really didn't enjoy your meal. My friend wanted to be adventurous and try one of their specials. He didn't end up liking it and they were happy to make him something else. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"This location is the original location. I prefer the Warm Springs location because of the size and amount of seating...(aside from the fact it is closer to my house). With that said, I love SkinnyFATS, period. I tried the Drunken Monkey Cakes and fell in love. I always order pancakes elsewhere and find myself looking for more flavor. Granted, they're covered in syrup, bananas, whipped cream, chocolate chips, and marshmallows...but it works!! Now if only this location had the Boyland drinks!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband and I eat here at least once a week. The menu has a ton of variety without skimping on taste. Not only is their food amazing but their customer service is fantastic! I highly recommend SkinnyFATS if you're looking for great food and a laid back ambience."}
{"text":"What an interesting concept, mashing two menus of healthy and unhealthy or \"happy\" food all in one. The location of this place is weird, almost like you're driving to a doctor or lawyers office parallel to I-15.   I decided to go with the monkey cakes (s'more/banana pancakes) and a side of healthy brown rice. Interesting combo I agree!  The brown rice was really good and fresh. The pancakes were a large portion but unfortunately the bananas are not baked into the batter, but placed on top. Overall they were good cakes but not to the level of Eat or Gold Spike cafe.   That being said I love the concept and will return to try a few more menu items. The prices are fair so I see no harm!"}
{"text":"Yelp can be very deceiving.   Based on some of the outstanding reviews about this place I was expecting quite a lot walking in. I was surprised at how cramped this place was; it can probably seat 20 at any given time. I was there during lunchtime, and thought the long line would at least be a marker of food worth waiting for. I was mistaken. Before I describe how underwhelming the food experience was, though, I do want to acknowledge the serving staff that was very attentive and friendly.   The food on the other hand, was so underwhelming that I was tempted to give this place only a single star to correct it's misleadingly high Yelp rating. I tried the classic burger. I ordered it medium, and it came out completely well done. But that wasn't even the biggest issue, since there are many places that sell overdone but serviceable burgers. This place, on the other hand, insists on serving large half-pound slabs of gray beef atop boring buns with minimal toppings. The burger itself seemed to lack any seasoning, let alone a sprinkle of salt and pepper. If not for a squeeze of yellow mustard, I might not have eaten more than a few bites. The fries were not fresh and equally underwhelming.   The chicken and waffles is okay, but when you serve something as simple as chicken and waffles, it needs to be spot on or unique in some way to stand out. Here, the waffles are like anything you'd find at a Holiday Inn breakfast buffet, and the fried chicken is hot and crispy but a tad dry. The smotherload is okay, but lacks acid and freshness, and the steak I ordered medium with the burrito also came out overdone. The multigrain protein pancakes here taste okay, but let's not kid ourselves, they don't taste any better than a hot stack of normal buttermilk pancakes at your local Denny's (or a location on the Las Vegas strip).  The price of the food itself is the last nail in the coffin, and with such a lackluster 11 dollar burger, I struggle to see what others rave about in their reviews. The food itself looks good and is certainly very photogenic, making it perfect for Yelp reviews, and the concept of the restaurant is pretty awesome, but poor execution overall really prevent me from giving this restaurant any higher than two stars."}
{"text":"I tried to write the SkinnyFATS directly, but that is not an option on their website...So yelp will do.  I have been going to this location for well over a year. Almost every day I buy my crew lunch, and for a long time this was one of our preferred places to go. Because they are good, and we were not the only ones who thought so. Every month they would be busier, and busier. Not a bad problem to have. But unfortunately, in that process they do not seem to be able to keep up with what is happening in house. After several unpleasant to go order experiences - Orders with wrong, items missing, having to wait a REALLY long time we decided to give them some time to get a handle on this level of success.  Yesterday, for the first time in months we decided to try SkinnyFats again. At 11:10AM placed an order for 6 items and we were told it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. I was skeptical of that timeline, as it has not been my experience but I went in after 30 minutes hoping the food would be ready. I was wrong. at 12PM I asked one of the stressed out servers when my order would be ready. She seemed so irritated that I would even ask. How dare i???  She let out a huge annoyed sigh, then looked out into the dining room and said \"we are really busy\" and walked away with such hostility. I was actually taken aback. I FINALLY got my order at 12:15PM. Over an hour after I had placed it, and with not even an apology.   Even after months of hoping they could figure out how to adapt to the level of business, this place is still total chaos at lunch time! And it makes me sad that I have to tell me staff that this place is off the choice list, simply because they cannot figure out how to run the business in a way that actually takes care of the customers. All of the customers, not just a few."}
{"text":"One of the most overhyped spots in Vegas, it's small, u always have to wait long, and the food is just solid, nothing close to next level status. I've given it numerous tries and I can't figure out why Vegas gives this places so much props. I've also brought out of towners here and they never say how awesome it was. There's a million better options in our beautiful city"}
{"text":"I've been here everyday since this place opened on the WESTSIDE!! As soon as I walked in I was super HAPPY! :) the decor is amazingly fun and upbeat and instantly puts a smile on my face!  Everything on the menu is fabulous! My faves are the Wrap Supastar and SteakNation....... and favorite juice here is Mr Green!  Love this place and I highly recommend it to everyone......Super healthy!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"There are three menus. Skinny, Fats & SECRET. (The secret menu is really bad for anyone who should be seriously eyeballing the skinny menu!) hense, the secret part. ;) If anyone gets their knickers in a twist because an item is on the website or the video wall, but not on the menu- just ask. It might be on the super secret menu your wasteline doesn't want you to know about...hense, the secret part!  It is my husband's fav. So we visit only in moderation.    I have been here 3 or 4 times. It is a little pricey, but worth it now and then. I wanted to try everything on the Skinny menu, but on the 4th visit I got a very bland chicken rice dish that I really should have sent back or asked about. I have not been back sense.   The vibe in the NW Location is very upbeat. The food is very good. We love the quaint community setting and can't believe we had driven by it so many times without ever realizing it was there!   Look for the faux Hedge to the East of Best Buy across from the Costco Lot."}
{"text":"Love this place! Me and my bf are regulars here, while I like to try new things on the menu, my bf orders chix on the broadway all the time, and I can see why. The chicken in the burger is so tender and just so perfect and the buns are sweet and just delicious. So far I like everything that I've tried!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their food. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because when we order from postmates, they seem to always forget our juices with the order. This has happened twice. I've called and each time it's \"oh yeah we opened the fridge and saw them in there\" they were nice and courteous and offered free cookies both times. I just wish they would check that the order is complete BEFORE handing it over to the postmates driver. :/ other than that, super great."}
{"text":"This location is much larger than the original, I love the open air design much more comfortable seating and a beautiful patio area."}
{"text":"Talk about a great gem of a restaurant, great for breakfast and lunch. First detoxed with one of their great juices, which they produce off property. Second we ordered the steak eyes which were nice medallions of filet mignon done chicken fried steak style over jalapeño corn bread and gravy - so satisfying.  Also had the egg white scramble with turkey bacon, fluffiest egg white scramble I've had-just wonderful!  Dishes run 10-13 dollars so expect to pay a little more than $15 pp."}
{"text":"Omg first time here it was amazing!!! Collin and Jackie had the best customer service in Vegas :) so friendly the food was so yummy the salt and peppers shakers so cute I bought 2 sets :)"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try SkinnyFATS for a very long, long time but never got around to going! When I saw a location had opened in my area, I pretty much decided it was destiny & marched right over there. After dying over the yelp pictures of the tu-nuts, I decided to try that and ohmygod. It was genuinely one of the best things I have ever eaten. Fresh, tasty & simply amazing. Truffle fries: also yum. Delicious food aside, the restaurant itself has such a nice atmosphere and the outside patio is awesome. Also, the staff was incredibly attentive & friendly. I was also really happy to hear other customers in the restaurant talking about how much they loved the food too. Major kudos to you SkinnyFATS!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is AWESOME! I come here at least 2x a month. Very friendly staff. Great atmosphere. Ralph gives us great recommendations each time! Overall, Its one of my favorite local joint."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I tend to go more for the FATS menu and not so much the Skinny.   I've been here over three different times and I have yet to write a review for SkinnyFATS, so this is way overdue. During my visits here I have ordered the Cherry Popper, Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis, Vegwich, Flat Chix and Greens and all the fries!Seriously everything I've tried has been so amazing and full of flavor. Some of the highlights are the Vegwich & Cherry Pooper.   The Vegwich is a skinny menu item and is filled with Portobello mushrooms, avocado, cherry/banana peppers, spinach, tomato & horseradish yogurt all on a grain toast. Finally a healthy sandwich that will actually fill you up and not leave you looking for something to snack on in about an hour. I normally get this with side of truffle fries. A true Skinny FAT styled meal!   The Cherry Popper is a spicy all beef burger topped with cherry/banana peppers, spicy slaw, pepper jack and a fried egg on a Hawaiian sweet roll. Do I really have to explain why this is so tasty? Just re-read above and then try one for yourself. Great burger for a first timer to SkinnyFATS, get it?   Chicken and waffles, amazing salads, and juices! This place really has it all including a cool vibe and look. Vegas is filled with cookie cutter eateries with mundane surroundings, which is why SkinnyFATS is so refreshing on both your eyes and your palate.  PRO TIP: Before leaving buy a bottle of their house made Jalapeno Ketchup. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats focuses more on the experience of your meal than the actual meal itself. The arrangement of the place is small. So small, in fact, it seats only about 30 people at a time which gives limited personal space between you and other customers. Although the food is slightly overpriced, it is good quality.  If you are looking for a unique and different place to dine with a couple of your friends (the biggest table only seats 6 people), then I recommend SkinnyFats. The overall appearance of the place is trendy from its vintage decor to its alternative music, giving it a fun vibe for you and your friends."}
{"text":"I was a little sketched out at first cause I didn't know what a lot of the things on the menu was and it was pretty amazing when I was at the table one of the servers came up to me and said if you don't know what your looking at you can go on our website and see pictures of anything your thinking about ordering and he said we're pretty diversified about switching out different things to fit your choice of meal. So the staff was excellent, and then I got the \"Flat-chick salad. Was so amazing for something healthy. I would definitely come here again, the environment and setting around was great! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome.....  A must try is the Tuna Taco's!!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is probably one of the best places i've ever ate at. i have never been the kind of person to type up a review until i ate here for the first time today. they've got good food and good music. the vibe and environment of SkinnyFATS is very inviting and i highly recommend everyone comes here. i noticed some people were saying they're expensive and sure, they might be a bit pricey but you're also paying for your experience here. i promise you they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Definitely a great addition to the North! Ordered Chix on Broadway- Tasty chicken sandwich but going more adventurous next time! The pressed juices are great and the \"Liquid Defense\" is delicious! Just the pick me up I needed to battle the winter ailments! Service was great, even though they confused our order a tad- But Hey! it was their first day open so I could cut them some slack! Overall- great vibes, great food, and great people- Welcome to the neighborhood SkinnyFATS!"}
{"text":"I've eaten there several times in the past few weeks and thoroughly enjoyed my meal each time.  The menu has a skinny side (healthy/lower calorie) on the left and a fat side (indulgent/comfort) food on the right.  Normally I'd opt for the right side but I'm trying to eat healthier until I pass my next doctor's physical.  So I've only eaten off the left so far but everything has been really tasty and satisfying.  Zucc-it, zucchini spaghetti w/ a spicy arrabiata sauce (144 Cal) and the Teriyahi, which is a teriyaki tuna poke and tomato sandwich, are two of my favorites.  I also really liked the Caulifire appetizer, which is roasted cauliflower tossed in Buffalo sauce.    The place is usually packed at lunch time but the line progresses fairly quickly.  The service is very good, with Will and Kathryn standing out in my mind.  Their motto is \"Live Happy\" and I usually am when I leave there."}
{"text":"We had the adobo hobo taco, piccata piñata taco, and vegwich. They were all very flavorful, but a little too spicy. We had to drown it all in ketchup to actually be able to eat it. It was also very zesty and all three dishes seemed to have the same type of flavor.  The customer service was good, but the food was okay."}
{"text":"Honestly The best Chicken and Waffles I have ever had. Price is good, and they give you a big portion of food. Service was fast, place was clean. Everyone there is super nice and friendly. If you are in Vegas I recommend you stop here. Food was AMAZING! The Chicken sandwich was super crispy and everything looked fresh."}
{"text":"Everyone loves SkinnyFATS, so you gotta come see what's up.  Plenty of parking at this location. Order food at counter, and they'll drop it off at your table for you. Decor and staff are both great for good vibes.   The downfall? It's hard to be decisive about what to order (as exhibited by myself and other people lingering the back without actually deciding yet), and people have a million questions when they get to the counter. It can take a long time to order your food.   If you're like me and love savory AND sweet for breakfast (the ultimate indulgence), have one person order the churro waffles with Nutella and share food! (While this is a meal of pure sugar and fat, oh my goddddd you need at least one of those crispy waffles if you're gonna come here!)"}
{"text":"Good eats at SkinnyFATS, no matter where you go in Vegas.  This one is a tiny little place near the south side of the strip, so unless you are confined to the strip for your vacation or trying to save money on Ubers, I would recommend going to another SkinnyFATS to get your grub on.  The nice thing about SkinnyFATS is that everyone can find something to eat, whether healthy or indulgent. Everyone gets what they want.   Parking shouldn't be an issue... the only struggle is finding a spot to sit when it is crowded!"}
{"text":"I've repeatedly visited this location with my family and enjoyed most of their food on those visits. However, tonight's dinner was less than stellar. My first problem begins with their high prices. Way to overpriced for the food you receive. I ordered the Apollo fries as my dinner this evening. It looked delicious and very promising: sweet potato fries, chicken, arugula, dried cranberries, and feta cheese. What I received for $10.00 was a bowl full of sweet fries, 3 small pieces of chicken, literally 3-4 cranberries, a sprinkling of feta cheese, and barely any arugula. Super disappointed to say the least! Had I known what I would be receiving I would have just ordered a side of sweet potato fries for $3.25. After tonight's disappointing meal, I'm sad to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is small... Plus it's not typical American breakfast. I had French toast with weird jelly. My girlfriend had white yolks with turkey bacon. Go someplace else to eat"}
{"text":"It was my first and last time here.  I ordered the Agave BBQ chicken and it was tasteless, the rice was undercooked, no flavor at all."}
{"text":"Skinny Fats is awesome! I love the concept of healthy food and comfort food options on the menu labeled healthy vs happy. The food is fresh and delicious, high quality and presentation is wonderful. I would give 5 stars but the seating is super limited and the space is crowded."}
{"text":"I got the most gracious response to my review, I will definitely be back and ask for the vegetarian menu. The staff was wonderful, I did not ask for a vegetarian menu and I see now that was my error. Knowing what I know now, I certainly wish I'd asked. Perhaps having it out along with the other menus might assist others like me who assume that the posted menus are the only option.   I'm excited to hear that you're adding vegan options. Hopefully gluten free as well? Many folks who want gluten free don't really need a dedicated kitchen but choose not to eat gluten for other reasons (thyroid health, or maybe just because they think it's slimming!) etc. For example, I'd have eaten 10 cookies or bars or healthy desserts if they were vegan and gluten free. I'd pay through the nose for them, too. I want to eat healthfully (not added oils and mostly raw, organic, plant based whole foods) but healthy sweets are something that I love, too. Just a few thoughts from a plant based whole foodie.   Kudos for posting a response that was both thoughtful and kind. I'm impressed and will be back with my whole group and recommend to others as well"}
{"text":"Random place for a restaurant, however don't mistake that for a complaint.  What a concept, SkinnyFats. It's like the angel on one shoulder telling you to eat a salad or some ahi tuna but that devil on the other side is like \"NO, CHOCOLATE BANANA PANCAKES, NOW!!!\" I fairly waited to write this review til I had dined off both the skinny, and the fat side of the menu. Although the skinny side is excellent and has tons of options of just about everything the fat side does, I still prefer the fat side. Even with the salads! The Aphrodite wedgie was freaking amazing! They recommend add tuna for protein but I added avocado instead. Still great. I'd pass on the truffle fries again, but my boyfriend liked them. He got the Philly that comes with huge portobellos, mushroom heaven! My second visit I had the cheeseburger Benedict and it was a solid, home cooked burger with fresh veggies and egg. It exceeded my expectations actually. They also offer a cucumber water, love when places do that!  There are also skinny and fat juices, shakes, and floats. Everything from a hangover helper, to a orange fanta float. Honestly, there are no way the creators of this menu weren't potheads. Creativity at its finest put into action. Well done.  The only downside is parking your car, then parking your butt. Finding parking is rough, then getting food and dining in, even harder. Especially during lunch hour. If you do find a spot, there are people lingering over you, waiting for you to get up. I'm thinking outdoor dining in this area may be prohibited but would be a great idea if allowed.  Other than that really nothing bad to say. I have also heard they have a secret menu and daily specials.  I really like that they embrace diversity and let the employees be themselves as well. The owner of this place seems awesome, and I hear from a secret birdie they have chosen a new location for expansion. Nice!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I do highly recommend Skinnyfats investing in a food warmer. Our food (and this happens every time I go with my wife) will be sitting on the counter for 10 minutes getting cold, we timed it this time. We always watch our food just sit there , and when we get our food: it's cold, bread is soggy, and it really ruins the meal.   One of the servers there (Stephanie) was extremely rude. It is 3pm and there are only 5 tables occupied, it is not busy at all. When Stephanie brought us our soggy cold food, she did not ask who's food was who's, she just set it down like she couldn't leave fast enough and snatched the number off our table. And to make things worse, she grabbed utensils and literally tossed them on the table half behind her back since before she could even bother to properly set them down she was already in a hurry to walk away. She didn't even look at us and yet our food was the last order, and new guests hadn't even walked in yet when she walked away so we aren't sure what she had to do that was so important that it became okay for her to just toss our silverware across our table."}
{"text":"This was the first time I have ever tried skinnyFATS. The building itself is clean and really nice! I didn't realize you go to the counter and order/pay there for your food. I thought it was more restaurant style. I ordered the Berry Strong, a protein waffle with a strawberry chia jam, fresh berries and an orange flavored agave. It was okay. I'm super picky about my proteins so I feel the waffle could have been a smidge tastier. The orange agave is SUUUUUPER sweet. I probably won't order that next time. I also got the skinnyFATS Punch (minus banana) and OMG it was pure heaven!!!! I will go back and try other items they have but for me, the Berry Strong was a Berry Wrong. I really wanted to like it tho."}
{"text":"So happy they opened a place in SW right next to my house. Both the happy & healthy sides of menu have items that will make come back time after time. Also follow in ig for secret menu items daily. A smart local place doing everything right. Only bad part is parking in sw location. They need a bigger lot for the demand."}
{"text":"Just for service this place is 5 stars!!! Came here with my vegetarian friend and we ordered a lot of veg dishes.   We ordered Zucc It-if I were on a diet, I'd eat this more. Full tomato flavor.   Black bean burger-Really delicious and full bodied flavor. I think it was spicy too! Also had avocado which helped with the dryer black bean burger.   Cauli Fire-so good! This is the item we order all the time. Super spicy buffalo sauce. I ate this then the black bean burger so I'm not sure what made my mouth the kick.   Truffle fried and sweet potato fries-obviously both were delicious. My 2 yo ate both but favored the sweet potato fries.   Also ordered the HangOver juice which my friend really liked. Coloring is beet red."}
{"text":"Quick look: solid little restaurant in an industrial neighborhood on Dean Martin facing the I-15. If you can find the place (look for busy parking lot), than you will have a quality, reasonably priced, fresh meal.   In depth review: SkinnyFats has a solid buzz on the streets on Vegas with the locals at the current moment. Decided to try it last Tuesday and I am glad that I did. Really cool and hip casual vibe inside. Felt very comfortable and the staff was really nice and welcoming. Could tell they liked working there.   I order the \"Cranburky\" (Turkey Burger) (($10)) off \"The Healthy Side\" w/ a side of sweet potato fries and the lady ordered the \"More Cow Bowl\" (($11.25)) off \"The Happy Side\" of the menu. In addition we ordered an iced tea and a fresh squeezed orange juice. The total was about $30 for he both of us. Sat down and it took about 10 minutes for our food to arrive at the table. They will bring it out to you.   First impression is \"Wow!\" They give massive sized proportions. I had a giant plate of fries next to my turkey burger. My burger was amazing. Could taste every fresh ingredient and it was not greasy or messy at all. One of the better turkey burgers I have had in town. Will order this again and I highly recommend it. The sweet potato fries were stellar and very tasty!  The lady had the Teriyaki filet bowl and said the meat was delicious. She had a complaint that I can vouch for as I sampled it. The fried rice in the bowl was wet and soggy. Too much juice from the meat and veggies and it ruined the taste of the fried rice. Could do a better job straining the fluids before they add the meat / veggies. Actually turned bowl upside down and strained a good amount of water from it right at the table. She still ate and enjoyed it. We had enough left over for a second tasty meal. They give you a lot!   Juice was also steep in price. $8.50 for a 24 ounce OJ is a bit much. That's my opinion.   But overall SkinnyFats is out to a great start. We will go back and try it again. Maybe this week?"}
{"text":"It's really good! The menu is unique and the pricing is fair. The Chickawaffadopolis was amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for the longest time and finally decided to go with my friends. I have to say that the exterior and interior of this place is truly unique. There is art painted all over the walls and there's mirrors surrounded by a tin like design when you look up. The only thing I have to say that sucks is that the restaurant only seats around 30 people with not a lot of space between tables.   Skinnyfats has a healthy side and a \"happy\" side on their menu. They also have a wide variety of beverages. Everything is pretty pricey for the amount you get when it comes to snacks.   I found out that this place had a secret menu. I looked it up and decided to get the Steak and eggs. For a total of $14 this meal comes with slices of steak, potatoes, eggs, and toast. I am so glad I got this dish because the portion was huge and everything was delicious. The steak was so juicy and tender and there was plenty of it. The potatoes were also a hit. The only thing bad about this meal was the desert-dry toast.   My friends all got something different and they paid too much to receive so little and or a mediocre plate. The Acai bowl didn't have much Acai but a ton of granola. My friend got a sandwich and rice and it was all sorts of bad. The truffle fries on the contrary were cheap and tasted great. You get a big bowl of them!  If I could, I'd give this place 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I went here with fellow Yelper Marie to see what all the hype was about. It is a tiny place that can get packed and VERY loud during peak hours. I ordered a green drink, salad,and TBLT- all for 20$ including tip which seemed a tad bit expensive. The green drink was refreshing, but that was the end of the wow factor for me. The salad and sandwich were just that. Nothing super exciting or different tasting than other joints that I have gone to that promote healthier/lighter menu options I didn't think Skinnyfats was bad, it just wasn't great enough to make me give up my usual spots."}
{"text":"I gave the SkinnyFATS location on Dean Martin 3 stars and I was happy to visit this location on Warm Springs and give it 4 stars. Hooray for some breathing room while I eat. Yay for the option to eat outside. Yippee to not rubbing elbows with the person next to me while waiting in line. Now, the tight parking spaces is another story.. The menu is great to include breakfast, smoothies, cold pressed juices, sandwiches, salads, and some unique dishes and meals that are on the healthy side and some that are a bit heavier. Call ahead and get it to go if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"This is truly my favorite go to restaurant anytime I want something to eat. It has the express experience for food on the go and a very fun atmosphere if you want somewhere to relax and grub. As a vegan I really appreciate the menu! There are several modifiable options as well as plenty of already vegan dishes to eat. (My favorite is the naked chix, sub out chicken with Portabella mushroom and of course no cilantro sauce!) It's the perfect venue because my little ones aren't vegan, so it makes it easy for everyone in the Fam-bam to enjoy a meal together without cooking 4 dishes!  My last and favorite part of dining at SF is the service! Even before I was a regular, everyone was super amazing and friendly! They remember your name and dishes you like, they stayed aware to my vegan needs and warned me against anything not suitable for my diet! I love the staff during breakfast or dinner, they're all superb! Service is a 10, food is a 10, and even the juice bar is incredible! LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"I love skinnyfats and been eating at this resturaunt for some time but this location is my favorite to eat at because of the friendlyness from the staff and outstanding costumer service. Kayce does an excellent job at keeping things together there and making sure everything runs smoothly! if you're looking for great food and amazing vibes all around I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting or even anyone who lives in vegas"}
{"text":"The best spot!  Great food and drinks.   Make sure to get some cookies too.   The sodas are amazing. Fresh juices too.   Standouts include the cheesesteak, burgers , and breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Drove bye it many times. Had a dental appointment near bye so I thought I would give it a try. EXCELLENT  Great tasting food, Great friendly staff and Great coffee. I will return."}
{"text":"This place is fcking awesome. Been to the Dean Martin location several times, always killer.  Came here on day 1, got the blazewich, simple and derish, my hubby got the cherry popper always a favorite with truffle fries (so yum). But the soup! Spicy Latina may be the best soup I've ever had. I love soup. It's SO hearty!! And the spice! The flavor! Perfect! Glad skinnyfats came to my side of town! And of course, glad to have a beer with dinner."}
{"text":"My family has been to the skinny fats on Dean Martin and were excited to see a location on our side of town. We decided to stop in on a Thursday in hope of a smaller crowd, but to our surprise it was still very busy. We waited about 15 minutes in line to order by the time we ordered we were lucky a family had finished and were able to sit at their table since seating was scarce. My kids ordered shakes and hamburgers. My husband ordered the big parm, and I ordered the nice to Greek you. My kids burgers were the first to arrive to the table along with the big parm. We waited an extra 15+ minutes for the kids shakes which by that time they had finished their dinner. All while I still waited for my flatbread. I honestly thought they forgot my meal but later Alana came to our table to apologize for the wait and refunded my entree. I was hoping they would of worked out their kinks by now but will probably wait a while before we return."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is addictive.  Seriously.  I ate their ahi tacos once a week for three months straight.  Now I'm hooked on their chicken sammich.  I'm so happy they have a location near my workplace!"}
{"text":"I'm actually quite sad that the consistency of the food has changed since they became really popular.  At first, I would order delivery for work and it was on time or early.  As the weeks passed, the delivery times got worse.  One order was skipped over so we waited an hour passed our set deilvery request time.  Today, the order is 30 minutes late and counting as I write this review.    On top of inconsistent delivery, the last order we did was pretty  bad.  It was as if the food was pretty much dumped into the boxes.  The burgers came tossed around and the tacos were soft and not crunchy.  It wasn't tasting all that great.  When we ate in the next day, it was okay.  I'm crossing my fingers that today's delivery tastes and looks better.  I really hope that the consistency for delivery times and food quality goes up from here.  If not, there's always another burger and taco joint in town."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! My fiancé and I were looking for a quick place to go to breakfast before we left to go back home to AZ. I'm so glad we stumbled upon this place! We are for sure going to make sure to stop here every time we drive though. Like, it's THAT good. It makes me want to cry that there isn't one in Arizona. The one thing I would change about this place is to get a bigger space! it was crowded in a small space and it was hot in there! but the food made up for it for sure. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for the weekend, and over he course of 3 days, I had three meals here. They are definitely known for their breakfast, but their other items are just as delicious!  For the first day, I had their special fried chicken eggs benedict. It was waffle, fried chicken tenders, poached egg, shoestring potato, some delicious house made hollandaise concoction, and syrup. I literally died and went to brunch heaven! I pairs this with a healthy cold press juice that made me feel better about the decadent meal!  For the second day, I tried their s'motherload burrito with a side of truffle fries. Wowsers! You gotta try their housemade ketchup...the Chillpotle and Unipeppercorn are both amazeballs! I came home and immediately ordered some for me to drench myself in the privacy of my own home! I got a fancy smoothie called Charlie Brown, and I just wanted more!  For the third day, I decided on lunch...and had the Spicy Latina (chicken tortilla soup) and the Naked Chix (mango basil chicken over jasmine rice). First and foremost, everything I've ever eaten here has been served piping hot...which is how I like my food, not lukewarm like it's been sitting there...but it tastes like it was hot off the grill! The soup definitely had a kick to it...and it was delicious with so much goodness inside. The Naked Chix was a fantastic rice bowl of healthiness! Perfect lunch!  I can't wait to come back over and over and over again! They're always busy, but the self-serve tables turn quick, and the employees are super duper friendly! This place makes you want to be a nicer person...and I even went out of my to be extra nice to other guests. Love everything about this place!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious. My wife and I stopped in here after getting our daughter shots at her pediatricians office. We ww re looking for a place that was open at 9am, and we came across this place with amazing reviews, and pictures.  Inside we were greeted by a very friendly staff member Dannielle. She explained that the menu has a healthy side and happy side. Happy side is naturally less healthy.   I got a delicious burger, the meltdown. It was amazing. My wife got the smotherload, a breakfast burrito with sausage and steak. It was amazing.  We also shared two turnip tacos from the healthy side, they are steak tacos with amazing flavor.   I would come here again and again. Great experience. Friendly staff, and great food....  Come here and come here often!"}
{"text":"Love this place and everything we have eaten here. Favorites are Tu Nuts, cluck moo, Bradway Chix...but everything is yummy. From the delicious sodas to the decadent breakfasts...and some of the skinny items are awesome! The cookies are delectable, too."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal is about this place.  Yea, their ads on facebook look good but it's too bad the food taste doesn't match.  I got the meltdown and it was just okay.  Not very flavorful and I've had better burgers similar at bars.  Maybe I'd try it again for the breakfast but nobody in my group of 6 was very impressed."}
{"text":"The dopest! Always something chronic to eat at SkinnyFats! Their juice definitely has the squeeze!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been our go to place when we want to eat out but still remain under our daily allowed calorie intake. With the healthy side available, we were still able to enjoy the taste of the happy side with just better, healthier alternatives.  It's kind of a hit or miss here in this restaurant. One time I ordered the chicken and waffle and the chicken was so dry it turned me off to the whole dish. I tried it again the next time just to see if there would be a difference and it was cooked better than it was the first time.   Everything I've tried on their menu so far, either on the happy or healthy side, has been satisfying and rarely ever disappointing. 4 star for the overall concept of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Easily the best food in Vegas and I have eaten everywhere.  Better than the buffets, healthier than subway, and more protein per dollar than anything else you will find in the area. Jocelyn and the rest of the staff make the entire ordering experience super pleasant and easy. I would highly recommend you all eat he"}
{"text":"Very good prices, Splendid customer service, Food was amazing and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"At first, I was a tad bit confused about the location. Hidden little gem, surrounded by businesses so I suppose it made sense. Its relatively small... Very colorful decor with dim and comfortable lighting. This place was BUSY, way too small for the customer base... Definitely not enough seating. However, my boyfriend snagged a table as soon as we walked in... YES!! Since it was our first time here, we were a little confused about how to order. There was a server serving the food and a counter with a register. We weren't sure who to order from... After asking, we figured out how to order: first from the counter and then the server drops the food.   The menu is a simple front to back menu. Separated: a healthy side and a happy side. We both ordered from the healthy side:) my boyfriend ordered the chicken and protein waffle with sugar free syrup, it looked pretty darn good. I ordered the buffalo cauliflower( small portion maybe four and a half whole pieces of cauliflower) for us to share. It was spicy and delicious. I ordered the portobello sandwich made vegan with no sauce and a side of rosemary hummus. It was so delicious!! Perfect amount of veggies and the bread was toasty and not soggy. The side of sweet potato fries were suppose to come out with truffle oil, they didn't but they charged us for it. My side of hummus was also forgotten and we were charged. Other than the cramped seating and a few forgotten items, this place was great.   The service was knowledgable and the young cashier was very thorough and sweet. Everything made the receipt, just not the table. We will definitely be returning, possibly trying the other location with friends since it wasn't very group friendly."}
{"text":"Maybe it's a generational thing.  This place was very busy at 3PM in the afternoon, didn't really see anyone there over 45.   I shared \"The Hot Mess\"  which is exactly what it is and  in every sense of the word.   Pretty much a Nacho with Buffalo chicken bites, cheese and spicy sauce then sprinkled with  jalapeños .... better suited as'Bar Food\"    I did take home a Goat Salad, which was very good.  The steak pieces on top were very flavorful and perfectly cooked.  I'd try it again, but wouldn't go our of my way to go there."}
{"text":"Traveling to Vegas often it's really hard to find a healthy but yummy breakfast joint and look no further we found a winner    The decor is cool and hip with all the wood accents and they had an outdoor seating area if you had pets or wanted to hangout in the 100 degrees temps in LV, ha!   The menu is easy and pricing is reasonable, it's setup like a cafe so you order, get a number and sit your booty down. The server will deliver your food and it's a self serve for drinks and silverware but that's okay if you are trying to eat healthy you can get you steps in!   We ordered:   The Wrap - very taste and would order this again!  Openface Omelette - super healthy with egg white and tons of protein and veggies!   Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"I've been going to skinny fats for a while now normally at their first location so when this one opened up by my house I was so excited! Been here a couple of times but keep forgetting to review it.  The menu option is different and I'm sad that some items aren't at this location but other than that it is cute, small and still really good. Staff is always so friendly and I love the little patio seating area. Uploaded some photos of what I get and I give it 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good breakfast options and both locations are hopping at lunch. Diverse menu options makes it easier to order in lunch for the office."}
{"text":"My new favorite place to grab lunch. Everything I have tried has been beyond delicious."}
{"text":"We just stumbled upon SkinnyFats by accident. Immediately upon entering you notice a very laid back and happy feel to the place. It's very reminiscent of some coastal areas in California. There's is a walk up counter where you order and can get your drinks which include a number of delicious smoothies (served in reusable cups; a little nod to Mother Nature there), coffee, and beers ranging from PBR to Delirium Tremens. Talk about a range! Cucumber water is available gratis at the drink station.  Then there's the food. Split between two sides of the menu, one healthy and one decidedly not. There's something for everyone, and so far it's all be fantastic. Great staff, fun atmosphere, and always enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"great place to get your grub on, friendly staff and chill environment.  If your looking for something different, you've found it!"}
{"text":"everything I expected, this place is a hidden gem but thanks to google maps I made it before I got \"hangry\". there are so many items I'd like to try so I'll definitely come back more than a few times. the service was great, the food was as good as the pictures looked and the cost wasn't bad at all. if you like trying new flavors, new ambiances and have it served by excellent service come check them out."}
{"text":"I went here in December for the first time. The food was delicious and it's very affordable especially considering the great quality of the food they serve. It had a trendy vibe inside and the staff was very friendly. The only issue I had was that my friend and I ordered shakes before our food and hers didn't come until after her meal and mine didn't come until half an hour after my meal (even after reminding the staff a few times) I was surprised they didn't offer to refund the shake, or really seem too bothered by the fact that I had to wait an hour for it. Hopefully it was just a fluke! I'll def try them out a second time to find out."}
{"text":"Very good very different. Great for healthy eaters and one's who don't count calories. Kind of a hipster place. Think of Starbucks if they opened a restaurant."}
{"text":"I tend to visit Las Vegas occasionally and I have learned the best places are away from the strip and Skinny Fats is no exception.  The Chicken and Waffles are awesome, but if you want something healthy they have plenty of good smoothies, and plenty of other options for your palate.  It is a bit of a ways from the airport but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Chicken Parmigiana off the secret menu.  Side salad was the bomb.  Please bring this restaurant to Northern California."}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere! There is something for almost every taste here. There are vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options... and of course options for the non-calorie conscious, lol! The chickpea curry had a really nice spice, and the shrimp tacodillas were AMAZING! I just wish this place were bigger, because it does get packed"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is a hidden gem and you really have to be looking for it to find it. Either way it's totally worth it and it's semi off the strip, but worth every minute you are eating their food!!   The non dairy ice cream floats are to die for. I've had their salads, fries, and other things and everything has been over the top good. I would go here every time I visit Vegas if I could."}
{"text":"Came to this place on a sunday morning. In a unexpected offices area plaza.  The place is pretty small and we had party of 8 but thankfully people come and go quickly so all of us get to sit down and eat. You order in the front of the counter and sit down with your number.   The Menu has two sections skinny and fat!   We ordered cinnutella, steak and egg, and cookies.  Cinnutella - -Nutella french toast with some fruits, got this unique texture between a cake and cookie but then it gets soggy with the nutella sauce. I think it was a bit too sweet but still very tasty.  Steak and Egg - Steak was nicely cook medium rare but i guess i prefer poached or sunny side up egg, something that has running yolk in compare to their scramble egg which was a bit dry for me.   Cookie - Got peanut butter and chocolate chunk cookies. Chocolate chunk cookie was on point! the chunk was so big and the cookie was not too hard not too soft, very buttery. Peanut butter cookie was very peanut buttery and good but it was a little too rich.  Overall, I really like the atmosphere of the place and the food is good especially the cookies!! Def a good place to go for some brunch after a long night. so I will def come back and try some more."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the chocolate chip cookies are to die for best cookies ever. They employees are so fantastic!  Fonzia has given me the best customer service I have ever received ...  I am in the industry and I LOVE GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"Good spot. The family really likes this place. Fun menu, nice warehouse feel to the restaurant. We had two skinny entrees and two from the fat side. Both were very good. And that's why we keep coming back."}
{"text":"Customer service is top notch!  Food is DELICIOUS!! Try it out.  The food was BOMB and the drinks were great.  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place has, without a doubt, one of the best menus in vegas. They have something for everyone (vegans, vegetarians, anti-gluten, paleos, and your regulars). I am vegan so I had a small, yet, nice selection to choose from. Best of all, they have multiple locations and all of them are off the strip so you won't be bombarded with traffic or sweating over how much parking cost.   I have been here a few times, but on my recent trip two weeks ago, I ordered the \"stuff on curry bowl.\" AMAZING!!! I finished it in about 3min flat. The flavors worked so well together and all the ingredients were really fresh. and I would have never thought to put curry sauce on top of pasta noodles (rice noodles). I need this recipe ASAP.   This is a must experience while in vegas when you're tired of the same ole overpriced bar food and junk food on every corner."}
{"text":"Nice venue and great food choices!  The reason I am not giving the five star rating is because one of the employees was wiping her nose with her hand and she did not wash them!  Ewwwww.  Nice place to hang out and have coffee or have a full dinner too!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is a hidden gem! This place is so GOOD! I forgot that i was even eating \"healthy\".   Its pretty busy on weekend mornings/afternoon.."}
{"text":"Used to be great, until they didn't seem to know what serious allergies or cross contamination means during prep/cooking. Found pieces of other food that wasn't part of my meal in my meal . Not impressed and I will not be a returning customer. Not worth a trip to the ER for anaphylactic shock ."}
{"text":"Very Cool! I have been there few times and I like it! Innovative and different style. the location its a little wired, but I would drive to there.  Most of the items of the menu are awesome.  whatever you pick, you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"hipster burgers are cool i guess. I liked the steak sandwhich they have. Good quality for sure."}
{"text":"Overrated in my opinion.  The place was cramped and the food is overpriced and not all that. Next!"}
{"text":"I've been to SkinnyFats twice, once at each location, and I've had to leave both times since there was no place to sit. I gave two stars since I never got to eat. Not sure if I'll go try again, at least any time soon.   Finally came upon the opportunity to eat at SkinnyFats again, and this time around they did NOT disappoint!! We went during the week, at night and it was busy but not packed. We walked in the door, waited for the couple in front of us to finish ordering and were then greeted by a most helpful gal. I had my eye on a few things, she helped me boil it down and made recommendations. My husband ordered The Classic and I ordered the Filet o'Fire, both with truffle fries. We also ordered the 3 types of cookies they had freshly baked, to go: blueberry lemon, salted caramel, and chocolate chip.   The Filet o'Fire was FREAKING FANTASTIC!! I can't imagine ever having a better steak sandwich ever, for as long as I may live. No exaggeration. It was spicy, the filet was cooked to perfection and very tender, the bread, oh my God the bread....toasty, griddled perfection. I begrudgingly gave my husband a taste. He also said it was the $h!t.   My husband said The Classic was super delish, I wouldn't know since I never came up for air from my own sandwich.   The truffle fries were damned good!! Next time I may try the sweet potato fries though, just to mix it up.   And now, the cookies. SWEET LORD, THEY ARE MANNA FROM HEAVEN! The salted caramel cookie is the absolute best thing I've ever stuck in my gullet....I mean, besides the Filet o'Fire. Seriously.   I'm so very glad I tried y'all again!! Y'all pretty much own me now!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. We came around 7:00 o clock into a mostly empty place, I have never ate here before so I didn't know if we sat ourselves or got in line but we stood standing there awkwardly two boys were behind the counter but didn't acknowledge us, we ended up asking them if we seat ourselves, he then told us you just get in line: The concept is super cute you have one side of the menu listed healthy and the other half listed happy. They have a little bit of everything here for everyone's tastes. I ordered the healthy bleu balsamic which was a really simple spinach salad with steak and the caulifire which was a 10! The caulifire tasted like chicken wings. My friend had the mango chicken bowl and the shrimp boat, they were both on the healthy side. I would definitely come back and try other things. I don't think I got the best thing to eat but I'm open to returning."}
{"text":"After working up an appetite down the street at Sky Zone Trampoline, we stopped by around 3pm on a Sun.  We figured we beat the rush and there would be no one there.  We were mistaken.  This place is the spot.   Every table was full and there was a steady flow the whole time we were there.   The place reminds me of Cali - fresh ingredients, modern, and great food with tons of selections between fresh made juices, smoothies, sandwiches, salads, and breakfast items.  Thanks to Yelp, we ordered the secret off the menu Chicken and Waffles.  It wasn't your standard traditional soul food with meat on the bone.  They were more like tenders but it was delicious and we ate every bite of it.  The chicken held perfectly with the slightly crisp waffle.  There are more secret menu items - just check out the online website before you go...Shhhhh  We also ordered the Bonjour Brulee, egg white french toast with bunch of berries and turkey sausage.  It was part of the healthy breakfast section but it certainly made us feel like we ordered from the Happy section.  Last I had to get an order of the Slaw Chee.  Anything with my name in it such as Cheeburger Cheeburger, I HAVE to support.   The Slaw Chee tasted just like it should - the perfect amount of texture from the cabbage with the perfect symphony of flavors.  It was a little hot....it was a little sweet.  it was addictive just like a Slaw Chee should be.  We will be back - this place is great!"}
{"text":"The entrees were impressive looking as well as tasted great! So impressive that felt the need to write this while I was eating. The New York chicken fried steak was not over cooked with a hint of pink and the over easy eggs , were exactly that. My girlfriend's Chicken over Broadway looked more impressive than my dish but both were great and we'll be back! ."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Went right at 9 am on a Saturday so we walked right in as the first customers. It wasn't long before the place was full. Food was a little pricey for adult meals but not outrageous (i.e. Not as bad as on the strip). But after eating, my husband and I both agreed that we felt we got our money's worth and will return. Portions were good size and the food came at the correct temperatures. Got chicken and waffles - very tender chicken and very flavorful (not just average traditional chicken strips), and the Smotherload burrito - filled with filet cooked perfect medium, as requested. Coffee was good but I didn't see if they had free refills. Got two kids meals too $4 and $5 and the quality was great. Decor fun and fresh if not a little hipster. A little tight though; don't try to come with more than 4 people. We had 4 plus a high chair and we were kinda crammed."}
{"text":"Amazing salad (had the Thai Cobb) and super friendly team. Outlets at every seat on the counter. Fantastic place to sit, eat and work away. I'm eager to get back here and try other items on the menu. Seating area is coffee shop size, not full sit-down restaurant sized."}
{"text":"I love the concept! Think about how many times you've wanted to eat with someone who just wanted a salad (LAME) and you wanted to be a little more exciting! This place has something for everyone. My husband and I stopped here on the way out of Vegas and I will be back on our return. This place is great. The service is great and the food is even better. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love coming to skinnyFATS. I've made myself a regular lately. Each time I go I have tried something new on the Healthy side. I also love their lemonade, not too sweet. They are always quick about their service & when I phone in my order it is always ready at the time they have specified. I have yet to be disappointed with anything I have tried. My only complaint is I would love to try their fresh juices, but I feel like they are a little on the pricey side. $9. Maybe one day."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday and for the most part was not disappointed at all. The staff was super friendly and helpful, so in my eyes that is always a plus. The menu had a lot of different options that could please just about anyone that walks into the door. The decor was what caught my eye the most. It was inviting and very interesting and just made me feel like I was at home. While the pricing for some things were a little high in my opinion, the quality of everything was very good.  Food  CauliFire - 4 Stars - Needed a little more Cauliflower & a little less Buffalo Sauce One-Eyed Monster - 4 Stars - Just needed a little more seasoning. Bomb Diggity - 5 Stars - Nice Size Portion, Tons of Flavor Chocolate Chip Cookie - 5 Stars - Served Warm which makes all cookies better Chocolate Strawberry Shake - 4 Stars - Needed a little more Strawberry flavor Strawberry Lemonade - 4 Stars - Needed a little more lemon/berry flavor  Overall a very solid restaurant and will be back to try some new dishes."}
{"text":"Skinny Fats is that kind of restaurant you keep going back to, because everything on the menu is great! The pink lemonade is perfect and their salads are yummy. This place itself is a bit small, but they have moved to a different location so compared to the original location, it is slightly bigger. Great place for lunch or just to have a meal. They also have items that are not on the menu, so be sure to ask a team member to point those out."}
{"text":"Vegas Family trip !    Great place to eat with friends and family ...wasn't really sure what to expect never heard of this place .  Trip with the family can be tricky to find a place with good and unique food. This place has both an the family was pleased .  Some of pick the happy side and others had the healthy side ..we BOTH win YEY!!   We are coming back on our next family trip."}
{"text":"ummm no, first took too long to get our food. then i get it and it doesnt even look like the picture i sent it back and they threw an egg in it. the taste was bland and i just did not like it at all. i got the cherry popper, i wouldnt recommend it. im very dissapointed, besides tasting nasty it costs $40 for a breakfast burrito and a burger. horrible."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I had a chicken sandwich and it was the best yet. Also, their cole slaw is so good I may need a 12 step program to curb my affinity for it.   Joint is small. Kids menu was well received by my shorties. I hear it is crazy busy and I can see why. Looked like they do a decent take out business. Highly recommended. Oh I ate from the fat and happy side of the menu"}
{"text":"I like  the food, five stars, but the last three times I have felt the service was just above a fast food order by number place   Tonight the family and I went. We ordered at the counter and our food came a while later. I have two kids and they always order the clucky toes. Kids grabbed a table and wife and I ordered. I ordered their clucky toes with plain fries.   Food comes and there is only one order of clucky toes. I told the server we are waiting on another order and a minute later the cashier (Asian female with an attitude) comes over and says \"you didn't order two orders of those ) and drops the receipt on the table to show me. To her   Credit she read the order back to me when I paid, but I could not hear her so I just said \" sounds good\". There was a crying kid right next to me in line.   Here is where it went south. I have ordered for my kids for the last 10 years. I have never, not once, forgot to order for one of them. In fact, when said Asian female with attitude took my order , she said \"you want plain fries in both of them?\"  It was almost like I was made to feel like I was trying to cheat the system the way she accused me.   Maybe a better approach would have been, \"I'm sorry, I checked the receipt and there was only one order paid for.\"  But it got worse.   I told her, well I need another order as my daughter has no food to eat and I pulled out cash to pay (I am not trying to cheat the system and am happy to pay if an order was not charged for ).  She walks to the kitchen and asked the chef to fire another order because \" he forgot to order them\".   Listen, I am not cheap, I pay for my stuff, but maybe some training for the staff would be nice. There is an easy way to not accuse anyone of forgetting and still get to a happy outcome     I've been here prob 20 times since they opened in Sept, and have never forgotten to order for my kids.   Next time try the , I'm sorry it looks like only one was billed\" approach.   I also think the food is not as good as when they opened. I'll come back, but for for a while"}
{"text":"Late night needed a post workout meal after leg day. 1/2 hr to close...made a Convenient mobile order, picked up, done!  Try the secret menu's Happy Mess and sub the truffle fries for truffle sweet potato fries! Smothered with shaved NY strip, bleu cheese and pico! Mmm! Fuel    I'd suggest a meatless option with tofu or baked cauli or chickpeas ..."}
{"text":"First time trying SkinnyFATS, they have healthy and not so healthy food. Good vibes but it was packed inside on a Sunday at 10. The staff is super nice and the food is yummy. I'll be coming back to try the other options of food next time. SkinnyFATS punch comes in a cool cup. It was amusing. *attached picture* Got a side of truffle fries for $3.95 expecting a small order but it was a full bowl of fries   Tip: Find a table first then order. First come first serve."}
{"text":"Stopped by with some friends for a bite to eat, never been before but the vibe is cool. You have to go up to the counter to order which was new. I had the hot mess nachos there were pretty good, nothing too special. The service was fast and the lemonade was freshly squeezed!"}
{"text":"The pictures just don't do it justice. Be sure to check their Facebook page for the monthly menu items."}
{"text":"I've been to SkinnyFats a few times and everything is always so amazing!   I've had the following and hopefully I can post picks of it all:  Drunken monkey pancakes (these are a MUST HAVE); Smoke in a bowl (this one okay just very bland); Chix on Broadway sandwich (was really good); Sweet Cheese Us' (Amazing!!!) and Bleu Balsalmic (I'm not a tomato fan whatsoever but this was beyond delicious)."}
{"text":"We came at 11:00 to beat the lunch rush.  It almost worked. The 5 or 6 minutes we waited in line were definitely worth the wait.  We had several appetizers because we couldn't make up our minds. we had the gobball which is a turkey meat ball.  It was very bland but the flavor was good.  We also had pimp shrimp and it was okay but the shrimp was a typical las vegas buffet shrimp with very little flavor and inadequate seasoning.  The spicy cauliflower was awesome with a little mouth burn.  I had a patty melt that was wonderful and she had the sweet cheesus and said it was very good.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  We were impressed with the menu and will definitely come back for another try."}
{"text":"Skinny fats is THE place to be. I literally come here a minimum of once a week. To begin with, the vibes are awesome here. All the employees are extremely friendly and upbeat and it's definitely refreshing. My two favorite menu items are 1) The Meltdown & 2) Buff Chix. The truffle fries that come with these two menu items are to die for. It's got like a Parmesan cheese/basil/garlic type flavor. If I had to be extremely critical, dining area is a bit small and also I disliked that they don't have any water other than their cucumber/lemon water but that 10/10 will not stop me from coming here. I look forward to my weekly meal at skinny fats. In fact, I just came from there today and had, yet again, another enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"This place is so bomb that I went twice in a weekend! It's an \"order at the counter, grab your number, and seat yourself\" type of place, so if you have a large group, I recommend getting there earlier than peak times.   The salted caramel cookies are TO DIE FOR. I ordered several to take home to share with friends! In addition, the garlic fries, Berry Strong waffle, and Blueberry Yum Yum French toast are terrific options.  Friendly staff makes this place a go-to. I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFats has a great energy and positive vibes. Lots of both healthy choices and indulging savory ones too. The staff are always friendly, especially the ones taking your order. They're always smiling and helping guide you through this one of a kind menu."}
{"text":"After reading great reviews from yelp and friends I had to come over here and try it for myself! This was the second time I came here, the first time we ended up leaving because of seating there was no room and the bf didn't want to sit separate since the person didn't want more over couldn't have a person in between us on the stools.. Anyways today we got here a lot earlier than last time around 12pm and I ordered a Chix of Broadway with sweet potato fries.. I loved it! This place is worth coming back every meal they carried out I saw and was like man I should of ordered that (lol) but I will be back to try out more of their foods on their menu!"}
{"text":"We had fun dining here in August 2017; stand in line order your times, find a seat and start chowing down! We ordered: 1) Cherry Popper Burger: husband ordered this and said it was quite good. glad we made it out here to this burger joint 2) TeriAHI Sandwich - I had this; felt healthy and tasty too. glad I ordered it, would get again and the portion size is more than enough for 1 person  Staff are friendly too! :) hard to find seating, probably best if you look for a table first before you order haha."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, phenomenal service. I love all types of food, I am a personal trainer and group fitness instructor and I eat healthy very often. My friend ordered the fried chicken blt and it was bland and my bowl the \"smoke in a bowl\" was quite bland as well- even after adding hot sauce. I would come back again to try something different- however at this price point I expected more flavor."}
{"text":"Good burgers.  Unfortunately, they forgot to bring the sides with the burgers.  All was right when a free cookie arrived with the sides."}
{"text":"Oh wow! I used to huff my cookies all the way to Dean Martin to eat the best of Vegas. Now I drive 5 minutes! Can't say enough about the food or staff. Always fresh, always the best. Thank you Skinny Fats!"}
{"text":"Usually I don't go to any food spots that my brother recommends because he's prefers portion size over taste. He recommended SkinnyFats and I begrudgingly decided to give it a try. So glad I did. Y-U-M! The menu is trendy American food with a twist and it is delicious. I ordered the Healthy Wrap Supastar. Everything was cooked perfectly and I could have inhaled a tub of that cilantro lime yogurt sauce (licks every finger). My brother had the Chickawafadopolis. I didn't get a chance to taste the waffle but the fried chicken was that perfect bite of crispy-juicy and a hint of sweet from the maple syrup- Yesssss!  I definitely credit SkinnyFats for restoring my faith in my brother's choices in life...I mean food :)"}
{"text":"Time for lunch with wifey after cardio work-out this morning. Gotta eat a little healthy but stay satisfied. So...Skinny Fats is the restaurant choice today. She got the  \"Smoke in a Bowl\" off the Healthy side of the menu. I got the \"Happyness Bowl\" off the Happy secret menu side.  Kinda busy for 230 pm on Saturday. But we found seating after ordering. I like eating here because it provides \"healthy\" and \"I really don't watch what I eat\" options....so the food arrived in these wonderful bowls to dig into. I immediately put some Jalapeño-Ketchup on my food. Shredded NY strip steak-fries-pico de gallo-bleu cheese crumbles & cilantro. I went to town on this bowl. Delicious.  Hit the spot for my appetite. You won't regret this choice restaurant. There's always something here to eat for every diet."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and seem to order the same thing: chicken and waffle.  This time the chicken was a bit greasy-don't like greasy fried chicken. The waffle is always good.  It's an \"order and seat yourself\" and they bring it to your table-works well. It's usually busy but can always find a table in this very casual establishment.  The atmosphere is lively and you can also dine on the small outside patio when it's not 100 degrees.  The Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I will try something different to experience more of the unique menu next time...perhaps."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. We had Wake n Bacon. Delicious!! A little out of the way but worth it. We were looking for something non strip. We will go back."}
{"text":"I am a regular here and food is always amazing, had a little issue which they immediately took care of thanks to Lana.  Thanks again."}
{"text":"This is place is delicious! Love their food concoctions and home made cookies are a must! I love how they have a healthy and happy side. The workers are all super nice and helpful to explain the menu and help me choose a great meal because everything looks good here! Prices are reasonable for all the unique dishes they came up with. Omg their flavored ketchups are sooo good.. my favorite was the jalapeño ketchup, the perfect amount of spicy with my delicious meal. Everybody should eat here!!!"}
{"text":"In town for work and grabbed lunch. Cool concept and good food, but the reviews made this place sound incredible.   The truffle fries were alright. Light truffle flavor so tasted pretty normal. The balsamic steak plate, which I can't remember the name of, was exactly what you'd imagine it to taste like.   Wasn't disappointed, but def not five star worthy in my opinion. Staff was very friendly and environment was welcoming."}
{"text":"Good food. Very small space. I ordered the meatzza flatbread which was delicious, my boyfriend had the teriyaki ahi sandwich. Ended lunch with a chocolate chunk cookie!"}
{"text":"We ordered the chick humm to go along with a create your own shake. The shake was great, it always is. However, the chick humm was not up to our expectations from photos and online introduction. The overall flavor of the burger lacked seasoning, and the bun was soggy by the time we got home. The chicken was also pretty dry. It was not to our expectations. We've been to skinny fats many times before and haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"5 stars! There is nothing bad I can say about this place! They have a healthy side of the menu and a happy side of the menu.  I always vary it up between both sides. The sweet cheeseus is amazing. Chick a waffledopolous is to die for and they have healthy and happy shakes. This place is for the average eater the healthy eater as well. They also serve breakfast all hours of the day.  I have to give it 5 stars because there's nothing wrong I can find with this place."}
{"text":"Best Healthy friendly place in town, check out the app and secret menu online for more amazing foods ! Great for most Diets like Vegan, veggie or Ketogenic and Paleo ! I highly recommend this place if you want a guilt free feast"}
{"text":"I love this place! There's two sides of the menu; the healthy side and the happy side. If you're looking for a place to eat healthy and fully satisfied, this is the place. The variety of sauces that's available is really good too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely for all my ladies and gentlemen out there who are \"skinny fat.\"  You know the type I'm talking about... You love food and don't know what you would do without it, but hate the extra pounds it adds to your amazing physique.  Yeah, this place is golden for you.   You walk in and are greeted with enthusiasm from the staff that works there. The decor is bright and cheery and one of the walls even boasts, \"live happy.\" I can't imagine not being happy when walking into this place. The menu can be a little overwhelming because it is quite jam packed, but make sure to read it through before placing your order. You don't wanna order something in a rush and miss something you could really love.  I ended up going with the Chickawaffadopolis (basically chicken and waffles). It was AMAZING. The chicken strips were perfectly crispy and the waffle was delicious. My friend got the Cranburkey with a side of truffle fries. I stole some of her truffle fries and they might be some of the best I've had here in town.   I also went with one of their coldpressed juices: the Summer Quench (cucumber, celery, Apple, and lemon) and it was great!! I really enjoyed it and would definitely get it again.   I think what I honestly enjoyed the most was the friendly atmosphere the staff treated the guests with. The person at the counter was amazing and super helpful since it was our first time. I will definitely be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot. The chef here is the best. Definitely worth a trip there anytime you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is definitely a healthy option during a Las Vegas trip. I choose the happier side, because of the bad decisions last night. The rest of my table choose the health side of the menu. All of them were tasty and low calorie."}
{"text":"First-timer and everything was amazing, from the experience to the food. Greeted very promptly and asked for drinks immediately to start since there was a line ahead of us. Wasn't too hungry at the time, so I ordered the Turnip Taco and Ahi Srirachi. Served on wheat tortillas and are the size of the average street tacos, but filled with a whole bunch of goodness. Definitely recommend this place to the food addicts out there."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this place.   They catered my wedding and the food was absolutely delicious. I will forever dream about their fattening tortellini carbonara....mmmm. Everything that I ever had though was pretty spectacular and working with them was wonderful. Reed is a great guy and made it all look so easy!   Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for amazing party food or even if you want a tasty bite to eat. I love that their menu is split up into skinny and fat, such a unique idea, and I also love their new location. A really lovely upgrade from their previous establishment.   Can't wait to return next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with this place! Can we say Love At First Taste??! A friend of mine talks about this place all the time and today I was down to try a new place! Sure glad she introduced me to this exclusive cute little spot! Prior to arriving I was already doing my research on yelp looking at past reviews and pictures of my fellow yelpers! I could tell there were PLENTY of food choices and the menu was pretty extensive! Upon arriving when we walked inside the venue was a bit packed and kind of tight. Plenty of people working and taking orders. I wanted a burger and was suggested to try out the cherry popper ($12)  and also got one of the Ahi Tacos ($4) friend got \" A Boat To China\" everything came out fantastic and in a very good turn around time! I will be sure to return as there are so many more items on the menu that caught my eye! The pictures posted don't do justice for how good this place truly is!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't wrote a review on this place and I've been at least 5 times! Any who l have to let it be known that this SkinnyFats happens to be one of my favorite neighborhood places to eat! I really love the fact that they have this whole thing going on like one side of the menu is \"fat\" and the other side is \"skinny\"  It almost makes you second guess yourself on which side you want to eat on lol. Either way I can honestly say that you can't go wrong with ordering anything on the menu! I have almost tried every option they offer and have been extremely impressed with everything! I also would like to mention that they usually offer these weekly deals of different dishes that aren't on the menu! The Slow boat to china and any of the Ahi tacos are my favorite! I can eat them almost everyday! Also I recommend trying any of the cold pressed juices they offer as well!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Las Vegas SkinnyFATS was at the top of my bookmarked list. After looking over the menu I was intrigued by the protein pancakes. Not many breakfast places offer this type of option.   My protein pancakes may have been packed with healthy ingredients but like another reviewer said I was hoping for more health information on the pancakes. Are the protein pancakes on the healthy side because they are high in protein and rich in nutrients? Made with whole grains or oats instead of white flour? The pancakes were tasty but I could barely finish one because they were  dense and heavy. I did not like the turkey bacon because it was too salty and I am not a huge fan of agave syrup in general because I just think it is too sweet. If the pancakes were less sweet it may have worked better but because the pancakes were sweet on their own I could not eat it with the agave syrup.  On my last visit I custom made a 24 oz shake with strawberry, frozen yogurt, kale, and banana. The shake tasted sour but not in a good way. I could not make out the kale and overall it was a sour tasteless banana strawberry smoothie.   After looking over the menu and tasting a few of the items I am not sold on the healthy side of the menu. I think most of their healthy items lean more towards being fat free, low calorie, and sugar free. Some of their breads and tortillas are listed as wheat which can refer to anything that is wheat and usually has the nutrients removed. None of which are healthy or valuable to the body."}
{"text":"I got the fried ny steak, biscuits and gravy. damn that's on the happy side far away from healthy.  We also ordered the veg-a-bowl (i think that's the order name), it was decent.   good food, unique place, unique looking menu, i'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"nice flavors.  the veg-wich was very tasty. i may get that sometime even though i'm not vegetarian"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!!  I love that this place is off the strip and tucked away where not many people will find it. Staff is awesome, cheerful, and helpful. You order at the front counter and the menu has a great ( and super tasty) variety. Everyone in our party enjoyed their meals.  Another perk was the quickness of service. We didn't have to wait long for our food and everything was super fresh!  Check this place out on your way home from Vegas! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"So good. I had to order two things. The cranburkey Sandwhich was delicious. The the sweet potatoe fries that came with it, best I've ever had. Be prepared to wait in line. This place is busy."}
{"text":"Perfect restaurant combo..... Finding a restaurant that works for my family is hard. Hubby is not the healthiest eater and me and the kids try hard too be. Well today we decided to take the nephews who are home from college out for lunch and yelped healthy options. This place came up and from the moment I found out they had a healthy/happy menu I knew this would be great. We ordered from the healthy side skinny Q pizza( gluten free), slow boat to china, Cobb salad, hot mama and from the happy side chicken on Broadway w/ truffle fries, cheese burger Benedict w/ sweet potato fries, Kids Chicken and fruit. It satisfied all of our appetites and made our tummy's happy. My husband after trying mine and our kids food said he come and eat off the healthy side next time. There was so much flavor in everything we ordered.  We will be back...."}
{"text":"Love love love the food here but the DeanMartin location is so tiny seating is cramped and if is during a busy time like lunch the noise level is off the charts. Worth the money for sure and again the quality of food is amazing just try and come at an off time to avoid the crowds."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Sweet cheese us and ahi tacos were favorites for us but everything was good."}
{"text":"I have no idea what's the hype about this place, food was expensive and not memorable"}
{"text":"Always a delight to go here. A hidden gem. Healthy bites are what attract me to it - I only wish there were even more truly healthy options, and slightly better bang for the buck. Suggest integrating lentils, quinoa, and more super food veggies."}
{"text":"Finally out on the other side of town and remembered I had SkinnyFats bookmarked so we had to go. They are in a business type complex so it's a little bit of a weird spot but their sign is easy to see and they have an a-frame out on the curb too.   While the menu is a little confusing at first, there's two sides to it and I'm sure it's already mentioned but here's the rundown. The left side is the skinny/healthy side and the right is the fat/happy side. Each dish is featured on both sides of the menu but done in a different way to fit the theme. I thought that was awesome!  As far as food goes, it is killer! I had the chick-a-waff-a-dopolis (chicken & waffles) which is a \"secret menu\" item and my wife had the wedge salad, we also shared a side of Hot-Mame (edamame). All of it was great, super flavorful and they definitely aren't skimpy with their portions. The wedge salad is huge and ingredients were fresh. My one and only complaint was the chicken was slightly overcooked...but the flavor definitely made up for it. They also have a good selection of juices, smoothies and such but we opted for a passion tea which was really good.   All in all, we loved this place and can't wait to go back! Cool concept, cool atmosphere, cool food...oh and the employees are excellent!"}
{"text":"My loving & lovely sister brought me a Skinny Fats breakfast last week consisting of an amazingly good Southern Fried Filet Mignon, eggs, sweet green chili cornbread and a jalapeno sausage gravy that is to-die-for. I CANNOT stop thinking about how incredible it was. My bf is now jealous of the chef bc I keep talking about asking him/her to move in...  #skinnyfatsfanforever #ohmahgah #scrummy #weneedoneinhendersonplease #bigfanofthechef #durangolocation"}
{"text":"This like an ultimate cafe for fatties like me and my healthy friends. Half the menu is more health conscious and the other half is more gut satisfying. How can you go wrong? The menu is small, but they do concentrate on a few good eats in each category - making it just right for when you can't decide on what kind of food you want. Juices, shakes, smoothies, burgers, pizzas, waffles & breakfast items, cookies & pastries, salads, coffee, all jam packed in this small discreet location in the southern part of Las Vegas away from all the resorts. Whoever thought of this restaurant idea is a genius!  Had their Waffle Mountain High & Cheeseburger benedict. Odd pairing but dang they were good. Brunch for dinner? Haha!  My friends and I got there before the dinner rush which was perfect timing. When we finally left, the place was packed and people were standing waiting to get seated. I can't wait to be back in Vegas to try more items!"}
{"text":"this is one of my normal spots I frequent that never reduces its quality in service and food. when I first started coming here, not many people were here to wait to order. however, I'm super happy they got as popular as they have. good quality no matter what you order from their happy or healthy side is usually always delicious. I've tried a lot of things from their menu, but my favorites include the smoke in a bowl with quality chicken, medley of veggies and rice wrapped in a delicious aioli, and the cherry popper burger with truffle fries. their steak items are always cooked perfectly in temperature to order as well.   staff is always quite friendly and willing to help if you want to try other things. overall, fantastic little hole in Egypt restaurant aha."}
{"text":"That this place has some awesome food becomes clear fact once you see the plates piled with food move past you. Then the menu, with a very unique layout, can make you sit there reading it over and over again, painstakingly trying not to order everything on the menu.  It's also super apparent that they don't have enough floor space here. You have to line up to order your food at the front counter, with no guarantee of finding a seat...the chances of which aren't very good since this place is packed during most of its hours of operation. I can't imagine why they have such a small place, as they could do exponentially better by providing more seating for their patrons.  My recommendations: the sweet potato fries are to die for. Remember to get a SkinnyFats soda cup, since you can get cheaper refills when you bring it back on a future visit. Any sort of fish taco here is also amazing."}
{"text":"Update alert.... Slow Boat to China... Smoke in a bowl Yo! ....this place is awwwwweeeeessssoommmmme!"}
{"text":"OMG the best burger on Earth. ....   cherry popper.... And the Ahi tacos stupid good stuff... Too 5 spots in Vegas"}
{"text":"Place is original! Great food and service was good! Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Skinny Fats is a fantastic place to grab a great tasting healthy meal!!  Service is always spectacular!!  And the variety of fun food combinations really hits the spot.  If you like spicy they have a few that will make you happy.  Like the Shrimp Tacodilla and a great burger like the Cherry popper!!  The other great thing is that they are really close the VGK practice ice in DT Summerlin.  So they always have the game on !!!  And they got beer!!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is tasty. Portions are nice and so is the staff! I've been here for brunch and near closing time. The didn't rush me out. Food was just as good as if I were here at the top of the morning. The only thing that would make this place better would be having a few lights out front... Ok never mind, there are lights out front but maybe a neon sign that reads Skinnyfats! I'm like holding up traffic on Dean Martin looking for a damn smiley face on side of the building."}
{"text":"It was a long wait to get to the front. One cashier only and when asked they admitted that if they had sent out the food quicker, there wouldn't be space to be seated. My food was good, but overcharged. One of my friends disliked her Ahi dish. I wasn't full after my bowl (more moo) so I ordered a wonderful choc chunk cookie. $15 for lunch-no drink. Lot's of veggies."}
{"text":"Always have great food here.  They have free cucumber water. Super yummy truffle fries. They have a healthy side to their menu & a \"happy\" side. They're usually pretty slammed & seating can be tough. I've had to sit outside a couple of times because inside was packed."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price, just wish servings were bigger or you had less menu options sometimes"}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG   I was mind blown! Hubbies best man said let's goto this place becuase it was like a healthy portion that he could have compared to our decision of going to robertos tacos....  Walked in and the decor was so awsome! Very chic and stylish and laid back. You just feel care free and kind of keeps your eyes constantly busy. Everything seemed refurbished like using crates to build high counter chairs and just pieces if wood painted to decor the walls and create the benches on the cute little patio. They have an open kitchen to be able to see all the delicious different foods that come out along with being able to see all the kitchen staff work so hard and still be happy ahahahaha.  Me being me i couldn't just try one thing coming into dine somewhere for the first time and I definately thought it would be more resteraunt style where I could sit and study the menu and after seeing the pictures of the food I totally thought it was a sit down resteraunt, but boi was i wrong! You first order at the he register and then they deliver the food to you and you get to grab your own drinks.  This place has 2 different concepts which is absolutely AWSOME for me becuase a lot of my friends are very healthy and i just am NOT! They have such a variety from SMOOTHIES....COOKIES....BREAKFAST....SHAKES....KIDS MEALS.... DESSERTS...SOUTHERN....AMERICAN....ASIAN...THE WHOLE SHABANG! Luckily we had three people in my group so what I ordered didn't seem too extreme if it were to be just me and hubby but this is what we did  CHICKAWAFFADOPOLIS $12 * must say I was quite impressed with light batter on the chicken & the waffle was thick fluffy & crispy  REDICULOUS $11 * just the right amount of sweetness & some fresh fruit to cut through the creamy cream cheese frosting  WTFRENCHTOAST $10 * friend had this & it was the least of my fav.  HAPPYMESS  $10 * this was ORGASMIC addiction in my mouth with so many different flavors especially with the add on of a sunny side egg & Bleu cheese with diced tomatoes  ONE-EYED MONSTER $7 * creamy gravy goodness with a sunny side egg & some bacon strips  PIZZA-WAFF-ADOPOLIS $11 * just a pizza on a waffle... a twist of a pizza  LIQUID DEFENSE $8.50 * definately more on the healthy side   PEANUT BUTTER COOKIE * they bake it for you!!   STRAWBERRY-BANANA-NUTELLA SHAKE * love it but I only WISH that they had WHOLE MILK for the fatty side of people like me hahaha  They also have different kind of soda which aren't Pepsi or Coca-Cola which is unique  This was my first meal of the day and it was a Kickstart to an awsome day & I will definately be back to try many more new items along with the ones I have tried as well !!"}
{"text":"Really cool place with a lot of unique dishes. Filet mignon truffle fries and chili garlic edamame are bomb. They have the best buffalo chicken fingers I have had in Vegas so far and the pineapple teriyaki rice bowl is real good and filling as well. Highly recommend this place if you are a foodie like me."}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant like this before and I was a little skeptical. But man it was amazing and loaded with flavor. I had the special loaded Benny with rib meat on it. Omg it was so good! We will be back there for sure. Wish there was one on our side of town. Northwest Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for awhile. Finally I convinced my friends to try something new with me. I was a little apprehensive at first because the seating was a little odd. We ordered our food and oh my goodness! Nothing else mattered! The food here is sooo good! We ordered a couple different things on the menu and were not disappointed. We typically don't drink soda but I would definitely recommend trying the soda here! Specifically the black cherry coke. We could not stop drinking it."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here and it was great. Love the healthy options. And the cookies in the case looked so good we took 2 to go! Yummy!"}
{"text":"The food was good, however my intention on coming here was for the velvet waffle or acai bowl. Neither of which they make anymore. The customer  service was good, but some of the customers there were upset with having to wait for a seat. It's a small venue, if you're not patient, you can easily get upset with having to wait in line."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great service and good but oooooomg get a bigger place. Standing up to eat isn't my thing!"}
{"text":"So my tough reviewing husband went out to lunch with a friend to this location of Skinny Fats last week. When he came back in the house I thought he had lockjaw. He sort of had a smile but his jaw was locked open as if saying \"I can't believe what I just ate\".  He finally got his mouth to work and he described having shrimp that was in a hollowed out cucumber with some of the most amazing restaurant made spicy catsup. This was the Shrimp in a Boat.  So, last night after we went to see the movie Get Out we drove over to the same location on Dean Martin and I was really impressed by the dynamic menu. I just had to have the Chickawaffadopolis which is delicious fried chicken tenders over a buttermilk waffles with syrup and wow. It was really good!  My husband ordered the Steak Eyes: biscuits with the steak medallions sort of a dish and biscuits with 2 eggs. Our friend enjoyed a dish with zucchini noodles called Zucc It. It looked so delicious, and it was gone in a flash!   Iced tea was perfect. This is a great place and we are lucky to have 3 of them in Vegas, so I hear.  Staff are very helpful with questions, and our food was delivered quickly. I think you will be as eager to try out all of their wild and fresh menu items, as am I!!"}
{"text":"Ordered online so I could pay and pick up when I get there. I get there and wait in line 10 minutes after it says the order would be ready and they still weren't ready to have me pay yet. So I wait for another few minutes to pay and then wait a few minutes more before my order was finally ready. I ordered a hot chix and a T.A.T.S. In my special instructions I said to sub the Bleu cheese for pepper jack which I've done countless times and also to sub the avocado for more jalapeno strips instead. I end up with just a regular hot chix with Bleu and avocado as well as no salad dressing at all on it. What's the point in having a special instructions section when you aren't going to read it at all? Go to SkinnyFATS, but don't ever bother with ordering online."}
{"text":"I ate here again recently. Again, very very good. Top quality quick sit down food. Even the dishes that I thought wouldn't be good are delicious, like when you try a bite of your husband's disgusting sounding order but you end up wanting to order it next time for yourself. They have their own line of soda too. The Birch Rootbeer is really really good. It's like a spicier regular rootbeer. If you like rootbeer try it, you will love it. The price is a little higher than some near by places like Robertos and the such but you are paying for quality. They really are a great, unique restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the amazing strawberry and cucumber shake. The cashier was knowledgeable and excited to share other offerings on the menu. After I mistakenly asked for \"ice\" instead of yogurt only to realize once I started drinking it that it was ice cream, they kindly replaced it for free for one with frozen yogurt. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Very cute and quirky... Small but really such a hidden gem in terms of local eateries. The food was fantastic and so were the fresh juices. We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is great for everyone. Take time to read the whole menu. Also, if you don't want to leave your bed, give them a call for a quick delivery."}
{"text":"awesome place! great decor, great environment, tasty sandwiches and smoothies."}
{"text":"We love skinny fats!! Very original menu and very friendly staff. We like b9th locations. They do a lot of specials that aren't on the menu which we like, and I like that they involve their customers in naming menu items."}
{"text":"Really great environment. Loved the art in the walls and the area itself had good vibes and felt very open and welcoming.   We didn't have to wait long for our food. We received it our meals in about 5 minutes. The waitress serving us was very polite and cheerful.   Came here for brunch. I got the Blueberry Yum Yum which is French toast with blueberry jalapeño jam. Sad to say it wasn't much to my liking. I think it's more of an acquired taste but still glad I tried it. My boyfriend got the Chicks-On-Broadway which is a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Pretty good meal.  I would definitely come again. There's a lot of choices and unique options I've never seen before."}
{"text":"First time in, actually found a place to sit.   Tried the Sweet Cheesus sandwich with truffle fries. Very good, just the right size for lunch. Wife had the SkinnyQ and loved it. Will definitely come back, hopefully quicker than it took to get here for the first time.  Highly recommend, stop and try'em...worth the wait."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! Will definitely be back for sure!!!!!  We got the Buffalo cauliflower, ahi tuna cucumber, and a steak sandwich"}
{"text":"Do you want some place that you can go to with your girlfriends where you don't over analyze the menu to see if it fits in your diet? How about a place where you can feel good pretending to get a cheat meal in when actually the food here is healthy as hell. Well skinny fats is just the place.   The menu of this place changes with the season so don't be surprised when some of your favorites change. There are different seating options as well as I like to change what environment I am eating at. The food is really well portioned and comes out pretty fast which I think is impressive for a busy day when I came in.   I am not even that much of a health nut but I kero finding myself back at this establishment because the food here is so delicious. I also feel like they add extra care into making their food which is a difference you can taste. Either that it it's the fresh ingredients that they use. Regardless of what it is, the food here is amazing. So if you're in the mood for something healthy, or even if you're just hungry for sind amazing food, skinny fats is the place to be."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and the service is great! Fonz was super friendly, helpful and a great representative for SkinnyFATS. We had fried pickles and the buffalo chicken sandwich. Both were awesome! Great atmosphere too.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Here's what we ordered   1. Steak Benedicts  2. Berry strong healthy waffles  3. Juan cluck healthy chicken taco  4. Cinnamon French toast  5. Almond milk French toast  6. Green juice  7. All you can drink coffee  8. Berry smoothie skinny fat   My family and I were satisfied with most the dishes. I can't say how everything else was but my family seemed pleased with their dishes.The Benedict biscuits could be a little softer though. They remade the eggs to be over easy. We enjoyed all the other dishes.   My almond milk French toast came with a fruit and chia marmalade and orange agave syrup. It was delicious AND healthy! This is what I call happy food. :)   Super friendly customer service. I apologize to the lady who served us. We didn't have any cash to tip her or we would have because she was super helpful.   We will definitely return here on our next visit."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I eat here all the time. We are the next building over so SkinnyFats is our quick fix for lunch. Glad to see they've added new items to the menu. Looking forward to trying them all out."}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago for my small birthday get together and i must admit... I freaking LOVE this place! It's located in an industrial type area and if you're not really paying attention you could easily pass right by it.   The joint is very eclectic! I love the drawings on the walls and the little salt man at the table. I was shocked at how small the place was. The biggest table only held 4 people and probably had 8-10 tables in total. There is a little bar table that you can sit at as well.   The food was sooo delicious! I ordered the \"Nice to Greek You\" pizza. It has a real strong olive taste...and I'm not a fan of olives...but it was still yummy non the less. Others in my group ordered TBLT and the Cheeseburger Benedict. I will def be returning to this spot!   P.S. I think I feel in love with the salt and pepper shaker!!!"}
{"text":"Very very good food and great atmosphere will definitely come back every time we come to Vegas"}
{"text":"I love the truffle fries and shrimp tacos here. Also my wife loves to get the bennys from time to time if your in the mood for eggs. Wish I could weigh in on the healthy side menu as I always elect foe the happy side! So glad it's less then half a mile away to satisfy all of my brunch needs. Def should give them a try. Feels like a resturant you would see in south austin."}
{"text":"Smooth immunity shake tastes just like an Orange Julius.  I have been craving Skinnyfats ever since my first visit.  The food portions are huge and the shakes come in a to-go cup!  An awesome plus is the naturally flavored water (berry and lime etc) that is free on the counter."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is the best place to bring all family and friends with variety of dietary needs. :) They have hearty, healthy, vegan, gluten free or flat out cheat day meals at a reasonable price. My fav is their Tomato Soup (the best I've ever had) and their grilled cheese combo! Or the Swinetology with Turkey Bacon substitute. Also, they are a few of some places who offer Garlic Truffled Fries!!!  10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Warm Springs/Durango area. I love the fact that the menu is so diverse. There really is something for everyone. I got the Bleu Balsamic which was packed with flavor. The steak was tender and the Bleu cheese provided great flavor. Definitely a must try for someone looking to stay away from a lot of carbs. My boyfriend got the Sweet Cheese Us and it was equally as delicious. The truffle fries were really tasty. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wish we had a SkinnyFATS in our hometown. The concept is awesome. Although the seating area was busy, there was only one person ahead of us in line and we got through very quickly. The cashier was super friendly and even recommended dishes for future visits.   On our way out we got a friendly \"thank you\" and a helpful tip to bring my 32 ounce juice cup back for .50 off my next juice.   I had the Green Mile (basically the juice of a ton of green veggies like cucumber, spinach and kale) and an Adobo Hobo. My husband had the Bleu Balsamic salad. He didn't realize that it came with steak so he ordered grilled chicken. It came out with both and that was okay because the salad was delicious and big enough for me to have a few bites.   The Adobo Hobo is tangy yummy vegetarian goodness on a whole wheat tortilla. The Green Mile juice was just what I wanted - not sweet at all and full of green goodness.  Maybe one day I will try the \"fats\" side of the menu, but it feels so good to eat well. And SkinnyFATS makes that easy to do!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that I am a breakfast burrito connoisseur and that the smothered steak burrito is the best I have ever had. The flavors are incredible! I can't wait to try more of this menu. Thx!!!! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Discovered this hidden gem of a unique breakfast and lunch place while searching Yelp for \" healthy lunch\" in Vegas. Thanks to GPS and the big billboard above it, we found it and had a delicious meal.  Looking forward to stopping there for breakfast on our next trip through Vegas.  They have both healthy and less healthy \"happy\" sides to the menu and do serve breakfast all day (the lady next to us had some delicious looking red velvet waffles topped with fresh berries) . Friendly staff, fast service ( we waited less than 10 minutes for our food, but we did arrive about 2:30 pm). Food was great.  They have vegan , vegetarian and carnivore options. Make their own special sauces and catsup mixes. Order at the counter and they bring you your meal. Self service lemon and cucumber infused water when we were there. It was full even at 2:30.  Will definitely go back to try more of their interesting ( and whimsically named) options. It's small though, not much room for big groups."}
{"text":"Love love this place. The portobello burger is amazing. Try with extra balsamic reduction for dipping"}
{"text":"You really get the best of both worlds here. The menu has \"healthy\" and \"happy\" options side by side on the menu giving you the option to be \"bad\" or \"good\".  I recommend the \"Vegwich\". The Grilled portabello mushroom patty was amazing. The banana pepper add a nice vinegary tangibles to the burger which I loved. I threw some cholula sauce on it to spice it up a bit and enjoyed every bite along with my side of sweet potato fries. Don't forget the jalapeño ketchup for dipping!  My girlfriend had the \"Cherry Popper\" with the truffle fries. Beef patty with grilled onions, banana peppers, and a sunnyside up egg to add to the creaminess. Add the truffle fries on the side and boom! Juicy and creamy goodness. Don't forget the passion fruit iced tea to wash it all down."}
{"text":"The food is off the chain no doubt! The girl at the register really needs to slow her roll. She was in a hurry up let's go attitude. Just hurry up and order get out of my face mentality. By the way this girl at the register had no name tag."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite quick eats restaurant in town! Their options are abundant and the food is delicious. Whether you are looking to indulge or are watching what you're eating there's something on the menu for you! I highly suggest the Buff Chix, Naked Chix, the Cherry Popper, and Truffle Fries are a must. The crew is awesome especially The Fonz! Get skinny or get fat but get in here immediately for some yummy food!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I really should have paid attention  to my gut feelings. The concept of a half healthy and half fun menu doesn't sound like it would work. What I tried didn't work at all. Everyone I dealt with was very friendly and helpful so no service complaints. They couldn't have been nicer. The room is small and cramped. It's a place where you order at the counter, you get a number and they bring the food to your table. As I was waiting in line to order, a waitress was having an argument with a cook thru the kitchen window. She said the order was supposed to be without peppers(?) and the cook was saying that it didn't have peppers. She said she could see the peppers and asked him to make her a new plate. My instincts said to leave. Instead, I ordered a classic burger med rare, a chicken quinoa soup and a coke. I should have left. All tables were full so I took one of the stools along the side bar at the window. The barstools are tiny little things on cylinders that bob up and down as you sit. They are uncomfortable and annoying. The place was busy and I kept getting bumped by people coming and going. That alone ruins the place for me. The soup was brought quickly and looked great in a big cup with herbs on top. The soup was luke warm and bland. It was void of any seasoning. It had lots of veggies and chicken but no flavor and was not served hot enough. The burger shows up in good time and looks nice but picking it up showed immediate problems. The lower bun was already wet from juice. Fingers poked though and it flattened as I tried to eat it. First bite and the meat and veggies slid away, tomatoes fell out. Meat was too rare and under seasoned. Second bite and the bun is totally soaked and dime thin and burger falling apart. I took the plate to the counter and showed the girl the wet broken bun. She offered to make a new one. I was over it, said it was just pathetic and walked out. The food is bad. Either the kitchen doesn't care or cant cook. Seating is miserable. I won't be back. $15 wasted."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars!  We went in for dinner, one of the two cashiers turned around to \"clean\" as we walked in and when the other cashier finished with the order of the customer in front of us, he proceeded to flirt and chat with the female cashier that was actually working and helping customers.  We waited for about 20 mins for THIS. We ordered the same exact meal and received a portion on one that was half of the other.   HORRIBLE SERVICE and employees who don't know their head from their ass."}
{"text":"I do enjoy this place but think it's a little overpriced. I love the shakes and salads though, everything is really good."}
{"text":"a cute kinda hipster type of place with good food at good prices!   definitely wish they had one in LA - they served the type of food I just love.   portions were decent - will not cause you to die from overindulgence and I love that they have a healthy and a happy side to their menu - love the concept!   only wish I got the chance to try more from them."}
{"text":"Really good food!   I love that I can choose between healthy or fattening!!   I've actually only ordered from the healthy side so far (Because everything looks so good regardless!)  And the few times I've been here I really liked the food. Ahi fish tacos are superb and the Acai bowl is BANGIN!  Looking forward to coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Found this place near a temporary job site and it turns out they opened one near my home. Great, because the food is awesome! My favorite is the steak/spinach/bleu cheese salad--and I hate spinach, but LOVE this salad. The Chicken/Mango rice bowl is nice with the cilantro, but has a little bit of a \"kick\" of heat in it. Totally love the \"Charlie Brownie\" smoothie! I could live on those!"}
{"text":"Great food, dope eats, lots of options -- Highly recommend!! I prefer going during non high traffic times as it is a pretty small joint that can get crowded quickly."}
{"text":"I love this place so much every time I have a friend or family member in town I take them so they can have a taste. I go very often and even order delivery food on a regular basis. My boyfriend and I ordered take out earlier today and do the first time I was disappointed. We ordered the Maine wedge, the chicken and waffles and the phatty philly. It was my first time trying the chicken and waffles and they were spot on, best I've had. The Maine wedge was missing dressing and was packaged in the smallest container that it didnt have the same flavor because not everything was distributed evenly. The dressing was the most disappointing though because without it it didnt taste at all as wonderful as it normally is. I also order the phatty philly almost every time and was so upset that I couldn't eat it. They have changed it and didn't mention it and it doesn't say it on the menu either. It now has some weird a1 sauce and peppers. My boyfriend likes a1 so he ate it fine, I however cannot eat it without gagging. I will definitely return but was unhappy on this encounter."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! One of the most unique, hole in the wall places in Vegas! It is in the middle of an industrial park, and you would not see it if you were driving.  Food - Absolutely delicious! They set it up as a \"happy\" menu and a \"healthy\" menu depending on what you want. My favorite is the ahi sriacha taco and the big parm. I have probably been here a million times! Order the sweet potato fries!   Ambiance - healthy and relaxed. Everyone is so nice and always willing to give you a recommendation.   There is limited seating, sometimes the line is out the door. It is definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot to hit on the way out of town back to LA. The staff was super friendly and cheerful at 9am and the food was great. I love their concept of left side of menu is healthy items in the 300-400 calorie range and right side is \"happy\" and tasty. So good for a mixed group that includes health-conscious people.   Hubby had the daily special which was a Thanksgiving-themed eggs Benedict. It was really creative and super tasty. I had the breakfast wrap and that was very good - very clean but could use a little more spice for me so I added cholula which worked really well. Coffee was good too. We'll probably turn this into our spot to stop at on the way out of town."}
{"text":"I LOVE skinnyfats!! Everyone there is so cheerful. As soon as you walk in the door they welcome you. I love the blue balsamic salad. It's always clean when we go, which is why we like going back. The food is great and the atmosphere is welcoming.  Also, try the avocatoast and thank me later. :)"}
{"text":"Food: Not only is the food extremely delicious, but it is wholesome and leaves you feeling guilt free afterwards. My girlfriend and I got:  - Steakation Sandwhich  - Truffle Fries - Ahi Sarachi Taco - Ahi Taco San  Service: The service was pretty incredible. Everyone in there was kind, professional, and courteous. It was very refreshing. Especially after I spent the last two months in Washington D.C where people are quite the opposite.   This was our first experience here and we left happier than when we arrived. My girlfriend and I will surely make this a regular spot from now on."}
{"text":"Really a cool little hipster Burger and salad joint.   Definitely worth trying.   Unusual dishes well prepared.   Not easy to get to but worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this for the first time last week and absolutely loved it!   The 2 people working there when we stopped by, Tyler and Nicole, were so helpful while we figured out what we wanted to try first and very friendly! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always a great place when I'm not sure exactly what i want to eat; but, want the lighter side.  If I'm feeling calorie conscious or not i always find something i like. To go is better than dine in, staff is friendly but not really more than a hang out, still fun!!"}
{"text":"Do you remember Alan Jay Lerner's musical Brigadoon?  The classic tale of a Scottish village that only appears to those whose hearts are true or something like that?    SkinnyFATS is my Brigadoon of dining establishments.  You have to have a heart that's true to navigate the mysterious vortex that is Dean Martin and Sunset - but stick to it, fellow diners!  For when you arrive at SkinnyFATS you're in for some great food.    Yesterday I went and ordered The Sweet Cheese Us sammich with a side of fruit.  I wanted the truffle fries so badly, as they are Heavenly but I'm watching my figure.  The side of fruit was nice though - not just a sad cup of melon with the solitary grape that is so standard in the world of fruit sides.  This side of fruit had watermelon, honeydew, lots of grapes, pineapple and some cantaloupe.  Jackpot!  The Sweet Cheese Us was delicious.  I was trying to come up with the perfect description for it and it hit me - it's an artisan Philly cheese-steak.  Or maybe a couture cheese-steak would be more appropriate.  Pick one, it doesn't matter because it's delicious.  The shaved NY Strip used is tender and tasty, the caramelized onions a perfect, and the portabello mushrooms are a nice touch.    The prices seem a little steep - but the portions are HUGE.  Here's a tip - go with a friend and split a sandwich.  I was alone yesterday and barely put a dent in my meal.  Another nice little tip to save dollars - don't order a beverage because they provide complimentary cucumber lemon water that is so cold and refreshing.  I had already ordered a soda and regretted that as soon as I took a swig of their special water.    Anyway, good luck finding it - the location is tricky.  But if you follow your heart (and your GPS is calibrated) you're in for a great meal!"}
{"text":"So you go in thinking sit down and order breakfast only here you order and then sit down. The menu is full of healthy breakfast options and slightly different spin on what you might expect. Pretty decent and worth the stop."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Ordering was easy, service was quick, and the staff is amazing! The location is awkward but close to my work so I won't complain. I ordered the \"meltdown\", the meat was cooked as requested but the flavor just wasn't there. The sandwich was bland and tasted like meat with some onion. If I were to go back it would be for the amazing customer service and the iced tea!  Customer Service = 5 Cleanliness = 5 Quality = 0"}
{"text":"Fuego and on point every time. Menu always has something for anyone. Fuego fuego fuego"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's located in an office park off the strip with healthy and yummy breakfast options. You order from the counter then you're given a number and find a table. Small place but it turns over pretty quickly. Shout out to Katie our cashier and server with the sunniest smile and happiest attitude! Employee of the year."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp, srirachi, and the ahi tacos. All of them were wonderfully tasty. We also ordered the buffalo cauliflower app called caulifire but I was expecting something else. I felt like there should've been an exterior crunch to them, like if they were coated with breadcrumbs and broiled for a very mild charred flavor. It tasted like boiled cauliflower brushed with watered down buffalo sauce. I also ordered a juice with carrot apple and ginger, they were out of smoothies at the time. The juice was delicious, but it did bum me out that it was pre made, so I could not modify the juices in anyway. Not sure how long they keep the juices for.   They definitely have their strengths; the tacos are definitely their saving grace, because otherwise this place would be pretty average."}
{"text":"Total crap. How bad can u make a salad and soup. This is the worst food that I have ever eaten. This is not healthy at all. It's worst then eating at Mc Donald's. Go someplace else trust me."}
{"text":"Based on reviews, we stopped here on our way to the airport.  Wow, it was packed but it seem to turnover fairly quickly.  Waited in line for about 15 minutes and was able to snag a seat as a table cleared.  I got the Ahi Sriracha taco and turnip taco.  If I based the food review just on the turnip taco it would be three stars.  The Ahi Sriracha taco is where it's at!  Portion sizes were good for us as we overate in Las Vegas.  Would have to order more food if I came in here starving but overall a great experience.  Maybe order from the fats side?  Would be nice if they were able to expand to outside seating though!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The staff is amazing friendly and always up beat. Been in many times and will continue to go back"}
{"text":"It wasn't disgusting but it wasn't great. I could overlook the weird location if the food and service was good. The guy at the register took about 8 minutes to take our order of three things. Then when the food came it was wrong. Then it tasted like it came from a fast food joint.  Also 3 different groups sent back food in the half hour we were there."}
{"text":"Always a great place whether it's breakfast or after the gym, one side of the menu is healthier (skinny) and the other side not so much (fats). The restaurant is really cute and really urban. I love the Greek pizza with gluten free crust and their smoothies are awesome! Their hangover remedy is really good even if you don't have one it's full of vitamins and vegetables. The staff can be either really nice or not so nice it's really hit or miss but overall pretty good."}
{"text":"This place was great. Awesome food. Great staff. Spend the money for an Uber or taxi to get off the strip and get a great meal."}
{"text":"I don't even know why I bother with this place. It's always a complete cluster no matter what time of day you come. I even ordered online but still ended up standing in line and waiting at least 20 minutes after the time I was told my food would be done. And the worst part is that while you're waiting for your food there is no place to stand so you're just awkwardly standing there trying not to be in people's way. It's a bummer too because it's really close to my office but if it's at least a half hour deal every single time I come here then it is not worth it. Get it together people! The food is NOT that good to wait this long and go through all of this hassle."}
{"text":"Fish tacos or wrap is best I have had since mexico !   This place is always hoppin and the staff is on it! Try anything here it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I've been to another location I want to say. This one however is amazing. The girl behind the counter was so helpful. I was there on 8/14 around 7:30. She never said her name I wish she did. She was a vegetarian like me so pointed out a lot of great items on the menu. I took her suggestion to get the black bean burger with truffle fries. They even had vegan parmesan cheese. KEY TO MY HEART.  I had the buffalo cauliflower too. I love when people make that because it tastes just like wings, just no meat :)  I did however get this organic apple \"cider\" thing. Idk if it was old or flat, but it tasted flat with no carbonation. I spent $12 on it :( it was more than my whole meal lol. Sucks when that was the worst part of the meal. I didn't tell them I didn't like it because they were so sweet so I ate the $12.  at the end they walked around handing out samples of peanut butter cookies! Nom nom."}
{"text":"Skinny fats concept is hilarious yet awesome. On one side of the menu it has all clean health aware items. On the other side of the menu they provide an array of \"fatty\" choices. Both sides are delicious! I'd also recommend getting a handmade juice!"}
{"text":"I love their food especially the chicks on Broadway and the slow boat to China and there's another variation with fried shrimp but they recently stopped allowing soup to be a side. I was just disappointed because it made a great side with different sandwiches that I got and they have other sides that cost the same.  I go to this place all the time Solid 4 star food and the service is great but they gotta get that soup back on the sides!"}
{"text":"I have been to Skinny Fats 4 times in two weeks...Love this place!  The staff is very friendly, the food is off the charts and the vibe is just what we need in Las Vegas!!  I have ordered off of both menus and everything has been delicious.  I highly recommend the \"Slow boat to China\"!  This place is great!!"}
{"text":"I've come here twice and on the car ride over there yesterday, my friend said \"I think I've come here once, but I don't remember.\" Which summed up my sentiments exactly. I don't remember eating anything amazing and the previous experience was a blur.   The restaurant seems too small for comfort. Definitely not enough seating for 6PM on a Friday. We were lucky enough to get a table because our other friends were holding one while they waited for us to arrive. The girl at the counter was nice, and the food came out pretty quickly. They have sodas from an indie company that's not Pepsi or Coca-Cola which is awesome. That's the only good thing I have to say.   The truffle fries didn't taste anything like truffle and my friends were wondering where it was on the fries. My chicken sandwich looked like a portobello mushroom and quickly became the joke of the group since my friends thought there was no way a chicken sandwich could be that dark. It was practically burnt to a crisp. Either that or they don't change their frying oil with enough frequency which is gross too. The sandwich tasted really bland and dry. Hardly any aioli and it wasn't until I was more than halfway finished that the slaw/aioli started to show.   My friends weren't crazy about their food either, so I'm pretty sure none of us will return. If you're looking for food to hit before the airport, you should go to El Fresco's just on the other side on Paradise for what Vegas voted as the \"Best shrimp tacos\""}
{"text":"Ordered a hamburger and some buffalo chicken tenders. Delicious! This place is amazing"}
{"text":"Stopped by SkinnyFATS on our way out of town from EDC. It was great. The food was good and the service was fast. The only thing was the resturant was very small. Lots of people were picking up for take out because there was no avaliable table. For a popular place there should have been more space."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the Ahi Taco San with habanero sauce. Staff is always pleasant and attentive. This place is definitely a hotspot with locals and should be checked out by everyone. Just delightful."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about the food here.  Use the App to order your food before you arrive and do not expect at seat at peak lunch or dinner time.  Try the Shroomin in Philly with shrimp and sweet potato fries.  Only request is please expand and put one in the northwest side of town."}
{"text":"Being forced to be in Vegas for 6 days and I ate here three times.  SO worth the drive away from the Strip (although not even really that far).  I ate something different every time, and every thing was awesome.  Loved that they have a distinct menu choice between \"Happy\" options and \"Healthy\" options (which were all still leaving me very very happy in flavor, and minus the guilt afterwards).  Perfect for taking people with different diet choices and restrictions, including Gluten Free!"}
{"text":"Always good at skinny fats! Healthy or happy! I order the warm springs location as they have the full juice and shake bar."}
{"text":"First thought when I got my food was.. this is it? But after I tasted the food it's great and it should probably be the portions we should be eating opposed to the feeds 3 dishes everywhere else. Their cluck-moo was amazing!"}
{"text":"Off the strip, but tons of parking if you have a car. This place was recommended by several friends who had been to Vegas as tourists. My companion and I dabbled with both the \"happy\" and the \"healthy\" side of the menu...  She had the tuna sandwich and a taco. I had a taco and an app for my meal (the siracha shrimp) and we were satisfied. We wanted to try the Hot Mess so we ordered that for fun, but didn't need it. It was our least favorite item, though the fried dough it comes with is soft and flaky. We're originally from NY and both a bit snobby about \"Buffalo chicken\" flavor anything, to be honest.  FYI the siracha shrimp is a bit spicy, if you're sensitive to that kind of heat. I thought it was perfect, though!  The cookies are fab. Definitely get the salted caramel one!"}
{"text":"I should've came back to edit my review a long time ago but I was informed by another yelper that I kinda hadn't. So, the first time I went to enjoy some skinnyfats I wasn't all that impressed. From the cashier to the uncleanliness and food which lacked seasoning/quality. I had the cherry popper, eh..the pictures seem to be more mouth watering. Anyway, the second time around I went for breakfast and ordered something simple. Eggs, potatoes, sausage,has browns and my husband ordered the slither burrito. My advice if you come here and are looking for a burst of flavor,choose something that looks complicated! The smoothies were great. Cashier still didn't seem very inviting but she was respectful and so was staff. It was a bit more clean then the first time we came in. Would I recommend to anyone, no. Would I recommend to another friend or local,yes."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, usually getting the chicken parm sandwich with truffle fries which is always really good, but today I came in for breakfast and ordered the cinnutella breakfast with a side of bacon and wow. This is definitely the best thing I've had here, if not one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. It was crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. The chili Nutella sauce wasn't spicy or overly chocolaty, and it was balanced nicely with the berries (strawberries, raspberries and blackberries). You would think this breakfast would be overly sweet with the cinnamon sugar outside and the Nutella chili sauce but it wasn't at all, and perfect with the bacon. The bacon was nice and thick cut and cooked to perfection. Their coffee is also really tasty and affordable at $2. I plan on coming here more often for breakfast since I live five minutes away!"}
{"text":"Great food and variety. Service was great! Had a classic burger, great portion and sweet potato fries were great also. Great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Love that this place opened up on our side of town. I had the \"Just Blaze\" special menu item. Only complaint is that my poached eggs were over done and had more of the consistency of boiled eggs... I'm overlooking that because the dish itself was really tasty. Service was fast and every one was very friendly, especially the guy at the front who took our order! This will definitely be one of our regular breakfast/lunch spots."}
{"text":"I came here during lunch time so it was little bit busy. I ordered the Mean Bean burger with Truffled fries and cucumber with hummus. The burger was cold, the cucumber with hummus was decent. If I could, I would get the pitas with hummus instead. Their fries were really with their special pineapple ketchup. Overall the experience was decent, this is place a good place for quick bites."}
{"text":"Very cute place, lots of art and color on the walls which was nice and modern. The staff is very friendly, helped us right when we walked in. The menu is a lot so it took awhile to decide, a secret menu is there and also online which was pretty neat.   The foood was good, not to die for but good enough to make me come back. Thought it was small but actually just one thing can satisfy and make you full. Price isnt bad id say it was worth."}
{"text":"#Merica  It didn't look like there was a restaurant hidden in this corporate park, but BOOM. I like the concept behind this place.   They have ketchup with jalapeño on the tables. Tread carefully!"}
{"text":"Ok so I thought maybe this was a marketing ploy after driving out to an industrial area for lunch but it was really good.  Love the healthy options and non healthy items split on the menu.  The cluck moo was good and healthy and had lots of flavor.  Husband ordered the non healthy side with chicken and waffles and the waffles were thick and fluffy and the chicken strips good and crunchy.  We ordered sweet potato fries and they were the bomb It was a $15 cab ride from our hotel though. Wish they were closer because the food was worth it and not too expensive."}
{"text":"I am particularly a fan of Skinnyfats. Not only is it cool, their food as well as their staff are amazing people! What reason is there not to go?  I have come here on numerous occasions and I have had things such as their Smoke in a Bowl, to their Cherry Popper. Everything had been delicious since day one, and all at a fair price. The best part of this place is that they have a healthy side as well as a happy side. Both sides taste delicious, but the healthy side of course is just a bit healthier. If you haven't spoiled yourself yet, I suggest you do so, and bring a friend!"}
{"text":"I was searching on Yelp for a healthy place nearby to eat, one in accordance with my diet. I stumbled upon this place, and after looking through the photos and menu, decided to make a quick stop. Upon arrival, I was delighted by the concept--cool and quirky...aaand the ultimate hipster attraction. It's set up for guests to order at the front (at the time, the line looked long, but it was deceiving and rolled by quickly). I sat and waited a good 10 minutes for my food with my yummy Summer Quencher juice (points). As for my food...I ordered the Smoke in a Bowl from the \"healthy side\". I could tell it wasn't exactly healthy; it felt heavy and greasy compared to all the very clean food I ate this week. It wasn't the prettiest site either, but everybody else's food looked decent, and they raved about their dishes upon first bite (TBLT and ahi tacos)."}
{"text":"Review update:  Recently moved to the area, I've been coming to the original location and the Warm Springs location since they opened. The Warm Springs location just needs to work on the little details.  Visit once to twice weekly, and two weeks in a row, my medium burger was cooked well.  Even asked for a knife to show the staff just at the burger came off the line.  The food and beverage is phenominal, a consistently overcooked burger won't keep me from returning, but again, it's just the little details that could be improved to make it 5 stars.     Recently they've been shouting Hello and greeting guests entering the door.  I find this to be annoying, just like Jamba Juice staff shouting across the store to greet.  Refinement.  SkinnyFats is a unique brand that should not be giving into that.   It takes away from the brand."}
{"text":"Great place!  I've been here 10+ times.  You can choose between healthy or happy/tasty.  I mostly choose happy with the cheese steak, burger or chicken sandwich. I like the juice too.  The restaurants are small (W.S. and D.M. locations) but worth the trip!  I hope they add one in Henderson closer to where I live so I can go more often."}
{"text":"The ambience is nice and friendly. I ordered the Chicken&Waffle plate and it wasn't cooked properly so I asked to replace it with the #Merica and the kind server, Rica, was kind enough to do so. The Merica was a much better choice. Thank you for making my experience a nice one!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always solid. As per usual Chix on Broadway was amazing. Alex was super helpful. Best lunch spot in town"}
{"text":"We finally got around to trying SkinnyFATS tonight. I was a big fan, but my husband is a little more picky and wasn't quite as pleased as I was. He didn't like the cucumber water, and I agree that the flavor was a little strong. I had the Naked Chix and my husband had I believe the Wake N Bacon (breakfast sandwich). I thought my meal was awesome; my husband's only gripe about the sandwich was that it had onions and the avocados were sliding off. He said the breakfast potatoes didn't have much flavor. The girl who served us (didn't catch her name, unfortunately) was super kind and explained the whole menu and concept of the restaurant to us. I definitely plan to go back and try some of the \"happy\" menu items as well as some of their juices and cookies. We only got checked on once during our meal, but because the drinks are self service and you pay when you order, that's to be expected.  I would recommend checking out the menu before you go to get an idea of what you want; I felt like I was rushing my husband because another couple had come in behind us and I didn't want a line to build up. I thought the atmosphere and decor were super cute. I get sick of all the chain restaurants here in Vegas, so SkinnyFATS is definitely a welcome addition to our 'hood. I'm just sorry I waited so long to give them a try!"}
{"text":"They have an amazing stuff. Made sure we were all happy and the variety of food is awesome! Let got back from a hike at Red Rock and I don't feel bad about the food I ate. Don't forget a smoothie because no one makes it like skinny fats!!!!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place on the way home after a week long trip in Vegas. By far one of the best fast casual eateries I've ever been to. The reviews speak for themselves but the experience cannot be described into words only your tastebuds can understand."}
{"text":"All I can say for this place is the best food I have ever had in a while if I could I would give it 100 stars that's how good it was. The cucumber smoothie and the cucumber boat with avocado and fried shrimp was beyond words can describe I can't wait till next weekend I already made it part of my routine every other weekend I will definitely be stuffing my face at this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at skinny fats and boy was I maze it two different menus of skinny and fat is just genius for a second I thought it was a little offensive but then honestly either go in there with the stomach of being healthy or the stomach of wanting to gorge and no matter what skinny fats will have it for you absolutely love this place coming back with a few friends when you're feeling hungry come to skinny fats"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I'm on the hype train, but SkinnyFATS was very good. The menu had a lot more options than initially expected and ranged from healthy to greasy. Prices were very much on the high side but the quality is right on line. Portion sizes are a little small for the prices as well which hurts my review of the restaurant.   I had the bbq chicken bowl with brown rice and pineapple. It was a delicious dish and pretty filling considering it was pretty low calorically.   I might come back because it is becoming a Vegas staple with the health phase zooming into sight in the area. And it's close to my work which is a plus. The lines are a little longer than most lunch places but that should be accepted in the area with only so many local options to choose from."}
{"text":"I love this place because they have options for if you're feeling healthy or like a fatty that day. The vibe is very much like a hipster hangout and the outside is so nice with their little stringed lights.  I've liked almost everything I have eaten there, some additional garnishes I do find unnecessary but others I've gone with love it. My favorite would probably be their buff chix with sweet potato fries  They do carry their own brand of drinks so it's not Coke or Pepsi products, oh so hip...You would probably spend there what you would spend at a chili's."}
{"text":"Big fan of there tacos and the weekend bennys are perfections on plates. Only reason it gets 4 stars is They dont have many seats and togo ordersjust don't cut it"}
{"text":"Skinny Fats is my new favorite restaurant ever.  With such a great concept having 2 sides to the menu (Healthy vs. Happy), you cannot go wrong and there is a dish for just about everyone!  Everything I've had so far at skinny fats is delicious.  I get overwhelmed each time that I'm at skinny fats because I can never make a decision! everything on the menu looks so tempting!  Their \"Slow boat to china\" and their \"Ahi Srirachi\" has a similar taste, both AMAZING! I love their \"Stuffed Right\" pepper as well as their waffle dishes. I did order their Benny Special this past weekend and it was to die for! They always have specials that are not broadcasted on their menu, but rather on their social media pages.  You would have to follow them in order to see what the special of the day is!  Also, their pressed juice? So fresh and so yummy!  I love the decor in skinny fats also.  Very laid back and modern. Staff is always so friendly and quick to attend to your needs regaurdless of how busy that are (and they are always busy).   I highly recommend skinny fats!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy!  I love the soup! The sodas are good too!  I can't wait to try more of the menu! Staff is nice and informative and the place is clean!"}
{"text":"I am SO happy SkinnyFATS is just down the street from where I live. This place has such a fantastic menu & ever a \"secret menu\" so once I saw that I immediately had to go check it out. We got the chicken parm with a side salad from the secret menu and boy oh boy did it blow me away!! We also got the Philly with sweet potato fry's & the cucumber boat with shrimp. Yummmyyyyy!!"}
{"text":"This place is for sure a go to when I want something quick and delicious that's not \"fast food\"  The juices are all fresh and VERY affordable. They have a secret menu that is amazing & a must try!!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say but I think this place is overrated. It's not great - it's not bad. Service is ok - just like the food. They are extremely busy and I've heard lots of compliments about their food."}
{"text":"Awesome service, and delicious food. *If you request the gluten-free menu, be sure to double check the ingredients with the staff- some of the sauces (the teriyaki,  specifically) was not gf. Beware!"}
{"text":"Started off with really friendly service. I had the \"skinny\" pancakes with banana agave. Delicious and extremely filling, and without the guilt, of course!  My friend had the Chicks on Broadway.  He gave the meal a 3. But, there are tons of options, so everyone will find something they love. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered Happy Chicks with a coffee. It was all delicious! Enough food that I could've shared had my friend been with me and not at a conference that morning!"}
{"text":"Fun food, upbeat atmosphere, close to home. We have eaten breakfast and lunch here and recommend both."}
{"text":"This is a refreshing take on both a healthy diet and those not ready to take that jump.  This eatery is modern, inviting, service to be desired and best of all, food you will love.   I enjoyed the first visit a meltdown that left me so pleased I returned the following day for lunch to grab another. Both times were accompanied by truffle fries and a dab of jalapeño ketchup. The third trip to date, within the same week was for a Sweet Cheese Us with sweet potato fries. It was an excellent choice.  Make sure you try this new hot spot soon!"}
{"text":"I need to go here again but the Chicken Parm was huge and the chicken tasted very fresh! Not to mention you can eat healthy or happy and they use good ingredients either way."}
{"text":"Best damn fast-ish food in town. Took me forever to try it because I thought the portions looked small. Don't be fooled kids. There's FOOD here. Great vegan option - black bean burger, which makes me happy... And hello! Jalapeño catchup on the table. WHAAAAAT."}
{"text":"Awesome menu, awesome staff, awesome experience. Every. Single. Time. We return here again and again and have yet to be disappointed! We are greeted with a smile EVERY time we come in and some staff is beginning to recognize us and say Welcome Back! There's two sides to the menu: Healthy and Happy. I Mostly eat from Healthy but have been devilishly delighted when ordering from the Happy.  Bottom line: a great menu with an incredible staff never EVER disappoints."}
{"text":"It's pretty overpriced and full of itself for a place with mediocre food, but if you have friends on a diet and those who like to indulge, it's a great place to find both types of food."}
{"text":"Lots of employees and not many customers on the afternoon when I went. Waited a pretty long time for our to go order and had to go back because only 2 of the 3 items were in the bag! Not sure there is much focus on getting the job done right. Hopefully it will improve."}
{"text":"Leaving Vegas this morning and planned on going to Cracker Barrell on the way back home. They had an hour and a half wait.  No thanks.   I jumped on my trusty Yelp app and found this wonderful place. I have a little trepidation about writing a review because I am not sure I want to share.   Pulling up outside, you might not realize it is there. Don't fret, there is magic behind that door. First time here so we weren't sure of the exact procedures. The staff was so friendly and helpful. It seemed like they were truly invested and loved working there. It felt like home.   The inside is pretty small, bit we found 2 seats at the side counter. I went and ordered and my wife saved the seats.  once you order up front, they will bring your food out.   I ordered the smotherlode. On the outside you could say it is a breakfast burrito.  once you get into it, you will see it is much more.  filet meat cooked perfect and soft.  Sausage with just the right flavor. potatoes and grilled veggies.  it was awesome.    My wife got the chickawaffaloplis. A perfectly cooked waffle with a smotherlode of chicken fingers on top. There was so much chicken. the crust on the chicken had a sweet tinge to it. she killed it.  Maybe next time I will try something from the skinny side of the menu.   I just want to mention again, the staff was awesome."}
{"text":"Went to see what the hype was about even after a friend sad she had an awful experience with the food and the service. Well went once and upon ordering a lot of the equipment was broken or down, so we left.. Wanted to give it a fair chance. Returned a few weeks later. Ordered the fries with the steak and pico and salad. The salad was good but nothing special. The fries didn't live up to the hype and didn't look as good via Instagram. Pretty bland- The tables were dirty and customers were cleaning them themselves to sit. There was one guy seeming to be running around doing everything himself, the girl upfront although nice to us seemed to have attitude with everyone and seemed annoyed. Wasn't an awful exp. but they seemed a little unorganized. Might try again if in neighborhood but won't go out of my way"}
{"text":"Incredible food. Must stop casual breakfast worth the drive or u we ride from the casinos."}
{"text":"Ordered the vegan curry bowl, it was delicious. Also, had the tomato soup, it was ok. Taste like tomato paste. Clean place, nicely decorated."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a restaurant and spent a longer than normal amount of time browsing the menu trying to figure out what to order because everything on it sounds good? If no, then that can absolutely happen here at SkinnyFATS. The split menu idea of a healthy and happy side is clever and makes for an exciting place and you cannot dislike a place that serves breakfast all day.   The staff greeted me immediately as I entered and even gave suggestions on what they liked from the menu while I was in line in decisive mode. The inside was kept clean and tidy. Huge seating area and even a bar-like area with multiple televisions.  It was my first visit and won't be my last."}
{"text":"Good food, I was a little overwhelmed by the menu but the girls were great guidance. We are not spicy-food junkies so it was also hard for us to find something ... So we went for the Cherry Popper  burger with fries. Was GOOD! We also had coffee and was sooo good! We are coming back next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very impressive! I came here with my wife looking for a good place to eat that had a good vegetarian option. I've been hearing a lot off positive things from my customers where I worked so I recommended it to my wife this late afternoon. The atmosphere alone put us in a good mood. They were nice and busy, the wait wasn't long, the decor was superb and the service was very good. We will definitely be back. Kudos to the Founder of skinnyfats for creating such a great spot!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really liked the original location. We are loving their new one. The food is just as good and the atmosphere is amazing. We've had Jessica as our sever/cashier about four times and she's always happy, patient and accommodating. The outdoor dining experience was probably my favorite part of their beautiful new location. Now that it's across the street from my workplace I'll be able to enjoy this wonderful establishment more often. The New hours really work for me too. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Don't come Durring lunch it is too packed.. However food is good and definatley a cool place to check out."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem!!! The place is small(they are expanding) but the food is outstanding!! We had the wake n bacon delish !! The pepper jack cheese was on point and went well with the avocado.   We followed it up with the Cinnutella, cinnamon sugar French toast with spiced Nutella orange agave and berries. It was quite frankly the best French toast I have ever had hands down!!   My wife loved the Charlie Brown shake. We will come back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, good vibe, great service! Definitely will be back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times since they opened and each time I hope it gets better. It doesn't. First of all, you have to wait in a super long line which they purposely make you wait in because they don't want too many food orders to go into the kitchen at once. However standing there, especially with kids, is not the way they should do business. Their salads are way too expensive for the portion that you get. I had the chicken and waffles today. The waffle was tough and my chicken was soggy. The atmosphere is great and the people are really nice, but the food is very hit or miss. The one positive thing is the cookies are amazing! Even though I got my cookies to go and when I got home they gave me the WRONG cookies. Nevertheless, they were still very good. Hopefully, since this place is still new, they get their act together and fine-tune the establishment and kitchen. I've been to the other two locations and never had a problem with the food."}
{"text":"Our friends who live here wanted to take us somewhere local with good food. Well I am not complaining! My boyfriend and I shared the steaknation sandwich. Shaved New York strip, arugula, tomato, red onion and horseradish on a wheat bun. We each added a side salad the sandwich in the salad was plenty filling for both of us. I was on my best behavior so I did not lean over and taste everybody's dish but I wanted to it all look good. They have the cutest salt and pepper shakers! I may have to find out if they sell them, just found out they do. Guess I'm buying one. I will be back every time I come to Las Vegas. Looking at their menu they have things like turnip taco !naked chicken. Zucc it,This consists of zucchini noodles egg plant squash peppers mushrooms cherry tomatoes and some kind of sauce. Lots of healthy foods I could go on and on but just come try this next time you're in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I love SKINNYFATS. You just need to time your visit carefully as both the Durango and Dean Martín locations have limited seating. Friendly service and delicious food for any meal of the day. My kids absolutely love the Mickey Mouse pancakes and I love the \"Smoke in a Bowl\""}
{"text":"Best restaurant in vegas bar none. The burger is the effing crap lol. Add bacon and avo. Omg. To die for. I ate two. In one sitting. Like i finished one and got up and ordered another. That doesn't happen often. It will probably happen again though."}
{"text":"Healthylicious!!   Went there for dinner yesterday and really enjoyed it! The atmosphere was good, personnel was friendly and helpful, and food was tasty!!! I got the healthy greek chicken flatbread, and even though it wasnt very filling, it was delicious! My friend got the cucumber boat and she really liked it too!!"}
{"text":"I finally made it over to SkinnyFats after hearing and reading so much about it. It was great!  Many friends told me it's very small and to try to go later in the day, as to avoid the lunch time rush.   I met 4 other people at noon on a Monday. It seemed pretty full at the time, but we had no issues waiting in line to order. Wait time for food to be served seemed just about right, and everyone in my party received their food roughly about the same time.   I had the healthy breakfast option. Bonjour Brûlée: two pieces of French toast, two turkey sausage patties, berries, and agave. Although I was extremely jealous of everyone else's burgers, I was thoroughly happy with my meal choice.   By the time my group was done, the restaurant was packed with a line almost to the door.   It seems like people think it's in an odd location, but I feel like it adds to its charm. Location also doesn't seem to be a problem for them, considering it was so busy!"}
{"text":"Whenever I want to eat something healthy this place always come to mind, but I end up ordering from the happy side. I love Skinnyfats because they have tasty dishes for all my cravings and their fresh squeezed juice are also good. My favorite part of this place is how they divide their menu into two sides, happy and healthy. Happy is for those who aren't watching their calorie intake and healthy is exactly what it sounds like. Whenever I go I always get the liquid defense because it's very refreshing, and no matter what I have to get a side of their truffle fries. If you haven't tried this place then you're missing out. So I highly recommend stopping by and trying something new each time."}
{"text":"This is such an amazing place to eat at. It reminds me of Fat Sals that's in LA but a Vegas version. I came here for EDC weekend and I absolutely do not regret coming here. It's a little pricey but so worth it!! I highly regret visitors to stop by.  Also, they have a healthy side too, so if you are trying to watch what you eat, no problem they have a healthy menue too.  Will definitely stop by again next time I'm in town.  :)"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. Everything on the menu is amazing. It's all organic. Great people, great atmosphere.  I go here all the time. I love the burgers. Everything is so healthy, and delicious. Even the soda tastes better here. Lol. It's so close to 5 stars, but a three star price.  Always good food, always a good time!"}
{"text":"I gotta say..this place is pretty cool. It's a small deli...not a restaurant! So all you haters that want to call this place overrated be gone.  I'm giving it a five star based on uniqueness and customer service. Food and price were 4.5 stars.  We walked in and a sweet teenage girl greeted us and was soooo excited it was our first time and to tell us all about how to order. Then she hands us grown ups and kids menus and then tells us about the special screen menu that was scrolling all these delish photos of their specials. I thought I knew what I wanted going in...had to rethink by having a seat.  Decided, went to counter to order and got a number - this place is deli style? COOL! We were pressed for time so it was nice to cut the wait time out.  I'm looking around at their décor... Little hipster meets American picker. Place is smaller than I imagined... But cute indeed.  Food was quick to arrive and staff kept up with chipper attitude and making sure we had everything we needed. Honestly never seen so many polite teenagers before. Kudos to manager!  As for the meal: pretty awesome, perfect portions (not too big) and great flavor. We ordered all from healthy side except pancake and cookie (guilty exceptions).  I think everything we had was in the \"wow\" category and I kept thinking... \"How is this good for me?\" Pics speak for themselves.  Note: I left feeling satisfied... Not 'sweatpants when I get home' full.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu.  Food was delicious from both sides of the menu.  The egg wrap was the best we've ever had.  Service was pleasant but hectic and our drink came after we were already done with our meal.  No apology, which from a service perspective is the easiest thing you can do!  I get that you are embarrassed, just say you goofed and take it off the check or offer something extra."}
{"text":"Food here is yummy. I love my naked chic (recommend get it). Mango and chicken and the souce make it taste so so good. Chicken in chicken and waffle are crunchy. Waffle are fresh-cook. Nothing could complain about the food. Service is chill. The place is kinda packed. You may sit on high table if no more normal table is available. Decoration is cool. The sign on the street make this restaurant is so easy to find. Price is not cheap but not expensive too."}
{"text":"This delectable little eatery is somewhat of a hidden gem, camouflaged within the concrete blocks of an industrial part of town, but positive word of mouth has this place packed at peak lunch hours. Eat there and it's obvious why. The menu is unique and creative, offering both healthy and decadent dishes. A huge highlight is the ahi tacos which they prepare healthy or \"happy\". Although they are both delicious, the healthy version ( a soft taco with seared ahi along with a kim chee-ish slaw) is my favorite. A great contrast of textures with pleasantly surprising bold flavors.  A very refreshing snack, one of the best fish tacos in town if you ask me. They also have a great variety of juices, shakes and floats. The pretty girl working told me to create my own shake (Nutella, peanut butter and chocolate) which tasted so good I had to let her have her way with me."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Always appreciate the local restaurants striving to make themselves stand out from the rest."}
{"text":"Driving through Vegas and was told I had to try the place. It didn't disappoint. We shared sweet potato pancakes (sweet brown), the burrito (smotherload), and the garlic Parmesan fries. Delicious. All of them! Wanna try the crispy chicken stuff next time! And the ahi cucumber appetizer!!! Yum! Thanks for offering healthy stuff, although my dark side will take over almost every time (with the help of my significant other). Not lots of space, but esthetically pleasing."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite, and it has both healthy and non-healthy options as well.  Great smoothies also!"}
{"text":"Great, small, out of the way spot.  Very cool vibe, decor & pleasant staff.  Food was very good.  Looking forward to returning and trying different menu items - for both healthy and \"cheat\" days."}
{"text":"I loved it... Staff was friendly and up beat, the decor was young hip and trendy, the food was huge portions.. You can split one item between two ppl.. And the food was delish.. No complaints what so ever"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the Liquid Defense. I mean seriously it is so good! The service has always been pretty good every time I've come in. Once the girl literally went through several items on the menu with me because I didn't feel well and nothing sounded good.  I've only tried a few things, but the portions seem to be pretty hearty.  I really liked the Greek pizza (it was filled with toppings) and the BBQ chicken pizza.    I'll update as I try more items.  This place is always packed when I come in, mostly because they don't have a lot of room.  I am prone to getting my stuff to go. Plan to wait a bit if you come at peak eating times."}
{"text":"I'm basically a regular here, me and my wife love this place!  Our only issue is when we order take out our food for some reason just doesn't taste as good as if had  ordered dine in   Just something to note but overall when we dine in. They have sports on and a positive atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was looking for an inexpensive place for brunch off the strip and found this on Yelp!  I only wish this place had outdoor seating or a little bigger! The staff is so friendly. Place is clean and small and great decor.   Food is amazing! They have both a healthy menu and an indulgent menu. I opted for the indulgent menu and got their chicken and waffles! With a coffee on the side which they forgot about and also the flavored creamer they forgot to bring me. But it's okay cuz I dont mand drinking my coffee black. The place was so busy that I really didnt mind.  The chicken and waffles was delicious and was the size of the plate! The chicken could have used a little more seasoning but it was so tender and juicy still. The waffle was just the right amount of crispiness and so delicious. They dusted it with some powdered sugar and the syrup just pulled everything together so delicious.  I wish I could go back and try everything on the menu, it all looked so good.  The next time I visit Las Vegas I will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My friends and I go here quite often. Recently I came in after a hike up Mary Jane falls and devoured the skinny breakfast. It did not disappoint and it restored the protein I need from the climb. I also love the Thai Cobb salad and cucumber boat. Great customer service."}
{"text":"I'm going to rate 4 for overall experience. The 3 is based on my last experience. I been to skinny fats a couple of times and I usually love what I order so I decided to try something new. This time I got the wake n bacon. I thought everything was just awful. The bacon and potatoes tasted like it was cooked in a pan with burnt oil. Just not a good taste. I don't particularly care for this location, service is nice but the other location food just tastes better."}
{"text":"This place is tiny like maybe enough room for 30 people?  We chose the place based on yelp reviews since we are on vacation & didn't want buffet food.  Warning don't go off the yelp pictures...some of the items are not available like the red velvet waffles.  You walk in & place your order at the counter.  Sit wherever you like or I should say where available.  We actually had to wait for a table to get up to have a seat.  I say down for maybe 2 minutes & a lady asked if I could move to a smaller table so her party of 8 could sit.  I agreed but I must say I was a bit annoyed.  I had already waited just to have a seat in the first place.  On top of that, we finished our entire meal before the so called party of 8 even ordered food (never saw 8 people arrive) - rude.     As for the food.  I like the option of healthy or happy...can't healthy be happy?  I got the protein waffles with berries from the healthy side.  It was good.  The juices sounded good too but they cost almost as much as a meal so I passed.  I would probably come back but order to go."}
{"text":"This restaurant offers both healthy and happy menus to accommodate different preferences. Although the healthy side had plenty of delicious options, my group and I ended up ordering from the \"happy\" menu. I ordered the cow bowl and it was delicious! I wish they put more steak in but I will just order extra meat next time. It was so good, my husband was surprised that I ate it all. This location is a bit harder to get to but the service is great and the food is excellent so no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Love love love the portobello hamburger on the healthy side of the menu.  The sweet potato fries are also very good.  Each Time I go to SkinnyFATS I want to try something else but keep ordering the portobello hamburger because it's so good"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple time and the food just falls short.  Spent 25 bucks for two people and I'm leaving kinda hungry.  Cold soup overcooked chicken burnt fries.  I so wanna love this place.  Service is actually great too."}
{"text":"Very hard to get a meal you wont like here. Extremely flavorful, lots of options and everything was executed perfectly. I'm on the east coast, but reminding myself to stop in again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The zucchini spaghetti is amazing. And the food is so filling. I love it. The fact that it's healthy and very tasty. Clean and th staff are great.  10/10"}
{"text":"Love this place! They have a great variety and no matter if you get something off the Heath or happy side it is sure to be delicious. There is something for everyone here plus the staff is always super helpful, happy and great."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it's small.. so when it gets packed, it's kind of a nightmare. The food and atmosphere is great though. I love this place, just be advised you probably want to get your order to go until they expand or start delivering to your area."}
{"text":"We LOVE SkinnyFats! My teenage son loves their Meltdown burger (way too much for me!) truffle fries are delicious! I haven't had anything on the menu I didn't like yet. Even the shakes are amazing! Kinda pricey, but different and delicious!"}
{"text":"Ordered through Postmates so may have had an effect on the food quality. Had the Turkey burger with sweet potato fries. Turkey burger was too salty, bun was great, produce fresh. Sweet potato fries were cold and hard. Had to heat everything up to make it edible. Suggest they find alternate containers for delivery as the thin cardboard box did little to maintain the food. Will try again to see if it was the food or Postmates"}
{"text":"I have to say that I was a little unsure at first.  I went there with a buddy who lives locally.  He raved about the place.  It was really good, menu was separated by color, one skinny one fat. They had a unique selection of beers.  I chose fat- popper burger with egg was really great.  Frickles are fried pickles.  Fries are shoestring with a truffle oil, really good.  Ahi poke sandwich was really good.  Sweet potato fries were great.  I really like the jalapeño ketchup.  A few ketchup choices available.  The beer was great.  Nice patio.  I highly recommend especially if you are trying to keep it light and skinny in Vegas.  Just heads up-no alcohol at the one by strip on Dean Martin."}
{"text":"Like Marie T., I kinda feel like a jerk giving this place three starts, because in truth, it seems like they really are trying. From the funky decor to the wholesome ingredients, SkinnyFats looks as if they are attempting to make a positive impact on the Las Vegas dining scene.  That being said............. The food was not what I had expected.   I really do like the healthy/indulgent theme and the service is really good, it's just....Ahhh.....I don't know...... As you can see, I am struggling a little bit with this one.   I had the Phatty Philly with the truffle fries, a soy milk blueberry shake (kids menu) and half of Vannesa N.'s sugar cookie.  Let me start out by asking, what is the big deal with truffle fries? I mean, they are good and all I guess. I just think they taste like normal french fries do. Maybe it's just me. So yeah, they were decent. The Philly looked amazing on the plate, but once I dug into it, I noticed there were like, four or five pieces of meat, and the rest were mushrooms. I like mushrooms, but when it comes to a Philly, you want MEAT, and the mushrooms are almost like a garnish. This was like a 50/50 ratio of meat and mushroom. The city of Philadelphia would be pissed if they knew! Plus, it was very oily.  The shake I ordered was off the kids menu, because honestly, the shakes on that menu looked tastier than their grown-up counterparts. I ordered the blueberry one, and they gave me the option of having it made with 2% milk or soy, as well as having ice cream or frozen yogurt. I thought that was awesome. I like having choices, so this was a plus for SkinnyFats in my eyes.  After our meal, Vanessa, Marie and I just sat and chatted. While doing this, Vanessa decided on a sugar cookie (she was sitting like, two feet away from the glass case they are held in, so I'm not surprised). The cookie came out room temperature first, and it was not so impressive. Marie T.'s friend that works there noticed that Vanessa was not thrilled with the cookie, and brought out another one, this time warm. It was better. MUCH better. Still not thebomb.com, though.  I will admit, this was only my first trip. And I didn't really order what my gut had told me, which was the french toast. I think I will try the breakfast next time, then update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough happy words to describe Skinnyfats in Las Vegas. It's a restaurant with character and interestingly delicious food. Fantastically amazing- Fantasticazing! My visiting brother-in-law experienced an awesome Vegas restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Love the drinks-especially the soft drinks with cane sugar. Love the vibe-super cool people working there. Love the deco. Just don't love that everything I have ordered is spicy. I love the quality of the food-just not the spice. Due to all the reasons of love, we will continue to go there however everything that I order will not include any sauce. For instance what I thought would be a lovely Chinese chicken salad cut in to a cucumber, had pieces of jalapeño which made it uncomfortably spicy; disappointing. One other caveat was the fruit salad that I ordered-the bowl was half full. Suggestion: fill the bowl up or use a smaller one."}
{"text":"YOU HAVE TO VISIT THIS PLACE!!! It was so good a friend and I split our meals so we could try various foods at one end and I can't wait to go back to try something else."}
{"text":"We've wanted to come here for a while.    It didn't disappoint.  Got buffalo chicken and fries.  Yummy!!!' Pretty spicy though. Now we have to go back for he healthy side."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing.  I'll never get tired of this place.  Every time I come here I always have to try something different off their menu.  My goal is to try everything on their menu.  My last visit I tried their Happymess - Truffle fries topped with shaved NY Strip, pico and bleu cheese.  Bleu Cheese is really not my cup of tea and it still isn't, but this dish was still good and would be even awesome if you like bleu cheese."}
{"text":"Hip place with a great menu of Healthy and Happy (mom healthy foods). The staff was extremely friendly and helpful when ordering.  Had some good food. Everything looks delicious and can't wait to come again. It will be 5/5 when the new location in north part of the valley opens."}
{"text":"They best food absolutely!  Such a fun and unique way to bring good food to life.   You literally get to choose from the freshest food available!  Get there early as they often fill up before you know it.   Breakfast, snack, lunch and smoothies.   Who could literally ask for more?"}
{"text":"Came for the calorie saving extravaganza, but left wanting \"flavor\". I ordered a curry bowl. It came with gummy rice noodles with curry garbanzo bean sauce. I needed more sauce and a definite sprinkling of some fresh herbs (menu said I got basil, but I couldn't find it) and some veggies. The flavor was good, but just chintzy. I saw people's towering loaded salads coming out. The people beside us had chicken & waffles with fries. Plates were overflowing. My other half had the tacos that touted 220 calories. We weren't sure if that was for the plate of two or each. She swore they were tasty. Finally, we had the cauliflower bites. They were \"OK\" just too raw and sour. I'll come back mind you, but for sure I'll have the towering salad or waffles if my diet worked. OR---- Maybe I'll just have a broccoli side with extra fresh basil and try my curry plate again!"}
{"text":"2nd time is a charm!!! Not only did I get great customer service with this crew. But my order was amazing. I had he big parm and my lady had the chic on Broadway. Chicken was on point!!! And the truffle fries were great. Plus we got a garden treat shake which was awesome as well. Good eats!!!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review due to the superior customer service I received once I told the server how unhappy I was with the chicken and waffles.  He immediately took care of my check by refunding the entire bill.  He then recommended other items on the menu and asked that I come back and try something else.  Due to his willingness to help and very friendly personality I will be coming back in the near future!"}
{"text":"I like to eat healthy so I was excited when they opened . It's my second time here . I'm alittle disappointed with both of the meals I had ."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!! This is the real deal absolute what you would call good eats....they are super duper friendly... the cashier was phenomenal....great customer service. ..very happy energy and that menu...omgoodness....I can't wait to go back...everything is fresh and properly/beautifully placed on the plates. The price is right for good food will keep me coming....great concept and just remember, I'm your #1 fan...."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was absolutely delicious. I've been wanting to try this place for some time and just never had the chance. I had the TeriyAHI and the flavors were so amazing and the bread I feel like really made the sandwich especially with the sesame seeds. Kids got a burger the only thing that bummed me on that was that I was told they are small so I got two instead of one like I normally do. I have twins and they always share and even then they don't ever finish. I guess lesson learned on that. Husband got the meltdown and he said the spicy aioli was really good. Also had the truffle fries and again really good. If I had one negative it would be that there aren't any drink options for kids. All they have is soda and my kids don't drink that. They had a fruit smoothie which my daughter loved but my son not so much. The decorations are really cool with all the wood on the walls and art. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to this location about 2 weeks ago, and it was BUSY. The line to order food was out the door.   I ordered the One-Eyed Monster, Two-Nuts, and Truffle Parmesan Fries. The cashier was really friendly and patient, and engaged in some light conversation while my credit card was processing.   The wait for the food was average, didn't take too long. Taste was good, overall. My FAVORITE thing from my order was the One-Eyed Monster. For $4.95 it's a good size (well, snack size, for me) and a quick breakfast bite. Presentation was cute too. The Two-Nuts was OKAAAY. Presentation was nice, but eating it was hard. The cucumber boat it came in was pretty hard to cut through, and made all the contents spill out, so I ended up just cutting it all up and mixing it together like poké. I love fries, so that's pretty standard, but my fries were not hot when I got them. A little disappointed, but I ate them anyway.   The other reason I am giving them only 3 stars right now is because they don't accept phone orders at this location. I'm not sure if it's because it's new, or whatever, but REALLY? Why no phone orders? I may have to edit this if they change their mind. I know I'll be back to this location because it's closer than any of the others, but only due to the lack of dining options in the area."}
{"text":"I stopped by SkinnyFATS with a friend today on the way out of town and have to say it was a damn good decision. We both actually got the Wake N' Bacon sandwich with sweet potato fries, and both tasted unique and incredible as compared with the same options at other restaurants. The Hawaiian sweet role that the sandwich was on was absolutely killer. Only downside was that the line was particularly long, and it took about 20 minutes for a carry out order."}
{"text":"Better than I hoped.   I was psyched to hear SF was coming to the hood.  I'm a weekly regular at other locations closer to the office.  This one is bigger and better.  This place keeps getting better!"}
{"text":"This establishment is conveniently located in my neighborhood. Like a few others, a good breakfast of eggs and rice and whatever protein is important to me. It truly fuels me up for the day.   I normally order the wrap superstar. My favorite even if there is no rice with it. It it is on the healthy side of the breakfast board.   It's been a few months since I've been to skinny fats so when I walked in this morning, the menu board was different so it took me a little while to find the usual. However, I thought I'd be a little different and get something with fried rice. So I opted for the Mor Cow Bowl. Not my favorite at all. Let's just say that rice should be left to be made by asians. The rice was. Or cooked well that it was crunchy. I hate crunch rice. And I'm. It much if a beef water so the filet mignon was a little too much for me.   With the negative experience of the beef teriyaki bowl, customer service is always good, atmosphere is nice and clean and the outdoor patio is welcoming but it gets a little too much sun in the morning. And of course, the number of yelp events they have participated in leaves me appreciative. The food really is good here."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS gave off a trendy vibe, and gave me a  West coast hipster feel. They split their menu into two categories: healthy and happy options. The healthy side has the calorie count on the menu but the happy side doesn't.  I got the mean bean burger which is a vegetarian burger, which is surprising because I usually don't go vegetarian for my burgers. I also got their frickles (friend pickles).  The burger was okay as far as vegetarian burgers go. I can't really judge the quality since I dont really eat vegetarian burgers, but I enjoyed it. Frickles were really good - recommend! And fries were good too.  Portion-wise the burger was bigggg, fries were a plenty, and there were a good number of frickles. Ended up boxing up ~1/2 the burger and some fries/frickles.   The place is really cramped inside, especially when it gets busy (like during lunch when my coworker and I were there). There were people standing around waiting for others to finish and leave.  It might just be because I got the Mean Bean burger, but I was not very impressed with what skinnyFATS offered."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband today. I got the Chix On Broadway. It was amazing. The crispiest chicken I've ever had.  My husband got the special (not on the menu) Filet of Fire. Also, outstanding.  Good service. Military discount. Hooah!"}
{"text":"It's a place with full of surprises with their menu. Little salty but generous portion of food. I keep going back to this place try all of their menus."}
{"text":"Off the hook when it comes to creative eats! One of my favorite lunch joints that never disappoints. The uniqueness of their menu never leaves your taste buds bored! Healthy and happy just the way I like it"}
{"text":"Let's place was awesome. My kid enjoyed his pancake. I got egg burger that was good too. Wife got tacos that she said she loved. She said she should have gotten more. I will return soon."}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Workers were very helpful and friendly. Totally recommend, just try to find a seat during lunch tho"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this location yet. The service was great and the Slow Boat to China was delicious as always!! I love them is here and the Green juice was perfect!   My biggest issue is the restaurant seems crowded and there's not enough seating for the amount of customers here.  I highly recommend eating here!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and was intrigued by the name. In each section of the menu, there is a column for \"healthy side\" and another for \"happy side,\" which was unique. Basically, happy = richer/less healthy. The interior has a lot of wood and has a cool vibe. Service is friendly as well. However, this restaurant is fairly small, so there aren't too many seats for dining in. The restaurant is located in a corporate warehouse-like area, which was unexpected.  I opted for the chicken quinoa soup as well as the fries topped with meat and cheese. I can't remember the exact names, since they were off the rotating specials (i.e. not printed) menu. Many of the dishes have clever-sounding names.   Overall, the food was tasty and portions were decent for the price. I recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice environment. It's a more chill like Starbucks environment, but more up beat. Friendly service that can't be beat. Good portion size, for the price it is good since it's more filling. Plan on takeout being an option as they are a very busy establishment."}
{"text":"This place is amazing everything on their menu is awesome does it matter what you get everything taste so good and they have natural cane sugar soda as well as beers good place to go on a date"}
{"text":"Location, location, location!  I really dug the whole idea and presence of this contemporary farm-inspired cafe, but I feel like its location does not serve it to its full potential as say maybe, downtown. This place is reminiscent of its up-and-coming counterparts located there, with its refreshing spin on food and novelty of a specific themed decor, but it felt like it was lost in a sea of industrial suite buildings by the freeway in the middle of nowhere.   The employees were definitely friendly though, and provided us the low-down upon hearing that this was our first visit. We came at a slower time, so we didn't experience the line madness that I've read about. I chose an item from the \"healthy side\" - the Greek gluten-free pizza aptly christened \"Nice to Greek You,\" while my boyfriend ordered from the \"happy side\" - a BLT-esque sandwich entitled \"Bomb Diggity\" with a side of their truffle fries, which were sooo good. My pizza definitely tasted \"healthy,\" but because of its generous heaping of toppings, I was full after only half. I wasn't a big fan of the gluten-free bread, I guess, but that's a preferential thing.   In addition, I liked how their cups are reusable. Take those babies home and wash 'em! All about being green. And if you're just going to have water, that's all right too, because they offer some lovely, fruit-infused water available at your dispense.  Overall: casual, modern atmosphere with friendly service and your choice to go \"healthy\" or \"happy (fatty).\" It's worth checking out! I'll be back for sure to check out their breakfast foods off the \"happy\" side."}
{"text":"Was expecting much better after hearing good reviews from some local friends. Made the mistake of showing up right at lunch time and the place was PACKED. Had I not promised my child french fries, I would have walked out. We managed to snag the last table, but had to wait over 30 minutes for my one burger and two sides.  I got the Mean Bean burger, which is a vegan patty, but no one mentioned that the fries come covered in parmesan cheese! Also, I would not be surprised if the bun has egg in/on it. My side of fries was cold when it came out, as was my burger. The \"Yummus\" side was weird tasting, but edible.  There were multiple other tables that the manager was called to in the short time that we were there. All having issues with their food being served cold or an incorrect order.  Overall, not impressed at all. We won't be returning. I was super bummed with the lack of vegan friendly options, and the lack of knowledge from the staff. Especially because they somewhat recently redid the menu to include more veg friendly things."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I love the concept; pretty much they have a healthy and fattening version of the dish you want, and both are really delicious! Yummy smoothies too :)"}
{"text":"Praise the food gods for this restaurant. It's about time this side of town gets a solid place to grab some good grub. This is *the* spot to go if you're craving something either healthy or fatty to eat that's not a fast food joint or Chili's. The menu is similar to the SkinnyFATS locations across town, but I prefer this one over the others. Food here is consistent, and the service is fantastic.   The Teriyahi sandwich s a must. It's hard to believe it's on the \"healthy\" side of the menu at just a little over 400 calories (if you're counting). The sandwich is hearty and flavorful and bomb over all. Seared ahi tuna slices with citrus slaw, spinach, and tomatoes sandwiched together, what's not to love about that?  The Vegwich sandwich is also a perfect pick for a meal, and you won't miss the meat. A Portobello cap, avocado, horseradish, and pepper marmalade comprise this sandwich. This is full of flavor and the peppers add some serious heat.   Sometimes, pasta can just suck it (sorry, pasta, I still love you). For a lighter fare, the Zucc.It bowl is the perfect mix of all things good for you. Zucchini noodles, eggplant, squash, peppers, and mushrooms...yum! There's also an option to add a protein of your choice. Shrimp is a good option, IMO.   Juices and chocolate chip cookies are awesome. Give those a try, too.   There's hardly ever a short line here, which is why I take my orders to go. Ordering online through their website or their app is the way to do it.   Overall: The best spot in the area to grab a bite to eat. There's something for everyone on the menu."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats satisfied both my \"skinny\" and \"fatty\" sides.  FOOD Whether you order from the \"skinny\" half of the menu or the \"happy\" half, the food is delicious and wholesome.   Cranburkey: The name alone still gives me a chuckle when I think of it, but it's also one of the first items that caught my attention. Without reading the description, the title alone made me think this burger bares some similarities to a Bobby sandwich. Not the case. Sandwiched in between a 9 grain bun is a specially seasoned turkey patty, cranberry spread, arugula, and onion and tomato slices. First bite, the turkey patty's flavor reminded me of a breakfast sausage patty. Combine that with the cranberry spread, it's a perfect match. In addition, I really dug the presentation of my Cranburkey. I could get used to having my burgers presented to me with a knife jammed right in the middle, but I doubt burger joints would honor my request if I made it.   My entree also came with the option of sides: truffle fries, sweet potato fries, and a house salad. I skipped the fries this time and went with the house salad. The salad is simply chopped romaine lettuce with dices of cucumber and tomato, and it comes with ranch dressing on the side. The salad was just, well, a basic salad, but it obviously didn't come out of a bag and \"ready to eat,\" and that makes a difference in the dining experience.  RESTAURANT Tiny. This spot seems to receive plenty of traffic even after the traditional noontime lunch hour, so seating is limited. However, you can place an order online and have your meal delivered to you. Going back to the seating aspect, if you sit at the high tables by the windows, there are electrical and USB outlets for your gadgets. Another plus side is that you get to watch the planes take off from the airport.   SERVICE Top-notch. Friendly and helpful, especially to first-timers.   OVERALL Both food and service were great, and I'd definitely return to try more of their menu items, especially their breakfast offerings."}
{"text":"I LOVE Skinnyfats. The food is amazing and the service top notch. It was my first time in and Courtney was super helpful and friendly. I may have overindugled in the delicious cookies, but it was so worth it. What's not to love??? Great people, great food, and great vibes. Can't wait to go back for more deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"Portions are ridiculous and delicious! My kids are everything on their plate... Bacon is to die for. Atmosphere is super chill and stylish! Love their condiment choices to go with the already amazing food. Will come again when we are back in town."}
{"text":"I love how I had a healthy choice and a comfort choice lol I loved their menu!! I was shocked to try their tortilla soup because I am Hispanic and I am very picky but let me tell you it's amazing! I would go just for the soup and tacos! They definitely are a new restaurant to pick from and with all the locations available it makes it even easier to find them.  The decor of each location is sooo cute you do not want to leave. I am going back to try their cold express menus as well."}
{"text":"Get the chicken and waffles is so delicious. A must try!   The restaurant is very small. Seating can be an issue but well worth the hassle."}
{"text":"My husband has been here before and LOVED it- he couldn't wait to bring me here. Our truffle fries came out first and were warm and so delicious. Then our Greek flatbread and \"spudghetti\" came out and were slightly cooler than Luke-warm.  I couldn't tell if the flatbread was supposed to be served cold or hot? My husband said his spudghetti\" was definitely supposed to be served hot and it was COLD. We could tell our food had been sitting out for a solid 20 minutes before it was served. My flatbread also was missing the olives and so sweet it was nearly inedible. Overall very disappointing experience! 2 stars only because the fries were good."}
{"text":"Healthy food on the left side of the menu, happy food on the right. Avocado toast was very good. Prices are reasonable, and there is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing options for all types of eaters. Staff always shows hospitality and food is delicious. Constructive criticism; food needs to go out immediately! Fries and other fried food is only amazing when super fresh and hot and cannot sit in the window for more than 45 seconds."}
{"text":"It's really packed in there with little seating. But it was totally worth the effort. The Ahi fish tacos were amazing!!!!! The staff are super friendly and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"$7 for a glass of OJ? What a waste. We stopped here because it's Yelp listing said it had a pokestop nearby, which it doesn't. The food was ok but it was really annoying that they wouldn't give me a glass of water but I could help myself to the cucumber water. I'm sure a lot of people like it but to me that's just gross. I actually pulled my water bottle out of my car to drink there."}
{"text":"This place was so freaking awesome! Service was stellar - the food was DELICIOUS and it had a quirky theme that made it one of the most memorable dining spots of the Vegas trip I recently took with my girls.  You can either choose the \"happy\" side or the \"healthy\" side to order from and yes it is exactly what it sounds like. A cool thing they do is that they list calorie info for the healthy side but not for the happy side! I'm all for the indulgence.  I got an item off their special iPad menu - the eggs Benedict with a thanksgiving twist. It was a delightful concoction consisting of stuffing waffles, candied cranberries, gravy, turkey and poached eggs.   My GOD it was heaven. I appreciated the perfect portioning. I was able to get my fix but also finish the whole thing.  The dessert was the best part! My friends and I got two cookies to share - the chocolate chunk and the lemon blueberry. HOT DAMN! They warmed the cookies up and it was like bliss in your mouth.  One star off only for the lack of table space - we had to wait for a bit until a party left before we could get seated.   Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We are out of town guests and found this restaurant on yelp. Excellent place to eat. Friendly customer service and excellent food. Five of us ate different items and we all loved them. They were excellent. Enjoyed eating off the strip. Plan to return  next time we visit."}
{"text":"I had the ahi tuna sandwich which was perfect served on healthy toasted bread with tomato. My side was a salad also good. The other three members of my party weren't so happy with their turkey burgers. They won't go back but I would."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and tried a wide variety of items. So far everything is good. My favorite is the chicken & waffles. One complaint though- real maple syrup would make this dish perfect. I almost ran over to Home Goods for a bottle of it. They have a friendly, helpful staff also. Great cup of Joe with free refills."}
{"text":"We love Skinny Fats! The food is always amazing. I love they had a secret vegetarian menu and am even more excited it's becoming part of the main menu. Be prepared to wait a few min to order if you go during normal lunch rush hour but they have an app if you are grabbing to go. No matter how long you wait, the food is worth it every time!"}
{"text":"This is honestly my favorite place to eat, no matter what kind of food I'm interested in eating. The staff here is incredible, always attentive and never shys away from having a conversation. The food is second to none (especially the teriahi sandwich)! The manager, I think her name is Laura, is super helpful if anything isn't quite right. Bonus points for their soda machine, which is very unique. Bonus bonus points for the fact that they serve alcohol now because that's just neat! Thanks SkinnyFats!"}
{"text":"I ordered via postmates which took a little while, but that's not skinnyfats' fault and I am up on Commerce & Charleston. Those truffle fries are pretty bomb but they could use more seasoning (I'm just a seasoning whore). Probably were better hot, again not their fault- my delivery took an hour or so. The Chicken sandwhich was pretty good as well. I'll probably add more toppings next time."}
{"text":"I've heard very polarizing opinions about SkinnyFATS; some people love it, others despise it. After visiting a few times, I've finally formed my own opinion.   Just as polarizing as their publicity, SkinnyFATS' menu has an interesting dichotomy; one half depicts health-conscious, fit-inspired meals, while the other half is diabetes incarnate. It's really odd to see 400 calorie vegan burgers alongside burgers that require needing triple bypass surgery upon completion.   It's hard to define what's good and what's bad, because SkinnyFATS is such a hodgepodge compared to what you'd normally expect at a restaurant. What I will say is that anything you like, you will love. Recently I had the Naked Chix, which is Mango Basil Chicken with Jasmine Rice and Cilantro Mayo, and it was exceptional. SkinnyFATS also has everything dish labeled very well, whether you're a vegetarian, vegan, or eat gluten free like me!   You may have to explore the menu a bit to find something you like, but SkinnyFATS does a lot of things right. This location specifically can get packed during peak hours, especially since it's right across the street from a gym, but it has something for everyone, regardless of diet, which definitely makes it a good option when you're out in a group."}
{"text":"My lady and I loved it so much, we came back for breakfast 2 days in a row! My favorites were the fresh morning sandwich and the very berry strong waffle. I also liked the skinny bowl and juan healthy wrap. What I really loved was the garden treat shake. I made it a little healthier by getting it with frozen yogurt and soy. It's a great hangover cure! Can't wait to go back. Stay thirsty and hungry my friends!"}
{"text":"I love skinnyFATS! They have so many different options of food and beer. This location is so nice and the staff is very friendly! Definitely the spot to go to while you're at the mall!"}
{"text":"We tried to eat here last month, but the line was out the door (no thanks). The second time wasn't so bad, but there was still no room to sit, so we ordered to go. My BF ordered scrambled egg whites, bacon and toast. I ordered the gluten free Nice to Greek You. My BF refused to eat his food after a few bites, no flavor, to bland pieces of bread with no butter, the egg whites were runny. My \"pizza\" tasted like a GF pizza crust like you get at the store, ranch dressing, Greek condiments, and sliced precooked chicken you get in a bag. The ranch was way too overwhelming and rich. Since we were eating this in our car, we ended up having to stop somewhere else not too long after. Skinny Fats could get some lessons from Palm Greens in Palm Springs, CA. I think that was what they were aiming for, but missed the mark."}
{"text":"Love skinny fats! They have options for everyone whether u want to keep it healthy or have something a bit heavier. They are always busy so be prepared to wait. The inside decor is very rustic/artsy it definitely had a cool vibe. The employees are nice and the food is good. Only complaint is there is never enough seats:"}
{"text":"Came in and the ambiance is the most hipster place I've ever been to.   I ordered on the Happy side getting The Meltdown with a side of sweet potato fries and an order of Frickles (Fried Pickles) with a drink. The drink came in a plastic cup that you can wash & re-use? Not sure about bringing it back to the store and re-using though.   Overall price was $20 something dollars... pretty expensive in my opinion for a patty melt, sweet potato fries, drink, and fried pickles.   Flavors were great though with the sweet potato fries being the best I've had yet. Beating out The Habit and some other places that serve sweet potato fries as well. They had nice dipping sauces at the table for you to use like Chipotle Ketchup.  Frickles were nicely fried and seasoned with cajun. Tasted great with the aioli they served with it.  I'd come back if I ever craved for something like this, but for the price value nah."}
{"text":"Ordered the Ahi Srirachi tacos.... they drowned in the tacos with teriyaki sauce! Taco we're sitting in a puddle of sauce! The tacos were soggy... as soon as they came out I took one bite and was disgusted got my money back! Not crispy at all! My daughter ordered the chic salad... chicken was DRY! Too expensive for the low Quality of food or maybe it's just the chef sucks at this location???? Not coming back"}
{"text":"If you want Skinny, this is your place.  If you want Fats, this is your place.  If you are dating someone who is the complete opposite of you, this is probably your place too.  Everything on the menu looks absolutely delicious and I am deeply regretful that I've only been here once so far.  My only suggestion:  ACAI BOWL for breakfast please."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!! I love eating healthy and my husband loves his burgers! We ordered The Meltdown and the Naked Chix. The food was amazing, chicken was nice and juicy and the sauce they had was superb. My husband was done with half his meal by the time I went to the car to get my jacket, so it's safe to say he enjoyed it very much.  The outdoor seating area is great, I love that you kind feel like your in your own home.  I go there when I want a smoothie also. I have tried the Cucumber Delight and The sweet something (I forget the name sorry!) But both are delicious, the cucumber is great with frozen yogurt and soy milk.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place many times and decided to give it a try. I chose the Whole Wheat French Toast with Apples and sugar free syrup (on the healthy side) and the orange smoothie on the \"happy\" side. Both were delicious. the only downfall was its a very small space and when I came it was PACKED. It was a beautiful day so I would have sat outside but there was only one table out there and it was already taken."}
{"text":"Centrally located with a menu that totally rocks!! Skinny Fats has a simple yet hip atmosphere. The very tasty \"Meltdown Burger\" with sourdough bread is one of my favorite creations. A fantastic blend of flavors. Every time I go to this place I'm completely satisfied and in a great mood!!!"}
{"text":"This hidden small treasure is worth trying more than once! The service is great and always trying to be helpful. I recommend the waffle, sriracha tacos, cucumber shake, & orange juice shake. The shakes are so refreshing & yummy! Not like a typical smoothie or shake from a Tropical Smoothie or Jamba. Next, I have to give props towards their actual dining area. It's quaint, colorful, vibing, has phone chargers, purse hangers, cute water jugs, & hip chairs. They lose a star from me for their overprices, few unappealing food items (buffalo chicken, fries) and office-like location. Despite the small location, I have hope they'll create another bigger & better location though. Other than that, this new place is above average & worth their concept."}
{"text":"The concept for this restaurant is a lot more interesting than the reality. I picked menu selections from the healthy side. What I really wanted to order were the ahi sriracha tacos. Unfortunately, they were wrapped in flour, not corn tortillas. If you ask most people watching what they eat, they'll tell you flour tortillas aren't the healthiest option. I ended up ordering the \"Slow Boat to China.\" It's chicken salad served on top of a cucumber boat. The salad was yummy, but nothing I couldn't make at home. When I go to restaurants, I typically like to eat things I can't make myself. I also had the god fries. I really don't like the name, but they were really good. It was a generous portion of sweet potato fries topped with chicken, balsamic dressing, feta and olives. I also liked that they didn't skimp on the toppings.  I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be rushing back for another visit, mainly because the blonde girl who took our order was rude and bossy."}
{"text":"This is the best thing to come to the south west part of town.   Healthy foods and beautifully decorated!  They have a great choice of natural sodas and great teas.  My family and I can come here multiple times a week and never have a bad batch of food.   Customer service is always great, and they do an amazing job keeping the place very clean.    I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone.  My favorite dishes are Berry The Steak, Meltdown, Sweet Cheese Us, Cherry Bomb, and plenty more!"}
{"text":"Super yummy!! Had the chicken and waffles; great flavor.  My husband had a sandwich and soup and loved it."}
{"text":"Went for lunch for the first time today and it was excellent!  When we walked in we were greeted by friendly staff who explained the menu to us and even told us about the secret menu as well!  Food was great, no complaints there! You will definitely see me again soon!"}
{"text":"Based on the manager response I am completely taking Skinny Fats out of my future. Wow \"wished I'd called\"? I clearly expressed confusion then dismay when I tried to place my order then I went to the same social media platforms I used to sing your praises to my friends to revise my opinion. Here's a tip don't inconvenience and blame customers when business strategy is faulty! This review is an update that should have posted at the time of the horrid response THE POLICY REMAINS so does my opinion"}
{"text":"All I have to say is... wow! My friends kept talking this place up and I decided it was time to check it out. My friend and I had just finished having a heated game of Disc Golf and we decided to make it interesting with a bet of \"lunch on the loser.\" I lost...he cheats...so, we came to SkinnyFATS.   I ended up going with a skinny steak sandwhich, the \"STEAKation,\" which is shaved NY strip with arugala, tomato, onions (I didn't get the onions), with a yougurt horseradish sauce, on a wheat hoagie roll.   The hoagie roll was ridic!! It was so fresh, I would have just been content with that. The sandwhich as a whole was good. It would have been better to have a little extra steak and yougurt horseradish sauce. I did get a side (truffle fries) with this for the $11 charge. The fries were outstanding.   I loved the drink choices, all natural soda's including burch beer, there were two different types of tea, and water with cucumber slices. I'm not a huge soda fan, but I tried the burch beer because I've liked it in the past. I opted for the fresh water.   My friend had the \"Smoke in a bowl.\" It looked appetizing, but too many onions for me.   Overall, fantastic experience. The prices were normal for a restaurant of this caliber. Like the terminator...I'll be back."}
{"text":"Devirginizing jen. Ahi taco San is yum!!! If you are looking for a healthy or not so healthy dish, come here. You will not be disappointed. Small and cozy place, price is right"}
{"text":"The food here keeps me coming back!! It's healthy option is on point!! Somewhere my \"less clean\" eating style husband and I can find something we both love!!"}
{"text":"Most times, when something is just  \"eh, I've had better\" or \"A-OK\" to me, that means I'm not coming back. It was fine, sure, no rude staff, short wait time, decent enough food, but nothing that stands out either. And this is part of my problem. Why would I go back somewhere that was eh, when I can go back to a place I really like?  I came here for lunch with Marie Catherine (ha, like that!) and Ife.  It's a funkyish kinda place. There is self seating at the window and tables to choose from. You order at the counter, and then put a # on your table. (Like Pei Wei). The food was eh. I wasnt impressed by the menu at all. Although I didn't really know what to expect on the menu, it did not impress me at all. I felt like it was thrown together somehow; sloppy."}
{"text":"This place is killer. Everything we tried (a little skinny and a little fat) is super flavorful! Give this place a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried anything from the FAT part of the menu, because the \"Skinny\" part of the window is so good! (and healthy!)  All of the food surrounding us looked unbelievable! There are lots of vegan options for my fellow vegans   I got the mushroom burger. It came with so many ingredients, it was huge! Plus a good size salad! There was enough for 2 meals.   My companions both got bowls, and they were drooling over their choices as well. I don't think you can go wrong at this place...  They have fresh cold pressed juice on sight as well. Nice outdoor seating! I love this place!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFats never disappoints! Whether I choose the happy or the healthy I am always satisfied when eating here. I love that they have one of a kind dishes and I love their cookies! Atmosphere is always great along with the customer service. One thing I dislike is how small both locations are and the parking, very minor and nothing that will keep me from not eating at SkinnyFats."}
{"text":"The best vegetarian burger I've ever ate! Super cute place i love it, the food was prepared very fast was extremely delicious, the girls was so kind and that water with cucumbers and lemon one of my favorite.."}
{"text":"OMG this was such a cute little place! The food was soooooo freaken delicious! I kind of wished I lived in Vegas just to be able to eat here all the time! If ever in the area of Las Vegas you must try this place out. You'll be welcome by a colorful wall and servers who are enthusiastic about there food as they should be. It was my first time and they were all very helpful. Guilt free doesn't just mean salad and water it means SKINNY FATS!"}
{"text":"I ordered Sunny Side eggs, they came out over easy - My wife ordered their version of a BLT that was supposed to have Pepper Jack cheese and it came with Cheddar- Orders got confused but the small vibe and food taste were top notch -"}
{"text":"This place may not be flawless -- it could be bigger and not all the food is perfect -- but there are plenty of amazing things that make this my favorite lunch spot. You can't go wrong with either the ahi taco-san ($3.75) or ahi srirachi taco ($3.50), both which were overflowing with ingredients. Portion sizes are generous all around. The Off the Stick ($12) gluten-free pizza was large enough to share. It's not your typical pizza crust (thin and cracker-like), but everything topping it was so amazing that the crust was secondary. The Happymess ($9) with truffle fries and sliced filet is another hit.  Their menu is divided into healthy and not-so-healthy offerings. Although, some might argue that the agave nectar used in many of the healthy dishes isn't healthy at all. Personally, I'm not a fitness freak and I'm not strict about what I eat. I'll pretty much eat anything. And, so far I've had plenty of dishes here from both sides of the menu and have loved just about everything.  4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"With two locations and more on the way, SkinnyFats has the formula to expand to even  greater heights -- healthy and not-so-healthy versions of classics plus some creative dishes thrown into the mix in a fast-casual, affordable, hip setting.   The larger interior is a welcomed change from their first location and I'm a big fan of their outdoor patio when the weather is nice. After many visits to both locations, the food may not seem as innovative as it once was, but it's still some of the best I can find for a fast meal.  The sweet cheese us ($12) is always overflowing with shaved NY strip, peppers, onions and mushrooms. It's one of my favorite steak and cheese sandwiches when I need a quick fix. For something healthier, the skinny Q flatbread ($7) was decent with it's crispy crust and moderate amount of grilled chicken, cheddar and red onions covered with an agave BBQ sauce.  They've got a kid's menu too, but my son prefers a side of grilled chicken ($4) over their chicken tenders. Their chocolate chip cookies are pretty good. Served warm, the edges were slightly crispy, with a chewy and moist interior.  This location always seems to be busy during peak hours so it's best to hit it up at other times. Still, for a quick meal there are few places that are better."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong with this place. I'm here on a Saturday afternoon... The best time to come when it's not busy. The staff here is always nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  When I first walked in, the place smelled amazing, and I already liked it.   I took a look at the menu, and was overwhelmed in a good way. There were so many great options. Plus a \"healthy\" and a \"happy\" side.  How cute!  After staring at the menu for a while, I decided on a protein style TeriAHI with sweet potato fries. The woman who took my order was also very nice (I don't remember her name, but she's legit!)   My food came in a timely manner, and the waitress even dropped off some Sriracha aioli for me and my friend to try. A new favorite!  So good!  Good service, good FRESH food, and great atmosphere.   Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes after all of the reviews and anecdotes from friends. Once I got in there the seating was lacking. We started at the window bar but was quickly turned off by the uncomfortable seats. A man left and we sniped a table, which was much nicer. It was quite loud in there but not too bad. I ordered a Nashville spicy chicken sandwich. $11 for a sandwich on a plate. The sandwich was very greasy and oily m, which ended up sighing the bread and upsetting my stomach. My friend ordered the Buff Chix bowl. Came with a few chicken strips and fries for $9. That looked much more satisfying. Lastly, we both ordered a side salad. It was very dry and bland, which was too bad. I don't know if I'll try it again, but the first impression wasn't everything I had hoped for. I will say the employees were very friendly, though. Great service."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever eaten here is brilliant.  My favs are the \"more cow bowl\" \"caulifire\" and the \"salted caramel cookie\""}
{"text":"I have been here so many times and it's always delicious. I love everything on the healthy side is so delicious and doesn't feel like you are eating healthy."}
{"text":"Good food,  I thought I was gonna get a small portion. But portion is more than enough. Good flavor!"}
{"text":"Had really good service from the crew and loved the food! Everyone seemed to be happy and smiling."}
{"text":"Before SkinnyFats Greens and Proteins was my go to place but not anymore. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! Food is so great, always something new and delicious to try! I would recommend trying any of their specials which you can find on their Facebook or Instagram @eatskinnyfats  all employees were so friendly and very helpful with any questions I ever have!   Being a juice lover, they have many fresh cold pressed juices, recommended combinations & custom juices. So refreshing for these hot Vegas days.   Overall this place is so great & definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I wish I were close to breakfast this delicious every day! There's a reason the line goes out the door sometimes! Their cold press juices are great blends of flavor and so are their sodas. I had the protein waffle with chicken. The orange sauce was so good with everything! I'm not always a fan of turkey bacon, but theirs was the best being a little thicker cut while still crispy. My boyfriend had the red velvet waffle. He was definitely hoping for more berries and topping, and he also mentioned that a special cream cheese syrup would have been nice. He still loved it though! We left very happy and will visit again if we're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is decent, quick service and the place is clean.  Hubby and I chose from the healthy menu side and was happy with our selections.  My whey protein waffle with the turkey parties was satisfying."}
{"text":"Excellent new location.   Much larger than the original.  Good size portion of food and everything thus far 6 visits has been flawless.  Parking is lacking.  5 star all the way around"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Extremely clean restaurant! Bathrooms are clean! Amazing food!!! Definitely a better location vs the one on Dean Martin. This location is much larger and a very relaxed environment. The turkey burger is my favorite!! Healthy alternative and the fresh fruit instead of fries makes it delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Day 1 tried the TaTS their play on a BLT. I got a soggy turkey bacon sane hitch on toast nothing special don't get it.   Also ordered the Chix on Broadway that was a great meal on a brioche bun my wife loved it.   The buffalo chicken bites are also very good.   Day 2:  Ordered breakfast:  Cluckamoo it's an egg white omelet with filet mignon in the middle. The meat was cooked well and it's a light yet filling breakfast.    The staff is friendly and willing to help. I asked to switch an order I made and apart from a couple rolling of the eyes they said no problem.   Overall great place to try cool modern twists on classic meals."}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas for a couple shows and wanted to get away from the buffets that are offered at the casinos. Came across SkinnyFats and fell in love. Super friendly staff, atmosphere was simple and clean. Good use of space for seating however due to the good food space is limited somewhat        I actually ate here on Saturday morning and went back Sunday morning on our way out of town. The food was very tasteful and well prepared. This will be on our radar next time we are in Vegas. You gota try this place. perfect little gem in the concrete jungle known as Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great concept. I made the mistake and tried to eat 'healthy'.  Next time I'll pick the fat side. It looked much better."}
{"text":"Pretty much everything I have had here is very tasty.  The employees are nice and polite.  They have healthy and normal choices.  I highly recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"From the look, this place should look bigger, but its pretty tiny. The food here is delicious. I love their concept, one side of the menu is fatty food and one side health. To me the fatty side does not feel heavy at all. Order the filet mignon stir fry very flavorful, for price not worth it cause you don't get much meat. Do try the special risotto balls very good. The tacos are very tasty too."}
{"text":"After a yelp event at UFC Blue Diamond, a few of us decided to go to SkinnyFats to replenish our energy.  When we entered the establishment, we were surprise to see how crowded it was.  It's basically a, grab a seat upon it being available.  Hesitate for a second and it will be GONE!   So for next time, we know that while someone in our group is ordering, others will grab a table.  Onto the food.  This is what Earl and I ordered:  -Hangover Remedy Juice: Good. -Beet It:  My favorite.  I really like the strong ginger taste of this.  AND, I love beets. -Slobb Cobb Salad:  Nothing special.  A typical Cobb Salad. -Apollo Fries: Very interesting, but it worked.  Sweet potato fries, chicken, arugula, balsamic glaze, craisins, and olives, all in one bowl.  Never had it like this before, but it worked!  The concept is awesome.  There is the Healthy side, and a Happy side.  If you have a mixture of healthy eaters and not as healthy eaters, this place will satisfy both.  I can eat clean here AND have my cheat day here as well.  Brilliant.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I'm EXTREMELY picky with my meat. But the chicken here is delicious thinly sliced and cooked to perfection! We were seated right away. It was full in there but of course it's so delicious even though it was full they make sure to find you a seat or make it work somehow. The waitress was very helpful and even added in an extra frie! Definitely will be coming back to this place to try new things! The avocado burger was delicious never ate anything like it!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and staff was friendly. It was our first time there and we will be returning. The staff handled a pain in the butt customer that sat near us very well."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, never been disappointed. They always have their specials on social media. I get the chix on broadway and a hangover remedy and they are always delicious. Smotherload is great too. Theu are always busy and i see why. Will definitely dine again!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. I figured I'd give it another try as my first experience was just alright. My fiancé and I had the Chix on Broadway, Chix n Waffles and Ahi Taco San. I can now say this place is great to eat at! All meals were rich in flavor to their own style. We ate every last drop. We will def be back."}
{"text":"Great food, casual and fun atmosphere. I had the country fried steak, biscuits, eggs, and gravy with orange, lime, and basil shake. My husband had the buffalo chicken and truffle fries. We liked both of them. We will be back when in Las Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Caulifire was spicy and delicious. I also had the spicy chicken Latino soup which was full of flavor. I would highly recommend checking out SkinnyFATS. Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"I love the food here, but the service is impeccable. I drive all the way from la to come here even if just a craving for the truffle fries. Today, their pos system was down and rather than turn me away, they put my meal on the house. THATS HUGE to me as someone who believes in taking care of your consumers. I'm sorry you guys had to deal with the chaos and angry customers, but the team kept calm and helped everyone.THANK YOU"}
{"text":"Very, very yummy! Sweet potato fries are excellent. The decor is very nice and beautiful. Service was great and there was a minimal wait for our food. We came in around 10 am when it wasn't super busy."}
{"text":"The place was spacious even on a busy day was able to find seating quick, we had breakfast and everyone enjoyed their meal, me very happy with our visit."}
{"text":"This popular place with the health foods crowd is in a tough place to get to, not visible from the street, very, very limited menu, and very average health food at best."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked and heard about it a long time ago. I finally got to try it today. I'm so happy I did.  My bf and I went there after hiking.  Once you walk in, you order at the front and they give you a number to set on the table, then you go find a seat. They bring the food for you.  It's unique how they have a healthy side & happy side. They give you the calories for the healthy side and I wish they would give you the calories for the happy side too.  We ordered the cheesesteak 'Sweet Cheese Us' with Truffle fries, Teriyahi sandwich, and Pimp Shrimp and Caulifire from appetizers.  The food came out pretty quickly, about 10 min or so. The cheesesteak sandwich was cheesy and had a generous amount of meat. I loved the bread and the cheese sauce they put on top.   Teriyahi Sandwich and the appetizers were delicious.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome waffles! I had the healthy and the man had the happy. Loved this place for the options for both fat and skinny. Perfect for me and my man."}
{"text":"Nice food concept. Are you feeling healthy or fatty? Good place to go if you and your date have appetites on opposite ends of the spectrum.  Be warned - this location is a little far from the strip. It's a newer location, but well worth the drive. There's plenty of seating inside with a large community table in the center. I like how their stools are 4 feet high. There's also seating outdoors. Overall ambiance: hipster.   Food (all on the happy side): 1. Chicken n Waffles Nicely fried (but not oily) pieces of chicken tenders. Served with a thick waffle and syrup on the side. This was GOOD, but not amazing. I ordered this because I was craving something along the lines of fried chicken and breakfast, but I wouldn't order this again.   2. Ahi tuna taco Not worth trying in my opinion. My expectations of ahi tuna is either RAW or seared RARE. This ahi tuna was neither. Tuna was deep fried, and the center was very dull pink. Comparable to tuna in a can? I'm leaning towards that put down.   I would return to try other items on their EXTENSIVE menu. Which reminds me:  Dear SkinnyFATS owners, please include some sort of pictures on your text-heavy menu. My eyes and alcohol infused brain do not have the attention span to read and decipher your food map.  Otherwise, rock on with Vegan Diabetes."}
{"text":"Love me some Skinny Fats! Super great, fresh, healthy food! The service is great and the outdoor patio area is a special treat....a little bird told me that soon mimosas, wine and beer will be served from the Cold-Press area next door. I'm so happy you're in my neighborhood and right next door to my Reiki Spa Las Vegas booth at Sola Salons! I'll be visiting often! xoxo"}
{"text":"Whenever I go to skinnyfats it's always super busy! I admire the staff for always keeping up with it. Today I ordered the T.A.T.S. It was subpar I don't think it was anything \"special\". I know they have other good food items that I am willing to try, but the T.A.T.S. just tasted like an avocado and turkey bacon sandwich which is exactly what it was. So it did live up to the taste. I also had a side of sweet potato fries and it was AMAZING! I like skinnyfats breakfast food more than their lunch food. I will definitely be back for breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"Very healthy, but a little understocked. I know it's difficult but try to keep all the goodies on the menu. Also the location off the 15 is very easy to get to. And gets you a little out of Vegas. Great airport stop."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I leave super happy! The combo of good for you or bad for you food is so unique and the service is always friendly! Just wish it wasn't such a haul to get there..."}
{"text":"Definitely glad I tried this!! They have a half healthy/half not so healthy menu. It's a really creative concept that caters to a lot of different food preferences. They have ALL DAY BREAKFAST, which I think is incredible. I had the Blueberry Yum Yum, which is french toast with a blueberry compote type sauce and orange agave. I was hesitant about that combination, but it was actually so good. My dad had the T.A.T.S., which is basically a healthier version of a BLT. It came with a side, so he got truffle fries. All in all YUM."}
{"text":"That is a solid menu and a great local spot..."}
{"text":"With all they hype, I thought it was going to be amazing.  It was OK.  Food was prepared decently, and looked good, it just wasn't what I expected. The staff was friendly, and for as few seats as there are, there was never a wait to be seated.  I wish it had been MORE for me."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went to this place around lunch I ordered the filet o fire, and he ordered the meltdown. All in all the food tastes great. I can definitely see myself returning here ... The only issue I had was with the strawberry lemonade, it has a aftertaste I'm guessing from them substituting  the sugar with something else but still OK."}
{"text":"Really good mix of food on the menu, and a nice selection of drinks, staff really friendly. Slaw Chee is really nice. I had the 'Sweet cheese us' a nice hoagie with a spicy kick from the peppers. Really small venue, so you are unlikely to get a seat when busy."}
{"text":"Love their food and service. It's all healthy and tasty.   The staff is very helpful and friendly.   Otherwise, what more can I add but yum!"}
{"text":"So happy to have this delicious restaurant nearby!   Its a beautiful place! The wood accents and bold lighting add to the cool artwork and giant smiley face marquee! They also have a patio that will be open in cooler months.   No call ahead ordering yet so I walked in and waited in line to get my food to go. It wasn't terribly busy so I was glad to see the lines have gone down a little since opening.   I ordered a Tu-Nuts, a nice to greek you and a side of frickles!   The tu-nuts was a large Cucumber shell topped with tons of ahi tuna, a little slaw, fresh avocado and spicy aioli! Delicious and fresh it's easily shareable but I indulged in this baby all myself.   The nice to Greek you was a crispy flatbread with feta cheese, chopped Cucumber and tomatoes, tzatziki sauce, big slices of grilled chicken and a sweet balsamic glaze!   Frickles were crispy pickle chips with a little Cajun seasoning spice and the chipotle aioli served up with them was the perfect side kick.   The cashier was helpful and efficient, the staff was friendly and my food was done quickly and correctly.   I'm looking forward to frequenting this place for my healthy and guilty pleasure eats!"}
{"text":"Yes, there is always a line, but that should be a good sign! And it went pretty quickly. We used the take out menu to scope out the options since that seemed to be the only thing available at the end of the line. Our order included the Rosemary Jane and the Skinny Q. The Rosemary Jane came with a protein waffle and grilled chicken and both items were cold. That was a little strange, but the flavors were good. The Skinny Q was a flat bread with grilled chicken, peppers and bbq. The sliced red onions all over it were over powering and really strong. I would order this dish without them next time. Overall the service was quick and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Eaten here a couple times before. Food has always been good but today the experience was horrible. My husband ordered the protein pancakes which came out immediately--even before other tables who ordered before us. Made us wonder if they had just been sitting in the kitchen. Six minutes later my breakfast wrap came out then we had to wait another four minutes for my step-son's egg whites, fruit and toast to come out. When we asked why our meal didn't all come out together we were told \"I dunno, kitchen priorities I guess.\"  You would think the kitchen's priorities would be to get all items on one ticket out at the same time.  As far as the taste, the protein pancakes were just ok; they were more sticky than I remember. My breakfast wrap was good. My step-son had to go to the counter and ask for butter because they gave him dry toast with his breakfast. What kid likes dry toast?? Then the butter they gave was rock hard and tore up his toast. Very disappointed and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Honestly, I would have taken one star off for the awkwardly shaped restaurant which can't help but be crowded and the coffee that was the most disgusting thing I've ever had, but the employees are SO nice that I just didn't care at all.  They remade my coffee from iced to hot and kept asking how it was.  The coffee was god awful, worst I've ever had in my entire life.  Like colored water, but it wasn't their fault.  I'm sure the company says exactly how much coffee to put into the machine.  I ended up just getting a water and calling it a day.  The veggie burger and sweet potato fries were very good!  The girls who work there are all very nice and bubbly.  It must be a good place to work!"}
{"text":"OMG! Best healthy food I have had in a long time! The sweet potatoes are to die for! I love the whole concept and decor! I'm in love!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I ordered sweet potato fries with the blue balsamic steak salad through Postmates. $25 total    I have eaten at skinny fats A handful of times and I've  never had a bad experience hence why ordered through Postmates. But this time was very very disappointing the sweet potatoes were Raw and cold  the salad came with stringy fat steak too much spinach and hardly any of the toppings.  I called them to issue a complaint and see if I can get reimbursed my money or maybe they can remake it. But nothing could be done because of \"Postmates \"  I was told a manager would get back in contact with me but no one has called as of yet.   Postmates won't reimburse money because of the merchant and the merchant won't  reimburse because of Postmates."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but mostly the service is incredible! The staff is so friendly every time we go here to eat. We live close by and visit often and have never been disappointed! Love the Steaknation sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Some of their items are a little hit or miss and SkinnyFATS can get pricey pretty quickly, but the quality of the food is hard to argue against. I had a waffle sandwich my last time out here, definitely a Happy side special, but it still wasn't so bad. While it was supposed to be a pumpkin chicken waffle sandwich, there wasn't much in terms of pumpkin flavor. That being said, the flavors were excellent.  My friend got the naked chix, which was pretty good with the mango sauce, but the rice is rather plain. However, we mixed in a bunch of habanero chili sauce with our order of truffle fries and the rice and everything got tastier!  I've enjoyed SkinnyFATS before, but the new location is both roomier and easier to get to for the majority of people. Their layout is fresh and modern, with a nice outdoor area really adding to the amount of people they can handle. I look forward to visiting more often now that the location is more convenient."}
{"text":"I have never been accused of being \"hip\". In fact, having used the word hip in a sentence probably indicates how far off I am. But I've been around long enough to know that our attention starved society thrives on the mindless pursuit of trendy behavior that leap-frogs from fad to fad in a desperate attempt to stay relevant in a culture where being odd is more highly valued than being - well, just about anything else.  Traditionally, this type of pursuit has never served the restaurant industry well. Most attempts to shake up the culinary comforts of the nation as a whole have failed with spectacular results. Even those few dubiously places who manage to grab the attention of the culinary media, with a spotlight on some cable food program, usually end up falling out of fashion as fast as they rose into it.   Trying to be different in the culinary scene is never as successful as trying to be better. There is a reason places like Franklin Barbecue in Austin Texas have people standing in line for hours every single day, they serve better barbeque than anyone else - in a place that saturated with barbeque. You could try and recreate barbeque in Texas - I mean, it's a stupid idea, but you could try. You might even get Guy Fieri to stop by on his road show, or have Adam Richman try to inhale 20 lbs of Macedon brisket in 15 minutes. If you do, chances are you will have massive success in your new stupid adventure (for a short time at least). But after your 15 minutes of culinary fame have ended and Guy no longer answers your phone calls, what you'll be left with is a small but dedicated troupe of regulars that can't afford to keep your stupid alternative barbeque restaurant in business.  Trendy but doomed restaurants are usually very easy to spot. Take for example this place called SkinnyFATS. See what they did there? Clever huh? They took skinny AND fat, and put them together in one place - - hash-tag: mind-blown - POW!   I wish I could explain to you how SkinnyFATS dichotomy of culinary concepts works, how the fat and the skinny are magically brought together in one revolutionary concept, but - well, I have no idea. And from the looks on the faces of everyone else standing in line, they didn't know either.  You see, SkinnyFATS fancies themselves as being on the leading edge of cool, hip, trendy (whatever you want to call it) culinary fashion. So much so, that their menu is a clusterf**k of confusion - \"I mean a literal clusterf**k of confusion.\" You see the name of the menu item, and read through the entire description under of its ingredients, and you still have no idea that they are talking about a stupid burger. I wasted an ungodly amount of time on the skinny side of the menu, and didn't figure a single thing out. In fact, the only thing I am sure SkinnyFATS has on their menu is a burger with cherry peppers, because that's what I ordered (of course, I had to confirm it was a burger first).  Now listen, the burger was really good! I mean it, I enjoyed it immensely. I will probably go back at some point, although I am not certain I will ever order anything else off the menu, just for fear of having an aneurysm trying to discover what it really is.  As for the trendiest of trendy culinary fashions on their menu, the truffle fries - well, they just plain suck. I mean it, stay away!  It's not real truffle oil, it's not made from truffles at all. It's a nasty chemical concoction that is made from petroleum and some cheap oil, and it tastes like crap. The fact that a single gram of truffle costs around $26 should alert you to how obviously fake these fries are.  The staff appear to be enjoying their time as the cool kids on the block, they have an air of superiority that is well deserved, since they are most likely the only people who know how to translate the menu. Don't get me wrong, they are the \"friendly\" cool kinds on the block - they're not likely to pull your shorts down to your ankles and laugh at you, but their collective indifference is plastered across their faces. Usually this type of unfriendly customer service is a result of being forced to labor for less than a living wage under greedy owners, but I'm only guessing - maybe young people just hate work all together.   I am not disappointed in SkinnyFATS, in fact I appreciate the fact that they have chosen a moniker that is the culinary equivalent of a book with a picture on the cover of a muscular man (with long flowing hair) holding a woman (with a 12 inch waistline) in his arms - it pretty much sums up what's inside."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really tiny so finding a seat can be an issue. You place your order at the counter upon entering, they give you a number and bring your food out to your table when ready. I have tried a few items on the menu until I had the Wake n' Bacon (bacon, egg frittata, pepper jack cheese, avocado and Siracha cream cheese on a Hawaiian sweet roll) and now I'm hooked on that. Their fresh juices are good as well."}
{"text":"We flew into Las Vegas for a girls weekend and after all the hassle of landing, retrieving bags and securing a rental car, we were HUNGRY!  But you can go to a Olive Garden or PF Changs in any town! We wanted local flavor!  Boy, did we find it!  You have to look carefully because this place isn't in a location you'd expect! But look carefully because you don't want to miss it! It's worth the extra effort!  So be prepared: it's small, but there are tables and a bar along the window for seating. You order at the counter then find a place to eat (or have one of your party claim a table early). So it's not a large, sit down and have someone take your order place!  Walking in the door, you are greeted by the friendly staff! They really know how to make you feel welcome! They're enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the menu suggesting substitutions to fit your tastes or dietary needs.  Then the food came.  Yummoh! I ordered the Vegwich and changed the dressing to the lemon basil aoli. Best sandwich I've ever had in my life! My niece got the Chix on Broadway and it was a BIG sandwich! It was also amazing! The only comment she had was that she couldn't taste the dressing -- would have asked for more! My sister got the Happymess and while it was good, it didn't blend well...more just foods that were put together in a bowl. But all those foods were good!  The fries were BEYOND divine!! Both the regular fries (which were skinny but managed to still be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside) and the sweet potato fries. Not enough words in the English language to describe how incredible they are! Best I've had!  So there were a hits and a few misses, but nothing that would ding the quality of the food, the great feel or the awesome staff!!"}
{"text":"Was amazing can't wait to visit to eat hete again! Go sunday the shrimp Benedict was so good. I also got the 2 different ahi tacos bomb as were the Sweet Potato fries"}
{"text":"Needed a new lunch spot close to work and SkinnyFats came to mind. My wife and I went on a Friday around 12:30 and the place was packed. I overlooked the menu while waiting to order and proceeded to place my order to go. I wanted to eat there but it's just too small and too many people were waiting.  -Tu Nuts , this was an awesome starter . Crisp and refreshing on HOT sping day. Spicy tuna on a siricha slaw served on a cucumber boat with teriyaki, peanuts and a spicy aioli.  -Ahi taco San, tempura Ahi with siricha slaw, mango pico with spicy aioli on a puffed shell. Very messy but definitely flavorful. The puff shell broke after the first bite and there was a lot of the components to make it messy, that's wait fingers are for, cleanup!   The other items coming out while I waited looked so good. I can't wait to come back and try some more. The staff was friendly while rushing around taking orders, serving and clearing tables."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It may even be my favorite place to eat in Vegas, and that's saying something. You have to go off-strip, but trust me- that's a good thing. We ordered the steak eyes and some truffle fries. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. It was delicious. I wasn't hungover, but at the time I did thing, \"Man, this would be great hangover food.\"  The staff might have been even better than the food. They were super nice and helpful. We all noticed it. Keep up the good work! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get brunch. They recently changed the menu though which is so disappointing and I loved the 'nice to greek you' but the breakfast sandwich with the sriracha cream cheese is also so delicious. Can't go wrong with the truffle fries! It's usually pretty busy, because it's so delicious!"}
{"text":"Chef Josh Green has given the people a very good reason to drive to this out-of-the-way location just a little past Larry Flynt's Hustler Club. Once only exclusive to his VIP clientele consisting of high profile musicians and celebrities, we can all enjoy some of his tasty creations at Skinnyfats.  There is something for everyone here, whether you're watching your weight, trying to live a healthier lifestyle, or if you just want some feel good comforting food, you can find it here. Unfortunately for those who are off on the weekends they are closed to the public and reserve the weekends for catering functions. Business hours are Monday through Friday, 8am-8pm.  I decided to pop in one day before going in to work and try the Bon Jour Brulee(Their Version of French Toast)Two pieces of multigrain bread dipped in their \"Creme Brulee\" egg batter and cooked to perfection, served with fresh berries, butter, whipped cream, and agave syrup. It also came with two pieces of applewood smoked bacon. for $6.75, this is a steal, and a very good way to start your day.  I also enjoyed my Sweet and Spicy Shake-Juiced beets, apples and ginger blended with banana and frozen yogurt-YUM! Shakes are offered in two sizes(24 and 32oz) and you have your additional choice of soy milk, 2%, frozen yogurt, or vanilla ice cream. Great first visit, and next on my hit list is either the burger or the Chicken and Waffles, their secret menu item.....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Good food, good service and a decent price. I have all three of my children  hooked as well."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Even though you expect a bunch of muscle heads to be there because it's a health conscious restaurant, it's a super hip place. Customer Service: Great staff, you can tell when someone loves what they do or are really good at paying attention to detail. I love that you place your order at the register and they bring it to your table and pick up your dish after your done. Food: I love the Sunday Sundae! I guess they change it up every week and honestly the presentation of all their dishes are awesome! Also you have a choice to go healthy or not so healthy so it's a great place to go if you have a vegetarian or vegan friend cause they have a lot of vegetarian dishes and for the most part you can modify a dish to make it vegetarian. Price: For the quality and amount of food that you receive it's inexpensive. Overall Experience: Overall awesome! Great job guys! Few places I can say this about but I could actually eat at SkinnyFATS every meal of the day every day."}
{"text":"Crazy menu, but it works.  Everyone is very friendly greeting you when you arrive and when you leave.  Food was delivered quick and best of all was the Charlie Brown Shake (Nutella and Banana).   As Arnold says, \"I'LL BE BACK!!!\""}
{"text":"Out of curiosity I tried the ZUCC IT. As the menu states the first ingredient is \"zucchini noodles.\" It had me visioning spiral cut zucchini noodles with a tasty sauce and vegetables.  Spiralizing, I've seen this trend in restaurants and food magazines.  When my dish arrived what was in front of me was not what I had imagined at all. I suppose as a culinarian, I read too deep into the description of the menu.  The zucchini noodles because they were shredded thinner than angel hair pasta, once cooked, became soggy strands in the sauce. The ratio of zucchini noodles, which is the highlight of this dish considering they named the dish ZUCC IT, was not the highlight at all. There was way too much sauce for the amount of vegetables and very little zucchini. The result of this dish was an unappealing texture of web like strands of zucchini tangled in cuts of vegetables drowning in arrabbiata sauce. Can you envision it?  Calling them \"zucchini noodles\" may make the dish sound hip and trendy. However, it only lent to the failure of this dish.  Just cut up the zucchini and leave the word noodle out.  What I ordered was a bowl of vegetables stewed in arrabbiata sauce.  That is what your menu description should have read.  I would have ordered that with no further expectations.  I have eaten at other locations and enjoyed it.  I'll still return here since its closer to me but won't be ordering ZUCC IT."}
{"text":"I ate a late dinner on Saturday night and had the most amazing experience. I felt like I was at a high end restaurant. The service was outstanding. I have been wanting to try it out for a while. I was greeted by Zia, the shift manager, when I was standing looking at the menu and felt a little lost. She came over and explained everything and was so friendly. Throughout the meal I felt like everyone that was working there was just as nice as could be. They all made sure everything was ok even as and after they were closing. I did not feel rushed. Tony, Adrianna, Brandon, Kate & of course Zia are all wonderful people. I will definitely go back again and again. The prices are very reasonable and the food is flavorful and unique. I just cannot get over how amazing the service was especially for not being a high end expensive restaurant."}
{"text":"When you walk in, you think its an Abercrombie & Fitch store. Music is so loud, you cannot have a normal conversation. Very small space, only enough seating 20-25 people max.  I give the food presentation and flavor 4 1/2 stars but the price for the portion size is like those of venues located on The Strip. Way too over-priced. $2.50 for a side salad that consists of maybe a cup of chopped lettuce, some diced onions and a thimble full of dressing. Those prices work in the Tourist Corridor but not as an Industrial Area Lunch Spot.  If the prices dont come down, once the newness wears off, revenue will drop immensely."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast worth the short ride from the strip. Great food and awesome staff. Will be back. Ate too fast sorry no photo...."}
{"text":"I posted a ton of pictures with captions on them so you all can see what the food actually looks like from the pictures they have posted.   The last time I was in Vegas I drove by here.... and kept driving. This place is in an office building complex. It doesn't look like much from outside, that's for sure. When you go inside, the place is clean and super hipster. The menu items are a good amount so you have options.  When you walk in to the cashier asks if you've been there before. If you haven't, like me, she explains how the menu works. It's pretty simple. They serve all the menu items literally from 9 AM to 9 PM.  This place is super super small so try to come during those non-rush hours. I went around 6 o'clock and there was already eight people there, and in about 10 minutes 10 to 12 people showed up... And I was feeling a little cramped. There are seats aligned along the window and lots of plug-ins for you to plug in your computer and or other fancy items... However that's the same wall that you have to walk past in order to get to the cashier, and there are four person settings directly behind where you're standing. So if you're the table directly in front of the cashier you are getting a clear butt shot of every single person ordering. Definitely not going to be my favorite spot to sit.  I finally figured out what I wanted to order. But also wanted to get the opinion of the cashier on what the most popular item was on the menu. She didn't know and rambled off one thing from each category. Not really helpful if you ask me. But she did recommend, if I didn't want something particular, they were happy to substitute anything for anything! That means literally unlimited mix and match combos! I do actually love that. So my order was The Caprizza for 8.95 and the off menu item fried pickles with a chipotle aoli for dipping. Oh... and A large black tea unsweetened. The total came to $17.47. Super pricey for the food items I actually received. The flatbread was about the size of my coach wallet. And was literally sitting on the cardboard! No wax paper down... No interference between literally my flatbread and the cardboard that it came in! When they drizzle the balsamic over my pizza while it was inside the box the balsamic literally was on the cardboard.  I was not a fan of that at all and will definitely not be ordering the flatbread to go again. I did however receive enough fried pickles to feed two or three people. I got this as a to go order because I wanted to eat in my hotel room and do a little work. I wasn't really a fan of the to go order because the food didn't really hold up. (I think???? I mean I haven't ever eaten at the restaurant... So I assume....)   I would go back, and eat inside instead of togo. Maybe try some of their other items that looks pretty interesting... So definitely look for that in the next couple of days. I will update my review then. For now... I am at a firm 3 stars - disappointed :( )  ------------------------ Ok..... update! Went back  ( Wed around 7pm ).  ZOIE BLEW MY MIND! Super high energy, Awesome job on welcoming me, knew the menu AND helped me on sifting threw what I wanted and didn't want - with out confusing me or overwhelming me on my order options! Great job ZOIE! She could even had some reservations about a condiment that came on my recommended burger, called me out on it, and excluded it for me... good job AGAIN zoie!   I once again ordered to-go just to make it even... I ended up ordering chix on Broadway, my side was regular fries and I ordered a large black ice tea. ( see Togo order and sandwich attached ) when I opened it up it looked taken care of and nice and neat. After unwrapping and taking the first bite I was not disappointed! The sandwich was big and the chicken was hot, the coding was not too rough... As to mess up the roof of your mouth, you know what I mean people. The fries were hot and my ice tea was fresh. I was so glad to have a good experience with the food this time. I'd read all of these amazing reviews about it but didn't have the same experience as other people. This time it was much much better!  I gave them one more star because of the improvement of the food, and impressive attitude and knowledge of Zoie!! I look forward to coming back next month to see what the dining in experience is like.  -------------- Another update! I just received a message from Lana at skinny fats! She wanted to connect with me on my review to ensure that my customer experience was taken very seriously and was not taken lightly. I have to say I'm super impressed that she took the time to reach out to me and to offer me the opportunity to come back for a different experience. I had already gone back before I got the email... But it was super nice for her to extend the offer. GREAT JOB SKINNYFATS! That's the way to build a long lasting business!"}
{"text":"Love love. You just have to go Tried the one on warm springs last night and its not as good as Dean Martin location but it coukd have been a fluke?"}

{"text":"I had to go out of my way to try the new SkinnyFATS in North Las Vegas.  The artwork and ambience is beautiful.  Not to mention the place is huge!  I had the Quinoa and Curry On, which was delicious and hilarious. The booths were so comfortable! This location definitely knocked it out of the  park! They need to put one in Summerlin so I don't have to venture to get good food."}
{"text":"I am used to going to the location on Warm Springs and when I first tried this magical establishment a few months back it was awesome and they continue to produce. This location was smaller, but still offered the same incredible food. The line was long but well worth it. The staff was friendly and the vibe they have is second to none. I'm in love with their sandwiches and juices. The clever names of the items always make me smile.  Today it was smoke in a bowl on my list.  Delish!"}
{"text":"On a scale from 1 to ridiculously amazing...This place is in a league of its own ridiculously amazing.  The food, the vibe, and the staff are unparalleled.  #1 it is a creative food fusion joint with both indulgent items and healthy items.  The juices are fresh and well-priced and the liquid defense and punch are incredible.  The tu-nuts is so unique with a blend of hawaiian style poke in a boat like cucumber stick that is well-portioned and to die for.  Each week they make a different Eggs Benedict with tantalizing names and unforgettable flavor.  The servers are so friendly and attentive despite the long lines to each and every guest.  It is no mystery that this place is always slammed.  Thank you for consistently making our food experience enjoyable."}
{"text":"There's only a couple juices and smoothies and they're not very fruity. Looking for flavorful smoothies, not here"}
{"text":"A little spicy.  Wine and Beer prices are a little high.  Meat portions are small but rice is large.  Not really worth the cost."}
{"text":"It's finally open. I'm almost hesitant to give a good review because I don't want you people hoggin' the place. :)) The steak breakfast burrito is delicious. Going to come back and order all the tacos next time."}
{"text":"Skinny Fats ROCKS! Great healthy choices for those that care and some fat ones too. The only fall back is the long lines at lunch and brunch."}
{"text":"I CAN NOT EXPRESS ENOUGH HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS PLACE! The atmosphere is so pleasant and the food is so GOOD. The menu items are creative and delicious, and their juices are to die for. I love the truffle fries and this place is overall the best. Their customer service is always on point and everyone is so friendly. I hope this business goes far!!"}
{"text":"I tried the compressed carrot juice at the Yelp party and then when i tried Skinny Fats later that week the same carrot juice was $8.25 which I think is a bit pricey myself. That is like the price of a cocktail in a casino but it was worth it. Very healthy, hearty, organic food if you have time to stop in but I think other people in vegas would very much appreciate the value of the quality."}
{"text":"Yumyumyumyum!!! Finally got to try it after all the rave about this place! Came in around 1030am on a saturday and it was busy, as i expected! Service was top knotch and food was great! We loved everything! Even the freshly squeezed orange juice was great! Cant wait to come everyweek for our weekly brunch"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and love the ahi tacos and yesterday's experience was not not the usual. I rarely eat meat but after seeing a picture of a Meltdown I decided to try it. But what I got was not what was pictured. First the onions were supposed to be caramelized and mine were barely cooked; the nice toasted bread was slightly browned and soon turned soggy and when you see a picture of melted cheese wrapping around the meat and what you get is cheese that is slightly wilted because the burger is cooked I did start picking the burger start to make sure it was cooked. To say the least I was disappointed. Yes I should have returned it but when there is barely room to move around,it takes 10 minutes to get a drink refill at the counter and you are with a group of people; the odds of get your food back in a short moment of time wasn't going to happen. Will I come back? Probably. Will I order meat again? No, I will not trust that it will be cooked any longer than the ahi tacos."}
{"text":"Great range of delicious food with a nice atmosphere and quick service. Prices are good and there's an excellent range of healthier options available."}
{"text":"This place is really good. They have a variety of different food. It starts with one side being healthy and the other side being not so healthy. I would recommend the chix on Broadway! The sugar cookies with powdered sugar are really good when they are fresh and warmed up!   The seating isn't so good on a busy day between noon-3pm. The place is usually swamped! The specialty healthy drinks are okay. They all taste watered down in my opinion. It may be because I am used to juicing at home. I use the same ingredients as they do at skinnys so I don't understand... For some reason mine has a richer stronger taste to it.   Anyways I do like this place a lot because it is conveniently located. It also has a variety of different choices in food and I just seem to never get tired of this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times & I like it. Some food are hit & miss, but overall, everything is typically good.   Portions are pretty big, and the set up is a cross between fast food & casual restaurant. It gets pretty busy during rush hour, so try to avoid those times in the day.  Seating is first come first served (after ordering your food), but not everyone follows the rules."}
{"text":"Super nice employees, they all greeted us, explained the menu, and answered all the questions we had. I like how they had a healthy side and a happy side (which was the side with not so healthy items) it gives you a options between both. The food was pretty good kinda spicy but I will be back whenever I'm in Vegas. I'm glad my friend told me about this place, because we had no good place to eat at before we left to go back home. It's kinda hidden and hard to find but I recommend for everyone. (:"}
{"text":"Nice trendy, atmosphere, reminiscent of Venice Beach. Trendy minimalistic furniture and colorful murals on wood. Then, we get to the food, and it was enjoyable.  My two gripes are that 1. the fillet mignon on the egg whites was tough and chewy, 2. I requested scrambled eggs scrambled SOFT and they were HARD. I never send food back so we just left them.  A for effort and decor C for hard eggs and tough filet mignon."}
{"text":"The first two times I came here I fell in love with everything I ordered. The cluck moo, truffle fries and Thai spicy shrimp boat. The third time I came here it was okay. The steak in my cluck moo seems dry and over-cooked. The fries seemed a bit old and they didn't Have my Thai spicy shrimp anymore. I love how they have options for healthy juices but not sure if they're organic, probably not."}
{"text":"I came here recently on my lunch break. The place is cute but tiny. Totally packed. Waited about 45 mins for my to go order, as I was leaving I noticed they left out 1/3 of my order! I had to go back and wait another 10 mins for the missing piece. That leaves 5 mins to eat and get back to work lol. I got a healthy Cobb salad that wasn't too tasty... But I did enjoy the mini cranturkey burger.  I wasn't the only one who had a bad experience this day... Lots of ppl waiting and very unorganized for call ahead orders.  Maybe this was just a bad day... I will call ahead next time and give them another chance."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for the chance to try this place out. The first thing that definitely caught my eye was the ambiance. It holds a very neat, chill, and welcoming atmosphere. The place is overall aesthetically pleasing, artwork all over the walls, little strings of lights in the patio seating, and amazing music playing! The staff was also very welcoming, friendly, patient since my friend and I were undecided for quite some time. We ordered the Smoke In A Bowl, Truffle Fries, and the Rosemary Jane. They were all so good! My waffle was a bit cold, maybe due to the wait for the chicken to cook but it was still tasty. The truffle fries weren't completely drenched in truffle, which made it even more enjoyable to eat. My friend really enjoyed his Smoke In A Bowl, tons of flavor and vegetables that made the dish very pleasing to eat. It was an overall great experience! We sat outside and I couldn't help but be in awe of the way it was set up. Perfect place! Thanks for the friendly service. :)"}
{"text":"Best food I've had in a while without getting cramps or stomach ache while digesting. Great hidden place. But packed on a Saturday in a industrial area. I will continue to go back here.  AWESOME BURGERS."}
{"text":"I had a cheeseburger that was so delicious I forgot the name.  But everything was awesome. Had the chicken and waffles and they were excellent."}
{"text":"Man oh man!  UM dear SkinnyFATS, yes. This place is seriously a gem.  It's a cozy artsy little restaurant, kind of randomly placed between the airport & SpyOnLasVegas, which was pretty unexpected.  Anyways, you walk in [but first you take a couple selfies outside next to the big smiley face mural on wall] order your food at the counter & they serve it to you. I opted for the chicken & waffles, because in most food situations I'll opt to swing on the fat side [it's fine, I got a veggie juice after].  The chicken was perfectly crispy & very seasoned, and it harmonized seamlessly with the generously sized Belgium Waffle.  It was a large portion and filled me up.  Friendly service!  All the makings of everything I like, too bad there's not a location in Orange County :/"}
{"text":"Went last night 1/2 hour before closing.  Staff was awesome.  Place was a bit dark but cozy.  Staff explained in detail what they have to offer. (Our first time here).  We ordered: Ahi srirachi - bomb!  Ahi taco-san - bomb!  Meltdown - bomb!  Truffle fries - bomb!   Prices are low for the smaller appetizer sized bowls.  The larger plates are priced right on.   Over all food is awesome! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After a long and arduous weekend of dancing and partying (EDC), my group and I were ready to grub on some good food. Although we were en route to Bachi Burger, the line there was just too horrendous. Thank god for yelp, it lead us straight to skinnyfats.  SkinnyFats is the best of both worlds, you can get your super delicious, indulgence type of food that will bust your diet but make your tastebuds all so happy, or you can get a more waistline friendly selection that is equally delicious and satisfying. They have items ranging from the most delectable breakfast items to a more savory burger.   Pros: -good menu options and decent prices to mix and match your choices. -good serving sizes. -knowledgeable workers -options to either go healthy or indulge in your inner fat kid  Cons: -limited seating -first come first serve bar space or tables -not great for huge parties  I ended ordering a ahi srirachi taco and the slow boat to china. Although slow boat to china looked very small when it first arrived, to my surprise, the serving of chicken salad stuffed in the cucumber boat is actually quite substantial. Taste wise, I was very pleased and so was the rest of my group.   Next time i'm in vegas, I'll definitely drop by when I feel like getting my gluttony on."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a couple of the Skinny Fats around town.  This was my worst experience.  I ordered the Saint Piggy.  There was so much fat on the pork that it ruined the meal and I could not finish it.  My wife ordered a beer...$11...FOR A 9oz GLASS!!!  9oz is like half a glass of beer.  That's what you would pay at a ritzy club or a sporting venue.  Not Skinny Fats.  This is an absolute rip-off, Skinny Fats is a quarter step above fast food. And to top it off it was a 20 min wait just to order food and their credit card transactions are the type that tip-shame you.  They make you select \"no tip\" in front of everyone before you finish paying.  I don't think that waiting 20 min in line to order an over priced subpar meal warrants a tip, but I guess if they didn't tip shame they wouldn't get many tips at all.  I'm giving this a 2 star rating because despite how much I hated it, my wife said her meal was ok."}
{"text":"Had the balls 2.0 & Cranburkey w/ a Salted Caramel cookie ×2 I spent $40.00 for lunch! The food was not as good as it had been. Everything was off, Including the service! It's too bad. This was one of my favorite spots when I lived In area. They lost something when they expanded, \"Flavor\"! Food was so bland.  If I'm paying top dollar I have high expectations and they definitely were not met.  I was humiliated, because I ranted and raved about this place. I may try again next visit home. Ik must have ordered carryout 20 plus times from here. I don't know what is going on :\"}
{"text":"What is there to say but having the option to be healthy or indulge one day is awesome. can't go wrong with anything you order"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we will be regulars from now on! The food is fantastic. The burger I had, the Meltdown, was sincerely the best I've ever eaten. My son had the Sweet Cheese Us and said the marinated steak was amazing. I can't wait to go back and try everything else.  The staff were as incredible as the food. So friendly, full of information, attentive to any needs you have...I could go on and on. The atmosphere is friendly and fun.  The decor was, for me, wonderful. Very environmentally friendly. Bar stool bases were made from recycled palates, walls covered with reclaimed wood, and the cups can be taken home (dishwasher safe), or you can put them in the recycle slot. Even the sandwich skewers were wood instead of plastic.  There's something for everyone here, whether you want fish, turkey, chicken, beef or salad. Decadent healthy and yummy sinful fried food too. This place has an amazing concept, fabulous food, and fantastic staff. YOU'LL LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I love this place because it's equally a health spot and a place for a guilty pleasure all in one. My favorites on the healthy side are the sandwiches because they're very flavorful, filling, and good on macros. The Cranburkey and the Steakation are my favorites since they're hearty and satisfying.   The Sweet Cheese Us and the Cherry Popper are both super delicious on the Happy Side. The cherry popper particularly is very unique and I haven't really tasted a spicy and tangy burger like it anywhere else. The fried pickles here are pretty spicy (beware) but they are very tasty.   But the best thing by far here is unanimous. The Cookies. All their cookies are to die for. If you're feeling happy one day, you need to try them"}
{"text":"This place is anything but ordinary. Sorry to the staff if you had to mop up all my drool as I tried to finish reading the menu. Don't come here if you like the average burger, fries and a liter of cola (hold the spit). Juices, hip sodas, entres with high flavor impact in mind. Yeah, I don't normally write reviews but hory chet I had to give this place a shout out. This little hole in the wall is such a sweet place to swing by on our way back home. Definitely definitely definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Depending on what you get, the food can be really good or really boring. The creativity amongst the dishes is great though!  Also, the smoothies and juices are really good and refreshing."}
{"text":"An excellent locals enclave! All menu items are creative, tasty, and clean (well organize visually and don't leave you feeling like shit for eating it). Cozy eating area and dim urban ambiance that is easy on the eyes if you have a hangover (LOL, like that ever happens)."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now trying a couple of different meals and all of them have been good. The burger they have is still my favorite. I only knew about this place because of Charity Faith recommendation on her facebook page and positive people seem to lead to positive outcomes so I went. I would have given 5 stars but I have 2 gripes. They need a bigger place because they have a pretty good thing going and it seems like a lot of people are enjoying their experience there. My last gripe is I really dislike them serving things that have to be cut on pizza pans. If I have to cut a burger with a knife and it bottoms out to the pan it makes that chalk board screeching sound.  All in all a great place to eat, prices are decent.  I want to also say that the first time I was there it was busy and I see a lot of reviewers have been there when its packed. Sit with a stranger and stop being so walled off, you might meet your next best friend.  Changed my star rating to 5 from 4 since they now have nice plates and I eat here like once a week and we sometimes try new stuff they have on their menu and they don't have any food there that is anywhere near less that damn good.   Top 5 best finds in Vegas IMO!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in Vegas. Breakfast, brunch, lunch and/or dinner this place has everything to satisfy whatever you're craving. I have to get a Liquid Defense, which is a fresh squeeze juice, every time I visit, which is on the healthy side. If you want to do something on the happy side the cucumber delight with frozen yogurt is refreshing and delicious. They make a special eggs Benedict on Sunday's, it's different every week but always amazing. My favorite dishes are the pocket jacks, cranburkey, and ahi srirachi. Make sure to always check there Instagram or specials board when visiting for limited time dishes. Enjoy"}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.  DISLIKE  Not enough seating when it gets busy (which is a lot of times).  LIKE  The Skinny Q Pizza. The Naked Chix. The Fresh Morning Sandwich. The God Fries. The Cranburkey. Mr. Flapjack.  LOVE  The create your own shake. The menu concept. The Burger Benedict. The infused water. The Manbake Beefcakes. The chef. The different daily/weekly specials (esp. the steak/crab cake Benedict)."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice staff. Light food and I had a patty melt. If i had to change anything it would be location and a bigger space."}
{"text":"Good versus bad. Good versus evil. Healthy versus unhealthy.   all of those statements truly explains the name of what Skinny Fat means. Left side of the menu is all the healthy stuff and right side is all of the unhealthy items. it has everything your heart can desire. the good and the bad.   Ordered: Filet o fire- comes w a side - truffle fries - it was the right about of spiciness. the steak was not chewy. roasted jalapeños. right about of kick. truffle fries was on point!  Meltdown- comes w a side - sweet potato fries. the whole thing was super soft! loved the flavors and taste. sweet potato fries were also on point! Chicken tenders -kids menu comes with a side. - fresh fruit. my little one ate the whole thing!   Staff are really nice. Seats are first come first served. which kinda sucked because the place is small and you're like trying to hunt people down when they are done. or you give them the evil eye like fool, you're done eating hurry up and leave! food comes out at a very reasonable time. my little family would definitely come back the next time we are in town. we really enjoyed our food and the variety that they had. definitely no complaints as everything tasted so good on the evil/unhealthy side of things. i'm sure the healthy side tastes just as good. lol  Tips *Restroom available.  *Cash and credit card accepted.  *Indoor and one table for outdoor seating.  *Parking shared with other businesses.  *They have a kids menu.  *They make their own soda.  *Free self serve water. *dimmed inside."}
{"text":"Gotta love everything about this place. Great atmosphere on this new location with a lot of upgrades to their store. I am very surprised that this business hasn't expanded as fast as I expected it to when I first tried their dishes at the first location. I love how every meal is creative and unlike any other. This place has great personality and character. Brilliant concept of the names and the healthy vs. happy menus. I expect this business to grow and be franchised in many many states because of their business model. Put more effort into your business and you will stand out. Loved the #merica breakfast menu. I will be coming here atleast once a month. Good job. If you haven't been here yet, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Located in a random place and a very small tight space. SkinnyFats has some of the best food I have ever had here in Las Vegas. I could say that this eatery is on my top list at number one. A choice of eating healthy or happy is a cool concept. A great marketing strategy to attract people who sometimes workout and people who pig out. Guilty pleasure. I loved the turkey burger on the health side which was served with a special yogurt sauce. Nom nation. The truffle fries here are amazing too. Until next review. I need to try more of their dishes on both sides of the menu."}
{"text":"I AM OBSESSED! Being from LA this place really is a treat whenever I visit Sin City. The food is fresh and while it may look overwhelming on the plate, you leave satisfied not bloated! Skinny Fat's healthy options are perfect for those regretful hung over mornings. Their smoothies especially are delicious and give that extra little perk you need to get through your day! It's also a plus that it's in the suburbian part of Vegas making parking super easy and stress free!   The outside patio is super cute and has a nice relaxing vibe to it! Perfect place to sip on your smoothie and gossip with some friends about the debauchery of the previous night. I can't wait to visit again and finally satisfy my guilt-free cravings!"}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch with a friend it was fresh healthy lunch. Scrumptious food and clean environment and wonderful staff oh and military discount. Would definitely will return and recommend for families. Busy area in Costco parking lot and next to Best Buy. Give it a try sure you'll enjoy the experience.   Bon appetit'"}
{"text":"Go there all the time. Honestly, about once a week. Never been disappointed in any item in the menu. It's all delicious. Staff is awesome, environment is open and great. Soda is the good stuff, sweetened with all natural cane sugar, \" fancy soda,\" is what my childhood self would call it. I recommend the Filet o Fire with sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"Just tried this place after several recommendations, noticed on Instagram they started offering late night delivery.  Decided to take advantage of this.  I seen the Spudghetti on Instagram and it looked very appetizing, upon arrival it wasn't very hot whatsoever.  And the taste wasn't all I had hoped for.  Delivery driver was very polite, but there needs to be better means to allow food to be delivered fresh and not warm at best temperature wise.  Unfortunately after all the recommendations I am not entirely impressed.  Hopefully getting it at location might be better, as for the delivery service it needs some work."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and I have yet to be disappointed. Although I don't expect to in this place. It is a bit too small and you can easily miss it driving on dean Martin. The only thing I would recommend this place doing is to put something in front of their business to let people know it's here. It's so isolated."}
{"text":"Recommend the happy mess does not disappoint but add cheddar cheese but make sure you tell them to leave on the blue cheese crumbles they charge extra to add cheddar then take the crumbles off elevate it to another level entirely also really like there soda the diet cane soda is deliciously different end it all with a salted carm cookie"}
{"text":"Hipster Paradise.   If you like to overpay for small amounts of food this is the place for you. I ordered a steak salad that came on spinach, which first of all if you know anything about spinach it wilts pretty fast so that's pretty weak when not mixed. I'm 5'2\" and weigh 110 lbs, if I order a salad and it doesn't fill me up I think that says something about the restaurant, especially since I hardly ever leave a place without a to-go box. On to the steak.. it was sliced very thin and could almost be considered crumbled, not good quality at all. It was a very sad excuse for a $12 salad.   My husband's chicken sandwich came with his egg as ordered (lucky him), yet he still wasn't satisfied. He said it tasted very plain, basically no seasonings. He said RR would have been better, I didn't taste it so I don't know.  I ordered my salad the gentleman asked me if I would like to add avocado, I said yes, my husband ordered his, then we paid and sat down. After I get my food I realize they forgot my avocado, no big deal, I let him know. The runner instantly starts eyeballing our receipt on the table (which if I may add has no items listed just the total of $30), and lets me know that he can go double-check to see if I was charged for it and if I wasn't they would have to charge me. He comes back lets me know that we weren't charged and it'll be $1.08. Mind you my husband ordered a chicken sandwich that he's eating with his hands. They want him to dig into his wallet for $1.08 to put on a card.. I understand watching how much stuff you give away for free, but you also need to be aware of how you treat people.. we won't be back.  On top of everything with the food it was cramped (not busy), loud, cold, and just generally an uncomfortable place (quite literally, the tables were terrible). The fact that the cashier had to read us each soda nozzle because there wasn't a list and they are too small to see, was very unnecessary.   We paid $30.xx for a chicken sandwich and fries, a (pathetic) \"steak\" salad, and two sodas.   The best thing about that place was the soda."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favs! Staff is super friendly & the food is incredible! They have something for everyone!  They have healthy & super yummy  food! The smoothies are awesome! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Bomb Diggity with Truffle fries is my go to (you can add avocado to it too ;)  The water hits the spot as well!"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience.   They have menu items listed on their website and then shown on their boards that are not \"on the menu\" there were five items that I noticed.   Avoid if you are expecting what is shown on their website!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least 3 times a week. I recommend the tu-nuts and the happymess. Honestly I wish I had more time and money so I could eat there more. Also they have AMAZING customer service. Thank you, SkinnyFATS for making my lunch breaks amazing :')"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Customer service is always on point no matter how busy it looks. I've tried alot of things on the menu and have liked everything so far. Food never disappoints. One of my favorite local places for sure."}
{"text":"This creative spot mixed offerings that satisfy that fat kid in all of us and the health nut that wants a meal after a hard workout. With a decent amount of beers to boost the culinary creativity here really is something that elevates typical Americana to something a bit more satisfying.   The burgers are an easy win if you want something both filling and delectable. On this visit had mine with a side of sweet potato fries and a beer. Also ordered pickle chips to start with. They came out quick and fried to perfection. Another bonus is the cookies . Make sure to grab one if your wanting to splurge and add on a few extra calories. They have several locations in and around town. The other good thing is they are family friendly so bring the little ones and enjoy a meal out of the house."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is the kind of place that you can't really describe, you just have to go there to experience it.  The menu has two sides: the skinny side (healthy-ish food) and the fat side (drop dead delicious horrible-for-you food).  The concept is fresh and I find it amusing for some reason; the place makes me smile.  I also love the fact that they have infused water for patrons.  It's a nice treat.  But the food is hit and miss I've found.  I love the Siracha Ahi Tacos, but there is soooo much dressing on the slaw that it drips everywhere and makes the tortillas soggy.  The chicken and waffles was excellent.  My friend got the Cranburkey sandwich from the Skinny side and said it was very dry.  The burger my husband had was amazing.  It seems like the Skinny foods are the ones that I'm slightly disappointed by, but the Fat foods are pretty damn delicioso.  It's a neat little place that can get pretty packed.  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"You want skinny or fat? Yes, that's what they are special about! If you want health side, you go for skinny menu; if you want fat side, you go for fat menu. Both sides taste delicious. Cold pressed juice is also legit!   It's a quick service restaurant, staff are friendly.   If you still are not full, try their fresh cookies! :)"}
{"text":"Cool vibe and friendly service. I was greeted as soon as I walked in and the menu setup was pretty cool. This is my new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Awesome! Can't wait to go again! Great service food and atmosphere! Healthy side of menu is well thought out, they mix meats & fruits and have great sauces, very clever actually. Happy side of the menu is all the wacky things you thought of when you were drunk but never got to make because you passed out."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy. Love this place every time I come in! This tried the Zucc It. Great! Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"The place was nicely located right off of Dean Martin Dr. Right across from the infamous Mandalay Bay. I will say it right off the bat, the food here is mostly geared towards women, if you are a guy and you have an appetite I would suggest the local buffet, but if you are a woman then this place is all yours. Just think of it as a Panera with a different menu. Overall service was quick and friendly, and pricing is what you would expect from a place with such an eclectic menu. Guy + hungry run don't walk to the nearest buffet."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The vibe is great, the girls behind the counter were nice and helpful, and let's talk about the food!!! We had a party of 8. We all got something different and we all raved about how yummy it was! Good job SkinnyFATS!"}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone. Plus breakfast all day. Soup, creative bowls, sandwiches and sides. I love it! Oh and fresh juices!"}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place for a while and I'm glad I finally decided to go! Love that they have such a variety of healthy options. I went with the vegwich and it was so delicious, even better than meat burgers (imo haha) the sauce was good, just felt a bit spicy but nothing major. Can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"This is really a cool, hip place with something for everyone.  I wasn't really in the mood for what I ordered but was trying to keep it healthy and it had a LOT of onions on it so basically didn't agree with me but I would most definitely give it a shot again and read the menu with my glasses on!"}
{"text":"This place in Las Vegas was the bomb! Great food and reasonable prices. Wholesome and nice theme."}
{"text":"A delightful eatery with an enthusiastic staff and delicious fare. The servings are the right size and seasoned to perfection. This will be one of our \"go to\" places for an off-the-strip breakfast anytime we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is always packed! The food is flavorful. But I really only come here Bc my bf likes it. It's a bit pricey for what you get. I got him a hat for $27 though. So hopefully that souvenir serves as a good skinny fats replacement for a while."}
{"text":"Wow all the good write ups I'm wondering what they found   first of all there is limited seating so if you get there you will be fighting with other customers to get a table there is no preference order for tables   1st -2nd negative when you get your food it's cold had the classic burger and truffle fries cold lukewarm my partner had chicken and sweet potato fries cold   not a very good place to crowded overrated and definitely no order or semblance of order so you'll get what you get as far as seating   My advice stay away"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! The Shrimp Tacodilla tacos are to die for!!! It was the only thing i ordered and it was soo good. It has a flavor, not really that spicy, and the shrimp is cooked to perfection! Def have to come here because I'm surely going again!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and awesome food. Like I will get a snack from here just because the service is so amazing. You, SkinnyFats, are a major part of the service revolution! And the yummus and cucumbers are exquisite."}
{"text":"Their concept is creative. It's just like their name sounds- SkinnyFats... half of the menu serving up \"skinny\"  or healthy themed options- with the other half of the menu serving up \"fat\" or guilty pleasure themed options.   Here is what I've tried on my two visits..    Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis Bomb Diggity Sandwich  Liquid Defense Juice   First Visit... My husband I both ordered the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis and were both underwhelmed with this option. It was just alright and we both thought it was a bit bland. I guess we were expecting a more elevated version of this dish. I also ordered a juice to go since we were in and out in a hurry. The juice ended up being my favorite of the above items. I really like the 'Liquid Defense' which was a blend of orange, lemon, lime, basil, carrot, and apple. This was my first time trying basil in a juice and I really enjoyed the herbal kick it added.   Second Visit... I decided to come back and try something else with a co-worker for lunch. He ordered  the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis (against my advice)  and I ordered the Bomb Diggity, My sandwich was served on toasted sourdough bread with thick crispy bacon. I ended up adding avocado to it. Avocado makes everything better. I liked my sandwich and he liked the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis with extra syrup (which just shows you that everyone can have a different experience with the same dish- it just wasn't my thing).  The decor and vibe is super laid back and casual. It has a funky and artsy twist to a casual cafe. They have a sweet outdoor patio to soak up our Las Vegas sunshine and one can't help but smile when you enter their cafe. The service has been was warm, friendly, and welcoming when ordering at the counter. The staff was eager to suggest items to try. Overall, I really like the concept  will be back to get more Liquid Defense and sample other items off their \"Skinny\" menu."}
{"text":"I just love everything about this place!! My favorite thing that I always order is their smooth immunity shake. IT IS AMAZING. also, their salmon overload is the best. It's a great option for cutting carbs and still eating deliciously! Also, their sweet potatoes fries are amazing. A side to go order is easily shareable between 2-3 ppl!"}
{"text":"Best spot in Summerlin, great staff, great atmosphere. Amazing place to watch our Golden Knights!"}
{"text":"I really like this place and was excited for them to open a second location. Out of 10 things ordered 9 of them I have enjoyed! I have gotten to the point where I go there for one thing and one thing only. The Tu-nuts. It's ammmmmmazzzing-I will crave it on occasion. My fiancé will get something different every time and it's usually whatever  special they have going on at the time so I will sneak a few bites off his when he does. But the Tu-Nuts is a must."}
{"text":"I love their food and everyone there is friendly. The only thing is that the place is small, but it didn't take too long for me to get a table. My favorite is the meltdown on the menu!"}
{"text":"First time here and I will definitely be returning. Delicious food, good portions, and excellent service!! Love the atmosphere also!"}
{"text":"Great service, clean restaurant and the food is amazing!!! Ive had it all pretty much and I have to say that they're taco sauce is the best thing on earth (habanero crema). Prices are reasonable and the menu has so many choices. If you haven't been here yet, please do urself a favor and check it out! U will be happy u did!"}
{"text":"our visit was extra special today cuz Katie greeted us as soon as we walked in, she had a big smile (and those are contagious) she suggested a few items on the menu, was very pleasant, loved the attitude!! Those are the things I look for when I go out to eat, the way we get treated! I love this place and the fact that they have a great staff makes it that much better!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the biggest up and comer of 2014, and is sure to be growing into multiple locations in 2015.  I really really like their chicken and waffles called the Chix Waffadopolis. They also have other healthy choices that are tasty as well.  In case you're not aware skinny fats has a secret menu. Ask for the one eyed monster and see what you get, the result will surprise you!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive place to grab some good breakfast.  Great concept with the menu divide between healthy and less healthy.  I had the wake-n-bacon which was quite good.  You can't go wrong with bacon.  Good combination of flavors.  Only downside is I wanted it to open earlier, but we made it work.  Coffee was also really good."}
{"text":"The most polite and respectful staff I have ever seen, not to mention of the food, yummy in big portion, and the atmosphere that sound perfect. My family and I went there for breakfast three days in a row."}
{"text":"Excellent healthy food!!!!!! Great service all the time!  Love the food presentation and creative food concepts.  Everything is good here!"}
{"text":"I expected much higher quality food based on all the positive reviews. We found breakfast to be really underwhelming, including the coffee (lunch options might be better but we didn't get any lunch). All the breakfast items were bland and lacked seasoning and flavor: egg white scramble, sweet potato fries, cauliflower, even the protein waffle. The avocado toast was fine but nothing special. The inside of the restaurant was also too warm and packed but the ac wasn't turned on. Overall my 7 friends and I were very unimpressed and disappointed with the breakfast."}
{"text":"Great customer service. They have wifi (wasn't working very well for me but I was outside) they play great music. And the food and juice is pretty delicious. I recommend coming here."}
{"text":"My first 5 star review! The food in this place was fabulous---and what a great concept! You can either eat healthy or something decadent. I had the Blue Balsamic and the CauliFIRE-yum!"}
{"text":"I really like this place but I want to love it. I wish that they would not only include calorie but also carbohydrate and nutritional value on their menu and website. Those of us doing Keto or paleo need a little bit more information than calorie content. I've eaten here multiple times and the food is pretty tasty. Unfortunately I found out that some of the foods I thought were good for me to eat doing keto were full of sugar even though they seemed like they would be an appropriate Keto meal. I like the food it's good and the prices aren't too over-the-top. I just need to know more about how skinny and how fat the food really is."}
{"text":"I usually know what I want before I arrive to a place to eat. Thanks to the internet for that.   This time I couldn't decide. Looking at the menu I was advised by the lady at the front counter of a meatloaf like sandwich.   Great suggestion! I think this was a limited time option as I don't see it on the menu now.  Cool place. Not too expensive.  Definitely worth another trip."}
{"text":"Amazing ! I love this place, I'm always satisfied when going here. Very friendly staff and clean environment. I highly recommend this place to anyone. They have a happy side and healthy side on the menu and makes ordering easy."}
{"text":"Favorite (healthy food) restaurant. Amazing atmosphere and the staff was super friendly. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We would give this place 4.5 stars but their customer service pushes them up. Good, tasty food with decent enough prices. A great variety of food, depending on your mood. They get an extra 1/2 star for customer service. We placed an online order for pickup in the next hour. We got there and no order had been sent (not their fault, that's all corporate). We had our email confirmation and the crew there gladly made the food and comped us for our wait. They took care of us without us having to ask. And the food was quite good. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Over rated, my Sandwich was soggy and my fires cold.  The hangover juice was good though."}
{"text":"First time here and now I know why everyone raves about it!  We ordered for pick up. Service was fast and the food was amazing. We ordered a few different things but my favorite were the rice balls and the steak tacos! So so good!!"}
{"text":"This place is tiny. Parking is plentiful. We arrived on a Wednesday at 11:30 and were lucky to grab two spots at the bar. We were grateful for a breakfast menu served all day.  I couldn't decide, panicked and ordered the  cinnutella. I don't think I had ever had Nutella before and I'm not a big fan of chocolate. I'm not sure why I chose a dish that listed it as a feature but it turned out well. I really liked the way it complimented the sweet cinnamon bread & berries.  The bread was a little heavy on cinnamon & sugar but that's just my taste. The crispy carmelized edges were the bomb. My daughter ordered the chickawaffadopolis.  The chicken was so tender that it fell apart with a fork. If you Iike chicken & waffles, you will dig this dish.   Coffee was a medium blend, brewed fresh. Our food arrived quickly. We got a kick out of the salt & pepper shaker. Everyone in the staff we encountered was very friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"First of all, I can't remember when I had a cup of coffee this great!  I had Wakin' Bacon, which was an outrageous egg-avocado-bacon sandwich.  My friend had Steak Eyes, which sounds sorta ehhhh!  but was absolutely the bomb.  Ask for the secret menu, but don't tell them I told you about it.  Very nice people here.  Great customer service. DidI mention that their coffee is outstanding?"}
{"text":"Cool concept of healthy and happy but the food was just eh.   I found this place through looking for the most reviewed place in Las Vegas and SkinnyFATS popped up very often so I decided to check it out. To my surprise, it wasn't a sit down restaurant.. you order at the front and sit down with a number and they bring out your food.   I got the Cinnutella ($8.95) which was not that great. I tried my best to finish it but I did not enjoy it all that much. My friend got the \"More Cow Bowl\" ($11.95), that was okay but it seemed like something you could find at Costco in the frozen food aisle. The meat was okay though. My other friend got the \"Filet O Fire\" with Truffle fries ($13.95). It was recommended by the cashier, thinking it was a burger... but it was a sandwich. The look of disappointment. The truffle fries was probably the best part of the meal. The sandwich barely had any filling, it was mostly all bread.   Overall, there is nothing I ate at SkinnyFats that will make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Fairly impressed with the quality and presentation of food at this place. Well done.   The shrimp appetizer was delicious. The layering of flavor and the hot/cold of the shrimp and cucumber boat was a nice feature.  I would not have the \"Smoke in a Bowl\" again. The sauce was too ketchup-y, given a spicer sauce option, this dish could be quite good. I will return on my next short stop in Vegas."}
{"text":"I just love  this spot!!! The selection is so vast! If you desire good quality and healthy choices, then it's on the Skinny side of the menu. If you want a little heavier meal, you can select that from the Fats side! Both taste great  I can tell a lot of work went into this."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  the have the most amazing food ever! its awesome because you can either be a total fat ass and get something indulging or stay on the healthy side and get something light and delicious! Over all this place rocks! NEED TO TRY"}
{"text":"Sweet Potato Fries: get you some of these thin, crispy, sweet and salty sticks of bliss! I'm perpetually on the hunt for the best sweet potato fries in the world and well, my quest may have come to an end (Now what am I going to do with my life?!) There must be sugar in the batter, because mmmm-boy! taste like candy.   Also had the awesome Vegwich. It's big. Giant portobello mushroom cap, spinach, pepper marmalade, avocado, aioli. I could eat it every day. And might! Had a really great wheat bun that was a notch above all wheat buns. Yeah, it's huge and may be too much bread for some, but I thought it was perfect for this sandwich.   I'd stick with the burgers and sandwiches. And did I mention the FRIES. A friend got the Naked Chix bowl and it was just ok. Lots of rice, not a lot of chicken. I saw the tacos and they looked good, but can't attest to their taste. Not much seating and they stayed busy, for good reason"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place: Your wife can eat healthy while you pig out on everything else! HAHA  The chocolate chip banana pancakes are killer tasty and their burgers are awesome.  The place is small so it gets packed during breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours. Be ready to wait a long time to order and be seated (if you're lucky enough to find a seat). Most tables fit 2-4 people and the counter fits about eight if you're with a large group.  Staff has always been friendly and helpful when you're not sure what to try.  Check it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The sign \"SkinnyFATS\" is tiny, it actually says \"ColdPressed Juice\" or something like that. They have a good amount of seats but inside was full so we sat outside. It was much quieter and they have outdoor heaters too :) I ordered the Buff Chix and it came with truffle fries. It was good but not great. I think the buffalo sauce was a little too empowering and the chicken was pretty soaked in it. I also wish it was stacked on top of the fries cuz then my fries were soaked in buffalo sauce too. Other than that, the service was nice and the atmosphere was even better. I felt like I was in Cali or something lol. We need more hip places like this on the Southwest side."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Went here for dinner with my mom and we were so happy. I had the chix and greens and was pleasantly surprised. It was filling and full of flavor. I can't wait to go back the next time I am in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I had such a hard time deciding because everything sounded SO amazing. I ended up going for the buff chick and it was killer. Fresh, delicious, healthy options. Seriously so good. I'm from WA and bummed we dont have one of these. Will be back every time im I'm Vegas."}
{"text":"Tu-nuts : Bomb!   Truffle fries: super bomb!   Chix on Broadway: good, chicken breading needs some serious salt though   Love the different ketchups they have!"}
{"text":"Easy to miss if you don't look at the gigantic billboard right above the office park. Be sure to open the left door, btw. Food is very good quality and made with love. Juices are high quality and expensive. I had a breakfast from the skinny side that included an egg white omelette, filet, 9 grain bread and fruit. Very good. My pal ordered from the happy side and gobbled up applewood smoked bacon and eggs on a giant Hawaiian roll with potatoes. It looked good and he had it twice during our few days in LV. Worth the trip- especially if coming in a group and someone has a man bun. Then the group can judge him if he orders off the fat side."}
{"text":"I am waiting for my food ! I am seating feel like. Delicious reccomented 100 % ! OMG great food burgers."}
{"text":"What to do when you're waiting for your car to be serviced? Eat! Where? If in Vegas, don't miss Skinny Fats. Their food lives up to their \"Live Healthy, Live Happy\" motto. One word - yum.   I had the More Cow Bell with teriyaki filet mignon, cauliflower, portabellos, peppers and onions over egg fried rice. Awesome. Perfect balance of spicy but not too spicy, flavorful and healthy."}
{"text":"We were really disappointed in the food. For the price, the portions were small. The food was beyond bland! Really sad that our first trip here will be our last. The name should have been SkinnyBLAND. Seems like they do the skinny part ok but not the fats stuff."}
{"text":"Not the best brunch I ever had, but the employees were super nice and and menu was extensive. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Cute place in an industrial looking park. Look for the giant yellow happy face.  Bravo in the Steak Eyes, country fried filet medallions, buttery biscuits, gravy and perfectly cooked over medium eggs."}
{"text":"Ordered to go. Wanted a \" feb special bene \". They only have it on sundays -_-  why advertise something you don't have that day ? At least specify what day it's available. soo we went the next day. We ended up getting it and it was warm/cold. I don't know if it was really good or if I was really hungry lol. Overall the place is nice and food does look good. I think I need to dine in next time."}
{"text":"Food is Fantastic!!! Wish there was more seating but well worth the wait. Good choices on Healthy and not so healthy. Fun place to take a friend for lunch!"}
{"text":"Came in for a which brunch.  We had...   Hot Chix Salad Deep fried Risotto  Turkey meatballs Tortilla Soup Assortment of cookies Lemonade  We thought it was a full service restaurant but it wasn't, but do not let that deter you. The food was delicious. The service was also really good. People came to us a couple times during our meal.   The hot chix salad had deep fried jalapeños on it. Delicious!   The restaurant is supposed to be half healthy and half not healthy.  It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Healthy side WRAP SUPASTAR with chicken, avocado, pico & spinach on WW tortilla was DELICIOUS AND FRESH!  This wrap was huge and I got 2 meals out of it. My order way takeout...only live up the street.  The Chai over ice drink was AMAZING! This was a return visit for me.  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Hmm this is a review for their vegan menu. If you're a vegan... it wouldn't be the worst thing coming here but it's definitely not my first choice. They have quite a bit of options to choose from, but they all taste a bit too healthy for my liking. I love being healthy of course, but when I'm craving something sweet, savory, and delicious...healthy isn't really the word I want to use to describe my meal. I feel like their vegan options give you that classic \"oh yea that's definitely vegan\" vibe. I got the vegan BLUEBERRY FRENCH TOAST...oh my please do yourselves a favor and stay away from that. The bread they use is absolutely appalling imo. I don't understand why they can't just use regular vegan white bread or something, instead they went for a 100% whole wheat bran concentrated multigrain sand flavored bread. Just kidding I actually don't know what type of bread they used but it tasted like that to me. I believe they were trying to go for that healthier option for those who want to watch their weight but it kinda sucks that they automatically paired it with the only vegan french toast since not all vegans are into that type of taste. I also tried the AVOCADO TOAST. It was a little better than the french toast, probably my favorite thing ordered. But I have certainly had much better avocado toast elsewhere. Pita and hummus were average, although the pita was harder than I would have liked. The \"STEPHEN CURRY\" was a lot spicier than I thought it would be. It could be pretty good for those who like spicy foods but I'm not much of a fan. Overall, I think this place deserves three stars for at least trying to accommodate vegans with average tasting foods. I heard their non vegan options were actually pretty bomb but I'll never know."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I have been here twice & the other locations a few times as well! I appreciate that this is locally owned & all the food leans to the healthy/ eco friendly side. Donte & Anthony were top-notch and offered us 5-Star service from the moment we walked in to the moment we left! They answered all of our questions, anticipated our needs. They even went to the back to get the name of the Pandora station that was playing throughout the restaurant! Kudos to you both, your warm personalities and the customer service you provide! If I had my own business, you'd both be the type of guys I'd want welcoming my customers with as soon as they walked in the doors! There's so much to rave about, but let me also add. I RARELY drink soda or sugary beverages, but the soda fountain here has sodas made with cane sugar & extract oils. They are not too sweet, they are delicious! The bill with an appetizer, 2 main dishes, 2 fountain drinks & dessert was roughly $32.00 With places like this, I don't think I need to go to another chain restaurant anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Yumma dum-dum!!! So surprised by how amazing my dinner was here tonight! Great variety of vegan/ vegetarian/ Gluten free/ healthy/ meat indulging options on the menu!  They serve a small but decent beer selection as well! It is upscale casual. You order your food via line (kind of like Chipotle) but then servers bring your food & my goodness was it delicious! Cauliflower buffalo bites, nice to Greek you flatbread with chicken, fried veggies and truffle fries along with the Belgian ale Delirium. Not fancy enough where you'd want to propose to you significant other at, but definitely a place where the food will knock their socks off! This might be one of my top 5 restaurants! ( others would be Commanders Palace New Orleans, Yamashiro Los Angeles, Killer Shrimp, Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy!  What a cool place:)  Eat healthy or not healthy There food I Delish! You definitely need to try it! Pictures attached"}
{"text":"Food is great but seating is very limited. They need to work on service. There was five of us, three meals came out together. A few minutes later the forth and we were told they missed the last one but were preparing it now. Kind of embarrassing since it was a business lunch."}
{"text":"Went with my friend before a show.  It's incredibly small in here.  It was packed.  There was always a line.  That tells you something. It's good.   I wanted about 12 things on the menu.  I went with the spudghetti.  Totally neat concept and soooo tasty!  And fun to eat.  My friend got the mango chicken thing with brown rice.  And both entrees made our eyes roll back into our heads.  Foodgasm.    We have to come back for breakfast.  And dinner another time. And dinner another time...again.    I got the cinna schnapps smoothie or something like that. It was good but very fragrant and spicy...it tasted like how you'd think spicy baby wipes would smell.  I know that's not the most appetizing way to describe it but my friend said spicy perfume.  It was good...but I could only drink about 3/4 of it before the taste was overwhelming.  I got two cookies.  I have a sweet tooth.  I got the salted caramel which I wish I had eaten first. It was good, it didn't WOW me.  You want to know what did WOW me? Keep reading to find out!  The lemon blueberry cookies.  Cookies are not my go to dessert.  They are a last, desperate resort. The lemon blueberry cookie is seriously the best cookie I have ever had.  I think about this cookie as much as I would a really terrific long lost lover who left me for another and stole a lot of money from me.  So in other words I think about this cookie a lot. Wistfully.   And there you have it...the skinny on skinnyFATS from a fat chick.  Go forth and be healthy or happy..."}
{"text":"It's ok. People rave about this place and I've eaten at the other location before. My main problem is that the juices are way too expensive. This is the first time I've ordered a juice from here and will be the last. I asked to add 2 extra ingredients at $1 each and it was very apparent that neither been added to my drink. Normally I don't complain about things like this but it was already a pretty overpriced and honestly not good enough. $11 for a juice that didn't have the added ingredients is not a good way to sell your business."}
{"text":"Love the menu. Both sides of the menu are full of flavor; which is often hard to find at reasonably prices restaurants often. Only complaint is that there is not enough seating."}
{"text":"Soooooo good! Staff is friendly and welcoming, food is great! Aside from the limited seating (which even wasn't that big of a problem after asking a stranger to share a table ), absolutely no complaints!"}
{"text":"Like many things in life there's a good versus bad, and at SkinnyFATS they like to call it healthy versus happy. If you're in the mood for healthy then on one side of the menu you can find many tasty, lean options to choose from with the calories listed. In this case a protein waffle such as the Berry Strong  may fill your appetite. But if you're not counting calories then no problem because on the other side of the menu there is a list of delicious and savory items, such as the Meltdown with sweet potato fries (which I personally recommend).  The location has indoor and outdoor seating, but on a Sunday afternoon it's very busy so you can also order to go if you have trouble finding a table. The staff is very friendly and the service was quick. And they have a 10% military discount which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Really close to the airport which was a plus. Food was quick and delicious. Loved the concept of having heathy options or not so healthy options. Lots of choices. I tried the protein pancakes which we great and big also tried the shrimp taco soo good! The Nutella French toast was one of the best I've had the texture and flavor were on point! Service was great and everyone was very friendly!"}
{"text":"A great little spot off of the main strip - they have such a unique menu.  Half of it is \"skinny\" a.k.a. healthy food at the other part is \"fats\" which they call their happy menu.    We got one healthy item and one happy item.  I ate most of the happy item (obviously) and it was their brie french toast.  It was very good (if you like brie which I certainly do!).   Overall, I recommend coming here!  It's out of the way but they over a very good and unique menu."}
{"text":"Trying the infamous \"Tu-Nuts\" on the happy side suggested by Ashley and Trillion! Best service I had in a long time, it's refreshing :)"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and very fun. I really enjoyed the interesting menu items. It is not often that you get to see such unique variety in healthy items. Everything tasted fantastic. My only complaint, I wish they had more seating."}
{"text":"I came here based on Yelp reviews. The restaurant is small, but inviting. The cashier was friendly and she gave me a small introduction of the menu: you have a \"healthy\" side and a \"happy\" side. Honestly, I couldn't care what I got because I was just hungry.   Hubby and I ordered the truffle fries, the Arrabbiata nights flatbread and the Pimp Shrimp. When we finally received our order, it was pretty sad looking and the portions are pretty pathetic. The Pimp Shrimp is on the \"shareables\" section and it looked like it is an appetizer for one person. The taste of the shrimp was good, but it wasn't anything special.   The flatbread just wasn't good and not worth it at $8, $2/slice. The truffle fries were ok, but can you really mess up fries and adding truffle oil? The total of our bill was $24. Overall, I know I can find really great food (healthy or not) for $24 for two people somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal, but a little pricey and a little small seating areas. Friendly is the staff and creative and delicious is the food...definitely worth a stop: my suggestion \"risotto balls with corn and spinach\" (crunchy on outside, creamy on inside and corn and spinach bring saugy)!"}
{"text":"The food was just WOW!! Shared the buff chix & sweet cheese us with a warm chocolate cookie (a little cheat). Everything was delicious & cooked to perfection! The place was very busy & I can see why. Service was very friendly! Would 100% be back! Please open a NW location!"}
{"text":"Yay!! It's finally opened! Went in around 11am. Not very crowded...yet! I ordered the chickawafadopolis, my friend ordered a breakfast wrap & they allowed her to customize it. Cashier was trying to figure out the the best way to enter it so it makes sense for the cook (I'm assuming) & a couple other employee came over to assist to make sure she got exactly what she wanted. Great start!  Food was very good. Lots of breaded chicken fingers on a perfectly cooked waffle drizzled with syrup.  The restaurant looks awesome, so fun, clean, bigger than the Warm Springs which I really liked.  All the employees were friendly & attentive.  By the time we left, there was a line for lunch.  Can't wait to go back & try something new!"}
{"text":"Expensive but worth it. While it's not necessarily healthy food, there's a healthy menu and the \"happy\" menu. We went all happy all the way except for the fresh squeezed juice (will run you about $8-/cup but the cup is generous). They used to deliver but not anymore. Sweet potato and truffle fries are both must haves."}
{"text":"I was so impressed with the service here. My boyfriend and I couldn't stop raving about it. The employees are so nice. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and asked if we've ever been there before. As newcomers, the menu was completely explained to us & we were so amazed by the the overall concept.   The menu is split into two section: happy vs. healthy. Healthy obviously means much healthier food choices, whereas happy has a few more calories. My boyfriend went with healthy and I decided to go happy (no shame)!  I got the cherry popper which is a burger & when I say I did not put it down the whole time I was eating... it was that good.   Such a unique concept of a restaurant! Will for sure be back soon."}
{"text":"Oh WOW!!!  Awesome place. Tucked neatly into an industrial strip. From the window seat, you can see planes coming at you that just lifted off (yes, please stay up there where you belong) and Mandalay Bay. Place is packed with good natured folks. Coffee is excellent, (even with two shots)!  Food ... BAM!  Scrumptious.  Great little out stop to start the day."}
{"text":"I've been hearing all the hubbub about Skinny Fats and ended up at a meeting right around the corner, so I decided to see what's what.   It was PACKED on a Tuesday at around noon which was a good sign. Once I got up to the counter (3 ladies had given up and walked out- they were not fans of the \"first come first serve\" way of ordering), I placed my take out order.  My biggest gripe is the obvious. The space is way too small for there crowds, and there is nowhere to wait for your food. I felt like I was either hovering over the people seated and eating or right in the only way in or out of the back of house. It was total chaos in there.  Once I got my food back to the office is was good enough, with the exception of the Truffle Fries. The same style of fry the McDonald's serves (skinny) with WAY too much truffle oil. Not a fan- if I make it back I won't order them again.  I'd like to give it another try and see what the breakfast items are like. If I find myself out by the other location I'll pop in, but this didn't make the list for intentional journeys."}
{"text":"so awesome to have a healthy low cal protein berry waffle that was so delicious! staff was soooo warm, engaging and helpful....such a great concept"}
{"text":"Food is good but the skinny doesn't feel all that skinny. I choose Greens and Proteins over SF all the time. Their juices are great, though."}
{"text":"great food but the service was bad. I ordered food for pick up and i was told it was only going to take 15 minutes and I ended up waiting for almost 40 minutes so I asked to get my money back. They took another 5-10 to get back to me. On top of that they didn't even give my money back the girl didn't listen and still insisted on giving my food."}
{"text":"I LOVE the idea behind SkinnyFATS. The way the menu is split by 'happy' treats and 'healthy' treats means there is no need to compromise with where you go with your friends or family! Someone's watching their waistline but you want to indulge? No problem! And the choice is great!  I personally love the location in Blue Diamond because there's a lovely shaded outside area which is so peaceful! Customer service is great, portion sizes are generous, only issue is when it's peak time, it gets VERY busy and sometimes you have to share tables with other diners and remind the staff that you ordered a drink that hasn't arrived 15mins in."}
{"text":"There is no doubt that the food here is good.  I would come back regularly if it was not for the high school atmosphere.  I feel like I should be in here with a backpack and light up sneakers.  I feel like I'm way too old to be here and I'm 26.  There's just something about eating in a place where it seems like everybody gossiping.  I don't have anything against younger kids but it's just too many hipster kids to deal with."}
{"text":"Been here once while visiting Las Vegas. A great concept, that I hope they bring to New York. The food was great. They have a skinny side (healthy) of the menu and a fat side. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that they don't have a calorie listing, so you really don't know how healthy, the healthy side is."}
{"text":"Bomb and bomb! Always crazy busy but so nice and the food is excellent!!!  Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome! I like to try something different every time I am there. The only down side is that sometimes the employees are overwhelming. Other than that, the place is very unique and delicious."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to give this place the props it deserves. Been here twice on the recommendation of my local friend, and usually on the day I am about to leave town hung over AF. This is place is perfect to replenish all those calories you lost in Vegas due to extreme binge drinking and simply forgetting to eat.   The menu comes LIT, and beyond LIT. If you want health you got it, but the fat options is really where it's at if you want to get your brain functioning somewhat before your drive back on the 15.  I got the waffles, and the eggs that look like a smiley face. Don't remember the specific names but look at the Yelp pictures and you would figure it out.  The food melts in your mouth. The coffee options are on par with your private hipster coffee shops.   This particular location is perfect for you to get back on the 15 and head home after you tear up your plate. Its going to be my new tradition from now on when I leave Vegas."}
{"text":"This is most definitely one of Vegas' best hidden gems! Even with use of gps my friends and I had trouble finding this spot, but boy are we glad we did!   Their menu has multiple options for the health conscious folk & those who don't give a phuck about calorie content alike, and that's what makes this place so incredibly awesome! Definitely some of the best food I've ever had, and I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Place is tiny and there is always a wait. It's self seating so you have watch out for a table like a hawk. Ordered the burger which came with sweet bun not to my liking I don't like having a sweet hamburger! Also ordered one of their juice drinks tasted watered down. Would not go there again even if I'm in the area  How can this place get 4.5 stars! Sometimes yelpers disappoint me!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been there twice and I can't believe how great the food is here. The atmosphere is amazing and the people are very friendly. Their food is always delicious and even though this place gets really fun, they do their best to make sure everyone gets their food in a timely fashion. Is you visit Vegas, this is a gem you must visit!"}
{"text":"As much as I don't want to be labeled as a hipster, I would gladly don a pair of super skinny jeans, thick-rimmed glasses, and toms to belong here. This place was pretty awesome with its very unique and creative menu.  I had a portobello cheesesteak (vegetarian) sandwich with sweet potato fries and a beet/kale/soy/yogurt/and other non-traditional juice stuff shake. Yes, shake! It was surprisingly and pleasantly delicious...the shake and food. The atmosphere was so hip that I couldn't help but feel hipster...but not awkward...just cool. So much character.  It's in a really strange location with random other shops...not shops...more like industrial suppliers. And it's really small...intimate. But the ppl are super nice, patient, and friendly. And it's clean!   Definitely a new local fave!"}
{"text":"Great casual place.  I've eaten there three times and each time the food is good and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This was our first food stop on our first trip to LV, based on the recommendation of the Enterprise rental car attendant when we were driving out of the lot in our Mustang Convertible (toot-toot!)  Great rec, dude-whose-name-I-can't-remember!!  Bulletted thoughts:  -Super-duper friendly staff -Clean, modern decor -Filled with locals, as it sits in an industrial park just off the strip--who knew such \"hipness\" existed in a non-descript chunk of the desert? -Huge portions of food   -I believe we both ordered off of the Skinny side and were not anywhere near disappointed -Husband's \"fat\" side treat was 86'd, so the wonderful staff member suggested a substitution off of the skinny side---again, no disappointment here. -They've got your coveted hippy-dippy juices and health-food-based drinks right along side some good old Diet Coke, milkshakes and beer, hence SkinnyFats.    Woo Hoo!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fun!  SkinnyFATS is a one stop solution for any craving healthy or not. The food is delicious and the presentation is neat and fun!"}
{"text":"Not as expected. Curry was dry. Tomatoe soup tasted and had the consistency of marinara sauce. Truffle fries were really soggy.  Sorry guys. Wont be returning"}
{"text":"The more I come here, the less I am impressed. I am usually a creature of habit when it comes to certain things, take an item on a menu that I fall in love with. When I try to venture out and get something different, I usually kick myself for doing so. Case in point, my experience here. I started following them on Instagram awhile back, and the food pornography they put on is off the charts! I had to try the Slow Boat to China, Asian chicken salad, slaw chee in a cucumber boat w/almonds, teriyaki & spicy yo-aoili. This quickly became my favorite menu item. To really confuse my taste buds, I shared the Drunken Monkey Pancakes, buttermilk pancakes, maple glazed bananas, graham crackers, marshmallows, chocolate w/applewood bacon. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but this was too much, even for me. One bite was enough.  Ok, go ahead and throw in an order of your famous truffle fries. Now that's what I'm talking about. Those were really good, as well as the sweet potato fries.   The next couple times, I'd tried to stick to the \"healthy\" side of the menu, I tried the Cranburkey SF turkey burger, arugula, tomato, red onion & cranberry basil yogurt on a honey wheat bun w/side. It was really plain and boring, even with the cranberry basil and onion, I ended up putting the slaw chee on it to give it some flavor.   Last time I was there I ordered the special of the day which was Chicken & Waffle Chowder. Exactly as it sounds, it was really gross.   But what has really left a sour taste in my mouth was my experience with the delivery service. I decided to order online for delivery, I order my food, check out, and it gives me a total. Well about 20 minutes later I hear my email alert go off on my phone, so I check my email, and it is a confirmation of my order, but with a $10 fee added for delivery. No where on the online ordering does this state this fee, and it was not what I agreed to when I \"checked out\" online. I called immediately to cancel my order (I live 7 miles from SkinnyFats, I wasn't about to pay that) but I'm told it's too late to cancel, so I tell him that I will pick my order up. So I write a \"tip\" on the page alerting others of the delivery fee that is not stated, and I get an email from Charity pretty much pressuring me to remove the tip, which I relunctantly did, and I wish I hadn't."}
{"text":"I'm giving Skinny Fats 4 stars because this place is a zoo. My husband and I came here on a Sunday and I thought I was going to have to fist fight somebody to get a table. However it is a cute little place and the food is really good. So if you don't mind having a stranger sitting on your lap while you eat, then this is the place for you. Side note-they have a \"secret menu\"- you can view it online."}
{"text":"This place never fails to satisfy my every food related desire. Truffle fries are a must. Burgers are awesome. Bowls all taste great. Ive had 90% of the menu over the course of a year. Not a single dish fell below WOW level! Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"My teriyAhi sandwich was dry and overcooked. Tasted like dry chicken.  Was expecting more since the reviews were good, but was disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot when I'm looking for a guilty free, delicious meal. Everything I've tried has been absolutely amazing! The staff is always prompt and friendly, the atmosphere is upbeat, happy, and very clean.  So many times I've gone in here with the intention of eating healthy but most times the other side wins lol. Their  chicks on broadway sandwich might be the best chickens sandwich I've ever had btw! Absolutely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I first discovered SkinnyFATS at the 2013 Bite of Las Vegas and enjoyed it so much I sought out their brick & mortar establishment soon thereafter.    First, let me say that I am glad they opened a second larger location a few miles away from this one!  While I have enjoyed everything I've ever ordered here, it's just a pain coming to this location.  It's not really conveniently located near anything, the very limited parking is a bit of a nightmare, and there is a perpetual line to order, sometimes so long that it's out the door.  Unfortunately, once you actually do order, the seating is limited to about 8 tables and a bar along the window so you're usually left awkwardly holding your number and hoping someone finishes so you can snag their table before your food comes.    This trip I ordered the Smoke in a Bowl ($10.00)- Agave BBQ chicken, peppers, onion & pineapple over brown rice w/black bean salsa & cilantro lime yogurt.  This is the first time I have ordered this and I Loved it!  It looks more like Disaster in a bowl, than Smoke, but it tasted like Awesome in a bowl!  All the acidic flavors blended so well together with the yogurt and the large chicken tenderloins were juicy and delicious.  I would definitely order this again.  My friend ordered the Naked Chix add avocado ($7.50, plus $1 for the avocado)- Seared chicken breast in mango basil sauce over brown rice, w/cilantro yogurt.  I have ordered this before and enjoyed the slightly sweet chicken, but I think my bowl was a far more satisfying option.  She was still hungry when we left.  Some other items I have tried and loved in the past were the CauliFIRE, Chix on Broadway, Cherry Popper Burger, and the Sweet Potato Fries.  All solid options in my opinion.  A note: They used to carry Coke products, and their online menu still reflects that, however, they switched to Boylan products a while back, but their unsweetened Passion Iced Tea is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Love this place, best chicken and waffles!! The staff is always kind and the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"I've tried a variety of menu items here including the: TBLT, God Fries, Shroomin' Philly and chicken & waffles. Out of all those items I think I enjoyed the God Fries the most while everything else was okay. The God fries had chicken, feta and other things that made a nice contrast of flavors and textures. If you order the Shroomin' Philly, just note that it is vegetarian because there is no beef in there at all. You might be better off ordering the Phatty Philly even if it is on the Happy Side. I was deceived by the picture and thought there was meat until I started eating the sandwich. The chicken and waffles was pretty standard, but definitely no wow factor. Make sure to ask for the maple syrup on the side because there was a little bit too much for my liking. I haven't ordered these items but tried them from another person's plate:Tu nuts, Ahi Sirachi tacos, and Naked chicks all of which are very tasty and I highly recommend! If anything look at the Yelp pictures and if it looks good then it should be good.   People talk about a line, but I guess that's only during the lunch hour rush because I've never encounter it on my past 4 visits. Ambiance is awesome as you can already tell from the pictures, this place is definitely trendy even the signs for the male and female restrooms crack me up. If you haven't been here yet, you gotta try it especially if you're on that \"I eat everything healthy except my cheat day\" diet."}
{"text":"Great concept in offering food for those with special dietary needs like vegan and gluten free without skimping out in taste.  My husband and I didn't need it, but it was nice to see this option for those who do. The place is located in an industrial strip mall with no other restaurants around it. You can't miss the place though due to the graphics used for their signage. Inside they offer a few counter seats and less than ten tables. We came during a busy Saturday after Black Friday and there was a line congregating all the way to the outside. You can peruse the menu while waiting in line but it moves pretty quickly.   I ordered a Classic Burger with a side of Yummus (their play on words for hummus) served with cucumbers (you can opt for pita bread as well). I picked my side so you don't have to get that combo. I substituted their SF sauce (which looked like a thousand island based sauce and pink) for mustard. Mine also came with a fried egg (I asked for sunny side up). My husband ordered the chicken and waffles with fried eggs on top.   My burger was good but nothing special. I really enjoyed the hummus though- thick, yet creamy and with a good lemon flavor.   I think my husband's dish was way better.   Unique concept and pretty creative dishes made for a cool visit. It is far from the strip but there is a billboard right above the restaurant to help you locate it. Despite its odd location, it is super busy so I think that is a testament to its popularity.   Service quick and friendly. You order at the front and take a number, find a seat and they bring everything out to you. There is cucumber and lemon flavored spa like water for self serve in paper cups, if one desires."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance!!! Nice little joint with plenty of seating and the staff is very friendly.  The coffee is strong, but good! I love that there are so many options on the menu and good prices. I had the Cluc Moo...delicious, especially when I added Cholula on it! I devoured it! Hubby had the Power Berry (or something like that) waffle, it came with orange agave drizzled with berry sauce, topped with fresh berries and turkey bacon. He really enjoyed it all! The turkey bacon was delicious! I need some of that for home!  We REALLY like this place, wish they had one in Arlington/Mansfield, TX! Hint hint"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in how much they raised their prices. This used to be a regular spot for us but not anymore. The food is still awesome though."}
{"text":"Just love this place! For those who love ahi tuna, their TeriyAHI is amazingly delicious especially if you add avocados and jalapeños. It's a must try!!! Usually I never could finish my sandwich, but with this, I totally \"devoured\" it."}
{"text":"'Ordered what I thought would be a simple dish - chicken and waffles.   Waffle was cold and dry.  Chicken was overcooked and bland.  Sent back once for them to remedy, but came back exactly the same.  Orange juice was good,  All were overpriced.   'Never again."}
{"text":"Stopped by after our flight into Las Vegas - came with hungry stomachs and left satisfied. Plenty of parking at night (we arrived around 8PM), as it seems to be located in a commercial office complex. The large billboard was definitely helpful in locating the restaurant, which has a rather unassuming front.  The menu is slightly overwhelming, as there are two sides: Healthy and Happy (less healthy), with lots of interesting options. Ordering is done at the counter, and the service was great.   I ordered the Chickhumm, which was kind of bland, but it might be my fault for ordering from the Healthy side. My brother noticed that the main scent coming from the sandwich was the sprouts. Although underwhelming, it was still a huge portion.  I also got the Caulifire (cauliflower buffalo wings) appetizer which was very spicy and tasted slightly pickled - not bad! I sampled my family's orders: Naked Chix, Hot Chix, and Sweet Cheese Us and they were all pretty tasty.   Giving five stars for the exciting menu with lots of options, the fast and friendly service, and the huge portions of healthy-seeming decent food at decent prices."}
{"text":"Out of all the places I've tried, I really wanted to like it.   Atmosphere: as a group of first timers, we were a bit confused. The space feels a little tight, especially if you take awhile to decide what to eat. Grab a seat and take your time, then when you go to the counter it'll be easier to order. I like the vibe of the place. The decorations are different from what you usually see at other places.  Food: I got the chicks on broadway sandwich with truffle fries. I thought the sandwich was okay. I feel like it lacked some taste. I actually liked it more as leftovers because the sauce was thicker from being out. The truffles fries were decent. If I wanted fries, I think I would have just got the regular ones.  I do wish that they had a better iced coffee selection.  I think id try this place, but get something different. Maybe something from the healthier side."}
{"text":"When we came to SkinnyFATS I was convinced that I would need to order on the 'Fat' side of the menu. Who wants to order healthy food at a restaurant? Well, after seeing pictures of some of the 'Skinny' side of the menu, I took a chance, and was so happy to be surprised!  I ordered the Applebottom french toast and it was delicious. I seriously could not believe that it was under 400 calories! A friend ordered the Ahi Tuna sandwich and also really enjoyed her 'Skinny' meal! The men in our lives (of course) ordered off the other side of the menu and liked their meals just as much. The truffle fries that I stole off my husband's plate were amazing.   We also ordered a pitcher of mimosas made with fresh squeezed orange juice. They were so, so good. If you didn't have some friends to split the mimosas with, though, it would be a bummer - they only sell them by the pitcher!   This location was pretty crowded on a Sunday afternoon, so if you're coming at that time be prepared to sit outside. The price point is also a little higher than other places in the area, but it's worth it for sure if you have people that would like to eat healthy while eating out!"}
{"text":"Overall SkinnyFATS was just ok. The pimp shrimp was really good. The mean bean veggie burger had ok flavors but was very dry.  The curry bowl was bland. One would expect big flavor from curry noodles, but this dish was lacking for sure. The customer service was excellent though and I liked the style of the interior."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! My friend and I came here for my first time and his second time today, and we ate so much! Everything on the menu sounded so good, we couldn't decide what to eat, so we got everything!    We got...  The Meltdown: fantastic, filling sandwich with perfectly cooked meat, and tons of cheese melted together. The bread was also perfectly buttered and grilled to crunchy perfection. Came with tasty truffle fries.  Nice to Greek you: most delicious flatbread pizza I've had anywhere. There are so many flavors in this, it's definitely a must try.   Cheezy peezy: they aren't lying when they say this is cheesy. It was good, although I wish we had out style meat on it to go with all the cheese.  Yummus: your standard hummus appetizer. Was good, though the pita was a little to hard for my liking.   Bleu balsamic: steak and bleu cheese perfection! Tender cooked beef and sweet tomatoes and red onions to go with made this one of the favorites.   Black cherry soda: get it! It tastes like a slurpee but better!  This pace is amazing, I can't believe it took me so long to come here. I'll be here all the time now!"}
{"text":"Expectations vs. reality - The photos of the food posted looked amazing, so we thought to swing by for a quick lunch. We ordered the buffalo cauliflower and chicken soup to start, then the 'Smoke in a Bowl' and fried tuna/steak tacos.  Photos looked amazing, but the food was just terrible.  Everything was overly salted and a complete lack of care was given to most of the items we ordered.  The cauliflower itself was ok, but then it was completely drowned in a super salty buffalo sauce. It became buffalo sauce with a side of cauliflower.  The chicken soup was overly salted, but if you took a sip of water in between each bite, it was actually pretty decent.  The Smoke in a Bowl was hands down the worst thing I've ever ordered from any restaurant I've ever visited. The rice was not rinsed, so in the gigantic mountain of rice (2 to 1 rice to actual meat/veggie ratio), the rice was just one gelatinous glob. The actual dish itself looked nothing like the pictures. It looked and tasted as if someone took half a tin of tomato sauce, and cooked bell pepper, onion, pineapple and chicken in it for a couple minutes, then just spooned it over the rice. Where's the 'smoke'? This is the literal embodiment of Yelp catfishing.  The tacos were again, just incredibly oversalted. By the time the tacos arrived at my table, the fried tuna batter was soggy, soft, and absolutely disgusting. The steak tasted like someone spooned brining liquid over it, then covered the entire thing with a handful of chopped radish.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Great variety and really healthy. Had the spicy ahi tuna9Tu-Nuts) and The Ahi Sriacha sause. So good, we ordered for a big group with no errors. Will be back"}
{"text":"went to eat a late dinner 9/30/2015 around 6-7pm. the cashier was one of the nicest people you can meet. had a tattoo on her left arm, cocoa complexion and was very energetic and helpful. sorry i forgot her name but he knows who she is lol. so i ordered the ahi soft tacos, ahi tempura tacos. it is about the 3rd time i have tried them and let me tell you they are some of the most delicious tacos you can ask for! lots of flavor, great quality seafood all the way. we also had the sweet potato fries with the spicy aioli sauce which were fantastic and goat cheese pizza flatbread which did not dissapoint. try the jalapeno ketchup if you dine in as well. i'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the fact that this place is a great compromise for friends, family, and couples that aren't on the same kind of diet. While I ordered the Drunken Gypsy french toast (or something like that), I would order more from the skinny menu if I could go here regularly. (I stopped here on a road trip.) The french toast was delicious and the girl  at the counter was very friendly and helpful.  Also, the smoothie with froyo was bangin."}
{"text":"Love this place. whatever your in the food for they will have something for you. menu is separated into two different parts so if you want to eat clean they have a whole side for that or a cheat meal the have the whole right side of the menu . options options options :)"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is an awesome breakfast/brunch/lunch place. The menu can be confusing but the food is worth it!! I would suggest coming during the week for it can be busy, overall SkinnyFATS is an awesome food choice and my whole group agrees!"}
{"text":"This is 1 out of 4 locations in Las Vegas. It has very spacious seating with a huge outside patio area, which can accommodate the rush of people during lunch time.  They have seemed to master the art of food, marketing, and interior design. I've been to their other locations and the food has been consistently delicious. It's priced correctly and the portions are generous. For the beginners, on the left column of their menu you'll find their healthy option. Don't skip out on this side because their healthy dishes also taste amazing! And on the right column you'll find their higher calorie dishes. Also, take a look at their small screens while you're in line because they showcase other items that are not found on their regular menu. Lastly, don't forget to top off your dish with their homemade hot sauces!  As for their marketing, their skinnyfats design/merchandise is so creative. Their logos look cool on the gear they wear. The bright colors all around and the simplicity of the happy face logo bring a sense of happiness to your eyes and stomach.  Their interior design has always been spot on & this location totally shows it. Their artistic murals, mixed medium for the tables and chairs, and their unique bartop seating is so inviting and comfortable that it calls for a cool hangout place while sipping their alcohol. This location also displays massive Samsung flatscreens.   If you haven't tried their food, I suggest you do whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I heard about this place fro a co-worker and thought I'd give it a try since it was 5 min from work....  From the outside you wouldn't think any special about it, being in an industrial building complex, but once you step inside the restaurant, however small, it has it's own identity.   You line up and order and have a seat while you wait for it to arrive. The menu confused me a bit, it took me a while to figure out that the healthier options were listed on the left and the 'fattier' selections were on the right. I decided to go with the Chix on Broadway sandwich (asked to have the chicken tossed in buffalo sauce), an order of sweet potato fries, and a fresh strawberry lemonade (which could have been sweeter).   Food was DELICIOUS! They even have specialty Heinz ketchup, balsamic & jalapeno, and I love jalapeno and it went perfect with my fries. I ate every single bite! I'm definitely coming back  to try the other items, especially the breakfast which seems to be served all day."}
{"text":"Best food ever!! Can't get enough of the chicken and waffles and the cherry bomb burger!! Oh and can't forget the Nutella shake. Everything I've had is amazing! Great place to take friends"}
{"text":"wide variety of deliciousness that one can only savor with every bite. prices are reasonable and the ambiance is simply awesome!  tried the chicken/waffles yesterday and it was really good. waffles were soft and yet crunchy, chicken were tender, fresh and juicy!  today, im having the nice chix. the mango salad combined with yogurt dressing on the side was fabulous! seared chicken is delish as expected! cant wait to try something different tom!  this is my new fave place for sure!"}
{"text":"This is about my 4th or 5th time frequenting this joint and although the food is excellent, the wait times are horrific.  Took me 25 minutes to get my takeout order to go.  That is exceptionally way too long for any order.  People and food make up for it, which is why I'm at 4 star instead of 5."}
{"text":"Yummy place! I was in Vegas with a group of friends and their menu had both healthy and \"happy\" options which satisfied everyone on our crowd. The inside has very cute decor and it's definitely worth a try. The prices were average, not too expensive. It's worth the money you pay for it. I recommend very highly the shrimp tacos !"}
{"text":"I have to say I love this place. The food is great and cooked to your specifications. Not so great when it's busy though as finding a place to sit tends to be a little difficult. But no matter what time of day one of the servers, Zia, is always bright and bubbly. She recognizes us each time we come in and greets us with a smile and fresh cut lemons for my tea. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"First, the people who work here are SO NICE! I don't remember walking into any establishment and having the workers be this friendly, accommodating, and chill.   We ordered the Cherry Popper with truffle fries and DAMN! The fried egg just oozes all over your hand, complimented by the Hawaiian bun and slaw. Praise the lord.   Another highlight is the pure came sugar soda! WOW! Free refills on their sodas and iced tea!   Lastly, they have one red bench outside which is perfect for bringing your pups and enjoying this delicious fare.   Definitely will be back to try other items. Curious about the Balls. Lol."}
{"text":"YAAS!! I love options and this place delivered!! Sometimes I healthy other times not so much .... more than anything I like good tasting food and this place had good food on both sides of the menu."}
{"text":"Yumm-my! The one word to describe my experience at SkinnyFats. I've heard about SkinnyFats from friends so my boyfriend and I decided to make a stop here for lunch.   Upon entering we noticed a long line, definitely a good sign. This gave us time to look at the menu, but we quickly knew what we wanted.  I decided on the Chickhumm ($10) - grilled chicken, arugula, tomato, red onions, and hummus on a wheat bun with truffle fries. It's very hard these days to find a delicious and healthy burger, but at SkinnyFats that won't be a problem. The Chickhumm was amazing, drool worthy. It originally comes with sprouts, but I personally don't like sprouts so I substituted it with arugula and it tasted great. The ginormous piece of grilled chicken was cooked nicely and not overcooked/burnt. The housemade hummus went perfectly with all the ingredients, no ketchup was needed!  When did a restaurant ever use hummus on a burger (not in my experience at least)? Kudos to the restaurant! The truffle fries were just as great. The truffle fries didn't come salted, but they do provide you with salt if you'd like them salted. I personally prefer my fries either lightly salted or not salted at all. I had a taste of the sweet potato fries and even though the truffle fries were great, I preferred the sweet potato fries. The best part, the burger and fries did not leave a huge grease stain on the napkins/paper mat. This definitely goes to show how much grease is actually used or the lack of.   SkinnyFats has a wide menu ranging from salads, tacos, burgers, waffles and smoothies.  They also provide delivery to the strip, so if you're with a group of friends and want a nice affordable meal, SkinnyFats is only a call away. Unfortunately if you order at this location, you will probably have to enjoy the meal to-go since there is very limited seating. Even though the line was long, it did move. Considering how many customers they have at a given time, there was some confusion/mix-ups on meal orders of the other customers. It was quickly straightened out though.   Overall I will definitely be coming back and trying the other items on the menu. Next up, the Ahi Tacos!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to visit after a good workout! The name says it all Skinny/Fats. Take you pick skinny or fat....perfect name. From yummy sweet pancakes too great healthy sandwiches and wraps. Love that they have fresh juices and cane sugar sodas. They have certain options that are only available for a limited time and a great selection of regular menu options. Have had chicken twnders, sandwiches, and a salad all have been good, some more than others. I absolutely love the fresh juices all which are delish. The prices are a little high  but the food is fresh and much better option than your yucky fast food so you definiely get what you pay for. Gets super packed during lunch time so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Great food!! But service was not welcoming at this location. Dean Martin location is very nice and calming atmosphere. Here I felt like they were not friendly at all. You have one girl and the rest is all awkward guys working there that we're giving weird looks the whole time. Sorry but when I eat I like to know that I'm not getting looked at every 5mins from them. ESP when we gave a compliment that the Benny special was very good the cook gave a weird look not happy about that. Customer service is everything and they need to work on that over there but food is amazing!!!! now I know to stick to the dean Martin location even if I'm near the warm springs location. 5 stars for food. 1 for customer service."}
{"text":"This place was so great! I came here for lunch during a training and was so impressed. I loved my fresh green juice and my lunch was also fresh and delicious. The customer service was awesome. The girl up front was fun, and nice! I'd definitely recommend stopping in for fresh healthy food!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS really turned my day around wow this is truly an amazing place!!!! I had not so great day today at all and to top it off I scratch my cornea so my day wasn't getting good. So I get home and my son tells me let's go out to eat and I asked him is this place good??? He said yes you won't regret it.... well I told him it better be bcuz I'm not too happy right now... We get there and from the guy at the register \"Jeremy\" so welcoming and friendly and very helpful with the menu!! Helped me order great foods!!! and a very nice food runner \"Sara\" To the most friendliest manager who just with her energy \"Fonzia\" she and this place turned my whole day around wow !!!! THANK YOU..Fonzia, Jeremy the cooks you guys are amazing! SkinnyFATS should be proud to have great employees like you guys! To the Cooks your food is amazing  I will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Very small but clean restaurant. It was about $23 for my gf and I to get two burgers, fries, and drinks. Filet mignon burger was perfect! Great service."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and a great concept. The location is difficult to spot from the road. It is also pretty small inside and people linger, so finding a place to sit can be difficult. I recommend going at an off time because it can also get busy at peak hours."}
{"text":"Great place with good food. The ambient lighting is just a bit on the dark side...I think they're going for an intimate setting, but it's just a bit too dark in the place in the evenings. Other than that, it's a nice place."}
{"text":"This is off the beaten path in a small office park.  Don't let the location throw you off though because it's a great restaurant.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We took a cab there and when we were done the lady at the register called another cab for us.  Because of the location you will not be able to flag down a taxi so be prepared. Check out the menu and photos, there's got to be something your in the mood for.  They also serve breakfast all day.  I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie and it came out freshly baked. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Great food. I have been there more than 5 times and I have never had anything that I didn't love. The space it self is very small and feels cramped. And service is pretty f Good for the most part"}
{"text":"Interesting. From the outside you can't tell it's a restaurant. It's small inside but I loved the options for light dishes and heartier options. I chose the lighter side, Apple bottom toast. It was good but I was still hungry afterwards. The chicken and waffle (chickadofawafflis or something  like that) was huge and it was great."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! The menu is filled with so much to chose from but i went with the \"Happy\" side and picked the Sweet Cheese Us it was a very delicious philly type cheese steak and i got the side of sweet potato fries to go along with it because those fries make the truffle fries look and taste sad! The only down part of this sandwhich was the top cheese sauce was cold and tasted alot like clumpy velveeta cheese but nonetheless still delicious! I would recommend coming here for the atmosphere and the food! (P.S get a fountain drink the cups are so cute!)"}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant. Their fried chicken sandwich was great. One of the best things about this place is that it's unique. I can't ever remember coming across a restaurant with this type of concept, and that;s a good thing. I'll be back to visit this spot again when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place! Will make this one of my top ten favorite places. Location is in a weird industrial area and the space is a bit small. The service and food is in an A++ category! The Benedict burger and the Chix on Broadway sandwich are my personal favorites. The Slaw-Chi is a delicious combination of two things I am fond of. Sometimes the daily specials catch my eye and I swing in after work to try. Slappin Da Bass was one of the daily specials I had to try because it was a very tasty twisted Sloppy Joe. Tried one of the green healthy drinks and did not like that. Friendly service with a smile. I tried the Sweet Cheese Us and the Ahi Taco-San. So delicious and I think that I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Just as great as the other location, except with lots more room. Very spacious inside with giant doors that opens up to a patio. Tried the S'mother load breakfast burrito that should be called the kitchen sink. Everything under the sun was in this massive thing. Had good flavor, but with Cholula hot sauce it was even better. Really like that they offer quite a few healthy options. Service was a bit off with orders getting delivered to the wrong tables, but it seemed that new staff was getting trained. Friendly service with a smile."}
{"text":"They have some unique names that make it fun with some great healthy options as far as calories go. Juices are overpriced and not that great. I didn't have an unpleasant experience but it's way to expensive for what you get. I paid almost 40 dollars for 2 people and just was not up the standard of what I expected."}
{"text":"The same day I posted this review, I was contacted by someone from SkinnyFats.  I have to say that I am so beyond impressed with their customer service. Lana was very apologetic with what had happened and wanted to understand the issue in order to remedy the situation moving forward. I really appreciate the effort the restaurant put forth to redeem themselves. Probably won't take the same group of people back to the restaurant but it won't be off my weekend rotation."}
{"text":"So savory & delicious!! -- STEAKcation -- bomb. Ask for extra horseradish sauce, if your into the spice. Passion iced tea. Unlimited regular and a selection of unique cane sugar sodas. Everything on this menu is so delicious. You honestly can't go wrong with anything you pick!"}
{"text":"The only reason why I gave them 2 stars was for the staff. This place ran out of all juices and they got my order wrong so...."}
{"text":"The employees are very friendly but the menus is a different story no to much option and the vegan option is no the best but still better the other places but no my first choice for sure"}
{"text":"WOW!  Everything about this establishment is just Amazing. The concept, the level of service, the quality of food, the comforting interior... I have never seen so many happy employees before! I also love the new bigger location as it accommodates a higher volume of customers without a crammed pack feel SkinnyFATS knows whats up, they are doing it right!   The Food; Presentation, quality, and creativity 10/10 I have enjoyed several items off both sides of the menu and everything is so superb, the Ahi Tacos, The Chix On Broadway, the Monkey Pancakes, Bomb Diggity Blt, and it seems like every time I come in they have a new limited release special thats always amazing! This Place Rocks, I hope this new Location continues to succeed!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff and great service. The atmosphere is amazing they play good music. What I love most is the have vegan items on the menu I don't have to creat my own meal. The caulifire is the bomb and truffle fires with out parmigiana cheese is my favorite. They have cane soda for the healthier options. This will prob be a weekly spot for me and my daughter."}
{"text":"Wow!  Came in only because of the reviews and even though it's hard to get a seat (very small eating area) we loved it.  Came in with a family of 5 and we returned  a second time because of the food.  It was amazing.  We are very picky eaters and giving a  5 stars review is something I  rarely give.   I will return again and again and again.  Reviews were correct!  Great place to eat for the entire family!!!!!"}
{"text":"This visit was a little more disappointing than the last. For one, I had a message from a manager or employee sent to me from a previous review that they were going to have tofu added back on their menu.... no such luck. So I ordered a a full-animal-based item, some frittata sandwich thing, and wasn't too impressed. I had forgotten how much my tastebuds had also started to become adverse to eggs and bacon. In addition, got a huge order of sweet potato fries. Those were great! But I can't really make a meal on sweet potato fries alone. People say it's vegan and vegetarian friendly here, but I honestly didn't see that many options. And I didn't want to be that annoying customer holding up the line asking questions. My partner really likes this place though, so I may be trying it again on our next trip to LV.  EDIT: Turns out this location was just out of tofu, it's not that they don't serve it. I probably misheard the cashier. The manager messaged me again after this review and let me know the new menu was taking more time than anticipated to come out. She informed me of the dishes that are already available for vegans, though weren't clear on the menus yet. I really appreciate her quick response and upped a star because now I'm super pumped for when I can go back and try their vegan breakfast sandwich, among other tasty-sounding meals already available!"}
{"text":"We love this place!  Unique and wonderful food with even better service.  The only negative is that it's too small.  We love the variety of healthy and indulgent, and always make a point to stop in when we're in town.  Alana is too notch and so very professional.  You must try this place!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with Skinny Fats. I've had just about everything on the menu. They are always packed, but the staff is awesome. Could be a bad thing to my belly and pockets that our offices are right next door. And the fact that that they have increased operating hours. I'm in trouble."}
{"text":"Only been here once and plan on going back again. I had the Sweet Cheese Us sandwich, which was their version of a Philly cheesesteak. Definitely not something I would order again. I love the Te-Nuts, which was a cucumber boat, filled with ahi tuna. There were several things on the menu that interested me and for that I will be back."}
{"text":"Seems like a healthy place to eat but just very crowded and small . Need to expand or find another way of seating people because how it is now is very crowded . But food is great."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! I wish they were bigger so I could sit and enjoy the atmosphere, but I'm never disappointed when I get home and eat! Everything is always so fresh tasting."}
{"text":"This is an interesting restaurant, with a lot of good ideas. It's always very busy, which is a good sign. I enjoy their food, and I would only say that some of it is a little too \"unique\" for my taste, but that's just me. I did like the protein waffle quite a bit, and my family enjoyed their meals as well."}
{"text":"My mom and I tried SkinnyFATS for the first time, and we absolutely loved it. I got the stuff on curry and SkinnyFATS punch. My mom ordered the shrimp tacodilla, turnip taco, and hangover remedy juice. We both enjoyed our food and the atmosphere of the restaurant. It was a very joyful and calming environment with a helpful staff who had great recommendations. We also tried the snickerdoodle cookie for dessert, and it was soft and sweet. I will be back to try more items!"}
{"text":"Excellent choices!! The Skinny side of the menu is full of diverse choices, not just salads. Service was pretty good, only small complaint is my breakfast burrito could of been warmer"}
{"text":"Nice spot with something for everyone. Liked the concept. Dessert and breakfast items are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the way the menu is structured with healthy side and happy side and calorie counts for each category. The avocado toast with sunny side egg on top was sublime."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've gone for breakfast and lunch.  Very healthy and tasty options right off of the Strip.  Staff is incredibly friendly as well.  Word of caution - it's popular causing seating to be at a premium."}
{"text":"Nelson, thank you for finding this great little place.  I had this bookmarked for a few months and today I gave it a go.  It has to be all 5 stars.  The menu at Skinnyfats is divided into Happy Eats and Healthy Eats.  So of course I looked immediately at the happy side, skipping the healthy side, and I ordered their Bonjour Brulée, which the menu describes as \"9 grain bread dipped in our egg white signature crème brulée mixture, pan fried and drizzled with agave nectar.\"  It comes with three slices of applewood smoked bacon.  There was no whipped cream as Nelson had, but it really is not needed.  You order at the counter, sit anywhere, and then one of the nicest young women brings your coffee or other drink and food to your table.  The French toast was wonderful. The agave syrup was only needed a tiny bit, and the fresh berries were the perfect topping.  The coffee was good.  While waiting, I took a bunch of photos and just enjoyed the place.  Whoever came up with the theme and the decorations was very creative and imaginative.  I want to use the word cute, but I don't like using the word cute in general.  This is an out of the way place but I can see where they would do a good business from all the businesses in the area.  I wlll be back.  This is a place to try over.  Lunch next time!  This is a place to bring out of town guests for breakfast.  They'll love it.  Nota bene:  Follow Nelson's directions and look at his photos and you'll get right to Skinnyfats straight away!"}
{"text":"I came here with a party numbering about 15 and we ate on the patio where we could shove the tables together and accommodate the group.    I ordered the filet 'o fire, a spicy sandwich with filet slices with chopped tomatoes and spicy chopped peppers.  This is an off menu item that is displayed on their changing photo screen at the registers.  Ordering was quick and after filling my cup with iced tea, I took my number and went outside to wait for the food.  It wasn't a long wait at all.  My earlier review of this place was after they'd been opened for a short time.  I am happy to upgrade my rating based on the competence of the servers with a group as large as ours.  Their training and experience have paid off!"}
{"text":"Delicious healthy options. We got there just before open and a small crowd had gathered. Food came out in a timely matter and looked presentable! Super tasty. I will visit again!"}
{"text":"will be my go to stop in and out of Vegas,   great quality and variety of food, fantastic service, nice set up,"}
{"text":"Love Love Love!!! I went with a group of four people. The intimate and trendy atmosphere is nice and has the same vibe as Fremont East.   The food is amazing my boyfriend and I shared the Nice To Greek You and the Cherry Popper! It was only $20 and was well worth it! Hands down the best flatbread I've had In a while and the burger was amazing! And to top it off you can get your cookie warmed for desert yum!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout a couple months back and wasn't overly impressed, but most places should not be judged on their takeout. We decided to give it another try last night. So glad we did!   Not only was the food great, but the prices are reasonable and the portions are perfect. My daughter had the pancake from the healthy side of the kids menu. It was delicious! I ordered Smoke in a Bowl, we had the \"Yummus\", and my husband got Two-Nuts. We were all impressed, and left satisfied, not stuffed! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has guaranteed my business for the next forever. They managed to turn what could have been a difficult experience into one that has won me over. We had to wait close to 40 minutes for our food and some items were unavailable but during the time, the gracious staff was kind enough to not only apologize profusely but provide us with more than enough in return for the inconvenience. Everyone was incredible and the food was just as good. Definitely go out of your way to come here."}
{"text":"Had the \"Zucc It\" plater last night! It was absolutely divine and filling. This dish was absolutely flavorful. With the makings of the mushrooms, bell peppers and tomatoes. I definitely can't wait to have this dish again soon."}
{"text":"The steak sandwich was to die for!! Tender and juicy and cooked perfectly. The fried jalapenos were a little too much and greasy. I had a take a few off. The truffle fries were good. I'm sure they would be better fresh instead of delivery. Also tried the chicken soup. It was a Mexican kind of cream chicken and potatoe soup. Pretty good, very hearty and filling. So much peppers and chicken."}
{"text":"The food was good (had the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis) but the place is smaller than I expected.  Be ready to throw some 'bows to get a table if its busy or you can just get your food to go."}
{"text":"I fell for Skinny  Fats the minute I opened the door. What is not to love about this place? They got everything right from the music, the ambience, the vibe, the friendly staff, the cute salt and pepper shaker, the big smiley on the wall and of course the food.  Glad we chose to come here for our date day.   Hubby ordered a caulifire and a slow boat to China. I had Tu-Nuts and a spicy Latina. We were \"supposed\" to share. He did, I didn't.  The caulifire was good, a little vinegary but light. Both the slow boat to China and Tu-Nuts were pretty filling yet refreshingly good. I preferred the Tu-Nuts just because I'm a poke freak. The spicy Latina was muy Caliente! It was cheesy, creamy, spicy yet light. Everything was good.   We walked out of there feeling satisfied. So glad they're in my side of town. We will definitely be back. I already know what I'm ordering next :)  Oh and by the way, they also provide military discount."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. We order it from postmates almost once a week. We have a lot of favorite dishes, including most of the menu, but specifically the Balls 2.O, Blaze of Thunder, Cherry Popper, caulifire and all of the cookies and juices.   The unfortunate thing is, we have noticed a lot of our orders are usually missing an item, typically a juice or cookie. Postmates refuses to take responsibility for this and we are starting to get quite frustrated. Not sure if this is the restaurants fault or the drivers.  We made an order tonight and our \"Hangover Remedy\" juice was missing and the food was pretty mediocre compared to normal. The Blaze of Thunder, which is usually super delicious and juicy, was VERY dry. It also came with a side salad and no dressing. Very meh and so disappointing.   Please do not keep this trend up, because we love you."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite, with an option of healthy (skinny) or sunny (fat). Came here for a casual lunch yet turned into an unexpected pig out.   Located in middle of nowhere on Dean Martin Road. Place is easy to find with their smily face logo on the garage door facing the road. Ambiance is hip and cozy with limited seating.  From taco section, we ordered both taco from fat side: ahi taco-san and picata piñata. Although both were flavorful, I can't handle much spiciness so I personally liked ahi taco-san better.  4/5 for ahi taco and 3/5 for picata piñata.  Opted for hot mess as an appetizer. Basically a fusion nacho that comes with pieces of fried chicken topped with spicy sauce and sour cream. Indeed, it was an hot mess to eat but it was amazing. 4/5.  Two entrees, again from the fat side of menu. Steak eye is their version of chicken fried steak. It was chicken fried steak on a biscuit with creamy mashed potato. 4/5.  Bomb diggity is a BLT sandwich with lots of crispy bacon. Some pieces were over cooked and rather chewy than crispy. Simple and good. 4/5.   All were good but nothing memorable. I don't appreciate how they clearly mark and section off the healthy and fat section because it makes you feel guilty for choosing everything off the fat side especially when you are pigging out like myself...jk  I will be back again!"}
{"text":"I've heard some great things about this place and wanted to give it a try. This is one my new favorite spots to go to now :) and I will gladly come back again."}
{"text":"It's somewhat difficult to find this place so bust out your GPS folks.    Last visit here was another success, love most of the items here.  But we were here this time for a Yelp promo, we had the chicken waffles and one of them salads and a healthy drink, love them all.    Don't look like an idiot k but the water is off to the side so don't go up there asking for water.  You have to go get it yourself.  And another thing, it gets busy in here and there's not a lot of room to sit down at so have someone in your party grab a seat ahead of time."}
{"text":"Wow, now we got a SkinnyFATS closer to where I live!  Think this used to be the same location that Cici's Pizza was at before...oh well!  SkinnyFATS got me on all kinds of indecision, and it totally affects my ODC.  I mean, it's already hard for me to make a decision on where to eat...let alone what to eat!  So needless to say, it took me a while to decide what I wanted to order.  My family...not so much.  After a brief pause, we ordered:  *T.A.T.S. (healthy) - Turkey bacon, avocado, tomato, spinach and spicy mayo on 9 grain bread  *Cinnutella (happy) - Cinnamon sugar French toast, berries, spiced Nutella, orange agave  *The Big (Bad) Parm (happy & on their secret menu) - Garlic brushed toasted hoagie with breaded chicken, fresh mozzarella and marinara  Overall, good food!  The T.A.T.S was tasty...but would have been 100x better with actual bacon!  Forget the healthy!  Go swiney!  Nice, thick 9 grain bread, lots of fresh avocado and veggies.  Kid was OK with the Cinnutella, but it was hard to distinguish where the actual Nutella was.  Was it supposed to be in that spiced Nutella sauce of sorts?  If so it was light on taste.  The orange agave was good but my kid wasn't too interested in it.  Plus the serving was on the small side for being an actual breakfast entrée.  It would have been better with 4 slices instead of just 2.  The Big (Bad) Parm was definitely a BIG sandwich!  Not much in terms of veggies going on here, folks!  Just look at the pic, all I see is red & white!  Carbs, breading, sauce, and more carbs!  But damn did it make me happy!  Crispy garlic bread, fat breaded chicken breast, topped with a load of mozzarella & marinara!  Like an Italian dinner in a bun!  Mangia!  The regular fries and the sweet potato fries at SkinnyFATS were great as well.  Kind of a thinner cut, but fried crisp and easy to eat.  Damn near addictive with their branded ketchups!!  Only issue I have here is that SkinnyFATS isn't exactly skinny on the wallet.  Entrée items are a bit on the high side but thankfully for the most part the food is very good.  But don't get me started on those expensive fresh juices!  Near the cost of some actual food!  Wow!  Service for us was friendly, quick, and pretty knowledgeable on both sides of the menu.  I know I asked a lot of questions!  Perhaps on my next visit I'll try something on the healthy side of the menu!  But....maybe not."}
{"text":"With the stuff we ate...I think I'll call it FattyFATS!  Seriously...I really do appreciate the 'healthy' side of the menu - all with their multigrain protein waffles, egg white omelette with avocado toast - blah, blah, blah...OOPS, looks like the devil took over!  For this day we stayed with the 'happy' side of the menu!  Come on, it was a weekend!  We just got done mall hoppin'!  We were hungry!  So we decided to carpe diem, go for the gusto!  Actually, this technically was a 'snack' for us LOL - we were past the lunch rush, but it was way too early for dinner.  So this kinda like, lunner?  Uh, linner?  Anyway, somewhere in between.  We ended up gettin' down & dirty with:  -Chicka Wafa Dopolis - Fried chicken tenders over a buttermilk waffle w/syrup & powdered sugar  -Red Velvet Waffle w/Applewood Bacon (special) - Red Velvet waffle with berries, cream cheese frosting w/syrup and a side of applewood smoked bacon  Whoa!  Tasty crazy!  Yes, this is what you get with the 'happy' side of the menu!  Balls-to-the-walls calories!  It drives me kinda nuts when they post the calorie count of things now-a-days (thanks California), but thankfully SkinnyFATS only does is for the 'healthy' side of the menu.  My guess...the 'happy' side is drowning in excess!  I really liked their take on chicken & waffles.  The tenders were moist, crunchy, battered just right.  Sticky sweet with syrup poured all on top!  Their waffle was good as well - not dry, airy & light.  Such great textures!  Red Velvet isn't really my thing but the fam enjoyed this dish as well.  They really liked the waffle, it had good Red Velvet taste, was sweet, and the waffle itself lent a nice crunch.  Applewood bacon, how do you screw that up??  My only complaint about SkinnyFATS is that while the place is hip & happenin', it is SMALL.  Did I just go all caps on that?  I can only imagine on a super busy day they are totally packed, with a line going out the door.  Service was great, with our 1st time there our person was knowledgeable in any questions we had.  SkinnyFATS is not really near my part of town where I live, so as much as I would like to go back, it might be a while.  Perhaps I may try their Warm Springs location instead, that one is a bit closer to me.  Overall though, food is great!  I like the theme, devil or angel?  Good or bad?  Naughty or nice?  At SkinnyFATS the choice is yours!  To be noted, I'm often a pretty bad boy...heh heh heh.  #ichoosetobefat"}
{"text":"I love to come here when I'm looking for a quick, good bite. The staff was so welcoming and very attentive. It's a great atmosphere to bring some friends for lunch or even on your own. The menu is very creative, pleasing all, with a happy and healthy side.. And the healthy side is not boring at all.  I always get the More Cow bowl.. It's awesome! It's very flavorful and the steak is cooked perfectly. I would definitely recommend it if you're a first timer!"}
{"text":"I visited this location with my family and OMG this place is Amazing.  We purchased from both sides of the menu . I loved the secret menu the Hot Mess WAS Outstanding.  The Nice to Greek you is delicious.  We all loved the Apollo fries and NO complaints for the crowd pleaser Chickenini !!!  This was the first time the whole family gave a healthy restaurant two thumbs up and begs to come back.  This place is Amazing and so is the staff."}
{"text":"skinnyFATS. i don't know how to describe this eatery except that it is a wondrous, best of both worlds restaurant that executes their dichotomies so perfectly. i mean, the name speaks for itself, but it's a best of both worlds place in other ways too:  - great ambiance for eating IN, but its quick, made-to-order flow makes it a superior option for taking OUT.  - ideal for eating INDOORS, but there's also a beautiful patio if you want to eat OUTDOORS.  then there's the food part.  there are two sections on the menu, a 'HEALTHY' / SKINNY side and an 'EVERYTHING ELSE HAPPY' / FAT side, which contains the more caloric/indulgent entrees. seriously, each item on the menu sounds delicious and aligns so well with its respective section.  okay, and here's the real reason why i love this place:  they have my favorite beer (delirium), which is actually the only beer they have in stock (or from what i saw) AND they serve smoothies (my favorite beverage of choice). there's no way. NO WAY.  having stuffed myself to the brim during my trip in vegas, i opted out of the bottle of delirium and decided to go the healthy route by ordering the popeyes delight smoothie and the TBLT sandwich. the popeyes smoothie, which was blended with spinach, orange, strawberries, apples, FF yogurt and ice, was AMAZING. the turkey bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich was well-made and came toasted on a multi-grain bread slices. also comes with a free side. i cheated and got the truffle fries. it was heavenly.   only if this spot existed in NYC - think people would go nuts."}
{"text":"A little tight seating and for the price, it is self-order from the counter.   Was a little unkempt as there's no dedicated bus staff.  Food is just fine!"}
{"text":"The staff is always soo friendly here! I love how they have their own soda made with cane sugar. Their classic burger is amazing and the buff chix is my favorite! I just wish it was as pricey as it is :("}
{"text":"So delicious and I want to go back.   I have ordered online 2x now and each time it was not in the system when I arrived to pick it up.  They were apologetic amd pour a rush on it and luckily neither time was I in a hurry. Other wise it would be a 5 star!!"}
{"text":"Very dissapointed, tried to call in an order, amd was told you can't do pickup. So I went to the restaurant and even though I saw 5 employees doing sidework and greeting people, there was only 1 person running the register. After waiting about ten minutes without the line moving, I left. This was at the Decatur location, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Ordered a little from the healthy side and a little from the happy side.  Food was amazing. My husband had the ahi tuna tacos and I had the avocado toast.  Worth standing in line.  Check it out next time you're in Vegas.  Not far from the strip."}
{"text":"Walked in at 9:45 am.  Not busy, which was great.  The food was good, but we could not get past the un-bussed and unclean tables. (Notice to management- you had 3 servers/counter staff not seemingly busy)   We ordered the #Merica* - (shaved NY chicken fried steak, 2 biscuits and a side of 3 eggs), the S'motherload (steak, potato's , eggs, peppers, cheddar & pico wrapped in a tortilla with \"Cajun cheese sauce), coffee, and a cold-pressed apple juice.   Husband says the apple juice deserves  5 stars itself! The #Merica was fine. We had to ask for a side of gravy as there was only a scant bit on each biscuit. The gravy had good flavor and the biscuits were good although slightly crispy. Their take on a breakfast burrito was much better. The sausage, sliced thin, was excellent!  I loved the potatoes as well. I have to say it would be better if there was a version without the steak and more potato, egg & sausage, which I'm betting they would do.  At the beverage bar they offered water with cucumber & lemon! Refreshing!   If I could offer 3.5 stars I would based on the juice and pretty good food. We would totally comeback to give them another try - hopefully the tables will be wiped clean by then.  Cleanliness aside, the staff was pleasant and did check on us several times.   P.S. Hallelujah! At 10:30, one of the staff started to clean the tables although it appeared that an owner or manager type had walked in."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is fantastic. The only reason I don't give a 5 is because if it's lunch hour, it's extremely difficult to find a table, after waiting in line for 15-20 mins to order. Then it's another 15-20 mins to get my food. Takes too long and I'm always late. Also, their drinks are pricey. Hoping they expand on their original location."}
{"text":"I order from here more then I'd like to admit. Food and service is always great!  Love coming here!"}
{"text":"We ordered food from both the healthy and unhealthy sides of the menu and unfortunately the healthy dishes did not taste good at all. I ordered their turkey and cranberries sandwich and did not find any trace of cranberry inside. The truffle fries were only mildly truffle-y. Their smotherload burrito was really good though."}
{"text":"Loved everything! Small portions so that you can try more things. Decent price. Good atmosphere. What can you expect more! Hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is a very good place to eat. Their food is delicious, atmosphere is contemporary however the location doesn't seem practical although they do seem to be rather busy. I try to eat there every time I drive by there."}
{"text":"Really good food and wonderful customer service. We ordered the Cluck Moo and Steak Eyes, delicious and fresh tasting. I also also got the Hangover Remedy juice (because Vegas) and it was very tasty and refreshing, just what I needed. I wish this place was a little bigger though, because it was pretty packed and there was nowhere else to sit inside. We had to sit outside at the picnic bench, which was fine. I will never forget the girl at the front register, she was probably one of the nicest people I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS still seems to always amaze me they put so little effort into the food and it comes out fantastic. This is by no means saying anything bad about the restaurant. The food is so delicious and simple but it's all in the spicing and delivery methods that they use to make the guest experience absolutely amazing. Today, I am just killing an hour here so stopped in to relax and rehydrate while getting a wonderful treat while I wait.   The wood paneling is what I believe gives the restaurant so much character and even if it only part paneling and tile. The employees are so friendly and go above and beyond to ensure the guests experience is positive.   This little stop in I ordered the Fried Pickles with Chipotle sauce. They ended up bringing the order to my table too. This was the first time trying this which are way better than I thought they would be. The pickles are breaded just right and the chipotle sauce does come on the side. Thankfully since it is a tad on the spicy side. To wash it down with I am trying their iced Passion Tea. It is very hydrating and has the perfect balance of passion that I am looking for. Have nothing but all raves for this restaurant, it is always an excellent experience with awesome food!"}
{"text":"Always wanting to try this restaurant I am doing that now. The menu here is fantastic and offers so many excellent ways to mix veggies with rice and other staples. This is just a small sampling of what they serve here. When you walk through the doors a huge fan is circling above your head. It looks like a fan and that belongs in a bar somewhere next to the beach. When you proceed to the line there is a giant happy face behind you on the wall. It is a sign for the way the food is going to make you feel. Or I hope so.  The cashier was very friendly and pleasant. He answered questions that I had about the menu and the toppings on their menu items. I am so impressed with the customer service of the staff here too they take friendly to the next level ensuring that the guest experience is excellent. The service here is exceptional too.   The food is absolutely wonderful with the smell as it sits in front of you overwhelming. It stimulates the old factory and starts the motor skills to pick up the fork sensation. Delightful smells fill my head and delight my tongue.   I ordered the breakfast potatoes with only peppers. They were cooked to perfection and smell heavenly. The staff associate that brought my order to the table directed my attention to the various catchups that are only found here. With many varieties I found the Unipeppercorn the best flavor. One can taste just a subtle hint of the black pepper. The cauliflower rice that I ordered was divine too with the best smells coming from cauliflower at that. Being so impressed with this restaurant this will become a regular haunt."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 4 or 5 times and I have enjiyed myself each and every time. The have a fun and fresh menu that both a meat eater and a vegan can be satisfied with. This morning I had the TeriyAHI sandwhich with truffle fries. The tuna was seared nicely in the outside and rare on the inside, just the way I like it. The nine grain bread is sturdy enough to stand up to tuna, veggies, and teriyaki sauce. The truffle fries were hot, crispy, and tasty. My companion had the Chickawaffledoplis. The chicken tenders were nicely breaded and crispy fried. The waffle was fluffy and light. The two together are a great pair. We also got a soda and it is with it to note they don't have the typical sodas on tap. I had a delicious creme soda that greatly enhanced my meal. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went to Skinnyfats with my sister last night. Great service, AMAZING food... And definitely has an Austin, TX vibe which was really appreciated. It's casual yet delicious. I will definitely come back here! Great place!"}
{"text":"I had a really good experience at SkinnyFATS today.   I came with a big group so I apologize to everyone who didn't get to sit because of us.  It's like a not entirely too healthy health cafe.  You basically order at the counter and they give you a number to know where they bring your food.  They have a Healthy side AKA the Skinny and then a Happy side AKA Fats.  Everything is reasonably priced. Considering this is sort of close to the strip, it's geared towards health, and it has unique/quality dishes the prices are awesome.   They have a bunch of salads that are under $7 (without meat) and are big for the price.  Usually places like this try to sell you overpriced salads.  Also it's good for kids! We brought three kids who liked it. They have a kids menu which I believe is $5 a meal. The sweet potato fries and chicken strips is a generous size that most adults would be overly satisfied with.  I had a Cobb salad from the Happy side and an Asian Cucumber boat off of the healthy side with a smart water. The salad was fresh! The cucumber boat had chicken salad in it topped with teriyaki and spicy mayo sauce. Each food item was about $7 and they were both delicious. Getting two things kind of defeated the purpose of eating healthy but i had to since it was my first visit.   The food is good, the staff is nice, it's clean, it's priced well, and it helps put a spin on healthy food while still appealing to foodies without diet restrictions.   I can't wait to go back and try their other offerings."}
{"text":"I love skinny fats. I think they found the perfect balance of quality, creativity, and cost. Throw in a very pleasant staff and you have a solid local spot. This second location is bigger but still keeps the corky design of the original location.  I've been to Skinny Fats a handful of times. They offer healthy stuff like a fresh juice bar while offering a lot of indulgent culinary concoctions. Pick from the Healthy side or the Happy side.  This most recent visit I got a hot tea and the 'Merica. Perfectly named! As soon as the plate got dropped off I shouted, \"MERICA!\" . This dish included: two buttery biscuits topped with quality chicken fried steak, and creamy country gravy. It also came with three eggs any style. I'm still dreaming about their biscuits. They were so good!  The tea was a let down. They offer quality tea but just give you a cup of hot water to bring to your table. Refills on water are free, but hot tea should be served after steeping the tea bag. NOT A DEAL BREAKER! The tea they served was good but I think they should steep the tea for you. Just saying.   I still think they should offer a server service as the customers would be more inclined to tip the staff! Their staff is awesome and already do the work.   I recommend this place to everyone. Some other recommendations would be their chicken and waffles, all of their burgers, all of their flat breads/pizzas, and their two cucumber boats! The slow boat to China and the spicy tuna boat are both super delicious!"}
{"text":"wonderful place, lovely environment, great food! yum two of my favorites are the Kalefornia & the veggie bowl both heathy yummmmmy dishes... Also cannot get enough of the summer Quence juice drink so fabulousThanks skinny fats xoxoxo...."}
{"text":"First time at this place and I love it!!! Great concept. I had one of the skinny tacos and one of the fat tacos, they both were delicious and made to order. Super fresh ingredients. Love the truffle fries. The restaurant and bathrooms are super clean and the staff is very friendly. I will be definitely be back."}
{"text":"The wait to order your food is ludicrous here. They have atleast 6 people working the front and it takes 20 mins to get to the front and order your food. I don't understand. It's absurd."}
{"text":"OMG! YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY THE AVOCADO TOAST!!! I have never tasted such a great combo of whole wheat toast with avocade, feta, pepper and fried egg! The service was charming. The bathrooms are comical and the place was rock'in. I will become a regular to try other things. Try this place and you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast/brunch cafe with an interesting concept.  The whole idea of this place is that often groups are split with regards to what they would want to eat and/or drink for breakfast or brunch between health nuts who need their daily dose of kale and chia seeds smoothie and \"let's just enjoy life\" bros who want a triple steak with bacon and eggs to start their day well.   This place offers both. And both are great. On my side, the steak with eggs was a bit overlaoded with proteins but was despite it all very delicious. On my friend's side, the detox and post-hangover smoothies were amazing as well."}
{"text":"Lots of good options for everybody. I could come here, be happy with the salad selection (beets and goat cheese for $5.50 is pretty good), get chix tenders for the kids and some of the raw juices (expensive at $9+), and my husband can come get a cheeseburger or cheesesteak.  The inside is cute and kinda hippy, and I think it's locally owned.  Service is friendly, too!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! The only downside is how small the place is. You're arm to arm with the other table"}
{"text":"Staff was really friendly and the food was really good.   We tried the Steak Eyes which is like biscuits and gravy but better with steak. The meat was so tender we could cut it with a fork.   We also had the Cinnutella which was cinnamon sugar French toast with spiced Nutella, berries and orange agave. It was was like dessert for breakfast.   Will definitely return next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Oh my! I'm the fullest person! Everything we had was delicious! Great portions for great prices! It's a unique and fun experience. They go the extra mile with their food. Everything was exceptionally prepared and in a timely manner.  The atmosphere is half between a sit down restaurant and a fast food. You start by checking the menu and ordering at the register then finding yourself a table where you place your order number for your food to be delivered. They check on you the whole time to see if you need anything as well as being you to-go boxes.  There menu is split between healthy food and happy food. But if it didn't say that most of the things on the healthy side you would know were the \"healthy choice\".  The juices were delicious as well as the ketchup choices.  I suggest checking their Yelp menu for secret menu choices before ordering.  I fully believe anything you order will be a great choice!  Myself and my hubby find this \"secret menu\" kinda ridiculous, they should just have these things on their menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I had the ReDiculous waffle and it was great. It was pretty quiet when we got there but as lunchtime came the place started to get packed. Great breakfast for under $15!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! The ordering online was simple and a huge help to speed up the process. Right when I walked in I was greeted and told my order would be ready within the next few minutes. As I grab a cup of the complimentary cucumber water my order was bagged up and ready to go. I was in n out in less than 3 minutes. THIS IS A PLACE IS A MUST WHEN IN VEGAS!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  I can't wait to go back.   The two sides of the menu are a great strategy and a way to keep customers coming back.  It wasn't easy to choose, but I went with a the egg white french toast.  It was perfect -- chewy, dense, toasty and not overly sweet.  The berries on top were juicy and sweet.  The french toast didn't really need syrup -- maple or agave!  My boyfriend ordered the More Cow Bowl and he loved it.  He's picky about how meat is cooked, and he said that the beef was perfectly done and not overcooked. The presentation was unique and the veggies and rice were flavorful.  Like the other reviewers, I recommend getting there early and being prepared to wait if you are arriving at prime time, especially lunch.  The staff knows the menu well and is good at answering questions."}
{"text":"I was looking so much to try Skinny fats and I was ever more excited when I walk in by the simple decor. The service was great and good recommendation at the cash register. Unfortunately, the food was not at the level of the service and very disappointing. I got the zucchini and they were uncook and floating in the tomato sauce. My guest had the burger who was very blend, the truffle fries were really bad. I am not again frozen French fries since generally they are better than real potatoes but at least pick up some good one please. Lot of the food coming out was fried and look not clean and unhealthy. Overhaul , I did not get the entire concept and maybe I miss lead myself with the name of the restaurant."}
{"text":"They have a really good concept but in the end, it was disappointing. You drive into a non-descript business center; which was good because there's plenty of free parking.  You walk into the door and it's a long line.  I don't mind waiting because it gives you a chance to figure out what you want to order.  Everything looks great.  But the place is small so they can't accommodate everyone with a table.  Once a table opened up, we sat down and waited for our food.  I had ordered the Steak Eyes but had to send it back 'cause it was undercooked. Luckily my husband ordered extra food because the Steak Eyes took so long to get back out that we decided to get a refund for it.  And the food we did have was just okay."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite place in Vegas. I've heard a lot of amazing things about it so naturally my hopes were set really high, yet they still managed to shatter. This place exceeded my expectations. If I could give a review higher than six stars, I would. I got the cinnutella French toast and it was cooked perfectly- there was cinnamon sugar baked onto the crust, the Nutella chile sauce was perfect, it was topped with fresh fruit and it was just so amazing. I want to try everything on their menu. My friends and I weren't even talking except to compliment the food and trade bites because it was so good and needed to be savored. The ambiance of the place is also amazing. The walls are wooden and painted with bright colors. There's a sports game being projected onto a wall. There are cute signs hung up and it's really just a great place. I plan to recommend this to everybody."}
{"text":"Went here for a date and it was perfect! For two people who like to try new food and we still try to stay healthy; this was perfect! Tasteful and I didn't feel guilty after stuffing my face! The way they serve the salmon in the cucumber boats is just flawless. And the waiter with the English accent was fantastic!   The only thing I would say would be to make if a little bigger! Didn't have too much room to spare."}
{"text":"Disappointed to do it, but I am docking Skinnyfats one star. This is based both on dining in once, and on the fact that they have increased prices on many of their items.   I went in to try Skinnyfats in person last week with a coworker. It is a small room, with crowded seating. There was a line almost out the door, and there seemed to be a lack of organization with regard to people ordering food versus people picking up to go orders.   After ordering and taking a seat at a table, we had what seemed like an excessive wait for our food, all of which came out at different times. I always hate eating while the person that is with me is still waiting for their meal... I also hate when my food is cold because I waited for my fellow diner to get their meal.   All of this aside, the food was good. I once again had the skinny bowl, which was less runny this time around. I also had a Little Gobbler which was excellent. On the way out, I made sure to grab a menu.  Fast forward 1 week. We were all set to place a delivery order with Skinnyfats when I noticed that many of the items we wanted were listed at higher prices than the paper menu we had picked up just one week prior. Examples:  Mr.Green cold pressed juice was $7.50 last week. It is now $9.50. (All juices went up $2) Skinny Bowl was $8.75 last week. It is now $9.75. Flat Chix & Greens was $8 last week. It is now $9.50.  What I noticed, and was frustrated about regarding these prices increases, is that there are some items on the menu that have notes indicating that ingredients have been added to the dish, however these are NOT the items with higher prices. For example, the Drunken Gypsy Toast is the same price it was before, however it now comes with berries and bananas on top. The wrap my co-worker had a week ago is the same price, but it now has rice added to it.   I'd understand raising the prices on items because the ingredients changed, but that does not appear to be what is happening here. It also does not appear that all menu items containing specific ingredients were raised in price, which, again, would be understandable. Instead it appears Skinnyfats just raised the prices on items at random.   Maybe I am being nitpicky, maybe it's harsh to dock a business a star over a few bucks... But I can not honestly say I am a big fan of Skinnyfats after 2 less-then-amazing experiences and these seemingly random price hikes. A-OK is a more accurate description of how I feel about this business."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for SkinnyFATS to finally open here.  They officially opened yesterday.  Most importantly, I no longer have to drive 30+ minutes to get my SF fix.  Just in case you haven't been to SF, I'll educate you a little.  This is the 3rd location in the Las Vegas.  The menu is separated by a Healthy side (the skinny) and a Happy side (not so healthy). Thus the name, SkinnyFATS.    I've been a fan of SkinnyFATS since day one.  And over the years, I found what I really like here.  I usually order their Wrap Supastar (Chicken & Egg White Wrap).  It's my favorite simply because there's so much protein in it. It taste good too. On this visit, I decided to get something off the happy side of the menu.  I got their Meltdown, which is basically a double meat patty melt.  My patty melt was very good and it came with a side of soup. The overall menu consist of Shareables (the apps), Between the Buns (Sandwiches & Burgers), Tacos, Things in Bowls (exactly how it sounds), and Breakfast (I shouldn't have to explain what that is).  Besides the drinks, the prices are very good and the portions are big.  The line was little slow, but it wasn't due to the staff.  The staff was efficient. There is a lot on their menu and the customers in front of us were just a little undecided.    Just a note...currently, this location has items that cannot be found at the other locations.    Just another note...off the menu items can be found on their TV screens by the register.   Just a final note...I love SkinnyFats' initials SF.     2017 Yelp Review #28"}
{"text":"I tell you...I need to do a better job in 2014 taking care of some of my bookmarks.  I've had SkinnyFats bookmarked ever since I read Amanda M and Nelson Q's review back in July. The gf even told me about this place and wanted to go.  She made it, I didn't.  But now I'm here.   So if you read the other reviews, then you get the gist of what SkinnyFats is all about.  They have a \"Healthy\" side and a \"Happy\" side.  Obviously, the \"Happy\" side is your higher calorie options while the \"Healthy\" side is for those trying to clean it up.  There's a selection here for everyone, which makes this place a must try at least once.  But a place like SkinnyFats may not be for everyone.   First of all, the Healthy side isn't super clean.  It's just clean for eating out.  As for their \"Happy\" side, it's higher calorie but not crazy high.    As a first-timer, I decided on getting something on the \"Healthy\" side. What I get? I got their Healthy Juan Wrap, which consisted of egg whites, chicken breast, black beans, turkey sausage/bacon, brown rice, cilantro yogurt, cheese and pico all wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla.  When I ordered this bad boy, I was told that the Juan had 3 egg whites and 6 oz. of chicken.  My goodness, this has to be 50+ grams of protein.  Sweet..this takes care of two meals for me.  I loved my order.  I know it's a wrap, but to me this tasted like a healthier version of huge breakfast burrito.  I killed it and left SkinnyFats satisfied.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=GolhEXzqrzu1AthjhU7RFQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ  Now for the ambiance.  SkinnyFats is one popular and tiny restaurant.  I say popular because the lines made it outside.  This place gets crazy and loud.  And because it gets so busy around noon, our orders took some time.  So take my advice, SkinnyFats is a place to try, but not around lunch time.     PS:  I'm sure that I will be back.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gqksGYp585yrpB2re-gq0w&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ"}
{"text":"I never had anything here that was less than stellar! It's one of the few places where I don't mind trying something new and I'm blown away with incredible flavor!   You can't go wrong here! Your taste buds will be bursting with flavor and happiness even after you've left."}
{"text":"After my experience, the manager took the time to listen to me, addressing the issue in a very professional manner.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I loooooove skinnyfats but it's way too expensive for being a self serve place. My husband and I got the veg-to-bowl and the veg-which and two juices and it was almost $50. That's about what we'd pay for a nice sit down place. Also the tables are almost always dirty and you're lucky if you even get one. I am a vegetarian and one time I ordered a vegetarian meal (duh) and not only were there little pieces of bacon, but also steak. I was disgusted but politely let them know so maybe they would start cleaning their grill better between meals.  BUT on a positive note; it is less crowded now that they have a new location, and the staff is always friendly and happy. I'll keep coming here for the food. It's just too good! I just wish it was a tad bit less expensive."}
{"text":"I love this place! Eat here whenever I can.  The decor & vibe is cool.  I love how their menu gives you the best of both worlds, as far as food goes. Everything on the menu is really tasty. Must go!"}
{"text":"Didn't visit the shop as our lunch was catered. But I can say they make great burgers!"}
{"text":"Everyone was ranting and raving about this place so I was super excited to try it! I ordered a waffle off the skinny menu and my boyfriend ordered the chicken sandwich off the fat menu. The chicken sandwich was just okay and the waffle was pretty good, but overall as a meal I wouldn't go back. The cranberry patties are probably the worst thing I've ever had and had to spit them out. I might go back and try something else, but I'm in no rush."}
{"text":"There's a million places to eat in this town and I'm nit sure why I just wanted in line for 20 minutes to order a $11 scrambowl that doesn't even come with toast or rice .  $2.75 for a soda ???    And WILL needs to be taught how to wipe a table down.  It's flu Season and a half ass wipe down (after I had to ask for one ). Doesn't cut it.    WHATS THE HYPE.  I don't get it.      Food was just ok.  Not over the top and not worth a 20 minute wait and begging for a table to open"}
{"text":"The outside looks big but inside it's much smaller. There are about four tables for 4 people, three tables for 2 people and quite a few breakfast bar seats. You come in and there are some menus on the wall. You browse the menu while you're in line to order, order and pay, then find a seat. If you're with a group, have someone scope for seats and save it while the other order. I definitely would not recommend going during the brunch rush because by the time we left the line went outside. We came at 11 and it was busy but not packed. We were able to score a table for four after we all ordered.   I shared the steak eyes with a friend. It's a play on a steak eggs benedict. The steak is a 'country fried steak' though the batter slipped off right away.  I didn't mind because I don't think I would've liked it on my steak. The biscuits though were delicious! I really liked the dish and my one stack was filling. If I ate the whole thing by myself I'd really hate myself. I would suggest sharing this with a friend and maybe getting an appetizer.   All in all, great food but slightly uncomfortable location due to size."}
{"text":"I don't always have to feel like a fat ass!   Odd location but i guess it works for the surrounding businesses which was why i found myself walking around looking for food, waiting on my car to be worked on. SkinnyFATS delivers on a number of levels, but really for myself in a way that i can eat a meal and not totally feel like garbage the rest of the day. Light, healthy meals made with fresh ingredients makes me happy... like the Mango Chicken bowl with brown rice adding some avocado and viola you have a solid lunch. This location seems a tad bit smaller than the other on Durango, but it does make up for having outlets at the bar seating area to plug in a laptop to work on the go as Durango does not have that. All in all a good spot to stop in for a meal if you want to get way from fast food, or you can also indulge in the \"naughty\" side of the menu if you feel the need put on a pound or two."}
{"text":"Interesting concept... and i so badly want to order off what i call the $hitty side of the menu but i dont want to feel like a piggy when im done eating.   Good decor when you walk in and the food is always quite fresh. Ive had quite a bit from the brown rice chicken bowl, turkey burger, and the Greek thingie which were all very good. The service is always with a smile and the knowledge of the menu is super helpful for me as i allow the employees sometimes to just order for me so thanks! Id say the only negative here is the parking situation... a little tight but cannot be helped given the location.   Ill soon eat something from the naughty side... but ill be sure to run 5 miles the follow day to justify it."}
{"text":"The Tru Bleu was delish.  But i sent my order in online knowing that they were probably busy but it took them about 20 minutes after i got there to get my order ready.  Highly disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"Super packed lunch place! Came here on a Saturday lunch time and there were no seats. :(.  However, this place has a wide range of healthy dishes and some less than healthy dishes. We opted for the chicks on broadway with truffle fries. The chicken sandwich was moist, huge and delicious. For $10, it was enough to feed my gf and I. Also, they are the only place that I know of that offers nice water cups.  Overall, an amazing deal off the strip. I definitely see myself coming here again on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"This place was the perfect breakfast spot for me! I travel a ton for work, and in a place like Las Vegas, it's great to find a welcoming breakfast spot off the strip. I had the Wrap Supastar, which I just couldn't fathom was only 360 calories! It was so good, so filling (couldn't finish it!) And packed with protein.  The staff was chill, the whole place was laid back, and the cream soda was some of the best I've had. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.   Ditch the buffets and head to SkinnyFATS!"}
{"text":"\"If I had my life to live again, I'd find (SkinnyFATS) sooner.\"  Had I found it earlier, I would have visited this restaurant every day while in Vegas. Disappointed that we only went 1X for breakfast.  ChickaWaffadopolis- consists of fried chicken tenders, buttermilk waffle, syrup, and powdered sugar. Ordered by two of my sons who raved about it.  Wake N' Bacon - bacon, egg and cheese (pepper jack) on a roll (Hawaiian) with avocado and sriracha.  Breakfast sandwich on steroids. Excellent.  Steak Eyes 2.0 - country fried filet medallions, jalapeño cornbread and gravy plus 2 eggs. My new \"last meal on earth\" selection. No joke.  Yelp was made to find places like this. If you're reading this - GO AND THANK ME LATER."}
{"text":"Staff wasn't helpful and served us stale cookies. Ordered 2 same shakes, they didn't taste alike. Boo. Over hyped"}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review since someone reached out to me and personally helped and took care of the situation. I appreciate that kind of service. I returned and everything tasted great as it has has been in the past! Filet o fire is something you cant go wrong with. Thank you."}
{"text":"The restaurant was quite small without alot of seating, but the food was very good. I arrived around 2 p.m. and had a group of 5. We were not able to find seating for our group so we ordered to go.  I had the Blaze of thunder, and personally feel like it was too hot and not enough bang for your buck. Sweet potato fries were nice and crunchy. A great compliment to the burger. It looks like they are expanding the restaurant to accomodate their future patrons."}
{"text":"Finally! It's about time the Northside gets some cool restaurants. That means less gas and time wasted traveling across town for this gem of a restaurant.   Unlike the Dean Martin location, this place is much more spacious and have plenty of seating (yes, no more table hogging like savages). Of course, their interior is definitely up to par with their other locations; super hippie and great for pictures! haha. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgable of the menu so no worries if you have any questions.  Just like their other locations, they provide, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free options; so this is great for a group of people with different lifestyles.  So here's what my friend and I got: --Salmon Overboard: A cucumber boat with a generous slab of buttery salmon topped with a creamy spicy slaw. Great appetizer or mini entree if you're not too hungry. It comes with 4 pieces and is listed under 'Shareables' in the menu, but honestly I ate it all to myself. lmao.  --Naked Chix: Chicken topped with a mango basil sauce placed on top of cauliflower rice. I've never tried cauliflower rice before but I am quite impressed! Although it tastes nothing like normal rice, it still is a great alternative for those eating low carb.  Altogether, a great first impression of this place! They're about to open an extension called Coldpress Express so I'm definitely looking forward to that!"}
{"text":"Great menu variety, I loved the outdoor eating area. The food was delicious and everyone who worked there was super friendly."}
{"text":"Love the food here, great service and ambiance as well. Love the option to have healthier options. Small location w/ nice decor. Service staff has always been friendly every time I have visited."}
{"text":"Oh god this place is amazing. Every time I go in, I say 'Yeah, I'll stick to the Healthy side of the menu...' and I'm tempted over to the 'Happy' side. Unhhh so good."}
{"text":"Where is the button for 100 stars? Seriously so good. I've been here 3 times, 3 days in a row and I can't get enough. It's always busy which is kind of a downer however it is so worth the wait!!! The ahi sirachi tacos are absolutely to die for along with every thing else I've tried. If you care at all about your stomach and your taste buds you will do yourself the favor and get some skinnyfats!"}
{"text":"Food was good and service is always great. Had an allergic reaction to one of the dishes but the supervisor on duty was quick to tend to me and handle the situation. Will continue to indulge in their fine and creative cuisines."}
{"text":"First of all, the food is fantastic.  The problem is getting to it at this location as it's always super busy!   If you're not taking out, be prepared to be frustrated with seating.  I don't know how many times I have wanted Skinny Fats to eat but just couldn't deal with the crowds.  Having said that, I guess that's good for the business owners for sure - bad for customers who like to get out of the office for a bit to eat.   I recommend the Cinnutella for breakfast.  It's goodness to the core.  It may be leaning away from the skinny side a bit but worth it.    I'd give five stars for the food but only three for this particular location due to the poor accommodations for sit down."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed. We ordered a waffle plate and it came out cold. Then our other order never came out so I told the cashier and no apology whatsoever. Got sick of waiting and just left. And no it wasn't busy at all.  Food sucked and service sucked."}
{"text":"A hidden gem that escaped me until now. After reading the reviews of the main restaurant, I decided to give this one a try. It's the closest brunch place around where I live and I pass by it every day without really realizing that it's there. It more than met my expectations and I was absolutely impressed.  The decor of the place is superb. The inside is pleasantly quirky and the outdoor seating area very comfy. The menu was very interesting, with one side called the \"healthy\" side with calorie counts, and the other side the \"happy\" side without the calorie count. Naturally I went for the happy side. I got the S'motherload and the Skinnyfats punch, but I almost ordered the steak eyes too after seeing my neighbor getting it. The Smotherload was kind of like a wet steak and eggs burrito with spicy melted cheese poured over it,  and it was absolutely fantastic. The meat was very tender, and the rest of it was very tasty. I asked the waitress what they put in the cheese and she told me it was a secret ingredient and they cannot give it out, I liked that answer because it made me crave it more  All the items in the menu had very unique names and very thoughtful combinations. It showed how much effort they put in to invent these dishes. The Skinnyfats punch was a perfect combination of all the fruits that I love, combined in somehow the perfect ratios, in seriously the best fruit punch I've ever had. It was really one of the best brunches I've had and they can count on me coming back to try practically everything on the menu"}
{"text":"I love this place! Very good choice of menu and their shakes are sooooo good! The delightful cucumber is my fav. The atmosphere is very calming and hip. Place is hippsterish. Seating is very limited but worth the wait. They have vegan options and they are very tasty. This place is a must go!"}
{"text":"I started my morning like this! haha coffee and chicken sandwich!  It was so huge and very tasty!!! Luckily there was a seat for us. It's always busy!"}
{"text":"Good place for both healthy granolas and \"stuff-your-face, I don't care about calories\" people like us. Different sections of the menu to cater to both.  We are the stuff your face with goodness people.  -long line for this place totally off the strip in a small business park -small place and not good for groups more than 4 (but constant turnover of people) -so many positive reviews for this out in the boonies place so we went to see what the fuss was about and it lived up to the hype.  -great place to have a bite on your way out of Vegas with a full and happy belly before the long drive home"}
{"text":"The TuNuts. Sweet baby jebus, the TuNuts. What is that, you ask? Oh just spicy ahi & sriracha slaw in a cucumber boat w/almonds, teriyaki, avocado & sriracha aioli. JUST the best thing I've ever put in my mouth.  I really wish this place existed in Los Angeles, because I'd be there all the time. The menu has so much variety (for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike), the atmosphere is cool, they make sure your drinks are always refilled and man, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give 5 stars but the seating in this place is so limited! Their food is amazing as well as the staff. A bit high priced but stayed in budget (barely!)"}
{"text":"This place has a lot of variety and the staff is very patient and helpful being it was our first time there.  He went through the menu and gave us suggestions.  The burgers here are so juicy and thick.  The fries are the best.  It's not the easiest place to find as it is tucked away in an unassuming business park.  Prices were average.  I only give it a 4 star compared to many other 5 star ratings because if it's 5 star, i feel like it's a place i would go out of my way to and I don't think i can say that at about this place.  It's good but it's wasn't craving to come back good.  Hope that makes sense  :-)"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Hard to find location, thanks to the giant billboard found it. Restaurant very small for amount of people they serve.  Great cookies and I am a very skeptical cookie monster.  But all in all a great but different dining experience."}
{"text":"Very cramped compared to their other location.  Dark.  Maybe seats like 30 people max.  Very noisy due to the low ceiling.  Just felt a little claustrophobic.  Not a self-serve soda machine.  Not entirely sure but menu also seems smaller.  The line was basically out the door the whole time I was there.  They need like 3-4x more space in there.  The burger I had was good.  But the truffle fries... ICK... I don't know what was wrong with it, old truffle oil, too much, or put on hot fries.  The truffle oil just stuck to my tongue and made everything else kinda yucky.  I usually like truffle fries, but in the instance it was just gross."}
{"text":"Sweet spot. I order the Seared Ahi Tuna sandwich. Its too purfection, not just the fresh tuna. But the bread, lettuce, tomato and my side of fruit. It all fresh and carefully crafted to your order. It shows and you can taste it! Best lunch in Las Vegas for sure. Price, selection and quality of your meal is worth every penny. 5 Stars Team!"}
{"text":"Want to indulge one last time before you head out of Vegas, then SkinnyFats is the place. Menu offers wide variety of options to indulge or if you are watching your waistline.  Location of the strip makes it's great because v you don't have to worry about parking."}
{"text":"This place has some great food which I would give it 4 stars but, it gets 3 because of the restaurant lay out and the fact every time I go in the afternoon there is no seating. I have eaten here multiple times but there food to go is always cold so I prefer to eat in the restaurant. That doesn't always work so well when there are never any tables. Figure out a better layout more conducive to seating. Take out a wall of the Coldpress you don't even use and place more tables."}
{"text":"Back in December of 2013, SkinnyFats impressed the heck out of me at a certain Yelp Event with their juices and their Naked Chix. I figured I would eventually try their shop, and it's a little surprising that it took months.  Actually, make that months and a few extra minutes. I wasn't expecting SkinnyFats to be in a commercial area, but something looking more like a strip mall, so I drove right past them. Whoops! I stopped and reconfirmed the address, went back the other way, and luckily turned into the correct parking lot. So yeah,  they're basically inside an office building, and they have this vertical banner on a pole outside that's either green or pink depending on which direction you're approaching from.  Inside, it definitely looked like a place to eat, with some bar style seating (including power and USB charging outlets) and some tables, all done in dark wood or a wood finish. There's to-go menus near the door (useful for when there's a line), and the closest area on the counter has a citrus water dispenser for those of us who don't want to break the bank on the cold pressed juices. The menu boards are visible after you round the corner, and they're bright and clear to read.  I asked Jenn P for her recommendation and followed it exactly: Chix on Broadway ($9.50), and truffle fries as the choice for the side. It was a real treat. Brioche bun was solid, and all the fresh stuff makes it seem vaguely healthy even for something from the \"happy side\" of the menu, but the star of the show was the chicken breast. It's bread and fried to a great golden brown, crunchy exterior that holds up to the juicy and flavorful interior. It helps that there's portions of the chicken that stick out from the bread since you can go back to those and get enough crunch for the entire sandwich.  The truffle fries were pretty good, and I liked the ketchup with jalapeno for a bit of a kick (they're not that spicy, trust me), but I wouldn't say either of those are anything to write home about.  However, I found something else to like in a bite of another friend's Mr. Flapjack ($8.50). It's actually from the healthy side but tastes pretty sweet. The protein pancakes and banana chunks are probably both supplemented with agave nectar so that it's sweet but not actually all that awful. I didn't get a piece of the turkey bacon, but I would consider ordering this in the future for the pancakes and banana alone.  Not everything might be as good as what I ate today, but I was very impressed. I could definitely see myself coming back as long as I don't get lost."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great food!! My hubby and I were a little bit skeptical since this place is in a weird location and doesn't look like much, but the food is worth it!! Sooo good. The sweet potato fries are unlike any I have ever had,  very sweet and crispy.  I also got the cranberry turkey burger and it was delish. Probably the best turkey burger I have had in my lifetime.  I now understand why people rave about this place!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about our visit, four of us went there for the very first time, the place was packed. When we got our food everything was fine until my wife bit into and pulled out a long Hair (disgusting right) and she told our waiter, he came back and offered to remake or refund my wife's dinner, after such an incident it hard to continue eating so she asked for the refund, while the rest of us finish our delicious dinner. In the mean time the waiter asked for the card so he could refund the amount back. A short time later the Manager or Owner came by and said he was sorry and we said \"we understood that things like this happen\" instead of just refunding my wife's dinner back he refunded all of our dinners back. We left the waiter a big fat tip since it clearly wasn't his hair and he was good at his job.  Customers service A+ Food A Knocked off a star because of the hair, but we would return and recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing food. No diner crap here but unique gourmet like stuff wish we had this in California"}
{"text":"I just don't think the food is that good. It's pretty food but doesn't taste good. Nice looking spot and it feels like you're healthy and in the right frame of mind but nothing comes out or at least nothing I've had that made me want to come back"}
{"text":"Maybe try answering your phones. We waited on hold for 10 minutes to place an order for pickup, then someone answered and put us on hold again for about 5 minutes. Then when we got our order taken, they told us it would be ready in 15 minutes. If our order only takes 15 minutes, then the kitchen isn't really backed up. So why were we on hold for as long as it would take for our food to be ready? Spend the money on an additional order taker during the lunch hours. I'd say it wasn't even really peak lunch rush when we called. We called at 2:15pm. 15 minutes on hold to place a to-go order is absolutely absurd. And when we got there, the place wasn't busy. In the end the food was pretty good, but come on with the service. Get it together SkinnyFats. Not the Worst of Las Vegas for sure, but definitely not the \"Best\"."}
{"text":"FOOD The menu is a combo of both healthy and... We'll fatty food. Everything you eat here is amazing, right down to the cookies. My favorite has to be the pure sugar cane sodas.   SERVICE The staff are pretty friendly, talkative, and do a good job at trying to get you try new things without being too pushy.  DECOR / ATMOSPHERE The walls look like salvaged wood was tiled on the wall. The place is a little small so you don't always get a table."}
{"text":"Cool, delicious, healthy and creative food and drinks!! Very friendly service and reasonable prices. They just opened about 1 yr ago, and they will be opening another location soon around warm springs/Durango."}
{"text":"Incredible atmosphere, clean dining, and a menu for any craving! Skinny Fats is always my go to for meeting up with friends or grabbing a meal to go."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I was referred by a friend. I decided to order dinner to go for the family. We all loved the favor and portion. I actually went back the next day and ordered more food.  The customer service was very friendly. Definite will be back"}
{"text":"\"The Meltdown\" - freaking delicious. Loved the atmosphere and setting. Would go back for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Local spot. The owner is slowly making their way around the city following the 215. As soon as you walk in everyone starts welcoming you. Customer service is on POINT. The employees know about the menu. Buff Chicks are awesome the portion is a pretty good size. Truffle fries are top notch. The Blaze sandwich is killer I have to get the sauce on the side because that stuff is fire in my mouth. I've only had a couple of the breakfast items. Nothing bad to say about this place. All the food from location to location is the same. There's no chef putting his twist on something that doesn't need a twist. Everything is perfect."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here on a Saturday afternoon and the line was out the door! Not being phased, we ended up waiting, and we were pleasantly surprised that the line went by efficiently and fast! While we were waiting though, we were able to have a cup of lemon water and have a copy of their menus to look at so we know what to order when we get to the cashier.   My mom and I decided to share 2 waffles, the Waffle-Dopolis (something around these lines) and the REDiculous.  The Waffle-Dopolis was basically a pizza waffle. It was a plain waffle with mozzarella cheese, meat (I think ham), and tomatoes. The waffle was so soft, but not chewy! It really felt like I was eating a pizza. All the flavors blended really well together and I had no complaints.  The REDiculous was just as good. It was a red velvet waffle with cream cheese whipped cream, chocolate chips, blueberries, and raspberries with bacon on the side. The waffle as well was very soft and flavorful, and the fruits were sweet! My mom and I are not fans of strong cream cheese flavors, and were grateful that the cream cheese wasn't overly done and given in the right amounts. It wasn't too sweet and added the right amount of taste a red velvet anything would need.  Overall, along with our strawberry lemonade drink, we paid around $25. I have no complaints whatsoever about this place. Maybe they need more chairs, because every time I hear about this place, I always hear about how packed it is!  I will return again for sure. This is one of the best hidden gems Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, everything I have eaten has been flavorful. It is a unique experience and I'll definitely keep coming back. Top: if you order a big-mosa, it comes in a pitcher, easy to share with one other person. Only wish they had more seating. The big table is cool, but it's not practical. It should be removed so more tables can be used in place. The outdoor area is nice."}
{"text":"Without going into too much detail, Dylan HANDS DOWN did the coolest thing he could have done for my family and me. This chain has hired a true customer-centric leader in this young man. After a bad visit about seven months ago, we decided to give it another shot and we were BLOWN AWAY by his service. To top it off, the food was amazing. All four of the people in my party had different tastes in food, and not only did we all find something we enjoyed, we all enjoyed EVERYTHING that was on the table. Most notable was the Tu-nuts on the \"healthy\" side of the menu. Didn't taste like a \"health\" food at all; it had a full favor profile and we weren't left feeling dissatisfied. Their take on a patty melt tasted more like a \"party melt\". Awesome restaurant. We will visit every time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is small inside the crowd here seems like a younger crowd my hubby says a richey, rich type college kid crowd. Despite our judgements we loved this place. I got the Bleu balsamic, truffle fries and the punch. My hubby got the mega health club, truffle fries and the punch.  The punch was amazing. Everything was very tasty and we will be back."}
{"text":"Great food- it was a busy and they could probably use a slightly larger location with more seating but I loved the names of the food and everything was tasty! The turkey cranberry burger was a great choice!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place from family and friends and decided to try it out. Decided to get the Chix on Broadway sandwich that looked amazing. Great portion size for the price and the staff was very helpful and friendly. The reason I'm giving this place 3 stars for now is even though the sandwich looked amazing and the chicken was cooked to perfection, the sandwich was also bland. No seasoning and other than the onions I couldn't taste much else. I'm definitely planning to go back and try some of the breakfast items and probably change my rating but for now it's 3 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to Skinny Fats a few times over the past couple of years .. I once loved it. Nowadays when I go.. The food is still quite edible, but pretty \"meh\" in presentation.   On a recent visit I ordered the \"cherry popper\" burger. It's a burger topped with a fried egg and banana peppers. It was just around medium rare when it came out - which is fine I suppose, but the burger itself was destroyed. My dining companions both mentioned how smashed the burger looked, as the bun - for some reason - had been compressed and the egg was broken. It's sort of the point, but having had the burger before.. I was just disappointed in the presentation as it didn't look appealing.   I am writing this now - because I have always loved the menu and the presentation of the food at Skinny Fats. The past couple of visits have just left me underwhelmed. \"You eat with your eyes first\" - so there's that I suppose! Happy eating to you :)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Staff was great, food was great although a bit pricey. But will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Place is has a dim lighting and smaller/tighter than expected but the food is the BOMB."}
{"text":"My daughter has been asking for awhile to go to SkinnyFats so we decided to go this past weekend. We went to the Warm Springs location as it being a Saturday night we thought the Dean Martin location would probably be packed.  Upon entering, the wooden plank walls painted with brightly colored emojis and artwork greeted us and we got in line. Placing your order at the counter and getting a number, the servers will deliver food to the table.  The concept of SkinnyFats is a fun one; there's a \"healthy\" option and a \"happy\" option, meaning it might be higher in caloric count, however, most options I noticed were still healthy.  Items ranging from breakfast to lunch, burgers to omelets, salads to shakes, there's a nice variety to choose from.  Items ordered, classic burger with fries for the kids, Smoke in a Bowl for me (grilled chicken in a smoky BBQ sauce atop brown rice and veggies, add avocado, husband got S'motherload burrito. We also ordered a Defense juice with extra ginger, freshly juiced there as it is ordered. Everything was really good.  Total minus tip was $61.00.  The clerk said they are putting one over in  Henderson/Green Valley Ranch area and one in Summerlin soon.  Looking forward to visiting those locations."}
{"text":"They do have some pretty unique stuff on the menu. I ordered the  \" boat to China \"  I think it was called and the \" cinnutella \". Something like that.  I was craving something sweet and healthy wasn't in the mood for any fast food.  My boyfriend warned me everything looks good but doesn't taste as good as it looks. Well, sad to say he was right.  The boat to china : was more on the healthy side. It looked so yummy , but ended up being just ok.  The cinnutella: smelled good. The fresh fruits on top made it look appetizing. But something about the taste was funky. I don't know if it was the sauce or the mixture of all the ingredients  Don't think I'll be coming back. But who knows. I might want to give it another shot. Wouldn't go out of my way for it. Maybe only if a friend suggested on going here."}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is good.. my issue is the line is always so slow to move... have you thought about doing online ordering to go? Or advertising off peak hours... I think since many changed a few months back quality has gone down too.."}
{"text":"Great place to eat hot, fresh food. Healthy and super filling choices. My salad was perfect. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This place is seriously good! I just popped my cherry today w/ a Cherry Popper Burger! Not the best burger in Vegas, but a really damn good burger! Great combination of items on the sweet roll, all the flavors mix to perfection. I love the layout of the place as well, comfy ass barstools as too!  They need to add one in the North Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Solid menu. Great food. Fast service. I typically make much healthier food choices than most I hang out with, so it's hard at times, to agree on a place that'll suit everyone's taste. SkinnyFats does just that. Love it. Great, creative menu with generous portions and quality ingredients. Check them out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for healthy food this is the place to go.  With a rotating menu and daily specials on their Instagram why not go here every day!  It's a little pricey but this is more like a restaurant then a fast food location.   The Juiced Drinks are super healthy.  But the menu has two sides, one healthy \"SKINNY\" and one heartier \"FATS\".   Either way you can't go wrong here!!!!!!!   I can see more locations being added in the future!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but kind of pricey for what you get. I wanted to call in an order to save time. They said they don't take orders over the phone. Why have a phone then?"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place on my drive from Vegas back to LA because I was looking for something healthy instead of the usual heart-clogging Mcdonald's and sleep inducing Denny's for the long road trips. First of all, this place isn't very big, seating is limited and the line was basically at the door. It took about 10 minutes before we ordered and another 10 minutes before we got the food. The waitress working there was SUPER FRIENDLY. Verging on too friendly. The type of friendly where they smile so hard, it looks like they are going to whip out a chopping knife and slice your head off type of friendly.   SALMON OVERBAORD (5/5):  I ordered the salmon overboard which was basically a cucumber boat with salmon poke on top, with some spicy-mayo type of sauce over it. It was great, delicious, refreshing and most importantly - LOW CALORIE. (340 Cals)  FLAT CHIX & GREENS (2/5): - This salad had way too much dressing on it, which made it hard to eat. - The chicken breast was so dry that I had a hard time swallowing it. I get that chicken breast is hard to keep moist, but man this was on the verge of rubber-texture.  - 296 calories  If you're looking for a great, healthy meal which is hard to come by on the road from Vegas to LA and vice versa, stop by here!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this moment for all my life      A second skinny fats!! And down the street from my office. This has to be heaven. I've already become a regular and I don't intend to quit. I even sent out a mass email in the office and almost everyone has been to try it.   Apart from the food I'd have to say my favorite part of this location is the layout. So much more room and gotta love the outside! If I could I'd eat outside all day every day. The furniture is of course cleverly recycled pallets. It's a great atmosphere all around.   Although I'm a bit upset they took away my favorite chopped salad I've ventured out onto the healthy side of the menu. One of my favorites has to be the hummus chicken sandwich which has sprouts on it. HUMMUS AND SPROUTS!!  If you haven't been to the new location, check things out for yourself."}
{"text":"The Good: Menu has many interesting and innovative items you wouldn't have at home.  Every time we go we don't know what to get until we get to the front of the line.  I change my mind about 5 times at least, but no matter what you get there is a good chance it will be amazing.  The food plating is nice.  The Bad: The place is hard to get to and too small and crowded. The place is packed every day for lunch till 3pm.  You'll spend about $15 per person here, but you get what you pay for.  The wait in line to order is over 10 minutes but it does give you some time to think of what you want, but maybe too much time.  The Bacon here is amazballs!  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Loved our food here! I had the berry waffle & my partner had the zucchini bowl with tuna. Food was prepared hot and very quickly despite how busy the place was. Cookies are fresh and sooooo soft. Highly recommend! Service was pleasant."}
{"text":"Skinny Fats is a hip little restaurant with an interesting menu. Split in half, you can choose to get either \"happy side\", or \"healthy side\" options. Needless to say, I stay happy! SF also has a full juice bar, inside and outside seating, and also beer.  I am becoming somewhat of a regular at this establishment after having numerous positive experiences. The staff is always extremely helpful and over time they have recommended some great dishes. During my last visit, Dannielle helped me along and set me up with the Big Parm and a green mile juice. Per the standard here, both were great.  I will be returning again soon."}
{"text":"There are 2 kinds of menus, healthy and fatty. Easy to see from the color.  We ordered salad, hamburger, and bowl.  All are so yummy, will come back again!"}
{"text":"Never a Disappointment at this Location. I Love the Cool Indoor Ambiance, Rustic yet Homey! They do have Outdoor Seating as well on those Beautiful Vegas Days.   Awesome Customer Service from The Order Counter, to Table Service. Friendly & Sometimes Playful, lol!   Your Order is presented in a very appealing & products are fresh, like the avocados that were on my Tu-Nuts. Oops, I forgot to mention....They do have a \"Skinny\" Version for those in a Health Conscious Kick, and they have the \"Fats\" Version of the Healthy Version...Hope that made sense...lol! I digress...  They do have Healthy and Happy Juices & Shakes like the Delicious Cucumber that are made on their Cold Press Side of the Eatery. I do believe they have Cucumber Water as well, but just ask them. ;)  The Tu-Nuts that I spoke of earlier consisted of Fresh Ahi Meat & Spicy Slaw, Sitting in a Cucumber Boat, sprinkled with Almonds, Teriyaki Sauce, Avocado Slices and, Sriracha Aioli, it was on their Shareable Menu, but I could easily eat all of the delicious goodness myself!   The Delicious Cucumber Shake that I had consisted of Juiced Cucumbers, Strawberries & Lemons, with your choice of Ice Cream or Froyo, 2% Milk, or Soy Milk.  Now that they have a location closer to me, I am a very happy girl!"}
{"text":"Never crossed my mind that I will be going to this place but omg it has been amazing! Their food was so delicious & I was so happy with what I ordered. It's busy though, high foot traffic. But definitely I enjoyed what I ordered with my friends. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious! They have a happy menu and a healthy menu so this place can accommodate all types of taste buds. I got the dabayou (sp?) double patty burger with Cajun sweet potato fries. Those were the best sweet potato fries that I have ever had! The burger was pretty tasty itself, not as big as I thought it would be but it was good enough for me and I shared it with someone. I also got the jazz hands float (vanilla frozen yogurt or you could choose to put vanilla ice cream, sprite, and chopped pieces of mango). Then me and 2 friends shared rediculous off the breakfast menu (more of a dessert....) which is a red velvet waffle with a lighter version of the cream cheese frosting, blackberries and raspberries, chocolate drizzle, bacon, and syrup on the side. The prize ranged but averaged I would say 10-15. Their smoothies were pretty expensive, about $10. Parking was decent. It's a small place, could probably fit like 30 people.   Also, they offer free hugs so I took up that offer and the cashier was nice and she gave me a hug and everyone else at my table decided to get a hug. The art on the inside of the restaurant is pretty cool as well. Service is awesome, people asked if it was out first time and it was since we were visiting from San Diego so one of the guys explained the menu to us (so many options!). People checked in with us and served the food to us. You pay at a register then you get your food so you don't have to worry about paying afterwards or how to split a check! :)"}
{"text":"Love SkinnyFATS food but this location is filthy. I always go to the location on Warm Springs but sometimes this one is on the same route as my next destination so it's more convenient however this place is unclean kind of nasty :("}
{"text":"At SkinnyFats if you go during lunch it is usually a very long line.  You order at a regester and can select from either a \"skinny\" list or a \"fat\" list.  There is basically a healthy and unhealthy version of everything.  I usually order a green juice and a \"skinny-q\" which is their version of a skinny bbq chicken pizza or this skinny greek pizza that is excellent.  The inside is very small with not a lot of seating so it can be very hard coming here for lunch because you aren't guaranteed seating by any means.  I've actually had to wait a long time to sit down.  I don't come here much anymore because there are a lot of places that serve similar food like Red Velvet Café that I don't have to worry about being able to sit down.  A lot of locals really love it here."}
{"text":"I just love this place! The food options are unique & creative, and always fresh & delicious. Even if I'm not hungry, I come for the fresh pressed juice. The customer service is outstanding, everyone's so friendly - and the girls are all so naturally pretty"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  I'm always looking for restaurants with healthy options,  and decided to try this place for breakfast. I was excited based on the great reviews, but left very disappointed.   The atmosphere is fun, with a super cute outdoor patio. The healthy breakfast menu is a bit small, but prices are not terrible.  I got the rosemary jane (chicken and waffles). The chicken was very dry and flavorless. I needed water to help it go down.  Yes...It was that dry.  The waffle was also very dry...more of a consistency like dry toast.    My friend got the 3 healthy chicks, and the egg whites were sooooooo bland.  Salt didn't help.   But the turkey patties were good at least.    And while the food was bad, the service was even worse. The extra plate we requested never came, we had to hunt down our side of pancakes, and not one person ever stopped to clear our plates, so our table was overflowing with dishes. We had them stacked 5 high at one point and still no one stopped.  I give it 1 star for atmosphere, and 1 star because they have healthy options in a world with too few restaurants offering that.  The lunch/dinner menu does sound good,  so because of that and because of all the other great reviews,  I will give it just one more try in the hopes I just visited them on a (very, very, very) bad day."}
{"text":"I love the concept! Healthy or happy...you choose! And you can make the healthy happy too!  Limited seating but there wasn't much waiting. Ordered the multigrain pineapple pancakes, side of fried eggs and real bacon (made it happy). Everything was delucious. Coffee was a little weak but I think Starbucks has changed my coffee palate for sure. Also ordered filet omelet. About average in taste but could be improved with maybe marinading the steak or more seasoning at a minimum. All in all it was a good value.  Service was fast and excellent!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. I had a burger with coleslaw and and egg on it. The flavors popped, yumm! The dining area is a little small, so watch out for the lunch rush. If you can, sit outside on the patio and enjoy your food in the sun. If you are hoping for a Coke with your meal you will be let down, they have their own weird soda varieties that just don't work for my tastebuds. The iced tea is a safe bet."}
{"text":"Chick-A-Waff-A-Doplis!!! I love me some skinny fats. The chicken was tender and juicy, waffles were crispy thick and fluffy. I got to change my waffles to the red velvet waffles free of charge! My boyfriend got one of their secret menu special the Filet O Fire. This was so yummy... seared filet mignon, pico de gallo, avocado, jalapeño and their homemade sauce on a buttery garlicky sourdough toast! plus a side, he got the truffle fries. YUMMY, they also have the own spicy ketchup! Jalalujah jalapeño catchup. BEST SPICY KETCHUP EVER!! We loved it so much we wanted to buy a bottle, ahaha funny thing was that they were selling it! But we came on a bad time, and they somehow ran out or they couldn't sell us the bottle at the time. Too bad we were leaving to Los angeles that day.... but fear no fear my cousin from Vegas bought me a bottle when she came visit me. I'm a happy camper, seriously going to buy more once I come back to Vegas!  Don't forget to take a look of their secret menu it is on their counter on their tablet, it's not hard to miss this \"secret menu\"  hahaha. I really wanted to try their fried benny too! that was on the special menu, but had a craving for waffles. Ugh I should have just order it hahaha. Next time...can't wait until i'm in Vegas this is probably my first stop!"}
{"text":"Always amazing service and food.  Katerina is always so pleasant and joyful!  Everything we order is amazing!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait, & then be prepared to say the wait was worth it!  Love this place!! They have such a good assortment of pretty healthy, pretty quick food. Really yummy breakfast, good snacks, delish salads and much more. I'm especially obsessed with their breakfast items. I do tend to stick to the healthy side, which to be honest doesn't taste TOTALLY healthy but oh well, I'm ok with that.   As for the service, so great!! Their staff is happy and friendly and competent. Always walk in to a smiling face.   Tips:  Seating - you have to wait around and stalk ppl who look like they're about to finish and that is perfectly fine, in fact it's the only way you're gonna get a table.  Food - Try the bruleed french toast..yum!! Also they have reallyyy great turkey bacon so I sub that instead of turkey sausage. The slow boat to china is a good little snack too!  They offer delivery and pick up is always super fast.  Enjoy and don't hang around too long, we're all waiting for a table :)"}
{"text":"Okay, so we were excited to check this place out.   It's really small inside. You order, and then find a place to sit. If there is a place. I sat down, and my husband went up and ordered. We took a menu as we walked in and used that, but there is a board you can order from as well.   The seating is tight. There is very interesting  music playing overhead. The waitresses were quick to clean the tables and bring our food. We got the free water that tasted like lemon, lime and I swear some jalapeño. But I could be wrong there. But it tasted spicy.   The Cluck Moo meat was perfectly done. The avocado was wonderful. However, the egg white was so watery that I had to sop up all of the water off of my plate. My toast was all soggy. Yuk.  The egg white completely overpowered the meat. You couldn't even see the meat in this dish. Fresh Morning  sandwich was tasty. The spicy jalapeño ketchup was pretty good, but it overpowered the whole sandwich.   I didn't really like that this place was so small and cramped. The food that we chose was healthy and tasty though, but not sure I will return. Food was decent, except for the really wet egg white."}
{"text":"Love this location. It's big and roomy, with a good amount of seating inside and out. Service was outstanding. The weather was really nice the day we went, and we were tempted to sit outside, but opted for an inside corner.   First time at this location, we decided to indulge and go for the 'Happy' side of the menu. Since it was still early, we were in the mood for breakfast. Top of the menu was the S'Motherload. Wow. We sort of glanced at the rest of the menu, but that one sounded amazing with filet mignon, sausage, potato, fajita pepper and topped with Cajun cheese sauce and pico. Yep, we chose that one. Oh, and there was a case of incredibly enticing cookies at the register, so I had to have one of those as well. Definitely going for the 'happy' menu here today.   As always, we split our meal. That might sound weird, but if we don't we are just too stuffed and miserable. Either that, or now we have to carry our food around with us while we run errands. Splitting works for us. Their soda was good. They serve Boylan sodas, which are made with pure cane sugar. It was a nice change from the 'usual' selections.   They brought out the burrito on a regular plate, no plastic or paper here! Real silverware was nicely wrapped and secured in a black napkin. They even brought out a second plate for when we split it. The burrito looked great, and tasted better! The tender pieces of meat and sausage were a bonus. The tortilla was nice and thin, not overwhelming like some places. So glad we tried this location, as the Dean Martin location is just too cramped for us, and also that we opted for the 'Happy' menu and not the 'Healthy'. So yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place the food issoooo good. One thing u need to know about this place if u have not yet been hear. Get early before 12, the seating is limited, if u do go late the line goes pretty quick but if u need to be in and out in a half hr this is not the place for u. So when u have more time in ur day then head to skinny/fats, best food. Give it a try."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is an ambient, chill touch. The food was surprisingly good. I like how they have a \"healthy\" menu and a \"happy\" menu with a diverse selection. I tried T.A.T.S and Hot Chix and I was impressed. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick brunch with family and extended family. Place is small so I would no recommend coming with such a large group as we did (11) but we made it work and took over 3 separate tables. across the board everything we tried was delicious, I was able to try a little of everyone's food and was not once disappointed. I personally ordered the curry over noodles and loved every bite. Only thing I did not enjoy was the blended fruit juice."}
{"text":"This location is pretty small only about 8 tables and a bar with stools. You order at the register then grab a table so you may have a wait. The line for the register was long but it went quick.   I had the AvocaToast which was good BUT if you like home cooking comfort food the Steak Eyes is phenomenal!! The gravy was FanFreakingTastic!   My only complaint would be our friend ordered the Super Berry protein waffles and there was mold in it from the berries. We let them know they fired a new dish but the new had moldy berries as well. Luckily she's not allergic but 2x's is not cool.   I will for sure be back but ordering from the happy side of the menu next time :)"}
{"text":"A interesting and delicious restaurant for both the person want to eat a lot or diet a lot. Service is excellent. Food is good   I have been to a few of these restaurants in town call ahead to fine out the size of the establishment plus some serve alcohol try it you might like it"}
{"text":"Very yummy place to eat lite and healthy or  filling you up to the max both are very delicious and worth the wait when it is pack. I will be back. I have enjoyed the small quaint one on Dean Martin and the more open and larger one on West warm springs. I am looking forward to checking on the other two."}
{"text":"Can't complain. Wish there was more parking and tables. But Anyways Plan on getting here before 11 if you don't wanna wait in line for 25 min lol alwAys crowded but that should tell you something. Sometimes customer service can be wishy washy but over all food is always on point. Even to go. Never soggy always fresh and creative new fun flavors!! A must to hit up in vegas!!!"}
{"text":"They have gotten rid of a lot of my favorite menu items in a menu change they had a little while ago. There aren't too many gluten free options now (including the fries which I really wish were gf). The atmosphere is trendy and cool. The locations are both very tiny for a sit down restaurant, and usually packed. That isn't a huge downside for me, but it can get crowded quickly. There are some really inventive and healthy options for non- gluten free people who love trying new food. Go for it (:"}
{"text":"So good! Crunchy fries! Cucumber water! Exciting menu! Honestly a really comfortable setting with friendly staff and great food. Can't wait to come back. 12June16  Side note: I was fortunate enough to come during slower times. The establishment is small and cozy so I can imagine it could get crowded with lack of seats and long lines. Worth!"}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to like this place but I have been there 3 times and EVERY time there was a problem. The first two times we ordered To-go from their website and it asked us to set a time we would like to pick it up. We got there on time and each time waited over 30 minutes passed our pickup time for our food. Whenever you ask the staff what's going on they say it will be right out. We ordered breakfast I didn't understand how that could take more than an hour. After about 20 minutes we saw the server that was working the cash register when I paid for my food was now done with her shift and walking to her car with 3 huge bags of food. So the staff stopped paying customers orders to cook for another staff member. So unprofessional. I was informed by the manager they would refund our money for the inconvenience after we waited another 10-15 mins for our food. So we decided to come a second time and used the website to order again and I'm not even kidding the exact same thing happened again, except this time we waited 45 minutes. So some time had passed (about 6 months or so) so we ordered again last night and went to pick up the food and my cinnaps shake tasted like vanilla ice cream so I asked if they could remake it considering it cost over $7 and the girl rolled her eyes at me and got on the radio and said \"This customer wants her shake remade\", then I see the cooks in the kitchen look out the order window with an annoyed look and she replied to them \"sorry guys\" like I'm crazy for wanting my shake made right! I got the shake and went to my car when I tasted it there was so much ginger it burned my throat. I was annoyed so I just went home. It was like they were being petty because I asked for a new one. The final straw was when I got home and my burger was well done and beyond dry when I asked for it to be cooked to medium. I will never spend another penny with this restaurant. They don't really seem to care about the customer. And the food is subpar when it should be amazing."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for the first time and OMG, it was awesome!!! I had chicken and waffles. My sister had a fabulous Greek flat bread. The cookies are served warm and they are HUGE! A must try!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean, exclusive place. I ordered one of each ahi taco and the ahi cucumber salad type thing. Both nice in presentation decent in flavor but some one was afraid of seasoning. That's off the skinny side of the menu. I would maybe try it again."}
{"text":"Delicious and filling. We ordered from the skinny side the Salmon Overboard with ginger cinnaps to drink. The other dish was the Sweet cheese us with truffle fries and the Sweet ginger to drink. Usually with restaurant food you are hungry or sick a couple of hours later. I was pleasantly full, ha ha. No serious,  the meal had perfect portions. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  The place was packed on Saturday, yet the wait time was less than 10 minutes from order to receiving our meal. Will return to SkinnyFATS and try another dish."}
{"text":"Skinny or fat...skinny ankles, fat butt, skinny waist, fat chest, skinny face and a fat cheesy smile after you get done eating at SkinnyFATS!   We came here for one of my birthday stops, so my friends allowed me to order everything I wanted even if it was excessive and more than I could eat. That way they were forced to eat everything with me and I got to taste a lot of dishes!  We ordered:  -Wake'N' Bacon: Applewood bacon, egg Frittata, Pepper back Jack, avocado, Sriracha scallion cream cheese on a Hawaiian roll served with country potatoes. (I substituted the turkey for bacon) The sandwich was delicious! I usually like my potatoes a little more well done but they still tasted good.   -Cherry Popper: half pound beef patty (we substituted a turkey burger), fried egg, pepper jack, spicy slaw pepper marmalade, on a Hawaiian roll. Wish I could eat this bad everyday!   -Hot Chix salad: buffalo chicken, romaine, fried jalapeño, blue cheese, pico, with avocado jalapeño ranch dressing. This tasted way too good to be considered a salad! This chix was hot,   -Balls .2-two deep fried spinach corn risotto balls with pesto aioli and bulls blood and micro greens. Winner, winner, chicken dinner! Order these! These were the clear winner of the meal! Everyone loved them!   - Frickles (off the secret menu) which are Fried pickle chips tossed in Cajun seasoning and served with our house made chipotle aioli. Yummy!   It's super cute inside but also small. They only have about 10 tables inside if that. This place is not off the strip and we had to take an Uber here. Even though it was inconvenient to get there it was still worth stopping by!   They serve fresh squeezed juice, shakes, and lots of healthy choices but I was not interested in any of those when I was there! You can leave skinny or fat...you decide!"}
{"text":"Came in for a takeout order - very long wait. Would have called ahead had I known. Past eating experiences have been awesome, cool stuff on the 'secret' menu - they should have a chalkboard or something that advertises it better. Not unhappy but if I had popped in on a lunch break I wouldn't have time to eat.  Update: the in store staff had misplaced my order and were very apologetic - offered me my next lunch on the house. also heard from the manager here on yelp and she offered to do the same. already loved the food and now been even more impressed by their customer service. this will continue to be one of my favorite lunch indulgences."}
{"text":"So happy I finally was able to eat here! Definitely will be back . I had the hot chix salad bowl very delicious!  Buffalo chicken bites, corn , crisp green beans, fresh crumbled blue cheese all on a bed of chopped lettuce. My boyfriend ordered the cherry popper burger which  consists of half pound beef patty, cherry and banana peppers,spicy slaw ,pepper jack and fried egg on a Hawaiian roll."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I found skinnyFats in Vegas! Went there with 3 others and everyone enjoyed their meals. Their menu is creative, and their concept is adorable :) I'm the type to go for mostly the \"happy\" (but fat) side of the menu but the \"healthy\" side looked delicious as well.   I had their chicken and waffles and enjoyed every bite. I had been dining out for so many days and although I ordered the chicken and waffles, I also ordered a fruit smoothie and I felt a bit less guilty about my meal. The smoothie was fresh, light, and delicious :)  I give one less star because we ordered a side of their truffle fries and there wasn't a whole lot of truffle flavor. We did enjoy them regardless, they were fried to perfection and we're all crazy for fries in general!  I was sad I didn't get to go back again during my last trip in Vegas but I will be back for sure on my next trip!"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to try this place out.  I have been wanting to try SkinnyFats for a while but had not got around to it. Yay!!  I decided to order from the fat side, ordered the buffalo chicken bowl with truffle fries. The portion was plenty to even take some home. I ordered a kids burger with fries for my 2 and 4 year old and they were able to share it.  My friend ordered the filet mignon bowl from the fat side and came with veggies and fried rice.  I tried her meal and it was delicious!  They have cucumber water which was very refreshing.   The employees were very welcoming and the food came out quickly.  I also went up to ask for a box and a container for the ranch and the young lady was kind enough to give me a fresh ranch to go.   Based on my experience I will be coming back to try food from the skinny side next time.  :)"}
{"text":"I love the burgers. I ordered no bun because I eat keto. A lot of different toppings to choose from!! I ate here after working out and it hit the spot. There were mushrooms and bacon on my burger with salad. Love the fun atmosphere, and the gourmet burgers. Staff is also really nice"}
{"text":"Skinnyfats is definitely one of my favorite places to go to. However, the food quality at this location isn't as amazing compared to the other two locations. The truffle fries are either soggy or stale, and my teriyahi lacked a lot of teri and ahi. Plus they got rid of a lot of great dishes. I've been here three times already and i'm hoping if i decide to go back it'll be better..... the staff and the atmosphere is amazing though! :("}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is the ultimate place to grub down. Such tasty, high quality meals to please anyone's taste- you can even customize your order and do it up how you like! (For you picky eaters out there!) I really can't say enough about this place... Indoor/outdoor dining, mobile/ online ordering for takeout, friendly staff, awesome variety, adorable puns, fresh juices and smoothies... MmMm"}
{"text":"Everything I've gotten at SkinnyFATS has been excellent, no matter if it is from the \"skinny side\" or \"fat side\". The flatbreads and sandwiches are all wonderful. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm !!!   I will definitely be returning to enjoy some delicious food here. The decor is amazing!!!!   SkinnyFATS is not like any other brunch restaurant. Here our order your food as if you are at a fast food restaurant and then you get a number, and pick a seat. Once seated a server will bring you your food and any other necessities you may need.   Food I ordered their chicken and waffles and my fiancé ordered a breakfast burrito. He loved his burrito, but I wasn't impressed with the chicken and waffles. The chicken was pretty plain and nothing to make me order it again. However; I'm willing to give the food a second shot. I've seen some great items on the menu that I want to try.  Drinks They offer alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks. The sodas are all natural and I've heard great things about their smoothies.   Environment - Seating The restaurant is really clean with limited seating inside and out. They do have barstool seating by the kitchen with tv's for sports fans. They offer outdoor seating which is a must for their Summerlin location."}
{"text":"This was such a great find and a hidden gem in Vegas. Although I love the concept of a healthy and happy side, being the gluttonous couple that my boyfriend and I are, ordered only off the happy side of the menu. It was so worth it.   Cherry popper burger: Had some of my boyfriend's and it was so good. The burger was incredibly juicy, the Hawaiian roll was soft and slightly sweet, and the banana and cherry peppers are what makes it! Nice pop of flavor. Also, the fries was crispy and had a nice, subtle truffle taste.   Smotherload: This was huge and filling. It came with sausage and filet mignon cooked to your liking (medium rare), eggs, potatoes, and pico. It was topped with a Cajun cheese sauce, which I thought was only okay.. I didn't like how gritty and not smooth it was as a sauce.   They also have a secret menu! We got the Happymess, which was truffle fries with strips of NY steak, pico, and got the blue cheese on the side. Way too much food, but it was all worth it.   For juices, we got the hangover remedy and green mile. Both were good and a perfect pre-hike boost.   To top off the night, we got the chocolate chip cookie, soft and chewy with huge chunks of chocolate chip.  If only I lived in Vegas, I would come here to try all the healthy dishes."}
{"text":"Found this gem after arriving at the airport. I love this little spot! We tried the STEAKation sandwich, tofu scramble, flat chix salad, TRUFFLE FRIES, and more. Everything was great and came out quickly. Staff was super friendly :) We also tried some juices/shakes. The delightful cucumber is just delightful-- froyo, strawberries, and cucumber blended. Came in a reusable cup! Awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm not a healthy eater but they have a selection for all. Their cream cheese waffle option is pure evil and so very good. A little pricey but they are good."}
{"text":"Healthy or happy? I would definitely have to go with happy. Skinnyfats has a ton of stuff on their menu. I decided to try it out with one of my friends for dinner on a Monday night. I was a bit confused about the location but it is pretty convenient for lunch if you work in that area.   It was fairly busy when I got there. They could tell I was a newbie and the lady explained to me the healthy side and the happy side. She also told me breakfast was served all day. I had already decided to get the Chix on Broadway even before I stepped foot into the door and that is what I got.   The verdict. A big piece of chicken on the yummiest bun with some truffle fries. I only ate half as it was hearty or maybe I was just trying to be \"healthy.\" ;) the chicken was moist and tender and nothing was overly salty or under salty. My friend liked her BLT (forgot the official name) as well.  There was also Heinz jalapeño ketchup on the table which gave the fries a lil zing.   Overall, I would definitely come back. I want to try the breakfast one day. Seating is limited and is on a first come first serve basis. I liked skinnyfats and I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"Uh can I say it's amazing that skinnyfats is so close to me?! Yes! Although we went during opening weekend and the to go was crazy. Yes we did to go but it was still worth the wait. It was my husband's first time there and we both ordered the Chix on Broadway. I think I liked it more the second time around if that's even possible. For $10 the sandwich is well worth it. The chicken is huge and I can never finish all of it which you know is a rare occasion for this girl.  Overall, the take out was pretty easy and once they get running more they will take online orders. This place is a must try for everyone!"}
{"text":"I love SkinnyFats! You can decide when you get there whether you want to be naughty or nice. Both sides are great but I leave naughty. Tip: They have a different special Sunday Benedict every week. Check out their IG to see what their special is. For dinner, the cherry popper burger is fire in every way. One of my favorite burgers anywhere. Can't leave without a cookie to go! Peanut butter is my favorite."}
{"text":"Decided to finally check this place out. I was a little skeptical as I'm not a huge fan of going to \"hipster\" places. However, I am trying to find some other alternatives to somewhat healthier eating.  We ordered the Cherry Popper burger, which had a nice kick from the cherry/banana peppers. The truffle fries came with the burger and were way overcooked and plain as hell. The Right Stuffed was a little bit of a let down, but when I reheated it at home, it tasted better... ?  We also had an order of the Tu-Nuts, which had extremely fresh ahi. That dish had so many different flavors that tied together so well. I usually stay away from sweet potato fries because they usually taste terrible but their truffle version was fresh and not oily. I actually ordered another serving to take home.   I definitely want to come back and try some of the breakfast items and juice/smoothie options. $8 for 21oz of juice sounds like a deal to me."}
{"text":"They aren't kidding when they brag about themselves. The menu is awesome. You'll be lucky to get seating. I wish there were some Skinny Fats near me. I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, great service even though it was pretty busy. Chicken and waffles and avocado toast were really good. They have fresh made juices too, which are all excellent."}
{"text":"Tried this place out about a month ago. We got their for brunch and there was a decent amount of people waiting to order. Luckily, we were able to find a table. We got their green juice with kale, apple, spinach and celery, which tasted too healthy for us but we still finished it. For food, we got a superstar burrito and the naked chix-i added pineapple to it for extra dollar. The portion was pretty generous, the food tasted great. I am not big fan of american brunch, but I actually enjoyed my food here. The chicken was very tender and the mango basil sauce went really well with the brown rice and the chicken. Adding pineapple to it made the dish a little for tastier for me. Since their warm springs location is only 5 minutes away from my house, I would go there when I feel lazy to cook on a Saturday lunch."}
{"text":"After visiting SkinnyFats several times, I love the menu and the food.  I primarily choose from the Skinny side, but dropped in for breakfast once and we all agreed the food tasted great, as usual. The staff has always been friendly, helpful and attentive.  The one challenge with this location is that it is small and can get crowded quickly, so it is a consideration if going in a group during a rush."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is hands down one of my most favorite lunch spots. You are always greeted with a smile, and served promptly.  I love that they offer something for everyone. Literally options  For the meat loving men and women, the calorie counters, and the vegg heads like myself.  I had a black bean burger called the mean bean. It was fantastic, and HUGE. I had a few different options as a side, but I went with the French fries. (The french fries are sinfully delicious.) My husband got the buffalo chicken strips. They smelt amazing, looked scrumptious, and let me tell ya- they did not last long. He raved about those things for days! I've gotten the balsamic salad in the past and it was also super delicious.  This spot is family friendly, and great for any lunching occasion. I totally recommend checking them out, and eating your way down their menu. I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I love this skinnyfats location!! It's so clean inside and my friends and I love trying new menu items. The staff is on point and very friendly. The Spicy Latina soup is a favorite of mine, and on the weekends I love the different Benedicts."}
{"text":"The place is the \"bomb!\" Especially loved the soda machine, which is made with sugar cane."}
{"text":"Holy Sh#t!!! I am blown away by this place. I have a feeling that it's gonna be added to one of my go to spots in Vegas as well as a place to bring out of town visitors. anyway, the place is not big and a bit hidden but it's well worth the wait and search. food is freakin delicious. had the cherry popper. one of the best burgers I've had in my life. yes,  it's like that. I can't wait to try other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is delicious ! Would definitely come back with my family. Customer service is amazing. Greeted us from start to finish. It's just simply amazing."}
{"text":"much needed healthy option in Sin City! I know it's only been 7 months or so since they opened but they need to expand soon :) their juices were solid"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times. AMAZING food! Great quality and great combinations. It's definitely great when you want something healthy. I have tried a few different dishes and everyone has been cooked to perfection. The juices are delicious! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is fantastic! I love the variety and the fact you can eat healthy, and be a little naughty and order from the \"fattening\" side.  The hours are nice and you can order ahead to pick up if needed. Everything is as good as it looks!  I'm hungry just reviewing it."}
{"text":"A family favorite of ours! Pretty much everything they ever make us delicious! Menu always changes. Sometimes it's frustrating when your favorite leave but, I like it because it forces you to try something new!"}
{"text":"As promised, the food was a good mix of fat and healthy. Atmosphere was definitely fun and hip and the staff friendly and helpful. It is unfortunately not located in the most easily accessible or visible part of vegas, but there is a helpful billboard with a large arrow showing you the way! We stopped here on the way to Zion National park for lunch, and were all satisfied with the tacos we got. We went with the healthy side of the menu and had food envy looking at the surrounding tables. Would love to come back and try the Dark Side of the menu, but was satisfied with our selection The service was quick and friendly and we were offered explanations and help with the menu."}
{"text":"265. I literally typed in 'dinner' and this showed up. Glad they were open on Labor Day!  It's located in a commercial area, so don't be fooled by the lonely buildings and empty lots. There's a trendy and yuppie vibe inside the restaurant with a cool menu that has a Healthy Side and Happy Side (aka notsohealthy). They do have a few specials featured on the flat screen that are not on the menu.  I ordered the Slow Boat to China with a side of truffle fries. Orders came out fairly quick. My Slow Boat was similar to a sushi roll without the rice. It wasn't overly spicy, which I appreciated. Wish it were less salty. Truffle fries are truffle fries-- always yummy, can't go wrong with them.  Great comfort food for a fair price. Definitely worth trying this place at least once if you haven't been here.  __________ My 2¢: - Vegetarians: They are veggie-friendly, ask for the vegetarian menu!"}
{"text":"Every Sunday, my boyfriend and I come for dinner. Every time we are greeted with the biggest smiles & \"Welcome Back!\" We love coming to SkinnyFATS for the food, environment, and the music. My favorite is the grilled cheese & tomato soup from the secret menu. We get the Sunday Sundae every week to share and it's the best part of our week. We bring all of our visitors here & they always want to come back! I will miss this place the most when I move away from Vegas."}
{"text":"First time at SkinnyFATS and it was amazing. Everything was made fresh and it didn't take long to get to us.   Country style steak medallions melts in you mouth like butter and the cornbread was a welcome twist to the meal.  Tacos were really good but has a kick, I love the ahi with slaw.  Chicken and waffles was very tasty and the breading on the chicken has a nice crunch to it.  How come I've never been here before is the question I've been asking myself"}
{"text":"I came in and had the blaze of thunder and the fried pickles. Dylan had recommended both and they were delicious. Can't wait to come back and try something else"}
{"text":"So Nikki was taking my family's order, and noticed my hesitation when she mentioned the truffle fries because I had them before and wasn't the biggest fan (they seemed soggy to me). So I asked for extra crisp ones and Nikki promised she would make sure herself that they were crisp & that I was satisfied. True to her promise she came out and asked how the truffle fries were, and they were indeed crispy but for whatever reason I still wasn't a fan of them. She offered to bring out plain fries (because my 3yr old son had them and I preferred those), but I declined. Nevertheless, and again true to her promise to ensure I was satisfied, she had some plain crispy fries brought out.  All of the staff last night seemed eager to please, and my wife and I felt like rock stars given the way we were being treated.   The food is great, the service is awesome."}
{"text":"So excited to have a skinny fats on this side of town! Even though it was packed on Monday the staff were super accommodating and offered some free cookies for what they thought was a long wait!! Food was fresh and so good!!"}
{"text":"I ate at this place while on vacation in Las Vegas. My date is a Vegas local and knew all the local amazing EATS of Vegas. THIS WAS MY FAVORITE restaurant there.. I had the truffle fries, it was packed with flavor and outright delicious, my friend kept digging in my plate. We also had the craburkey burger to share and salad. I love the flavored teas as well. I would definitely go back to this place the next time I'm in Vegas... small place, but over all I loved it"}
{"text":"An interesting selection between healthy and hearty xD. The vibe and service is great and friendly.  The menu overall is unique and with some witty, funny names xD. Great place for some free delicious, fruit water.  The dishes are done very well with a nice presentable, arty feel to them. Try it out because there's something for everybody for a decent price!"}
{"text":"The new is always exhilarating, but after many return visits, the meals aren't so spectacular.  Originally every dish was so interesting and delicious, but thinking about it now.  The prices to me can be lowered and still do well for business.  The music is hip and refreshing and so is the decoration.  Most definitely the vibe and the cool is here, but speaking about the most important, the food, I don't feel it's worth the \"healthy\" approach, cuz I can cook myself, or visit other locations that have a better budget, better dishes, and a not so crowded, overhyped hip vibe and wait.  It's not at all a bad business or restaurant, give it a try i'm certain you'll like it.  As a regular place for me, however, I'm over it :P"}
{"text":"Great idea for a restaurant! My vegan mom was pleased with the healthy side, and I loved the fish tacos I got. Waaay larger portions than I anticipated. Everyone left happy :)"}
{"text":"Great food!! Love this place! I wish the dinning area was bigger but the service is always good. I've tried almost everything on the menu and can't say one bad thing about the food."}
{"text":"First time here. Great menu if youre watching what you eat. Came for lunch on a sunday and the line wasnt so bad. This place is quite small so be prepared to wait for a seat or order to go. Will be coming down here again if im down at this area. Amazing customer service!!! +++"}
{"text":"First time here ordered pimp shrimp tad bit spicy but a good spicy and I also ordered the melt down burger delicious with the Parmesan garlic fries omg to die for cute decor all round restaurant had a variety of sitting options bar sitting if you go for lunch yourself booths tables outside sitting big party sitting will definitely be returning can't wait to try other things on menu my only thing was let them know how you would like your burger cooked they didn't ask I was too overwhelmed with so much too look at I completely missed it burger was still bomb"}
{"text":"Perfect! Now my new Favorite Restaurant for lunch! Every dish is healthy AND scrumptious!. This place is now on my visitors tour! My friends and family are worth it!  If there were more than 5 Stars, I'd allot them! I ate from the healthy side of the menu and expected to be less than wow'd. It was one of the best and most exquisitely delicious meals I've had this YEAR! I'm raised in the business, and I know the goods when I see and taste them! Bravo SkinnyFATS! You are the poster child for creativity and addictively delicious taste!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas where I can take my kids and know they are eating nutritious food. My kids describe the food as yummy, happy, and \"TA-DA.\" All the juices are beautiful and refreshing. The SkinnyFATS Punch is our favorite smoothie.  Their service is exceptional. My toddler loved chatting with Halle. She took the time to chat and laugh with my little boy which makes him and I both very happy. The ambience and music is hipster, chill, and youthful. My boys love to dance and watch the planes go there."}
{"text":"It had a really nice atmosphere and the Staff were really friendly and helpful! The food was delicious~ I ordered the Wake N Bacon.  I didn't expect it to be a burger, but it was a good size that filled me up.  It had a lot of Avocado which I liked~ Also, since their theme is Go Green, you can actually take your soda drink~ Also their Soda are Cane Sugar Soda."}
{"text":"So...I gave it another try. I still give it the same rating.   I ate here a few months back and was not impressed with the food. I ordered one thing from the healthy side and one thing from the happy side. Both items were drenched in thick sauces that overpowered the taste of everything. I was disappointed and said I wouldn't be back.   Fast forward a few months.... I decided to give this place a shot after seeing a bunch of new photos from various people's Yelp pages. I invited a few friends here for lunch. And since they've never been, I thought it would be fun to try it out.   Once again, I ordered the Ahi Taco-San. Battered ahi in a crunchy shell. Once again, the sauce was really heavy. I needed 5 napkins for one taco. I also ordered the chicken and waffles since another friend of mine said it was good. The waffle was nice and fluffy and didn't get soggy with the syrup. The chicken had a good crunch outside and was juicy on the inside. However, the breading was a bit salty. I had my friend taste it and she agreed it was a bit salty.   My friends ordered the BLT and the Phatty Philly. They also agreed that everything was so heavy and drenched in sauce. Neither of them finished their food because it was too much. My friend ordered a cookie without it being heated up. This was a big mistake because it was rock hard. One awesome employee, Rica, replaced the hard cookie with a warm one, which was so much better and softer.   I am sad to say that after giving it a second chance, this isn't one of my top places to eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, healthy, fun, diverse menu. Unique dishes. I just wish they offered gluten free sandwich bread for their tempting array of sandwich and burger options. I had the mango chicken bowl and it was amazing. I devoured it. My daughter had the burger and she said, \"It was glorious.\" ;)"}
{"text":"Had the 3 Healthy Chicks. Was super good. Plenty of food had leftovers. Definitely will go back when I'm out in Vegas :) this was take out."}
{"text":"A little over the top with some food combinations that don't really work together but the atmosphere is A+ and I only tried two dishes.  I would go back, for sure.  Like the efforts at being innovative."}
{"text":"Live Happy or Live Healthy.   Today was a healthy day...ahi tacos (cannot miss)...slow boat to China (cucumber salad)...wedgie salad...kids loved Naked Chicks (mango chicken tenders).  We love this place because it is noisy and you do not have to worry about being too quiet.  Everyone that works here is always so friendly.  Seating is fairly limited especially for groups bigger than 4, but we always manage to find a seat.  We are locals and will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Seating sucks. Come when it's dead.  Trust me on this. I came here with my gf around noon and it was packed enough that we had to stand around waiting for a table to open up, and they have very few tables.   The menu is divided up by \"Healthy\" and \"Happy\", the former is which is ostensibly good for you while the latter is undeniably not. We shuffled around the board a bit with our orders. I got Mr. Flapjack (I think that's what it was called); basically two protein pancakes (they add in whey protein powder) with bananas and syrup, along with turkey bacon. My chick went with the popular cranburkey sandwich. And we also got an order of specialty fries, that turned out to be a mistake.   The flapjacks were quite good, as far as flapjacks are concerned. It's not exactly the pinnacle of breakfast items. I am of the opinion that bananas make (nearly) everything better, so their inclusion here was enough to make me happy. I'm also a guy who tries to get a good amount of protein in with each meal, so having 18g (is that each? not sure) added into these pancakes satisfied my needs. Turkey bacon sucks. It always sucks. No matter how good someone tries to make it sound, it's never as good as real bacon. But if you want to eat something healthier, it's there. Personally, I would've liked some applewood smoked bacon thick as Jessica Simpson's thighs.  The fries. We ordered these special fries - which I can't seem to find on their online menu, and the name escapes me - but they were a mad doctor's concoction of sweet potato fries, balsamic vinegar, feta (might've been goat) cheese, and chicken. And I think some nuts might have been involved. It's one of those dishes someone thinks up while they're high, and you'd probably have to be in a similar mindset to eat them. Did. Not. Work."}
{"text":"My favorites on the menu are the filet o fire and Tu nuts. I love their creativity with food presentation."}
{"text":"Amazing store!! I have eaten at other skinny fat locations and this is by far the most professional and clean locations in town. I will travel the further distance now to attend. I was helped by Laura who was so cheerful. I tend to make my order slightly complicated so it was nice to receive my order correct and cooked to my liking. Thank you Laura and all employees at this skinny fats location!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across the lil gem when surfing for a good breakfast spot. It's not too far from strip and the food was good. It's small but setup nicely. We ordered the breakfast burro and the cherry popper both good. They have plenty of healthy options also. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I have only been to Vegas once....however we did not stop. Best food I've eaten in awhile.  I love chipotle but this place where is better!!  I recommend tacodilla. If you see a cashier and her name is Katie she is super upbeat at will just make you do nothing but smile.(she should get a raise to be honest). EAT HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Eclectic menu, great vibe, off the strip, excellent food, inexpensive and super friendly staff.  We found this local joint because we were on that side of town.  Had the CauliFire (good and spicy), Smotherload (breakfast burrito) and the Sweet Cheese Us (cheese steak sandwich) and some drink I don't remember name.  All were really tasty but my favorite was the Sweet Cheese Us. The bun was soft with a nice chew and snap, meat was tender and cheese was perfectly paired.  Smotherload was good but next time I would ask for less potatoes and more egg.  Love this place, will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for business and after leaving a client meeting was starting to get hungry for lunch.  I fired up Yelp on my cell phone and saw the reviews for SkinnyFATS and that is was close by.  The location is in a somewhat random spot - really like an industrial/business complex.  We got there before noon and there was already a decent sized line in front of us.  The only negative would be the size of the restaurant as they do not have enough seating to accommodate the volume of business they have coming in but I'm guessing for the locals that work nearby, they probably get a lot of take out business.  I was with 2 other coworkers and we all ordered something different and each of us thoroughly enjoyed our meal and were also eying each other's choices.  We shared an order of their sweet potato fries and those were the best I've ever had.  Great little spot with some healthier options.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I liked it.  Unique interior and my foods was great.  Also, kids burger looked great and my son ate the entire thing.  If kids meals are junky, I never go back.   I am looking forward to going back and trying chicken sandwich or burger.  Only bad thing was that the tables are on first come first serve basis so you could order and have no place to sit.  Prices are on the higher side for a stand in line to order place."}
{"text":"Loved everything about it! Food service and Ambience was great. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Loved this place, definitely want to revisit and try other things on the menu. The atmosphere was great, location is awesome, lots of parking. I ordered the Cluck moo, with a side of sweet potato fries. Possible the best SPF i have ever had! excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Great place. From healthy food to the \"Happy Side\". First impression was a hole in the wall, just another food place but I was caught off guard. I was greeted right away. The girls there explained the whole menu and off the menu items. Super friendly. Nothing but good vibes n good eats."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I ended coming here with two friends and it was our first time.  This place was great! Had the Turkey Bacon Lettuce Tomato sandwich and I licked my plate clean.  So good! I highly recommend visiting this place whenever someone is going to Vegas. You won't be disappointed. They have something for everyone...a healthy side and a happy (aka fattening side for those that are not watching their weight) side.   Just keep your eye open when driving there.  Their front entrance is small and non-descriptive and it's easy to pass by when driving.  Also, not a lot of seating available and it's first come first serve regarding seating so it might be best to take your order to go but other than that it's a great place to eat at.  I'm  just bummed that they don't have one in NY or NJ"}
{"text":"Its a first come first serve restaurant where you order at the cashier and they bring your order to the table. Its kind of hard to find but i guess its useful so it doesnt get that much of rush. (Its a pretty small place). The place itself looks really unique.  The Shroomin' in Philly is to die for."}
{"text":"Been to this place a couple times and I have no complaints, everything Ive tried is good. I love how their menu is divided into a happy side (fatty) and a healthy side! I always choose the healthy side and just pick on my boyfriends happy side plate. Tried one of their juices as well, they were pretty good but just a little pricey. Next time I come I need to try the spicy Latina soup, heard it was good!"}
{"text":"OMG delicious! This place has been around the corner from my home and I'm so upset I didn't go sooner! Their Sunday Sundae deals are amazing! The environment and style is very fresh and the employee's are really great. Even my six year old liked eating there. We will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Amazing service every time! I'm never disappointed with Skinny Fats! Definitely one of my favorite places in Las Vegas! Please open more locations LOL"}
{"text":"We ordered the steak eyes, applebottom toast and their Sunday sundae special. For the steak eyes, the biscuit was fresh and soft, the egg was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. The sausage was different than what you would expect but tasty. Good portions as well. Everything made with quality ingredients. Check out their instagram for daily secret special."}
{"text":"Love that we finally have skinny fats on this side of town! Not to mention it's in a perfect, easy to get to location, right off the 215.  Everything my husband and I have ordered so far (happy side to healthy side ) has been amazing. It's hard to pick a favorite dish."}
{"text":"This is an interesting concept - a smart casual restaurant that has a healthy side and a happy side of a menu.   I came here with my girlfriend and a friend, and we had a few things. We split an order of the Cauliflower with Buffalo Sauce. I had the Smoke in a Bowl, which was chicken with a BBQ flavor, peppers, pineapple, over brown rice.   The food was pretty decent, but I'm docking a few stars for a couple reasons. One, I ordered my Smoke in  a Bowl without the chopped onion, which they not only forgot, but when the waiter brought it out, I mentioned \"I ordered this without onion\", not only did he not take it back to fix it, he just shrugged his shoulders and walked away.   Second, if you are going to advertise and claim to be a healthy restaurant, I would think you would do the obvious and put basic nutritional information on the menu, or even your website. Nothing. Not posted anywhere obvious. So while you claim that food is healthy, there is nothing to help you choose wisely particularly if you are tracking calorie consumption."}
{"text":"This place is very good I was surprised how good it was Vegas is a hard place to get fresh healthy food but this is one of them. Very good food cool place to eat I had the red velvet chicken and waffles and they were off the Hook!! Mmmmm yea definitely one of my go to spots when In Vegas."}
{"text":"I have to say this is why I love yelp! After my post the SkinnyFATS owner reached out and asked I give it another try. I love second chances so I thought sure! I think my first time round I may have chosen poorly and on my second visit I was much happier. Some items like the fresh juice did still seem costly, but the beef tacos are 2 for $7.95 and they are delish. I also had a beef salad that was really great too. Lastly if you're feeling bad the truffle fries were SO good. Bottomline, better experience this time and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Called over the phone for pick up on my way to work and got a cherry popper. Got to work and saw that there was a mistake and got cheese on my burger. Called and let the woman on the phone know and was treat with disrespect. Jennifer was amazing though, she fixed it all and will definitely come back because of her!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is Seriously the best place to come to in the morning !! even the women's and men's bathroom are a pleasure to be in !!!  The wake N bacon is so amazing !!! Super friendly staff and amazing food !!! Literally just made a yelp account just to put an amazing review in for my favorite place in Vegas sense moving here a week ago !!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the wait staff very helpful. They have a number of unique dishes. They actually took back my daughters order when it had sauce she didn't like and then comp'ed her meal when they forgot to replace it. We received an apology from every helper in the restaurant. Fantastic service for something that could have been handled so much worse! Thanks SkinnyFats!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden where nobody would expect to find it. I was almost thinking it wasn't real until I saw their sign outside.   Anyways. I LOVED this place. The atmosphere, the food, the cost!  We got the chix on broadway with truffle fries, the chicken and waffles, and the chicken tenders with sweet potato fries.  Everything was delicious and not to mention the size of the chix on broadway was HUGE!  Reasons why they do not get 5 stars though:  -Menu has weird names without telling you exactly what you are getting. I had to refer back to pics on yelp to really get an understanding of what a few of the items were.  -It was our first time here, we didn't know whether to seat ourselves or where to order. Instead of greeting us, or a few other people who came in, the waitresses seemed to walk past us. We caught on by watching other people go up to the counter and order.  -location is weird. Next to the 15 close to the strip club and kinda out of the way.  But all in all, I absolutely loved this place and will be returning to try out so much more!"}
{"text":"The place is kind of small, but it was clean and the staff was friendly. You have to order at the counter, so if a seat opens plant your stake.   I had the Steak Eyes which consisted of two Country Fried fillet medallions on top of two jalapeño cornbread with gravy and two perfectly cooked eggs (scrambled my preference). I had fillet the night before and it wasn't as good as this place. It wasn't rare, but it was tender and juicy. I enjoyed the sweet and savory, but the cornbread was a little too sweet for me, so I ate it as a side/desert.   The potatoes were were crisp and seasoned just right.   Be careful when putting pepper on your food. Make sure the plug to fill it is in place.   Wish I would've taken pictures of the inside.   Great place. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"skinnyFATS a contradiction in itself is a restaurant that offers healthy or \"soul food.\" So depending if you don't mind gaining a little fat or if you're trying to slim down and eat healthy, this place has those options.  Juice: They offer juices ranging from your typical all veggie green concoction to your regular fruit drink.  A bit overpriced for a $9 juice when you can get a entree from around that price.   Food: The cherry popper is all you need to know.  A nice juicy burger that sits on two hawaiian buns that also comes with a side.    Overall: After working out I'm always too tired to go home and make something so if you're looking for clean eats after a workout or if you just want something tasty, come on over to skinnyFATS"}
{"text":"Food was good but guess with 4.5 stars I had super high expectations. $28 for two sandwiches, no drinks. Staff will deliver food but there is no waitstaff. Place is not on the strip which is nice!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Our only regret is that we are on vacation and can't eat here every day for the rest of our lives. Also, I didn't get their names, but the staff was super friendly and helpful and deserves recognition. To whomever the owner is, whoever was working today around 2:30, ALL of them deserve recognition."}
{"text":"Excellent service with friendly environment i wish i could go back again unfortunately i m on vacation and wish we had something like it in Hawaii  The food was prefect, delicious and you will think because its skinny and healthy u will get a small portion i was wrong it was filling and very healthy  The servants were happy and fast at your order!  I like the presentation of the arts  on the wall i will be posting few picts and will strongly recommended to give it a try"}
{"text":"Very kind staff, decent beer list, and super disappointing food. There's a lot to choose from and a good amout. I might of been ruined by all the hype it's received.   OK so the manager reached out to me and asked for another shot, they were much better. Review amended."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.   So happy they decide to open up a location here on the west side.    Delicious food,  helpful and friendly employees,  and a wonderful atmosphere.  I love the outside patio and seating they have created.  Healthy and delicious food and at  reasonable price.   ."}
{"text":"I really liked skinny fats. In the vein of Las Vegas this off the strip, pretty industrial area restaurant with an unassuming exterior had great, great options.  Anytime a restaurant has craft soda I'm sold. And the numerous interesting dishes they had had me and my friends wondering what to get. We all were super pleased with the food and the service, but the place is sooooo tiny. Once you enter you're pretty much in line, and have to wait for a table to open with your number in your hand. Once you get a table your set, but this is definitely not a place for a group bigger than six. Would definitely return to try some of the other dishes here!"}
{"text":"Where Happy and Healthy menus invite everyone to dine together.   Monkey do:  BROWN-sweet potato pancakes, bacon (this on menu as \"Sweet Brown\" with brown sugar sauce, powdered sugar and marshmallows-but no thanks) This Monkey's favorite pancakes in Vegas. Although I've looked...  Nothing comes close!   2 EGGS on side GREEN MILE- green pressed juice  Always friendly and helpful service here. A bit on the spendy side, but nice environment indoor and outside patio. More sporty than hipster. Good music and always a game on tv. Been here several times for lunch and dinners. Great choices can be hard to make while standing in line. But don't worry, they are always helpful and patient. Maybe check out menu online first, especially for the specials.  They feature a special Benedict every weekend.  Check i"}
{"text":"WOW! My last review I commented that maybe I will \"try takeout\" to avoid the uncomfortable restaurant experience I seem to always have there. Well that didn't end to well for me today!  Ordered takeout from there online system to have a pick up time of 12:40pm. On arrival we were given another persons bag of food. We got all the way home and discovered their error. Mind you when I called Skinny Fats they admitted they ALREADY KNEW they gave us the wrong bag of food but proceeded to NOT CALL US, even though they had our number!  When I spoke to the arrogant \"shift lead\" woman on the phone she did not even offer ANY apology. Her words... \"oh yeah there was a mix up and we have your food here if you want it. Its waiting in the hot box\"   I STRESS ...NO APOLOGY! Not even offering to make our food again since by the time we eat the food it will be an hour old. Food thats been sitting around in their \"hot box\" GEE THANKS  My husband went back to the restaurant to pick up our old food.   I waited about 5 minutes and called back to file a complaint with the manager and the same woman answered again but denied it was her who I spoke with and when I asked to speak with a manager she said none was available today. How convenient. She proceeded to ask if we wanted the food delivered at no charge. I said, \"but you told me 5 minutes ago that if I wanted the food I could come back and pick it up that its sitting in the hot box, NOW you are telling me you would have delivered it? My husband is already on his way\"  her response was \"sorry its busy\"  Guess being BUSY at Skinny Fats means all customer service goes out the window."}
{"text":"The decor wins major style points. Fake grass, bright colors, wooden accents, it all creates an inviting atmosphere that makes you want to stay.   For our visit, we stopped in to pick up a green juice to go, and we were able to enjoy the ambiance, as we waited for the staff to whizz up my concoction. I received my healthy green juice in a cool reusable container, which also doubled as a great marketing tool for the business, as my sturdy gas station type sippy cup drink was plastered in fun logo jargon.   Love what they are doing here at Skinny Fats."}
{"text":"Great concept, great menu and great staff.  A little cramped, but that's because it's so popular.  Half of the menu is \"healthy\" items and the other side is \"happy items\".  I ordered off the healthy side and it was great.  Pleeeeease open one in OC!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great idea healthy and happy food together. My family and I were from out of town and needed a place that offered healthy choices for my wife and I but our two teenage boys always want the yummy stuff that may not be as good for you. They had BOTH, and the flavor combinations were awesome. I had the protein waffle and my wife had the WTFrench toast. The boys had the chicken and waffles and the red velvet waffles everyone was happy. We also tried a Mr. Green juice, very good, if you know what green juice is suppose to taste like. Overall great experience we will be back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before. However, I don't usually here about foods that have a healthy menu lol. My friend took me for a girls lunch after SHE left the gym And she wasn't alone after seeing many of the other clientele entering in the workout attire.   The food was really good... We of course tried the skinny(unhappy) side. It was delicuous if I had a personal chef from Skinny fats preparing my healthy meals on a daily I might be in a better place! Lol but the environment is awesome, relaxing with lots of friendly cheerful staff. Even children were in there enjoying juice drinks and the cookies that looked delicious that my friend didn't allow me to have.  So I had the ahi tacos (2) and the summer quench She had the smoke in the bowl and the liquid defense  We were both satisfied!"}
{"text":"Mom and I stopped in for lunch on a Tuesday.  I'd never been before, so the menu was a little overwhelming to me.  Mom had been there before, but she wanted to try something different.  (By the way, she's had the Berry Strong protein waffle and loved it.)  The register cashier was so helpful with his suggestions.  He explained what was on the menu and gave a few ideas for us.    We both ended up ordering one of his choices off the Healthy side menu. I had the Bleu Balsamic.  The portion size was nice, the steak was abundant, and the ingredients were fresh!  Next time, I'd ask for the balsamic on the side, because the vinegar was a bit too overpowering.  Mom had the Avocatoast.  She loved it and finished every bite.  I loved that both meals were under 550 calories and quite filling.  They also have Happy Side meals, which aren't so low in calories and would make anyone comforted!  And included in their menu are vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options.  Parking is close, free and plentiful.  They are in a major strip center, so don't panic if you don't see them from the street.  Just drive along the side and you'll find them.  It's worth it!"}
{"text":"My first time ever at a skinnyfat and I was sold on this being my favorite and I can't wait to go back. I told the guy at the registrar it was my first visit and he was more then happy to explain the menu to my family and make recommendations. Sure enough we ordered 3 of the items he explained and they were amazing. The decor is unique and all the staff extremely friendly and I felt they all cared about the food, guests and their restaurant. I've been in the service industry for years and when the staff shows passion for what their doing it really has an effect on the atmosphere. I'm originally from southern Cali and this place feels like home like it belongs on the beach!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good I got there version of the cheese steak and it was really on point, The wife got the chicken and waffels not so good, I will deffinetly come back to try something else, good vibe good service, down side was only outside seating in the sun was left and portions were a bit small, oh and no regular type soda like coke they have there version of cola that tasted weird to me"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was superb!  They offer vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options. This will be our go-to place everytime we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food here is pretty bomb. Didn't get five stars because they're not too consistent, chicken fingers for example can be soggy at time but delicious more often. Burger temp sometimes off but usually accurate."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I found a really great find nestled near a Vegas strip club. This one happens to be 1 block south of Larry Flint's Hustler Club, but don't let that in any way deter you from trying this fantastic eatery. The name SkinnyFATS translated to various items which are low cal, vegan, non GMO and other items that might not be so much. So in essence, everyone gets covered at this establishment with no compromise on either side.   This place is small, and the time to get your food is about 30 min with line cue, ordering and food wait. But the staff is super friendly, really know the menu and very efficient.  We had the Wake N Bacon  ($9.95) which was bacon, eggs, pepper jack, avocado, & sriracha. Team cheese on a Hawaiian roll served with a side, which we chose the sweet potato fries. A nice breakfast sandwich, easy to eat, and mild in flavor despite the sriiracha and pepper jack.  We also tried the Sweet Cheese Us ($12.95) which was shaved NY strip, pepper marmalade, Carmelized onions, pepper jack, portobello, a cheddar sauce served on a hoagie. We thought the flavor really popped, and the ingredients were spilling out of the sandwich onto our hands the way a real cheesesteak sandwich does.  Pretty diverse menu, with juices and shakes, breakfasts (served all day), salads, tacos, burgers, and bowls bother meat and vegan.  To make it easy for idiots like me, \"healthy\" is served on the left side of the menu, and \"Happy\" is served on the right side of the menu. Calories are listed on the left side but void on the right side!"}
{"text":"We had the Chickenini with avocado and I feel it is one of the best sandwiches in town.  SkinnyFATS pays such great attention to detail on their food. Their food is consistently good. You must try their cookies as well. They are large, soft and they heat them for you before they are served. Thank you chefs!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolute love the concept here.  Be an indulger or keep it light with this yummy Menu that has everything from ahi cucumber boats to patty melts, and evvvverything in between. The juices are yummy too. The only bad thing is the seating!!!!!!! It's so small in here. There are 5 tables in here that you can make singles or duces, Or maybe one 6 top.  Everyone is so crammed. There are maybe 10 or so bar tops along side of the front door. The same pathway that runs along the line of people trying to get in. Its uncomfortable. We don't come here often due to the seating arrangement."}
{"text":"I looooooooooooove the concept of this restaurant but it's a bit pricey for what is served. Portions are great, taste is mostly there, associates are usually always smiling, and it always busy. Like always busy. So busy there is always a line to order food and almost always nowhere to sit. Now, I can't knock a restaurant for being busy but I can did the food quality. I feel for the dollar being spent you could go have a great brunch on the strip, in a casino, at any \"healthy\" food spot. Yes the orange juice is amaze-balls and their truffle fries are some of the best.... but I can say their waffle on the chicken and waffles is one of the worst. I'll continue to come to skinny fats; it's close to my house. And I'm sure I'll continue to be pleasantly surprised or obviously disappointed."}
{"text":"I love that you have the option to build your own juice or smoothie... You can choose up to four ingredients for the standard cup sizes, or add as much as you want (for an additional cost per ingredient). The food is also fantastic."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to take friends to. I've been here a few times and it's delicious every time. I would look old pictures I took of my meal and think \"oh my... me wants now.\" haha.  For first timers you may pass it when you're getting there but it's just a simple U-turn and you're there. So overall, the drive there is easy and it's not on a busy street.  I like going before 11am or after 1:30pm. around 11:30am-1:30pm parking is eh but finding a table inside is no bueno.  Service is always great and although some would feel the price is on the higher side, I think it's worth it. I'm always pleased with my meal and leave with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Something for everyone. Lots of flavor. Spicy where the spice is warranted. Healthy food and not as healthy choices. I wpuld come back"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, got there about 2 seconds after 9pm and although there were people sitting in the restaurant eating or waiting for food I was told too bad, so sad for take out (paraphrasing). Been here before and thought it would be nice of them to offer to fill my order. Maybe I expect too much, but it's  the kind of thing that sours one from returning"}
{"text":"We have been here several times, however, this time we placed an order online and picked it up.  We were told it would be ready at noon.  Showed up at noon and were told we have not gotten to that order yet. Were also told that they would have to charge extra for the Truffle oil, which is fine, however, if you charge someone extra, at least include the item that you charge extra for.   YUP, it was not in the bag...the $3.00 oil was left out.  If this was the only item that was screwed up I would not be wasting my time, however this was the start of the problem.  The Hot Mess we ordered, was literal, it looked like they threw it together as a last resort and we asked for no onions and you guessed it...ONIONS.  The Cherry Popper that was ordered was ordered Medium was clearly Well Done at best and the over easy egg was at least over medium. Granted we will probably be back, but to order online, as we can see the person that looks over these orders does not give a crap about confirming them.  Update. Thank you so much to the great customer service/manager for making this right. Much appreciated."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors in everything I ate  and the decor was super cool. I'm so not cool but being in their environment made me feel cool. Staff was so helpful and friendly. I'll defently be back when I'm on this side of town"}
{"text":"Newly opened in NW. Healthy additon. Anything with tuna was good. You order at the counter and find a tablet.   Music is a little loud, not a first date or conversation place.  Service was great.  Price average.  Food very fresh.  Take some  time to check  out menu online prior to going.... very different as is the  decor. Will be going back soon"}
{"text":"My favorite dish being chicken and waffles, of course I had to try skinny fats. I believe It was spelt chicka-waffa-doppolis?   Let me start by saying the it was perfect! In most chicken and waffles the chickens are chicken tenders and you can just tell. However, I have no idea what skinny fats did to their chicken tenders but it just hits the spot you want it to hit.  Their truffle fries we're okay. It was hard and crunchy so meh. It's still good.   The other thing I got was the shake, I asked the cashier which one was his favorite and he said Nutella, banana and strawberry. I mean just those things together  is good but in a shake, can you say Mhmmm. After awhile the taste for me got old but my friend really liked it. Sooo all good"}
{"text":"Super cool place delicious food. Make sure to get there a little early for lunch it gets busy"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place!! Last night was my second time going and I can't wait to go back again! My favorite right now is the teriyahi sandwich with truffle fries... It's so delicious!!!! My son loved the \"rediculous\" waffle... Comes with fresh berries and is not sweet at all."}
{"text":"Amazing food everyone is nice they have weekly specials. You can eat really healthy or as bad as you'd like their \"right stuffed\" is by far the best thing in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Everything tasted great. I have ordered from this place several times.  It has always been great. You won't be disappointed. Both sides taste great,  skinny or fat side."}
{"text":"Hidden gem, the best sevice and the best food. Never a bad meal. Highly recommend. Dean martin location"}
{"text":"First time at this chain. I was very surprised at how small the dinning area was. They had maybe 8 tables and only a bar area. The bar area did have a view unfortunately it did not over see the Las Vegas strip but it wasn't bad.  I must have came at a busy time because the volume in this place was above average. The music, customers, and the crew talking all at once was a bit much.  Since I have not been here before while I waiting in line they had print out of their menus which made it so convenient for me so I didn't feel rushed when it was my turn to order (no one likes to feel rushed lol)  I loved the fact the had a variety of food here! Especially the shareables on the menu! I wasn't very hungry and was pleased they had that!  I will definitely check this place out again! I'm curious to find out what is the best dish here !  - also the staff here seemed to be very friendly and helpful when other customers were inquiring about the menu!"}
{"text":"Incredibly delisiouse food. It's a bit out of the way if you don't live in vegas but we'll worth the trek."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food! Great selection! I feel good about eating healthy and it doesn't break the bank.   Now if they could make a 24 Hour SkinnyFATS! I would love them even more!"}
{"text":"Not good and nothing hot.  I ordered the Steakation...I got room temp shaved beef on a cold bun.  None of it warmed, grilled or toasted.  I ordered fresh fruit...grapes were geat, all 3 of them.  The rest was cantaloupe, honeydew and watermelon...all soggy with no flavor and far from fresh. They were served in water.  My hubby liked his burger, the spicy one, can't remember.  He ordered truffle fries.  They were a tiny serving and barely warm and not fresh!  I was mad and wanted to take it all back!  We had just driven 6 hrs, were starving and he said forget it,  to the hotel.   $33+ and that's what we got.   I would not return or recommend."}
{"text":"You have two sides of the menu here, the happy side, and the healthy side.  Very unique combinations of ingredients with great flavor.  The atmosphere is nice and the staff is very friendly and checks often to see if you need anything.  I thought the food was good but the milkshakes (I went to happy side) were amazing!"}
{"text":"Good value for money. Good selection. Crispy sweet potato fries. Had the TeriyAhi sandwich. Very good fish. Would like to see better service. Good seating."}
{"text":"Small place but nice not good for a group.  Loved the orange juice. Ordered the soft shell crabs with poached eggs althought the bread was a bit tough but the crab was good."}
{"text":"Originally I left this spot 3 stars. The manager messaged me and invited me back. I took my time doing so as I wanted to go in with a fresh mind and my team of hungry kids. I'm a one-bite wonder. No matter who eats with me, they know I want a bite. :)   This go around I didn't eat all day. I wanted to be hungry, senses keen, taste buds primed. There are two sides to the menu, a healthy side and a happy side. Another reviewer kindly told me to focus on the happy side!   My daughter got the chicken and waffles, my boy got the protein waffle with berries. I got the Thai salad with added ahi tuna.   The salad. It's a good salad. Mango, bacon (real chopped bacon, not bits out of a can) green onions, romaine, peanut dressing...a wonderful bowl of munchies diced to the perfect size. I was satisfied with the quantity.   Chicken and waffles, super. The only drawback, the fried chicken didn't have enough seasoning but they do use excellent maple syrup. It doesn't taste like corn syrup gluttony so one might enjoy the flavor and crispness of the waffle. Same goes with my boy's.   I'm so much happier with this experience than my first. The staff jokes with each other. They like to see who comes in. They want regulars and familiar faces, friends of good food, and the unique Downtown Summerlin experience that means you can get good food at a good price surrounded by kids playing, open air, comfortable seats and tasteful art without a hushed sticky restaurant conveyor belt.   Thanks to the company, and their willingness to take suggestions. I will always refrequent a family vibe that doesn't take itself so seriously they are blindsided by insecure contention."}
{"text":"This place is so cozy and cute and definitely off the beaten path. It's very small inside and there will probably be a wait. The menu is delicious both healthy and happy sides are! I wish it were a bit bigger inside and not so loud -between the location's acoustics and everyone talking way too loud. It was too much. They did however turn it down after I politely asked. Got a strawberry lemonade and the chick-a-waffa-dopplis. Both were tasty. Chicken could've used a little more salt and the lemonade was tad too sweet but otherwise tasty. I love this place because there isn't one thing I don't love on the menu."}
{"text":"I usually go here on the weekends with my daughters for a mommy and me date.  The food is always excellent.  The service is not the best in town but good to say the least.  I would have given 5 stars but the last two times we went the cashier didn't have even change to give me.  Unfortunately I only had a hundred dollar bill and my check was 18$ she tried to give me two 5's and 70 single dollar bills?????, I saw that she had 20's but insisted that she needed them because that's all she had.  Needless to say I'll just be paying with my debit card from now on"}
{"text":"The service was horrible. I called for a take out order and the girl on the phone had a bad attitude and if that wasn't enough I had gotten the wrong order. Terrible service from that girl up at the front"}
{"text":"Thankful we decided to stop here on our road trip! The did was life changing, the service was incredible. Such a fun atmosphere with unique healthy delicious food. Zoie helped us, and went above and beyond. She was so friendly and knowledgeable. I am stopping here everytime we come back thru."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS!!!!!!!!!! Agh! I cant rave about this place enough! I wish they'd open a location in the bay, honestly. I ordered the spicy chicken bowl, can remember what it's called. I ate every last drop. Also had their skinnyFATS punch. I will never forget the flavor of that stuff it was so refreshing and perfect after your first night of a Vegas vacation. Or any morning after in Vegas! Haha really brings you back from the dead. I wish my vacation had been longer so I could have tried more things. It does get REALLY packed in there, but understandably. It's also great cause it helped me not go TOO far off my diet on vacation. I hope these healthy restaurants become the new wave!"}
{"text":"I got the Apollo fries-sweet potato with chicken craisins and cheese. The sweet potato fries were perfectly cooked:crunchy and thin. However the truffle fries that came with the tblt was total opposite-soggy. I wanted to try something on the healthy side but after seeing the portion and what they put in it I think it should've been on the fat side of the menu. The loaded the bowl with sweet potato fries and chicken...delish"}
{"text":"One of my favorite.  Zucchini pasta is amazing. Food looks delicious and tastes really good. Nice staff, clean and tidy.  Own brand of sauces and modern design."}
{"text":"A spacious location with great service and the same great food as the first location.   The dining area offers plenty of seating with both large booths and plenty of bar style seating.  The employees at this location went above and beyond with their service. Every employee was welcoming, friendly, and they were on top of keeping the dining area clean and well stocked. This group should be used as an example of how to offer excellent customer service.   I went with the weekend special that was both creative and delicious. It was a chile relleno benedict with pulled pork and a lime hollandaise sauce. The chile relleno had a crispy breading with plenty of cheese instead. The poached eggs were perfectly prepared and the lime hollandaise was delicious. I loved this special dish. My husband had Steak Eyes and he found it both delicious and filling."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and thought it was awesome both times. This location gets crazy busy and for good reason. Both times I arrived as close to 11 as possible to beat the height of the lunch rush. It was already busy, but I was able to get a table.  The concept really attracted me to this place. I love the idea of being able to get healthy food and splurges in the same spot. So far I've only had splurges, but I plan to dig into the skinny side on my next visit. I also love a spot that serves breakfast all day.  On my most recent visit I had the Cherry Popper. Popping with flavor it was. The 1/2 pound beef patty was juicy and the perfect size for the bun. Banana and cherry peppers made it unique and really added something to the flavor. You can never go wrong with a fried egg that leaks liquid gold all over the burger and bun. As if this combination wasn't already enough they top it with a slaw and pepper jack cheese. It sounds like a lot, but the flavors really work well together.  On my other visit my husband and I split the Chix on Broadway and The Classic. Both were large portions and very tasty. I loved that both were loaded with ingredients and flavor. The truffle fries we opted for on the side were delicious and the truffle wasn't overpowering."}
{"text":"Was looking for something healthy and delicious and this place was awesome! I got it delivered on Postmates and it was still hot and so good when it got here. I had the zucchini noodles and the buffalo cauliflower and O..M....G!! They were soo delicious. I hate cilantro so i just dipped the cauliflower in some greek yogurt and was sooooo happy. Cant wait to order again!"}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly staff. However, the location is tough to get to from any area of town. And, the place is super packed most of the day so it is hard to get in there. Generally, there is a line around the corner on most lunch days, which is a testament to the quality of the food.  What I like the most about this place is their creative use of sauces. Instead of high-calories mayonnaise based sauces, they use homemade yogurt based sauces. This lowers the calorie count by a lot and makes it a much more light meal. Unfortunately, I cannot go to this location very often because of the wait to get in around lunch time.  If they were in a better location and had a larger facility, I would give this five stars for the food and staff."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Something for everybody. Loved the yummus! The staff were all super friendly and helpful. There's not much seating and if you go around noon the line is almost out the door. If your going for lunch go around 11 and you should be fine."}
{"text":"My gf & I wanted the happy side instead of the healthy side but didn't want to overload the calories so we decided to split a classic burger medium rare, orange you happy, & some truffle fries.  Lady was friendly.. She even brought me a cup of water even though it is self-serve.  The burger was pretty big in size. Happy to have split it. It tasted pretty good.  The truffle fries were disappointing.. Very bland/no salt really.  The orange you happy was tasty. The frozen yogurt in it was good along with the juice they put inside. Also, this was a good-sized drink. Splitting was a good choice.  4 out of 5 stars because the truffle fries were just average at best.  Will come back to try the healthy side!"}
{"text":"We really like this place. I've been to the location on Dean Martin once & the one on Warm Springs several times. I wish the location on Warm Springs was larger. It gets pretty crowded & sometimes it's hard to find a seat. The only thing I haven't liked that I ordered was the Naked Chix. I loved the Slow Boat to China & pressed juice I ordered. My family usually orders off the Happy menu & everything has been really good. Last time I went I got sweet potato fries & they were a little undercooked, but tasted pretty good. This is a great place with lots of delicious options on the menu."}
{"text":"Love love this place. Great atmosphere, great customer service. Great healthy options. Will definitely be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment for me. After we ordered, we waited so for our food. My hot mess buffalo bites came out covered in cold toppings, nacho cheese sauce (cold), chicken (cold)...it was gross. Our food came out distinctly separate, 10 minutes.  My balsamic pizza was good, nothing amazing. My co-worker's chicken blt seemed huge and he liked it. He definitely agreed about the hot mess. We both thought our sodas tasted weird. I had diet and he had lemon-lime. I won't be back."}
{"text":"First thought was \"What kind of name is that?\" and then once I saw the menu and the name makes absolute sense - one side of the menu lists the healthy side and the other happy side; aka more fat and calories.  I wasn't feeling that hungry so I ordered one thing from each side - On the fat side I odered the Tu-Nuts which is the spicy ahi tuna with sriracha slaw in a cucumber boat with almonds, avocado aioli. On the skinny side I got the Yummus which is a rosemary hummus with carrots, celery & flatbreads.  Everything was absolutely delicious! So happy to have come here. I wish I had been hungrier so I can try more items on the menu. They need to open up some SkinnyFats in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"I just had the Mean Bean and it is amazing!  I eat a lot of hand made veggie patty's and this one is excellent.  The toppings were fresh and crisp.  The bread was soft and delicious.  I also had the SkinnyFats Punch, AWESOME!  It is refreshing and well balanced.  What was really impressive is that I had this delivered to my hotel.  It took them less the 30 minutes and the food was still hot and the beverage was icy cold.  I don't get to Las Vegas very often but from now on this is my place to grab a quick and healthy bite."}
{"text":"Don't eat here, you will get food poisoning. As soon as I bit into my uncooked chicken, I knew I would get sick. Two hours later, puking for the next 12hours. I have come across two other families that have had the same issue. Called the health department, hope they have made it over by now."}
{"text":"Okay I am SkinnyFats newest fan!! Officially obsessed. Such a unique concept - healthy side & happy (unhealthy) side and such a diverse menu. Everyone can be happy!   Employees were so friendly. Decor is awesome - industrial and funky, totally fun. Easy to drive past at night, not a lot of lights or signage in the industrial park, but somehow makes it feel a little more low key and cool.   I had the flat chicken & greens, plus avocado, per the employees suggestion and it was amazing! My husband had the fried chicken & waffle and really enjoyed it.   Price point is spot on. Food is quality for a great price, portions are perfect.   Hope to make it back this trip, and will definitely come next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I first came to SkinnyFats almost exactly a year ago (their other location) and loved it! Loved the menu and concept and have been hoping I'd get to go again on a future Las Vegas trip.   So when my friends suggested it for dinner, I was stoked. I was glad to come to a second location, to see how it compared. I'm 100% still in. Come to Southern California!!   This time, I got the Caprizza - flat bread pizza with tomatoes, red onion, basil, mozzarella, and grilled chicken, drizzled with a balsamic glaze. It was amazing! Crust was the perfect blend of crispy but not overdone and slightly chewy inside. The ratio of toppings was perfect and it looked so pretty on the plate.   Hoping it isn't another year before I get to go to SkinnyFats again!"}
{"text":"Christian, Tony & team are always great when we come in. They make us feel welcomed and food is GREAT always!"}
{"text":"If compating this to LA standards it's just mediocre. The truffle fries hand no flavor and was just a bit over cooked. The Chicken waffles was over cooked so it was dry. The ahi tuna taco was good, flavors complimented well. I think for local choice it's good but food could really use more tlc."}
{"text":"Cool location. I actually liked that this place is close to the strip, but away from the chaos. It's in a bit of an industrial park.   Inside was very very crowded, but I did overhear one of the waitstaff talking about how they were expanding (maybe he was talking about something else...). It was a bit hard to order and not be on top of someone that was eating. It was just very cramped.   We ordered a green smoothie and breakfast burrito. Now, I know a green smoothie is a big of a gamble...but, it tasted horrible - mostly like grass clippings. Maybe they could try adding some agave to take some of the edge off. The breakfast burrito was amazing though and a huge portion. It was probably one of the better burritos I've had! Good job on that guys.   I'll need to revisit this place for any more stars."}
{"text":"Skinnyfats has a knack for making healthy food taste so good and less healthy food, even better!  This location just opened on Black Friday and as always, they're a hot commodity in any neighborhood they're in. For a Tuesday evening, the dinner rush wasn't bad.. by the time we finished eating, the dining room was 1/2 full.   Remember they have food the menu \"secret\" items-- namely the HappyMess-- their take on carne asada fries. My go to is their NakedChix  or their AhiTuna anything.  Smoothies are also so good! They have a patio which, I think, is dog friendly.. since the mall is dog friendly???  The patio at their Warm Springs location isn't dog friendly. I really hope this one is. Come to this location instead!  Food came out quick and fresh! Plenty of seating compared to other locations. I imagine on the weekends it's more packed so expect a brief wait at the very least.  Hooray for more casual/quick/healthy food options in DT Summerlin!"}
{"text":"Uhm Yum.....  I come here frequently for lunch so I'm surprised I have not yet reviewed this place.  Everything is good. I personally enjoy their Chicken Salad, their Happymess Fries, and today, the Ahi Tuna Sandwich.. sorry I don't recall all their cute names.  Their juices and smoothies are delish too-- recommend the Cucumber Strawberry smoothie for a hot day.  Seating is first come first serve. But please, don't save seats if you haven't ordered yet. I guarantee that a seat will be available for you once you're ready to eat since that's how the system of turnover seems to work. Plus there are communal tables and an outside patio that you can resort to.  Parking sucks. I park by CVS and just walk over.  There's also a location on Dean Martin by the strip. That place is tinier than this with less parking. Also, it's frequented more by tourists."}
{"text":"I love this place! I eat at one of their locations every time I come to Las Vegas, and this new location is my favorite. I enjoyed the friendly, helpful service and recommendations from the employees. They have an excellent craft beer selection and creative food options for every preference (super healthy or indulgent happy). They even offer their own cold-pressed juices. I sat at the bar in front of the large TVs with live sports, but might enjoy the comfy outdoor patio next time."}
{"text":"Insanely good! Like INSANELY. Generally when you order a healthy dish--- it tastes flavorless. Not this place! Just the right combo of favors and freshness!!! I ordered the Zoodles and Ahi Cucumber boat & it is my new favorite lunch! I'll be back... Probably tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"Love the menu love the option of choosing a variety of shakes and food. Great location although i wish parking lot was bigger as its tough to get a spot when place is busy.. message here... go early!!"}
{"text":"In town visiting and wanted to stop for lunch off the strip and I can say this place did not disappoint! A lot of reviews mention the small space, and they were right. It was a packed house with a line out The door. But the service is quick so the tables seemed to turn over quickly so people in line didn't seem to wait too long. The mad veggie burger was amazing, the spicy hummus is super flavorful. I had it with a side of fruit and that complimented it very well! My boyfriend had the turkey bacon sandwich and loved it also. Would definitely come back when we're here!"}
{"text":"They really have a great variety of healthy and items to indulge. I have the breakfast burrito (super burrito I think the name was) it was stuffed with egg whites, spinach, chicken and mushrooms, topped with pico. It was very filled and didn't contain a lot of calories.    As great as my burrito was, I was jealous of my honeys avocado toast! It was amazing! It was toast topped with guacamole, pesto, feta and an egg.   This visit was really good, I can only give 4 stars right now because my previous visit was the complete opposite.  Definitely going to give it another try though!"}
{"text":"Skinny Fats is my dichotomy of wanting good, healthy food but not wanting to miss out on the bad stuff that's soo good. I definitely came late to this party, but better late than never. The only reason I've ever come down this part of Dean Martin is to look for tile & flooring or show Panorama Towers. Now it's to come to Skinny Fats for their Chicken & Waffles...listed only on their \"Secret Menu\" that you can access online. The food is good enough that you won't mind getting into near fights or at least shooting dirty looks at patrons who tend to push chairs back into you due to the seating area being so cramped. You've already read how the menu works from other reviews. Basically good side and evil side...aka healthy and happy sides. Ordered tonight was the more cow bowl (happy side) which looked good and had nice pieces of tender beef. The slob cob was good but the ranch dressing is the best part. Truffle fries were ok. Cool mame (ranch edamame) was different and nice. Best part was the Chicken & Waffle. Wow! All white meat perfectly breaded and seasoned atop a waffle doused in syrup. Even my wife who does not normally like fried chicken (I know, what's wrong with her right?), couldn't keep her fork off my chicken & waffles. She needs to get her own next time! I Instagramed the pic and now everyone wants it. It's near midnight and I'm going to bed now with images of this dish. Good night and see you soon SF!"}
{"text":"Packed but worth the wait. USB outlets on the bar. Healthy and happy. Apple pancakes and steak Benedict both delicious!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at SkinnyFATS. I had always heard about it from others but never got the chance to eat here until last night with friends. We arrived at about 10 pm (1 hour before closing) but it was still getting a regular influx of customers.  I walked in and was greeted by friendly waitresses. You order at the front from either the healthy or happy (aka unhealthy) side, or maybe from both. Then you take a seat with your number and wait for your food to be delivered. We opted to eat at the patio since there was more privacy and heat lamps were present to keep us warm.  They also have alcohol available if you want. If you're a penny-pincher like me, then most likely you'll opt for the free cucumber water.  I got the Chicks on Broadway from the happy menu. It was a deep fried chicken breast with bacon and a green tomato along with some other garnishings. It came with a side of truffle fries.  At the patio table we were at, there was the very necessary napkin dispenser with a variety of sauces, including regular & jalapeno ketchup and chalula.  The food, decor, and experience were all very good and I had a pleasant experience here. The only reason that I can't give this place 5 stars is the prices. They're pretty high. My order cost $10, closer to $11 with tax. Despite this, I'll still be back. My visits just won't be as frequent as cheaper places."}
{"text":"I got a SkinnyFATS gift card for Christmas and finally we a few months ago. Holy cow this place is epic. Between their homemade cola, delicious jalapeno ketchup, and just plain awesome food it's easily my new favorite place to eat. Unfortunately they are all the was across town since I live in the North West, but I hear we can expect one at Decatur and 215. Can't wait! Their weekend Benedict's are to die for."}
{"text":"Good food and i was real impressed with angelica she was attentive and kind. They are a friendly staff with cool food. I will return for more goodies and the cookies are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Would seriously eat anything and everything on the menu! We had the S'motherload burrito and the ScramBowl, both were so amazing"}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots when I have company in town. The atmosphere is Hip the food is always good and the staff is friendly and service is fast. My favorite side dish is Balls 2.0. And they have great salads (but not so skinny) meaning hearty servings and Fat toppings. Yum."}
{"text":"This place is really great! The staff is really nice,polite and helpful. The fountain drinks are some of the best I've ever had, sweetened with cane sugar. The food is the definition of fresh. The wifey and I shared a Pimp Shrimp, Slow Boat to China, Sweet potato fries (which pair excellent with the house jalapeno ketchup), Adobe Hobo & Seared Ahi tacos.My only complaint is I didn't have room for more of this delicious food."}
{"text":"I took some NYC food snobs here and they were convinced that nothing in Vegas could compare to what they had back home.  They were convinced otherwise. Great food, great concept (happy vs healthy), great atmosphere (much bigger than the Dean Martin location), and great production value.  The ordering process takes longer than it should but that is because people in line can't make up their mind on what to get."}
{"text":"I had brunch here today due to a friend recommending it, and of course after seeing the reviews on Yelp!  I must say that I was pleased with the food and service here!  I like the array of food and drink choices!  They also have a secret menu that has more deliciousness if you care to indulge!  I had the Bonjour brûlée and I was pleased with the French toast!  It was accompanied by turkey bacon, that may have been delish but I wouldn't know because it wasn't cooked well enough so I just opted to not even eat it!  I also had a chai tea that was great, nothing too special there!    The downside that I see is that the restaurant is soo small, and maybe understaffed.  As I was leaving I wanted to try one of their create your own Juice/shakes but the line was literally out the door!  People were waiting for seats!  The second we got up from out table, there was already another party sitting down and the table hadn't even been cleaned yet(it wasn't dirty by far, pretty much just dishes).  However, they do offer online ordering, so more then likely I will utilize that option and not even chance not having a place to sit!  Overall, great concept, great food, great customer service!  I will return!      Also, one last thing I would like to recommend is including the calorie count on the menu for at least the healthy options!  I know I would like that....not a deal breaker though!"}
{"text":"Pretty unique stuff. I'd pass on the truffle fries but the sweet potato fries are good"}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is tucked off the Strip in an industrial setting, but the inside and outside of the restaurant has been redesigned to have its own unique (and cute!) feel. There's a cheery banner outside and the inside is covered in wood and painted with produce - it's a bit cramped once you're in, but it works. I've only been once, so I'm not sure how crowded or how long a wait might be during busy times.  I had the Juan Healthy Wrap, which was jam-packed with protein and HUGE. It got a little soggy, probably from the pico de gallo, but it was still tasty. My boyfriend got the Drunken Monkey Cakes, and our friends got the apollo fries and the Slow Boat to China. All of our food was good, and it came out pretty quickly. Everything was pretty reasonably priced, too.  Why three stars? I didn't see much on the menu that makes me want to go back and eat there again. I had two of the three things I wanted to try when I was there, and while it was good, I didn't have a hard choice of picking between all my options. I seem to be the only person among my friends who feels this way, though, so maybe it's just me. I'd def. recommend trying SkinnyFats, though!"}
{"text":"The Pountine Benny was amazing . The service was fantastic and very quick. An adorable restaurant. The ambience and art is fun and quirky. Shoutout to Meagan, thanks for a wonderful lunch!!"}
{"text":"Friday Morning - got my usual breakfast sammy (chipper morning - never disappoints!) Friday night - picked up a ton of good eats for the weekend (half my check goes to this place I swear!) & even though my order was pretty jacked up & some of the staff can be a little rude at times- everything was still delicious!"}
{"text":"I love their healthy and unhealthy options! I continually visit this place because of its simplicity and menu variety. I bring here many friends and no matter what their food preference, they always leave this place satisfied. A must visit if you are in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Slow boat to china is my fav."}
{"text":"The food at this place was great. The worst part about the menu was that there were too many good things to choose from. What I got tasted great!  The only reason it doesn't get four stars is because the space is kind of cramped and they were out of my first pick.   I'll be back for more next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Everything on the menu is absolutely amazingly delicious. When I have family members from out-of-town, I always take them to SkinnyFats and they always wants to go back everyday they are here visiting. If there was more than five stars I would give them more. This is more than a five-star restaurant because it's the playground for people who are watching calories and for those who just want to be happy and not watch any calories. This place is absolutely amazingly scrumptiously delicious"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. They have a healthy menu and also have a not so healthy(happymenu). The service was great and the staff were friendly. The sitting situation was a bit difficult only because it kinda small inside. Love this place and will be stopping here every time I head to Vegas"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from too many people and wanting to go for so long, I finally got a taste of SkinnyFATS.   It's a small quick service restaurant located on Dean Martin where you wouldn't exactly expect to find a restaurant. Inside there's a few tables and bar top seating against the the walls. You order and pay at the counter and the workers bring the food out to you as soon as it's ready.  The menu has a unique concept that matches the name perfectly; \"skinny\" (healthier) items and \"happy\" (delicious, fatty, the last thing you should consider eating on a diet) items. The menu is also very diverse, including a variety of breakfast items and lunch entrees ranging from seared ahi tacos, turkey stuffed peppers, tofu fried rice, to a classic cheeseburger.   I asked the young lady working the counter what she recommended on the skinny side and she said her favorite was Smoke in a Bowl, a dish with BBQ chicken. She asked if I liked spicy food (which of course I said yes to) and she strongly recommended the CauliFIRE, which is cauliflower tossed in hot buffalo sauce and topped with garlic and pico de gallo. I went with the second recommendation and added grilled chicken for some protein. I also had to try one of their juices so I got the Liquid Defense (orange, lemon, lime, apple, carrot juice) which I was a big fan of. My friend went with his go-to chicken and waffles.  The food came out within 10-15 minutes and I enjoyed my dish! It was very simple yet satisfying. Cooked cauliflower and strips of grilled chicken tossed in their spicy buffalo sauce. Came with celery, carrots, and fat free ranch too. It was definitely good, but not anything that blew away my taste buds. I did order from the skinny side so I have to take that into consideration...  My visit to SkinnyFATS was long overdue and I'm glad I went. Friendly workers and a fun menu concept. I get why people like this place. I will definitely have to come back and explore a few of their \"happy\" menu items next time!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend SkinnyFats! This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Their clever concept of having both a \"skinny menu\" for those calorie counters out there & a \"happy menu\" for those who just want a yummy meal ensures there's something tasty for everyone. My favorite breakfast item is the \"wake and bacon,\" a delicious breakfast sandwich with an egg frittata, avocado, cheese, and sriracha cream cheese on a sweet Hawaiian bun. This is a must try on the \"happy\" side of the menu. I've had nearly every item on both sides of the menu and haven't been disappointed once.   In addition to having amazing food, the customer service is outstanding. All of the employees are warm, welcoming, and polite; customers are greeted when the arrive and as they're leaving. While all of the employees are friendly, Jennifer stands out! She always goes out of her way to make me feel important.  Give SkinnyFats a try & you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Awesome food in a quirky cool environment and the staff iced the cake. Thanks to all, we will be back soon"}
{"text":"We come here all the time. We're always treated great, some employees even remember us. Employees are super upbeat & friendly. Food is delicious - dine in or take out. Environment is very original and cool as well."}
{"text":"Employees are so friendly and upbeat. Environment is very authentic and cool. Food is amazing."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I did not review SkinnyFats the first time I ate here, but apparently I did not. I'm guessing I must have been reserving my rating for another try. I've now been here a total of... twice.  On my first run at this place I probably would have given 4-stars, but I'll say my rating is more like a 3, but bordering on 4, if they fix a few issues.  First off the place is small, too small for the amount of traffic it gets. I realize they can't do anything about this, but still. Secondly, I waited for my food FOR-E-VER the last time I was here. Eh, I know these can be day-to-day issues, I'm not docking them for it, it's just me being a whiny patron.  Here's the real deal - I ordered a Cranburkey with a side salad. The salad came out with the ranch cup tipped all over my salad. Presentation not so great. Salad - good. Next came the Cranburkey. Presentation - terrible. I'm used to following SkinnyFats on Instagram and their pictures of their food looks SO GOOD, and so nicely plated. So, I was disappointed. I thought, the taste will make up for it!  The Cranburkey had a dry bun. The turkey was cooked well enough - but kind of bland. The cranberry-type gravy was all right, but not enough to have me desiring it again. The arugula-mix on the burger was wilted, and not terribly fresh. I picked a bunch of it out. Overall - an OK meal, therefore my rating is \"A-OK\".   Not sure I'll be back. It's kind of out of the way from where I live and where I work. We'll see."}
{"text":"Always so fresh! A must stop when in Vegas!liked this location since it's alot larger . We will be back!"}
{"text":"Goodness I love this place! The wakin Bacon and the smotherlode are amazing! The service is always great too! If you go right at opening it may take a little longer to get your food but the food will always be fresh and amazing!  My favorite is that they have a healthy version of breakfast too! The caulifire is great as well! You can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place recently, it's a bit hidden so look for the billboard... its small and cute but way better than I expected... they have a skinny menu and fat menu. I ordered off the skinny one only cause doctors orders but I was surprised it was delightful and scrumptious... my friend also ordered skinny and she was satisfied as well... I am pretty eager to try the fat side..."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants! So the basic premise is you have the \"skinny\" menu (aka healthy) and the \"fat\" menu (aka happy). The stuff on my side of the menu (fat) is so darn good, I can never bring myself to try the \"skinny\" side! Fortunately I have a skinny, health conscious wife who tends to prefer that side of the menu, which has given me opportunity to sample those items and I have to say, not bad. Actually good. Actually really good! But it still doesn't stop me from ordering from the fat side. The Meltdown is fantastic, as is the Cherry Popper, as is the Buff Chix, as is the Chickawafadopolis (chicken and waffles). As you can see I keep wandering all over the menu every time I go there because I have yet to try anything that isn't amazing! The only thing I consistently get nearly every time is the Frickles (fried pickles), because they're amazing and I'm a sucker for fried pickles."}
{"text":"The places overall concept, and atmosphere is great! Now the execution on the other hand is another story...     ORDER   Happy fries - first round came out cold and soggy, but the second time was better  Naked Chix - uh lots of food but that's about it.. Dressing was subpar as well as the chewy chicken.  Hangover Juice - it was great, but was it pre made?  The staff - was AWESOME, kind, and accommodating to our food restrictions as well!!"}
{"text":"Had the classic burger, wife had the chicken on Broadway sandwich. Awesome! Awesome awesome. Fun and cozy little spot. Great atmosphere. Very friendly staff! Highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"As a born and raised Portland foodie, I hold a high standard to food and delivery. SkinnyFATS was right there with my long missed Portland food. We ordered the chicken and waffles, french toast and the rediculous. All were great! Only tip, with the red velvet waffle, don't get it extra crispy as it is already crispy. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The menu is extensive. There's the healthy side and the happy side. Happy side is basically the unhealthy side but the delicious side. My cousins and I all order from the happy side and we were thoroughly content. Everything is made fresh. Portions are generous, so you get good value. I ordered the bbq cauliflower and was very unimpressed. It was not good. The vegetable was not fully cooked. I'd stay away from that particular dish. I was told it's very popular and I honestly cannot see why. They should've chosen another vegetable as the bbq sauce dripped from it like it was water. Over all, very happy. seating is limited, so best to go in smaller groups or solo. Oh, I had their peanut butter cookie and that was fantastic."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas and needed a good brunch/breakfast spot. Found Skinny Fats on yelp and decided to give it a try. We ordered the Shrimp Pimp Boat,  Chicken & Waffles, and Protein Berry Waffle with turkey bacon. We were VERY pleased with our meal. Looking around at other's food we were a little apprehensive but we were very please with our portion sizes and food."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Great atmosphere, delicious beverages, and food far beyond expectation. I got the Filet o' Fire with truffle fries and it was definitely something I'd come back for."}
{"text":"Awesome find during trip to LV. Food is tasty and customer service is great! It's a small location but turns around really quickly. We didn't wait long... you're also not rushed. Don't know how they do it but they do. Soda is a natural brand so don't expect it to be popular commercial brand. It tasted good. My husband drinks Diet Coke and enjoyed it !"}
{"text":"Great menu selection. They have a heathy & happy menu.   4 of us split the following- red velvet waffles/chocolate, raspberries, & cream cheese icing, #Merica - chicken fried strip steak & gravy on top of biscuits w/3 eggs scrambled, Ahi Taco-San , the special New York Bleu shaved strip steak sandwich  Great atmosphere, friendly staff. Excited to talk & recommend items.  It has about 50-60 seats. Very busy at 11am.   It's about 5-10 minutes from strip.   If your a foodie for sure try them out.  Prices range about $8-$12. Good portions."}
{"text":"The line was constantly long but it only took us about 10 minutes before we got to the front of the line. The girls at the front counter/cashier were very friendly and sweet! We sat at a booth that perfectly sat our party of 5. They made a mistake on one of our orders but ALANA was very nice and accommodating! Food was alright. Drinks were great! Customer service overall was great!! Lemon bar dessert was reeeeally good! Keep it! We'll be back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Overall delicious food , drinks , ambiance , customer service !  Although my food + drinks weren't properly made for pictures. :( Not cool enough to post!"}
{"text":"The best place in town to go with all your friends because they seriously have options for everyone.  The concept is exactly what you would guess from the name - happy food and healthy food.  The service is outstanding and the staff seems to take extreme pride in their job.  I like the new location a little more due to the size and the patio is pretty cool.    I've eaten at both countless times and have enjoyed choices on both the happy and healthy menu.."}
{"text":"I've only been to this place twice. Both times have been excellent. I would suggest you try the Apollo Fries they're very good with excellent flavor. Sometimes the services can be lagging nothing too terrible tho, but it's understandable because that place can get extremely busy. It's also pretty small so large parties would not be a good idea. Prices are decent not too much more or less than any other sit down restaurant. I've never really had favorite eat spot. This is now it. You can see their menu items thru their Instagram @eatskinnyfats . Check them out."}
{"text":"It's gratifying to know that some restaurant owners or managers really are listening - or reading!  We decided to brave the loud music and the AC in frigid January and return to SkinnyFATS. They must have known we were coming - the music was at conversational levels and the temp was just right!  Miles, the guy at the register, is super helpful and patient, and very friendly, too. I was glad to see that they now have wine, but IMHO, they are priced too high for the venue. I mentioned this to Reed, a manager (owner?) who was seated at a counter near us, and he explained that they were in the exploration stage of their wines, and he appreciated my comment.  In keeping with the outside temps, the hubs had a craving for soup, and ordered the tomato soup. Miles had said it was different, and it sure was: not your usual cream of tomato, this one was rich and dark without cream, a bit spicy, with toasted bread croutons, and thoroughly delicious.   We couldn't resist ordering the same salad we had last time, which was the shining star of that meal - the Thai Cobb, again with turkey bacon and peanut dressing on the side. As it was brought to the table, the runner noticed that the dressing was on the salad, and whisked it away before even putting it down. Reed was still nearby and overheard; he said they were just going to throw it out, so we should keep it. My husband would surely eat it, dressing and all, so we ended up with two of those fabulous salads. Now that's service!  Also to share was the Sweet Cheese Us - shaved NY strip, with pepper marmalade, caramelized onions, pepper jack, and portobello on a hoagie. We got the cheddar sauce separately and this time had the riced cauliflower as our side. My husband found that a bit too garlicky, but I loved it, though I would prefer my cauliflower cooked some more. But when my fork, which had been dipped into the cheddar sauce, hit that cauliflower, wow, what a flavor sensation! I have resigned myself to the fact that I'm never gonna find a hoagie roll in Vegas that has a hard, crunchy outside, so I don't even take that into consideration any more. It was a great sandwich despite that.  We've done a total 180 on SkinnyFATS, and understand now why the reviews are so great!!"}
{"text":"I went on a Friday evening and I must say this restaurant has a good, friendly, vibe. The menu also has vegetarian options, which is great for me. The only issue was seating, as it was quite busy during dinner time, but it all worked out. One of the young ladies actually helped me move my food to a larger table when it became available (we initially fit 4 people at a table for 2).   Now to the food. I ordered a Vegwich with sweet potato fries and it was delicious! I absolutely loved the 9 grain toasted bread. The mushrooms were cooked perfectly and my stomach was completely happy after that. The only bad thing is I did not notice the scrumptious looking cookies in the display case until after I had already ordered and paid. At the conclusion of my meal, the sugar cookie beckoned and I responded appropriately. If you order a cookie, definitely take them up on the offer to heat it. I ordered the sugar cookie and it was delicious!   SkinnyFats is definitely a place you should check out."}
{"text":"Woop woop called in my breakfast got it super fast. Love this place!!! You guys rock! I can see why your place is always packed!!! Holla!"}
{"text":"Updated review: Still love this place for the food, but the seating is constantly stressful. I've come here many different times of the day on many different days throughout the week, and it's always a problem. Weekends are not the only time, it's all the time, unfortunately. They have limited seating to begin with, and since the place is popular, it's always busy.  Very good food, again. But, I do have to be honest in saying that there have been multiple times I have opted not to come here and have gone somewhere else because I didn't want the headache of not finding a seat. Often times when you do, you're forced to sit at a table that still needs to be bussed, or if it has been bussed, goes without being wiped off.   They're just too busy to accommodate the demand both in seating and with staff help."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot! I always get the Happymess fries that are seriously addicting! As my meal I get the Berry the Steak...every time haha. Its always super crowded so try and snag a table (sometimes impossible) and be prepared to wait a little while. IT IS WORTH THE WAIT! Everything comes plated beautifully and looks just like the menu photos. Such a great spot to eat!!"}
{"text":"I went there with my 3 1/2 yr old today, we drove in from downtown and it was worth it. Ambiance is awesome, vibrant colors, clean and a fantastic and fun menu.  We ordered the Slow Boat to China, which is a snack, of Asian chicken salad on a cucumber boat-fresh, delicious and filling! We also had the Waffle Mountain High since they serve breakfast all day (winning). Again, fresh and delicious.  Also tried the Mrs. Green smoothie and the Nutty Nana Flat. Everything is fresh and fantastic.  We can't wait to go back and try more menu items we couldn't consume today (they even have a challenge to try everything on the menu and receive 10% off for life)  Next time we bring the hubs and try the Ahi Sirachi tacos and the Meaty Buns and everything else for that matter......  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Skinny Fats is located in a industrial building so you may drive right past it if you go too fast! ! It was busy when we went so it goes to show if there is good food somewhere it doesn't  matter where you are located people will find you.   The dining area is a bit tight so I'm glad we found a seat. I suggested  this place to my husband  because  he is constantly blaming me that him putting on the pounds is all my fault because  we eat out too much! lol The beauty of this place is there is a healthy side of the menu and there is a fatty side. He can eat a salad while I eat hungry man style!! I ordered  the The Classic Burger which is a 1/2 beef patty, cheddar cheese, tomato,  onion, pickle and lettuce with fries. I had it medium well and it was cooked perfectly!  My husband still had a bite of mine though! We also shared a strawberry shake. You also get to take the recyclable cups with you . Since they are plastic  you can get more than one use out of them. The food is wonderful  no matter if you are in for a cheat day or want to stay within your diet!"}
{"text":"Been here several times and this time they were disorganized.  It's a small place so it's hard to stand in line or find a spot to sit.  Water containers were out, people were asking for things and the cashier wasn't too happy to assist.  Several dirty tables which could've helped alleviate the issue of people standing everywhere.  The food was good but not great and for the cost, we were disappointed."}
{"text":"GO HERE!!  First the location is a bit...out of the way. They mentioned a 2nd location opening soon at Decatur & Warm Springs. Parking was OK. We went around 1230pm on a Sunday and it was jam packed. Seating is super limited...people will hover to get your table when your are nearing completion of your meal.  It was very clean. Even though the tables turn over at lightning speed, the staff was on top of wiping them down. I, also, noticed things like a customer a few tables over dropped his silverware & without skipping a beat, a staff member brought a replacement. Also, a different staff member saw a straw wrapper on the floor and picked it up on her way to do something else. My husband works in the restaurant industry, so I've been trained to notice these things.  Service was super friendly and helpful.  You order at the counter, TRY to find a seat, and they give you a number to put on your table for someone to deliver to you. They know they menu really well so they can answer questions, offer suggestions, or make substitutions.  Also, even though we didn't notice our food took a while...the guy who brought the food or to us, apologized & gave up a free cookie!!  I had the Bleu Balsamic which for some reason I thought was a sandwich, but s actually a salad. It was AMAZING. It includes shaved beef, which many places fail at and it can be tough and rubbery. Not here!! It literally melts in your mouth!! My husband had a Sweet Cheese Us without the portobello & truffle oil. With 2 drinks, it came to about $20. The cookies are big and baked to perfection. The chocolate was high quality too...the chocolate chips just tasted chocolate-ier than what you expect. In fact, everything we had was really fresh & you could tell.  I would absolutely go back here, there are so many menu items I want to try, especially the Sunday Sundae. I cannot wait for the next location to open!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The food is fresh and delicious, so much so I went there two days in a row for lunch.  Day one I got the cranturkey burger and a side salad.  The turkey burger was very good and juicy, the wheat bun was fresh and the cranberry sauce made it wonderful.  Day two I got the avocado toast, it's REALLY good, super duper good.   My only complaint would be the time it took me to get my food on day  40 minutes....I felt like they needed to be sorrier about it, maybe offer up a free cookie or have someone come by and apologize for the time.  No biggie tho, it was more delicious than annoying.   And the next day after this review.... this wonderful place contacted me with a sweet note and gift card. I  love them."}
{"text":"This lovely hole-in-the-wall restaurant is the perfect place to find healthy meal alternatives and experience a very friendly staff service. The foods are very unique, each with their own deliciousness and the portion sizes are perfect. I can easily go here without worrying about trying something new because everything they have is great."}
{"text":"Good food, skinny or fat whichever you prefer. This time I had the happy (fat) menu and was very happy! I will make this a regular stop in Vegas!"}
{"text":"delicious! First time here and not dissapointed yumm! i will def recommend this place to eveyone ."}
{"text":"This place is worthy of all FIVE stars. Just imagine a restaurant where you have both an \"Indulgent\" (AKA Fat menu) and a Healthy menu; it will please any and everyone in your party. I had no idea what to order when our friend took us here but the cashier was super friendly and helpful and had a few recommendations. She also let us try some sort of slushy drink as well which was nice of her.   I ended up ordering the \"Avocatoast\" which is essentially Avocado toast because I am a basic millenial trying to be healthy. Even though this was a very simple dish, it was one of the best I had during our trip to vegas. The avocado toast was delicious: it was piled high with guacamole on a perfectly toasted toast and topped with feta cheese and a fried egg. It was also surprisingly filling and didn't make me feel overly stuffed.   They have all day breakfast which is a bonus. They have everything on this menu from chicken and waffles to burritos to tacos and soups and they pretty much have the \"indulgent\" and healthy version of every dish.   What's pretty cool is that they have a raw juice bar connected to their restaurant! What is pretty cool is that you can either order one of their drink combos or customize your own! I don't remember what I got but I remember it was refreshing. The staff here is super friendly and I would go back here the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Great and healthy restaurant. Its relatively inexpensive compared to your greens and proteins. It also has a hip, cool, and laid back ambiance. I would recommend going here to eat."}
{"text":"Great tasteful healthy food. This place is awesome and always such a hard time to pic of the menu! This time we got a bowl, smoke in a bowl with jasmine rice and naked chix with cauliflower rice.  Five stars because the smoke in the bowl had amazing flavor, it was similar taste to provencale sauce and nice tender chicken. The naked chix was very similar but milder and had plenty of chicken but the cauliflower rice.   We have breakfast here about twice a week as we love this place and are excited they are opening more establishments around town. We also really like a lot of the sharing menu such as the cucumber boats and we love the breakfast burritos  they are killer yummmm"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Came here on a recommendation... And was thoroughly happy about it! The lady and I shared the chicken and waffles, the NY strip with tomato goat cheese and balsamic glaze and some sweet tatter fries. Waffle cooked perfect, steak was THIN cut and the goat cheese and balsamic was tasty! Can't wait to eat more off this menu..."}
{"text":"The food here is always fresh and delicious. Expect to stand in line for about 10 min and find a table in the small establishment.   We typically order at least one new item every time we go. This time it was the fried pickles! Let's just say they are the best we've ever had and we've been traveling and trying fried pickles everywhere we go! I know healthy right!  We also orders the all time favorite Filet-O-Fire and the Steakation, both are wonderful. Steak is tender and accompaniments are fresh.  Also they have a secret menu, on it they have a smoothie that is delicious. Please be sure to ask about it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Skinny Fats provides a pretty decent menu with foods I never thought would taste good together! I have ordered many items on their menu and I was never disappointed with any of them. My favorite is the tu-nuts dish.   Another reason why I rate these guys 5-stars is because of the customer service. People on here complain about little things but in my eyes I feel customer service is a must. I ordered smoke in a bowl once and they ran out of rice, bummer. They told me I could order whatever I wanted in place of it. Not only did they give me the smoke in a bowl without the brown rice & the second dish I ordered, but they comped my whole meal! Love the respect. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"I have been to a couple of other SkinnyFATS locations, and this location is right up there with the others as far as quality of service and quality of food. I had the Blaze of Thunder Chicken Sandwich from the 'Happy Side\" of the menu.  It is a crispy nashville hot chicken sandwich with cold slaw, pickles, and on a brioche bun. My only complaint was that it was a little to crispy... but crispy is in the description so that isn't the worst thing ever. The sandwich is served with a side, I chose fries. They asked if I wanted seasoned or plain. I said plain, and that is exactly what I got. Salt and Pepper is on the table, but I do like my fries salted when they are freshly cooked.  So many things on the menu to try.... one day I will have to try something from the \"Healthy Side\""}
{"text":"I ordered from the 'breakfast all day'  \"happy\" menu. I had the Wake N Bacon Sandwich. It is Bacon, Egg Frittata, Pepper Jack Cheese, Avocado, Sriracha Cream Cheese on a Hawaiian Roll, and comes with Country Potatoes.  The sandwich was delicious, lots of applewood smoked bacon cooked nice and crispy. I was a little worried about the Sriracha Cream Cheese, but it was a great flavor combination when put together with the other ingredients.  The potatoes were a bit dry, but I added some of their 'Pepper Catchup' that was on the table and it helped them out a lot. They have quite an extensive menu for both \"healthy\" and \"happy\" eating. I will definitely be back to try some lunch options."}
{"text":"My husband had the chicken and waffles, crispy fried chicken tenders on a thick buttermilk waffle. He liked them very much! I had the breakfast burrito, I can't remember the name they have for it, but we both ordered from the \"happy\" menu. My burrito was very good, thin cut pieces of steak, baby potatoes, eggs, onions, peppers wrapped in a soft flour tortilla and topped with a cheddar cheese sauce and pico...... Yummy!!! I am anxious to go back and try some other dishes I saw that looked great."}
{"text":"I went here about a week ago with my grandmother. She's pretty picky and has a lot of food intolerances. But she was able to find something she liked on the menu. She chose the chicken and waffles. I like that you have the choice of the healthy side or the happy side. I like a place that can accommodate different tastes and styles of eating. I truly do like the happy food but really should be eating the healthy food. So I'm glad that my grandmother was able to get something from the happy side while I dined only from the healthy side. We ordered way too much. I ordered the two tacos: the Ahi tuna and the steak taco on the healthy side. I also ordered a kids size whole wheat pancake as a dessert. The tacos were about seven dollars and the large kid's sized pancake was only four dollars. My grandmother had the chicken and waffles and was also craving some sweet potato fries. I think the entire meal was $35 total. It was well worth it and there was a lot of extra food. I have never seen my grandmother eat so much. She ate the entire chicken and waffles. It came with four chicken tender strips and a large waffle. She loved it! My tacos were just OK. The meat taco was really good, kind of had a Mediterranean flavor to it. That he taco was bland and kind of boring. I probably wouldn't order it again. The four dollar pancake was a steel  (see picture). It is large and filling and enough for one adult person. The sweet potato fries were tasty, crisp, and hot. I tried a bite of my grandmother's chicken and waffles and thought it was very good too. All in all a great Monday afternoon lunch with my grandmother. She can't wait to go back there again and I would love to try it again as well. I wish they had places like this in Houston!"}
{"text":"I can't think of a reason to give this less than 5 stars. Good service, good food for healthy or not-so-healthy options on a 2-sided menu  that explains it easily.  It's small and it was crowded but we got a table for two after we ordered at the register. There was always a line. If they brought this to my hometown I would definitely go!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the coffee, the blueberry French toast and my immunity drink.....all delicious. Thanks.  Well worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Wow! I just had \"Berry the Steak\" and it was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  The Flatbread was perfect,  the steak was tender and delicious,  and then adding goat cheese,  arugula,  and balsamic glaze!  It was perfect! The worst part of the meal was trying to narrow the choices down to just one.  Everything sounded so good."}
{"text":"Truly the best dining experience we have had in awhile.  We came in with a large party for our daughter's 14th  birthday because she loves their giant grilled chicken sandwiches.  The environment is cool feeling and comforting.  Clean with colorful murals and nice seating.  The staff is friendly, patient and attentive.  It was very busy but they managed to scoot some tables together.   Such lovely people working there...We even accidentally ordered the wrong thing for our son and they just replaced it.  Thank You for a lovely experience."}
{"text":"Skinny fats lives up to the hype. Believe that! Their menu is diverse and delicious. Prices are reasonable and the strip location delivers. I love this spot"}
{"text":"Yep, the great reviews are all on the mark.  Tempted to give 5 starts here, because I would say for the class, it is the best.   I would say this is my \"go-to\" spot.  Everything on the menu that I have tried is excellent.  The Ahi Fish Taco is one of the best fish tacos I have ever had, and I am a fish taco expert.  Try it, and you will be hooked.  The only complaint I would have is that it is too small and seating gets a bit dicey at peak hours."}
{"text":"Friendly and knowledgable staff! I went for the cucumber filled sushi boat! It was amazing and not too pricey. Been back several times and have had the same results from the great staff to the delicious food on both the skinny and fat sides of the menu!!"}
{"text":"This was a clean, small, hipster place to drop in for dinner. Great variety in dishes, so it might be a bit difficult to decide. They keep water with lemons and cucumber on the counter for your convenience, and I only wish that the cups provided were a bit larger. I'm sure I could just ask for one next time.   I decided on Berry the Steak, a flatbread with feta and goat cheeses, steak, arugula, berries, and balsamic reduction. My only complaint is that I wish there was more reduction on the flatbread instead of the plate so I wouldn't have to struggle to get some on the nicely toasted pastry. Excellent presentation, but not the greatest to eat. Regardless, it was still a solid dish and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. I was shocked how long the line was at first, but then I thought to myself, must be dang good if this many people are waiting. So I had the 'hot chix' salad and Mike had the 'more cow bowl'. Both were delicious. However, we did wait 20+ minutes on our entrees and my salad was delivered 7-10 minutes before Mike's food arrived BUT the manager noticed and took care of us with a full refund. We did not ask or complain at all, and they took the initiative to take care of us. I understand that it is the first week of opening and the staff is just getting used to everything, we appreciate your hospitality. Thank you again, we will be back.   Oh and you HAVE to try the lemon blueberry cookie...so dang good.."}
{"text":"Experience:  a friend brought me here to check it out. I had always wanted to try this place, but it's kinda out of the way, so I forget about it. We came around 7:30pm.   Facility: it was like a fast food spot, where you order food at the counter. It's kinda a small place, with tables and chairs squeezed in tight.   Service:  they bring the food to your table after you order. The waitress was nice and checked on us once too.   Food: they have. Avery unique me I, but we weren't super hungry. So, we decided to shared an order of Truffle Fries (3.5/5) that were hot and tasty. However, sometimes, I think places try to hard adding stuff, when hot fresh fries with salt are truly the best.  Then we ordered the Cheesy Peezy, (3/5) that was exactly that...cheesy.  It was a decent crust and good flavor.   Overall: the food was pretty good, but nothing overly fantastic. Although, there are a lot of items on the menu I want to try, both on the healthy and fattening sides, so Im sure I will be back sometime."}
{"text":"Came in here for the first time and Blaze of Thunder is very tasty. Spicy and delicious."}
{"text":"Impressed my local LV friends with this place. First, the website is great! It had photos of each menu item. The fresh morning was the favorite in our group. It is easily shareable. I also loved the arugula salad in the flatchix. There were so many wonderful flavors that blended superbly. Seating at the bar looking out the window, you will be able to see the airplanes take off. We were very impressed with the friendly service, too. We will definitely come back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Cute little joint with an interesting concept: you can choose to indulge, or you can opt for something healthier.  Order at the counter, then have a seat. From what we've heard, this new location boasts a much larger seating area, including a patio.  Food was decent. The Sweet Cheese-us $12 (aka their take on a philly cheesesteak) was pretty good. The cheese was kind of off-putting and they were a bit heavy-handed with the mushrooms (would've liked more meat), but overall, satisfying and filling.  The Meltdown $12 (patty melt) was also satisfying. No complaints.  Truffle fries were okay. Couldn't detect very much truffle oil, but I prefer the sweet potato fries over them.  Food can be a bit pricy, but otherwise decent."}
{"text":"Been to Vegas many times but this was our first time here.   They have a great diverse menu ranging from burgers to bowls to juice and shakes.   Had the chickawaffadopolis (their take on chicken and waffles), a classic burger, and a meltdown sandwich.   All were cooked well and tasty (though the chicken seemed slightly overcooked).   Tried the truffle and sweet potato fries as sides and indulged in 2 huge cookies (salted caramel and lemon/blueberry).  Great service and good food!"}
{"text":"Managers care about keeping customers. We returned and everything came out great. Excited to try some of the other dishes in the future! Would like to be able to order online from warm springs location."}
{"text":"We usually go to the newer location on 215/Decatur but this one was close and we were starving. Food wasn't as good as the other location, portion seemed smaller, smaller cramped up place but food was just different. I'll stick to location in northwest."}
{"text":"I am a fan of SkinnyFats!! I've tried numerous menu items...mostly off the happy side lol things you NEED to try:  Maine wedge add steak!! The dressing mixture has egg, blur cheese, cucumber, red onion, balsamic demi, and ranch. I LOVE this salad it makes me, well, happy!  Ahi taco san- sooooooo yummy the puffed tortilla gives awesome texture to the tempura ahi and the mango salsa adds a freshness to the taco.    Jazz hands float - sounds crazy right? A sprite float with mango. It's amazing!  Phatty philly- order this with extra blue cheese. This sandwich almost requires a fork and knife because there's so much meat!!!!   Does the location suck? Hell yes! However even with my 2 kids and husband we almost always get a table.  If you're eating solo the bar stools are the way to go. Oh and PLEASE be respectful and don't make this the 3 hour lunch spot to catch up with your high school bff the seating is limited!  Eat and leave!!!!"}
{"text":"I liked it. Tasty little sandwich and the potatoes on the side were delish. The only complaint is I requested the bacon from my sandwich be put on the side, and it was put nowhere. I got home and there was no bacon so My dog and cats and were a little sad. My husband got the smotherload and appreciated the huge chunks of filet mignon.  UPDATE: I have now been here a second time, I don't eat meat so I got some kind of hoagie sandwich that normally came with steak on it. I asked for a vegetarian version of it. I'm just gonna say,it was some kind of amazing. It was a little on the spicy side I think there may have been banana peppers on it I really didn't stop to seriously look what was on it because it was just that good. There was a cheese sauce that accompanied it because I did takeout.. I also got the sweet potato fries which were like eating candy. In a good way. Yeah I'll be stopping there on the way home from work again."}
{"text":"This is a random find just out of Vegas. The choices for breakfast are too great to choose. They are good portion and great taste. The fresh juice is a really treat too. Definitely will go back every time visit Vegas."}
{"text":"The sweet cheeseus & Meltdown will have you licking your lips. Love they have calorie conscious and like me this day who care about calories split on the menu, food is nice and hot brought out immediately. Trust u order your drink by the time your bottom hits the chair its on the table... Awesome place great friendly staff..."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Very happy with my experience.  Their food is served with a very classy look.  I will be a repeat offender of this establishment."}
{"text":"Love this place! The Meanbean is the best black bean sandwich I have ever had. It's a definite must try. The Slow Boat to China was not a disappointment either! The food is very fresh and made to order. The place is very clean. Their was a line out the door. Their menu option is very well balanced and there is something for everyone! I highly recommend trying it. They also offer a great option of fresh made juices and smoothies."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a salon morning and noticed this place was right next door. It's been on my to-do list for a while so I had to check it out!  I ordered a burger that came with two 1/4 lb. patties, two different cheeses and spicy mayo (which I requested on the side). I also added bacon and requested no bun (they didn't offer a Lettuce wrap, so I assume they don't do that?). For my side I picked the Truffle Fries based on my cashier's suggestion. I took a number and sat down. They were nice enough to package everything to-go - I ate what I could there and took the rest home.   Both the burger and fries were on the greasey side which is absolutely ok with me! The burger was juicy, simple and delicious. The fries had that great Truffle flavor, but needed a little salt in my opinion.   I also grabbed a cookie for later. It had caramel, pretzels and huge chunks of white chocolate chips. I was happy to have it at home so that I could warm it! This cookie had quite a chew to it thanks to the caramel and great Crunch from the pretzel bits.   This place was fun! I think I saw they have some kind of loaded fries? I'll have to try that next!"}
{"text":"I've been following this place on Instagram for months, so needless to say, the anticipation had built up. I was not disappointed!! The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 is because of the size and limited seating. Came here around 2 in the afternoon, so what I thought would be after rush hour (it's in an industrial part of town, so I expected lunchtime to be a madhouse); it was still crazy busy and we got really lucky with a seat for two at the counter against the window.   The employees were very friendly, and the interior itself reminds me of a restaurant you'd find in LA or NYC- definitely not typical Vegas. The menu was a great concept- healthy versus happy choices- but somewhat unorganized and difficult to understand. They were very accommodating to any dietary requests, which I know can be difficult in this day and age.   The food was incredibly fresh and yummy!! Sweet N Spicy milkshake- apple, ginger, beets, banana- and Drunken Gypsy Toast- créme brûléed brioche, fresh berries and bananas (I certainly got a lot of bananas, didn't I), and applewood smoked bacon. So delish!!   With an ever-changing menu, and so many creative healthy options (acai bowl with agave nectar, anyone?), this may just be one of my new favorite spots!! Oh, AND they deliver- love it!!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place today, we really enjoyed the food! You can tell it's made from scratch and not frozen which many restaurants do nowadays.  When you go in, you order like up front like at chipotle. Then they give you a number and you take a seat then they bring you the food!  Ambiance was nice, the food came out fast and it was really good. Servers were courteous too!  They also were giving out gluten free vegan red velvet cakes for their 5th anniversary and since it was my birthday dinner that was really appreciated!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken and waffles...and I don't like chicken and waffles...but the waffle was perfect and the chicken (expecting to find SOMETHING wrong whether it be to greasy, to oily tasting, or undercooked) was in a word PERFECT! Believe me I TRIED to find SOMETHING wrong and could not. Took a sip of my son's smoothie and it was great!Small place and I can see how it gets packed. Went at about 5 on a Friday and within the hour place was almost already filled. I would definitely go back as I was very impressed with the food.  So why only 3 stars?Location kind of sucks and I found the girl Ashley who took our order very distracting. Talked and gossiped the WHOLE time we were there. That was a bit annoying. In a place that small the workers should not be gossiping or talking continuously."}
{"text":"I had the T.A.T.S, best sandwich I've had at any restaurant so far. My husband enjoyed his meal as well, the seating is limited during lunch hour but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Pretty good service. Being there the second time, some employees still remembered us.   Dishes chose were the chicken with mango sauce and ahi poke served in a cucumber boat. The poke was a dish that, although, not completely innovative, was a good value and a good taste. I recommend it.   The chicken mango dish seemed to be just that and somewhat bland. Skip that and try something else."}
{"text":"Hands down the best portobello burger I've ever tasted! I'm over the moon that this location opened since it's much closer to me then the original location & it's nice and roomy inside.  I came on a Saturday around noon for a take out order. It definitely gets busy very quickly so the wait can get a little bit long, but still worth it. They have quite a few vegetarian options as well as fresh juices and even booze.   I really can't say enough good things about this place. I've never eaten anything here that I don't like and the staff is so friendly!"}
{"text":"Being that it's summer and I'm trying to get bikini ready I figured this is the perfect place for an after work dinner with a friend. We came here around 5:30 pm and had no time finding an available table. It is super small in here though so I could see how it could fill up quickly.   I ordered the Slow Boat To China which was absolutely delicious along with a Green Mile juice. The juice I really tried to like but just couldn't get over the tomatoes soupy taste. My friend ordered the Smoke In A Bowl which looked amazing. She did have to return it since the rice wouldn't fully cooked though.   I definitely will be back again to try some new things. I wish they had more juice flavor options."}
{"text":"love this place food was amazing only down part is that its far from the strip and its too small inside and the workers seemed weird about the secret menu when i was trying to order something off it but i go what i wanted so thats all that matters"}
{"text":"Thanks again Yelp for helping me find someplace to eat!  The two waitresses were very helpful in answering my questions and getting crayons for my kid.   I had the Meltdown and it was great! I also took a Meatzza pizza to go for my wife and she loved it as well."}
{"text":"Had the Cherry Popper burger with truffle fries. Definitely worth having again but wish the place was bigger. The seating was limited so had to eat it at work.  Expect a long line during lunch hours. Food is great though."}
{"text":"Wow can I say impressive food?! My overall is however a 3.5 along with my dining experience.   Ok we were totally lost when we walked in because all that we saw was a line.  Naturally as fine citizens of America, we just stood in line with everyone else. Lol.  Yes, not knowing what it was for.  An employee saw how confused we looked and gave us a little explanation that it was the order line.  So first, it's open seating.  So if you are trying to come with a big group, you are better off dining outside.  May I dare say that it is almost a fire hazard in there?  You can barely squeeze through to use the restroom, or maneuver your way to exit too. When tables or chairs come free, it becomes snatched up with a quickness.  I say study the menu and know what's on special.  They call it skinny fats because you can choose your evil...healthy vs some extra flavor!  The menu was a bit different because it's bunched differently then what you are normally used to.  The division of sandwiches, salads, etc. yah it's not like that.  well as I finally came around to see the board menu above, it was easier to read.  However, I was instantly distracted when I saw the eggs Benny special they had.  It was poached eggs on steak sitting on cornbread.  I think the cornbread just seriously set it off.  The flavors were sooo good.   We ordered truffle fries as a side and that just complimented it.  Ok I lied, not complimented it, we just like variety.    Well my plan of attack next time is to take my own advice and you guessed it, plan it out.   Happy eating y'all!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and friendly staff. Didn't like my food and my husband was unimpressed by his. Went there Saturday morning just after opening and it wasn't too crowded. We were in the area and didn't research much in reviews since we were hungry. Made our order and grabbed a table. I got a coffee and wasn't sure if refills were available since it looked like it was only behind the counter and nobody was doing top offs. Not a big deal and I didn't go and ask since I had water too. My husband got the chicken and waffles. He said both were ok, nothing amazing. I got the avocado-tofu scramble sandwich. They don't mention in the description that they use curry or some strong seasoning in it. I really didn't like it. My stomach wasn't in great shape to begin with and I found it nauseating. I ate half because I had ordered it, but thank goodness it came with a side. The truffle fries were really good. And I realized after I left that the sandwich had dyed my fingers yellow. I would be willing to try this place again, but I will question their descriptions a lot more. They do have a nice assortment of healthy or happy options."}
{"text":"I was just in on Saturday with a couple of friends. I thought the place looked a little small last time I was here, but this time I felt it. I was having a severe allergy day and was overwhelmed by the amount of noise. I believe almost every table was full. The lights were dimmed & the music was turned up. The inside feels very homie. Beautiful art on the wall. Quick friendly service. A lot of delicious choices. Almost didn't know what to order because everything on the menu looks like it would be satisfying.   I ordered the meltdown (patty melt). I ordered it medium rare. Came out cooked all the way through but I didn't mind because I was starving. Truffle fries on the side complete the meal nicely. I feel like the burger had a lot of meat. I only ate half.   Person taking my order was amazing. She offered me bacon and avocado on my burger which after being offered I just couldn't say no. Great Up Sell!! All employee encounters were amazing. Friendly people working quickly and efficiently. Now that I think about it I am amazed that everyone worked so well together. I have had a lot of bad service lately and can really appreciate the great service I received here.   Food came out hot and fast! Great food and great experience even though I wasn't feeling good.   I love skinny fats."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome.  I really love thier menu,  with  healthy and happy options to choose from.  I like how they break it down in the setup of the menu also. It's very easy to see which route you wanna take, healthy or happy. The names of the food items are very witty and cool. Went with the Sweet Cheese Us without onions. It was basically a glorified cheese steak sandwich, which was made to perfection. The meat was cooked well and the toppings and cheese were complimented nicely. Opted for a macadamia cookie for the side which was good. My wife went with the Mega Club sandwich which she said was very good. It was very big and filling. The ambience of the place was cool.  The workers were very nice and the girl that took our order was personable. I like that the location is off the strip which makes it easy to get to, and there is plenty of parking. My only knock on the place is that it is a rather small restaurant. There was a bit of a line when we got there,  and seating is rather limited. Larger parties would definitely have trouble finding seats. We ended up getting our food to-go for this reason,  which wasn't a huge deal but it would have been nice to eat there."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the food is soo good. It doesnt matter happy or healthy side.. they are both delicious!  Oh and try their cookies!"}
{"text":"First time eating here food was tasty and there's a lot of options whether you want healthy or unhealthy food breakfast is also served all day. Service was good you can be seated and food will be brought to you. All the workers were upbeat and good vibes."}
{"text":"Love being able to eat bomb healthy food! Haven't even tried their \"Happy\" side just because the healthy side is beyond amazing! Also, the jalapeño ketchup is the best ketchup I've ever had."}
{"text":"I love the menu, love the juices, and my husband loved his food.  I haven't yet gotten something I really liked.  That is probably because I got both of the burritos and they just lacked some flavor.  Super cute inside.  Will go back and get something new next time.  Just not a whole lot of options in the breakfast healthy side for gluten free."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cherry Popper and truffle fries, along with a Summer Quench. Simply enough, the flavors were absolutely AMAZING! Don't think about it...just go!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. The food didn't taste anything like the pictures look. We ordered to go and I felt like they were a little sloppy and didn't care about how our food was since it was to go."}
{"text":"This place should be a 5 star rating... but... took 30 mins to get my burger. Think my order was lost, several people got their orders before me, and it was a quiet time.   Cute outdoor space, food was actually really awesome! The fries were delicious. My burger was great. They had a huge selection of food and fresh juices to pick from. Highly recommend if you're craving \"fast-food\" but want something a LOT healthier!"}
{"text":"If I could give This place 10 stars I would!!! Hubs and I are staying at the Vdara on the Strip and wanted to get breakfast where there wasn't an hour late and o found this place!!!  We walked in at 10:00am this morning (7-15-16) and there's absolutely no wait.  Food is amazing and the staff is WONDERFUL. Get off the strip and come over here!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've been in the restaurant business for going on 30 years! I tried this place yesterday for the first time, it will not be my last! We were greeted by a very sweet young girl named Celina! She asked if it was our first time, as soon as I said yes, her face lit up and she immediately started giving us the \"how to\" of the place! She explained the menu, gave a few of her recommendations, how to order, and even snaked a table for us!! This place was BUSY!! She told us to expect a wait on our food, as they just got slammed, but our food came out fast!! We both ordered the Meltdown, it was awesome, cooked perfect, hot and fresh!! I highly recommend this place and can't wait for my next meal there!! The team that runs this place is top notch and it shows! I will add that I may never order off the \"skinny\" menu, as fat is where it's at!! Seriously do yourself a favor and check this place out!!!#"}
{"text":"I'm a little late in writing this review since I went a few weeks ago, but better late than never I suppose. The menu has a wide range of options. I decided on the spicy Latina soup and hummus with pita bread. They have some cute names like yummus (hummus) which is brilliant and I'm jealous I didn't come up with that. The drink cups are actually very sturdy and are made to be reused. So you can even put them in the dishwasher. They also have an option to recycle them at the restaurant instead of just throwing them in the trash. This is cool, you know, save the earth and all. The food was very tasty and fresh. The employees were nice and helpful. It was clean and I liked the atmosphere. My only complaint is that the portion to price was off. I don't mind paying for quality, but it was a little over $10 for 1/4 cup of hummus, a small pita bread, cup of soup, and small drink. I was honestly still hungry when I was done. I guess this is the skinny part in the name cause you will get skinny using their portion control."}
{"text":"So the manager from SkinnyFats reached out to me yesterday after the post about my cold fries and promised me some fresh French fries in her next time I stop by the restaurant!  That level of customer service is rare in business nowadays.  It is to be commended that people care about their customers. Thanks SkinnyFats manager lady, you've earned a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Very good. Good variety on menu. Thought our dishes. I excellent customer service. A gem not far from the strip and a must do for lunch while in Vegas. I love that they have healthy and hearty menu items so there's something for everyone. Wish we could franchise them to Florida!"}
{"text":"We have driven through Vegas so many times and been disappointed with our \"quick meal\" choices, but not tonight.  We found SkinnyFats on Yelp and thought we'd give it a shot based on the good reviews. Our whole family loved it! The food was very unique and delicious. The Ahi Taco-San was amazing! The kids loved the cheese quesadillas with chicken. My wife and I both loved the cucumber boat \"shareables.\"  We will definitely be stopping here again!"}
{"text":"The Bomb diggity. Yea I said it. My little brother and his friend ordered 2 plates and I ordered 2 plates. Every single plate was good.  How does that happen??? I will go back every time I  go out to vegas."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum healthy choices that are tasty too! Wish they made their jalepeno ketchup travel size! Hubby and I were pleased with both breakfast dishes!"}
{"text":"Yes. 5 stars for SkinnyFats, even though I did not care for the CauliFire. We ordered the veggie burger, bean burger, steak sandwich, Asian chicken salad (Slow Boat), and steak salad. Forgive me for not remembering their names from the menu, but you can figure it out. Everything we ordered was from the skinny side of the menu. Everything was fantastic except for the spicy cauliflower. I did not care for it. All of the above plus three drinks came out to $68.00 total. Well worth it. The quality of the food was excellent!!  I highly recommend this place. I will be back to try the fat side of the menu. The chicken and waffles look pretty good."}
{"text":"I came to SkinnyFATS by recommendation of a friend who lives in Vegas.  I'm not sure about the other locations but when you come to this one you maybe think you're at the wrong place. It's very industrial.  The food might be hyped but it's the extraordinary. It's quite average. They took out a Cinnutella waffle dessert. That was the whole point why we came. Well, we ordered another dessert which was good as well.  I just think it's too pricey overall. What a normal restaurant charges $10 for waffles? And my Zucc.It vegetarian bowl was gone after 5 bites.  Nice ambient, very modern, trendy and catered to the young crowd with charger, USB outlets and nice gimmicks here and there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place, although they also serve lunch and munchies. Seeing how I have been here couple of times, my favorite so far is the Happy Side Wake N Bacon - must be something about that sriracha cream cheese  The wait staff girls are always sweet and friendly and accommodating. They have an outdoor patio, high communal table to share and make friends with strangers, booths and regular cafe tables. The interior design is pretty sweet too."}
{"text":"Horrid! We went to eat there and the place is filled with DOGS! Don't get me wrong I love dogs but not in a restaurant especially when the manager didn't do anything about it!!  Food was cold and looked like it has been reheated before served to us. If I could give zero I would"}
{"text":"Love love love the fresh Juices ! If you love freshly juiced fruits & veggies this is as good as it gets ! Friendly & pretty staff too !"}
{"text":"Light and hearty. Everything was good! I really can't wait to get a quick bite again. We got lucky and. Err wasn't a line one Saturday morning but once we sat down a line started to form. Ordered a bunch of plates for 4 of us and ended up eating it all! The burgers were good, I had the BLT which was put together perfectly. Super good flavor with the perfect crunch. Will go again!"}
{"text":"Being on the road all day can work up a monster appetite. While passing through Vegas, I always get excited to stop at SkinnyFATS because of the plethora of different choices and flavored of food they offer. While passing though town today I worked up an appetite for a plate of chicken and waffles and I'm probably not the first to tell you that SkinnyFATS has hands down best chicken and waffles I've ever had (ever!). The waffle is light crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The chicken on top is lightly breaded, deep fried and is so juicy! It is served with a light dust of powdered sugar and a cup of maple syrup on the side. Absolutely LOVE the sweet and salty combo of this dish. I've been to both locations in Las Vegas, and are equally satisfying and great. I WILL be returning :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten nearly every dish on this menu, and I still don't understand the hype about SkinnyFATS. Their menu is described with all of the knicks knacks you would expect on a \"foodie\" lover menu. Don't let the aioli, truffle dialogue fool you. This place is unfortunately sloppy, and they use way too much sauce. Their juices are not actual pressed juices they are made up of store bought juices, and still cost as much as a pressed juice. Their tacos are cold, the zuc-it is just tomato sauce, and the burgers are dry. This place is low quality, and over priced. Not to mention- it is always busy and low staffed."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast meals I've had in a long time, Chicken and Waffles were awesome, small place with limited seating but great food!"}
{"text":"I love SkinnyFATS! It's always a great choice for brunch lunch or dinner! I love how you can pick your mood: happy or healthy!   I've pretty much tried half the menu already and I haven't not loved anything I've ordered!   My faves: spughetti, chix on broadway, nice to Greek you!"}
{"text":"Second time here. Service with a smile both times. It's a tiny spot with maybe 10 tables so it's feels busy both times. There's some seating at the window with bar stools and you can watch the cars go by.   The menu is tricky. I find it hard to decide what I want because the combinations are not something I would put together myself.   The food though has been yummy both times. It's just takes me awhile to finally choose something. The staff will happily make suggestions and help though so that's nice."}
{"text":"Been here 3X - breakfast, late lunch, and lunch.    Finding a healthy and innovative menu with quality ingredients is hard to find in Las Vegas, and Skinnyfats does a great job.  I've only ordered off of their healthy side, but everything that comes out of the kitchen looks great.  I wish they had a couple more salads on the menu, because they understand the concept of high quality greens & salad dressings, and don't drown the salads with the dressing.    I was all set to give it 5 stars.  However, this last visit, I made the mistake of showing up at lunch time.  The inefficiency was hard to watch.  I used to go to a similar size restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating in San Francisco which also had just one cash register going, and delivered the food to the tables via number.  Night and day difference in terms of getting customers through the process from arrival to departure in a timely manner.  Skinnyfats has a salad called the slow boat to china - we were all making jokes that the line should be called the slow boat to skinnyfats.   .  Will be back - just not at peak times."}
{"text":"Just tried to place i was curious what the hype was all about When i first walked it had an interesting decor  This menu is a little different then your usual sandwich place like ( subway jersey mikes etc...) I ordered that meltdown and i really loved it It was juicy and it melted in my mouth This place was not a let down  i drive by this place everyday and can wait for my next new journey into this place"}
{"text":"When we arrived to pick up our orders we were informed that the online order system was down and we would be getting a refund! It would have been nice if we would have been told prior, to driving to get our lunch! I placed my order before 9AM for pickup at 11:40AM, this would have plenty of time for some to reach out and let us know the the system was down! I spent 30 minuets of my hour lunch break driving to SkinnyFATS and then had to go somewhere else to get lunch!  I love SkinnyFATS but this will be the last time I buy from this location!  I've had other issues at this location also!"}
{"text":"Wow delicious food with amazing options!   Staff is extremely friendly and happy!   New favorite Balls a must try!   Smoke in a Bowl is yummy!   Next time will have to get breakfast!   Love the atmosphere and can't say enough about the staff!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly people and reasonably priced. From San Diego and we're making this a must go to when we're in town. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Not my first time here but everything I try is soo good! This time I tried the chix on Broadway breaded chicken blt on brioche bun! So good"}
{"text":"Food is alright it's kinda bland and flat. But I like the set up of this restaurant specially the outdoor tables and smoothies are good here."}
{"text":"The staff there is so sweet and wonderful and amazing and the food is absolutely delicious I could eat there every single night not only that but you can change up the menu and customize it how you want it so good"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place because it's so close to my house. It's a cool concept with great descriptions and flavor profiles. I ordered the Smoke in A Bowl because the agave buffalo chicken sounded great, but was extremely disappointed with the bland flavor, lack of depth, and hard jasmine rice. My friend ordered a fried chicken sandwich and only ate the top bun and fries. Not even the chicken or bacon....  I only give this restaurant 2 stars for the friendly and quick service with the staff. They were all on point and very kind. Probably a good place to grab a quick smoothie on a lunch break. Will not be back."}
{"text":"After reading all the excellent reviews this restaurant has, my husband and I decided to order here for the first time and give it a chance.  Let me put it politely - It was disgusting and we threw away all of our food after the first bite.  We ordered delivery via Postmates and received our order within 30 mins.  Nobody really complains about fast delivery but that should have been our first warning.  We did receive our food hot, I ordered the Chix on Broadway sandwich with a side of truffle fries and my husband ordered the Bomb Diggity with a side of yummus pita.  The breaded chicken on the sandwich was bland.  It had absolutely no flavor in the fried batter.  Also, the bread on my husband's sandwich tasted old and rubbery and his sandwich in general was justcompletely dry.  The yummus was also very bland.  Everything tasted like it was prepared days before.  Honestly, we would've been better off ordering from McDonalds.     We are so disappointed with our experience and will never eat at this restaurant ever again.  PS... We both got extremely sick after eating the food."}
{"text":"Skinny Fats was a fabulous discovery tucked away in an office complex in Las Vegas.  The food was healthy, delicious and had enough variety to provide a great breakfast for part of our group and fabulous lunch for the non-breakfast eaters.  Service was friendly and fun. I rarely do Yelp reviews but this place deserves the 5 star rating and is absolutely worth going out of your way for the high quality and truly tasty food."}
{"text":"Menu has plenty of options to choose from. I like that they have it divided into a \"Healthy\" and \"Happy sides. They also have daily specials that can be viewed on the digital picture frames by the register.   The place itself seems somewhat small, not too much seating. Our party of 10 had to sit separately between to tables.   The service was great, the food was tasty. I would return to try the other options."}
{"text":"First time and definitely impressed. The service was great and the food pretty good. I got the Zucc It with tofu and it was the best veggie pasta I've had at a restaurant. Will definitely be back here!   Also, the truffle fries and fat pickles were good for that carb load!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! We have been there twice now and shared 4 dishes to get a variety of their menu, all were amazing! They have delicious juices and smoothies on the kids menu. I highly recommend their \"cherry popper\" burger if your in the mood for a hamburger or the chickhummus sandwich with bacon if your craving chicken. You get several choices in sides and so far I like their truffle fries the best. The staff is wonderful and the service is fast. Both times we have stopped in they have been busy with a lime, but they move through them very quickly!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. I always go there for one item which is ahi taco san the one happy side with fluffy and crispy tortillas. I know how it suppose to come.  Not sure if they changed recipe  or changed chef.. tortillas were under cooked not even crispy at all. I waited 15 min and another 10min to drive home to open my take out.. I'm very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  There's great food for everyone here!  Enjoying the Chicken Quinoa soup and the G.O.A.T. salad."}
{"text":"So glad a colleague recommended this place! We almost didn't find it bc it's tucked away in some off strip quiet office area. Food is delicious! Came quickly, Priced fairly, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out! The place is small, but they make it work. The decor is pretty cool & the food is great. The buff chix and superstar wrap was soooooooooo good! we came in the day before my boyfriend's birthday & he got a free birthday float of his choice! Hehe so yummy!"}
{"text":"Good, service, & atmosphere was amazing! A must stop to eat if you're a health junky for sure. Place can get packed pretty quick which can cause issues if you wanna sit down & eat. But that just goes to show how good the food is. Do stop by & check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Everything from the food, service & atmosphere was exactly the same as the Decatur location. The only difference is the fact there's a spot where you can eat outdoors and enjoy the sun & fresh air. The staff was friendly and down to earth. As expected from all staff working at SkinnyFats. I use to go to the Decatur location whenever I went to that side of town to visit friends. It's a must if I'm ever hungry lol. Healthy, delicious and fresh! Hit them up!!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite go to places for lunch or dinner! Love that you can eat either the healthy or happy side! I have never had a bad experience here! Everything that looks and sounds good always meets my expectations."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mean bean burger, with a side of fruit ($9.95). I liked it BUT it was super spicy for me, I just wish they would advertise it! Other than that, the ingredients were fresh and the bread was very tasty. My bf ordered another burger (don't remember the name but it had steak) with a side if sweet potato fries, and those were delicious! Highly recommend ordering them.  As a vegan costumer, I really appreciate that they have plenty of options and it's very easy to spot those vegan options as they're marked with VG on the menu.   They serve breakfast all day, juices (not sure if they're cold pressed though) and coffee. And lemon-cucumber water is free! Service was good and everything was clean."}
{"text":"Stopped in early Saturday morning with a friend. She had a breakfast sandwich and really liked it. She had a side of breakfast potatoes and they were good, could use a little more of the peppers in our opinion but I understand not everyone would like that. I had the ahi srirachi taco and it was good but I also had the turnip taco and that was my favorite! They also have cookies that I wanted to try but the line got long. This location is a little small but I'd like to check out the other two. I've heard the slow boat to china is delicious and I like that the menu is split into healthy and happy."}
{"text":"You are going to encounter staff that make you seriously smile the whole time you are ordering. The couple in front of us last time we visited took FOREVER, but we didn't mind because the cashier was taking their time making sure they understood what they were ordering and helping them find exactly the right item, but in a way that was absolutely hilarious.  The food is amazing, go outside your comfort zone. My favorite item right now is Ballz... and my kids are loving the pancakes.  Just go and have fun! you will enjoy it"}
{"text":"I need to go back to Vegas to hit this place up. It's been a few months, I'm craving!  Seriously though, this place has great food.   The menu has two sides, healthy and happy, but there is lots of each to find in the other. The healthy dishes are very tasty, and the happy dishes are very flavorful while remaining mostly healthy.  I love tuna, so I found the ahi sirachi to be an amazing mix of flavors, while consisting of healthy ingredients like the vegetable slaw, mango, and a wheat tortilla. The ingredients seem to be of a high quality as well.  I'm mostly a carnivore, but the veggie sandwich even had me drooling. There are several other kinds of dishes I already want to try.  The one drawback is that this place may be too popular, especially given the smallness of the location. Finding seating can be a battle; at peak hours a large group might be hopeless.  The art on the walls is fun and not overdone. Oh and I actually bought one of their shirts and wear it often. Not only to rep the restaurant but mostly to rep the message on the front -- \"live happy.\"  If I had one of these in LA, I assuredly would!"}
{"text":"The food here is great but the customer service for the last three times I've gone is unprofessional. I asked for my smoothie twice, and by the third time, the waitress seemed annoyed with me because I wanted my smoothie. Took them to the end of my meal to finally bring me my smoothie in a pre-made bottle."}
{"text":"We highly recommend this establishment. Amazing food, the employee's are friendly and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not very impressed by the service and food. First, the skinny side of the food is loaded with sugars and toppings which are not healthy. For being a newer restaurant, you would think the service would be top notch to get the word out. Anyway, when we entered, I made it a point to say it was my first time because I did not understand if we should seat ourselves or order first. The lady was not friendly and could not answer detailed questions about the menu. The food was fair but the salad had heavy dressings. There is noting unique about this place. Meh..."}
{"text":"The line was ridiculously long...but that means it has good food.  I ordered from the skinny side (grilled chicken and hummus sandwich). It was pretty good. The atmosphere is great and I loved the decor inside."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot! Affordable, tasty, and the staff is awesome. I will definitely be back to try some other options. The got a steak peanut stir fry and it was very tasty. The juices are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Love the food!! You have the healthy/fitness side and also the cheat day side! Love it!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday. I drove to the location and I thought I drove to the wrong place because the area this restuarant is located in seemed very discreet. Make sure to grab a table if you're eating there because this place is kinda small and if it's crowded then good luck trying to find a place to sit.It was cool how they had a menu if you're trying to eat healthy and a menu for the opposite. When I received my order there was a hair in it the workers really need to wear hair nets or something because I really lost my appetite after that.  Just wanted to update my review the manager messages me personally on yelp after seeing this review and offered me a $25 gift card. I work in retail and the type of workers who do these things for customers definitely know how to run a business. I will be coming back they went above and beyond my expectations after this."}
{"text":"It almost seems silly to write a review for this place, since it's already (and has been) absolutely killing the Yelp-iverse, but our meal tonight (5/1/16) was too worthy to stay quiet.   First off, if you don't know about this location's whereabouts, you'll miss it if you're not paying attention. Which almost adds to the lore of the place!! Wizardry at work here people. SkinnyFats knows exactly what they're doing. Small dining room, just big enough for the amount of people that can find, or know about, their spot. Super wavy decor. On point.   Secondly, it's smart to opt for the secret menu for creativeness, i.e. \"Balls 2.0\". Wow. Just wow. Deep fried corn and risotto balls, in a creamy sauce of epic proportions, with micro greens and a plethora of flavor happiness!! Every time.   Now for the rest:  Kids food is so fun here. \"Clucky Toes\"= chicken fingers + side of choice. \"Nutty Banany\"= peanut butter and banana on multigrain toast. Yum!   \"Cranburky\"= a cranberry and turkey party, with sage and some festive seasonings on a whole wheat bun with lettuce and tomato. \"Naked Chix\"= grilled chicken breast in an awesome mango salsa sauce atop brown rice with cilantro-yo!! Light yet flavorful. Truffle fries are always a must. Crisp and savory. The cream soda is the best around.   Really nothing bad can be said about the food!! Delicioso!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been here a few times now since they have both a happy side and a healthy side.   Super casual and never packed when we go, maybe because we try to go late night. Cashiers are always helpful since we've had different ones each time we come in and we always ask their opinion on favorites.   Appetizers we've had:  Balls 2.0- AMAAAAZING, don't question just try it. You won't be disappointed   Truffle fries: although big in size, it lacked flavor and zero truffle flavor. I wouldn't say I'm a truffle fry expert, but I have had my fair share.   Main dishes:  Naked chix: really good, hubb's staple dish  More cow bowl: I'm so disappointed that the beef is so chewy, I've ordered the beef dish twice and still chewy so I've given up ordering anything 'filet mignon' mentioned on their menu. Other than that the taste of the dish is pretty good, just a bummer that the beef is such a disappointment.   Turnip taco: good, yet again the beef was such a downfall. Def would swap out for ahi  Ahi srirachi: soo yummy! Has a kick but nothing major, def a good mix of sweet and spicy"}
{"text":"I was searching on yelp and I found this place. Great place I'll definitely come back on my next trip to vegas"}
{"text":"Come for the Naked Chix, stay for the Aesthetic... lunch time line is long, indoor seating goes fast in this heat."}
{"text":"this place is a good place to lay back and relax and listen to music. the employees are very nice and enjoyed there STAKEation."}
{"text":"Best Find In A Long Time!!!! Food Was Great!! Presentation Was Great!! Place Was Packed But Was Handled Well..Highly Recommend It!!!"}
{"text":"Always great service and friendly staff. The food is unbelievably good. They always have a different Benedict for breakfast, I've had many of them and they have always been incredible.  The \"smotherload\" is one of my favorites also.  The \"\"Tu Nuts\" is a must!"}
{"text":"5 stars no doubt! A bit small but lucky for us we didn't have a problem with having to wait. I was greeted and assisted the moment I walked in. I'm big on customer service and staff here are excellent. So many plates to choose from it took me longer than normal to place my order. I finally decided on Happy Mess. Steak was perfectly cooked to melt in my mouth, no wedged pieces lodged in my teeth is a plus! Fries were so bomb I cleaned my bowl dry! I'm going back before I fly back home! A MUST if your visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, or should I say #Skinnyfattastic! My girl Zia took good care of us. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! We ordered the Steak Eyes and Chickawaffadopolis. I can hands down say this was the best breakfast I have EVER had. Serving size was perfect! Lots of chicken for the waffles. Extraordinary flavors!! Down side, place is small and cramped but easy to see past with their amazing food! Up side, looks like they are expanding!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Was really busy around 1pm when we went. Environment was really fun and great service. Will be coming back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Happy this one opened close to home!! Love everything about this place-from breakfast to dinner. Oh, and the twinkly lights outside. Soooo happy!"}
{"text":"The food is great!  They lack seating."}
{"text":"So glad this place opened by my house. Never had the chance to go to the one on Dean Martin because it was far away. The food is delicious! The cherry popper is my favorite thing on the menu! The buff chix were good too. The staff is extremely friendly and always greeting and saying good bye to customers. The ONLY reason I'm giving 4 stars is because when I got there, they were out of every soda on tap :'( I was really looking forward to the cream soda. But other than that issue it would be a 5 star place!!!"}
{"text":"Always order the Chick-hum sandwich; it's not the most amazing thing I've ever put in my mouth, but it's pretty good, and it's a healthy option!  There are so many other plates that look INCREDIBLE.  I intend to try them when I'm not concerned about calories.  The chicken and waffles looked like the way to go from the \"not skinny\" side."}
{"text":"First time here.   Whoa!! You'll drive right by heading north, but there is a gigantic sign southbound!  Small obscure eatery with limited seating. It looks like about 1/2 do takeout.   Super friendly staff who hustles and always smiled.   I had the Steak Eyes, which used excellent flavorful tender Filler Mignon, 2 eggs done perfectly over the best corn bread muffins I have ever had. The entire dish was complemented with a nice gravy.   The Smoke in the Bowl was good. The sauce was unique but I think they had too much rice in relation to everything else.   The taquitos were stuffed with shredded lime chicken and guacamole. Very nice, but a salsa dip would complete it.   Busy but fun.   Will return."}
{"text":"THE BESTT!!!!! Just like the sandlot. The food was amazing and the fountain drinks tasted so good. I'm fantasizing about the food right now. The cherry popper yummmmmmm and there fries, sweet potato and the other seasoned ones. And the service was amazing. Atmosphere was great as well. Oh yeah the salted caramel cookie was to die for. Alright I'm going again lol."}
{"text":"The Place: This place is off the Strip but worth the short drive. There is a huge billboard above the restaurant to indicate exactly where is it. It's pretty small inside and there's open seating, so expect to wait on busy days. They don't take reservations. To-go is available and when I was there, a good 1/3rd of the people in line were there to pick up orders.   The Food: We ordered the Wrap Supastar (chicken, spinach, egg white burrito, Cajun cilantro yo, avo pico) from the all-day breakfast section and the Smoke in a Bowl (agave BBQ chicken, peppers, onions, pineapple, black bean salsa, cilantro yo, jasmine rice) from the Things in Bowls section. The Wrap Supastar is served as a wet burrito with the Cajun cilantro sauce drizzled on top. Loved the flavor and liked how it didn't leave you with that heavy feeling you can get after eating regular burritos. The Smoke in a Bowl was sweet and tangy. They were very generous with all the ingredients which made for a satisfying meal.   Tips: * Call ahead to check on the wait time. Calling the number on the Yelp profile will take you to the main number for all the locations, so make sure to choose the correct one.  * If ordering to-go, you can order online. * Parking is available but most of the nearby spots get taken first."}
{"text":"AMAZING EATS at Skinny Fats !  Menu has a lot to offer for any craving. From fresh to juices to savory dishes to sweet and delectable goodness. I am a total breakfast junkie and to come across the Strawberry pancakes, with brie and Glazed Balsamic just made my heart pitter-patter.   It was everything I expected and more. Perfect portion, sweet, tart and savory. Who came up with this concoction ? I'd like to give him/her a BIG High 5 !!  Staff is super friendly and just beaming with smiles. Not too big of a space but crowd flowed smoothly. Water with cucumber lemon was a help yourself and soda offered was made with Cane Sugar.   Skinny Fats PUH_LEEZE open a location in Southern California !!"}
{"text":"Love this spot, Excellent selection of naughty and nice dinning options to choose from!"}
{"text":"Coming here again for lunch got the smother load no tortilla egg whites sauce on the side. The nice to Greek you and the skinny q. The nice to Greek you could be best described as a chicken feta salad on flatbread and I loved it I also ordered the skinny q since the portions on the flatbreads are small and wasn't as big of a fan since it ends up like a flatbread chicken BBq sauce philly and I'm not a huge fan of peppers. The smother load was pretty good but the order came out wrong the first time which isn't the first time it's happened here seems they struggle with custom orders since they are usually such high volume.  Good food good service but if you're picky and irritable probably not the best place to go."}
{"text":"Cherry popper burger for the win. Some of the best sweet potato fries ever! Perfect name! Get here early! Seating is at a premium at all locations. There's a line for a reason! No line = bad food. This place is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Yessssss!!!! I'm so happy to FINALLY have a Skinny Fats on this side of town! Skinny Fats is located at the old Ribs n Burger location in Downtown Summerlin and they have a great patio area. Downtown Summerlin is also bringing in Makers and Finders, so happy to see them supporting local businesses instead of the giant chain restaurants.  I popped in to Skinny Fats on a Saturday morning right after they opened and ordered a couple breakfast dishes as well as the Caulifire (because I CANNOT come to Skinny Fats and not order the Caulifire).  If you haven't been to Skinny Fats, the idea is that half the menu is Indulgent and the other half is Healthy (though still delicious). It's a great low-key date place because you can order one entree from each side and share, and not feel too guilty.   ...My only issue (and it's kind of a big one) is that if you're a low-carb eater or eat a keto / ketogenic diet, there are very few options. Both sides of the menu are pretty carb heavy. Granted, they will customize. (We ordered the Smotherload burrito minus the potatoes and minus the tortilla as well as the Wake n Bacon minus the bun and they were happy to oblige.)  Buuuuut....it would be nice if they had a couple more non-carby options. I will definitely be trying that Zucchini bowl though!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with this place?!?! How has no one come up with this concept before now...skinny fats?  It's basically the best idea ever - especially for a co-ed lunch or dinner.  The concept is that one side of the menu is super healthy, and the other side is indulgent.  I've tried several things (on both sides of the menu), and EVERYTHING has been incredible.  My favorite item, believe it or not, is the buffalo roasted cauliflower.  It's like chicken wings without all the guilt...DELISH!!  They have incredible and innovative bennies on the weekends too - I keep meaning to go!  The food is on POINT - Chef Josh Green is legit.  The service is great, the portions are perfect, and even the ambience is fantastic.  The only thing I initially thought that was weird is the location - but considering that a.) they deliver and b.) it's near an office park, it's actually not that weird.  If you know your way around the city, it's super easy to get to.  OH - and they have two other locations as well! :)  I frickin' love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food. Although I have only ordered from the fat menu. Either way it's really good!!"}
{"text":"I love that they have the healthy and happy side of the menu. I wanted to eat the healthy side, but I couldn't resist the happy side. I had the cherry popper, and oh man. Incredible. My wife had the meat flatbread pizza. The place was a little difficult to find, but wow it was worth it."}
{"text":"BS++  American comfort food.  Clean eating with a little bit of badassery.  It's supposed to be a cheat day but i feel like I'm eating clean when I'm training by just eating here.  The place is a good size.  Bathrooms are clean.  The kitchen is clean.  The staff is friendly.  I ordered a lot and I feel like I meal prep for the week.  I never been here before so this is a dope first experience.  If you're looking for some comfort food come here.  Try the Mac-N-Cheese also.  It's the bomb.com.  I know this review is not as cool as the elites but take it from an NYC foodie.  This place is an A+ for cleanliness.  And Boomsauce ++ on my food scale.   Food is edible and messy but bomb. Restrooms are good. Table wait time none usually unless it's a holiday Take out wait time is meh. Customer service is good. Tables and chairs are comfy   * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is wack son! BS = it's just O.K.  BS+ = Yo! I like. BS++= That's Whoa! That's good. BS+++= Dayumm! That's fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"Great vibe and spicy veggie entrees. Spudgetti was excellent too, as was Steakation with truffle fries. Really fun place and great staff. Happy place with excellent food."}
{"text":"Came in last week with my boyfriend since we heard good things about it! Inside is super colorful and lively, but casual- I love it!!!  The name is spot on lol. They have both a healthy menu and guilty- I meannnnn a more pleasurable menu. I was a bit overwhelmed when ordering but our server, Justin recommended the filet o fire which was delicious, and we also got the truffle fries. Staff overall was very nice and Justin was both friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable of the menu. Will be returning!!!!!! :3"}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is all about.  I work in the same complex as this location.  Tried them out a couple times months ago and wasn't impressed and just gave them another shot.  Because I was in a rush, I walked over to grab something real quick.  Waited in line for 10 minutes without moving, their service is excruciatingly slow.  Went back to my office to place an order on line, went back 15-20 minutes later to pick it up and a few people that were in front of me were still waiting on their food.  Ordered the Motherload Burrito and feels like they cut the potatoes into chunks and forgot to cook them.  Will be my last time going there."}
{"text":"Great experience. Staff was nice and very prompt. Atmosphere very trendy. We ordered the steak eyes & the chicken and waffles, plus the immunity smoothie. Their smoothies are the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went in with no real expectations...Ordered the immunity shake & steak with eggs. .asked to be seated outside and was accommodated with my request. The food was amazing. The culinary expertise of plating this meal was superb to none.  I was in awe of the menagerie of tastes. It was definitely one that i will partake in again.  The location is perfect with the quaint outdoor seating.  I want to delight in this atmosphere at night to watch the lights that are carefully hung. ...would recommend highly"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant before because the food is great and have never had any issues.  Today 8/22/2016, I went here for lunch with some co-workers and the line was long so I ordered online which was not a problem.  Some of us waited in line to order to go.  I had placed my order and was given a time the order will be finished and mind you that my order was placed 5 minutes before the co-workers that waited in line.  I ordered the Ahi Srirachi and  Ahi Taco-San.  My co-workers ordered the Meltdown (medium well) and the other ordered Filet O Fire(well done).  Their order came out before mine and my order was finished 15 minutes after the given time.  We bring our order to work to eat and my Ahi Taco-San was delicious as normal but my Ahi Srirachi was not so.  The ahi was rubbery which normally means not fresh.     My co-workers Meltdown which she ordered medium well was at medium rare.  My other co-workers Filet O Fire which she ordered well done was about a medium.  So I guess you get your meats 2 levels down from where you want it.  I usually go here 3 times a month but I will not be coming here for awhile since there are many other options now in this area.  Maybe it is a new cook that they have or something.  This restaurant was one of my favorites but service and food quality is dropping.  UPDATE  I went back to Skinny Fats at a later date to give them a second chance and the food was delicious as normal.  I guess they had an off day or something but I will be coming back more often."}
{"text":"Food is great and the staff is friendly. Only downside is that the place is too small and in a strange location."}
{"text":"Ahh. Haven't been back in such a long time! The food is so good, I've forgotten what I was missing out on. The staff up front were so welcoming and nice. & this time the place wasn't so crowded.  What we ordered:  Cherry popper. Sooo good! Make sure you add bacon, you'll thank me later ;) truffle fries were Suttle with the flavor but oh so good.  Chix on broadway. My boyfriends favorite.   Their drinks are bottomless so make sure to check their strawberry lemonade. It's so addicting. Charity, the manager was so nice & handle our old situation in such a professional way.  We are Sooo glad we gave this place another try. Definitely worth coming back again."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite from this place!!! Aside from the Tunuts that I'm totally obsessed with, Cherry popper tops the menu ;) with the juicy angus beef, perfectly cooked egg, with that yummy cole slaw & a hint of spice. How can you not break your diet for this \"happy\" menu choice?!  It's just a little too pricey for my liking. But the up side, it comes with the truffle fries so it makes up for the price."}
{"text":"This place was so great the service was fast and friendly! I came here on our date night with my husband such a cute patio seating area well lit and had outdoor heaters! You order at the counter and they bring your food to you.  My husband ordered the cherry popper burger with a side of truffle fries it looked delicious and he devoured it! We also got the summer quench juice which was delicious it was tart and refreshing with a little zing!  I ordered the messy fries or something like that...the steak was super tender and I had cheddar cheese instead of blue cheese crumbles and added avocado they don't give you much but it's good! We really enjoyed this place and will certainly be back to have one of those cucumber boats and more juices!!!"}
{"text":"The Rediliocius was very good! Strawberrys and pancakes really was a great fix. The side of bacon complemented the dish really well.  I'd go back here and try some of their Healthy options. Great local spot, that's hip and trendy."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch time.  I ordered Steakation, truffle fries, and lunch and it was over $20. Expensive for lunch on Las Vegas.  Though it was expensive, the food was good and filling.  I'll definitely come back again for the truffle fries."}
{"text":"Skinnyfats is an order at the counter then seat yourself kind of establishment. If they're not busy, they'll say welcome.   I think it's cool how they have a healthy side & happy side. They give you the calories for the healthy side. Honestly, I wish they would give you the calories for the happy side too. Maybe that's just me lol.   Anyways, I've tried a couple of things on their menu and I've liked most things. My favorite shareable is the shrimp in boat. It's on the healthy side & it's so good (has a little kick just FYI). If you don't feel like being healthy, you can definitely get the pimp shrimp from the happy side -- much yum. My favorite favorite thing ever on their menu is their sweet potato fries. My goodness. I don't think anyone else makes it like skinnyfats. It's always crispy & they put a little salt on there... heaven!   I'm deducting a star because it's a bit pricey, imo. But I guess that's how all the \"healthy hipster\" are nowadays."}
{"text":"Love this place! Really trying to stay HCG diet friendly and SkinnyFats is making my life easier. I love the breakfast and nearly everything on the healthy side. I'm sure the happy side is even better!"}
{"text":"This place is a healthy/ not so healthy combination. They have the coolest salt and pepper shakers which is a cute little addition to this adorable place. The food was really good and portions where a decent size . Coffee was good service was excellent."}
{"text":"Came visiting for the weekend and my friend who lives in Las Vegas took us to this place. The food was pretty good I got the chicken and waffles(Chickawaffadopolis or something thing close to that *have a picture with the actually name pls ref.) yeah it was good but my only reason to give it 4 stars is because my food came around 5 minutes after everyone else's I know it was busy and staff was packed but,no one likes waiting for their food while the rest of your party of 4 already got theirs. But hey I would recommend it wasn't a bad place"}
{"text":"I think this place is great. Really good service from the employees, and also really great variety of menu choices. I never get bored of going here. The shrimp tacodillas were so tasty! I recommend this to everyone if they haven't been here yet."}
{"text":"Found this place while on Vegas for 3 days!!not what I expected after reading reviews about  this \" healthy breakfast place\" everything in the menu sounded sooo good but tasted really bad sorry Skinnyfats not coming back!!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot. You order at the counter and pay, they give you a number and you pick an ooen table. The place geared towards healthy eaters (which I am not).I had the chicken and waffles. The waffle was good but the chicken was not very flavorful. I told them and they adjusted the price for me. All in all I would say give it a shot but I will not come back."}
{"text":"Super charming and hip American eatery. This place gets packed quick! I was here at 9:30 a.m. and the breakfast crowd was already in full swing. Located in an industrial park, there is a giant billboard sign with an arrow helping drivers where to pull in from Dean Martin Drive. Although the space is small, it runs quite efficiently and the staff are all really helpful. They explain how the menu works with one side being healthy \"Skinny\" like salads and wraps and the other side \"Fats\" being the more indulgent items on the menu. Either way, the big bright menu is very easy to read and just about everything looks good. Coffee, eggs, and pancakes are available for breakfast and I will be sure to try some of those goodies next time since I was here for their lunch menu. I ordered the Chix on Broadway with a side of truffle fries and they were both really good. Big juicy chicken piece and not too salty fries. I would order it again.   Since it is in an industrial park, the space has limited seating, so I personally would grab to to go, unless you come right when they open. Maybe not so great for large groups, but they do offer catering! Overall, great service, cool menu, and decent pricing. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed... And I'm such a food lover. I've never been so disappointed on food before, lol.  I ordered the nice to greek you $7 (gluten free). The picture looked so good and to die for on yelp so I ordered it. But as soon as I took that first bite. I didn't like it at all. Personally, it just doesn't go together on a flat bread. Thanks but no thanks, I'll stick to my greek salad. I also ordered the truffle fries and if you know me... I LOVE FRIES!!! But these fries were like really soggy and oily. Whyyyyyy???!!!? ): (In a whiny baby voice) and my chai tea... What the?? It was horrible! And I love chai tea. My chai tasted like water with a small tiny hint of chai flavor. Barely even there.   Everyone I know raved so much on this place so I got high hopes. Ended up being disappointed big time. I gave it three stars because my little brother ordered this burrito and it was tasty. I was going to order his but I didn't feel like spending more money because I wasted my food. I'm glad my little twin brothers enjoyed their food. But mine was just Bleh. I will come back to try something different though."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Wish there was more seating room because it's a small place & gets really busy around lunch.   Their menu is great,  best of both worlds- healthy & happy.   You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"My friend began as a follower of this restaurant on IG. When we decided to make a trip to Vegas from California we decided, this is the place to go! The moment we arrived into the strip area, we came to try this place. The location is kind of weird. It's away from the strip by 10 minutes or so, and it's not in a plaza. This place is located in an area filled with industrial and commercial buildings. There's plenty of parking and service is very fast!! You can look at all their food on Instagram as they like to showcase their food there.   The line was not long, the restaurant is a bit small so when waiting for a table it can be kind of long. You take your own table so you have to fight and compete. I remember when we came here, someone argued with my friend about a table. Anyways, they're portions are HUGE!!! We ended up taking everything to go and eating it in the middle of the night after clubbing. I ordered their fried chicken sandwich because when I went up to the cashier and asked for recommendations she said this one would really fill me up. The price is a bit higher, but the portion is CRAZY. My friends order a burrito and burger and they were all HUGE!!! The truffle fries here are also AMAZINg! I would recommend ordering different things with friends and sharing to try it all!! They also have plenty of shakes and smoothies to try!   Definitely recommend this place if you are super hungry and not down to pay for an expensive buffet!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes and was extremely disappointed.  I think I just ordered a bad plate. The burrito had absolutely no flavor.  Don't think they even bothered to salt & pepper the potatoes.   Plus - we sat by the window with the morning sun glaring on our face and the bad tint couldn't  prevent us from feeling an extra 15  degrees hotter.  All the other food must be real good because it was a full house, and we had no choice but to sit there or have it takeout."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Vegas.  Love this place.  Can't go wrong with anything.  From there own brand of soda to the cookies at the end - just awesome."}
{"text":"So I took my daughter to lunch today and since I'm eating right and exercising I took my daughter to skinnyfats and the food was great and the healthy drinks were good also they had infused lemon and lime water you can drink and the dining area was fun and colorful we really enjoyed it and I didn't cheat so I felt good about my self I would definitely go again and take my wife!!"}
{"text":"Everyone has a bad day, so does every place. So I gotta update my review - I must say this is one of our favorite spots., I try really hard to try everything on the menu, they give you 10% off forever if you do try everything on their menu (they keep track), which is really cool. The healthy waffle is delish, I tried the Shroomin In philly which was really good, along side a strawberry lemonade and I'm set! Hope they open another one soon, it can get crowded."}
{"text":"THANK YOU! You're open right behind my house. Now I can walk or even crawl to acquire the best french toast I've had in years.   If you haven't been here already, GO HERE. They have a Healthy Side and the naughty, 'Happy Side'. I've tried almost everything, they've added some new things which is always refreshing. (Breakfast/Lunch all day, errday)  This place is going blow everything around it out of the water, hands down. Super friendly staff, always clean atmosphere, I am so happy!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and the staff is ridiculously attentive, super courteous, and always on point! Food is great, too."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious.  If you haven't been here please try it!! Healthy and filling. The one on Dean Martin Drive is small but very pleasant staff and not to long of a wait at lunchtime"}
{"text":"Great food. Hidden gem in an industrial area. Kind of pricey but worth it. I ordered the filet of fire with truffle fries. Steak cooked rare with great flavors and fried jalapeño rings. Awesome sandwich!"}
{"text":"Their food is incredible.  Prices are inexpensive.  The only negative is the location on Dean Martin Drive--seating is limited; so if you get there during the lunch rush, good luck finding a seat.  The menu has plenty to choose from for healthy eats as well as tasty treats.  Service is great and friendly.  I'd go to the place any day of the week no matter what your taste buds desire."}
{"text":"Well, to start out I found this place thanks to Yelp. Really off the beaten path, which is a good thing. We do not want to have to walk a mile for food or deal with the usual Vegas strip crowds. It was worth the hunt to find this little gem. We enjoyed it so much, that even though it was one of our more expensive meals, we had planned on returning a second time to eat here in the same Vegas visit (but we went home early instead)   The food is GREAT! I love the unusual offerings. I love that they give you both healthy and not as healthy options and tell you which is which. I LOVED the drink options and we really enjoyed the drink we bought and kept the cup too, very cute. The service was great and the people working there are very sweet.  So, why only 4 stars? Well, I kinda hated that it was such a small area to eat and we were stuck cooking in the sun while we were there. Every time a table would open up in shade, someone else would grab it and that's understandable, but you can see how it's time to expand right? lol  and the other thing was, I kinda hate that it came to $40 but I had no leftovers or that you don't get much food for your money. The only other meal I paid more for was AYCE sushi. When you are attempting to budget your meals, you want more for your money. That being said, I would rather spend my money getting good tasting healthy food and they deliver. You just gotta make eating there more enjoyable somehow. Second location?  We will return!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Friendly customer service and the food is fantastic as always. We got the fried cauliflower, basic burger and the cran-burkey.   The cauliflower was very good, but was not nearly warm enough but tasted great.   Although, as a person who moved to Las Vegas from Cleveland, the Stuff On Curry name is off-putting haha."}
{"text":"I really wanted to LOVE SkinnyFATS the way so many friends & family do but it just didn't do it for me.  I've been there 3 times & I haven't found that one thing that really sticks out for me to keep me coming back.  The 1st time I went, I had the chicken & waffles.  It was alright.  The chicken was seasoned & fried nicely without it being overly greasy.  The waffle was fluffy but that's where I had a problem.  It was almost too soft.  I had a hard time cutting it up.  It kept tearing & falling apart.  The idea was awesome & had the waffle not been that consistency - maybe more crisp - I would've loved it.  As for a drink - I ordered a mocha.  The 1st mocha I got tasted like burnt coffee.  No chocolate flavor at all.  I asked that it be replaced.  The 2nd mocha tasted like the 1st.  I got a bit of attitude when I explained that it tasted the same & I was in a rush to go, so I didn't bother asking for a replacement.  I just drank some of their complimentary fruit/veggie infused water.  The 2nd time I went, I had the red velvet waffle.  I wanted to see if all the waffles were the same as the one with the chicken...plus it's red velvet with cream cheese frosting - who doesn't want that, right?  That would be me.  The consistency was the same.  Too soft, kept tearing apart.  Reminded me more of a shaped pancake more than a waffle.  The cream cheese frosting was good but between the frosting, the chocolate chips & the waffle itself, it was a bit much for me.  This time I ordered a straight coffee so that the mocha incident wouldn't repeat itself.  It was ok.  Your regular coffee.  Nothing exceptional about it.  This time my boyfriend actually joined me & I tried some of his food as well.  He got a wrap from the healthy side & some truffle tries.  The wrap wasn't bad but the fries were delicious!  He got a soft drink which we were both impressed by.  We liked the variety of soda flavors & that it wasn't your typical fountain selection.  The 3rd time I went, I decided to try the drunken monkey pancakes.  I figured their waffles reminded me of pancakes so maybe they exceeded in the pancake department.  They were good.  VERY sweet.  Very rich.  The bananas, marshmallows, chocolate sauce & everything on top together worked better than I thought.  I could only finish 1/2 the order because of the sweetness & I think next time, I'd ask for no marshmallows (not a huge fan).  The bacon on the side was actually my favorite part of the whole dish.  Mmm...bacon.  The service was alright. Friendly (except for the mocha issue) & fairly quick given the fact that they are always busy.  If I had one suggestion, it would be to use BOTH cash registers when you're packed.  Each time I went in, there was only 1 girl taking orders/working the registers.    I'm sure I'll end up back there at some point.  Hopefully I find something I really love otherwise it's bacon, truffle fries & fountain drinks for me. Ha."}
{"text":"Love skinny fats.  I was introduced  to this place by a coworker years ago and I love it. Every time I go it's really packed so that's a downside even though I always manage to get a seat. I stick to my ultimate favorite but their entire menu is amazing and o believe breakfast is served all day. Try the Cherry Popper it totally work the calories. Im not sure if there is more than one location since I always end up going to the one on Dean Martin Dr"}
{"text":"Loved their juices, their breakfast was just ok. It was probably because I ordered from the skinny side of the menu. I had the protein waffle / turkey bacon / fruit. My food was not hot...the taste wasn't bad but if it doesn't taste freshly made, there's an issue.. My boyfriend's steak omelette was much better (and warmer) than mine. I think I just got unlucky with what I ordered...booo."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on the way home from the other side of town and was pretty impressed. It's menu is split between healthy options (skinny) and unhealthy options (fats), thus the name.  The left side of the menu are the skinny dishes and the right side has the fat dishes. The calories are listed on the healthy side, though not on the fat side. Some of the calories for the healthy dishes are ridiculously low. They also have vegan dishes on both sides of the menu. Prices are in the $8 to $13 dollar range.  This place is about as hipster as it gets. The walls seem to be made from re-purposed wood and the small dining area is full of the hipster crowd. This is the type of place that focuses on organic, local ingredients and serves their togo food in compostable boxes. It's a pretty casual environment, and seems like a great place to grab lunch.  I got the spicy filet mignon sandwich and my wife got the steak breakfast burrito. We also got the cucumber asian chicken salad as an appetizer. The chicken salad was the only thing we ordered from the skinny side of the menu, and it was delicious. The chicken salad paired perfectly with the cucumber boat it is served in and was made even better knowing it had such a small caloric impact on us.  The breakfast burrito was very good and smothered in a gravy sauce. My sandwich was pretty good to, but it wasn't worth $13 considering the serving size. The filet was tender but I felt like the sandwich would be just as good with roast beef for a few dollars cheaper. I also got the pita bread and hummus for my side dish and I loved it.  I found this place to pretty intriguing and I want to come back and try some more of their original dishes, especially on the skinny side of the menu. My biggest criticism is that their prices seem to be a little too high considering their portion sizes seem a little small, which seems to be the trend at hipster places.  If you want to try some original and healthy dishes, this place is worth checking out. As someone whose looking to lose a few pounds myself, I want to come back. It's the perfect spot for people to go where someone is on a diet and the other person isn't."}
{"text":"If you ask you shall receive.   So happy that the calories are now available for review on their website!   It's so hard to find a \"healthy\" restaurant in Vegas without paying an arm and a leg for, or without it being ruined with something so unhealthy. At skinnyfats you get the best of both worlds. Perfect for the dieter, and perfect for that hangover cure from your late night out.   After a hard work out I typically stop here and grab my lunch, I'm not shy to indulge in their healthy side as it is so delicious I feel as if I'm eating from the happy side! I have no favorites and I have no complaints as everything is delicious! The cute cashier with a quirky fun personality adds spunk to the dean Martin location. Although it's very small (and rumor has it they're looking to relocate to something bigger) it is the coolest eclectic place i have been to in Vegas.   Yummmmmmmm!!"}
{"text":"My first time here and WOW! I had the smother' d and it was delicious! Here is the amazing part. Took my nephews who can't decide on one place. One hates pasta the other eats very healthy so where to go? Skinny fats had everything to make them happy and the food was great! A++++"}
{"text":"This is a great local neighborhood restaurant. Something me and the family have been looking for. Off the strip, great food, and with an assortment of menu to choose from without paying tourist price$. The breakfast menu which is served all day is something I would go back for over and over again. Don't let the fosade fool you. It's hidden and surrounded by industrial building. It's totally a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Well at least my husband enjoyed his food. I really dislike complaining about food. I  feel like i am then \"that\" customer. I order the teriyaki filet bowl. It was drenched in sauce and the rice was under cooked. I think what upsets me more than the bad meal is the fact that no one checked on us. The restaurant was well over staffed, and no one checked on us at all. I ate 2 bites exactly, one piece of cauliflower  and one forkful of rice. My husband  took it up to them as we were leaving they offered to remake it but at that point I want to go find something else to eat. I didn't even receive a refund which seems like the easiest thing. I have eaten at the other location and enjoyed it. I won't be back to this location the lack of customer service is a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Food is great and filling. Juice is high priced(CA native), but generally so is fruit. We Live in the desert  so I understand!"}
{"text":"This is my new spot , creative menu I had a lot of fun eating here. Try out the French toast so bomb.. Cool local spot check It out"}
{"text":"There is nothing I love more than good customer service, and this place nails it! Everyone was so kind and helpful. On top of that, the food was delicious with prices you can't beat. This place has something to satisfy any craving, with healthy options, indulgences, and fresh juices. I had the Greek flatbread pizza and a frozen punch. My friend ordered a dish of buffalo chicken tenders, truffle fries, and ranch dressing. Both were super yummy and perfect portion sizes. Indoor and outdoor seating options."}
{"text":"So I work pretty close to this place and I stop in here at least once a week to get a quick bite. Ive stuck to the happy side of the menu and I have been pretty happy every time I eat there. The portions are filling and the people that work there are kind and upbeat. This place has a nice vibe to it and certainly deserves a visit if you're in the area for lunch."}
{"text":"the vegwich (aka portobello burger) left a lot to be desired. it was a however, the tu-nuts (spicy tuna in a cucumber boat) was literally one of the best things i've ever put in my mouth. i would come back based on that dish alone. the truffle fries were good, also loved the juices."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We stopped in on the way from the airport. Delicious food. Healthy and not - so - healthy options abound."}
{"text":"Skinnyfats is always good, and as a result, always busy. Try the burgers, sweet potato fries and the Slaw Chee. I'm not a fan of their breakfasts... The healthy breakfasts are very bland.This diabetic would like some lower carb breakfast options - everything seems to be pancakes and waffles."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas! They have so many options and everything I've tried here has been delicious. I really love that you can eat healthy or happy! It fits all tastes and diets!"}
{"text":"LOVED IT. Healthy, Happy, VERY hard to find a place that is healthy, good, quick, friendly, and tasty.   I'm here on business and have eaten here at least once a day since finding it. Excellent fresh pressed juice, great ahi cucumber boat, and everything I've tried has been great. I actually expect it to continue to improve along the way since they ask for feedback.  Wish this place was in LA..."}
{"text":"First I want to say their food is good. Working in an \"industrial\" area you don't have many options. For the area it definitely beats out the other few options. Our office has been ordering nearly everyday since they opened. They would occasionally mess up the orders, but small things ( no tomatoes , dressing on the side and so on.. ) not that big of deal. Then it started to really go down hill once they became popular.  Our office favorite is the \"Flat Chix & Greens\" . Which at first came with a side . Now it does not. Not the end of the world. They then raised the price a long with nearly everything else 20% plus. Then when you thought it was going to stop there they decreased the portion sizes. I got 4.5 oz of chicken today compared to the avg 7.5oz+ . I guess back to divine cafe :(  Ps. On multiple occasions \"Not believing it was being caused by the juice\" I have ordered their \"Mr.Green\" every time this has completely messed up my stomach . I have done multiple day juice cleanses and drink green juice regularly. I'm not sure what is different in theirs but it messes me up.  -  Update 9/4: Portion size has been consistent and fair."}
{"text":"Oh my lord! Let me just say straight fire!!! These guys have the best concept, a healthy menu, happy menu, and 4/20 menu. Just enough selection for everyone! Customer service on point with all servers having a smile wide on their face. My stamp off approval is here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go and eat they also have awesome juices. The salmon cucumber boat is one of my favorite things to order the place looks really cool and the staff is super friendly! They also have a great cookies!"}
{"text":"I hate that there is not one of these where I live.  My friend brought me here last year and now I have to come every time I visit.  My only complaint is that my stomach is not bigger to eat more.  I've tried the spudgetti (amazing) and the bomb diggity (outstanding)  Also, don't follow them on instagram because you will want to eat your phone.  I love that they give you the option of having something indulgent or something healthy.  Great concept and friendly employees."}
{"text":"Been here twice now.  The 1st time I ordered:   Sweet Cheese Us- sorry was not impressed.  Did not taste or see any meat.  It was tasteless and boring.  It tasted more burnt and charred then anything.  I threw half of it away.  Couldn't even bring myself to eat it and not let it go to waste.   Flat Chix & Greens- was good.  The caper vinaigrette (sooo good!) and balsamic reduction went perfectly with the salad.  I finished the whole thing.    2nd time I ordered:   Wrap Supastar-  looked really good but was also tasteless.  I had to season it with salt and pepper.  The chicken tasted like it was boiled, wish it had some flavor to it.  Luckily the cajun cliantro lime yogurt sauce was tasty so that helped.  Won't be ordering this again.   So far both my experiences has been just ok.  I would go back.  But next time I will order french toast, pancakes, or waffle.  Maybe the sweets will be better."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very cool and original menu items. The Slow Boat to China is my favorite. Small venues, so it gets a little crowded."}
{"text":"This is a great option when you want to have some quick dining in the downtown Summerlin shopping plaza! The service was fast and friendly and the restaurant was very clean. If you have never eaten here, they have two menu options. There is the skinny side which is the healthier side and the fat side which is the more indulgent foods. I tried the healthy option, the \"mean bean\" burger. They make the bean patty fresh in house according to the menu. It tasted freshly made, and was very flavorful. There was a nice spicy aoli on it, and plenty of ripe avocados. The truffle fries are delicious, and should be added to every dish! The only disappointment was the frozen fruit punch. It did not have the punch flavor that I would normally expect, that sweet and tanginess. It was like a frozen fruit slushie, I would skip this next time."}
{"text":"Closest thing to an LA style cafe that we have found. Love the multigrain waffles and pancakes with the added fruit."}
{"text":"We were at work & had Skinny Fats delivered. Never a disappointment. Loving the Wraps and breakfast options! I usually like taking my friends from out of town here!  Did I mention a secret menu? Love this place!"}
{"text":"Big thanks to the catering rep(Matt Rush).  We called the day before to cater a staff lunch, they told us to call the morning of and guaranteed delivery on time.  The online order registered as a pick-up order, so I called the location and Matt was happy to change the order to delivery, and it still came 10 minutes earlier than quoted.  The entire staff was quite happy with the food, and no one ate dinner because we were so full from lunch!  I got the Bomb Diggity, a fair sized sandwich, big cuts of bacon, delicious. The fried chicken and bacon sandwich was pretty huge and had to be finished at home.  One of the staff said she was dreaming about the Teriyahi that night.    Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"I can't explain how much I love this place! Just had the REDiculous and I'm so content right now."}
{"text":"I love the interior of the place! It's not too small compared to the other location by Town Square. The artwork on the walls are so pretty. The staff are really nice and friendly. They were also helpful with the menu as well. I usually get the Buffalo Chix and it never disappoints. The truffle fries are the best!"}
{"text":"I can see why this place has such good reviews.   The decor was nice. The interior designer was very cost effective and creative.  The service was good. They were very nice and attentive.   I ordered the naked Chix, sweet potato fries, and green mile. My friend got the chikhumm sandwich and truffle fries.   The naked Chix was delicious and the fries were perfect. The green mile is tasty but too sharp. It was not for me but I would definitely drink it if I felt like crap about my body or was bloated. The green mile makes you feel that all the alcohol, fatty foods, and bad gunk in your body will be cleansed and washed away.   My friend said her sandwich was good. I tried one of her truffle fries but I didn't see it as amazing. It reminded me of normal fries with salt."}
{"text":"Love skinnyFATS! The food is always good and the staff are always friendly. We moved to this side of town in July and have come here more times than I'd like to admit to! Early or late or just at a normal time, and I've loved it every time!"}
{"text":"GOOD Food is consistently on point!!  Try these....your belly will thank you. Classic burger, cranturkey, meltdown, garden treat, skinny fats punch, lemon blueberry cookie, supastar, smotherload, tunuts, slow boat to china, spicy latina... and BEER =)  The ahi srirachi tacos are still my favorite after all these years....been coming here before it was even hip at the dean martin spot... Thank goodness the warm spring location opened =)   BAD The flat breads/pizzas are weak...ugh   *I would luv to come here more often and definitely would, but it can get way too  pricey for 2 or 3 times a week...just saying =("}
{"text":"The food was delicious it has a uniqueness to the menus. I will definitely be coming back. The quality of the food is great."}
{"text":"Management contacted me right after my initial review apologetic and addressed my concern with the employee that made my experience less than pleasant. I decided to give SkinnyFats another try since I was reassured the issue had been dealt with. I'm happy to say my visit yesterday was nothing but enjoyable. The food was delish (as always) and the service was great from start to finish. I know every dining spot isn't going to be 100% perfect, but it's refreshing to know management cares enough to quickly nip problems in the bud once it's brought to their attention. I'm updating my rating to a 5 star just because of how my concern was handled. That in itself will keep me coming back (oh wait, the food too!)."}
{"text":"Meh- ok for the price.  My buffalo chicken bowl was on lettuce, and the lettuce was very bad, ruining the meal.  Would not go back unless out of other options."}
{"text":"The Charlie brownie shake was good but the chicken on the chicken and waffles lacked seasoning on the chicken and it was over cooked."}
{"text":"It was very busy and the place doesn't seem fully finished as there was still some construction outside, but not once did I second guess coming in. Everything was handled great. Food is good as usual, service as well. I'm used to the Warm/Springs/Durango location, but I have my new favorite restaurant in Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"Very nice place to get a quick meal. Great selection of food, along with fresh juices, coffee, etc. I tend to always sit outside no matter the temperature."}
{"text":"I have heard nothing but good things  about this place from friends so I had to check it out, the location is kinda hidden so make sure sure you keep a look out it.   Pros , new menu, fresh feel, cool decor. I love roscoes so when I saw they had chicken and waffles I had to compare. While theirs is tasty it just doesn't compare to roscoes. But if your in the health craze you'll love it, staff is also really nice and pleasant  Cons- it's extremely small. Seating is first come first served. So it's a  Little awkward trying to stake your claim to a table when the people are just getting up and leaving before it's been cleaned and reset.  Little pricey. But hey it's vegas what u expect? Lol   I will be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast at skinnyfats. The service was remarkable. Nicki was awesome and delightful. I also noticed that she was very helpful with recommending options to patrons who were indecisive. Everyone was very prompt. The food was delicious and very well presented. Stop by and try their special items, they are delicious! On a side note, I wish they would accept Apple Pay. Also follow them on Instagram! @eatskinnyfats"}
{"text":"We went to the one on dean martin the first time and staff told us about this location , great location with outdoor seating , great food"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere very friendly staff food at all-time high quality meals look just like they do in the pictures right in front of you tad bit pricey but not bad"}
{"text":"I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.   It took us a while to find the place because the sign isn't too big and it looks like a little hole in the wall. We passed by it twice until I realized that it was the place! Also felt kind of stupid because there was a HUGE billboard sign that said \"SkinnyFATS is here\"!   I was actually surprised because I didn't take the time to read previous reviews and only looked at pictures of the burgers rather than the inside/outside decor. The place is small! Felt very cozy in there, and it was a bit packed when a got there with a few seats by the window open and two tables. As soon as you walk in the line begins, and you place your order and then sit wherever you like.   I never understood why it was called SkinnyFATS until I looked at the menu and saw that one side was for those who wanna go a healthier route and another side for those with no limitations! There were two employees at the front and one acknowledged me and gave me an insight of the menu and what they had which was good! The girl taking my order was nice and helped me choose what to order/what would be the better option!   I ordered the cherry popper burger with truffle fries for my uncle and I got the classic burger with truffle fries and two drinks for us. The food was served to us shortly after.  If you're going to get a side, please get the truffle fries. They are AMAZING! The best I've ever had. Most restaurants will put too much truffle to a point where it overpowers it and you don't even taste the potatoes but these were perfect. The burger was just as amazing as the fries!! I wanted to buy a bottle of the chipotle ketchup but it slipped my mind because I was too focused on how good my food was.   Will come back as soon as I can to try their other options and also try breakfast! Very impressed with this place!!!"}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this place for a while and was so excited to try it but unfortunately it was a fail. I placed an order online and picked it up right on time. The food was ready when I got there and I drove home 10-15 minutes just to find that the food was soggy, and by soggy I mean dripping wet soggy. The take out orders are placed in a box and shut closed with a SkinnyFats sticker which made the box sweat. My boyfriends sandwich was soggy, his fries were even more soggy than the sandwich that he couldn't even eat them & the inside of the boxes were dripping wet. My burger was a little better but still couldn't eat the whole thing. I was so disappointed bc I really wanted to like this place but  seriously don't order take out from here......"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a trusted friend....so when we were in the area thought we would give it a try. We had two different flat breads. The flavoring was excellent but found the flat bread itself too hard making it difficult to eat without making a mess. Although I wouldn't order the flat bread again I would definitely put this place on my list for the next time around. Took a menu home to study as I want to be prepared for next time."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I placed my order to go and 20 mins later I ask where's my food & they say oh sorry it's been sitting here this whole time. Food is now old & if I wouldn't have asked they would have never called my name for the order. Very disappoint with their service."}
{"text":"Odd location but it works. Food is yummy and creative. Staff is pleasant and openly trying to work out the kinks of a new place. I go the good for you Cobb salad which was huge and very tasty. I'm very happy to see another place offering healthy choices and green drinks. Good stuff, I've been back twice since my first visit."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Tried SkinnyFats for the first time the other day. I was impressed. I ordered tacos, a tea and a cookie. Everything was great. Customer service was friendly. Great atmosphere inside with really cool artwork on the walls. Will definitely return to this place in the future. A+"}
{"text":"Small place with great food. There was 6 of us and we all shared different plates that were delicious. Service was great. Would defintely come back when I'm in Law Vegas."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go when I come to Vegas. The service is great, restaurant is clean, and every menu choice I have tried is delicious."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Dean Martin location but yesterday I came to this location because there is more sitting area. Food is always great when ever I visit SkinnyFATS. I got the VegWich with truffle fries. Best Truffle fries ever!!!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first -- but it's great! Good food and great space; will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is some of the best food to be found in the Las Vegas area and I ALWAYS go to them when I'm here in town. They have to locations with a 3rd opening. The food is great and the prices are fair.  I would love to give them 5 stars if it wasn't for the lack of tables and sometimes the long line. But if you don't mind waiting, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"This places was so fun! I loved that I could order healthy and my boyfriend had full fat options ;). The place is very small though...not a lot of seating. There were a lot of pre-seaters and people hovering over tables as  your finished up. They also ran out of coffee and the coffee came with the food. I prefer to drink my coffee before I eat, so that was kind of disappointing. I love the idea of this place though, I just wish it was a little bigger. I like that it's off the strip. It felt like a hidden find!"}
{"text":"Hated this place! There so much on the menu it's time consuming! It's a very small place with only 6 tables! The food was gross and tasteless! Def disappointed"}
{"text":"Talk about stupid problems. So after putting in an order for 2 burgers and fries to go I waited about 30 minutes and my food never came. So I approach one of the girls behind the counter to ask about my order and she tells me she would check. A little over 5 minutes later I ask again and they tell me they gave my order to someone else, then asks if I'd like to wait on them to cook my order. I declined because I was already running behind on my lunch break and they told me a manager would come and assist me. Another 5 minutes later nobody new comes out of the back and one of the girls asks me for my card to give me a refund. I will never spend money here again."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to come check out this well talked about establishment and try out their food. The atmosphere was very chill and relaxed while the staff was friendly and helpful.  I had the Buff Chix while the hubby had the Mean Bean and both tasted very good. We also shared a Charlie Brownie shake which was a huge hit especially with our toddler.  My reason for the 4 star rating is because my food although delicious it came out cold. It could have been due to being one of the last patrons inside that evening.  I'm down though for going back and trying more stuff next time!"}
{"text":"Their chicken & waffles is disappointing for $12. The chicken was generous & moist but was bland.The waffles was small but taste wise was good (sweet how I like it).  This was supposed to be a sweet & salty flavor combo but turned out as sweet & Blah. I'm a regular & most of the others I've ordered I liked.  this is the first time i got the chicken & waffle. Some that I like were their classic burger, ahi tacos (either healthy & happy side), ahi teriyaki sandwich. And as always, truffle fries are excellent.  If you're craving for chicken & waffles, I'd recommend Black Bear or M&M southern kitchen.  Better price & better tasting.   This review is only based on the food ordered tonight.  We got it to go but I know from experience service wise, they are excellent."}
{"text":"Love the name... SkinnyFATS. =D (it's like when I try to eat healthy but I'm a fatty at heart). Lol, gotta love food. Healthy or Happy choices here!!  Not only is the name creative, the food was spectacular. They have something for everyone, from smoothies, juices, burgers, sandwiches, breakfast, appetizers, salads and sides. You can opt for a healthy veggie side or go with some yummy truffle fries. You can have an all fruit drink to an awesome 100% cane sugar soda. As for me, well I took the fatty route and went with the fries and soda.   I ordered the steak eyes. (2 biscuits, with 2 pieces of steak dipped in a country style badder, 2 pouched eggs, and sausage gravy) omg, it was bomb!! The meal is very filling, and could of been split. I couldn't even finish it and I left stuffed. The biscuits were soft and moist, the steak was a good and tender, the eggs were on point, and the crazy was flavorful. I highly recommend this breakfast choice, especially for the egg Benedict lover.  My wifey ordered the filet o fire. (Filet mignon, avocado Pico, jalepeno spread, on a garlic Texas toast) She loved it and was very impressed for being a sandwich. The truffle fries were good and reminded me of Gordon Biersch garlic fries. Yummy. We also ordered the yummus (hummus with pita seasoned in a lime sea salt). Every bit of both meals were perfect and delicious!  The workers were friendly and helpful. The food was amazing, the interior was roomy and nicely painted, and the cups were cool take home souvenirs! Check this spot out while in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"First, I would like to say that I have always wanted to try SkinnyFATS for a long time! I had heard so many good things from my friends and it's something that is healthy!    That being said there were two things I really wanted to try: truffle fries and chick-a-waff-a-dopolis (chicken and waffles). Happy too say I got to try both because I went with friends and we sampled eachothers!  I had ordered the chicken and waffles and was not disappointed at all! It looks small but omg! It was so filling and had so much! The chicken was so tender, it was cooked to perfection.   My cousin order the buff chics which is buffalo chicken strips! That was so good and she had truffle fries which are the best!  My other two friends ordered sweet things like the drunken monkey cakes, which is super sweet, big, and delicious, (it has bananas and marshmellows!) and unBRIEleviable, which had berries and Brie. I love Brie! Such a yummy brunch with the girls! I can happily say I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened I was curious about it, but not enough to go in. My  mom  rented a space for her salon business in the same plaza as this restaurant. after seeing it being so busy every time I visit my mom I decided to finally check it out. Oh man, this place reminds me so much of Frisco(San Francisco) which I grew up at. The place had smiley faces and it was so colorful. It's like walking in height street and bringing back so many memories. the service was great and the employees actually refer you to your name and not sir or ma'am. Awesome place and awesome food. I'm definitely going to be a regular here!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato pancakes were bomb! Definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Stuff-on-Curry was just the right amount of spice. The corn was a sweet addition and the shrimp was perfectly seasoned and cooked. My boyfriend got the Melt Down; he loved the spicy aoli and was very happy with his meal. We got cookies to go; the peanut butter cookie is amazing! It has a gooey middle and is so yummy. Staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"The food is good here if you want something healthy or happy (not so healthy).  The last time I came in I was trying to have the least amount of carbs and I usually get the naked chix that comes with rice. The guy at the register suggested for me to substitute it for cauliflower rice.  I was hesitant as I don't really like cauliflower but I was SHOOK at how satisfied I was with it.  Now that is the only way I get it!"}
{"text":"The second time I came in, I tried the Cherry Popper. The cashier asked me if I wanted to add avocado and bacon, and I decided to give it a try. I ended up paying $17 for my meal alone, but honestly it was worth it. Wait time took longer than we thought, though you can't blame them during the lunch rush.  The only reason I'm docking a star is because they forgot to add the bacon and avocado that I was charged for. I was so hungry that I just asked to have it on the side, and I'd put it on the burger myself.  Other than that, this was probably one of the best burgers I've had in awhile. The flavor was right on point. I'm not a a big fan of peppers but they complimented the burger so perfectly.  Glad I gave this place another try!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and fresh. I will have to return to try other tasty-looking options. I ordered from the healthy side and tried the \"cluck moo\". It was very flavorful."}
{"text":"Great food, we picked meals from both the Happy side and Healthy side. We sat ouside because we brought our little dog, she sat quietly under the table, very happy.  This is one of our favorite places in Vegas, we are never disappointed here."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The staff is awesome! This was our first time in and when we told them the girl was so cute-- \"we love new customers because we love to explain the menu\" -- and I loved that we weren't an inconvenience because we were new... But they enjoyed us.   Thought we knew what we wanted and went to the counter to order, but we were surprised because they had awesome specials. The girl at the counter explained the specials and showed us the pictures and I immediately ordered the chicken Panini because it had pesto and that's like heaven to me.   Food. Was. Amazing! My sandwich tasted like it came from some swanky over price placed. I inhaled it, so good. Sweet potato fries, yum!   Everyone was friendly, came over to talk to us, and everyone had their favorites to suggest. I love that. You can tell they love what they do.   When we walked out everyone thanked us and all said goodbye, I felt like I left a friends house.   I will be back FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"What the F\" is this 35$ for 4 tacos that had no flavor with truffle fries with no flavor. And  5$ for two water's my god im in the wrong business.\" Wow\" VEGAS doses it again what happen to taking care of the locals.Should have gone Fat Burger at least I wouldn't be hungry."}
{"text":"Great service!! Super welcoming when we walked in, even for early in the morning. Great atmosphere!! So much more room than their other location. More seats, more tables. Great for hanging out with friends and fam. Amazing food!! Same great quality as their other location. Never disappointed when I go here!!"}
{"text":"Flavorful healthy options. The place gets crowded so place your order online if you're ordering for takeout. Get there early to beat the lunch rush if you want to done in. Who knew healthy could taste so good?"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is incredible. Everything from the taste and presentation of the food down to the decor. I love the idea of having healthy and indulgent options at one location. I ordered the Cluck Moo and my husband ordered the Wake N Bacon. My healthy option was full of flavor and only 400 calories. Our kids devoured the Cinnutella. We will be coming back tomorrow to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Surprisingly small and delicious restaurant built into an office park. Just one street away from the strip they offered a large selection of unique and interesting items.   From healthy /trendy options such as chia bowls to hearty egg and meat staples, it was very satisfying. Highly recommended for a brunch spot, but stick to small groups as the seating is scarce."}
{"text":"Great place. Wow... I had the Mean Bean and it was really tasty. My husband had the chicken & waffles and raved about it. I definitely would come again. It's a small establishment and gets packed quick so get here."}
{"text":"Good eats. Haven't had anything I don't like yet. A bit crowded at lunch but you can't fault them for being popular."}
{"text":"One of the best places I ever been , awesome food , super friendly staff ! Definitely on my 10 bucket list foods of the world ! The place also give you a possibility to eat healthy or not so healthy , doesn't matter if you are on a diet or not .  Trust me , you going to have one of the best experiences of you life.  Please guys , had to Miami as soon as possible , see you guys in the next visit for sure"}
{"text":"Amazing! My favorite meal is the Nice to Greek You with the special fries! Their cookies are also excellent!"}
{"text":"I love the food so much! But the prices can be a little shocking. Today I am trying out the vegan dish mean Bean! I hope it's as good as all the meat dishes!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! No matter what I order I've never been disappointed. The staff is friendly and very helpful. Quick service. Overall good spot!"}
{"text":"The food is really great with so many options... In my first visit I did find the menu confusing and to be honest had no idea what I ordered. On subsequent visits I learned to Google menu items and that helped a lot..."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!  I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup, the ultimate in comfort food, and it was so good! Filling and delicious and even on the healthy side ;) Good selection of healthy and cheat meals on the menu and a relaxing dine in environment.  Definitely my new go to spot for good food that is good for you!"}
{"text":"A hidden little gem. Everything was absolutely delicious. Definitely a go to spot from now on."}
{"text":"This is probaly my go to munchie spot.  My fiance had the patty melt. She let me have a couple of bites and I fell in love. We had the fried pickles which was off the hook tasty. I myself had the hoagie. The hoagie sand which didn't have as much meat as what I'd usually would put in mine at home. I wouldnt order that hoagie again but say hello to the patty melts cant wait to come back for more amazing deliciousness. The place was pretty crowded but we managed to find a couple of seats. Oh ya they got the tastiest sodas ever black cherry AND creme omg I wanted to take 2 liters home. Anyways 2 thumbs up! Let me know when you add extra meat on the hoagie so I can get it again."}
{"text":"I am not especially a fan of healthy food or even less vegan, but I'm currently following a diet to try to lose excess weight before à family wedding in July, so, I figured skinnyFAT seemed to be a good option during my business trip in vegas! We were 3, and all 4 dishes we ordered were exquisite! I had the teriyahi sandwich, a divine ahi with a delicious teriyaki sauce and spinach, between 9 grain sesame bread! With some \"cauliflower rice\", which is rice carved from cauliflower, it was just delicious! And only 430 calories ! At the same time, I tried my friend's zuch'it bowl, a dish perfectly seasoned, perfectly spiced, for me who loves spicy food! Everything seems delicious in that place! I will get back there as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"Amazed how SkinnyFATS is able to cater to both healthy and \"happy\" options.   Love the truffle fries and cauli flower in buffalo sauce. I also like their pressed juice because it is so refreshing!"}
{"text":"Perfectly clean, amazing food,  engaged employees constantly doing something well and on point with customers. Cool vibe.  Definitely the bomb. Quality of food out of control and totally creative. Big community table wastes space and I don't like waiting for a regular table."}
{"text":"I love this place and am glad they have another location besides the one on Dean Martin! This location is more of a \"hangout or kick it spot\". The location on Dean Martin has a warehouse feel to it.   There is a Skinny \"Healthy\" Menu (for those who are dieting and those who are health conscious about what they eat) and a Fat \"Happy\" Menu.  I love going here with friends because I'm usually that one person that is dieting or \"tries\" to eat a little more healthy that when going here I never feel bad because both me and my friends are happy. Yay! :)  I love the Ahi Sirachi Taco (3.95)- it was a light Ahi Tuna Taco over a wheat tortilla that had slaw chee, mango pico, teriyaki sauce and spicy-yo aioli sauce. The sauces are perfectly zesty, spicy and sweet. I did not feel guilty or overly full after eating two.   I also recommend the Slow Boat to China (6.95)- it is an Asian chicken salad served in a \"boat\" made of cucumber. Containing the same sauces in the Ahi Sirachi Taco- teriyaki and spicy-yo aioli sauce. Pairing both entrees would be great for a meal!"}
{"text":"My favorite whenever I want something healthy. There are so many choices on the menu.. Skinny side or the Fatty side.. my all time favorite is the Teri-Ahi!! I love it from the buns to the sauce in the sandwich. If you don't know what to order, you must try this!   The location is easy to find and there are many parking spaces. Try not to come during rush hour or there will be a line... the space is decent, not too big or small.."}
{"text":"I've been back here a few times. They have 2 options. The healthy side or the fatty side. Most of their sandwiches are delicious! My favorite one is the Teri-Ahi. It's so good! And fries are also good as well."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS has a really great concept. We ordered multiple items during our visit and their flexibility with substitutions makes this establishment overly desirable. This place is a great place to visit if you're sharing so you can get a little bit of everything! They also sell items varying from breakfast to burgers so you can really come here during all hours of operation.   The only downfall is its random location and size. It was really difficult to find since the sign is on the smaller side. Since it was also really busy, it was hard to find a a spot to sit.   TIP: Order your dressing on the side when ordering a salad"}
{"text":"Skinny fats never fails to amaze me. No matter what I've gotten, ( I've been here way too many times) it's soooo delicious!   This time I got the ahi taco San and the ahi srirachi tacos. Always delicious! Tuna tacos with mango pico, sriracha aioli and slaw. The healthy version is served in a wheat taco and the happy one is served in a puffed shell. If it's your first time getting them, I suggest one of each :)   Also got a hold of that secret menu and ordered the Fat fries. Those fat fries though... If you love garlic and cheese; you'll love em! It's their garlic truffle fries, smothered in bacon cheddar sauce. Then topped with pico and a country fried small filet on top. I thought that it was super different to see a mini steak piece fried on top of my fries. I enjoyed it!   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this out while I was visiting and wished it was back in california! I loved the artwork and very chill vibe. I got the TATS and absolutely loved it. It worked really well for my friend and I because she loves to eat happy and I love to eat healthy!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. I had the S'motherload and my boyfriend had the Stuff on Curry. Both were great. We also had a Snickerdoodle cookie, which was...okay. the soda options are some weird brand and the diet soda didn't taste right. It wasn't worth it to get a drink at all. The dining area is small and we had to wait for a table to open up only to have someone move an extra chair to the end of a table next to us making it so my boyfriend could barely move, let alone get up to leave the table. Overall, it's definitely a take-out place, because the ambiance and space set up is subpar and super cramped. The food is worth it."}
{"text":"It was very confusing especially because it was our time there. We came in and it was very busy and we didn't know if we needed to be seated to order. But food was great!!!!! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"HEALTHY OR HAPPY   The menu has 2 sides: HEALTHY and HAPPY. Breakfast menu served all day!!!  The reusable cup: 100% top shelf dishwasher safe.  It's very cool since it has Happy Meter, ranging from OVERJOYED, HAPPY, GOOD, OK, BUMMIN', SPIRALING, AHHHHHH.   FOOD: Chicken Waffle (HAPPY side): crispy, tender, huge portion, warm  DRINK: They have all kind of juice to choose (HEALTHY side) or soda fountain (HAPPY side).  AREAS: They have 2 (two) areas: inside area with big fan, and outside area decorated like picnic area.  SERVICE: fast, friendly.  ATMOSPHERE: Big TVs were playing sport channel, walls painted different colors and some spots with happy face icons.  What I'm unhappy is the fact that the cashier was asking me on the spot when I were ordering if I wanted eggs on it and if I want to add sriracha on top of it without telling me how much each of those adds-on going to cost me. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend. Perfect for families with mixed preferences. I got the meltdown while my daughter got the tu-nuts. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this place. I going to go even as far as saying that it's my favorite place in Vegas so far.  I've had their gluten free flat bread \"Berries the Steak\" ($9). It was absolutely delicious. Just the right about of sweet and tangy. I loved it so much, I ordered it every time. My bf has tried the \"Nice to Greek You\" ($7) flatbread and liked it, but if you don't like olives, there's olives in there. He also has tried the \"Cherry Popper\" ($12) burger with the hawaiian roll and egg in it and he claims it to be one of the best burgers he's had in Vegas so far (We've tried Bachi already). My friend had the infamous \"Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis\" ($12) aka chicken and waffles and it was extremely delicious. Super tender chicken and flaky crusting. I've also tried their fresh juices and they were pretty kick-ass. I just thought they were slightly overpriced (ranges $8-9.50) which is pretty much the price of my meal.   SkinnyFats has not disappointed and they have very friendly and attentive staff. Food is very well priced. I'm super excited they are going to open a new location in SW soon! They really needed that because seating is limited at their main location. When you get there, find your seat and you order at the register. Plenty of parking and located in a commercial building area.   Another advice for SkinnyFats: would love to see more gluten free items on the menu because I want to try more than just the gluten free flatbreads you guys have! You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"If any place deserves five stars it's Skinny Fats. Love the healthy food here and the decor is great. The staff is always very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Customer service, environment, a huge communal dining table, outdoor seating, AMAZING food (that's also healthy)! Definitely recommend, very impressed."}
{"text":"The line to place in order goes extremely slow. It's not entirely the cashier's fault. Mainly people waiting until the very last second to decide what they want, however, they should have two cashiers instead of one, especially on busier days like Sunday's.  Asked for the steakation but requested to have the sandwich with sourdough bread instead of the multigrain bun. Still got the multigrain bun, a sad amount of meat and aioli, fries were soggy, and to top it off there was a long piece of blue hair in my sandwich.  Needless to say, not going back."}
{"text":"Wow what a gym this places, the food was Vantassel dick the atmosphere was nice but get there early or you'll be waiting in line for at least 3540 minutes. The place is small so it's hard to get a table unless you go early the prices are a little high. But the food was worth it, give skinny fats a chance and I guarantee you'll go back"}
{"text":"Delicious menu options with a variety of \"healthy\" or \"happy.\" The happy side are your glutinous options and your healthy side are more waistline friendly, without forgoing the taste."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm. They have a healthy menu and a fatty menu - i opted in for both and got their special, Steak and Flakes with their SkinnyFATS punch. My boyfriend got the Cherry Popper burger, which had a super thick patty which was super juicy and filling. He even got a side of fruits to make our lunch a little healthier. My special isn't on the menu, but on he screens on their counters but the cashier. I really liked my order because the fries had the perfect seasoning of salt, crispy and thin. The beef had a kick of chili flakes on top, but it was flavorful with the poached eggs. I had one of my poached eggs overcooked which was disappointing because i wanted the oozing goodness all over my fries and beef, however it didn't ruin the meal. I'd totally return for the same dish if they had it on their specials again. He punch was 21oz and deliciously paired with my heavy meal.   Seats are first come first serve and they have a few more seatings outside. Worth trying!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. I have tried something new every time I come and have never been disappointed!!"}
{"text":"It's hip, it's fresh, it's...SkinnyFATS! The menu offers \"Happy\" and \"Healthy\" options (God forbid those two ever go together...). Both sides feature an abundance of delicious options. Soda fountain is a unique selection, and they craft juices as well. Service is solid, if unspectacular. Decent spot to take a date."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING!!!! I've been here twice. The first time I got something off the \"healthy side\" and the second time I got their chicken and waffles and I was in heaven. I would recommend this place to anyone I know. The portion sizes are huge. It does get busy and its fund your own seating but it worth it!"}
{"text":"Super good!! Cherry popper burger by far on my top 5 best burgers ever tried.   The fries?? Amazing   Highly recommend the spot"}
{"text":"went to the new location today....Lets start with first impressions....the interior is well done....definitely representing their long theme and good food with a giant happy face taking center court....this reminds me of something you might find in San Francisco...the menu is ,as usual, different,creative and tasty....the service was top notch...the food is not cheap but you get what you pay for...on the subject of price i went to order 2 orange juices for me and my dad....16 dollars wtf? i dont want to buy a whole tree just the juice..anyways just got water with lemon instead...that price rivals Buckingham palace...work on it..besides that i wish they had one in downtown Summerlin..but it appears they are working their way around the valley,or i presume the rent at DS is really off the charts otherwise why build in this location? i really didnt mind the drive but would be nice if it were 5 minutes away rather then 30. other then that i purchased 2 of their super cute coffee mugs....also this place has about 10/15 times the seating capacity of the one on DM which is very nice....worth the trip and the money...good job SF's :)"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch with the girls. My fat friends can eat fat things and my skinny friends can eat skinny things. The world is a happy place. Kind of expensive, but quality cost."}
{"text":"I gave SkinnyFATS another try and I really liked their red velvet waffle with chocolate sauce! It was such a good waffle and I love how they added cream cheese. I also tried their Green Mile pressed juice which tasted super gingery."}
{"text":"Got a salad and truffle fries..   The salad while small was good the perfect amount of dressing. But you don't even get a full chicken breast it's half a breast..    The fries were terrible. They were old and almost stale the only fries that tasted like truffle were at the bottom which leads me to believe the just poured a little on top and didn't toss them. Truffles didn't have a strong smell or taste so im guessing it was any eye drops worth..   I don't know why people flock here because their door is open you have to eat your food fast or its cold. I'm assuming because half the people I see walking in the door are women and half those women are overweight... So put skinny or false sense of healthy in the name and you've made a hot spot for certain women. Smh"}
{"text":"The register was down so the meal was on the house! Great service. If you are in Vegas and want Healy options, go here. The zoodles and turkey malls were great!!"}
{"text":"How this place has such great reviews really boggles my mind. Do the people from Las Vegas have a much lower standard for quality? My boyfriend & I came here for breakfast before going to the movies last weekend. There was a large line, which I didn't mind because I assumed the food would make up for it. I ordered the drunken gypsy toast, which was pretty good, however I had asked for a side of turkey bacon, and they gave me pork bacon, which I do not eat, FORTUNATELY I could tell before taking a bite. My boyfriend ordered the 3 Happy Chicks, which SHOULD have been called the 3 RUNNY Chicks! The eggs were so undercooked they might as well have left them in the shell! There was yolk all over the plate, covering all the other food. In the middle of attempting to eat, I told the staff 1, my drink never came & 2, they have me pork bacon instead of turkey. They brought me my drink, but never my bacon. I asked my boyfriend how his bacon was, he said to salty to even eat. The only good thing about this place is that our dog got a huge goodie bag when we got home."}
{"text":"The absolute best $11.43 I've ever spent on lunch.   Hadn't tried it yet, but everyone in my office has been buzzing about it for months - I decided today was the day! Ordered the Portobello Mushroom sandwich (Shroomin in Philly - these name are comedy BTW) w/side of truffle fries. Mushroom sandwich was divine because the flavors meshed together so well, and it was not soggy. There was even some feta in there which gave it a kick! I'm not a fan of too much feta too often, but this small was surprisingly delicious.  But these truffle fries....! No words. They're soft and oily..but in a good way. Not heart attack oily, but healthy oily! (Or so it seems) Definitely my favorite new fries in town, and that is not an exaggeration.  The only things that irritated me was that the coffee seemed illegitimate (so I didn't get any) and getting there the first time was awkward because maps makes you take weird streets. And it's in a busy industrial center. Make sure to CALL & ORDER AHEAD!! It will save your life."}
{"text":"Food was simply amazing.  I was in Vegas for 2 days and went twice. I went to Vegas for a friends wedding and happen to see the place on yelp and decided to go for dinner first night we were there. We learned why places called skinnyfats..they have one menu with healthy items and another not so healthy. Genius idea!!! We ordered tacos and pork sandwich that were unbelievable.  It was so good we had to go again next day.  We went for breakfast and had egg white and chicken wrap and wheat waffles. Again beyond delicious.  I only wish they would open another location in Long Beach, Ca because it is something much needed in this area."}
{"text":"Great place good food. Came in a party bus with out my shirt they made me buy a shirt but what ever the food was really good I'd definitely come back"}
{"text":"Food is interestingly good. Quirky place that certainly is pretty good and holds up to it's name Place is really really small and it's so popular you're more than likely gonna have to battle it out with someone for a table. Not for big parties ,good for a couple people or maybe a family of 4."}
{"text":"Gosh, I feel bad to give it a 2 star.... so I'm giving it a 3 star.  This isn't for me place.  We've been here a couple of times.  The first time was because of the rating... than the second time was a few weeks ago.  My friend really wanted to eat here.   My memories of this place is...... The music is way, way too loud.  I can't even hear my own thoughts.  LOL.  Seating is the worst ever.  It's borderline annoying.  The first time, we got a table and it was dirty so we moved to another table....it was dirty too.  I had to ask twice for someone to come clean it.  It wasn't too crowded.  Not sure why the guy was not having it and said to me he's got it, after I waved down someone else to clean it since it's been like 5 minutes.    Food is whatever.  We ordered a burger, chicken tenders and a salad.  Burger looked delicious, very messy to eat and it was ok....It made me crave the Carl's Jr Guacamole Bacon Burger right next door, that's not a good sign.  Buff chix was alright, I'd had better.  The salad was a salad...  Coffee is crap.  I really feel like this place is one of those IG spots, where everyone just goes here to be seen as they eat healthy...order food take photos and don't even eat it and leave.  It's not cheap here for whatever food and their portions are smaller.    Hopefully I won't have to come back here to eat."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this place has a very weird location. When this place started up, it got a lot of hype, mainly thru the social media sites. This joint is located by warehouses and factory offices, which seemed a little out of place.   I decided to check this place out with a very good friend of mine. Upon entering, I noticed that it's not your typical restaurant. It's a little too congested for my liking with very little room to move about. The tables felt very cheap and light and the chairs aren't sturdy. More so, the place was jam packed when we went.   Skinny Fats caters to a niche' which seem to belong to the health conscious, gym goers and people that are watching their weight. While they try to market all these \"healthy food\"  and various substitutes, I can't help but notice that most people that eat here are either gym rat elitists or the annoying calorie counter snobs.   The first thing that caught my eye is that the prices are crazy expensive, especially for the size portion that you're getting. I understand that you're paying more since they \"supposedly\"  use \"healthy\"  ingredients but $9 bucks for a smoothie? Definitely gonna be the last time I'd order something like that. My friend ordered a salad with some chicken and a blended shake which cost her $20 bucks.   To be fair, this review is more on the atmosphere and the vibe that it gave me rather than the food itself. My friend enjoyed her lunch so ultimately, I guess that's what counts.   I definitely won't be a regular at this place but would I come back? Sure, I'd be down to give it another go. Maybe my perception will change but until then, it's an overpriced health nut food joint in my book..."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The food was so delicious and the coffee was on point. I got the wake and bacon and it was enough to fill me up for most of the day walking around on the strip."}
{"text":"I love skinny fats!! My boyfriend and I got two turkey bacon sandwiches- delicious. Subbed the fries for fruit and salad both very yummy. We shared zucchini pasta- tasted like something my dad would make- we added chicken- one of my favourite dishes here."}
{"text":"This tiny lunch spot is definitely worth checking out if you're in Vegas!! Small dining room area and window bar seating.. friendly staff.. easy to read and understand menu. Staff offers up really good suggestions   Their menu is split down the middle with \"Healthy Side\" and \"Happy Side\".. both sides of the menu had really delicious options .. including vegetarian options! Order at the counter and they bring your food to the table.   On today's visit I enjoyed the More Cow Bowl ($11.95) with teriyaki filet mignon, portobello mushroom, cauliflower, bell peppers and served over egg fried rice.. colorful bowl and so delicious!!   The favorite lunch special seems to be the Cherry Popper burger ($12.95) with a fried egg & pepper marmalade.. served on Hawaiian bun.. my coworker enjoyed it!   I hope to come back to this spot on my next trip to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"If you've never been to SkinnyFATS, then you're probably in for a treat. At least that's what Toni and I thought after walking into the Warm Springs location. At first walking into the two front doors felt like we had just been transported into a friendly neighborhoods backyard, complete with friendly greetings from the staff and chatty tables all around. If I could pinpoint a feel to it, it would be the, \"Casual California Weekend Backyard Meetup\" feel. There was also an outdoors section which was a welcomed sight to see, complete with backyard wood fence and comfortable seating between both sides.  The walls are colorful with wood boarded styles. The staff is clearly visible working the meals and making sure they go out within reasonable times through a kitchen half window. The front counter shows the large selection of funny titled selections, including sections that clearly distinguish between healthy conscience choices and the equally awesome listings by the simple color and title columns of \"Healthy\" & \"Happy\".   In between Toni and I getting the cleverly hilarious food titles and possible movie references, we wondered on how the healthy and happy choices actually differed, but then we just looked at our hungry faces and shrugged and ordered what sounded good to us. There were several choices, most of them with their own sections and categories between sandwiches and bowls and even breakfast sections and pressed healthy juices and desserts.  On the drinks side, we were surprised with the lack of usual labels only to be equally excited about trying some real cane sugar sodas. Something that is usually overlooked until you try to scratch the recesses of your mind and picture something similar or better than the Jones sodas you randomly had growing up, then combining that with all of them being different flavors coming out of a soda fountain. Our minds were blown as we were recommended by the lovely cashier to try out and mix \"Cream Soda\" and \"Black Cherry\" and we just let it happen. I had one of the two unsweetened (I'm diabetic) iced tea flavors and some of the cucumber iced water.   Toni decided on the \"Bomb Diggity\" - \"applewood bacon, lettuce, tomato, lemon herb aioli on sourdough, sandwich.\"  that came with some \"delicious\" sweet potato fries on the side. I'm not sure if that was due to us being hungry or the sandwich just being that good but her only complaint was that the bread was a little rough. It's sourdough, it was meant to be a little rough around the edges, it's not the bread's fault.   I decided to go with the \"Hot Chix\" salad bowl. \"Chopped buffalo chicken, bleu cheese, pico, avocado and fried jalapeno strips over romaine tossed in a buffalo ranch.\"  Clearly the winner here for healthy choices. Not only did I get the awesome taste of some well-cooked seasoned boneless buffalo chicken nuggets tossed with greens, but the blend of ranch and avocado presented in such a way that was inviting and not just clearly tossing my salad (apologies). As far as condiments, They had their own signature sauces which were flavorful and delicious on specific plates, but I had to give them props for including the rare green habanero hot sauce. Though the food was amazing on it's own, I love me some spice as well as flavor, and the 3rd party habanero hot sauce was a definite welcome in my book. Tapatio would have been my second choice instead of Cholula.  The portions were great and the music and atmosphere complimented our mood of just feel good eats and laid back Bob Marley-like chill tunes. If there was anything else I would have changed, it wouldn't have been as balanced as what they have done with this well-liked and awesome location.   The Good * Great original food and drink selections * Laid back atmosphere and music selection * Service with a genuine smile and decent order to table times.   The Bad * Only 2 locations (Dean Martin and Warm Springs)   Bottom Line SkinnyFATS is a place for great original food at pretty decent prices without all the bling and glam of the inner city. You just head there with the mentality to kick back, enjoy some happy & healthy dishes, drinks and bring some friends as they will most likely thank you for it. Just make sure they return the favor the next time they suggest heading out anywhere. Toni and I loved it and we will definitely be making the Warm Springs location one of our favorite spots in town."}
{"text":"Definitely a sweet little place to have a quick lunch.  Staff was courteous and the place was nice."}
{"text":"First timer was fantastic can taste the quality of the food. Breakfast burritos wraps truffle fries everything was superb.Hats off the amazing crew working there. I completely spaced on asking for her name I do apologize . I had accidently ordered to the other location and instead of just sending me away she offered to call the store on my behalf and cancel my order while getting a full refund as well as recieving the food I had originally ordered in less than 15 minutes . They are definitely setting a standard for customer service."}
{"text":"Awesome place with really nice people and great food.  They are always innovating and coming up with new dishes, most of which are fantastic. There have been a few duds but out of dozens and dozens of dishes I've tried, I've been very pleased. Everyone is always friendly and smiling, you can tell that their culture means a lot to them and it's awesome. The fountain drinks are some weird bottling company and taste funny, they should change that to a regular coke/pepsi machine (preferably Coke with Coke Zero.) Definitely a little pricey for a \"fast casual\" type place, but the ingredients are always fresh and it's worth it."}
{"text":"Very small location, they are expanding though. You will think you are in the wrong place but the huge billboard will tell you otherwise. It is in the front row off the plaza, to the right of the billboard.  Same delicious food as the other locations. This trip our table had smoke in a bowl, the meatloaf sandwich special and the Benny special. Don't forget the frickles!!!!  Always get the frickles. Lightly breaded, you get a crunch and get there pickle flavor. Most places bread so heavily you don't know you're eating a pickle.  Smoke in a bowl pleased as usual.  Meatloaf sandwich had mashed taters on it. Was very tasty and quite the mouthful.  The Benny was over a fried backed potato which was my last favorite base of any of the Bennys I have had so far. The flavors worked well together. The poached eggs was a solid yolk, this seems to be standard, out of the five Bennys I have had across the three locations I have had one runny yolk.  When we were leaving my aunt bought a box of cookies. Rather pricey, but I won't pass up a cookie of someone buys them for me. Some hits and some misses. For the phone they should be shrouded in gold. I blame Starbucks for the expensive coffee and cookies in the world."}
{"text":"Love the variety of foods. A lot of the healthy options beat the happy options hands down. Of course I will come just for the frickles!"}
{"text":"Exactly what the name says. Depending on how you're feeling, go healthy or indulge. Either way, delicious and the staff is A-1."}
{"text":"Neat concept of happy/healthy menu, but items like the Ahi Sriracha on the healthy side aren't entirely healthy.  Although savory, it had sweet teriyaki sauce that didn't quite go with the dish and the spicy aioli sauce drenched on the plate defeated the purpose of clean eating, as are most of the items on their menu.  The skin on the chicken and waffles was crunchy and seasoned to perfection.   Not kid friendly in the sense that there is no SPACE for kids, tables are packed tightly and you're literally bumping chairs with other tables.  There's a wait to order your food, but the staff is honestly probably the best part of the restaurant.  A bunch of young kids with great attitudes.  Bottom line, would go back but not go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"This place has great healthy food! There's also some other not so healthy options that are delicious, so whatever you are craving, they have it. The cucumber yogurt shake was incredible. And I love the truffle fries and slaw chee! The names of the dishes are clever too, like Brussel Crowe, haha."}
{"text":"Save enough time to thoroughly go over this menu.  Sooooo many great healthy or happy choices available.  Also take a peek at the off the menu items, there are some gems there! I'm going back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. My boyfriend and I are regulars and every menu item on either side is tasty as heck. I think that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but there IS something to suit everyone and they're more than happy to accommodate any special requests. I love the ambience and the staff is incredibly friendly! And while it's not SUPER CHEAP it's totally worth the extra few bucks, especially compared to other establishments in the price range."}
{"text":"The red velvet waffle is delicious! Country fried steak and eggs, just as good.  Can't wait to go again and try something new."}
{"text":"I love being able to come with my family here for breakfast/ brunch. It is a really small place so With 3 children and 2 adults it is pretty tight if it is remotely busy.  Otherwise... the food is great! I love the option of healthy or happy. Hahaha I was very happy having a \"healthy\" breakfast. My coffee was nice and hot and there was free refills.  We will be back! My whole family enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is beyond delicious!!! Health and taste amazing.. You get such a great vibe when you walk through the doors. And their chocolate chip cookies are to die for"}
{"text":"The staff is so friendly and nice. It is super crowded and hard to get a seat but well worth it. Foodie heaven! They have a healthy side on the menu and a less healthy one. Yumm. Go there. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is the best place if you're indecisive to get healthy or fatty food. Simply because they have two options it's either healthy or fatty. Not to mention when I walked in everyone greeted me and were very nice which made me feel extremely welcomed. The young lady at the register helped me decide my order and the food was everything that I expected, SUPERB!"}
{"text":"This is not your traditional breakfast place, they are very creative with their breakfast items. They serve breakfast all day. They serve eggs Benedict on the weekend and they are a must get, it's served on a buttery biscuit and it's so good, I think it's similar to the steak eyes.  They have fresh ingredients and the flavors are great. Their decor is made with recycled materials and it's very interesting. We also tried the cheesy risotto balls which is great to share. The portions are large so we didn't get to try too much. Would come back next time to try their sweet breakfast items."}
{"text":"I love this place! As do many others because I never see this place empty. This location is near my house and I probably go there at least once a month. I love that they have the option for a \"skinny\" (healthy) menu and a \"happy\" (not as healthy) option. In addition to food they also have a juice bar you can choose from. This way you are able to decide what is best for you that day and you are able to go with others that may be looking for something different than you because of their variety of menu options.  The last time I went here was on a Sunday due to the fact that each Sunday they create a new Eggs Benedict and sundae. I love that they have weekly specials that you are able to try out. We got there just in time because after we ordered a large line started to form. The Eggs Benedict of the week was eggs with mashed potatoes and strip steak with a demi-glace and cracked pepper hollandaise. The sauces on this were incredible and I hope they have this special again! The Sunday Sundae this week was a ice cream cookie sandwich with nutella buttercream on top. I mainly wanted this because I am in love with anything Nutella and it didn't disappoint.   In addition to Sunday specials they also have many other specials you can find on their instagram or by stopping into the venue and looking at their special board next to the cash register.   I will be back for many more Sunday specials!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised, food was delicious.   The truffle fries could use some fresh Parmesan sprinkled on them but other than that I was impressed. I'll probably stop here again in the future as its right next to the archery range that I frequent."}
{"text":"Was able to come back and try and few things with Julie t. This time I got the steak eyes and shared. As usual the portions are super large. I actually really enjoyed this item. The country gravy was very rich and flavorful, the batter outside of the steak had a nice seasoning and the steak itself was perfectly medium-rare.  I asked for eggs over easy and they were. nice and runny.   Also tried some truffle fries which were pretty good.   Not all items on the menu are winners as I learned in my first few visits. I'd personally avoid the chicken and waffles all together until they change their recipe for the chicken. Way too bland.   I'm avoiding the juices in the future. There's nothing wrong taste wise but I just don't see the value in them and I prefer to make it myself at home for 1/10 the price."}
{"text":"My husband's philly cheese steak sandwich with truffle fries were delicious.  The vegan zucchini dish I ordered was over salted and the flavor left something to be desired.  The cider and stout beer were both tasty."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is overrated very mediocre. My happymess fries were just ok. My friend had the wrap superstar and both were lacking flavor. Very good service though. Just not amazing food"}
{"text":"The Decor is very urban hip love the details in the bathrooms.  Everything you have ever wanted to make with a pallet of wood is done in taste.  I have eaten here several times and the food pure quality and has that rustic farm to table touch. Great menus for kids not to mention the specialized sodas. We were lucky enough to be the first to try their cold press cocktails. A mixture for fresh juice & booze so you don't feel like your being bad.  Try the filet o fire if you like a good meat sandwich.  Hipster are welcomed."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I had the berry protein waffle and hubby had the steak eyes. Glad to have a new breakfast alternative in the N Decatur area! Bonus: mimosas & military discount as well"}
{"text":"Interesting concept and menu.  Fun and cute decor.  Very helpful and friendly staff.  Don't come at lunch expecting a wide range of lunch items...your choices will be pizza, burgers, a few sandwiches or salad.    The menu has more breakfast type selections...waffles, pancakes, breakfast burritos, wraps and eggs...whether they be off the healthy or happy side.  The Neato Burritto was fresh and tasty.  The Fresh Morning Sandwich was okay.  The Truffle Fries were very yummy.  Quite honestly the menu was confusing so allow for a little more time to study all of your options.  I overheard about a \"secret menu\" after we ate and I have no idea what is on it, but maybe you want to ask about it.  Also there is quite a following here so expect a line to order and possibly a wait for a table."}
{"text":"Really nice place if you are looking for sg healthier option. I had the slow boat to china, which was ok, my husband had the smoke in the bowl and that was really tasty. The staff are really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Not located on the strip but definitely worth checking out if you're not afraid of a little adventure off the beaten path.  I'm lucky to be friends with girls who love brunch just as much as I do. So we all decided to give this place a try! We took the taxi here and though it wasn't the cheapest ride (approx. $30 including tip for a one way trip from our hotel on the strip), it was the last thing on our mind after eating an amazing meal at SkinnyFATS.  Between the four of us, we ordered the WTFrench Toast - a delicious french toast with turkey patty, cranberry sauce, arugula & spicy berry marmalade ($10), the UnBRIElievable Brioche french toast - french toast served wit brie, basil, strawberries, and a rich balsamic glaze ($9.50), and their special of the day, BACON POT PIE BENEDICT ($12). Both french toasts were equally amazing. The WTFrench Toast was fluffier and lighter, yet it still managed to pack a mean punch of awesomeness. The UnBRIElievable was more sinful - french toast was perfectly fried to a golden brown color and the combination of the brie and balsamic glaze gave it a richer taste that excited the tastebuds.  But the winner has to go to... *cue angelic music* the bacon pot pie benedict. I've never had anything quite like it! It's not a dish you want to eat all by yourself... but I definitely ate 80% of it. The dish comes with a miniature pot pie stuffed with diced bacon pieces, potatoes, peas, and carrots. On the side, it came with one egg Benedict and a large fried jalapeño stuffed with a mystery stuffing.. that was just as amazing!  So... have I convinced you to try this place out? (:"}
{"text":"I loved this place. The vibe, the staff and the menu. Was definitely cool. My friend who lives in LV decided to take me here because it was relatively close to my hotel and I had gorged enough on the amazing food on the Strip. We went into Skinny Fat and one side of the menu is a little more health focused while the other side was pure artery clogging heaven. I was a little disappointed to find out that the fryer was down. Skinny Fat didn't want me to be great. But I instead ordered a salad that was pretty amazing and a grilled chicken sandwich that was equally fresh and tasty. Will definitely come back for some truffle fries and to try out more awesome stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"1st time here and it was delicious. The atmosphere was fun and family style. I enjoyed the Hot Chix salad and it had just the right amount of kick. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Went here the other day, SO GOOD! I got the classic burger and it was cooked perfectly. Everything tasted very fresh. The staff was nice too. I'd definitely recommend to others!"}
{"text":"A place where you can order anything off the menu and know something wholesome, satisfying and made primarily of whole foods will be in front of you in minutes. Some of the menu items have the calorie amounts which can be really helpful for those trying to make better choices. There are also vegetarian and gluten free options to most items."}
{"text":"Came here and had their Sunday special that week: fried chicken over two mini waffles with an eggs Benedict toppled with applewood bacon, tomatoes and onions. It was super good! Great mix of sweet and savory for brunch time! I also had the liquid defense and that was a good compliment to my meal. Loaded with orange, lemon, basil, and carrots- light enough to drink (not heavy like a shake) and you get your vitamin C in!   Only thing I would comment on is it was really busy so the food took a little longer than expected.   But overall awesome, and if I have a free morning/afternoon ill be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The concept is so simple yet so ingenious...to have a menu that can please those who are eating healthy and those who crave comfort food is one that many restaurants need to adapt to. On top of that, regardless if you go healthy or gluttonous, both foods are absolutely delicious!  I got the chicken and waffles and my friend got the veggie burger, and we both cleaned our plates; I wish that I hadn't been talking as much while we were eating so that I could savor my food more. They have a variety of drinks from cocktails to cold-pressed juices which they serve to you in a very cute reusable cup. The restaurant itself is a bit small on the inside, but they have a nice patio seating area open when the weather is nice, the meal in its entirety was just so satisfying and I was craving the food again the very next day!"}
{"text":"This is the best one stop shop for a diverse crowd. They have a healthy & indulgent menu. I love coming here. I finally tried the HotChix salad & it was amazing!! perfect portion & equal amount of toppings!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast when I was in Vegas last weekend. The menu has a healthy side, and a \"happy\" side for the not so healthy options. Super cool concept but let's face it - I have no self control and would never voluntarily choose a healthy dish over a happy one. I had the fried egg on top of country fried steak & biscuits - seriously genius. I love biscuits and gravy, and I love country fried steak - it was like this dish was made for me. Shared the cinnutella pancakes and those were so damn good too. It's not a place I would HAVE to visit whenever I was in Vegas (like oyster bar is), but still a 5 star breakfast to me."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonably priced.  I don't know what they do, but the bread on their burgers and sandwiches are the best....  It's kind of in a weird location, business area close to the airport.  If you eat outside the aircraft landing overhead is pretty loud.  I would definitely eat there again.  The only CON is the dinning area is pretty small, but the place is very clean and the staff was very personable......"}
{"text":"My first time at this location. I walked in and the person at the register was ready to take my order. The menu is extensive(healthy menu & tastier menu) with a lot of details, it's probably best to know exactly what you want so you don't hold up a line. I ordered the chicken and waffles (chick-waffa-dop-lis). We sat down and it was packed(Sunday afternoon) but we managed to get a seat indoors. There was an outside portion but the seats were taken. I received my ordered after about 10-15 minutes. The presentation of my order was great. I felt the chicken was more on the tougher side, but overall I was good but not great. I felt it was a little overpriced as well ($12.00). The atmosphere was relaxed and the interior decoration was impressive.  Service was straight forward. I will definitely be back to try other items on their menu. Maybe I'll go for something on the healthier side."}
{"text":"This review is LONG overdue. My boyfriend and i came here back in September and WOW. This place is GOOD. The quality of food, the employees...everything was soooo bomb. We're definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"This location is at Downtown Summerlin. Everything here was fresh. Their side salad comes with baked garbanzo beans instead of croutons which was a nice touch. It also had apple slivers to give it a bit of a crunch. The buff chix plate was enough to share between two people. About 10 buffalo chicken strips. Very spicy, but full of flavor that packs a punch. The ahi seared tacos were paired nicely with a mango salsa. One from the healthy and one from the happy menu. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Recent Visit March 4, 2015 (6 Visits to date) Food - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Cleanliness - 5/5  Overall - 5/5  Great place to go with friends if your looking for something healthy or something that makes you happy. This is one of the few places where it is actually somewhat pricey but I still enjoy going to it because I really like how the food is prepare and tastes. I normally sway away from places like this that charge a premium for the \"healthy\" niche but SkinnyFat does offer a great variety of selection that can help you be more health conscience but still maintain the flavors in the food. You don't have to sacrifice flavor for health.  The menu consist of a Healthy Side and a Happy Side. The menu mirrors each other meaning the items are closely similar, just varies a bit on ingredient choices and portion.   --------------------------------------------Food - 5/5-----------------------------------------------­­­---- Healthy Side!  VegWich - $10  Very delicious sandwich with portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, jalapenos, banana peppers, spinach with some horseradish yogurt as dressing.  This was something that my friend got one visit here and I came back to try it out. It was absolutely amazing, I never though I could enjoy a veggie sandwich that much especially when basically a mushroom based sandwich.  The dish has minor kick from the banana peppers / jalapenos and horse radish, sweetness from the tomatoes and the well seasoned mushroom creating a flavorful dish.  Skinny Q - $7.00  I ordered this the first time I came to Skinnyfats. It was late at night and I wanted a item that wasn't too heavy right before bed. To my surprise, this was very flavorful. The grilled chicken on flatbread with red onions, peppers, and cheddar lightly dressed with BBQ sauce and Ranch had the perfect balance of tangy and sweet. Highly recommend this if you are craving for pizza and want a healthy alternative.  Slow boat to China - $7.00  Late at night once again after exercise, we decided to stop by for dinner. I wanted something very light once again and I thought the name was funny and ordered it. I was reading the menu item and it listed this as \"Asian Chicken Salad & Slaw Chee in a cucumber boat w/ almonds, teriyaki & spicy yo-aioli\"  For some reason I was thinking it was a salad, but it actually came out to be a full cucumber topped with asian chicken salad and the listed ingredients. To my surprise, I never knew a cucumber can be made into a full meal that was quite filling and delicious. After eating it, I was quite impress on how creative the chef was in creating this menu. It is not my favorite item on the menu, but I would recommend it for those that want to try something new or eat something light. It's basically a giant cucumber with dressing and chicken.   Happy Side!  Meltdown  - $12.00  Two 1/4lb patties with caramelized onions with cheddar and spicy aioli on sourdough. Once again, patties were well seasoned, the mix of flavors from the sicy aioli and caramelize onions mixed perfectly with the patties and bread. It was a very well though out dish and quite yummy if you are looking to eat \"Happy\" tonight.  Special Item - Mac and Cheese   I decided to try out one of their special items that was on the menu that one day. It was basically a giant bowl of Mac and Cheese with chicken friend steak like meat. (Wasn't exactly sure what it was). I am a big fan of Mac and Cheese and decided that I will spoil myself that night. It tasted great in the beginning but you start realizing that it was a lot of Mac and Cheese and got kinda boring as you kept eating it. Not a highly recommend item on the menu, but it was still very tasty. ----------------------------------------------­­­Service 5/5-----------------------------------------------­­­-- Service is great, employees are very helpful in helping you make a decision on the menu after it could be quite confusing your first time. The employees are very up beat and seems to embrace the companies culture.  --------------------------------------------­­­Cleanliness - 5/5--------------------------------------------- Very clean atmosphere, great for lunch, dinner or get together with friends.   Overall Great experience and great food every time. It is one of my favorite places to go in the southwest with friends. Normally stop by there for dinner late at night when we want to have the option of eating a bit cleaner, or a great location during a lunch break. Also with the creative menu, there are always items I still want to try."}
{"text":"Was extremely excited about trying this place because of the reviews and the closeness to my house. However I was disappointed, I had the chicken tenders and waffle and my son had the kids burger and fries... Everything was room temp except the chicken tenders which were amazing... The waffle, burger and fries were just ok to me my son only took 2 bites of his burger and he LOVES burgers. The place was very clean with a cool atmosphere and awesome staff which is why I'm going back to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I finally understand all the hype about SkinnyFats after my first visit last night. The restaurant is appropriately named to describe the menu exactly. On one side, you have a healthy (skinny) variety of choices, and on the other, you have a plethora of happy (fats) dishes.  Both sides have some seemingly delicious choices, but for me, happy always wins if I'm eating out since I always eat healthy at home.    The restaurant itself is tiny, with about 8-10 tables total that seat 2-4 people.  Don't expect to be able to have too private of a conversation with your dining companions as you will be as close to the table next to you as you are to each other. In addition to the tables, there is a bar that is lined up against the wall as you walk in with maybe 8 additional seats.  You first order at the counter and pay for your food, then they give you a number that you can set on your table, if you're lucky enough to get one, so they know where to bring your food out. I've heard this place is chaos at lunch, but since it was about 7:30pm we were able to get a table as soon as we walked in.   Onto the food!  Chix on Broadway w/a side of sweet potato fries ($9.50): This massive chicken sandwich is not your ordinary plain dried chicken breast on a bun. Ooooh no.  This is much much more.  The chicken breast is lightly breaded and deep fried and so massive that its ends stick out of the delicious soft brioche bun by at least an inch or two on each side.  It's topped with w/cheddar, lettuce, bacon, tomato, red onion & lemon aioli.  This sandwich is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  The chicken is tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned.  This was by far my favorite of all the stuff we ordered. The sweet potato fries are thin cut and perfectly cooked.  They weren't out of this world, but still yummy.  5/5  Cheeseburger Benedict w/a side of truffle fries ($10.50): Everything about this burger was great, but it wasn't mind-blowing like the Chix on Broadway. It tasted like a good burger.  The egg yoke created a bit of a mess but my bf liked wiping it up with the bun. The truffle fries were good, but they just tasted like regular fries with a bit of garlic on them.  4/5  Smoke in a Bowl ($9.50): My friend ordered this from the healthy side. The flavors  of everything in it would make it seem like it should be bursting with more flavor, but it was just ok. It had big chunks of bbq chicken mixed in with pineapple, brown rice, peppers, onions, salsa, and cilantro lime yogurt. 3/5  The staff was really friendly and personable.  Our food came out fairly quickly and they were also quick to clean our plates off once we were done eating.  I'm really excited to go back. Hopefully I'll be able to resist ordering the Chix on Broadway again so I can try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"I found SkinnyFATS to be just okay. The food is good, but these are dishes I can easily make myself at home for a fraction of the cost. BUT I guess I can understand the hype.  The food is just complex enough that people who don't cook a lot would consider paying the price for. It's good quality and all very well put-together but if you know anything about cooking, you can easily eat on that level every day.  We went in for lunch on Monday and it was busy but not overly packed. We were able to order within 10 minutes and got a table right after. Fiance ordered smoke in the bowl and a soda, and I ordered the naked chix.  We also ordered a chocolate chip cookie to share. The bill was a shocking $26. The service was great and we got our food pretty quickly, but again for that price I was seriously like, I could've just made us this exact dish at home. I guess it's worth it if you're feeling lazy and just want a good healthy meal out and about.  Also, I liked the Naked Chix way better than the Smoke in a Bowl. Much better harmony of flavors. The bbq sauce on the Smoke in a Bowl was a bit bland. We had added avocado but it didn't go well. We ended up putting the avocado in my bowl of Naked Chix and it was much better!  They served us the chocolate chip cookie warm, which totally hit the spot with the sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"I give this place a solid 3.5 rounded to a 4 for being such a hip and cool place to eat. It is so hip and cool, it should really be down at the Container Park or near Zappos.  People - The people working here are so cool.  Music - The music is awesome.  Menu - Very expansive and requires some studying and many items on the menu are unique and quite creative.  Location - Odd at at best.   Prices - Fantastic prices.  Quality of Food - Darn good and very different!  Quantity of Food - Just about right. Some humongous burgers.  Nutritional Value - This is why they get a minus 1.5 star.  No nutritional information on their food. No known idea on grams of sugar in their foods, or even the carbs, or the cholesterol.  They talk and create a menu that has many buzz words that sound health like add protein, cauliflower, broccoli, kale, yogurt and all.  Again, all great stuff, howver, we all know that the amount of sugars in any of the sauces can be absolutely off the charts.  I did ask the staff about nutritional information and their answer was a bit odd.  \"We serve healthy food and happy food. It is all on the menu.\"   I will be coming back for sure, and at the same time, I would urge everyone to be very careful as you need to be careful about the fact that there are a lot of healthy items on here and at this time, just not sure if it leads to a healthy recipe.  NO matter what, great tasting stuff for sure.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed!! I let the cashier know that i have a mushroom allergy, and the even wrote on the outside of the container \"No mushroom\" I started to eat my meal and there's a huge slice of mushroom underneath my veggies!! Guess this place doesn't take allergies seriously! Will proceed to write corporate office has well! Will post picture to see what I'm talking about"}
{"text":"This little diamond in the rough off the beaten path was perfect! The Spicy Latina with the grilled cheese sandwich was amazing, the cane sugar cream soda was refreshing to wash it down. And just when I thought it couldn't get better, the chocolate chunk cookie was the salt sweet party in my mouth! The hostess and waitress were welcoming and kind. We will be back next time."}
{"text":"Pretty pricy food but last time I was here it was pretty good. I got the cucumber lemon shake and it wasn't that great, I thought it would be smoothie like but it was more shake like. Their truffle fries are a must!"}
{"text":"Moment of silence for the FAT cookie!  This restaurant is so busy it took me two attempts at separate locations before getting a seat. I was so overwhelmed with the menu and line I opted for a BLT and and a huge delicious cookie!!!  My total was $9.00 very reasonable and I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Always feel so welcome from the moment I step through the door. Staff is amazing, and shoutout to Patrick for the outstanding service!"}
{"text":"Delicious and staff always friendly and helpful! Only downfall is when I go it's always packed but it's so popular so what do you expect :))"}
{"text":"Wickedly good food . . . Skinny Fats lives up to their name. The menu is split in half. The left is the \"Healthy\" side and the right is the \"Happy\" side. All the food is excellent.  I had the Balsamic Bleu bowl. The steak was fantastic. Piled high on spinach salad, this was one of the most satisfying meals I've had in the last twelve months.   On the negative side, the restaurant is amazingly small. When ordering, you can get your food to go or gamble that you can find a table. You'll have better luck planning on getting your food to go. Despite the volume of business, there is only one order taker and cashier. You can wait 20min just to order at lunch time.   The front office staff do a phenomenal job. The kitchen staff, however, have room to improve. During the extraordinarily long wait time, I saw the front counter staff dump three fully prepped meals in the trash because they weren't correct. I saw two more meals sent back right from the service counter.  Granted, Skinny Fats charges enough money to do this. Nonetheless, it's disappointing to see this kind of food waste just because the kitchen can't follow the food orders (otherwise this would be a five star review)."}
{"text":"This location is very small and only offers seating for about 20-25 people.  Be ready for battle!  Most of their dishes are better when consumed immediately (the no soggy zones in life are slight glimpses of the promised land).  This is definitely not a place for group outings, and although high chairs are offered for the babies (looking out for those new parents), it's not the ideal setting for them.  I recommend driving out to the Warm Springs location because it offers more space.  Now let's get into the food!  The dishes have always been a hit or miss.  Some keep me coming back, while others are a one time experience.  The Yasssss:  $10 Chix on Broadway (Happy): Breaded chicken tenders cooked to a crisp thrown in some brioche and topped with cheddar (mo chedda mo betta), red onion (make it grilled), BLT and lemon herb aioli!    $3.50 Ahi Srirachi (Healthy): seared ahi thrown into a wheat soft taco and topped with mango pico de gallo and spicy yo-aioli.  3 of these bad boys make the perfect meal!  Great mixture or sweetness and spice!    $7 Buff Chix (Happy): breaded chicken tenders tossed in buffalo sauce.  The tenders are served over truffle fries.  It's hard to go wrong with tenders.  The chicken was still nice and juicy after being breaded and fried, but not enough sauce was provided.  Upon request, I was provided more sauce.  The fries are very thin and nicely seasoned!  I vote yes!  $10 Wrap Supastar (Healthy): grilled chicken, spinach, avocado, pico de gallo and egg whites wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla!  The wrapped burrito is drizzled with Cajun cilantro lime yogurt and some more pico is thrown on top.  The ingredients say breakfast, but this hits the spot any hour!  Everything harmonizes well together!    The Pass:  $12 Chick A-Waff-A-Polis (Happy): the waffle is a nice size, but is very dry.  It's on the thicker size, so one would expect differently.  The batter leaves much to be desired.  The fried chicken was dry and therefore lacked taste.  A side of syrup was the only accompaniment.  I recommend going elsewhere for this dish.    $11 REDiculous: the red velvet waffle lacked flavor.  This waffle was extremely similar in taste to the regular waffle sold and leaves one to assume that food coloring was the main addition to the batter.  The waffle was dry and left much to be desired.  The cream cheese frosting and chocolate syrup complimented the raspberries, strawberries and blackberries that were use as toppings!  The berries are large in size and in all honestly the stars of the dish, followed by the applewood bacon.  The waffle should be the main star of the dish for the listed price, so I vote pass!  I do have to compliment the restaurant on its customer service.  The entire staff was very friendly and attentive.  This little place can make for a very pleasant experience if the right dish is ordered so I recommend trying it if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Came back  a second time at their second location and was more pleased with my food.   I ordered the Steakation on whole wheat on the skinny side. All in all, the sandwich was great. I definitely need to go again and if I order it again I will definitely add egg as a friend suggested.  The truffle fries were a bit disappointing. Reading the reviews were what sparked my interest to order it. Hopefully it was just a fluke but my order had very little truffle oil in it. I've used enough truffle out myself to know it. Flavor was faint and the smell was not there. Will definitely give it a try again next time I come.   Oh yes. The juices are always great!   And the second location has outside seating on the side of the building. Ideal location for summer outings. Shade! :-)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Pimp Shrimp was the best. Great food in Vegas. Not that far from the strip."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere. I had the Cherry Popper Burger and my BF had the Meltdown. We left full but not stuffed and we'll definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"I'm rating five stars because the food is like high key good and because they have a staff member there that looks like Hozier and he's hot. Anyway service is excellent and staff is so attentive and nice.   But like if the hozier staff member sees this hit me up with that number ;-)"}
{"text":"Ate here at 9am on a Sunday morning. Small restaurant but wasn't uncomfortable. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. I got the AvoTofu bfast sandwich. Pretty good, my boyfriend ordered the blueberry yum yum which tasted amazing! It has a citrusy flavor that's so good. My aunt ordered the wakin bacon I think it was called and it looked pretty big! Looking forward to coming back to try the French toast."}
{"text":"If you love fries then you will love the Truffle Fries! They are absolutely amazing. Every time I come here I try to order something different. And every time I do, I'm never disappointed. The vibe is also what brings me back every time."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! Can I just say that this is my new favorite spot. I tried the Ahi tacos with mango coleslaw and I was floating in foodie heaven. I couldn't find anything negative about this place. I am looking forward to try other things but highly recommend. Customer service is amazing and very friendly. You can tell by the wait that people love this spot!"}
{"text":"I like it here :) good food, good choice and very creative. You can choose either fatty food or Health food, take your seat and have a delicious food :)"}
{"text":"Stepping out of my comfort zone has never tasted so good!!!  Who knew orange juice mixed with basil, carrots and Apple would taste SO GOOD (Liquid Defense)!  Well worth the few extra bucks you'll gladly pay to have your taste buds awoken!  Haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"It's an unassuming small restaurant off of Dean Martin street. You will miss it if not paying attention.   If you want a variety of good healthy eats to tasty fatty foods this is the place for you. The menu ranges from healthy juices, smoothies, and non carb dishes to truffle fries.   Hubby and I had the flat chix which was white meat chicken topped with baked corn, onions, and arugula. This sounds very healthy but is delicious.   We also had the Vegwich. This is a sandwich with portobello, avocado, tomato, peppers, and spinach. It's quite spicy but so delicious. Plate came with fries.   I'd definitely come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"So many people hyped this place up, but I was not too impressed. Besides the long wait on our food(wasn't even that busy), I had the s'motherload which was filled with way too much pico de gallo. That's all I tasted in this! The breakfast menu is just ok. I think this place may be better to eat at, at night or maybe lunch."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the menu and the food quality was amazing. Small place with lots of people but I'm heading there again for lunch!"}
{"text":"The menu is awesome.  The location was walking distance from my hotel.  Honestly, everything was excellent.  I had the Healthy and Happy sides of the menu, and I came back always wanting to try something new.  The only juice I had was the \"Beat It\" and be advised that it comes out as it goes it.   This restaurant is definitely on my top places list.  I wish it was a national chain!"}
{"text":"I came in here not knowing anything about the establishment.  The girl behind the counter was extremely helpful in guiding me the right way.  All I said was, what's your favorite thing on the menu that makes your tastebuds go insane.  Her response was, \"More Cow Bull.\"  I tried that fish for the first time, and I'm absolutely hooked.  It's a small bed of rice topped with filet mignon, peppers, onions, and a teriyaki/steak/unbelievably good sauce.  If you are looking for something that is absolutely outstanding, go with the HAPPY side, and choose \"More Cow Bull.\""}
{"text":"Brought my girlfriends to try this place when we landed in Vegas and they did NOT disappoint!!  Just didn't realize how crowded busy they get but I should have known given it was Friday at noon! :)  Two of us got their daily special sandwich which was their salmon parm hoagie... OMG the bread was so light and the salmon cooked perfectly - big and juicy with lots of parm cheese and that tomato sauce!!  I was SO stuffed but it was SO GOOD!!!  My girlfriend loved her teriyahi - which is seared teriyaki ahi tuna with a citris slaw on 9 grain bread... so light and tasty - paired with their awesome sweet potato fries!!  And the last dish was the Thai Cobb which is a salad with their perfectly cooked warm teri-salmon with romaine lettuce, mango peppers, bacon and a yummy sunny side egg!!  I wish I had enough tummy room to eat that TOO!!!  Service as usual was AWESOME... they are so good to clean up the tables right away and will help get more chairs to so everyone is seated.  Wish they had a bigger space but we made do!!  Another MUST go to place when visiting Vegas - there's so many dishes I want to try that I saw other people eat!!  Come to Cali SkinnyFATS!!  close to Cupertino PLEASE!!??"}
{"text":"Skinnyfats has an awesome menu that features healthy options as well as items that cater to your inner fat kid. The line was longer than your average order at the counter type of spot, but it moved fairly quickly. People are constantly in and out, so we didn't have a problem grabbing a seat after we ordered even though the restaurant stayed busy.   I had the Meltdown burger with a side of truffle fries. The fries weren't as packed with as much truffle goodness as I would have liked, but they were nice and crisp and good nonetheless. As for the burger, a flavor explosion is what occurred in my mouth you guys. It was so delish and I would go back for this juicy patty topped with 2 cheeses and grilled onions between slices of sourdough."}
{"text":"Food is good.  But nothing extraordinary that I'd come back for.  Moreso on a whim type of place. Or if I want a juice.  Place is aiight"}
{"text":"Got my food as a pick up.  A little soggy, but that's what I get for ordering instead of eating right then and there.  The meltdown is a must!  So good.  Get it without tomato.  But it's bomb The right amount of protein I wanted."}
{"text":"Great Environment. Great Food. Great Price.  I have been here a few times now, and I am always pleased. When you walk in, the set up is very relaxed, with the booth seating, the bar top seating, and the lounge feel of the patio outside. Everyone is very helpful and cheerful as well.  The food choices are very unique, SkinnyFATS basically means two different type of meals. On one side of the menu you have the Happy side, which is the food that isn't the best for your slim diet, and tastes amazing. Then you have the healthy side, which is obviously more of the leaner selection, and also tastes amazing, and the price can't be beat for the quality of the food served.   Also, they update their menu, and are very social media active for comments and feedback, to always improve to provide the best experience possible.  Very reliable place to go if you are into a relaxed place, great food that is priced well, and great service!"}
{"text":"Healthy vs. Happy (how about both?)  I really love looking at the Happy side of the menu lol but when my dad go the healthy side I was a bit jealous...I was just looking at the colors and I'm like really? Technically my dad got the healthy version of my version. He got the fresh morning sandwich (Egg whites, sautéed spinach, turkey bacon, tomato & agave ketchup on a honeywheat roll w/fruit ) and I got the chipper morning (Scrambled eggs on Brioche w/Applewood bacon, cheddar, tomato, avocado & spicy aioli w/SF potatoes ) Though mine was good...I just couldn't help looking at his...so sad...What's funny is that my dad ordered the truffle fries and that was pretty good too probably because the day before we had parmesian truffle fries from somewhere else that wasn't that great.  My mom got the drunken monkey cakes..Buttermilk pancakes, maple glazed bananas, graham crackers, marshmallows, chocolate w/Applewood bacon Oh yeah! that was just off the charts good...lol I mean this made me sooo happy! :D  This place is a little hard to find. I mean it's so easy when you know where you're looking. The sign is a bit small and you think you're in the wrong place just because it's not on the strip nor any where you would think a restaurant would be. It's like in the middle of warehouses. The guide is too look for cartoons! or happy faces? lol"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful but the best part of my experience was the service this morning at the Dean Martin location. It was incredible. Impressive even. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend ordered the Cherry Popper Burger well done. Cashier talked him into getting it medium well because \"you can taste the flavor better.\" Burger came out somewhere between rare and medium. Not what you'd hope for if you prefer your burger well done. Major fail.  I ordered Berry The Steak and there was barely any meat on it- just a couple quarter sized pieces if that and I couldn't even taste it. The bread it came on was fresh, soft and delicious however.   Cute restaurant though and we want to come back to try other things."}
{"text":"SkinnyFat's has become one of my go to spots since moving to Vegas and I love how you can decide if you want that Healthy menu or that Happy Menu. Both with rock your socks.!"}
{"text":"This is a review of the Skinny Fats on Warm Springs, their Dean Martin location is smaller, but always amazing.    Every time I have gone to the Warm Springs location I have unfortunately had to wait 30 minutes to 45 minutes for a To Go order. The first time I ordered 2 of the Ahi Taco San with no mango pico and an order of the BuffChix. I know from going to the Dean Martin location that with anything made to order there would be a small wait, plus they were a little busy for lunch service. After 20minutes of watching people that came after me now receiving their food, I started to get worried. But I continued to wait, sipping on the complementary cucumber lemon water, which is quite refreshing. After another 10 minutes one of the staff asked if I needed help and told him that was just waiting for my to go order. He said that he would check on it and after another 15 minutes I finally received my food. A super tall gentleman said he was sorry for the long wait time and asked for my name, number and email so he can \"make it right\". I got home to my now super hungry wife and to her dismay, there was mango pico all over the Ahi Taco Sans. I  also haven't received an email/telephone call to make things right since (about 3 months ago).    Last night the same thing happened again. Except it was only 30 minutes wait and the good news was that there was no mango pico, the bad news was that her Ahi taco San was now cold.     Two out of Three times we have visited this location have been disasters. I love the Dean Martin location, and will probably continue business there. Still hoping you can make things right with a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Love this place and all the healthy options. The service can be short some time and long at other times.  Overall everything is great and fresh."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Skinny Fats since DAY ONE! I am so glad one is in my neighborhood now! When family & friends visit from LA, I LOVE taking them to Skinny Fats and they rant about it! They are excited about the expansion to LA too!  The service is always Top Notch! Everyone is friendly and kind. Definitely a great ambiance!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  There food is always so good and different.  I try to get something different every time.   I've never had a bad thing here.  The lemon blueberry cookies are the bomb!   One of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Small and over priced. We were a party of 4. We ordered 2 steakations, 1 classic burger, 1 steakonia & 2 drinks. Total was $56. All came with small (less than a hand full) fries. The steakations were cold and bland, and all the fries were room temp. The steakonia was greasy. The location is very small and tight to walk through. I was not impressed and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. We got there just in time because a huge breakfast/lunch break happened and it got full quick.  Few tables and you seat yourself which to me is a plus. Seating by the window bar.  I loved it"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.. the concept is fun and cute, but its a miss for me.  I (partly) can't get behind the concept because I don't know how they break down and define the skinny portion of the menu versus the fat side.    Is it skinny because its low calorie?... well it doesn't seem to be very healthy.  Most of the food seems loaded with sugars and fat free ingredients.  Which isn't my idea of healthy nor skinny.  However, if you compare the skinny to the fat side, you may be doing a little better but I still can't be sure without more information on the menu.   The menu is confusing already, so it would be great if they simplified it and added some more information or details about what you're eating.  (i.e. Organic, No GMO's, Fat free, Low Calorie)  Also, I didn't feel that the flavors were well developed.  They seem either too salty or too packed with sugar.  This was my biggest issue.  I've been about 3 times and I've been disappointed each time.    I think this place has great potential and would love for it to improve, but I can't give it my recommendation.    Interior is cute, staff seemed nice, wait time wasn't too bad, I like the self seating, but its a very confusing menu and concept that I can't agree with.... However, I hope I'm wrong. I hope that skinny means healthy with quality ingredients (Organic, low salt, NO GMO's, etc. ) and not just low calorie with lots of salt and sugar or a fat free salad dressing versus a regular salad dressing."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I had high hopes.  Silly me.  A tiny, crammed dining room about 84 degrees is not an environment for a relaxing lunch.  Add  hard biscuits, over cooked eggs and a cook VERY stingy with gravy and the meal was a disaster.  Then offer a couple of tablespoons of syrup for a whole waffle.  It's not like the food is cheap.  So turn up the air conditioning, be more generous with gravy and syrup.  Though it doesn't matter to me, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food but the portions have been getting smaller. I live right down the street and love to stop by but because of them changing the food I have stopped. The food is still delicious but the portion has been smaller and the price is the same."}
{"text":"Ordered the classic and added an egg on top! Always amazing food with great taste! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is good. The service is always friendly and inviting. My complaint... your spice is overboard. Shrimp in a boat has come out and been inedible from how spicy it is. There's a soup as well that was spicy but inedible because it was wayyyyy to spicy. Other times your chicken is SO bland. No seasoning at all. Other than that I love this place."}
{"text":"Great concept!!! On each side of the menu there is a different version of each meal.  One side will have a healthier version of a meal.  I ordered a Chix on Broadway and it was fantastic.  There was probably 10 different items I wanted to try, so I'm sure I'll be back.  I also saw some of the other meals that people were getting and the food look great with nice presentation.  The atmosphere is great and the outside seating has a San Diego feel to it.  If you get a chance to go to SkinnyFats, I'm sure you will enjoy it.  The staff is very friendly and the food comes out quickly, which was nice since we were on our work lunch break.  The prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge.  I just found a new favorite place to visit."}
{"text":"I waited to review this one for a while, but  5 stars it is.  There is the Skinny side-Slow Boat to China is outstanding. The Fats side, Buff Chix comes with Truffle Fries and Ranch.  Everything here is just as described on the menu.  The vibe is laid back bohemian yuppie, with a private out for seating area.   There can be a line, it us a small place.  It's worth it though, when you have free flavored water, Cucumber Lime that day, or fountain soda like Black Cherry and Cream soda.  Give it a go. Get one from each side, you'll be surprised at how good healthy can be!"}
{"text":"Small cute location. Healthy side and happy(fat) side food options. The food has been hit or miss. I primarily come here for their Amazingggg cookies which include peanut butter, white choc, choc chip, sugar and oatmeal raisin. Also for their juices. My favs are the summer Quench and immunity. I'm  not a fan of beets which a lot of their shakes and juices have in it. You can ask for them not to be in them but I just prefer to order the drinks without them. If u walk in to order drinks or take out, expect to wait as food and drinks are made to order. Also it does get really  busy so tables could get sparse. They have a nice outside location but just make sure to bring a jacket in the winter months. Everyone is friendly and will welcome you when you walk in the door. They are openin lf a juice bar right next door in the beginning of jan."}
{"text":"Have tried the Chicken and Waffles (good), Portobello Burger (very good), Meltdown Burger (very good), Classic Burger (very good) and BLT (terrible, should be taken off the menu). The burgers are excellent with excellent beef quality, while the buns could be improved due to being completely tasteless, fries too could use more ooomph.... sodas, especially the Birch Beer are great. Eggs Benedict and Corn Cake Burger good too. For the most part the food is good but there are a couple of items that should be worked on...."}
{"text":"Came in here for a Cherry Cider drink and we were told we HAD TO order food because that's how their liquor license worked. We ordered taquitos but barely took a bite having just come from breakfast.  The cider was delicious. Then we went back to the cash register to order a different beer. The cashier said we had to get in the long again. That was so ridiculous because there was no one at the cashier which is the place you have to go to order and pay for your beer! I won't be back here again. Poor customer service is a huge turn off"}
{"text":"Such a fun and creative atmosphere. It reminded me of Down Town Las Vegas. I ordered the Rosemary chicken with waffles and it was so delicious. It makes eating out such a healthy option because most of the food on their menu is paleo and vegan friendly."}
{"text":"I love SkinnyFATS!! Absolutely amazing food and staff!! I have tried many items on the menu and have never had anything disappoint! My favorite is the Zucc-It bowl with added shrimp!!! Super healthy, super filling and super yummy!!! The bathrooms are super cute and super clean! Food comes out pretty fast! Parking is great (unless downtown summerlin is busy) lol"}
{"text":"Well where do I start I must say this is one of my favorite places to eat at. Food staff is always super friendly, the restaurant is always clean. I'm here at least once a week to check out all their new yummy food specials. :) This place needs to be on everyones bucket list."}
{"text":"I love SkinnyFats, I love them so much.   I think it's so cool to have two sides of the menu, if you want something healthy aka skinny or something absolutely delicious aka fat haha!  Honestly I've tried both sides and they are equally delicious.  The juices and smoothies are wonderful as well. The soda fountain is awesome because it has many selections.   They also have this super cute salt and pepper shaker, which is a little man that comes apart."}
{"text":"From yelp we entered this location and so glad we did. Great food fresh ingredients and good prices. Their fresh juices are amazing. We love the small location"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  Skinny Fats is one of my favorite places for a quick bite.  It's not quite fast food, but it's not a fancy restaurant.  It's just a great place for lunch.  I love that the menu is split down the middle for healthy options and fat options.  I love that I can order a beer or a fruit a smoothie.  The Nutella shakes are amazing.  The buff chicks (buffalo tenders) are among the best in the city, maybe the best.  The truffle fries are a great side for the tenders, and the sauces are to die for.  Skinny fats offers peppercorn, jalapeño, and pineapple ketchup; all of which are extraordinary.  In fact, I even buy them by the bottle and use them at home.    All this talking about skinny fats, and I want it more than ever.  I really hope they're open right now.."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is not located next to any other restaurants and sits in a parking lot with these other shops like a wood floor store. I enjoy the concept of SkinnyFATS, and their menu is easy to see, the restaurant is a first come first seated place, and you order at the counter and they will bring you your food. While it isn't a huge place, which means it will get easily crowded, my friends and I were lucky to grab a table in the corner. Now back to the concept of this place, on one side of the menu you have the Healthy (skinny) and the other side you have the Happy (fats), and on the back of the menu you have the drinks that range from sodas to the healthy juicers like vegetable fruit juices.   A lot of their food ranges from sandwiches, burgers, tacos, bowls, and they even serve breakfast all day. I originally though \"man the Happy side does like delicious\" but I actually ordered two items from the Healthy side which was the Ahi Srirachi taco (Happy side has tampura ahi tuna tacos) and Naked Chix (a seared chicken bowl served over brown rice).  Naked Chix - dish was light and delicious, while the chicken was sort of bland, the brown rice was great and the whole dish worked with the mango salsa it had on it, the bowl also comes with a yogurt sauce which went interesting with the chicken.   Ahi Srirachi taco - a rather big taco for only $3.50 and it has nice flavors to it, it is also light and has a great mixture of mangos, some slaw and a delicious srirachi aioli sauce. There was plenty of tuna in this taco as well.  Awesome service, and all the workers were quick and very helpful in explaining the concept to noobs like us and what's their favorites."}
{"text":"Still a total five stars! You really can't go wrong with anything from this place.   On this visit I brought my Mom who I knew would totally love it here. We went on a Friday around 11am. It was already busy, but we lucked out and got a table in the back.   I ordered 2 Ahi Tacos from the Healthy Side of the menu and the Slob Cobb from Happy Side. The tacos are huge. I could barley finish one! The mango and sriracha are a perfect blend of flavors! My mom ordered the Bombdiggity. It had a ton of Applewood Smoked Bacon and a tangy aoil that works so well with the toasted Sourdough Bread. Of course I could not forget my husband on this visit and ordered him a Chixs on Broadway with Truffle Fries to go. He was very excited to get Skinnyfats all the way at his office in Green Valley.   Oh, and don't forget to keep your Skinnyfats cup! You can reuse it and if u bring it back you get 50cents off your drink purchase. Can't go wrong with that!! Rock on Skinnyfats!"}
{"text":"My 100th review!  Woohoo.  Went to skinny fats for lunch today with some friends and we ordered a whole bunch of stuff to share.  I love the concept of this restaurant that separates healthy vs. happy (aka fatty) items on the menu.  They also have lots of juices and salads for the health conscious.  We ordered 3 things from the unhealthy menu and 1 item from the healthy side.  We got truffle fries, smotherload breakfast burritos, sirracha ahi tuna tacos (healthy) and the stewy Benedict.  The good: Fries were yummy.  It goes well with the jalapeño ketchup.  The portion size is very generous.  Breakfast burrito - it had steak, sausage, peppers, potatoes and salsa on top.  It also has a delicious sauce that goes on top of the burrito.  It was very flavorful.  Again portion size is huge.    The ahi tacos are individual orders.  We got 3 for 3 people to share.  It comes on a whole wheat tortilla.  When i first bit into it, I can tell that the fish is not that fresh.  But all the salsa, sauce, onions and mango masked the taste.  I guess youre supposed to eat it all together and not just taste the fish itself.  The bad: I didn't really like the stewy benedict.  It was a huge biscuit with an egg on top, hence the benedict, and its smothered in a beef stew.  It was a little salty for me and there wasn't that much meat either.  Next time I come back I defintiely want to try more of their healthy options...especially the juices and not succumb to the bad influences of friends who wants to eat everything off the \"happy/fatty\" menu."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! My friend and I shared the Flat Chix & Greens, Nice to Greek You and an order of sweet potato fries. All of it was flavorful and delicious! Reasonable prices, great atmosphere. Will def go back!"}
{"text":"OMG, the Slow Boat to China salad ROCKS!  And next time, I think I'm going to ask if they can sub. ahi in place of the chicken, which I think will make it even better. Many thanks to Yelp friends L. and T. for introducing me to this place."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Very crowded and finding a table could be a problem but the food is really good.  Healthy and not healthy.  Salads and sandwiches.  I try to go every time I am in town.  I just went at 3pm On Saturday I was there and there was not a place to sit.  I left to go somewhere else.  They need more seating.    I still gave 5/5 from my past visits."}
{"text":"Ok this place has so much hype but I'm not really a fan. The food is ok. Small selection in my opinion and just a tad bit overpriced. I've been here a handful of times now. I've tried several things but nothing makes me really want to come back. I feel the location is way out of the way. I have other places I prefer like EAT or Payard Bistro ect.. I will probably be back because a lot of my friends like it but it's not even in my top 3 breakfAst joints"}
{"text":"Interesting concept.  One I can get on board with.    Healthy food, not so healthy food, one menu.    We of course chose the not healthy food.  Heck, it's Vegas, and we were on our way out of town.  Why not.  The place in hidden in an industrial area.  It's really, really small.  It was crowded and there wasn't an empty seat in the place.  It worked out because we ordered ahead and took our food on the road.  The line was out the door, but we asked the gal at the counter and she said we could skip the line just to pay and pick up our food.    The food...delicious! There's really no need to go into it.  Just take a look at the pics.    The staff were super friendly and quick.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. You can't go wrong picking anything from the menu. I am a big fan of Chix on Broadway."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Las Vegas. I tried it a year before I even moved to Las Vegas when I was out visiting here and I fell in love. They have a healthy and happy side which is perfect because you can eat here no matter what mood you're in. Since I moved out here I started going to an aerial studio right around the corner from here so most days I would come to skinny fats after my classes to eat. I used to come so frequently that one time one of the employees nominated me customer of the month (which is awesome that they show customer appreciation like that). Me and up to 15 friends got a free food party! It was awesome. To this day almost 2 years later they still recognize me and welcome me back every time I come in. It feels like home.   I also love that they have a secret menu and every weekend they have a new Sunday and Benedict. If you follow their social media they post amazing food porn and you can see all of their specials and hidden items. I  So now onto my favorite dishes since I've almost tried them all. From the healthy side are usually go for the chickhumm, which is a grilled chicken breast sandwich with beet hummus. I also really enjoy the ahi tuna sandwich and the new vegan kale Caesar salad (not on the menu, you have to ask for it).   From the happy side, my number one favorite dish in the entire restaurant is the big Parm. It is not on the permanent menu but it is on the computer that has a slideshow of hidden dishes on the secret menu. It's like a chicken Parmesan sandwich. I also love the buff chix, which is buffalo chicken tenders on top of truffle fries. There truffle fries are amazing I crave them all the time.   Honestly you can't go wrong here so try something new every time and I promise you won't be disappointed!  Edit: I did forget to mention the one negative thing I have to say about this location specifically. They are always packed and they always have a very long line. Especially if you go anywhere from noon to one. They do get the food out pretty quickly and are good at accommodating their business but they are always so busy from all the surrounding business Parks"}
{"text":"Awesome place, awesome food. Great staff. I love the ahi taco san and as well as the teriyahi. Well actually i love everything on the menu"}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is always good. They have a unique selection of items and a great variety of sodas. They offer a sugar cane cola ,which is hard to find at most restaurants. It's definitely a unique place to eat and is always busy. Be sure to prepare yourself for a 5-10 minute wait. There's been times I drive up only to leave once I see how big the line is. Try their buffalo cauliflower, it is amazing."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The food was great, the service was fanstastic, and overall it was a great experience. My only complaint is the seating in this place. We went in a dull period so we got a table quickly, but at a busy lunch time period, I cannot imagine trying to find a place to sit. I see they are opening a new location near my home in southwest soon and it appears to be a little bigger. So that might take this joint from a 4 to 5 star. I have the #Merica breakfast from the Happy side of the menu. It was fanfreakingtastic. I would definitely recommend this place. My co-worker loves their juices. The best part about this place is there are too sides of the menu a Happy side (with comfort food galore) and a Healthy side if you are looking for something more healthy. Definitely worth a visit, i know I will be back."}
{"text":"Not as impressed with this location as the other one. The food was not as good, especially the steak in the #Merica. The patio is very bright in the morning because the sun is shining directly on top of you. So not very pleasant and with their little seating inside. They originally charged me $6 for my kid's chocolate milk. Not a shake just milk with chocolate syrup. Then when I brought it to their attention they only refunded me two dollars. Meaning I paid $4.00 the same price as a kids shake. I always thought the prices were high but this was ridiculous. The only reason they get two stars is because of their cool cups. I love them take them home and use them all the time."}
{"text":"This place is great! We were greeted warmly as soon as we walked in the door. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly and the food is great. The atmosphere of the whole restaurant is inviting and warm."}
{"text":"It was my boyfriend's and my first time here, and it was simply amazing! Their restaurant shouldn't be hard to miss because have a billboard that specifically points to the restaurant. The inside is a little small, but customers come in and eat relatively fast, so no one really has to stand around and wait. Their food was incredibly delicious! We tried a secret menu smoothie, the Hot Mess (appetizer), and the Cherry Popper (Burger). I definitely recommend these items for those who enjoy spicy! All of the girls who helped us were so sweet and helpful! Will be looking forward to our next Vegas trip to come here and dine again!!"}
{"text":"For my goodbye to Vegas meal with my cousin, we settled on SkinnyFATS. Settling isn't the right word though. More like, I've heard so many great things about this place and really wanted to check it out before I left. This night was one of the best decisions I made that day.   Located in a pretty weird strip mall on dean Martin, next to Wendoh Media and Vegas Seven. The surrounding businesses are a bunch of auto shops and stuff. Very odd, however, it wasn't sketchy. I overheard their staff say there's another location opening up north. Sounds like they've hit some success and needed to expand! Speaking of their staff. The staff was super nice and personable. They recommended things to me, made sure to mention the specials and super accommodating . There were two tall guys and next to them, what seemed like a very short girl. Great team, nonetheless.  Overall, the place is a bit small. Grab a table for window seating fast! In this joint, there were decorated wooden paneling, tin roof panels, an electronic menu, a butcher block type counter, and dark wood floors. My impression was a very modern look with a backyard flair.  Here's what I had for dinner:  On special, the Parmesan Crusted Halibut for $10. A nice cut of halibut, pan fried with Parmesan, panko and coconut. It sat on a bed of pico infused brown rice and served with grilled yellow squash. Holy macro, this was AH-MAZE-ING! The fish was moist and flaky, The crust brought a crunchy element but wasn't heavy at all. The rice with pico brought a super clean taste and the soft squash brought the dish full circle  Tu-Nuts for $9.50.Spicy ahi & sriracha slaw in a cucumber boat w/almonds, teriyaki, avocado & sriracha aioli. We asked for the teriyaki on the side (it still tasted great without it). I LOVED THIS DISH!! Highly recommended :) The concept of using the cucumber as a boat was genius, but them you add in the spicy tuna, the crunchy and flavorful slaw and avocado, you've got a perfect start to your meal. The sriracha aioli, was definitely a great enhancement of the dish. SOOOO GOOD!  What I really loved about this place was the menu offered very healthy conscious food, the food comes with a lot of cultural diversity and the portions are huge! It's kind of located in an odd area of town, but trust me, soooo worth it! After a nice hike or dinner after the gym, SkinnyFATS will not disappoint. Check them out!"}
{"text":"awesome place they Philly cheese steak was freaking amazing.  the staff was great awesome service. will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here as our last stop for a bachelorette party before heading back to San Diego. I ordered the buffalo chicken strips and truffle fries with ranch on the side. It was delicious and exactly what my hangover needed.   One of my friends ordered the hangover cure juice and it was very fresh and tasty. The menu is split into healthy and happy I believe, which is not so healthy. Everything sounded amazing and it was hard to make a decision. I will definitely come back here again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went there with my girlfriend, ordered one pizza, chicken and waffle, and one burrito. I was keep thinking that it was just normal, actually not worth vs how much it is. And realized that I was supposed to order sandwiches. I guess I made mistake on that part. Food was good, nothing special though. It was pretty busy but they took good care of us. Since I had great time there, I would give them 5 stars, and maybe another time, I will be back to order sandwich so that I can write a real review based upon their signature dishes."}
{"text":"Skinny fats has never disappointed me! Love the ahi tacos, the cranturkey burger, the drunken monkey cakes, and so much more! Everyone is so friendly here but I wish there was more spaces for sitting since it's soooooo busy all the time! This restaurant definitely deserves all the credit and the food has never been a bad experience."}
{"text":"We love skinny fats! Only wish they had more vegan friendly options! Other than that...birch beer on tap...$3.95 truffle fries....kid friendly items too what's not to love?!"}
{"text":"We've come here often and brought many out of town guests as well! Everyone seems to always find something they love and leave with full bellies and happy moods! We love the truffle fries, Chix on Broadway, the cherry popper burger, and the soda is fun and yummy! Great fun place!"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite Sunday brunch spots!  Firstly, the staff here are super pleasant! They're friendly, energetic and helpful. I totally think the service here rocks when most order and pay type establishments really don't offer much service at all.   The food has been pretty solid. I have favorites on the menu: caulifire, teri-ahi sandwich, smotherload (ask for more sauce!),more cow bowl. And there's always something different on their secret menu, their 420 menu, a different weekend or monthly benedict and Sunday Sundae. What's cool and what sucks about the various benedict and sundaes is that they don't repeat... I've had some favorites (chicken curry benedict called curry underwood, and a carrot cake waffle sundae). I really like the ma the meatloaf sandwich and blaze of thunder spicy chicken that's off menu.   I tried Skinnyfats years ago in the OG location and my impression was pretty \"meh\" due to execution. What a difference a few years and location makes! I've actually gone back to that location and the SW one.... This one is THE location! The food is cooked better, the staff is more on it. I've been about a dozen times and only had one day that they looked short staffed so they really weren't at fault for that day being subpar.   I'm glad this isn't far from my house! If I don't know what I want to eat I just go to skinny fats"}
{"text":"I dig the wood paneled shabby chic interior and the skinny/healthy or fat/happy concept so everyone can eat.   The BF were at a awkward time where we needed to get something to eat, but not be too full so that we couldn't eat dinner later with friends so we decided to split some items.   The Cherry Popper came recommended by the guy at the counter so we went with that. Now I loved the flavor components, enjoyed the banana peppers and sauce, but the burger was way too wet. The patty came piping hot and was not rested so the red juices were still oozing out and the slaw/banana peppers were also wet ingredients that contributed to the lake the bottom bun sopped up within minutes. No one loves wet bread so they should toast the buns well, let the meat rest and strain the accompaniments to make this burger the superb star it could be. My picture shows there is a puddle between my burger and fries. You get a choice of side and we grabbed truffle fries which I thought was seasoned perfectly and had a nice crisp. I like that they offer jalapeno ketchup as well on the table!   We also got supposedly the most popular item on the menu according to the guy at the counter - the seared ahi taco. We just picked the two popular items to try than delve off it. It was just aight. The components were fresh enough, but the flavor wasn't anything wowing. Good, not great. I also am someone who believes deeply in heating the tortilla to give it a nicer pliable texture but this was just straight out of the bag wheat tortilla. After the fact I see in pictures CRUNCHY tacos and on their website describe a \"puffed shell\" that probably would be way better and my opinion would have been different. We weren't asked if we wanted crunchy or soft so I don't know if you have to ask or they substituted.  I like the ideas of what they are doing here, the menu ideas are all very enticing. Maybe it was a slightly off day, but it's the execution that fell short for me. Details make a winner. If our bun wasn't soggy and our tortilla was nice and chewy this was a very easy 4 stars. I will be back though to give them another shot though as I suspect there's gotta be something bringing people to this inconvenient location.   FYI There will be a 2nd location opening up on Durango and Warm Springs which while not in my hood, is very convenient as we're always at our friends home in the SW. Keep an eye out as there is just a coming soon sign in the shopping center Mac Shack is in."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas and it's just a little hole in the wall in the industrial part of town.  If you haven't tried it, you really should!  They have a healthy side of the menu and a happy side (not healthy, lol)... so there is something for everyone.  Every time I go I try something new and I haven't been disappointed once!  Today I got the Tu-nuts and it's my favorite so far..  cucumber boat filled with spicy raw ahi tuna, asian slaw and shaved almonds. Topped with avocado, teriyaki sauce and spicy aioli. Yum!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!   I loved the original location and this one is only better. It's still small and first come, first serve on the tables.. but it is bigger and they have a nice patio for additional seating outside.  I've also been told that this location will soon serve beer and wine as well!   :-)  I've been slowly working my way through the menu and have yet to try anything that wasn't delicious!  Their food is so unique and I love the healthy options!"}
{"text":"The boats are delicious...can't say enough about how yummy each dish at this place is! The Frickles (fried pickles) and sauce are amazing together...and cookies are a home run!"}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: 4 - It looked big on the outside, but it is actually pretty tiny on the inside! But it's nice, it's really casual and a fun place for a hangout/quick lunch. It is in a really awkward location though.   SERVICE: 4 - The service was great. The workers were really nice and sweet! They were all genuine and had really fun personalities. Also, considering the long line, our food came out pretty quick.   FOOD: 4 - This location is definitely my favorite one. There was a dispenser for fruit infused water on the counter while you're waiting. Also, I really enjoyed the food. I'm not really a fan of chicken sandwiches, but Chix on Broadway was a really good quality chicken sandwich, and I was delightfully surprised. I also had the truffle fries--didn't really taste any truffle--but the fries were pretty good. It was a great lunch, and I would definitely go back. SkinnyFATS was a place that definitely left me wanting more!"}
{"text":"I went here last week with daughters and young grandchildren.  It was very excellent, I had the Sweet Cheeseus.  It was delicious!!  Great service the entire time!!  Thank you for a great and friendly staff!!  Every one there was very cheerful and happy.  Great experience for us all.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"The juice from this place is sooo good and the food is so tasty love this place and the price on juice is really great I get so tired paying such high fives for juice they really kno that the customer matters"}
{"text":"Am I Skinny or Fat? OR maybe I'm SkinnyFat (no lie, I've had someone tell me that they are \"SkinnyFat\" before and I still don't know what they meant)  The food at this place is that borderline of Body Cleanse and Bootylicious. You have half the menu that will help you watch that figure while you hit the Vegas day clubs and the other half that helps you build that booty for the Vegas night clubs. Either way, it's a place to try!  What did I order: - Cinnutella (the name says it all) - Adobo Hobo (veggie tacos) - Pineapple Jacks (hearty pancakes with some bacon and pineapples)  You're on your way to that JLo Booty after eating here! #Booty"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS I could have loved you... we came in on a Sunday and expected a wait... totally fine... we ended up ordering to go because we thought it would be faster because we needed to be at the airport. 20 minutes past the time they said we would have our food and we start to notice that everyone after us got our food. We asked why and where our food is and he said that they were waiting on one thing... 15 min later, they come out... opened up the thing they were waiting for and it was freezing cold?   Food was not good due to temp and service would have been much better if they were just honest."}
{"text":"Best family dinner as everyone loved their dish.  Good size portions and healthy or happy options.  Going back fit breakfast to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to eat when I can't decide between healthy and ridiculously greasy!   I have tried EVERYTHING on their menu.  So far, my favorite on the Happy side is their Filet O Fire. And the healthy side has to be their Naked Chix bowl. I'm also OBSESSED with the CauliFire shareable!   A couple substitutions if you really want to feast on grease; I would order the secret menu fries \"Happymess\" but I would order it without the NY shaved steak as it can be a little chewy if not eaten right away.   The Big Parm on the secret menu is only 11.95 and totally worth it.   And their Frickles (AKA fried pickles) are 4.20 and for that price they taste like a million bucks.   I like to sub my Naked Chix with Cauliflower rice instead of jasmine or brown rice. Always good to add in those extra veggies whenever you can! The rice doesn't change the taste at all, it's still delicious!!!  If you're wondering weather or not to give this place a try....DO IT! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Tried to introduce my friend to your delicious food and was NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED when we walked in the door. Stood at the menu/order counter for a few minutes, said aloud \"is anyone going to come up here or naw\"...shorter dark haired girl came slowly around the side to the counter NEVER SAID ANYTHING, so I suggested my friend and I just go somewhere else and she sarcastically said \"have a nice day\" as we walked out the door. I love your food and normally the atmosphere is friendly and efficient. Sadly, I'll not be back. Drove to Great Harvest bread co and was WOWED by their customer service so my trip over here wasn't a total waste of time"}
{"text":"Yummy food... but seriously, I can only eat here on paydays as it is a bit expensive for this high low income girl lol"}
{"text":"Walked in waited and lined up immediately. A guy shortly lines up behind us and then shortly right after an old couple from out of nowhere all of a sudden hops in front ahead of us. I turned around to the guy in back of us to confirm that we were at the start of the line and he said yes. None of made a fuss, I guess we just want to eat and have a good day. What I was thinking though was the lack of concern and attentiveness of the girl cashier w/the lip ring and not let the couple know that she bypassed the line and patrons waiting patiently. The food was not bad though. My wife had a chicken salad wrap which was really good, but I will pass next time on my waffle and berries. The best thing we had there was their fresh made juices."}
{"text":"The first meal of our Vegas trip and I picked it OF course. Happy to say that everyone left satisfied! I ordered the \"sweet cheese us\" and yes, it was heavenly.   The fries were perfectly crispy, they hit the spot. And the sandwich was a perfect fusion and savory, cheesy, and something else I couldn't put my finger on, but made the entire meal 100%.   I also tried the Nutella pancakes and I can tell you those were amazing they made me want to cry. Everyone I spoke to at the table (5 gals), loved what they ordered.   The only downside to this was the limited seating. As we were finishing up, people were standing waiting for a place to sit. The entire restaurant is a little cramped, but the food is to die for.  One last thing, it might be difficult to find at first. The directions made us u-turn and we parked by the wrong entrance so that was a little confusing too."}
{"text":"I love Skinny Fats!! This is their newest location in downtown Summerlin. My boyfriend and I have been to their other three locations and I have to say that no matter which one you're at, they've been extremely consistent with their delicious food and excellent customer service. Every time you walk into the restaurant, you're always greeted with a smile.  For the food, they have a wide range of choices whether if you're coming in for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. You can't go wrong with any of their items- healthy and/or happy side. Their menu selection includes breakfast items (such as waffles, pancakes, breakfast sandwiches, etc), salads, burgers, sandwiches, & bowls. My favorite dish is their Tu nuts (ahi with cucumber, avocado, spicy slaw, almonds, & spicy aioli). They even have a variety of flavored ketchups at each table. I love the jalapeño one by the way.   I definitely recommend this place if you're doing some shopping in downtown Summerlin and want to stop in for a bite to eat. Everything is reasonably priced and made fresh to order. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, fun marketing, T E R R I B L E execution. Fast casual??? Arrived 30 minutes after opening, and 4th in line. 3 meals ordered all at the same time - served 15 minutes apart. Are you kidding me?  The owner should congratulated on their marketing and food. It's a clean, fresh environment, but way under built in space. 8 tables - way too crowded.   For a quick breakfast, RUN FROM THIS PLACE. Their inability to deliver all the meals at one table - at the same time makes this a ridiculous experience.   The owner of this place should be horse-whipped, either being completely inept, or for being absent and asleep at the wheel."}
{"text":"Chix on Broadway is one of my favs! But there isn't anything that I've tried that I haven't liked."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh my  This little place is awesome!  They greeted us as soon as we walked in and asked us if we have ever been there before.  No we haven't, she explained the menu to us.  One side was for the healthy people and on the other side of the menu was the same thing that was on the skinny side, but for us non health conscious people.  Only thing I had an issue with, was the menu.  The writing is so small.  So anyway, I didn't see what I was looking for!  When I viewed the photos on yep, I saw chicken and waffles!  I didn't see it on the menu.  So I showed her to photo, she said ohhhhh, that's on the special menu!  Sayyyyyyyyyyyy Whatttttttttttttt?  Ok, well daymmmmm, what else is on that menu!  Anyway, nothing else that I wanted except for the chicken and waffles!  ohhhhh, and a side of eggs.  So there chicken finger!  But OMG, there chicken was so tender and juicy!  If you have ever been to hash house a gogo?  It reminded me of that!  But in my opinon, this is way better than that!  Here at SkinnyFats, ohhh boi do they know how to season there chicken tenders.  Ohhhhh, they will be seeing this face in the near future!"}
{"text":"Just take a look at these meals! The breakfast menu is healthy choices on the left side of the back of the menu and not so healthy on the right. So guess what? I checked myself on the scale this morning ( buck naked of course cause just a pair of underwear or a t shirt will add an extra pound .... of course ) so yours truly went to the right side. Right because who wants to be wrong? Chicken & waffles baby. I think they called it chickenpalooza. It was really, really good. My breakfast tribe ordered egg & avacado on a nice thick slab of texas toast and waffles & berries. The coffee? Free with the purchase of a meal. Score! And it was good."}
{"text":"First time eating here.  (Stopped by once to see a friend. Who said it seemed a little expensive for what they got.) Overall the place was good.   The atmosphere was great. The service good. But make sure to be double clear if you do not like spicy. I made it clear I didn't want anything put onto my food spicy. And she said she could take anything spicy off.   Well everyone one of my items came with hot red peppers and jalapeños. Couldn't enjoy the food they served and I was on a short time frame. Hopefully better next time"}
{"text":"Love this place! I had heard ordering online never works but today that's exactly what I did and it was perfect. Ordered on my phone, paid for it online also. Called to make sure it went through, it had and the employee was super nice. My food was ready when I arrived and tasted as fresh as fresh can get!"}
{"text":"I loved this place I'm from California but this was my go to spot for breakfast & lunch. I hope someday they open a place in Los Angeles"}
{"text":"Finally made my way over to SkinnyFats last weekend and I can't wait to make it back. Love the concept and the food was delicious. Service was just fine and the place is packed... considering its location in a business park, I was impressed they were slammed for lunch on a Saturday.  Chix on Broadway - delicious. Too much lemon aioli for me but that's just a preference and I know for next time to ask for it on the side.  Phatty Philly - good size and taste but not really a philly. A philly has shaved or thinly sliced meat... not chunks of meat. Not that I'm complaining about taste because the meat was good.. but when you see Philly its what you expect and what we ordered it for.  Fries - we had garlic fries and sweet potato and both were a win. Can't wait to go back! So much to try. Eat HAPPY!!"}
{"text":"This corporate block hidden restaurant is a HIT!  Came at 12 pm for lunch, and got a table. 10 min later, there was a huge lunch rush, with an hour wait.  The dishes are all really tasty, even the healthy options... and the sodas with natural cane sugar, tasted delicious! Cream soda. Yum.  Thanks, I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place is great! Fairly priced, taste great , OFF the strip! Wish there was one in florida!  Employees were very very friendly! Cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"The service here was really good and the decor of the restaurant was awesome. The food I'm not too sure of yet. I got the cucumber strawberry smoothie and it had way too much cucumber in it! The caulifire had way too much buffalo sauce on it as well. Other then that the rest of the family loved the food. My husband got a burger and the kids got chicken tenders. The chicken tenders were probably the best tenders my husband and I have ever tasted which was awesome for the kids eating it. Also the fruit bowl side has a wide variety of fruit and you could tell it was very fresh. Overall if I was in the area I would probably try it again but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way again."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with a friend and must say was very surprised. For my wife and I, this is just what we like food was great, atmosphere was awesome, noise level was perfect. Even the staff was helpful and not pushy at all being it was my first time thee. There juices were awesome. This is a must try."}
{"text":"Awesome place food is great people are super friendly !!! Wow delirium BEER REALLY !! Amazing I have no complaints recommend this place to everyone and anytime. One thing though with beer like magic hat, delirium etc you have to have a glass  staff brought me a cool Acrylic cup they use for champagne that was perfect gotta make sure every customer is offered a glass with these types of beer. Once again A plus."}
{"text":"The place has few tables and was packed when our party of four arrived. We follow the line to make our orders and pay at the cashier. While we were lining up, I noticed a couple behind us had the wife grabbing a table before they made their order. After our order was made, there was no table for four available. When I approached the waitress for assistance, she suggested that we took our food to go or split up into two tables of two people. We had to split up because the food is ready and we still don't have a table. Then shortly after that, a table of four left. We tried to move into that table so that we can sit together. But the other couple behind us who grabbed a table before the order was made also want to move to this table. We had a confrontation and the restaurant management offer no help at all. The management should put up signs to tell people not to grab tables until they pay for their order. They should also hold taking eat in orders until there is tables free. Otherwise,  the food will get cold while customers are waiting for tables. Overall, there is just too much hassle eating at this place."}
{"text":"Food was quite average for me this time around. Truffle fries weren't truffley enough. Had \"The Classic\" and the meat was quite bland and maybe a little on the dry side. I'm disappointed, but I often make myself a match to eateries that don't meet my expectations *shrugs*   Otherwise I think it's a great joint. Glad to have it in Las Vegas near Refuge"}
{"text":"\"Bro, I'm hungry!\"  announces my poker bud.  \"What the?\" I start, watching him look over the 'healthy' options.  \"I gotta stay in shape\" he says.  \"Ummm...\" I trail off as I look him up and down, his swimmers physique hidden behind 30lbs of good old American excess.  \"Hey, round is a shape.\" he continues as he orders a double cheeseburger.  Skinny Fats, home of the HAPPY (pre new year, yay!!) and healthy (post new year, boo) menu.  To their credit, the boo menu is tasty.  Straight to it, familiar food.  Nothing fancy.  Nothing over the top.  Solid but not perfect.  The turkey burger (cranburkie) is well made.  Good texture of the burger managing to stay moist with the addition of cranberry and topped with a cranberry yogurt and loads of peppery arugula, semi ripe tomato, and sharp red onion.  OK but desperately needing more salt to bring out the turkey flavor.  The naked Chix (pan roasted chicken breast topped with a mango salsa and sweetened mango basil sauce with a side of cilantro yogurt) is well made.  Well cooked chicken, the salsa and sauce could use more spice heat to balance the mango flavor.  A side of Yummus (rosemary hummus) with it's inherent creamy richness and herbal finish pairs well with the selections.  From the HAPPY menu,  props to the Sweet Cheese Us, a great take on the Philly cheese steak (thin slices of still juicy beef with cherry peppers, deeply caramelized onions, portabello chunks, and a slightly spicy pepper jack, cheddar sauce slathered generously atop).  The Cherry Popper ( 1/2 lb, juicy, dripping burger topped with cherry peppers, a spiced up slaw, pepper jack, and a dripping fried egg to cool it all down in a sweet bread roll) not far behind.  Messy and simply good eats.  One thing, avoid anything \"truffle\" (ie truffle fries).  Synthetic truffle oil.  Ack.  All told, cool concept and vibe designed to hide one's foodie intercessions.  Hey, no one's telling on you."}
{"text":"Yay... They finally have a veggie burger not involving portobello! I was so excited to try the vegan Mean Bean burger and OMG.. So good. Definitely nice to have an option without mushrooms! I ordered it to go with truffle fries (also excellent)."}
{"text":"I went to this place during the mayweather &  paquiao fight.  Got there around 1pm and it was not overly packed like other brunch places. I really enjoyed the food here but thought it was over priced.  My meal came out to almost $20 for the classic with and egg and avocado plus a raw juice! I had got sweet-potato fries and they were really yummy but it doesn't justify my meal being almost $20. I'm not sure if I would come back to this place but it was definitely fun trying it out."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place with a friend and we absolutely love it. The first time I came I had the Cluck Moo...it has filet minion and eggs and a bunch of other fabulously yummy things. A must try! We also had the apple bottom French toast and the berry strong...yes, all 3 of these delicious items are on the skinny menu. You can have yummy food and eat healthy too, say what?! Oh and on the Fats side of the menu...we tried their giant cookies and they were amazing. I feel confident that anything you choose here will be amazing."}
{"text":"This SkinnyFATS is located within Summerlin downtown. It's a bit of a headache to find parking but this spot is totally worth it. SkinnyFATS feature trendy,delicious healthy fat foods. What I really like about the restaurants is that it has the perfect balance of causal and yet hip/fancy vibe to it. I normally get the cherry pooper burger which is a must! For just a $1+ more you can upgrade to a grass fed beef option! (Highly recommend). With the burger you get a choice of one side: fries, truffle fries, breakfast potatoes, etc. try the truffle fries! They have great health smoothies as well as drink.   No matter what time you stop by, you can't go wrong with this place. They have great selections for everyone; from burgers fries, salads, to burritos! Friendly staff and the whole experience was fantastic! If you're ever in the area, try this place out."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday afternoon and it was pretty busy. There isn't a big parking lot and the place itself isn't that big to begin with so it was very cramped and a little confusing to navigate. There were a lot of people in line but we didn't know what to do or how to order. We didn't know and nowhere did they tell us that you line up to order and then they bring the food to you. I think something like a sign at the top or like some tape on the floor would give a better indication of what to do.  The service was great! The workers would ask what we wanted to drink before we got to the front of the cashier so it would speed up the process since it was a long line.  I ordered the Pigzza. Now, reading what it said made me want to get it even though it was early in the morning and I didn't want to start my day off with something too heavy. However, I wasn't too high on any of the other dishes they had so I decided to get it. The pizza itself was a little doughy; the toppings were good but it was just smaller than I thought. It's in the shareable section so I guess I shouldn't have expected too much but the cashier said it could be a meal itself (so I guess I was just really hungry?). Maybe I should've gotten a burger or something that would get me full.  I know I definitely will go to Vegas again but not sure if I'd come back here next time. I might try another restaurant."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, it's near my friend's house. Came here for brunch over the weekend before driving back to LA, we got the s'motherload, which is loaded with shaved beef, sausages, eggs and potatoes in a wrap, kinda like a breakfast burrito. That thing is quite delicious! The only complain is that I think it had a bit too much potatoes. Carb overload.  Also got a veggie healthy drinks, absolutely delicious. Can't remember the name of it, but I think it contains carrots, ginger, and celery, there are more for sure.  Also got a latte before I go, maybe I'm just very picky with coffee,  it's just not strong enough, maybe a bit too much milk."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome food every single time I've gone in. I usually get the Smoke in a Bowl and order the Bleu Balsalmic for my best friend. I add avocado to mine and it's so delicious and filling! The flavors are spot on in both of these bowls...we come here or order delivery from Postmates a few times a week now. We've also ordered the fried pickles and, again, these too are delicious! They're perfectly crisp and the sauce adds a punch of flavor. I tried the Buff Chix Bowl here last time and it's great too, I loved the crunch from the fried jalapeños. I ordered a chocolate chip cookie here last time and it was heavenly. Sometimes it takes quite some time to get your food (even if it isn't busy), but it is always worth it!"}
{"text":"Loved the place, right quantity and right price. Been there twice and I loved it. They close early. My husband order the \"fat\" side and he liked it and I order the \"skinny\" and I liked it but it was too spiced up for me."}
{"text":"yummmmmmmyyyy the building on dean martin is small but sooo good, I recommend calling ahead and carry out"}
{"text":"Food is great and always fresh !!! I love that their breakfast is served all day long!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here almost on a daily basis after work every night. The menu is diverse and fresh. It's fast and the quality is better than most restaurants. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Long line worth the wait this place is delicious! Had the salmon overload and it was on point with the sauce and flavor. My friend had the smotherload and man so good, the cinnatella is bursting with sugared goodness. Everyone is so nice here! They took a bit longer than normal for my friends good to arrive and they gave it to us on the house and a cookie in addition. Man these people know how to treat their customers I want one of these in SF an especially big thanks to Zooey!!!"}
{"text":"The food really good in pictures, I was really excited to try this place.  I ordered the steak eyes with my eggs scrambled. When I got it the egg was in an omelet form which wasn't a big deal but it was soooo dry... Sad to say but I've had more moist eggs at IHOP. Also the biscuit and gravy were not good at all. I barley even finished one.. It just lacked a lot of flavor overall. I also tried the truffle fries and they were dry and flavorless. Big disappointment."}
{"text":"You can taste the quality of the food here. They can get busy but so worth the wait. I wouldn't recommend ordering to go or delivery; I ordered the Buff Chick and green mile for delivery and it was really sad-couldn't get my taste buds to agree with what I remembered it tasting like."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and really enjoyed our brunch. Service was great, with friendly employees serving great food along with several beverage options. They also have a bar. We opted for the TATS turkey club sandwich and truffle fries with a Frose, a delicious slushy of rose and a pink lemonade. Hubby had the patty melt, truffle fries are seriously delicious and a Brazilian IPA. I like how they have a skinny options on the menu and patio was perfect though the place was pretty busy. And I absolutely love that they welcomed our dog on the patio. Hubby and I said we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food. Lots of Paleo options. Fresh menu, fresh concept, fun place to eat. The sitting area is a little small so go early if you can."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and at different times if the day and both visits the staff, food and atmosphere have been fantastic!!!    On my first visit the female at the counter was kind enough to explain what the idea behind Skinnyfats was and how the menu worked.  She was cheerful, helpful and most of all patient, because I couldn't decided what I wanted. (It all sounded so good!!)  The food came out and the server was pleasant, the presentation was amazing and the taste was fabulous!!    I just took my entire family (all 5 of us) and the kids and the husband all found something to eat and they ate it all!!  Again, friendly service, cool atmosphere and excellent food!!  Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place and after months of meaning to get here, I finally tried it out. It's a little hidden (it's right before the train tracks on Dean Martin if you're facing north), definitely small, but very clean and brightly decorated. When my friend and I entered almost right away we were asked if it was our first time there, and a nice guy behind the counter went over the menu with us. Great service and cleanliness gets an automatic three stars in my book as long as the food is decent.  The food surpasses decent. A lot of this is because they had exactly what I was craving, exactly how I wanted it. I got their Cheeseburger Benedict (lettuce, tomato, red onion, cheese, avocado, some kind of delicious sauce, and a nice runny egg) which has everything I like on a burger. If I could \"build my own burger\" this is precisely what I want on it. They give you a choice of sides and I got the salad. It's a good size salad with romaine, tomato, and onion served with ranch. Nothing to write home about, mostly because in America you don't write home about a side salad.  Everything is served on actual plates and metal silverware, which when I wasn't expecting, but it was a nice touch. If I wasn't so adamant about eating a burger, it would have been difficult to choose what to eat. There menu is a decent size and it caters to the fattys (ME) and somewhat to people trying to eat on the healthier side, although I'm not really sure the healthy versions are THAT much better for you. It seems like this place probably gets busy (small and in an industrial part of town), but they have you covered since you can order online. I'm always excited to try out places that aren't conglomerate branded restaurants, but I'm WAY more excited when local places do things right and SkinnyFats delivers."}
{"text":"Healthy and not-so-healthy options. Caulifire was delicious, the cinnutella French toast was super amazing, and the wake and bacon was good. I loved what I ordered and will come again!"}
{"text":"Got a Charlie brownie smoothie it was super yummy for my sweet tooth and you can add protein"}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 76/100  First time I went here, I was excited to try this place out and their healthy side of the menu but ended up ordering a burger and fries because that's what my tummy was craving.   It was onolicious and satisfied my burger cravings. The burger was huge, thick and juicy and better than most burger restaurants that specialize in $10+ burgers.   This location is small and tight, hella packed during lunch time. We were lucky enough to find a table.   I really enjoyed their healthy juices and tried other dishes at catered events and they were delicious as well.   I like their concept, design, and creativity. Will be back."}
{"text":"I was excited, to try this place...I'm disappointed. I'm not sure if it's what I ordered, but this place does not live up to the hype! Buff chix, yuck chix! Cold, cold, cold! Even the truffle fries were cold. Then the low A/C wasn't the business either.  Super small seating area made it worse. To sum it up, cold food, heat and cramped space. I didn't send it back because I'm always fearful of getting a hotuey (spit) in my food. My sister ordered the Hot chix  salad without chicken. She was told that they would cook the cauliflower substitute like the chicken. That didn't happen. The pimp shrimp boat was decent and the risotto balls were pretty good. Overall I'm not sure about going back."}
{"text":"Seriously the bomb! Best burger I had in Vegas ! Best sweet potato fries too ! A nice local spot off the strip"}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy! Perfect for folks on Keto! Great service, great food! So many decisions to make when ordering.... very hip place ... could eat there everyday!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to grab some healthy breakfast on our drive back home from Vegas. I saw that this place had tons of great reviews so we decided to check it out. When we walked in we were greeted by a waitress who was very friendly. She explained the menu and how the whole happy and healthy thing worked. Their menu is very diverse with lots of great options. I liked that they had a special vegetarian menu as well. I got the Liquid Defense Juice and my boyfriend got the Beet It Juice. We also ordered the Very Berry Strong Waffle and Vegwich. The portions here are generous and everything tastes delicious. The waffle came with a mint yogurt sauce which was different but also tasted amazing. I loved their spin on a classic berry waffle. If you are ever in the area this is definitely a must try! It's a pretty small restaurant so make sure you get there early for breakfast unless you want to wait a long time since seating is limited."}
{"text":"Food was ok I'm hoping to go back and try something different. The risotto balls tasted great but the shakes taste horrible. I love the atmosphere and the decor definitely giving it another try"}
{"text":"I love the dichotomy menu and all the choices available. I also enjoy ordering from the secret menu or the special of the day.  My favorite used to be The Steak Eyes but they changed the biscuits to cornbread. So instead of ordering my usual favorite last time, I tried Big Parm. It was good but I don't think I'd order it again. I've never ordered anything I didn't like and for the most part I think their value and quality align. Except for the cookies. They're delicious except the price. $2.95 for one cookie is a little steep."}
{"text":"I came here after reviewing some of the reviews and it was near the place I was staying so it made a nice quick visit.  After coming here it seem like a great place with a great atmosphere but was really small.  The service was good and I like that they had options of healthy food and not so healthy food. I ordered the truffle fries and sweet cheese us sandwich and both were blah.  Very disappointing after looking sooo delicious but there was No flavor No taste.  Very upsetting.  They also charged me for ranch and never gave to me."}
{"text":"This place is located off the beaten path in a business park south of the Strip. Totally worth it! The inside is so cute and the menu is so fun! On the menu there is a healthy side and a happy side. We ordered the Cherry popper (happy side) and the smoke in a bowl (healthy side) plus a fyro smoothie. The Cherry popper was amazing and I highly recommend it! The smoke in a bowl I would never order again. The smoothie was so good too!"}
{"text":"PERFECT PLACE WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE EATING GOOD, BAD OR UGLY!  This place is GENIUS! There is a 'Healthy' side for eating good and a 'Happy' side for eating bad. Good news: Both sides are pretty delicious!   My Healthy Recommendations:  Juice: 1. Hangover Remedy: Mix of Beets and other veggies & fruits.   Apps:  1. Caulifire  Entrees: 1. Teriyahi Sandwich 2. Chickhumm Sandwich 3. Zucc It (This is a noodle made out of zucchini. Low carb & delicious.) 4. If you're trying to stay LOW CARB: Get your choice of meat entree with Cauliflower Rice or Zucchini Noodle.  PS: They also have beers & cocktails here ;)"}
{"text":"Where do I begin with this incredible breakfast place in Las Vegas ! The boy insisted us coming here after a quick visit to LV for a concert, till this day I still crave their breakfast. We ordered the soup , cauliflower , chicken and waffles , and burgers from this joint. It's hard to pin point one thing to order on the menu because everything is so delicious and craftily made here, just order whatever your eyes tell you, you will not be disappointed. And come early so you can get a seat, they get packed pretty quickly ! Make sure to get a smoothie on your way out . Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about here except all the other people in line before you at this place during a busy lunch hour! Had a well prepared tuna steak and would definitely recommend checking this place out to anyone who hasn't been!"}
{"text":"I am at skinny fat's for my first time. I ordered the smothers load breakfast burrito, personally I'm not a fan. Weak flavors, tastes like a burrito made from yesterday's left overs. My wife loved her meal, so I will try it again, but with another dish."}
{"text":"Cranburkey Burger is fantastic! Its the right amount of juicy and lean and also very filling!  A couple years ago I discovered SkinnyFATS and I must admit I was not impressed with their food. After a few years of boycotting this place, I decided to give it another shot and I'm glad I did. I've heard from other people that some things on the menu are hit or miss. Which I completely agree with. However, I was very satisfied with my recent order of the cranburkey burger because of all the flavors the burger had to offer. I also like that it comes with a side. The only negative feed back I have is from my experience of choosing a fruit side for both occasions that I've had the cranburkey and I've noticed the fruit is really soggy and not freshly cut.  I'd still give this place a five star review because the actual taste of the burger is more important than the presentation of the side.   The fried pickles are fantastic also. The portion size is big enough for 2-3 people.   The service is great. The staff is very friendly and enthusiastic to help."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats...is it all HYPE??  Glad to say, it is a solid place to grab some grub!  Is it GREAT?  I'd say no, but it is GOOD!  I went with the Burger Benedict ($10.50): 1/2lb Angus, Lettuce, Tomato, Pickle, Avocado, Fried Egg, Skinny Fats Sauce and Truffle Fries. Burger was juicy and messy. Good taste overall, but I couldn't really taste the SkinnyFats sauce and nothing really EXCITED me about the burger.  Still good and big portions, but being a burger LOVER myself, I don't think I would order it again.  The fries were good, some were very truffle fragrant, and others were a little tame.  But considering the price of admission, they are a GREAT choice of a side, and I would order these every time I am here!  Also tried the Fresh Morning Sandwich ($8): Egg Whites, Sauteed Spinach, Turkey Bacon, Sliced Tomato, Agave Tomato Ketchup, Multigrain Kaiser Roll, and Fresh Fruit. Tasted HEALTHY to me lol...good, but Cathy enjoyed it.  Might fit the bill if you are looking for guilt-free food.  And to drink, we tried a 32oz \"Create Your Own\" Shake ($8.50): Strawberry, Banana, Frozen Yogurt, Soy Milk, and Double Nutella. For having double nutella, I couldn't really taste it, but the strawberry/banana was blended smooth and had a nice taste overall.  Drinks felt a little expensive here, so we shared a large one for a better deal.  I'm sure I will be back at some point :)  Pics :"}
{"text":"Their menu is half angel half Devil, which side would you choose? I chose to be good and ordered tofu curry over rice. It was tasty and healthy! Loved their complimentary flavored water too! It's 15 min from the airport for perfect for a quick meal on the run! Not good for large groups as the seating area is small."}
{"text":"This place has meals that allow you to make the healthy or 'happy' choice. Both healthy and happy are amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"As if Skinny Fats needed another stellar 5 star review but here I go anyways! First and foremost, the excitement of their new location opening soon on the Northwest side of town is beyond me! In the same shopping center as Costco. I'm usually all over the city though so distance isn't an issue well only if you serve food as good as here. They give you that healthy balance feel here with their all American style menu with a pinch of diversity. It's always fresh and fast for the most part. I recently discovered their Hot Mess shareable appetizer which was probably my favorite. I believe it was pita chips style nachos with buffalo chicken bites!! It gave me a little inspiration to create something in my own kitchen that hopefully will taste half as good as here. I think by now we all get it the parking sucks, the seating area is small and well the happy side of the menu is much more appealing than the heathy side but it's definitely worth your time, money and I guess calories too! Ha. If it's your first time be prepared to be a returning customer! Happy Eats y'all!"}
{"text":"Place is legit. A great go-to for a quick quality meal at a great. Been there many times. Would have given it a 5* but the last time we were there, food was very sub-par. Hopefully it was a one-off failure, because it was bad. The other 20+ times has been great."}
{"text":"The food is great and the employees are awesome. The only bad thing about this pace is they want to act like McDonalds and charge you for extra sauce. You guys already make enough money. It should be part of the hospitality of the restaurant to just give it to you."}
{"text":"The place has amazing food. Both sides of the menu, healthy and happy, are delicious. Awesome atmosphere too. I'm definitely coming back for more helpings of smooth immunity. I love the projector and the big screen TV with sports playing. The only drawback is they need a bigger space."}
{"text":"So, I came back to Skinny fats to give it another shot and had a much better experience than the other review insisted. First, customer service was superb, greeted and gave an explanation of the menu and other less expensive options if that was the choice to be made. I ordered a sandwich with the truffle fries and it was very delicious. I also got one of their fruit smoothies and it was tasty as well. This time the price was more reasonable as I chose some options that were on the lower end. I ended up getting some of their cookies too and they were fresh and quite big. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had the basic chix sandwich, the spicy latina soup, and the fried pickles. Was really good, and great service."}
{"text":"I'm kicking myself for not coming here sooner. After a couple of less than pleasant experiences at their first location over on Dean Martin, I had been abstaining for quite some time. My husband convinced me to have lunch here today, and I admit to protesting just a little but gave in.  Katie was our cashier today, she was awesome! Very personable and understanding when it came to doing a bit of customizing on my order to avoid dairy and wheat. Easy peasy with the Tu-Nuts. We also ordered a Green Mile cold pressed juice to share- delicious. And I'm glad we shared between the two of us because it's a pretty big cup. My husband ordered a Chix on Broadway, but by mistake received a Chickhumm. No biggie, he still ate it anyway and finished it up, with a generous side of truffle fries. We also ordered a side of sweet potato truffle fries. I'm a bit of a sweet potato fry critic (much like T is a fry a hot dog critic) and one issue I have consistently noticed is that places can't get them crispy. I am thankful to report that this is not the case here today. We received a huge plate of them and they were SO good. Paired with their CHILLpotle ketchup... YUM.  Every member of their staff that we interacted with today was awesome. I have to give a shout out to the gal who brought out our food and also brought me a side of sriracha (thanks!) and also the one that found my phone, what a fail that would have been.  All in all, I'm happy that they have finally lived up to their hype. We'll definitely be back. OH, and if you can, snag a spot out on their patio- super chill."}
{"text":"I don't come here regularly but when I do i am NEVER disappointed. This is one of those places you don't want to order the same thing every time because they have SO many delicious options you're always going to be satisfied with what you choose.   I personally LOVE the tu-nuts to share it's a MUST TRY if you love tuna as much as I do!!!   The atmosphere is always nice, great for family's, large or small gatherings, they have a huge family style table as well as outdoor seating in the back!  Honestly my only complaint would be how incredibly cold that place is so just make sure you bring a jacket!"}
{"text":"First time here. Been wanting to try this place, but it was always so far away. Ecstatic they opened one close to home. Tons of great items on the menu. Got excited and ordered lots. Beyond the great tasting food, I've got to commend the great service as well. Noticed we were missing a couple of items from the order we placed and when we brought it to their attention, Jason made sure we promptly got the missing items himself and took care of us. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This was a very cool place - small so if you are going during a lunch or when it's busy expect to eat at a counter or get lucky with one of the few tables.  The theme of this place is that there are some really \"healthy\" menu items and some really \"heart clogging\" menu items; all seem to taste good, you just pick from the \"mood\" you are in.    I was in the \"heart clogging/healthy\" mood so went for a chicken meal and it was really good.  Definitely a great experience and would like to try more of the menu when back in the area."}
{"text":"Food is great! I'm not giving a full 5 stars because my food came out 10 minutes before my partners. When I asked why i was told, \"I'm sorry but the kitchen sends out the food as soon as it's ready\" if I wanted to eat alone, I would have come alone. Hopefully that's something that gets fixed."}
{"text":"Food was good but no Service at all when my kids and I went at 10am . Our waitress who dropped our food off never checked on us once .. I had to ask my 10 yr old to get up and ask for a to- go box .. we spent $23 and normally would've tipped at LEAST $10 but this was the first time I did not want to tip anything .. The morning shift people need more energy, especially for the start of everyone's morning this should be important. This is what brought it down to 2 stars .. makes me not wanna come here again. And for only 3 customers to be in there I can't imagine how it would be if they were even just a little more busy.."}
{"text":"Service was awesome .... Fonz is one of a kind.  And the chef Alex cooked some unreal food.  Customized it just for me ... I mean great visit will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great little place. Food was tasty. Staff is very helpful and attentive. You have both healthy and happy  sides of the menu. It is a small place, so it is slightly hard to move around especially if they are busy."}
{"text":"Good thing we were the first ones to walk in because within 15 min of this place opening today it got packed. When it is busy (which it always seems like it is) if you were to walk in you'd kinda want to change your mind just because of the space. It's very small so if you plan coming here with a group you should come before they open. It's an open seating type restaurant where you order in the front then you sit at your table and wait.  Now let's talk about the food..  #Happymess (4/5) basically truffle French fries with steak,Pico de gallo, gorgonzola cheese crumbles. Really good actually I would definitely order it again.I would only recommend it had like a sauce smothered on it or some sour cream. Would probably make it better  #merica (3/5)-is what I personally ordered. I'm a big fan of chicken fried steak and eggs and their version had biscuits instead of toast and what is really missing from this dish is flavor in the gravy and the biscuits weren't that great plus when I'm eating this I love some hashbrowns or country potatoes which it didn't have.  # REDiculous (4/5)-red velvet waffles!!I really like how this dish was put together all the flavors were there and everything but the bacon needs some work   # Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis (5/5)I think this was my  favorite dish very simple and just finger licking good..you can't really go wrong with chicken and waffles unless your waffle is messed up or your chicken is lacking but both paired up well together.I would also order this again  Overall I would definitely be back to try other things but I would hope that they could add some more things to the menu because it seems very limited and I think it would be better if they had more of a variety for breakfast."}
{"text":"I like this location way better. its the same menu with some added stuff. the great thing here is they have outside seating and this big family table in the center of the room."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars!  I've been wanting to try it for a long time.  My wife finally decided to go there and get the food to eat at home.    She got it and by the time I got done doing work around the house and grabbed a cold beer.  The food was cold and I wasn't to happy with the taste but I thought maybe it was because I let it sit for a while.    I went back last night with some of my friends and we had great service and we had great food.  The burgers and nachos are great and we all really enjoyed ourselves.     We will def be back for more."}
{"text":"Love!! Great atmosphere, great food and awesome people! My all time favorite place to eat in LV!"}
{"text":"Freakin love this place! The Pocket Jacks are a personal favorite! Other amazing dishes are Wrap Supastar, Flat Chix & Greens, TBLT, Naked ChIx, and another fav is the Chickhumm sandwich. I order their sweet potato fries with it every time. It is very small so if you're going for lunch be ready to take it to go. There's 2 sides to the menu Healthy or Happy. I ordered from the Healthy side but I've heard great things from the Happy side too!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Restaurant was small and crowded but it's such a cool concept and fun place that it didn't matter. Great menu for everyone!!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here after a kick ass workout at RAW Fitness & let me tell you.... I LOVED this place! They have a healthy side of their menu and a happy side. Cute!  I ordered the wrap star the first time & can you say DELISH?! What's even better is when I went back a second time and ordered the naked chix. Yum! The flavor share strong & the smell alone will get your mouth watering when it hits the table. My husband finally went the other day & ordered off the \"happy\" side & has asked to go back three times already. Now that I've removed all rice, flour, bread, etc, I don't know if I can eat here anymore. Maybe for a cheat day!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to SkinnyFats! The employees there are so friendly and helpful. Example, Joanna the nice lady who placed our order help my husband pick out the right beer by showing him one by one. Our food was out fast and fresh!  5 stars ever time!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here after searching for good chicken waffle in Las Vegas. I used to the chicken waffle in LA which have variety of topping on it not just plain. After try it here it actually not bad but still wish they add more variety of dipping sauces."}
{"text":"Food was bland need to season food better and fillet was over cooked jans carne asada was dry"}
{"text":"Food is creative and good but the set up is somewhat to be desired. No waiting area to accommodate the business and the tables are so close together you have no space or privacy. It's likely that you will be sharing a table with people you have never met.   If that's your thing then you'll enjoy the experience. Not for me unfortunately."}
{"text":"Just amazing. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The environment is chill and relaxed. If you're in the area make it a priority stop if you love good food."}
{"text":"Chix on Broadway so amazing!..I love this place. Kind of in a weird location but great restaurant by far!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat!..love the chix on Broadway and tuna tacos!..everything is amazing here and I am so happy they have a new location close by me!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's always been great. So many delicious options! The only trick is coming when it's not too crazy busy. The place is small and super popular."}
{"text":"Loved it! The food was good and fresh! I had the buffalo chicken salad. The cashier was nice and a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"$45 for two burgers, a kids meal and drinks at lunch time? OUCH. I mean, it was good food... but I'm not sure we will be back. This place was cool and all, but I feel like we can get the same food elsewhere for a better value. Especially since this is an \"order at the counter\" joint."}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this place is the prices. $45 for lunch for two adults and one child. Ouch! Kids pancake (she seemed happy) Cheese steak sandwich with truffle fries (yum) Burger with fried egg and fries (very good) Balls 2.0 (very good risotto balls) 1 Black cherry soda (I'll go back for this!)"}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan. I ordered over the phone and pickup was extremely easy. The food tasted great and I also added shrimp which was grilled to perfection. The interior decor of this hipster spot is unique and appealing! It was busy although I ordered to go so I wasn't too mindful about that. Service was decent and the restaurant was clean. Happy customer!"}
{"text":"First time here and super happy and impressed.   Thanks for the great experience!  Cherry popper was filling and super tasty.  The egg brings it together really well.  Chickawaffadopolis was delish. The chicken was perfect,  moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Waffle also cooked amazing.    I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Always my go to eats after work meetings! Have to try the Tu Nuts hand down!:))"}
{"text":"Really did enjoy my Smoke in a Bowl..could've asked for more pineapples versus' the green bellpeppers. I love yellow or orange peppers better than the green. I feel like a Phat Rat..lol ssshhheeeeessshhhh, hopefully I won't be required to do a lot a work today lmao..very nice restaurant, was greeted by Jackie the cashier. Ethan was also very hospitable and offered great customer service. I will revisit this establishment again."}
{"text":"Great experience when I visited this location. Jennifer the Cashier was awesome. The environment here was very inviting.."}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD! Everything on their menu looks good and the best part is, they have healthy choices and everything is organic! Yum!! This location serves alcohol as well. I had the zucc it with chicken which was AMAZING! The flavors were rich and the chicken was tender. My husband had the applebottom toast with eggs and bacon, which he cleaned up. I wish this place was in Los Angeles! Definitely will be back when I'm in town"}
{"text":"Wow.. This is my new favorite place.. Yummy yummy. Even with all the tempting choices I stuck to the healthy side with a bowl of chicken and rice.   The cucumber juice was outstanding!  My friend had the boneless chicken wings with BBQ sauce and fries it was so good.  I watched the egg dishes come out and the waffles and chicken. Wow!!"}
{"text":"Vegan/ Vegetarian Review:          Everytime I visit Vegas, this is a must stop place for me since they have Vegan-friendly items (after modifications) and I'm always traveling with carnivores, so it's a nice compromise.                  While I wouldn't say the vegan items are amazing overall, it's still pretty impressive for not being a vegan joint, and all of the people I've introduced the place to, enjoyed their food and ambiance.      What I've tried:  Vegwich (veganized) - 3.5/5 (2016)        A grilled portabello mushroom cap topped with spinach, peppered spread, tomato, avocado, and an aioli (which I subbed for hummus).         I wasn't entirely blown away with the flavors. It was a little bland and oily for me  Mean Bean Burger - 4/5        A house-made Bean patty topped with greens, red onions, tomato, avocado, and spicy hummus between wheat buns, this bean Burger was one of the best and hardy Bean burgers I've had in a while. I also slathered on their chipotle hotsauce which I'm addicted to. Haha While it was messy to eat, the flavor of the Patty was on point and I would stick to this Burger over the Vegwich  Caulifire - 2.5/5        I'm not sure if these guys are meant to be fried or not, but they're not crispy at all, and had way too much hotsauce which made them more vinegary than need be (for me at least). But they always seem appetizing in pics, so I've gotten them a few times since everyone wants to try them, but I keep forgetting how 'meh' these are.  Picatta Pinata (Cauliflower taco in 2016) - 2.5/5       Discontinued, and for good reasons... It was kind of a mediocre taco. It had veggie tempura (weren't very memorable) and pico de gallo.  Zucc it - 3.5/5         For a healthy zoodle-pasta dish, it wasn't half bad. It had eggplant, squash, peppers, mushrooms, and cherry tomatoes in a red sauce. I had just a few bites from my friend's dish, and thought it was delicious for what it was. Great for those who want a lighter meal.   Orange Julius (veganized) - 3/5          Just sub the yogurt for soy milk. I just wanted the cute cup. Haha The soy milk wasn't creamy enough, but that's expected.  Overall, it's a solid New -American eatery with a cute motto. You can \"be healthy\"or \"be happy\" with your food choices, since they offer both light and heavy meals, veggie and non veggie, without the cost of flavor (For the most part)  Although I found the cauliflower items to be duds, the sandwiches are pretty good, and so are their fries. My meat eating friends also enjoyed their meals, hence why this place is a keeper. :D  I went down a star, as there were a few duds with their veggie items, and this is a vegan review afterall despite what they think... Haha  Plus waiting for a table can be a bit frustrating if you're in a time crunch, so don't come during peak hours!"}
{"text":"Had the spicy chicken sandwich and the filet was small and somewhat dry.  My girlfriend had the smotherload burrito and she said it was pretty good.  The spicy tortilla soup was very good."}
{"text":"Skinny Fats was an accidental find. The restaurant we originally chose was closed. We walked in to find a bright inviting space. The walls are covered in reclaimed wood, colorful wall art, and eclectic Edison lighting. The staff was helpful and patient as we explored the menu with them. The meal was served quickly and extremely high quality. Quite delicious. My Chickawaffadopolis and Balls 2.0 were prepared to perfection and were served as a great presentation. If you are near either of their two Vegas locations, it is worth the stop."}
{"text":"For those of us that don't like expensive tourist food and just like a place to grab something delicious, healthy or not, this place is awesome.   They have two sides to their menu - the skinny side and \"happy\" side. As you can probably guess, the healthy options and not so healthy options. I chose to eat off the healthy option side, got the supastah. It was so good, and not healthy because it was a small, the portion was quite large!   Clean establishment, happy employees and great service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great spot for the whole family. I loved the environment and the healthy food options for all.   This plate is called the \"Mean Bean\" with sweet potatoes & it was oh so good! Small spicy kick to it, nothing their NONE-fructose corn syrup soda with refills couldn't wash down. They are Vegan and Gluten free friendly. I will go again!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Food is excellent and I love the rotating menu of new items.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. A little odd (or too \"artisan\" maybe for my tastes though) - like the topping on the WTFrench Toast: strange, not complimentary. Maybe an attempt at \"savory.\" Don't expect too much gravy on the 'Merica - so order extra gravy for $2. Service was average. Food came out one plate at a time five minutes between each plate for a table of five. I probably will not come back. Incredibly average."}
{"text":"You must go to this place when in Vegas. I'm so glad I yelped for lunch ideas. It's in a strip mall near the airport and if you blink you may just miss it. When you walk in it can get kind of confusing... Have a friend grab a table if you can, get in line and place your order counter. This place was hopping at 11:30 and even busier as we left. One in our party got French toast (bonjour brûlée) another had the blt (bomb diggity) and I had the shrooming in Philly a mushroom philly sandwich! The truffle fries and sweet potato fries were SO GOOD!!! One of my favorite things was actually the flavored Heinz ketchup (jalapeño and balsamic- AMAZING)! Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Food here is great, large menu to pick from (hard to decide), friendly staff, great atmosphere, the only thing bad I can say about this place is that it very small and crowded. There are about 30ish seats at this place, first come first serve, the people who work there says it's best to wait for someone to leave then hop on as soon as possible. I had the bomb diggity w/ truffle fries, the sandwich itself was delicious, the fries was whatever."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in LV.  Lots of options, all good.  I especially like getting the special Benedicts on the weekends.  Juices are very tasty and healthy.  Good for families or a quick lunch date."}
{"text":"Needed an afternoon snack so we went to Skinny Fats for a milkshake. All I can say is that it was fantastic and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It was my first time here and I was very pleased with my experience. The food was satisfying for my friends and I and exceeded our expectations. The only bad thing about this place is it is small and seating is first come first serve. Thankfully we did not have to wait very long for a table. This will be a restaurant I will come back to when I am back in Vegas."}
{"text":"You really get the best of both worlds here. The menu has \"healthy\" and \"happy\" options side by side on the menu giving you the option to be \"bad\" or \"good\".  I recommend the \"Vegwich\". The Grilled portabello mushroom patty was amazing. The banana pepper add a nice vinegary tangibles to the burger which I loved. I threw some cholula sauce on it to spice it up a bit and enjoyed every bite along with my side of sweet potato fries. Don't forget the jalapeño ketchup for dipping!  My boyfriend had the \"Cherry Popper\" with the truffle fries. Beef patty with grilled onions, banana peppers, and a sunnyside up egg to add to the creaminess. Add the truffle fries on the side and boom! Juicy and creamy goodness. Don't forget the passion fruit iced tea to wash it all down."}
{"text":"Best customer service i ever got from a cashier. Truly amazing what a simple genuine happy approach can do to a business. No wonder her tip jar was popping. The food is good too, healthy, feels home made"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times with friends who are vegetarian, they love this place because it provides them with numerous savory and healthy options. That's the great thing about this place, they are Vegetarian, Vegan, and Gluten free friendly, although I am none of the above I think it's nice for them to accommodate those who are. It even provides personal knowledge for customers like me who are pleased to learn that Vegetarian, Vegan, and Gluten free dishes are indeed one of the most delicious ones! The first couple of visits I ordered from the healthy side but this last visit I wanted to have a HAPPY lunch so straight to the FAT side! Haha!  I brought family in town here around 11:30am and it was super busy!!! There was a line to the door and the dinning room area was totally full, there were people eating outside on the curb and the table next to the restaurant. I stood in line for about 20 to 25 minutes but it gave me time to look over what I wanted to order because I was contemplating over the happy side dishes. I ordered the \"More Cow Bowl\" and my fiancè got the \"Swinetology\" and \"Charlie Brownie Shake.\" Our total came out to about $32. My cousin-in-laws ordered the fries & chicken strips for their toddler and burgers from the healthy side.   After ordering we managed to get a table that just opened up and waited for about 15 minutes until our food came. They took a while for the shake, it came about 5 minutes after we started eating our food. On the table they have napkins for you, different ketchup sauces, and some jelly if your order had toast. Mine and my fiancè' dish was delicious! Their truffle fries with the Swinetology was the most perfect pairing. I left satisfied and because they were busy there were people trying to claim our table already so it was pretty awkward to rush and finish up our food with people standing next to your table waiting. lol I think that when they get busy like that they should have an employee direct table traffic or they should expand! This place never used to be crazy busy when I would come in three years ago."}
{"text":"Total gem off the strip.  When you're tired of spending $100 for crap casino breakfast give this place a try.  Great concept of blending tasty full flavor items with skinny health conscious options.  This place has something for everyone and you can tell they take pride in every aspect of your experience.  We'll done."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a large cold pressed juice to-go. Reasonable prices for healthy food choices. Love their patio area. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Fiancé always get the BLT said it is one of the best he's had."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Love the slow boat to china! But everything I've has is good. It's cute and I like that I have a choice to eat healthy with calorie counts when I'm trying to be healthy. The atmosphere is nice and the service is friendly"}
{"text":"I've only been to this place once and honestly, it wasn't the best first experience. The shakes are really good, but the food, maybe not so much. Maybe because I took it to-go, but it wasn't the best. I've had better."}
{"text":"I've been reading about SkinnyFATS for a year.  Over a year, really, since I started being more active here on Yelp.  Today, after a medical test, I found myself with a little time to kill before I had to head back to work, so I decided to stop in.  What a great concept.  A menu that is healthy, and happy! As Nikki, my cashier, explained to me, the options on the happy side aren't necessarily \"unhealthy\", but there are slightly better versions of them on the \"healthy\" side of the menu.   I love it. There were tons of items to choose from, and I can tell you for sure, I will be back, and SOON to try as much as I can!  Today, in an effort to stay on my healthy living plan, I had the \"Smoke in a bowl\", which was Agave BBQ chicken, with peppers, pineapple,  and onions over brown rice, with black bean salsa,  and cilantro lime yogurt.    Ok fine, I had the truffle fries too.   The chicken bowl was a decent sized serving...a bit more than I could eat, but not an enormous (ridiculous) portion, either.  It was full of flavor.  I really enjoyed the pineapple bits!    The truffle fries, I took to go, and ate when I got to work...well...most of them.  I was pretty full, but they were good.  Not too heavy on the truffle oil, and they were cooked well.  I REALLY enjoyed my visit.   Lets talk about service, too, shall I? Nikki was phenomenal.   I told her it was my first visit, and she explained the menu to me, in detail, and even chatted with me a bit after I had ordered.    It looks like this place gets pretty busy, and its not a big location, so you'll want to try to avoid standard \"lunch times.\"  I got there about 11, and it was empty till about 11:15.    I definitely plan to go back again.  I can't wait!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 10 stars! Everything we sampled was AMAZING! The restaurant concept is brilliant with two sides to each menu! The location was a little odd but there is a GIANT billboard that points you in the right direction! The cherry popper did not disappoint! We will be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Chix on Broadway with a salad. The chicken sandwich was so boring and the salad was just weird. I paid $3 for their home made soda that also was weird. Spent $30 for two and we left feeling not satisfied. Is cool inside tho and they play good music. However 1 of 2 large tv was playing ridiculous hockey. I've eaten at SF several times before and enjoyed it but for the price, lack of taste, and playing hockey over baseball I'm probably done with them."}
{"text":"It was super good ... i recommend this place more then just a burger!.  They have breakfast too"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite. We went here straight off the plane and it sure was NOT a disappointment. The line is long, so we waited about 15-20mins to order, but food is fresh and tasty. I also loved that the soda was made out of cane sugar!"}
{"text":"I had a problem with this place a couple of months ago. I gave them a bad review because of smaller portions and higher prices. The Manager Lana got right back and promised to remedy the problems. I finally went back last night and she really did her job. Portions are bigger and customer service. They are lucky to have a manager who cares and really knows how to do the job. She is great. I will definitely be back. Probably next week lol. I highly recommend this place. Good people great management and delicious food. Thank you again Lana"}
{"text":"I love skinny fats! I appreciate that this location opens early on Sundays as it tends to get busy right away. There's more room at this location and I like that you can go shopping after you eat breakfast haha. They changed a few things on the menu and got rid of the berry French toast, now it's a wheat waffle and not as good. I did try their avocado toast with fried egg, it was surprisingly tasty with the pesto spread on it. The staff is really friendly too. You'll still find most of the same menu items, recyclable cups, large TVs, and decor as you would at the other locations."}
{"text":"Great place to have a cheat meal without actually cheating. It's the luxury of eating healthy and being happy. I've been here twice, once for breakfast and once during dinner time I'm Always satisfied with my meals. Once in awhile I get tired of eating super healthy foods only, so when I had that \"cheat meal\" craving I had to think of a place that I knew wouldn't be my typical health-fit meal but that also wouldn't blow up my insides and have me in sheer regret later on. Best part is, I can take my hubby who hates eating healthy, knowing he will be just as satisfied.   I had the smoked bowl, chicken, veggies, brown rice and avocado served with a tasty Housemade BBQ sauce. My hubbs had the Filet O fire, absolutely amazing!!Filet Minon between toast and other goodness? Sure, why not. Don't forget their servings are rather large, grab a side of truffle fries (which are the BEST) and a warm cookie for desert. You can choose from their vegetarian and/or gluten free menu, not to mention they give you a plastic cup to reuse and recycle too! Their soda machine is their own brand with real cane sugar- it just gets better and better."}
{"text":"great food. we loved this place in Vegas and even returned in our way out of town. the place is small though and we almost left the first time due to lack of available seating. it moved faster than we expected though and i thought worth the wait and even worth the price which isn't cheap. impressively friendly staff too :-)"}
{"text":"First time here! And I fell completely in love! Can't believe it took me this long to find this place! The food was amazing!!!! I had the pimp shrimp, perfect serving portions, and skinnyFATS punch juice. The cashier was absolutely sweet and helpful, her name was Kathryn. I'd definitely be back very soon"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant but they do have a patio. The interior is very fun and relaxed. I liked that the soda machine was not your typical pepsi or coca cola but it was a different brand, very cool! Well the ordering process is very easy, do you want to be a fat ass or are you counting calories? I opted for the healthy/skinny options and ordered the bare chicken with the side of slaw chee because the cashier lady told me it was similar to kimchee and I go nuts for that stuff.   The portion of my chicken entree was pretty good, I did not feel stuffed at all, maybe that's because it was part of the healthy options. It comes with a mango sauce which was pretty good with the chicken and the brown rice but I also came with some kind of cilantro dressing which I had no clue what it was for, it tasted very good but it didn't really mesh with the meal.   I would describe the slaw chee as coleslaw with a bunch of random dressing, it was just alright.   I think I need to go back and try their fat meals. I follow them on instagram and all their posts look delicious. This is a fun little restaurant but the food was just okay. Oh and the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Visit SkinnyFATS while out in Vegas visiting family. I adored this little place! Reminds me of cute hipster hole in the wall place back home in Richmond, VA. I had the Ahi-Tacos San Ana cane cola. Both had great flavor. I love the tempura batter on the ahi and crispy taco shells were yummy...I should've ordered more than two tacos! I will definitely come back here to visit!"}
{"text":"So I'm torn between three and four stars because while the healthy stuff is well, healthy, it's just not as good as the happy side of the menu. I ended up getting a garden shake and while I have no problem with a grassy taste taking a front seat in my smoothies and juices, others might find it a bit too \"herbaceous.\" I also got the TBLT which was good, but again, it's turkey bacon and will never rise up to its porcine competition (if you can call that competition...).  Anyway, in summary, while I'm definitely a fan, I'm a fan of happy and healthy can just take a backseat."}
{"text":"Ordered the Tu-Nuts (Ahi poke, cucumber boat, spicy slaw, almonds, spicy aioli, avocado).  Ahi was fresh, slaw was heavily doused in mayonnaise and too salty and sweet to enjoy the fresh fish."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. A really great idea. Well prepared healthy options ! Wish they offered better soft drinks but was ok with what they had"}
{"text":"Holy crap is this food amazing  the staff is so friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is cute too. Next time I'm in Vegas I will def be back"}
{"text":"True score is 4.5 stars.   After a meal here, you may be feeling more fat than skinny. My roommate brought home some delicious fried pickles the other night and I had to know where he got them. Sure enough, it was SkinnyFats. I was planning to make a trip over, but Bubs suprised me with a smorgasbord of items for dinner. We had fried pickles, a shrimp taco, a mahi taco, poke with cucumber, a sourdough burger with a side of truffle fries, and a mango shake. All of that was around $50. Decent portions but it did lean towards the pricey side. Sorry for the lack of pics. It all looked so good I couldn't hold back! The poke was served with avocado slices on a hollowed out cucumber. It completely fell apart, but the flavor profile was still good. Original way to serve poke. Nice and fresh. The only items that fell a little short were the truffle fries and the mahi taco. The taco had good sauce, but the fish was a tad on the dry side. The truffle fries were shoe string skinny. I may be biased but I prefer thick cut. Overall everything tasted good so I will most definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at SkinnyFATS. Everyone there were so helpful. The servers asked if it was our first time and took time to explain the menu and the specials that were not on the menu. Their menu has a healthy side and a Happy side. Seating is limited and it was packed. You basically seat yourself and due to the crowd of people, you'll have to wait a bit for a table.  I had the steak eyes 2.0 (country fried steak with jalapeño cornbread and gravy with 2 eggs). I don't really eat spicy food but the cornbread had just the right amount to give the cornbread a kick. I hope they open one in L.A.. Next time I am visiting In the Las Vegas area, I will definitely be stopping here."}
{"text":"100% redeemed! Our visit a couple of days ago was amazing. We got a Wake N' Bacon and a Chix On Broadway (I've given up vegetarianism since my original review. Bacon.). Anyway, there is no way things could have been better unless it had been free. The tables were different and not sticky, everything was very clean. Our order came out quickly and was delicious. I'll definitely order the Chix again next time I am there."}
{"text":"A true taste. The Cherry Popper is quite amazing, as is the Buff Chix. The fried pickles are nuts; crispy slices with a sauce worthy of drinking."}
{"text":"LOVE Skinnyfats! I've been coming here since before this location opened and was so happy to hear that they were opening one less than 5 minutes away from my house! I love the concept of this place. The food is great and the staff is so friendly which makes my experiences 10x better! My personal favorites are the TBLT & Chickumm from the healthy side and Tunuts and Meltdown from the happy side. The cookies are also so yummy too! Skinnyfats is def. one of my favorite restaurants hands down."}
{"text":"I love skinnyfats I love the options that they have either you can be extra healthy and skinny or overindulging beyond the fat side of the menu. This location is super small which looks like it could only hold up to 40 people and that is Max. I love to sit and eat my food there however, the seating is so limited that it didn't make the experience that enjoyable. While waiting in line order food people were grabbing tables jumping the line getting drinks was a pain cuz you always have to ask them behind the counter I understand that this might be the original location but I prefer the other locations throughout the valley just because it has much larger City facilities and the option for you to Self Serve Yourself when you're getting your drinks. Overall the food was good the service just could have been a little faster and addition to opening the more seating."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING!!! 5-stars for taste! Service is top notch as well. That said, here are the reasons Tia place didn't get 5 stars:  -Hard to find in the middle of a business center -Barely any room to sit -Food from other orders gets mixed into my breakfast pancakes... I wonder how that happened?  To elaborate, I ordered the pineapple pancakes (which were delicious btw) and there were some carmelized onions cooked into part of the bottom pancake that clearly did not belong. Probably a part of some egg scramble someone else ordered that got left on the pan. Which begs the question: How often to they clean the pans they use? On the other hand, it shows that they cook all their food and don't just heat up frozen meals (like some places I know)  Oh, and they have USB ports to charge your phone!    I would definitely come back here (maybe during a not so busy time of day)"}
{"text":"Great place when you are still deciding on if you want to eat healthy or have some guilty pleasure food. They separate their menu so that you can choose something on the \"Healthy\" side or the \"Happy\" side. It seems that their menu is almost mirrored in a way because if you see an item on the Healthy side you can look at the Happy side and see the alternative that is not as healthy and vice versa.   My favorites are the Chickawaffadopolis, Wake N Bacon, Meltdown, and Chix on Broadway.   Also, don't forget to check if they have any new items since they do offer items that are temporary and not on the menu! You don't want to miss out!"}
{"text":"I order take out frequently and I would say that I always get good quality, yummy food whether I order from the healthy or happy side. Only feedback I'd have is if they could keep their take out in a warmed until I pick it up, I do notice I have to reheat sometimes even though I only live a 5 min drive away. Their staff is always friendly even when it's slammed and that's part of the reason I always go back."}
{"text":"I ordered a side of truffle fries w/ shaved steak it was really good.. also the chocolate chip cookie I recommend."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this location compared to Warm Springs. Dean Martin's kitchen needs to be better at time management.   I went in for pressed juice and paid at 12:57p but did not get my order until 1:14p. Nearly 20 mins for juice yet those who dined in and ordered food after me were delivered their full meals drinks included, before I got my 1 cup of juice.  Update: Thank you to the manager who reached out to me to turn this experience around.  I will update again when I re-visit this location. +1 Star"}
{"text":"This place was so good. If I could give it a 1000000000 stars I would. The food fries were so good.  I would recommend the truffle fries or the red velvet berry waffle."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, I was a little overwhelmed with the menu as I didn't have time to look it over before heading there. The service was fast and everyone was very friendly. It was busy as it was during lunch. They have a cute outside shaded area. I ordered the meltdown which was absolutely amazing! It was a little pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is a cool eatery hip place to bring my friends from out of town. The place is nice and clean but parking was a little hard when the shopping complex  is busy. It's cute and rustic decor  makes me feel welcomed and especially when the employees are really nice and very helpful even when my friends and I are indecisive. I've been here probably 3 times now, and each different cashier has been very nice,pleasant and helpful. Food is always consistent and very delicious, I've tried. Few dishes on the menu, since my friend cudnt decide she bought 5 entrees for just the 2 of us, lol.  Prices were reasonable and serving portions were good sizes, pretty good sizes. I like the different varieties on the menu, where u can chose low calorie foods with a mix of comfort food. Nice modern fusion foods mix.  Its a great place to bring friends from out of town especially when they don't have food like this in their hometowns,lol  Everything was really delicious, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. The atmosphere is stellar, the menu is delish. I'm compelled to write this review because there was just a small miscommunication with my order and Jennifer, the manager, went above and beyond to take care of me. It's rare to see such great customer service... It's obvious that this company and its people really care about their business and their customers."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and there is definitely something for everyone there. They have a good beer selection as well- Delerium Tremens is one of my favorites. The staff is consistently friendly and always served quickly."}
{"text":"Well well we'll what can I say about Skinny Fats, hmm I freaken love this place! LoVe at first BITE! We had the Tu-Nuts highly recommend this cucumber boat, Pimp shrimp was delicious!!!!!! And the shrimp Tacodilla drool lol. The only reason I took off a star is because the place is kinda claustrophobic and kind of annoying to order ur meal then basically find a table to sit down restaurant style. Other than that give it a try!"}
{"text":"Well, had high expectations. Interior is nice, but that's about where it ends. had a breakfast sandwich with egg, bacon, tomato, avocado, and some kind of Aioli. Well, this was about the blandest sandwich I've ever had. they made the eggs 7inches in diameter while the bun (and don't be fooled, the \"brioche\" bread was nothing more than a hamburger bun. no taste whatsoever of any kind of \"Aioli\" in there, and the avocado was not ripe and had a weird lemon taste to it. The potatoes were literally cubed and over-fried pieces, and there were many \"crumbs\" included. Pricing was definitely above where it should be. Next, sampled the pancakes with bananas and chocolate syrup, and whipped cream. Yeah, portion here, way too big, and it was diabetes in a plate. This may be opinion, but trying to make it into a meal by adding bacon on the side doesn't bode well. This was definitely one that you'd have to share with a large table, because no one person can fathom eating this. Coffee was average. Took a long time for service. Probably won't be back. This place plays on the naming, environment, cool graphics and all, but at the end, food is mediocre."}
{"text":"This place is a glorified fast food kind of place as I quote my sister, \"Hey, this looks just like a Chipotle!\" except for SkinnyFats has much more comfortable chairs and the space is really small. During the visit, we ordered a few items including...  The Happy Mess - it's a bowl filled with truffle flavored fries, thin strips of steak and topped with tomato salsa and LOTS of blue cheese. The fries and steak themselves are really good with the ketchup. I don't think the cheese and salsa go well with fries but that's just me. Next time I think I will stick with the plain truffle fries instead.  More Cow Bowl - a rice bowl filled with teriyaki beef, pineapple sauce and vegetables. They used too much sauce which made the whole plate super sweet and heavy. We hated this item.  Ahi Tacos - I didn't try this item but my sister said it was okay. Not great, not horrible.  Edamame with chili garlic glaze - The edamame was drenched in a sweet glaze. I think I prefer regular edamame with sea salt better.  Over all - I'd come back here for fries but I'm not too crazy about the items we ordered.  On a side note, they have fresh squeezed juice here and they're ~$9-10 per drink. That's pretty pricey!"}
{"text":"On the way to a friend's house who lives way out in the boonies (because Fort Apache is literally that far from where I live), I screamed \"THERE'S SKINNYFATS!!\" when I sighted this highly rated eatery. Luckily for me, my husband and I were both starving.   Customer service is amazing! Right when we walked in a barrage of cheerful greetings were launched at us. The cashier was quite chipper and gave a quick overview of the rather large menu. I think my husband was overwhelmed by all the options, but decided on the Cherry Popper Burger after the cashier recommended it. I ordered the Veg-TO-Bowl. Wait time was about 7 minutes for the food.    HELPFUL TIP: Check out the menu beforehand online at http://skinnyfats.com/skinnyfats-menu/ The menu at the restaurant doesn't have pictures and there's just so many options it's hard to know where to start. The online menu will better assist you in picking your order.  CHERRY POPPER BURGER ($12): This burger ain't kidding around. Topped with a fried egg and served on a Hawaiian roll bun, this burger isn't for the faint of heart. Plus, it's gargantuan size is enough to intimidate the bravest of burger lovers. My husband enjoyed his burger but didn't care for the cherry/banana peppers inside. He said he wouldn't order it again on a return visit.  TRUFFLE FRIES: These fries were included with the burger. I only managed to nab 2 or 3, but we both liked these flavorful fries.   VEG-TO-BOWL ($9): I ordered this because the ingredient combination was creative. The bowl consisted of bell peppers, tofu, and random pineapple pieces served on top of a shallow bed of \"portobello fried rice\". Teriyaki sauce and aioli sauce was layered on top of the bowl.   I though I would like the pineapple but it turns out the flavor just threw me off. The tofu was the super soft and squishy kind. I wish there was more rice and more tofu in the bowl. The dominating ingredient were the bell peppers. This entree made me super thirsty! I think it was the aioli sauce. I wouldn't get the Veg-TO-Bowl again. It was good but not good enough to get it twice!  FOUNTAIN DRINKS($2-3): The soda at SkinnyFats is made with cane sugar. This soda is probably the best I've ever had. I had their equivalent of a Coke. My husband tried the root beer, which was also spectacular. The cups they give you are actually reusable! If you keep the cup, on your next visit you'll save $0.50 for a drink.               PRICING: A meal for two came to $27 and some change. We weren't expecting that high of a price tag! There's also a tip section on the receipt after you pay at the register....  ATMOSPHERE: Totally trendy, but I love it! I seen a real live hipster on the premises. Tapered beard, curled up mustache, too tight clothes - the whole sha-bang.   Return Visit? Yes! It just likely won't be in the near future since both SkinnyFats locations are sooooo far away from I live/work.  :(  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #20"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis - Fried Chicken Tenders over a buttermilk waffle One Eyed Monster - Brioche Bun Stuffed with Country Gravy, topped with Applewood Bacon and a fried egg Drunken Monkey Cakes - 3 Pancakes, glazed bananas, whipped cream, marshmallows, chocolate, Applewood Bacon UnBRIElievable - Brioche French toast, brie, basil, strawberries, balsamic glaze Warm Chocolate Chip Cookie Warm Oatmeal Cookie  Now open on Warm Springs Road with early morning hours starting at 7am it was finally on Saturday that curiosity led to breakfast at SkinnyFATS - a half-dozen item order that saw me seated next to owner Reed Slobusky as his front-of-house team of four worked diligently amidst newly refurbished digs of whimsically painted reclaimed wood rising high above concrete floors as tracks from Lorde played loud.  Expectedly the first patron of the day as the doors unlocked it was with a short explanation of the \"Live Healthy, Live Happy\" concept that I was greeted on entry and after piecing together an order to be delivered in two courses a table was selected - College Gameday projected on one wall while a flatscreen displayed the same for those soon to form a line.  Generally not one to dine-out healthy as my weekday consumption is essentially 100% 'clean' it was from the \"Happy\" side of the menu that breakfast began and with free WiFi plus an informative conversation with Mr. Slobusky helping to pass the time it was not long before the first round arrived; the juicy tenders atop a crisp yet pliable waffle pleasant yet predictable with pseudo-Maple syrup that unfortunately added little while the daily special \"One Eyed Monster\" proved a far more innovative concoction with smoky bacon adding just a bit of crunch to a breadbowl reinvention of traditional biscuits and gravy that likely won't find its way onto the Healthy side of the menu anytime soon.  Moving on to more happy things as Reed discussed everything from On Strip expansion plans to Boylan's line of soda, course two began with a triple stack of buttery pancakes beneath an pile of bananas, whip, marshmallows, and chocolate that entirely delicious even without the aforementioned 'syrup,' and once again eschewing any semblance of dietary discretion its tablemate UnBRIElievable would offer the best bites of meal with the eggy brioche proving impressively crisp around a core of molten cheese and fresh berries with while fresh basil and reduced Balsamic provided an aromatic finish that lingered on the lips.  Never one to invest in 'quick casual' or the kind to be caught off-guard craving a 'healthy' meal outside the home my appreciation of Mr. Slobusky's concept hinges largely on the fact that SkinnyFATS is a bit of an anomaly in the growing trend of 'quick and healthy dining that seems to be overtaking many local markets - not only because it is locally owned and operated, but also because it offers the sort of menu that is built to please all palates without seeming preachy or judgmental in the least."}
{"text":"This shit is bomb. There's a skinny menu and a fat menu (healthy and happy) the first place we were able to find Frosé (which is AMAZING). The chicken and waffles are amZing. The Thai five sandwich is so good and the truffle fries are awesome and wtf FANCY KETCHUP!!! Best ketchup I've ever had. Super thrilled with the food and the service and the ambiance. We need this place in San Diego STAT."}
{"text":"Ive literally tried at least 5 different entrees at this place and they were all so delicious. The only reason I had to give it a 4 is because the food takes quite a long time which deters me from coming there as often. I'm okay with waiting for food but it's kind of a \"quick serve\" place where you order at a counter and they bring the food out. If it was more of a sit-down restaurant environment I wouldn't mind waiting but that's not their concept so it is kind of frustrating when food takes over 20/25 minutes. I like the addition of cocktails though!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this location to open for awhile now and now it finally is. This was my first time ever eating at a skinnyfats and I have to say it did not disappoint. I had the classic burger and it was delightful. The skinnyfats spread they put on the burger is to die for. It's different from any other spread I've had on a burger at any other place. The fries were a little soggy by the time I got back home but we're still really good. I'm sure the fries are not like that when they first come out as they were inside a box that got pretty steamy. I definitely recommend this joint. I can't wait to try some of there other items they have on the menu."}
{"text":"Although I'm not one to frequent the same restaurant multiple times...SkinnyFats is the exception to the rule.  This is my favorite lunch spot in the southwest part of the valley.  I especially like coming here on Mondays because it puts me in happy place!    The following our items that I've ordered and enjoyed:   3 Healthy Chicks, Drunken Monkey Cakes, TBLT, Cranburkey, Naked Chix, Smoke in a Bowl, Vegwich, CauliFire, Chix on Broadway, and Buff Chix.  Steer clear of the Mr. Clean juice......yowzers!! The juice  is good for you, but hard to swallow."}
{"text":"First time trying skinny fats! Lines out the door so I knew it was going to be great. They have a great variety of foods and drinks to order from. You have the choice to be \"healthy\" or \"happy\" of course I couldn't decide so I got one of each side haha. The only down side to my delicious meal was the wait time to receive our meal. While I was waiting I ordered fresh cold pressed juices. Being on a juice craze right now I was very pleased to see that they offer it. Id highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear that SkinnyFATS was coming to Downtown Summerlin because their other location was pretty far from me. SkinnyFATS is awesome because you can go either way \"skinny\" or \"fat\". My group ordered a bunch of appetizers, mostly which were not on the healthy side. We got cauli-fire, balls, pimp shrimp, fried pickles, and zucchini noodle + vegetable bowls. Honestly everything was delicious. My favorite were the fried pickles. The staff was beyond friendly and very helpful. My least favorite thing about this place is the soda machine. I love Diet Coke, but their \"Diet Coke\" substitute is nasty. My mom got the root beer and it was equally disgusting. If I were to come here again I would definitely order water to drink because the sodas they offer really are gross. The food, atmosphere, and staff are awesome though!"}
{"text":"Finally a juice bar with a variety of fruit.  Friendly service. Be sure to check the daily specials. The right stuffed is a favorite of nine and the naked chix. Although, I never went wrong with any selection from their menu!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute little place with great service but although that deserves a 5 star rating their food obviously does not meet the same standards"}
{"text":"I've been to this Skinny Fats location twice now. We took a few items to go and on our plane ride home. We got a classic burger and the cherry popper burger. They held together quite well without getting soggy & the flavors were perfect. All items were packaged really well that eating in tight airplane seats was a breeze."}
{"text":"Great service, had some tuna tacos and they were great. Great menu with many options if your craving healthy food too. Would go back soon."}
{"text":"After eating greasy foods for a few days, I was craving something healthy and packed with protein. I went with the breakfast burrito with egg whites & chicken, covered in a yogurt sauce. Yum!  The burrito was flavorful, and the eggs inside were fluffy and filling. The yogurt sauce had Mexican flavor, and it really tied the whole dish together. Next time I would order a side. Unlike the sandwiches, the burrito was served solo.  The waffle dishes other diners were eating looked delish! Next time I'll have to try one of those!  Overall, SkinnyFats is definitely worth a stop if you're looking for something healthy (or glutinous)!"}
{"text":"Had the shroom philly w/truffle fries & the buddah slaw. The food & service are excellent. Will definitely be back. Hey and we did, brought friends too. This time I had the healthy breakfast wrap, that was huge. Great coffee. The wait staff and atmosphere are fun and funky. Go there!"}
{"text":"I really love the concept and vibe of the place, 5 stars for being exactly what I love. Minus one for being overcrowded to the point that people are pressed against each other waiting to order, get food or find a seat in this  tiny place. Also another minus is the food was cold when it was brought out and the famous chicken burger which was the best tasting item we ordered until we saw it was still partially raw, a HUGE no no especially since it was my son eating it and I had to tell him he could not finish it once I saw. I did really like how friendly the service was, but waiting over half an hour for cold food was sad. Also the portions are really small, I should have ordered more, but the prices at least to me reflected the portions would be larger than small plate bites. The brussel sprouts were great, but very small portion, same with the fish taco. Being that they fried the shell to order, it was soggy and cold, cold fish, also not that great. The sauce that came on it, was fantastic, I see SO much potential! My husband liked his philly and fries, but again it was cold and not as great then. Coming during lunch rush was probably not a good idea on our part, fantastic idea and staff, still need to work on execution."}
{"text":"First time here,it was fantastic!The service was very friendly. Lots to chose from healthy and happy sides.All the servers were very helpful and polite. We really enjoyed ourselves,thank you Skinny Fats. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This food is so good. My heart is so happy. Everything is cooked perfectly. I wish this was in Seattle."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute overload. The restaurant interior has a LOT going on (in a good way) so it's quite an experience to soak it all in while trying to decide what to order for the first time. What kind of restaurant blatantly separates healthy from happy foods? Bonus points that this is their defining factor. You actually consciously make a decision whether to eat healthy or happy.  Of course it was my first time, so I had to go all-out. I decided to pop my Cherry Popper burger cherry with the Cherry Popper burger. $12 for a half pound of beef with cherry/banana peppers, spicy slaw, pepper jack, and a fried egg on a Hawaiian roll. The bottom bun was completely soaked by the time I got my burger, but it was sturdy while I ate it. Messy messy messy, but sooo worth it. For those who like spicy burgers, Cherry Popper is the one for you. Half pound is actually quite a lot of meat for the average person... or maybe I just have a small stomach. No regrets about the Cherry Popper. Hands down, hit the spot.  Anyways, I got my burger with a side of their Truffle Fries, which I am not a huge fan of. They were a bit overcooked, but they did taste like truffle oil. Kinda wish I went with the Sweet Potato Fries. Love all the other creative and tasty sounding options on the menu. I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"first meal in las vegas. the menu was a little confusing. the juices were all fruits but then it said it could be ice cream/froyo so i didnt get that ....  i got the turkey burger; the way that the described the burger, it made it seem like there was cranberry sauce on the turkey patty irself but after asking, they incorproated the cranberry into the turkey patty and i didnt taste it at all. the meat itself barely had any flavor but because i added an egg, it was pretty good.  my bf got the meltdown. SO huge. i dont really eat beef but i did take a bite, the sandwich bread itself was nicely buttered and toasted. super flavorful.  next time we're in vegas, we would def come back again."}
{"text":"It was a horrible experience! My son and I went there for lunch, one person a head of us in line that took forever so after waiting for almost 10 min they decided to open the other register.  Girl took our order, got our number and we ended up sitting outside. 2 other groups came after us and they both got their meals while we were still waiting. The girl took our order came back there but never bothered checking on us.  This going over 30 minutes and still nothing.   So, the food was bagged to go and been sitting there for over 30 minutes. Girl was trying to get food out of the bag and put it on plates to serve. Are they for REAL!!!  We paid $31 dollars for 2 burgers. Seriously,  you were going to serve us soggy fries with cold burgers. We asked for refund which took another 15 minutes. I would like reimbursement for an hour waisted out of our lives for the incompetence of others."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in an industrial area, but you can't miss it because of the giant billboard pointing to it say \"SkinnyFATS is right here\".  I wanted to be healthy and I tried the Smoke In A Bowl and it comes with cauliflower rice and it was delicious.  Definitely a skinnyfat dish.  I also wanted to try the tacos.  The ahi taco-san was spicy so be cautious and turnip taco was delicious as well.    I REALLY love the cookies here.  I had the salted caramel cookie and it was delicious.  I wanted to try the peanut butter cookie too, but it would be over doing it on the food.  Hhahah.  I want to come back here on my next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was great. The create fun twists on the classics as well as giving many different options whether you want to eat healthy or indulge a little. This location is very limited on seating so you basically have to pounce on the first available table you see, so it can feel like your being rushed by other customers."}
{"text":"This location is not as good as the one on Dean Martin. I only come to SkinnyFats for the Apollo Fries, they went off the menu for a while now but the location on Dean Martin would always make it for me anyway. I go to this location and felt like I broke the whole flow of the food establishment.   They initially told me they won't make it but I argued that I had it made for me many times even though it was not on the menu. (By the way I think it is ridiculous that this is off the menu because you guys still have all the ingredients for it) They finally decide to make it, got it to-go, I get back at work and see just PLAIN FRIES. Lol, after the fiasco with ordering the fries they still made it wrong. Are these two places not owned by the same person? I know it is so why does this crew seem way less educated about the food than the others.. Not happy with this location at all."}
{"text":"Great Place to eat in Vegas. The healthy side Mean Bran burger with Just the perfect amount of heat.  One of the things that make their sandwiches so good is the bread. Too often places fancy up the sandwiches but the bread falls short.  NOT Here.  Hearty and delicious. Friendly staff. Good sweet potato fries also.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Came around 1:30pm for lunch.  Very crowded.  Took about 15 minutes of waiting in line just to order.  Frustrating.  Food took about another 10-15.  The food was good, but not wait-a-half-hour good.  After everything good I've heard about this place, I'm rather disappointed.  Not sure if I'll be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Everything we got was very good. They also have real sugar sodas! The ketchup was too good so I bought a bottle after thinking hard bout just jacking It . The service was also super friendly."}
{"text":"Located right near the strip, airport, South Premium Outlets, and The Town Center, this place tops the local burger and sandwich shops in town. When trying to find this location,  you miss it since the cute eatery is located also in the strip mall location.  Inside: cute and decorated with tables and table top service, you order first before seating. Best part, you pick where you want to sit, however, try coming when they first open or when the lunch crowd leaves. It can get a bit crowded. As you walk further in, they have their menus. They have sharables, sandwiches, burgers, and then some to order from.   Since my fiancee and I have been eyeing this spot for quite sometime we ordered the following the first time around: fried pickles, the meltdown w/side of truffle fries, the hoagie w/truffle fries, one cream soda and a black cherry soda.   The food: omg, mouth watering, just enough, creative names, and a weekly addiction! Fried pickles were awesome. Sweet and sour taste, ginormous portion and still tastes good even the next day. Perfectly fried all around! The Meltdown, was the best pattie melt that I had in ages. Evenly buttered bread, perfectly cheesy, and that sauce they use will make you take a bite one after the other until you realize you have none left. Loved it! I even ordered it a second time around when we came back. The truffle fries, perfectly cooked as well!! Precise and on point. Not oily or salty, and a must have if you never tried these ever in your life. Hoagie was a bit smaller, but was enough to suffice a huge appetite. What added to the entire meal, the sugar cane sodas! They become addicting, and not the usual fountain sodas you see at other places. They also come in cute refillable cups.   Thank you to the SkinnyFats team! Looking to come back as their menu, customer service, and food got my vote. Another team that makes their food with love and loves their job."}
{"text":"So this is kind of like one of those walk-in places where you place your order and sit .  It was a Friday lunch time and place was packed. We all love the menu because one side had the skinny side and the other side had the fat side so there are a lot of choices. Looks like the bowls where the most popular. I got the vegetarian burger and it was delicious.  Not super Duper impressed but it was a cute spot"}
{"text":"My new favorite local restaurant! Best breakfast I've had in a very long time! The staff was super friendly and helpful. The menu is amazing with healthy options and not as healthy options. The environment was super inviting and clean. A must try!"}
{"text":"On the way back from Vegas we saw the sign from the 15 south and I'm happy that we stop to try it. Very cool looking place and the food was very good."}
{"text":"My bf, sister, and I couldn't decide what to eat on our last day in Vegas. Not wanting to spend $50 per person on a buffet, we decided to come here instead. It's located about 10 minutes off the strip in an industrial-like plaza. It's kinda hidden but you won't miss it because there's literally a huge smiley face on a billboard pointing out the location.  Walking in, we were all shocked to find that inside was filled with people for such a small location. I thought \"Wow! This place must be good!\" ... and boy was I right. The menu is split up into 2 sections, one for healthy alternatives and the other for well yaknow, the good stuff.   On Sundays, they alternate different brunch specials. I decided to try their special that day. It was a Mushroom Benedict made with spinach, eggs, and shrimp. So flavorful! The hollandaise sauce which it was topped off with made each ingredient and bite combine perfectly. I also ordered a side of their breakfast potatoes. Each piece was thinly cut and cooked with bell peppers till they were soft and crispy at the same time.   Definitely a must try location when you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing ahi tuna tacos (actually called the ahi tuna siracha). I've never eaten anything else here cause I can't get enough of the tacos. The only annoying thing about this place is that the location is small so it gets super crowded during the lunch rush. There is a skinny side of the menu with healthy options and a happy side with not so healthy options. This place is super trendy and really really good!"}
{"text":"Please bring the old morning crew back quick fast and in a hurry. The black man russian woman and black woman that worked there in the mornings  were PERFECTION. This new crew made me not want to go back again. The whole.feel.of the place is different nobody said good morning or goodbye. There was a guy scrambling to get things in order. My order wasnt as it usually is, it was just a mess. Please bring the old crew back. They are missed."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is one of my favorite places to get my grub on after working out. I can be in my gym clothes and still get treated with dignity. How dramatic! But seriously, not only is their food good but the service is the best in town. This might even be the first review I write starting with the service first and food second.  As soon as you make your way to the order counter, there's always a big bright smile waiting for you. And I remember when they first opened, we were guinea pigs for menu items they were testing out and they were very receptive to feedback. My friends and family have been coming here every week after the gym since then...sometimes, even more that some employees already know what I'm about to order. I appreciate people who remember little things - it shows that they pay attention and care enough. That or I'm just very predictable.  Moving on to their food...they have a \"skinny\" side and a \"happy\" side on the menu. \"Skinny\" would be the healthier options, and \"happy\" includes fried, rich, or sweet options. I've tried items from both sides and I haven't had anything I didn't like. A list of what I normally get:  Zucc It (spiralized zucchini with steak, eggplant, squash, peppers, mushrooms and arrabiatta sauce) Cluck Moo  Too Nuts Caulifire (cauliflower Buffalo style) Truffle Fries Balls 2.0 (think arancini) Buff Chix (buffalo chicken tenders with a side of truffle fries) Slow Boat to China Smoke in a Bowl Naked Chix More Cow Bowl Charlie Brownie (Nutella, strawberry, banana, froyo, almond milk shake) Cinnutella (cinnamon-sugar French toast with spiced Nutella and orange syrup)  It gets real busy around 12-1pm and 6-7:30pm. We try to come here at odd times to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: use of some yuppie chow language such as \"truffle\" may be offensive to some. Stop reading now and look away.  After feeling like an absolute fatty from eating at a buffet last night, I decided to order from the skinny side. My friend went for the fat side. I got a fresh morning sandwich and truffle fries. My friend got a burger Benedict with truffle fries. We shared a 32oz shake with banana, strawberry, frozen yogurt and of course, Nutella.   Fresh Morning Sandwich: Turkey bacon, egg whites, sautéed spinach, tomato, agave tomato ketchup on a multigrain kaiser roll, and a side of fruit. I had no guilt eating this sandwich but it's quite filling that I had to take half of it home. Good thing it already comes sliced in half. Everything in this sandwich tasted fresh. I love egg whites and find egg yolks disgusting so I love egg white sammies. The kaiser roll was a tad bit dry though. 4/5  Truffle Fries: Skinny fries with chopped parsley and drizzled with truffle oil. Their version is pretty good. Some were a bit soggy. 4/5  Create-Your-Own Shake: We chose banana, strawberry, Nutella and frozen yogurt with soy milk. A yummy shake with less guilt. I appreciate having a choice of 2% milk or soy milk since I'm lactose intolerant. Sharing might not have been a wise choice for us. I had to give Shawn the evil eye so I could get a sip. The cup it comes in is pretty cool. There's a clear part so you can see how much smoothie you still have left. 5/5  As for the burger, I guess you'll have to read my friend's review when he gets to it since I wanted to be good and just stick with my healthy sandwich.  They have environment-friendly cups for their citrus cucumber water. Sit at the bar so you could charge your phone or other gadgets. This was a big plus in my book. The only not-so-positive comment I have is that my fries and our shake didn't come with the rest of our food."}
{"text":"the shroomin in philly and chix on broadway were top notch. the service was also excellent. would definatley return!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is a modern cafe with devil or angel food options. Skinny being food that is light in calories and fat, while Fats will leave a smile on your face (and you may perhaps have to undo the to button of your pants up before leaving).   Since this was my maiden voyage to SkinnyFats, I decided to satiate the devil and the angel. I ordered a Skinny Snack (Ahi Sirachi) and a Skinny Salad (Cobb Me Maybe) and I decided to suck it down with the Charlie Brownin' Shake on the Fat side.  Walking in, you look over the the menu, and I had a very sweet girl explain everything to me: the concept, her favorites, and told me the specials of the day (pro-tip: specials change daily, check Facebook). She also offered me a free sample of their strawberry lemonade (so good). The place has a modern rustic feel and accents of bright, natural colors. There are even fun pictures of fruits, veggies, animals, happy faces painted on the walls. You place your order, then take a seat, and the bring your food and drink to you. The dining room is rather small, so I do not recommend this place for more than groups of 4.   I placed my order, grabbed a seat, and some water, and then my parade of delicious came along. First the Ahi Sirachi. This was amazing. It was light and bursting with flavor. I highly recommend. The Cobb Me Maybe salad was okay. The ingredients were great, but for whatever reason, the dressing was just off... some things aren't meant to be light. The ingredients were fresh and tasty.My shake was heavenly: vanilla ice cream with NUTELLA (the nectar of the Gods), banana, and strawberry blended it. (This shake was on the kids menu, but upgraded to a 16 oz. size). It satiated the devil on my shoulder nicely.  SkinnyFats is a solid place. They also have an assortment of juices, baked items, burgers, salads, soups, snacks, shakes, and breakfast that is served all day and that I am dying to try. I highly recommend giving this place a try. It wasn't 5 star awesome, but it sure does try."}
{"text":"1st off, I'm on the FAT side, but I hear the healthy side is just as good. It's musical chairs in this smallish South West corner location. Eat outside if it's not atomic hot."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place forever!!!  Finally got around to it, and went first thing in the morning on Sunday.  Opens at 9 am.  If you go any later there is always a line.  .   Ordered the chicken and waffles and the cinnanutella French toast.   Waffle was good.  Nothing too fancy. Chicken moist tender and delicious.  Cinnanutella was delicious. Orange spicy syrup was very good.  A little too heavy on the Nutella.  But just my personal preference.  The service was fast and friendly.  Food was on point.  Just very long lines so come early."}
{"text":"Walking in everything on the menu sounds amazing and everything was just what we were looking for after a full non stop weekend of drinking and plenty more... I ordered the steak and eggs over biscuits(forgot the menu name) and my friends meals were all very good as well. Small place so there will be a bit of waiting. Was a bit dissappointed with the sundae i ordered as it was one tiny scoop of basic vanilla ice cream but was tasty never the less."}
{"text":"I love their style of how I know I can get a healthier lower-calorie meal on the left side of the menu if I'm dieting or whatnot, and look to the right side if I want fried food or a filling burger.  Their dishes are unique, delicious and creative. The cost is affordable. It's always packed, but somehow a table always seems to open up when I need it.  I've started going once a week. Their Warm springs road location is larger than the Dean Martin one. I love this place."}
{"text":"The only downside to this place, I think, is that it needs more seating.  I've heard that this one has more than the other Vegas location, but my friend and I had to wait a few minutes to get a place to sit for two.  Other than that... the service was great.  I'm a vegetarian, and they let me swap out the meat that was on the menu for a side dish, so I was able to make my meal even more healthy.  It's a fun place, because they have two sides to the menu: \"Healthy\" and \"Happy\" (i.e., not healthy, haha!).  So, if you're friends with a super healthy person, or a super unhealthy person, there's something for either one!  I would say it's more on the expensive side, just for a small meal; but I enjoyed what I had, and definitely plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Not bad, not amazing. I ordered the cherry popper and it was satisfying with a little kick of heat. I was directed to the truffle fries because they're 'amazing', but they came out very dry and flavorless. The juices were sold out with the exception of the skinny fat punch, which just tasted like ice and fruit. So long as the ingredients are just ice and fruit, that's fine.  It was worth getting off the strip to try a local spot, so give it s try."}
{"text":"I've seen the big Facebook presence this place has and decided to give them a try.   After a serious hike on a Sunday morning we were famished and ready to refuel.  This place has some of the best food I've had in quite a while. Vast amount of healthy-ish items. Food prepared quickly.  Only con (and not enough to lower my rating) for a first timer the menu can be a lot to take in. Seating was at a premium on a Sunday and place was packed. Hard to get someone to explain some of the finer menu options so we just had to go with something."}
{"text":"The first impression of this place is that it is in the middle of nowhere. It is also really small inside.  Staff immediately greets you and explains the menu. They're all very friendly and helpful.  I had their new veggie burger. Black bean, rice, chipotle burger with coleslaw and avocado. It was quite delicious. I hate coleslaw, but this was very edible. Quite delicious. I had it paired with truffle fries, they were pretty good as well.  My friend had a slaw chee salad with seared ahi. It was very tasty. We both agreed we could eat that every week for the rest of the foreseeable future.  I can see us going back here really soon. Everything was delicious, even their water which had oranges, strawberries and such in it.  I hate how small this place is though. We were there for lunch and many people were leaving or taking food to go since there was nowhere to sit. I wouldn't want to take food to go from here. It is nowhere near home, nor anywhere else you can go sit and eat. All around this place is very good. Just be wary of going in at typical lunch times. It cleared out a bit by 3pm. Around 1:30 though there was nowhere to sit.  I can't wait to go back and try some different things. I dot eat meat, so there isn't a vast amount of things I can eat, but there is a few good choices."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Fast and great price. Young vibe and had great paintings on the walls. I got a rice bowl - was very delicious! They also have homemade cream soda that was SO GOOD. I would recommend and defiantly visit again."}
{"text":"Warning: This review was written with a full belly. Viewer Discretion is advised.  WOWwy wow wow wow. This place is awesome in more ways than one...and I just had delivery.  THE FOOD - the menu is droolworthy. Whether you're into the whole \"healthy\" thing or you are in dire need of some serious grub (aka \"happy)- the menu has a bunch of options. As soon as I confirmed that this place would deliver to our office, I was super excited to give this place a try. My health-conscious coworker found multiple lunch options that sounded appealing. She settled on the TBLT (turkey bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich) with sweet potato fries. I of course picked a more caloric option and picked the Phatty Philly (hold the blue cheese) and truffle fries. We shared the Rancho-mame snack option (edamame with drizzled with ranch powder and a side of ranch) and we each got a kids-sized shake. I got the Charlie Brown (nutella, bananas, and strawberries-- um yes please) and she got a gross green shake called Adventure Juice. :) EVERYthing we ordered was great! For food-delivery (I'll talk more more about that later) I was expecting to have a few issues (food cold, shakes melted, blah blah blah) but no. Everything was tasty. My kids-sized shake was the best part and... for only 3 dollars it was a HUGE serving (i'm not great at math but I'm pretty sure I got 16 ounces worth). And it tastes fresh and --just well-made.  My truffle fries were not piping hot (i mean I get why so no complaints) but they tasted great!! My philly which I had thought was super pricey--- it was HUGE!. it was packed with meat, peppers, and huge portobello pieces. It was tender and just awesome. The edamame was delish too. I may have overordered a tad because I have a lot left over. This was due to the GINORMOUS shake I got that I finished first before eating.... I mean really -- $3 for something that big?!!!! It must be a mistake. My coworker L-O-V-E-D her sandwich. They did not skimp on the turkey bacon and.... it was NOT on your mama's wonderbread... this was thick artisan-type bread. No corners were cut here (no pun intended).   DELIVERY - Speaking of not cutting corners--- PROPS go out to their online ordering system. It was smart, simple, and easy to use. I'd give it 5 stars just for that.  The presentation of the food was pretty impressive too. The fry carton was pretty fancy. The container for my edamame is completely reusable and so were the shake cups. I get that they're new and this may change over time but I am still impressed with the quality of their delivery swag. PLUS, I got the food in 30 minutes.... the ETA email said 20 minutes and I thought - who are they kidding - I expected at least an hour. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived in our lobby just 30 minutes later and he profusely apologized for being \"late\".  I laughed - I told him he was right on schedule! Totally worth the extra $5 delivery fee.  I am SO stuffed! SO happy! and I need a nap. What a great & unique lunch spot (closed on weekends) Impress your co-workers & friends! Do it!"}
{"text":"I've been DYYYYING to try this place 5ever! I'm pretty aware that they have multiple locations in the valley but this was the one closer to me. The place was a little extra to get to, coming in from Henderson you need to get to the other side of the freeway, yet my sister and I made the trek. The place is TINY. Like, I was scared to sneeze. I understand that they got creative with the small space, but honestly, a commercial office building isn't working out. I also am aware that we hit up this place on a Saturday. Around 11 in the morning. So I think that we were pretty patient with our given circumstances. I ordered the Berry Strong protein waffle, and my sister ordered the scrambowl. Because there was no seating available, whatsoever, we ordered it to go. I liked the price point and the iced coffee was a great taste and the size was a pleasant surprise.   Our experience made a turn due to a couple that was kind enough to share their table and even share a great conversation with us. But the breakfast was okay. My waffle was tough, but the strawberry chia jaw was sweet without being coy. And the orange agave helped brighten up the dish. My sister was not ecstatic about her bowl, nothing seemed sautéed, more like a microwaved sweaty meal.  When the couple asked for a salsa or house sauce to help out our lackluster food, they told us there was only pico de Gallo. Great. We asked for cholula instead, and they happily gave us the bottle.   We might try again, maybe a weekday. I don't know. We weren't too impressed."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this restaurant & it definitely lived up to it. The staff were extremely friendly and explaining everything on the menu. You have two options, either the healthy side or the not so healthy side. I think both are equally as good. Makes sure you arrive with plenty of waiting time. The seating fills up quickly and you may have to take the food to go."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when my sister and I were in search of a breakfast spot with somewhat healthier options. Thanks to the Yelp app, SkinnyFATS popped up on my radar.   What is SkinnyFATS? Plenty of healthy options available on the left side of the menu: vegan, non GMO, and protein based. Happy options on the right side - sandwiches, burgers, and more.   We arrived early Saturday morning around 10am, right before the rush. My sister and I were able to snag the last open table, thank goodness!  What we ordered:   Fresh Juice - Garden Treat : Carrot, Beet, Cucumber, Agave, Banana, and Froyo - 4 stars  Berry Strong : Protein Waffle, Berries, Strawberry Jam, Orange Agave, and Turkey Bacon - Waffle definitely filled us up, but lacking in syrup, a little too dry - 3.5 stars  Sweet Cheese Us - NY Strip, Pepper Marmalade, Carmelized Onions, Pepper Jack, Portobello, Cheddar Sauce, on a Hoagie. Nothing short of AMAZINGGGG, our Philly Cheese Steak was extremely flavorful and spicy! - 4.5 stars  Side: Truffle Fries - You could smell the truffle, although faint - 3.5 stars  We'll be back soon to sample other menu items!"}
{"text":"Cute little hipster place located in some random industrial part of town.  Definitely worth searching it out!  We are here for lunch on a Thursday and it was packed!  Definitely a lot of local working folks were here for lunch and that is a great sign if the locals and not just tourists are eating here.  It was hard to navigate around the little place it was so packed and we almost didn't have a place to sit.    I got a Flat Chix salad and really enjoyed it.  It actually had a big serving of chicken on top and I wished I had even more arugula to go with it!  The dressing was very tasty and I liked the crunch of the little cucumbers and onion brought to it.  I also split a taco order with my friend so we could each try one.  I got the Turnip Taco and really liked it!  It was a little too spicy for me though...I had to scrape a bit of the habanero sauce off.   I loved the tortilla it came on...it was so soft and tasty.    The concept of the menu is pretty cool.  Healthy options on one side and more indulgent items on the other hence the name Healthy Fats.  Nice to be able to choose between the two at the same place."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the food yeah but someone keeps telling me to try it but I do love their chocolate and peanut butter shakes it is the best in Las Vegas to me"}
{"text":"I don't get the name but food service and atmosphere are all pretty good. Just a little pricey in my eyes but for a quick bite with a nice selection and pretty tasty food and nice casual fast food atmosphere it's a good spot."}
{"text":"Great selection of juices, salad and light dishes. Unfortunately I walked into this healthy joint craving fried chicken. Ordered the buff chic, the truffle fry was delicious."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is exactly what it says it is. They have a skinny, or healthy, side of the menu and they have a fats, or happy, side of the menu. It was like they wanted you to have a mental and psychological break down or something. You know the devil and the angel that appears on your shoulders? Well, the healthy side can be your angel while the happy side can be your devil. Now before I indulge a bit more ... let me start with my story..   I first read about this place when I was randomly browsing yelp and I had wanted to try it. However, the NEED to try it wasn't that great -- mainly because the menu wasn't all that interesting to me. Then came a yelp event where SkinnyFats participated.. well, needless to say that my friend and I were definitely and completely interested in them after we tried their food. So we made it our goal to try this place when we were both free.   Alas! The time has come! I had two friends visiting from out of town last week and we took them to SkinnyFats for lunch. The place was smaller than we thought it would be. It didn't have a whole lot of tables, maybe about 8? But they did have a bar sitting area for the onesies...or for those who can't nab a table. We were lucky enough to nab a table for our party! Also on the side note, there are some seats that are directly in sunlight due to their lack of blinds so be prepared!   Here is what we ordered/what I've tried:  Chix on Broadway: Breaded chicken breast on brioche w/cheddar, lettuce, bacon, tomato, red onion & lemon aioli. Amazing! At first when I read the menu, I was a little on edge with it being chicken breast but I gotta give them props. It was juicy, tender, and full of flavor. The sauce that it had paired so well with the chicken. I had to take the onions out though cause for some reason they were just really spicy. And then half way through, I took the bacon out cause it just ruined the texture. I would be eating this soft and juicy chicken burger only to bite down on some hard, crunchy bacon. It didn't fly with me. Oh and I pretty much finished the whole burger. It was so delicious that I couldn't stop eating even though I was stuffed up to my collar bone. As my co-worker once said, \"Finger licking good!\"   Cheeseburger Benedict: 1/2 lb. Angus burger w/lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar, avocado, red onion, fried egg & SF sauce. Honestly, I wasn't too into this. Maybe because when it comes to a beef burger -- a burger is a burger to me. There wasn't anything special about this and there wasn't anything that was particularly good about this. Once again, I had to take out the onions and I also noticed that you couldn't taste the avocado. Why? It wasn't ripe. In fact, it was kind of hard.   Phatty Philly: Steak, sautéed onion, peppers, portobello, bleu cheese & steak sauce on a hoagie. When I tried a bite or two of this... first off, it had way too much bleu cheese for my liking. Perhaps you could say that I'm a little biased and I'm not a bleu cheese lover but it was really a LOT of bleu cheese! On top of that, even though it said it had sauteed onions, we couldn't really taste it. The steak, however, was very good -- tender and juicy. But overall, it seemed to be missing something.  Phatty Philly (Custom): My friend decided to switch out the peppers for some jalapeno and the bleu cheese for cheddar cheese. Well, when I tried this version... I liked the addition of the jalapeno into it but they didn't give it in slices, they gave it up kind of grinded. It may have been better in slices. I think that keeping the peppers would've been a better choice. It's too bad that they didn't have too many variety of cheeses to choose from. They only had bleu, cheddar, and american, I think? I would've preferred them to have the option of provolone or mozzarella at least as a substitution to the bleu cheese.   Overall my preferred Philly version would have steak, sauteed onions, peppers, jalapenos, portobello, mozzarella/provolone cheese, and of course the sauce.   Ahi Taco-San Tempura: Ahi, sriracha slaw, mango pico & spicy aioli in a puffed shell. Okay, this was DELICIOUS. The puffed shell was amazingly good. The sauces, slaw, and mango went so well together. And the ahi was DELICIOUS. Nothing needs to be said about this besides TRY IT.   Truffle Fries: Honestly, I didn't care too much about these. I may actually prefer just regular fries without the truffle oil. I'm a bit boring. I like my fries regular with some added salt and I'll be a happy camper. Cause if I don't eat the truffle fries right away, they just get soggy and I do NOT like my fries soggy.   So, after all the things that we have tried, you can definitely tell what kind of people we are. We succumbed to our devil's desires ;)  Honestly, the Chix on Broadway and the Ahi Taco-san won it for me in the two trips I went. The food is honestly very good for the ones that I did like. I do plan to go back and try a few more things, such as their french toast!!  So give them a try!"}
{"text":"We got the chicken and waffles as well as steak eyes, wife said that the chicken tasted funny, the steak eyes is very good, definitely not the healthiest option but if you're in for a cheat meal, you should try it."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Excellent salads, sandwiches, and juices! This is our 4 time here in one week! We will be back"}
{"text":"Finally a place where indulgers and dieters can eat!   It matters not what you are in the mood for, this place probably has it on its menu. From overstuffed burgers and sandwiches to creative salads, this place will delight your tastebuds. If you are confused as to what to order, the friendly staff will always offer up some great suggestions."}
{"text":"Great little place away from the madness of the Strip. Came here on a Monday night at 730 and there was no wait! Ordered an array of things! Tu-Nuts was my favorite, because it's refreshing and flavorful. The Ahi Srirachi taco was excellent, and the wheat tortilla definitely made it taste healthy. The truffle fries lacked a bit of oil, but weren't bad. The cherry popper was delicious, according to my husband, especially with the egg and peppers, and generous with the meat. Only thing that really lacked was our soup wasn't hot, and lukewarm at best.    And if you're looking for an immunity boost, go with the Liquid defense juice. Was afraid that the carrots would overpower the flavor, but it was well balanced!"}
{"text":"My family celebrated my daughters birthday at skinny fats the service, and the food  was top notch , thank you so much !!!"}
{"text":"Skinny fats is now the owner of my first 5 star yelp review! Heard of the place but never visited until today! This place is awesome for starters because they split their menu into 2 portions, one side is for healthy food and the other side is dedicated to making delicious food. Kind of makes you feel guilty about ordering from the delicious side lol but both sides are good nonetheless. The service there is excellent as everyone seems to be genuinely happy and want to help you out, was recommended the Cherry popper burger and it was ridiculously delicious, rivals an old fashioned in n out burger! Also had the naked chix, which was a healthy chicken bowl and that was pretty tasty as well!"}
{"text":"So, I just ordered and I'm waiting for my food. But the second I walked in, it seemed really cool. The place is custom decorated and it has its' own look unique look. Haven't seen too many place that really look like this. The spacing is fairly small but to me it gives it that feeling that you walked into something secret and now you're amongst the special few who know about it.  The food came out and looked fantastic. I got the Benedict burger and being my first meal of the day, I had to get something with and egg. It was a pretty good size too that I couldn't even finish all of it.  So if you're definitely looking for something new but want to feel exclusive, try finding this place. It's something of a little secret. ;]"}
{"text":"I came here with my cousin and some other friends for my final meal in Vegas before I made my big move to the east coast. I really dig the fact that SkinnyFATS can cater to my inner fatty or the more health conscious side of me. This unique concept is one reason this place should be a must-go when in Vegas.  The interior is pretty cool, but I think it's way too small for the amount of people who come in here and eat. Seats and tables are super limited, so good luck finding a table if your group is a party of 4+. Luckily, it wasn't terribly crowded when we came in.  The food is pretty amazing here. The nice lady taking my order talked me in to getting something off of their secret menu (the \"secret\" menu items are displayed on the iPads in front of the register).  I got the Filet of Fire, which is a steak sandwich with avocado and fried jalapeños between two perfectly toasted pieces of bread. I was a bit skeptical about it at first because I'm not really an avocado-in-my-sandwich type of guy, but the picture of the sandwich looked so appetizing I just had to try it out!I liked the fact that they left some pink in the steak because I hate it when steak is overcooked. The sandwich had a savory flavor and all the ingredients complemented each other.   The fries were crispy and they taste even better if you dip it in their Sriracha aioli. The Sriracha aioli was rich & creamy, but I definitely was expecting more of the actual Sriracha flavor in it... Still pretty bomb, though!  Cheers to SkinnyFATS for leaving my tastebuds wanting for more!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome food and fast too with delivery! N Katie is such a doll she even remembers the usual customers and before I was familiar with the menu she made awesome suggestions 5 for service and quality!"}
{"text":"Caught the end of the Knights game with the glorious Teriyaki Tuna Sandwich. Sooooo good - oh yea and #StanleyCup Finals baby!!!   Oh and I did mention that Skinny Fats Rocks! My words of advice - try everything once and then go back and try it again! Shakes are great, the sandwiches are to die for and the staff is always cool!   I've been to all three locations and am still a huge fan and advocate of the original, but if you are in the Southwest or Northwest part of the valley - you still get the choice of one amazing restaurant!"}
{"text":"My family and I had a great time at SFs! I like the quirky things about it like the \"Sorry we're Open\" sign. Location is off the beaten path at a business park but I'd prefer that than the crowded strip. I'm from San Francisco so we're used to the small business cafe/diners. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the food.  I had the #Merica* breakfast dish and Liquid Defense juice. DEE-LICIOUS.. Food was hot, cooked to perfection. Chicken was tender, biscuits were moist slightly crusted, gravy went perfect.. I had one egg sunnyside other two, scrambled.  I highly recommend this establishment for any meal. The cafe is small so plan accordingly. They accept calls about current space."}
{"text":"O.....M..... Goodness!!!! want to die of flavor? Go here.... this place is Amazing and DELICIOUS.... they seasoned the food so well I was upset because it was so good... like why? Would you do this to me? Now other food won't ever be this good. Smh go here and you'll be ruined forever, but go lol"}
{"text":"Officially jumping on the bandwagon of SkinnyFATS lovers!  Yup, they've definitely made a fan out of me. A loyal one at that too! I love the variety that's entailed in their name. You can indulge in their \"Happy\" menu or opt for a \"Healthy\" item. There's literally something for everyone.  I try to stick to their \"Healthy\" menu, although I must say that some of their \"Healthy\" items aren't the best for clean-eating. They do, however, offer a healthier choice which is good enough for me! I love their Chickhumm, a multi-grain bun filled with grilled chicken breast, sprouts, tomato, onion & hummus. I always complete the meal by adding a side of truffle fries.  The STEAKation is super tasty as well. It reminds me of a healthy spin on a Philly cheesesteak, except it's made with shaved New York steak, arugula, tomato, onion, and horseradish yogurt on a mutli-grain bun. You can also ask for your burger on a whole wheat hoagie instead! The onions tend to be overbearing so I order it without them. The horseradish yogurt, however, is light yet flavorful.  Asides from their delicious food, their superb service always keeps me coming back. I've never met such a happy, bubbly crew of employees! They take service with a smile to a whole new level. It makes me feel so guilty not tipping when I order to-go here. And who tips on to-go orders?!  Oh yeah! They even offer free hugs! So if hugs from strangers is your thing, this is definitely your kind of place. ;-)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I was here for lunch on Monday and the only problem I encountered was the menu was too big. There are-in my opinion-too many options. The people in front of me ended up taking about 10 minutes to order because the menu was so big.   Little tip: read the menu before going so that you have a small idea of what you will be interested in when you arrive. I looked the menu up before my lunch and it helped a lot. I ordered the 'Happymess' which was amazing. My kids shared the 'naked chix'  and my husband got the 'buff chix'. All was good but mine was the best by far.   Highly recommend. I will be back"}
{"text":"Not only have we loved everything we ordered from SkinnyFats, but mom fell in the parking lot and had to be rushed to the hospital. The staff came running out with CPR knowledge and towels! They were fantastic! The owner gave us his card and asked us to call with an update. He was near tears. What an amazing group of people!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I take everyone I know here and I always get the vegwich sandwich. They found a source of very large portobellos, which is ok, but sometimes they are just too thick.  Today, for example, the portobello was not cooked throughout. Very hard in the center and not marinated through.   I looked on their website for a contact us link (email) and there isn't one. I didn't want to speak to someone at the restaurant because who knows if it would make it to management.  They really need a customer service email option on their website.  I hope they see this and work on their vegwich.  Otherwise, a great spot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had the pleasure of trying this place out on a random day. My food was quite tasty  (Chix on broadway) but my husband was soo disappointed in his smokehouse something or other. It sounded like it would be a lot of meat but it wasn't. I think they have since taken it off the menu or maybe I just missed it when trying to find it in the online menu. I think its clever they have the dual menu but I do think it's a little pricey so we don't come here often."}
{"text":"The cashier was pleasant, and the whole menu looked amazing. They have sugar cane soda and the Black Cherry is my favorite :) I ordered the Melt Down with Truffle Fries and it was so good! Of course I had it done my way, added a fried egg and some bacon. Customizing it made it a bit more pricier but the food was so good I couldn't be that mad about it. It was a late Friday night so of course I went with their Happy menu lol but I do plan on trying their Healthy menu as I saw a lot of yummy looking things on there too. I intend on trying some of the other items I've had my eye on. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is definitely a modern concept for Vegas. It preaches sustainability and fresh ingredients for healthy and delicious food. I have been a few times and each was not a disappointment. Initial view makes it look expensive. Once you see the amount of food you receive for the price, it is a steal. It is definitely one of the new favorite places.  The first visit had me reeling at how delicious the food is. The Smoke in a Bowl is one of my favorites. The mixture of sweetness from the agave BBQ chicken mixed with the savory components made it well balanced. The second time; I got the Slow Boat to China and the aPollo fries. It is a generous portion of both. The hollowed out half cucumber topped with chicken salad and a mixture of sauces was excellent. The sweet potato fries topped with a mixture of sweet and savory. It was odd at first to remember that there are olives, cranberries, chicken, feta, and arugula topped with a balsamic reduction. It worked well together. The breakfast fell into the same catergory. Satisfactory for the most part. I had a few bites of the Creme Brulee french toast and enjoyed it without the maple syrup. The beet salad is nothing special and was the biggest disappointment. I just don't think about them and it was another perfect experience."}
{"text":"This place is rad. They want me to say more to post this so I guess I will say everything is delish on both sides of the menu, & the few locations are relatively far from where I live but I've still been to all of them, as it is worth the drive. Good place to have lunch with a friend or a casual date. Cool staff as well. The end."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was a pretty good experience. The atmosphere is cool and everyone's pretty nice. I got the melt down which is a burger on sourdough with a spicy aioli, cheddar, provolone,  tomato and onion. (I didn't get tomato or onion). I was unsure about the spicy aioli at first but it was really good! And not very spicy. I got it Fries which were also very good. However the burger was very greasy from the butter on the sourdough and kind of messy but definitely worth it! My boyfriend had the cheesesteak which was also very good. We tried a peanut butter cookie and that wasn't very good I don't recommend it. It is kind of pricey but it's pretty good and you get a decent amount of food. Overall I recommend it and definitely suggest trying the meltdown or cheesesteak."}
{"text":"After a few visits to this restaurant, I can honestly say this has become one of my favorite places to eat. The menu features a \"Healthy\" and a \"Happy\" side, making it a great place to eat whether you're on a diet or treating yourself to something nice. I've tried a variety of menu items with my past visits, and I have not been disappointed with any of them. The staff is always friendly and actually seem genuinely happy to be working there. The tables have come equipped with a variety of signature condiments, such as \"Chipotle Catchup\", as well as regular ones, like Heinz ketchup. As for their drinks, they have a big jug of ice cold cucumber lemon water, and their fountain drink selection isn't the usual Coke or Pepsi products. I believe it was Boylan Bottling, which offers cola, cream soda, and even black cherry soda (my favorite!). Overall, my experiences dining here have been very positive ones, and I would definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I was pretty darn happy with my food and service. My only gripe is what happens when all the tables are full and you wanna eat, are you screwed? But anyway... I got the #Merica, great comfort food! The eggs were done perfectly, the gravy and biscuits were hearty and delicious. The chicken fried steak was juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside. Love their soda options too! My husband got The Meltdown with Truffle fries. He loved it. We both loved the crispy flavorful truffle fries (dip those in that country gravy...killer!) So thankful they are in our neighborhood. Prices aren't too bad for the amount of food and the quality. Service was fast and friendly. Love the decor of the restaurant. There is even an outside patio, but you can only get there through the restaurant, so no dogs allowed I'm sure:( We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Love when the entire menu is healthy AND delicious. 4 of us went, all different meals, all great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here for breakfast and the food was delicious.  The fun part is the menu! There is a healthy side and a tasty side which is a little less healthy. But oh gosh is good! They call it the \"happy\" side.  I got the happy side, and the food was excellent! I will totally come back again next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is decent. I stopped by because the reviews on yelp were raving that this place was amazing.  its a tiny spot with a lot of parking space. The food was okay, not what everyone made it out to be. It was lacking flavor and salt. I wont be coming back."}
{"text":"Fun menu, great food, and friendly knowledgeable staff. Will be back!"}
{"text":"HOLY. WOW. SkinnyFATS is the best thing that has ever happened to me.  We'll get the negatives out of the way: the place is small and super crowded. Okay, that covers it.  While the inside is small, the decor is awesome. It has a rustic feel with lots of wood, and the walls are painted with grafitti-like art. It's really cool. I won't break down the concept of this restaurant because clearly all the other reviews break it down well for you. But evvvvverything on the menu sounds so incredible, so I ended up trying 3 different things.  I'm a sucker for 3 things: breakfast foods, protein, and waffles. And I'll be damned, they have protein waffles on the menu. They are absolutely incredible. You wouldn't know they're protein waffles (if you've ever cooked with whey protein, you know it has a pretty distinctive taste and texture) and the agave syrup they serve it with was amazing. I paired with that a breakfast scramble, which was also stellar, and some fried pickles to get a little bit naughty. I ended up being too full to totally enjoy the fried pickles, but I took them to-go and enjoyed them later in the day, and they held up perfectly.  Unfortunately for me, I was only visiting, so I can't have SkinnyFATS for a while now. But I'll be sitting here praying that they franchise to other parts of the country, because I would dine here every single day."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Everything I have tried on the menu has been awesome, and the Seared Ahi Tacos are definately one item you need to try! Atmosphere is a bit crowded, but when a place is this popular you can expect it to be crowded most of the day, every day."}
{"text":"Skinnyfats saves the day yet again!  I love this location, and the outdoor dining area.  The food, the people, and the location are all so awesome.  The only thing that is less than favorable is the parking lot situation; it gets super packed at lunch and dinner time.  On lazy nights, it's the best alternative to actually cooking dinner for me and my love.  We're so addicted to their delicious, healthy options.  So here's a quick rundown:  50% of the menu contains calorie conscious choices, 50% of the menu is the 'Do anything--no holds barred' choices, with 50% of each choice being breakfast, and then 100% of everything they offer, delicious.  I've tried quite a few of their menu offerings, and to date everything I've tried has been amazing.  My absolute favorite is the Flat Chix, which consists of chicken breast covered in arugula, capers, tomato, red onion, cucumber, caper vinaigrette & balsamic reduction.  His top pick is the Naked Chix, which has seared chicken breast in mango basil sauce over brown rice, topped with cilantro yogurt.  Other items of noteworthy mention include the:   Wrap Supastar - Chicken, egg whites, avocado, pico & spinach in a whole wheat tortilla w/cajun cilantro lime yogurt  Slow Boat to China - Asian chicken salad & Slaw Chee in a cucumber boat w/almonds, teriyaki & spicy yo-aioli  Smoke in a Bowl - Agave BBQ chicken, peppers, onion & pineapple over brown rice w/black bean salsa & cilantro lime yogurt  Also worth noting, you can add extra protein choices to any dish, or swap out the meat selection.  I'm kind of an ahi nut, so when I'm feeling splurgey I add on ahi to my dish. The add-on protein choices include chicken, portobello, steak, ahi, or shrimp."}
{"text":"Please bring back the cinnutella please, beside that great service and great food 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"If only I could pack this place up and take it with me back home!!! Food was seriously on point, healthy creative options for the whole foods loving heart. However, my husband was happy with the splurge on the other side of the menu! Service was great and the girls were super friendly and welcoming. Would highly recommend!!!! A refreshing change of pace from the hustle and bustle of Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm not surprised at the number of reviews this place was made for hipster Yelpers that said it's delicious. I've been a few times. Most recently I had the best breakfast sandwhich of my life. It's decidely on the happy side- egg, bacon, avacado, chipotle sauce on a Hawaiian role. It has some funny name that I can't rememeber."}
{"text":"Much like Lucifer was cast out from Heaven, I was cast out of Elite Status here on Yelp for 2015.  Thus begins my story of redemption in the form of many new and updated reviews, starting with one of my regular haunts of late:  SkinnyFATS.  Sticking with the biblical theme, as you all probably are aware by now SkinnyFATS gives you the option each visit to listen to either the devil or angel on your shoulder when deciding what to eat by choosing from either the \"Happy\" menu or the \"Healthy\" menu.     So if you've ever met me, it will probably come as a surprise that I gravitated towards the Healthy side of the menu.   I've probably tried 75% of the items there.   Some favorites are the Cranburkey which places the increasingly popular thanksgiving meal concept in burger form.   I also like \"3 Healthy Chicks\" from their breakfast menu which is served all day.   It utilizes the same patties from the burger but places them in a breakfast plate format with egg whites and toast.   Every once in a while I've had some overcooked Cranburkey patties, but usually they're moist and delicious.  Other highlights from the healthy menu are the STEAKation (basically a healthy version of a cheesesteak hoagie), Right Stuffed (which was a pleasant surprise as I didn't expect a pepper stuffed with turkey to be so scrumptious), and the Wrap Supastar which is relatively speaking a healthy breakfast burrito option, and not the kind you get at Roberto's at 3 am.  If you end up listening to the Devil on your other shoulder, and come on, this is Vegas afterall, you can go for something on the Happy side.  Nothing says Happy like some fried animal goodness on a bun amirite?  If the Cranburkey is Abel, then Chix on Broadway is Cain, its sinister brother ready to bash its skull in with a slice of bacon.  Fried chicken, BLT, cheddar on brioche.  It's worth poor Burkey's demise.  I also really liked the Cherry Popper burger with its multiple spicy elements (banana peppers, pepperjack, a spicy slaw), but it being surrounded by Hawaiian rolls seals the deal.   Oh and they do a mean sweet potato fry here which goes well with any of the sandwich/burger options.  Lastly I also really enjoyed the Bleu Balsamic which had shaved NY strip steak with tomato, red onion, and bleu cheese with a balsamic glaze.  I thought the combination of flavors all worked well in concert.  A couple disappointments for me were Tu-Nuts and Ahi Srirachi, as I didn't find the Tuna to be as melt in your mouth as I was hoping for, and Brussel Crowe tasted fine, but I didn't think there was enough on the plate to be worth the cost of admission.  Service is always attentive and friendly, and prices are reasonable!  One of my only issues with this location is simply how crowded it can get.  There's limited space and sometimes a very long line.   Adding to this, you'll often get overanxious patrons at the back of the line rushing to reserve themselves a table, leaving those who have already ordered without one.   I've noticed that when everyone just calmly orders and waits their turn, the general flow of those coming/going tends to work out.   Heed that advice and your angel might forgive you for ordering the Chix on Broadway with Sweet Potato fries."}
{"text":"I was obsessed with the Dean Martin location of SkinnyFATS but the long line and game of musical chairs to find a seat during what is supposed to be a stress-free and relaxing lunch break started to wear on me.   One day I decided to see how far off it would be for me to try this location and was surprised to find it takes about the same amount of time to get to from my starting point (UNLV).     What if I told you that the menu, friendly service, and aggravatingly small parking lot all existed at this location, but that you didn't have to wait in a 30 minute line to place an order or reenact the Hunger Games scrum to get a seat?   (cue harps and angels singing)  You can read my review of the Dean Martin location for a more in depth description of the food I tend to order, but one of the great things also about SkinnyFATS is they constantly update their menu (for the better!) and test specials for possible inclusion on future menus.   I'm a happy guinea pig for their experimentations.  My favorite relatively recent discovery here is the Hot Chix bowl which is essentially a buffalo chicken salad.  I find it hard to resist ordering.   The Pimp Shrimp is also awesome especially when stealing an idea from their awesome server Kelly to replace the cucumber boat with brown rice.   That should be another point of emphasis: they are awesome with substitutions!  If you see something on the menu that needs a few personal tweaks, don't be afraid to ask.  My old favorites the Cranburkey and Cherry Popper burger still hold up across locations as well.    Initially visiting this location felt a lot like cheating on the original.  Now over the course of the last year it's become wifey to Dean Martin's mistress status."}
{"text":"Not surprisingly the Happy menu items taste better than the Healthy menu.    We went on a Saturday night and found the service to be very slow and the atmosphere/music too loud to be enjoyable.  It also isn't very wheelchair friendly, if that is an issue for you.  We tried Tu-Nuts - really good but very spicy, even when we asked for the spicy on the side Zucc-It - again tasty but very spicy, even though we asked if it could be toned down More Cow Bowl - a definite must order Pimp Shrimp - so good, we ordered a second while we were there HappyMess - amazing!  Perfect amount of toppings SweetCheeseUs - again so good we ordered another ChiaMisu - was very good but the portion was small Scrambowl - was very boring and not a good ratio of ingredients.    Because the customization requests were not followed, I'm wondering about how much is actually made on site."}
{"text":"I get what they are going for it and its refreshing to see some innovation, but the prices are high and the portions are small. Most of the food is hipster fair (which is certainly the target market) and creative, but its all a little too form over function in my opinion. While the food acceptable I'd rather the focus be on taste rather than being cutesy. It seems like more effort was put into including pretentious ingredients in every item rather than making the best food possible."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything I have tried is delicious. The staff is very friendly. Tucker was awesome. Please open a store in Orange County soon.  Will be back every time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ordered the classic burger medium-well with truffle fries. The burger came out barely cooked and the fries were old and cold. This place has serious cooking and quality control issues."}
{"text":"OMG, the smoothie!!! My friend and I have now eaten there twice. Love that they have a \"healthy/skinny \"version of food as well as the \"fat\" version! I love the sweet potato fries and have had the \"Nice to Greek You\" as well as the \"Balls\"  The atmosphere in the restaurant is fantastic as are the staff! Quickly became a \"Go To\" eatety for me!"}
{"text":"I could seriously eat at this place EVERYDAY! Service is quick & food is fresh. I've come to this location a few times and have yet to be disappointed. The prices aren't crazy expensive and the portions are HUGE."}
{"text":"We went for brunch. This is a small spot so you definitely want to come early to get a table. We tried the juice while we were waiting for our meal and it was excellent.We got the sweet ginger. Their claim to fame is that their juice is affordable and I have to agree: $3 for juice was definitely a perk!  The menu has two sides: a \"healthy\" side and a \"splurge\" side. It is great to have options! I ordered the avocado toast (from the healthy side) and was satisfied. it was one bigger slice of bread with plenty of avocado, sun-dried tomato, feta cheese and an over easy egg. I wasn't a huge fan of the feta cheese on it but it was the perfect amount of food- not too much.  My husband got the chicken and waffles and loved it. I tried the waffle is it was delicious! Needless to say, that was on the splurge side of the menu....  My only gripe is that they do not serve coffee. Luckily we figured this out beforehand so brought our own!"}
{"text":"This is a great concept for a restaurant.  They have a healthy side and happy side.  Get their early for lunch as they don't have but about 15-20 chairs so it can get packed very easily.  I had a the Cherry Popper.  It was delicious.  Truffle fries were good too.  My buddy got the Sweet Cheese Us and he said it was good.  We will return there, but probably to eat on the health side."}
{"text":"1- Spicy Latina - This is the most delicious thing ever!! It may be a little too spicy for some because it really does have a spicy kick to it but it is soooooo worth getting. 2. Sweet Cheese Us - This might have been a bit too overly cheesy for me but the name says it all. The meat is very tender. 3.steakation - the meat is very flavorful. This meal tastes very healthy and earhty. Loved it! 4. Mealtdown - now this puppy is hearty! Lots of meat - the sweet potatoe fries are crunchy which i like. Now this meal is for someone that is very hungry. 5. Chicken and waffles - the chicken is crispy yet tender and juicy with a good seasoning. A very good dish as well.  We live in California and its safe to say we will be back when we go back to Vegas. I wish they had one of these in California!   ****DO NOT LEAVE THIS PLACE WITHOUT TRYING THE SPICY LATINA***"}
{"text":"Really great options on both the healthy and fatty side.  Definitely a tad overpriced and very trendy/hipster. . . I dig it though, foods good but don't expect a bargain"}
{"text":"Good food good prices! It just too small. It's almost like I dread going in because I know I'm going to have a hard time finding a seat and waiting for people to get up."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here on a Saturday night around 8pm.  Not crowded, but not empty, just right.  Its a very small place (maybe 8 tables and a long window table) in an unusual location with no other restaurants around and easy to miss because the sign isn't lighted at night.  Food was really good and service was friendly.  Everything came out hot.  CauliFire was a good, spicy appetizer and I really liked the Vegwich and sweet potato fries.  The Green Mile was also good.  My friends had the Shrimp in a Boat and an eggplant eggs benedict special and they both liked them.  I had a hard time deciding between the Vegwich and Mean Bean.  I hope to have a chance to get try the Mean Bean before I leave Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Above and beyond service. This restaurant was a bit difficult to locate from the street but well worth the search.   The sweet potato fries are really amazing. The burger was done perfectly. Not a huge fan of the ahi taco. It was probably the slaw because the fish and wonton like shell were both cooked and designed excellently."}
{"text":"Breakfast and sandwiches...perfect. This place was so good! The service was great, they were fast and very friendly. We ordered the sweet cheese us, the cherry popper and the wrap superstar. For drinks we ordered iced and hot coffees. The sweet cheese us was soooo good! The burger was good too but I think the cole slaw and banana pineapple peppers took over the taste of the patty. The truffle fries were good too. The decor inside was very cute and the tv was big enough to watch football games. He place is very clean but they only have a few tables. I highly recommend this place and will be back for more."}
{"text":"Food was just ok not great I didn't like the sweet potato fries and burger was just ok fat burger and smash burger way better !!!! The was good but not warm, the juice was good. The place is too pricey for what u r getting. Won't go again."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Fast and friendly. I got the happy chicks and couldn't even finish it. I took it the rest to go and still didn't finish it. That Nutella/berry/banana smoothie was the best. It's a meal within itself"}
{"text":"I've never been one to complain about someone being \"overly helpful\" but this was the case. One of the associates was great, but the second we dealt with was insufferable. We went off of the recommendations we got and order a sweetcheesus sandwich with truffle fries and the naked chicks. The sand which was so-so, but not flavorful and the \"cheese\" sauce was lacking anything resemblance of cheese flavor. For a sandwich going by the name it does, I'd expect more in both flavor and quantity. As for the naked chicks, they were cooked well, but the portion was tiny and the bowl they were served in made hem near impossible to eat. Overall, it was a pretty lackluster experience and we left halfway through the meal to get good food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've come here so many times and have never been disappointed. Fresh, DELICIOUS and unique food at an affordable price. Honestly their whole shtick is brilliant- I often feel like the pretentious friend wanting to choose the \"healthy\" restaurant option when going out with friends, but if we come here, everyone can get what they want. Not to mention the vibe- love the art style, and the music is always amazing. Youthful and upbeat all around. If you're mulling over which place to grab food from right now, choose this place."}
{"text":"If you can't decide if you want to cheat on your diet or eat healthier, SkinnyFATS is the restaurant to choose. With 2 sides to the menu (happy or healthy), even your picky eaters can find something they'd eat.   I went here with a friend; he had a flatbread, and I had the chix on Broadway with truffle fries. The fries were cooked well, and they were salted just right with a subtle truffle flavor, I'd give it an A. The sandwich was flavorful with the mixture of aioli, cheese, and bacon amongst some of the toppings. The only criticism I'd have is that the chicken by itself is somewhat bland, but the combination of flavors when eaten together was delightful.  There was a line when ordering, so we felt somewhat rushed, but the staff was kind overall and laid back. The aesthetics definitely had a hipster/urban vibe, which paired great with the flow of the menu offered.  I will probably be back again to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"If you like trendy joints check it out. The one guy had good customer service since he switched an order to something else nicely. The breakfast not that good. Their specialty are the burgers!! You cant go wrong. The truffle fries are freakin amazing! I requested for sweet truffle fries (sweet potato fries).   The rosemary pancake with 3 strips of bacon was def not worth the money. Coulda made that myself."}
{"text":"This is second time I've been here and the fryer is broke so once again I can't get what I want not to mention that every time I come I have to fight for a table which makes it vary uncomfortable. I will not return until they either get a bigger place and they can seem to fix the fryer."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since others I know enjoy it so much. Unfortunately it was not a good experience and I'm not sure I want to go back even though the menu was interesting. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich that comes with pickles on a Hawaiian bun. The bun was all flat and squished and even though the chicken looked good it was covered with a gigantic blob of drippy, hella spicy, chunky sauce. I've never tried anything so disgusting and I normally like spicy things. After a couple of bites I tried just moving all the grossness to the side, including the soggy bread, so I could just get some chicken, but it was too late. The awful spicy disaster destroyed any remaining taste buds and I have felt on the verge of vomiting ever since.  Only good things I can say is the staff was nice and the sodas were good."}
{"text":"So I've eaten at this location several times and I'm finally writing a review.  Today's dining experience:  Greeted immediately upon arrival and offered help with menu if needed. Although they were very busy, nearly a full house, I had ordered and in my seat within 5-10 minutes easily still. The dining room was clean and being kept clean by busy diligent workers. My cashier was new and being helped to learn the ropes, no biggie, a fellow employee named Patrick was doing a fabulous job of helping her along. Patrick was hands on everything and did a fantastic job from greeting, taking orders, to keeping the place sparkling clean.   Today I ordered the Zucc It dish with a side of jasmine rice that I love to mix all together in the same bowl. Check the menu for the Zucc It ingredients. I do recommend this dish highly especially with the jasmine rice addition.  Delicious. Awesome. Mmmm tasty. I sipped on a passion ice tea also that was delectable as well.   So in short the service was outstanding, the joint was jumping and still clean and flowing easily. The food was delicious and served in a timely manor.  5 star experience today folks."}
{"text":"We tried SkinnyFATS on Warm Springs tonight. I think the Healthy side, Happy side menu is a pretty clever concept. For those who have not been here what that means is the left side of the menu is healthy and the right side is happy. The dining room is really cool with a reclaimed wood look with visually interesting art. The pallet bar stools are cool too. There is also a nice size patio for outdoor seating.     Tonight we had the Caulifire appetizer. It's cauliflower in some sort of franks red hot type of sauce. Very tasty with just the right amount of kick. Next I had the Vegewich as my entree. It is a portobello mushroom sandwich on a wheat bun. It is vegan. Lettuce, tomato, avocado and some sort of vegan sauces dress it up and you get a choice of one side. I also ordered the Mean bean to take home and eat later. It is a veggie bean burger with lettuce, tomato, avocado and a spicy hummus dressing and choice of one side. I ended up eating half of each sandwich and taking home half of each. I am happy to say both were delicious and satisfying.     This is my 4th visit or so to SkinnyFATS and I will definitely be back again. Good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"I used to really love this location, but after discovering the other SkinnyFATS on Warm Springs, it's safe to say that this place needs an upgrade.  For starters, it's small. Even when it's not busy, it's not hard to feel claustrophobic. They're usually quick to turn over the tables, but people are also quick to snatch them up. Last time I was here I sat at the bar type seating by the window. Although the weather was nice that day, I can't imagine sitting there during a summer day when the sun is blazing. The other downside to the small space is that it's so, so noisy. I was sitting right next to my fiance and I had to shout for him to hear me. Also, sitting at the bar area when it's busy sucks, because the line forms right behind you. It's really unpleasant having people breathing behind you while you're trying to eat.   I always seem to have trouble with my food here, too. The first time I came here I got a chicken based meal and a side of rice. The chicken was good, but the rice was cold when it came out. The second time I came here I got a burger, and my burger was cold. Then, this time when I came, I ordered pancakes and they were cold! I'm not sure if my food is easy to make and it sits around while the other food is made, but that was the final straw for me, unfortunately. I will continue to visit their other location, but until this location is upgraded I will be staying far away."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have only ever visited the other location before, so going to this one was like a breath of fresh air. It was so much larger and the service was super fast. I think we ordered and got out food within ten minutes. The cashier was super sweet, and made a point to tell me how cute my engagement ring was, and that I should show it off more often. :-) It was a super great experience, and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Dope ass concept with half of the menu being \"healthy\" items and the other half being the happy fattening deliciousness counterpart.  I ordered all items from the healthy menu:  Ahi Srirachi - A wheat soft taco with seared ahi, bunch of slaw, mango, pico & spicy yo-aioli. It was ehh  STEAKation w/ Truffle Fries - Basically a roast beef sandwich in a sense that uses shaved NY Strip...it was good and had good flavor  Summer Quench - Juice that contains cucumber, celery, apple & lemon...fuck I haven't had fresh pressed juice in a long time and this shit was lightweight refreshing. Little heavy on the celery flavor but it was good  I recommend sitting outside as it has a backyard type of atmosphere to it."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is amazing! The only downside, you have to strategically get a table/chair and if your w/your children it gets challenging! Hope they could add more seating down the road!"}
{"text":"I normally have good experiences at this location. Food is good and normally it is pretty easy to find a table. The last time I went I was a little put off, I asked for a side of ranch when I ordered my food but did not get it. So I asked the runner who brought the food out if she could bring me some. She told me there was a charge for the side of ranch. Now I don't mind, but I had never been charged for ranch any of the other times I came. She was also a little rude and asked me to pay for the ranch before she went and got it \"to save herself a trip.\" It wasn't even busy so I was a little upset she was so demanding about it. She acted like I was bothering her by asking for it. Hopefully next time I has as good of experience as my ones before this one."}
{"text":"Is it strange that the main reason I want to come back to Vegas is to try more things on this menu?? This was probably one of the best meals I have ever had. I had a special called the Southern Comfort and one of the juices. I cant even begin to explain how wonderful everything was! I had a party of 5 so seating was a little tight, but I expected worse for a Saturday morning. I will tell all my friends to come by, and I cant wait to come back and try more!!"}
{"text":"I keep telling friends to try Skinny Fats.  The food is awesome.  Ahi Boat is a favorite.  The smoothies are some of the best Ive had. The menu consists of Healthy items and fun items that are a little on the fat side. Theres usually a crowd.   You wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for the first time around 7 PM on a Tuesday night and we were very pleased with our meal. I had no problem locating the restaurant because I know how to get to Larry Flynt's and I know it's on the same street (you can learn valuable information at bachelor parties occasionally).  There were only two tables in the restaurant at the time which allowed a very friendly staff member the opportunity to explain the menu to us and offer some recommendations. We took our seats, food was delivered to our table, and we were checked on regularly by the staff. Overall, we were happy with the service and timeliness of our meal. We were in and out right around 30 minutes.   My wife had the Nice to Greek You and I ordered the Cherry popper. My wife enjoyed her flatbread with chicken, cucumber, tomato, red onion, olives and tzaziki. A pretty traditional combination but executed well. The human trash compactor in me usually has to finish off most of my wife's meals, but she finished the job on this one. My burger was a little messy, but expected with the egg and slaw, with a nice a little kick of heat. And I don't know too many people who don't like Hawaiian bread.  With a strong first impression, we will be back for sure anxious to try more of the menu probably more from Everything Else Happy side for me."}
{"text":"It's always a good going to SkinnyFATS. I've been to both location since they both opened.   I've tried their Hangover Cure juice & Sweet Ginger. The chickhumm, cranburkey, smoke in a bowl, ahi srirachi, açaí bowl and Portobello Cheesesteak   This visit I decided to try the Mean Bean on the healthy side with a balance of a salted caramel cookie to top off. The Mean Bean looked great, but it was messy once you started to eat it. It started to get really spicy with the Spicy Hummus that was in it. I wish I asked for it on the side, but it was ok.  My friend & I decided to share the Salted Caramel cookie and we asked them to heat it up, but they decided to make us a new one hot and fresh instead. Major Kudos to you guys!"}
{"text":"Yes, a day after trying the Warm Springs location, I had to check out SkinnyFATS again with hubby closer to our home!  If you're unfamiliar with their menu I call it the good and evil menu - there's healthy options and then an evil indulgent version on the other side of the menu.  Food: Hubby decided to go with the \"Secret menu\" with Hot Mess nachos - delicious buffalo chicken tenders with fresh jalapeños and tortilla chips with cheese sauce, pico, and sour cream. I went with the cucumber boat meal of \"Tu-Nuts\" with Ahi tuna, eel sauce and spicy mayo with Asian relish - YUM! ... Admittedly we shared the Drunken monkey cakes... 3 hot cakes with bananas foster and whipped cream and chocolate chips and marshmallows... And applewood smoked bacon.   ... Tomorrow is a two-a-day workout, yes  Service and environment: maybe we're still excited on the \"moving-to-Vegas\" high, but we're excited to have a place like SkinnyFATS close to home. TONS of healthy options, fresh ingredients, amazing variety and fun on the menu. Also, the staff was very patient and friendly to welcome us in, tell us about the secret menu, and even help make decisions. The restaurant is quaint and smaller so best to come during a non-rush time to enjoy everything.  ... Balance the healthy with the treats.. That's what life's about right?"}
{"text":"My good friend Nadine brought me to Skinny FATS and I LOVE the concept!  I think of the menu as the \"good versus evil\" where you have a healthy food option and can be indulgent and also try it's 'evil twin!'  Food: I tried the Ahi tuna tacos - one from each side of the menu - and loved each one! Two was enough to eat for me! I also tried the truffle fries which were delish and perfect to share.  Staff: Super friendly and outgoing! They listened to my 5 million questions and were very polite to us at the table!  Environment: I love the indoor and outdoor seating and the ability to sit at the community table with other locals trying our this delicious restaurant!  I definitely want to come back- I had my eye on the red velvet brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. I have ordered from here several times and have NEVER been disappointed! They have a wonderful menu and I wish I could eat here everyday. The filet o fire is absolutely delicious. The bomb diggity is amazing (I used the garlic sourdough instead of regular sourdough) I have tried both truffle and sweet potato fries, both are good. Sweet potato fries win though."}
{"text":"Love this place they have amazing food and you can go wrong with there decor super affordable and fun perfect for lunch or late dinner"}
{"text":"Always good vibes at skinny fats. The food is creatively delicious and every time I visit I am tempted to try the whole menu, but I do also have my usual orders that MORE than satisfy my taste buds. I usually go to the Durango/Warm Springs location, but we decided to give this location a shot. The cleanliness of this establishment is superb. The food is amazing, and the staff is incredibly friendly and I saw some familiar faces f m the Durango location. If you live in Vegas or are visiting you have to EAT at skinnyfats it's a true and cherished gem of an eatery :)"}
{"text":"This place is our second kitchen. I have two teenagers,  this place has a great positive vibe. Very kickback and so much better alternative than any fast food for my growing, always hungry adolescents."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food and service! I'm glad to see them growing, they're clearly \"doing it right.\""}
{"text":"I'd give the food and the \"idea\" of having a \"skinny (healthy)\" side and a \"happy (not so heathy LOL)\" side, 5 stars!    I mostly tried items off the Healthy side as I try to be healthier when eating out.  I will admit that the dishes are GOOD!  The Juan Healthy breakfast burrito is huge!  Also, the sweet potato fries with feta and chicken breast is also delicious!  If you follow these guys on Instagram you'll see their daily (weekly) specials.  I imagine they are advertised at the restaurant as well.    The only reason why I gave 4 stars instead of 5, is because the place is really tiny and seating is very limited.  But I mostly do carry out anyway.  :)  Give it a try!  Especially if your health conscious."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Amazing food (I highly recommend the chicken parm, smotherload burrito, and an extra order of truffle fries for whatever you get.) The menu is a little weird by not mentioning what's a burger, sandwich, etc, but that doesn't even matter. Go check this place out."}
{"text":"Awesome! My family and I loved this place. We really liked the fresh options, it was really hard to choose which meal to try. This just means we will be back to try everything. I had the cherry popper burger ( think it was called that) and wife the shrimp taco with quesadilla shell. All was amazingly good and was able to share with our toddler son. Our son also had a great time looking at the colorful decor. This place will definitely be our new go to spot."}
{"text":"Awesome food and I'm so happy they opened a location on the north side of Vegas!! As always, the cherry popper does not disappoint. The spicy Latina soup is also really delicious and savory and i love the tortilla sticks dipped in!"}
{"text":"Came here twice during the week of CES.   On our first visit, I came in wanting to order the grilled cheese and tomato soup. I was told they were completely out of the soup, but I decided to order the grilled cheese by itself anyway. My husband ordered a Naked chix bowl and we also got truffle fries to share. For drinks we also got a liquid defense and SkinnyFats Punch (I initially wanted a Delightful Cucumber which I saw on their website but was told they don't have that drink anymore...should probably take it off the website). My husband also decided to try an oatmeal raisin cookie (his favorites).  My grilled cheese was very good, but kind of felt like it was missing the tomato soup. But husband and I both agreed and that it was definitely worth coming back for.  My husbands Naked chix bowl left much to be desired. It looked nothing like the pictures and ended up being \"too saucy\" for his taste. The first bite he said was good, but he soon got tired of it a few more bites in. He didn't even finish half the bowl.  The fries were very good, drinks were good, though my Punch was more of a slushy/icee consistency than a juice. I was also told all the drinks are pre-made and can't be adjusted.  My husband said the oatmeal cookie was pretty bad. It tasted hard and old.  On our second night, they had the tomato soup so we both ordered tomato soup and grilled cheese with truffle fries again.  For some reason, the truffle fries seemed like they were taking a very long time to come out and when they finally did, they tasted cold (as if they were left forgotten in the window). We mentioned it to the server and he offered to take them back and get us new ones. While we waited on the fries, our soup and grilled cheese came out. For future reference, one cup of the soup is more than enough to share between two people. I'm not sure we would have even finished one had we shared! Taste-wise  it was ok. It honestly kind of tasted like a can of tomato paste that was heated up and slightly watered down to a soupy consistency. The grilled cheese was great just like the night before.   Our fries, again, took forever to come out. We had completely finished our meals and asked the server if they were still coming out. He said he would double check. We were just about to tell him to just cancel them when they came out.   Overall, if I have a craving for a good grilled cheese on sourdough bread, I'd come back....it was that good. I'd be interested in trying some of their other items as well."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend the other day...  pros- good and fresh food at low prices... big portions... tasty... clean... bathrooms... friendly service... Cons- small parking lot  I had the turkey burger... it was huge, I could only finish half... my husband and I also shared the fish tacos... the ahi srirachi was a little too spicy for me(I can't eat anything spicy at all) and the ahi taco San... that was the best fish taco I've ever had!!!  We also got some cookies- fresh and crunchy but chewy in the middle... and their homemade ketchup was good!  We also had to get the strawberry chia thing- it was a perfect blend of strawberry and coconut... Definitely will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to place. Food is always fresh, servers are friendly and I love the rotating menu board. Some day I'll manage to try every eggs Benedict they offer on the weekends. #lifegoals"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times before and I never ordered anything that disappointed me. Came here on Sunday for lunch and it was packed. It took quite a while to place an order but the wait was worth it. Ordered the big parm sandwich which was delicious and juicy not dry. Also got the SkinnyFats punch which was surprisingly better than I thought it would be. Also tried the spudgetti which is basically a loaded baked potato in shredded form it was delicious and I think it's gonna be my go to dish from now on."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I had the turkey burger (forgot the clever name) and truffle fries. It was the bomb.com. Very clean restaurant and the staff were very nice and friendly too! Win win"}
{"text":"Being an avid fisherman all my life, I always try the seafood entrees everywhere I go.  I just tried the TeriAHI sandwich with brown rice and I must say, WOW! The AHI was perfectly seared leaving the middle exactly how it's supposed to be. The staff was also very sweet and uplifting. My family felt very welcomed here. I will definitely be back here time and time again!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is in the middle of nowhere.  I eat out for lunch almost everyday at work, so I try to find new places when I can, and yelp did not let me down.    I really like this place.  There's two halves to the menu.  If I want to watch my figure (hardly ever happens), I can get something off the healthy menu.  Or if I'm my usual fattie self, I'll choose the happy side.  That said, I tried the Ahi Taco-San, and I was blown away.  I really liked the sriracha slaw (sriracha really makes everything great), and the mango salsa made it even better.  So I loved this spot so much, I searched for their Facebook, and there's a challenge to try everything off their menu.  Once you finish that, you get 10% off for life.  Challenge accepted!"}
{"text":"Good healthy food, nice ambiance, though as many places are doing right now, the lighting may be a little low for my old eyes, other than that, a quick meal well made and not at a silly price, I like the place a lot."}
{"text":"Loved the food from this place. I am so glad that when I go back home I have a place to come and grab a good bite to eat. The food is bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Not much to say. My family and I went thru on 11 Dec. I had the chicken and waffles which wasn't bad but the chicken was dry and bland. Wife had the Cheese steak sandwich which she didn't like an my daughter had the pancakes which she loved(what kid doesn't like pancakes?). For the 3 of us it was $46.07 and after my military discount it was $40.07 which is still to expensive in my opinion. We will try it again only because my wife believes in second chances. If it was my call, it would be duces."}
{"text":"FIRST OFF, i'm so glad this location is 2 miles away from me. that is really a plus! i love the vibe in this place -- it's just very fresh and fun! outdoor sitting is my favorite!  FOOD is boooomb! my personal favorites are the BERRY STRONG WAFFLE, HAPPY MESS and CRANTURKEY BURGER. TRUFFLE FRIES and SWEET POTATO FRIES are soooooo good! love that they you get to choose between healthy and outrageous food choices. i always decide on what to order based on my mood LOL but this place is just so much fun and so much good food!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered Kalefornia Love, Smoke in a Bowl, Cauli(flower)fire, and STEAKation. Except the Kalefornia Love salad with chicken and portobello was decent, all other dishes were horrible. Smoke in a Bowl and STEAKation burger were totally plain, while the Caulifire was way toooooo salty and spicy. Note that I can eat pretty spicy and I specifically asked them to go light on the buffalo sauce on the cauliflower, since it was for my mom, who prefers less strong flavor.  The juices/shakes were good. We asked for Beet It without basil or ginger, and a shake Mr. Green with banana, chocolate and whey protein.  I am generally a big fan of healthy food and have been to healthy food restaurants that are way better than this. Maybe it's not a good idea to divide the menu to a \"healthy side\" vs. a \"happy side\". You can be healthy and happy at the same time."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! A little hard to find as it's stuck in a business park, and there's not a ton of seating so it can get crowded in the Saturday morning brunch crowd, but food is delicious."}
{"text":"So after my colleagues have been raving about this place for the past few weeks me and the hubs decided to check it out.  He got Buff Chix and Chix on Broadway.  Both were pretty good.. I got the Chick-A-Waff-A-Dopolis.. It was pretty good.. I would however not say it's def some place you should go out of your way for.  But it was decent.  The staff there was super nice and helpful.  The place is super small and its first come first serve seating.  So if you're coming with a big party or trying to bring your whole family 4 or 5+ you might have to wait awhile unless you get lucky and find seats available right away.  Overall the food was decent."}
{"text":"First and last time this joint will see me or my money! I'm not a health food type but Try to avoid fats, so I ask for My bacon well done! Unfortunately it was All fat. We observed every worker in violation of health code by using same rag to clean tables and chairs even after  We said something. One guy tried to tell me he used not rags in his hand but, I was  Watching him and he lied to my face saying he used both. Then he took offense when I said you are lying . By the way no Coke or Diet Coke  just cola ugh"}
{"text":"We have been here twice since they have opened.   Both times AMAZING. Like seriously AMAZING. Both times the wait to order is a bit on the long side, but finding a seat and time until you get your food is very very quick! So I'll just be patient.   Their sodas are amazing. Birch beer, yes, please.   My family has some pretty significant food allergies, so eating out is difficult, especially when things are not all made in house, from scratch. But this place was able to accommodate all of our crazy allergies, no epipen or Benadryl required. That is huge! What that means for you, (if you don't have allergies) is that you're not eating crap. You're getting real food. Like REAL, food.   So far we have eaten wakey happy(scrambled eggs, bacon and toast), mini moo(kids burger, and fries), skinny cluck (? Kids seared chicken, fruit, and honey mustard) nice to Greek you, (flat bread, grilled chicken, onions, tomatoes, balsamic dressing and Greek sauce who's name I am blanking), smoke in a bowl (BBQ grilled chicken, cauliflower rice, sautéed onions and peppers, cilantro yo and my husband got it with mango salsa instead of beans, Phenomenal, will be ordering again, and again) and buff chick (buffalo chicken, and truffle fries, PERFECTION.)  All were amazing! Kids meals are reasonably priced especially given the amount of food.   We will be returning. Often."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp in a cucumber boat thing that was absolutely amazing, by far one of the best things I have ever eating in a long time."}
{"text":"Loved it! I got the Slow Boat to China, Ahi Srirachi, Fresh Morning Sandwich  And Mr. Flapjack. Wow!!! It was only $30. The slow boat to china was my favorite and the fresh morning sandwich was a great too! Yumm, and they deliver!! Id highly recommend ordering just one of each so you can try a little of everything (example only get 1 ahi taco instead of 3, then its cheap)"}
{"text":"I got the sweet cheese us with truffle fries and it was AMAZING! We actually liked the restaurant on Facebook so we could keep up with their specials. I'm so glad a friend recommended we try it. It was in an odd place that wasn't overly easy to find...but incredibly worth it. The way it's set up may throw you off too...like an upscale fast food joint.  The food absolutely and in no way tasted like crap fast food though. The entire staff was super friendly and helpful to us newbies. :) The boyfriend and I are making plans to go back for the next special...which I hope is this amazing tomato bisque...please bring back the bisque!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"I love SkinnyFATS but I have to say that they must lose a lot of biz.  Unless you want take-out, the odds of scoring a table is pretty bad.  I find myself waiting in line, stalking the diners with my eyes to see if anyone is close to leaving.  Then I jump out of line to snag a dirty table, leaving my partner to order everything.  EXPAND please!  Having said that, today I tried the Tunuts - the bomb!  Everything there is very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and absolutely loved it!! Had the sweet potato fries, shrimp in and boat along with the GOAT salad, which had fillet mignot and didn't disappoint! Def coming back here to try out more things!"}
{"text":"I'm not from Vegas and I don't live here but I was in town for the ACM awards and was sick of eating on the strip. A short uber ride and I had one of the best burgers of my life and definitely the best soda. Obviously I went for the fat side hahaha but it was worth every minute I spent on the treadmill the next 3 days burning it off"}
{"text":"What a place. Crowded at lunch so took it to go. Order was hot, fresh and healthy. Not cheap, but you definitely get your money's worth. Staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"We find SkinnyFATS on yelp as we headed towards Las Vegas airport and what a find. Their menu has a healthy side and happy side on their menu. I had a healthy chicken with mango over jasmine rice and randy had a big traditional hamburger and fries. We both employed our food as well as admiring all the other food brought out. Small space with limited seating but thankfully we got there 5 min before the rush. We definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"Awesome food & super friendly staff! Ordered the Phatty Philly & it was delicious. The truffle fries were amazing. It does get busy & seating is limited but overall a great experience."}
{"text":"First time at this location & it was just as awesome as all the other times I've visited the Dean Martin location! Great food & service! So many must tries! Just gotta keep going back!!!"}
{"text":"Everything I have tried on the menu has been delicious and staff is kind and funny."}
{"text":"Stopped by the new store around the corner. Walked in to a clean restaurant and welcomed by the staff. I ordered the Happymess and husband ordered the Sweet Cheese Us with a side of sweet potato fries.   We left nothing on our plates. There was a little too much blue cheese on my meal but nonetheless I enjoyed it. Will be back for breakfast this weekend. Two sides the the menu: healthy and happy.  You can take out or eat in even order online. Open concept sitting. Non branded sodas. Tried the regular cola and cream soda. Not exactly Coke or Pepsi but pleasant tasting. Was pretty busy for a Thursday night."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 5 stars since it was such a fun place to go and the staff were so friendly. They have a lot of options, but for some reason I couldn't really find what I wanted. So...I asked for a mix of a skinny and a happy breakfast sandwich. While I wouldn't order it again, I thought it was good. They even give a military discount, which is pretty sweet in my book!"}
{"text":"Met up with a couple friends from HI on a Tuesday night, about 740 to be exact. THANK GOODNESS because of the time of day and day of the week, no line. We walk in and although we did not say it, I know we were all surprise to see how small it actually was in there.   See, I'm torn about giving this place 4 stars vs the 3 stars i gave. I wasnt wowed after hearing of all the hype. Perhaps i have to try something else in order to up the star. But I'll give it 3 stars for now because there was no line, customer service was great, and my actual meal was not bad at all. So it isn't like a 3 star with a negative opinion towards the place.  Before I forget, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT coming here with a large load of people to eat and socialize. Why? It's a very fitting place as in it fits what it needs to. Our table was literally a-out-your-seat and a step to to the counter. You may come with your gang, but have no where to sit without being seperated. I say come here with a couple of your friends for a casual lunch or dinner. Also, DO NOT COME IN HERE WITH A STROLLER, INFANT CARSEAT, DON'T EVEN OPT FOR A HIGH-CHAIR.  It would be your luck you come on a busy day with item(s) in tow. I think there were only two or 3 tables that fit 4 people. Everything else were 2 person seating or the bar seating. You have been warned coming from a mother of 4.  Anyway, I ordered the sweet cheese us with the truffle fries. I enjoyed my meal. It was pretty good. I actually like their rendition of a philly cheesesteak than the actual philly cheesesteak itself. However, I wouldn't order this to-go. The bread would probably sog up quick and your fries would not taste that great. You must eat here to thoroughly enjoy your food while it is still fresh. Do not attempt to eat here as your first time but take it to go...I'm pretty sure you'll end up disappointed. Then you'll end up typing out an unfair review.  The meat in my sandwich was super tender and the banana and cherry peppers went together perfectly. My one friend had the parmesan sandwich, forgot the actual name, and his wife had the meat flatbread or something like that.   Her meal look disappointing because it didn't look that big at all. I'm pretty sure she was still hungry afterwards because by the looks of it, think I'd be hungry too. Honestly, after eating my meal I felt as though I was still hungry...but as the night progressed I felt just right. Not full at all, but not starving. But I'm \"little\" so I can't speak the same for all.   I do want to head back to explore their menu for sure. They do have a menu that leaves you wanting to do just that. I'll probably pick an odd day and time to avoid lines as seen in the reviews. To be honest, though, I don't think the food is worth such a line. If I had to wait and wait and wait just to order my food then worry about where to sit afterwards...I'd give this place 2 or 3 stars just for it not being worth the wait because of the price and perhaps portioning. I haven't explored their menu to really gripe about portioning, but my friend is a pretty bulky guy and he was still hungry.   I did think it had a cute vibe to it. Love their menu and what they did with the place. But, it felt like it was a little extra dark than necessary. I wish they brightened it up a bit without losing the effect they want. I couldn't really read my menu too well. Which is probably why I hurried and ordered because the astigmatism was kicking in. Lol.  Lousy Night vision was in total effect.   I would recommend this place for someone to try if they were looking to explore a different kind of menu. Just not so sure what to make of all the hype just yet. After a few visits of trying other menu items will I be able to make such judgment. But tonight as first impression, not convinced. Can't wait to get my mind changed!"}
{"text":"The menu here is superb everything is a must try for the foodie. Breakfast is served all day so that's a plus. The restaurant is a little chic hide away. You can't miss it with the big yellow smiley face on the outside. Fresh pressed juices that you can create your own. I think I may be eating here as often as possible to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"So good!  I first had a sample of SkinnyFats was at a Yelp event.  Had a seminar on this side of town.  Needed a lunch option.  After spending 20 minutes in line to order, I decided to order two of the ahi srirachi tacos (skinny style). They were $3.95 a piece.  (not going to lie, this place is hopping.  Be prepared to wait and maybe no place to sit.  It's just too good.)  I wanted to also try a full version of Liquid Defense pressed juice.  OMG, so good. ORANGE, CARROT, APPLE, LEMON, LIME, BASIL and 231 calories. Yes, the price of $7.95 is not for the faint of heart.  But, man, oh man, it is so good.  I should have gotten the large and not the medium.  I wanted to lick the bottom of the glass."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The menu selection and variety is very well balanced. The guy at the register was very knowledgable of the menu and I think his name was Lynel. He definitely was excited to tell us about the menu! Definitely will be back. The cherry bomb burger and ahi sirracha tacos were great"}
{"text":"Was in town for work and had a hankering for something healthy & found this joint on Yelp! Website Sold me! Food looked great, sounded fresh and remotely healthy.   I ordered two tacos (Ahi Sirachi & Shrimp Tacodilla) with side of fresh fruit and to drink I got the ginger and beet juice. Great layout with funky fun decor! Food came out fast and fresh! These were some bomb.com Tacos!!!!!!! Man oh man party time in my mouth! Food was so good that I immediately thought \"We NEED one in San Diego!\"   Cannot wait to come back into town because I have found a new Fave in Vegoose!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Such great food that not only looks delicious (and something out of a magazine), but also isn't terrible for you. I was warned that this place was busy, and even at an off time it was, but it was so worth it. Can't wait to come back here with the hubby!"}
{"text":"There's absolutely nothing bad to say about SkinnyFats!! I am a regular for their Benedict specials every weekend...or, if too spicy, I have tried just about everything else on the menu that isnt...  I continue to be happy now that I have the option of enjoying more seating at their newest location off Decatur and 215...  Service is always on par, food is an event every time for my tastebuds...I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Employees are so remarkably nice and helpful. The food is on the expensive side, but you get a lot and it's good quality, fresh, and delicious. Really cool atmosphere, and despite being busy as all get out, the food always comes out in a timely manner. Also, their sweet potato fries are just tops. Everything else could suck and I'd still give em a good rating just for those fries."}
{"text":"I sincerely hope mine is an isolated incident, because it was one of the most disappointing lunch experiences I've had, in quite some time. Let me put it this way, the single star is obligatory, with the review.   This place, and I understand they have another location, is small; that has no real bearing on the review, it just played into the bad experience (it'll make sense by the time I'm done). We ordered our food and I got the Bleu Balsamic, also ordering the sweet potato fries. My wife ordered the Sweet Cheese Us and truffle fries. Simple enough order, if only it had been a simple, enjoyable meal. Again, this place is small and there were a total of four of us in our party, since it was crowded we chose to sit at the table outside; they assured us they would bring our order to us.   A mere forty (yes 4-0 minutes) later our food was finally on its way, which we only found out, because we intercepted the server looking for us. We had to wait another 5 minutes for our friends food, which we soon learned had been ready, but set aside, and promptly forgotten. What's worse, we had to ask for the food, and were told it was coming out; this wasn't the case, so when we asked again, we were told we needed to present the receipt (that would be the receipt they never provided).  We pointed this out to the server and they did look and then locate our missing items. They commented when they handed it to us that it had been ready for us for a half hour but they didn't have a name; probably has something to do with not asking for a name when they took the order (small detail (you may be picking up on the sarcasm by now, sorry I'm compensating for my still growling stomach)).  As you can imagine the now thirty minute old Sweet Cheese Us (their version of a cheese steak) was served up on the most incredibly soggy bread. Hey, if you're into soggy bread that's great; not my thing and my wife bravely endured, but it wasn't good (yes, I tasted it and it was not good). In all fairness it may have been an okay sandwich, if the bread had been in better shape, but it still would have only been okay; not great.   The truffle and sweet potato fries were, as you can guess, cold and actually not particularly well prepared. I think they were, at least for me, undercooked and sort of limp.    Now, as for my sandwich.  First, it wasn't a sandwich. It also wasn't a salad, as there wasn't any lettuce. It was a bun less sandwich, or a protein style sandwich but in a bowl like a salad; sans the lettuce. I guess my primary issue is, it wasn't on the healthy side of the menu, it was on the happy side of the menu. Aside from that, nothing indicated it was not a sandwich; almost everything, on that half of the menu was a sandwich and nothing indicated otherwise (I've included a picture of the menu, you be the judge). It's redeeming quality was the generous inclusion of Bleu cheese, but aside from that it was a rather plain roast beef, an equally plain balsamic dressing, and a few overly ripe slices of tomato lacking in flavor.   The only other redeeming quality was the cup they serve their beverages in, decent quality, with a nice lid, even a sturdy enough straw. I guess the worst part of the experience (if it could be worse and it was) is that we were vocal about our unhappiness and asked for the manager's name; Amanda was the name provided. Now, I mean vocal about our displeasure, not rude; despite this (if the evidence isn't already there) apparently customer service is not their strong suit. I'd have expected at least a polite apology from the manager, but alas she didn't even make an appearance.   In summary, disappointing food, poor service, ambiguous menu, lousy experience; so bad I'm not sure I could convince myself to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Skinnyfats is a terrific mix of healthy and semi-unhealthy (happy) and really caters to almost everyone.  There are a ton of healthy options and that showed with the majority of the fitness clientele who were there during my late 2:30pm lunch.  I thought it would be pretty slow around this time but it was packed.  I got the \"Cranburkey\" (special recipe turkey burger dressed with arugula, tomato, red onion and a cranberry basil yogurt spread on a 9 grain bun) which was very good.  The highlight was definitely the cranberry basil yogurt spread and this set it apart from the hundreds of turkey burgers I've eaten.  The patty had good flavor and I wouldn't hesitate to order this again.    I had a choice of truffle fries, sweet potato fries (no more parsnip) or a salad.  To keep it healthy, I should have gone with the salad but I am glad I didn't because they have the GREATEST sweet potato fries I have ever had.  I am sure they were made in house.  The little crystals of sugar on them really took it to another level.  No condiments were necessary with those.  I can't believe I took that many sentences to talk about sweet potato fries but they were really awesome!  My skinny wife that never gains any weight ordered from the \"happy side\" of the menu.  She ordered the \"Chix on Broadway\".  Is it a wonder this tasted better than the Cranburkey????  Maybe because it was fried chicken with bacon, cheddar, lemon mayo on a brioche roll but that's just a hunch.  The batter and the fry of the chicken was atypical.  The breading itself was thin so it wasn't your traditional fry but it was still very good.     I got a large \"Mr Green\" drink which was a mix of spinach, parsley, kale, romaine lettuce, celery, cucumber, cilantro, apple.  This was probably the first and last green drink I will have with cilantro.  I'll order this again without it as that was the most prevalent flavor next to apple juice.  I do love the majority of green drinks in the world though.  There were 2 options for complimentary water.  One was strawberry basil and the other was raspberry lemon and both were very refreshing.  The space is inviting and set up nicely.  The designer definitely maximized the area.  It just goes to show that if a business offers an excellent product, people will come from anywhere to have it even if they're located in an industrial park on Dean Martin next to a strip club."}
{"text":"Cold, fun food. Concept is cool but being served lukewarm dishes was not appealing. Cauliflower rice should be hot and anything with arrabiata sauce should also be served piping hot. Prices are fair, plenty of easy parking, and all of the employees are nice. It took about 10 minutes to get our cold dishes. Not worth the effort. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The Slow Boat to China is crazy good. The service is great, and this place is almost always busy. Both locations are fantastic. I'm not a big fan of the sliced steak, it's pretty mediocre, but they are super creative in mixing flavors and in their presentation."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant. I wanted the Thai Salad, but it came with fish. I don't like fish so I asked if they could switch it for chicken. They said no problem!! Wish I had this place closer to me. So many healthy options! Vegan, Vegetarian and even Gluten Free."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!   I was honestly turned off by the name \"Skinny Fats\" because it sounded like it might be a \"Heart Attack Grill\" kind of place, but it's completely different, and I'll explain what I love about it.   *I love how friendly the hostess is, Mariana I think was her name.   *I love that they have a \"Healthy/Low Calorie\" menu AND a \"Fatty\"-- but still fairly healthy menu as well.   *I love the fact that they have very good coffee, in real mugs, with free refills, and the mugs, as strange as this may sound, are really enjoyable to drink from. Specifically the top of the mug just fits your mouth better. Again-- I know that probably sounds really strange, but I think you'll know what I mean when you try them.   *I love the food!! I had the breakfast sandwich (I forget what it was called) and it was delicious and just $8.95. It also came with a side order of your choice. I chose the sweet potato fries (mainly because they are healthier) but my friend got the house potatoes and the house potatoes were delicious!   *I even liked the fact that the men's room had a unique hand dryer different than any I have seen before.   *The seating is very comfortable as well (large booths with comfortable backing).  *I could go on with things that I like and or love about this place, but I will leave it at the fact that the prices are very affordable for the quality of food and the experience you have.    This is an easy 5 star review and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for lunch and was quite impressed. I have been here before but last time I had the hummus and it wasn't so great. This time I opted for a different healthy option and got the whole wheat protein waffle with fresh strawberry's, mint yogurt and turkey/cranberry sausage. It was surprisingly good and still I felt good for eating healthy! The cranberry turkey sausage was weird because the cranberries were inside and they were really dry. It tasted okay but if you are looking for deliciousness you will not find it in those cranburkey sausages.   My friends and I shared the sweet potato fries and I really recommend them, they are in some olive oil and rosemary seasoning and they are really good. They also give you free cucumber water here which I always enjoy to stay hydrated throughout my day.  The staff was really friendly and helpful with ordering and finding the restrooms.  The menu here is great because it has options for everyone, people cheating, people being good and vegans too.  I will for sure go back and try some more healthy options another time!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots to eat at when I am in Vegas. Great concept, great food ! I tend to stay on the happy side, and I have not had one questionable item on the menu yet ! A Vegas must go !"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The atmosphere is pretty good and the food is as well. My only complaint is their coffee. It's pretty bad. Super bitter even when you add creamer and sugar"}
{"text":"We're from out of town, and came across this place on yelp. We decided to try it, and omg its amazing. They're so creative with their dishes & unique. I had the \"More Cow Bowl\" and the steak was extremely tender and rich in flavor. The country fried steak was the best we have had. The biscuits were sweet then spicy, also the steak was super tender. We will definitely be back once we're in town"}
{"text":"Truly one of the best restaurants to dine in Las Vegas! This hidden gem is right next to the freeway, and incorporates a healthy side as well as a \"happy\" side, which is the best of both worlds when your trying to be health conscious or in for a cheat day!   Clever concept, definitely coming back and bringing all the friends and family."}
{"text":"Came here with my co-works from Express when I used to work at the Forum Shops. It's great that they have two options, the skinny healthy options (which I'm a fan of) but they also have options for the cheat meals (which is always good to have here and there) which is the reason why I can't stay away. Will be back, and will bring my friends and family to try out the amazing one of a kind restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow I didn't expect this place to be so good. It is a little trendy but I don't mind. Service is extraordinary and it really shows in the attitude of the people who go to eat here. Great food, and they keep this place super clean."}
{"text":"As good as I remembered! Enjoyed the original SkinnyFATS a few year back and always told people going to Vegas to eat there! Those that did were never disappointed! So when our trip to Zion took us past North Vegas I was so happy to see a restaurant right off the freeway & we stopped in! I had the Cherry Pepper Burger & this is a 6 napkin burger! AMAZING! Sweet potatoes fries were perfectly cooked! My BF has the Sriracha Ahi Tuna tacos & loved them! Left Happy and SATISFIED!"}
{"text":"Wow! What an awesome selection of healthy food  and it's pretty tasty   Make a stop here if your in town it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations now and have ordered lunch through their website, which is what I always recommended for this location. However this past time I wasn't pleased with the food nor the service. online ordering is very user friendly. it allows you to place an ASAP order or schedule the time of pickup. I placed my order for an 11:40 pickup. it didn't end up coming out until closer to 12! what's the point of scheduling a time if they are unable to commit?  again to reiterate I've been here multiple times and have order a variance of items. However I am starting to find their food to be very blain and light on the quantity of it, especially their breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"I often stay with the healthy choices from this place but love the whole concept. They are there for you when you know summer is coming and need to stay with the low calorie choices or for the days you are hungover and need to indulge in some 'happy' food. Tonight's pick consisted of the following:  Caulifire - this is amazing and although it's listed as an appetizer I can definitely eat this as a light meal. The cauliflower tasted as if it was on the barbie, the smokey taste and then tossed in buffalo sauce. The sauce that comes with it helps cool down the temp but it will definitely linger after biting into it.   Flat Chix - my honest thoughts, I didn't really care for this salad & it probably has to do with the fact I'm not a fan of capers. I did say no capers but realized the dressing had capers but didn't think it could be bad only bc a balsamic glaze was with it too. The chicken was cooked perfectly though. The problem here is that I had my mind in a salad they don't serve anymore; Kalefornia."}
{"text":"Love this place! Cute inside, nice little outside patio with umbrellas. Friendly staff and very helpful for us first time guests who were confused!    Their menu ranges from healthy to not so healthy. We got the tu nuts. It was delicious! Everything actually Looked good that they were bringing out and the menu has breakfast as well. I would recommend trying this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious Sweet potato fries!!! Crispy and sweet almost tasted like maple!   It was very busy on a Sunday afternoon.  Had adorable ambience."}
{"text":"Man I love this place they have soo many great options to chose from ! Never get disappointed when coming here !"}
{"text":"Called to ask about menu, for some reason \"couldn't\" make ginger shot yet could make ginger pressed with anything else? Anyways told her that we will be there in a second, drive 6 miles to get there.. door unlocked, and we walk up to order and told \"oh yeah we're closed... Sorry\". (Mind you that it is 1 minute past) Explained that we just got off the phone and nobody mentioned closing, but they had no intentions on taking care of us with a simple drink. Rest of staff looked at her confused why she would not try to fix the situation. Just shrugged shoulders. Thank you so much.  [UPDATE] Was contacted by someone from the business and appreciated the quick response/apology to our complaint. Was offered to come back in future to make up for the problem. Will update again when return."}
{"text":"LOVE the fact they pulled out Cicis pizza and gave people the option to eat healthier! They also off a \"Happy\" menu for the people who don't care for eating healthy. The food is amazing and this place has a cool newer modern atmosphere. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"I've visited 3 times since my last review and I'm not sure when I will return. Each visit I needed to send an item back, because an item was not cooked properly, all 3 times almost completely dry burgers. This time 7/26/17 I ordered the steakation (or something like that). What the steak is marinated in was very salty. My fries were the same...too salty. I had to use a napkin to remove some of the salt, finally asking a server if the could make more fries with less salt. The fruit salad has been around for a while. I can only assume from the appearance is that this comes from a package and not prepared fresh daily. Sorry, I really used to be in love with this place...Things are changing."}
{"text":"I'm still thinking about their CRANBURKEY burger and their special spicy ketchup a month after my visit. That's how delicious their food are.   It was tricky to locate their place in the first place, we thought we drove into someone's warehouse. Turned out their restaurant is inside of an office like building. The interior was cute, medium sized with a lot of tables and high bars. Food ordering has never been that easy for me as they have skinny and fatty choices where they labeled all the calories on the menu. (Oh my MFP thank you! )   I had their turkey burger and some skinny soup of the day, my SO ordered the classic burger and I took the big bite of his out of \"I must try your food\" curtsy. I actually like my cranburkey better as it has very interesting Cranbury flavor, it went very well with their spicy ketchup. I wasn't the big fan of my soup of the day, though, it tasted just like any ordinary cafeteria soup even though it was in a fancy cute soup cup.   Their price is reasonable and their attendants seemed genuinely happy and welcoming. I just wish they open more shops other than the Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and we loved it. Very friendly staff. Options for the healthy hunter as well as the ravenous routine. Plus I discovered their \"jãlatcha\". A perfect marriage of ketchup and jalapeños. So delish. Wish this was back home. Thanks Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about this place from friends, but when I tried it I wasn't blown away by the food. However, this is probably because I'm a pescetarian so I didn't have many options to choose from on the menu. We asked the cashier if there were more vegetarian options and he was very helpful by notifying us of other dishes not listed on the menu in the store, so I ended up ordering a veggie burger. The sauce was good but the patties themselves were not special, so it's not something I'd order again. My sister had the Shroomin' in Philly sandwich which she enjoyed, and we both really liked the truffle fries.   After looking at the online menu, I noticed that there were actually more vegetarian options that sounded tasty and I would like to try, so I do want to come back again. Their breakfast meals also seem promising.   The service made the experience much better. Everyone was friendly and helpful, and although they brought us our fries very late (we were already done with our sandwiches), they apologized for the wait and let us have free cookies. The place itself has a nice atmosphere and I liked that we could order from the counter rather than waiting for someone to come take an order."}
{"text":"I must say, my dining experience left me a tad bit disappointed. I live in Southern California and have several friends that have had relatively, pleasant, sanguine dining experiences here. I've long since seen photographs of SkinnyFATS' entrees on Instagram and was intrigued enough to visit their website to get a better feel of what this place had to offer. The contradiction in the restaurant name, I found amusing, inviting. It sparked curiosity inside of me so great, across the state line I went, hungry to delve into the enigma that is \"SkinnyFats.\"   I really wanted to like to this place.  I ordered two items, one from the \"happy side\" and one from the \"healthy side.\" I had both their \"Happymess Fries\" as well as their \"Skinny Q.\" My order came to over twenty-one dollars with no beverage.   The Happy Mess Fries, I found to be particularly pitiful. The menu claimed them to be truffle fries, an item, I'm not exactly sure they are knowledgeable in its essence. The shoestring fries were topped with New York Strip streak, pico de gallo, and bleu cheese. I suppose the food delivered, as what I received were bland fries, chunks of tomato, onions, cilantro, large chunks of salty blue cheese, and a single sliced canned jalepeno at the bottom of the *hapless mess.  What the fries were missing were a sauce--something to tie it all together, as opposed to being ingredients simply mountained on top of one another. They have ketchup and Cholua conveniently situated on the table, none of which did anything to remedy the hapless situation. Give me something creamy; give me a house made sauce with my fries. (2/5 Stars)  The Chicken Flatbread was alright. There was nothing memorable about my meal. I look back and think, \"Meh, I've experienced better\", although I found it to be \"A-Ok\", which is why I am giving this dish three stars (3/5). As for tips to improve the flatbread, I'd first recommend, seasoning the chicken. Again, season the chicken. If you didn't catch it the first time, season the damn chicken. Also, it'd be nice if you shredded chicken on my flatbread, so I don't have to take mouthloads of your bland chicken to the back of my pharynx all at once. At least give diners the opportunity of masking the bland chicken with the agave barbecue and ranch you've got below. (I'm on your side here). Also, portion size; on my flatbread was perhaps a single ounce of poultry. I have no problem getting dressed in the dark to put food into my stomach, but priced at $9.50, I felt robbed. \"Where exactly did the ten dollars that I payed go towards?\", I sat bemused in thought upon receiving my meal.  (Don't worry, below I have attached photographs to document my accusations.)   Overall, a poor dining experience and last taste of Vegas. Great concept; however, poorly executed. It is simple, rudimentary food they are attempting--chicken & waffles, loaded fries, flatbreads; it is nothing revolutionary, and they are falling short on production. Don't allow your eyes to fall prey to deception; the food is mediocre at best.  Three (3/5) stars for SkinnyFATS."}
{"text":"One word can't describe the food here, everything is amazing!!! My favorite is the ahi tacos!!! Pretty fast service only down fall is not enough room for how many people are trying to sit down"}
{"text":"Amazing! All the workers here are so friendly and so chill. I just ordered Garden Treat and it's to-die-for. Check out this cute little hipster place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but the taste of the food just made it difficult. We had the ahi tacos and the filet mignon teriyaki bowl. While the food wasn't bad, it just seemed like something you could make at home without trying. We also had a cold pressed smoothie which was really good. I would give the smoothie five stars. The staff was also friendly."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot about this place and finally came to try it. I had no idea its right down the street from me! The concept is neat.. Half the menu is healthy, the other half not.. It would have been interesting if they posted the calorie count as well, but they didn't.. I also had to resort to their online menu for pictures. The food looks amazing.. Wish they had pictures in the restaurant.   **something to think about, owners!**  Off the \"Happy Menu\" (unhealthy): We ordered the **CHEEZY PEEZY** which was extremely simple.. Flatbread with cheese and pepperoni.. But I liked it a lot.. Totally hit the spot.. It was my favorite item today actually..   We also got the **S'MOTHERLOAD** which is basically a really tasty steak breakfast burrito. The sauce that came on it was a tad spicy, and I loved it. The meat was juicy and tender and the eggs and potatoes were perfect.  Off the \"Healthy Menu\" we got the **AHI SRIRACHI**. Not because it was healthy, but I didn't like this too much. The flavors were lost on the sweetness of this item. There are diced mangoes in this taco and it completely masks the spicy.   Overall I'm really happy with this place! I'm already dying to come back to try the Chicken Waffle's among other items!  Be back soon!!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop into SkinnyFATS before our flight out of Vegas and we were NOT disappointed! The staff was SO friendly and helpful and made us feel welcomed. The atmosphere of the place is so cool and unique. The food was AMAZING! We were not expecting to get so much food for the great prices but we couldn't even finish what we got because it was so big. I've already told many people about SkinnyFATS because I think if you're visiting Vegas, THIS should be on your list of places to try!"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday and the food was really delicious. I got the buff chix which was a little spicier than I expected but still delicious! The truffle fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"As someone else had said, I regret not coming here sooner! I've had a hanger to partake from both happy and healthy sides, and they both have incredible options. As I am working to eat a little cleaner, I'll share from the healthy side. Cluck Moo is probably one of my favorite any-time-of-the-day meals. I surprised myself by enjoying the Naked Chix, chicken with mango over cauliflower rice. Everything was surprisingly flavor-packed, and the cauliflower rice was not nearly the bland, lifeless dish I assumed it would be!   As for environment, the place is stunning - the atmosphere and decor are a mix of modern, eclectic, thrift, and just COOL. The bathrooms were clean and have the coolest dual faucet/air dryer I've ever seen. They stay fairly busy but get the food out fast. If there's a line to order, it can be tough to see/read the overhead menu; they planned ahead and provided a ton of menu pamphlets throughout the ordering line, and have visual screens displaying some food options as well.  All in all a great visit with great atmosphere and delicious food. I'll gladly go back!"}
{"text":"What a delight to walk in and be treated with such respect and enthusiasm from an amazing employee Halle! She was very knowledgable about the menu and was able to help my whole family find exactly what they wanted!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place that we came here twice on our Vegas trip!! Definitely come a little earlier to beat the lines as this place definitely fills up fast (they have limited table seatings since the place is kind of small).  We ordered:  1) Wake n' Bacon: A Hawaiian roll with applewood bacon, egg frittata, pepper jack cheese, avocado, sriracha scallion cream cheese with country potatoes. Doesn't that just sound enticing? This was one of our favorites. The sauce is really addicting (5/5)  2) Spudghetti: You guessed it. Potato noodles!!! It comes with bacon, shredded cheddar, sour cream and green onions. We were excited to try it because it's quite creative. The potato noodles had great texture but the overall taste was a bit dull because it could have had more flavoring besides the sour cream and onions. We expected it to be more flavorful but it kind of tasted somewhat bland, but a good try though (4/5)  3) More Cow Bowl: If you like rice bowls, then definitely get this one. There's teriyaki filet mignon, portobello mushrooms, cauliflower, sliced bell peppers, green onions over egg fried rice. It's pretty filling and definitely shareable. The meat was kind of overcooked but overall, it was decent (4/5)  4) Chix On Broadway: A healthy take on your burger with breaded chicken breast, cheddar, onion, lemon herb aioli on a brioche bun with your choice of side. I chose truffle fries and they were pretty good. The chicken was definitely a bit burnt but it was a good one to try nonetheless. Let me just tell you that the burger is HUGE. I ate half and my bf finished the rest (5/5)  Verdict? Great food. Good prices. Your stomach and wallet will both love you."}
{"text":"This place is nice good choices in sauces great soda . Employees are very helpful when you have questions the food was really good too I will be going back just to try there breakfast food . Maybe to try some of there sides but the truffle fries are delicious"}
{"text":"Searching for this place was like a scene from Zero Dark Thirty, let the hint commence.  I pass by this place on the daily from the I-15, Terry, never managed to realize this place.  The sign wording is cool old school American farm style design, but too cluttered to make out from afar.  Once we finally arrived, I wasn't kidding when I added the tip about the clown car seating.  It is FCFS seating, so you can imagine, it can get pretty cut-throat, especially if you are really hungry.  I hoarded a cluster of tables and chairs from different ends of the dining area like a stingy toddler on the Amazing Race...mine mine MINE!!! (Hissing noise)  Truth be told, I was happy to learn that my supposed healthy/unhealthy meal was more on the unhealthy side, am I wrong for that?  We ordered the truffle fries, pollo fries, chef's special streak Benedict (2x) and drunken gypsy toast.  The wait was a bit lengthy and hadn't it been for the great Kentucky and Wichita State game during the madness, I may have had a more to say.  The inside is very well kept but the thermostat needed to simmer down a notch.  Don't very new wrong, I like it breezy, but I like my food sizzling even more...cold food robs meals of their flavor profiles.    Overall, the meal was good, the steak wasn't over cooked and the cornbread on the Benny was a good compliment.  The limited edition Heinz ketchup in jalapeno and vinegar flavor was a nice added touch as well.  Not bad and reasonably priced.  Just not sue if I would come unless it's xmas eve to avoid the crowd...3. 75 stars."}
{"text":"Word of advice: do not come here if you have more than 4 people in your group. This place can only handle about 25 people without it being a safety hazard.  I got the filet o fire  The fried came out super cold and seems like it was sitting out for quite some time with the air conditioning blowing down on it. They were nice enough to take it back but there was zero improvement. It remained cold and the sandwich wasn't any better.  The sandwich was ok. The meat was tender but it was scarce. That's about all I can say about the food.  The servers were nice and helpful. The star rating reflects the food."}
{"text":"This place is great. My bf and I always seem to get stuck between healthy and well, not so healthy. SkinnyFATS will give you both. The menu offers a few styles of food which is great. The staff is always super friendly and can tell you about all the items on the menu. Price is pretty normal for the area. The food seems to come out in a reasonable time so that's another plus. Only downside is that it's a small place so seating can be a pain. Still worth stopping by if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend wanted to make note of the amazing customer service Chasen an employee of this establishment has.  We were there last night (8/5/15) after a really terrible early dinner. We got 2 Ahi Siracha and sweet potato fries with truffle sauce/dressing & 2 drinks.   We patiently waited for an hour.  Wondering where the food was as others that came after us already ate and left.  We made mention to a passing waiter -- but it was Chasen that actually was the most professional. He introduced himself and made sure he checked on our meals. As well as keep checking back periodically to make sure we left with a smile.   Not only did he corrected the situation. Simpathized with our situation. And went above and beyond expectations. And took it upon himself to represent the company in the most positive light.  Simply saying \"we don't roll like that.\" Implying that SkinnyFats is an establishment that does care or doesn't want anyone to feel less important as a customer.   To find this is already few and far inbetween for places in Las Vegas. This place and it's employees  (Notably Chasen) -- make a place worth going to time and time again.  And the amazing food is a plus!!  I hope that management will see and recogize this individual.  Hospitality + customer service + speaking to you like a fellow human = EXCELLENCE   I hope this never changes about this place as I will always refer my friends and family here!!  I will attach Chasen's photo here shortly (on the left) with my BF to the right."}
{"text":"We wanted breakfast and we got it.  Saw the good reviews and noticed this was not a normal breakfast place at all.  We got there and there was a line already but not out the door yet .  I saw on yelp a picture of the steak and eggs and I had to get it.  The pic was of 2 biscuits with fried steak, gravy and 2 eggs. Wow.  I ordered it at the cashier and she said that this entree, they replaced the biscuits with jalapeño cornbread!   I had to try!   Man. Whoever's idea was to replace the biscuits with jalapeño cornbread give them a promotion!!  This was the tastiest meal I have ever had besides my wife's cooking.  The cornbread was spicy but not a spicy that overwhelms the flavors of the steak, gravy and egg.   It's just right. When we left, the line was out the door and a couple were already eyeballing our table to sit.  Beware, this place is not for the cluster-phobic.   This place is small, in an industrial area with only maybe 10 tables and a 12 foot window counter.  They definitely need a bigger place."}
{"text":"Living in the north part of Las Vegas has meant that we need to drive some distances to our favorite eateries, but 2017 is starting off right with the opening of SkinnyFATS' third location.  Located off of the 215 and Decatur near BestBuy, this is excellent news for us because we don't live too far away at all.  We've been fans since the first SF opened on Dean Martin and now we can become regulars here.    What's so great about SkinnyFATS?  The menu offers up the healthy side and the happy side, so depending on what your diet and stomach wants on any given day, you can find an item to satisfy you.  There are also vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options if you need those.  Plus, the staff is friendly and answer any questions you may have about the menu.  Located in an already busy shopping plaza (the Costco side), just head for Massage Envy and BestBuy and you'll find it.  I'm giving you directions this way so you don't drive around in circles.  The interior of the restaurant has the cool murals like the other locations, a communal table, booths, and tables, plus several flat-screens.  The menu here boasts items that the other locations don't have, too.  We had dinner here last night and the joint was jumping.  There was a line to the door for ordering, but I didn't really mind since they did just open and it gave us a chance to peruse the menu.  I went with the Healthy Side's T.A.T.S.:  turkey bacon, avocado, tomato, and spinach on 9 grain toast, skipping the spicy yo sauce because I'm a wimp.  This comes with a side and I decided to get happy with truffle fries:  balance!  It was a great little meal and I'd have this healthier version of a BLT again.  I tried the b/f's Spicy Latina soup side and it was spicy, but very tasty, so try this chicken soup with tortilla strips and pepper jack cheese if you're in the mood. For a first visit at a location that just opened its doors, we left with our Happy Meter reading at \"overjoyed.\"  See you soon, SkinnyFATS."}
{"text":"I met Suzy H. and her adorable son here for lunch so we could check out the Skinny Bowl, their acai bowl.  Amanda M. is a fan so we knew we had to come.  Located on Dean Martin Dr., I must admit that getting here would be out of the way for most customers, but the place was still busy for a Friday at 1:30pm.  It's not a very big space, but there's a cool bar area with outlets for those who want to plug in and nosh, plus maybe 8 tables for others to sit.  The menu features a happy side and a healthy side, so customers have a choice of being bad or good, skinny or fat.  Suzy and I both had the acai bowls and her son had an order of Mr. Flapjack, protein pancakes with bananas and syrup atop the order--note that you could easily feed two people with that regular order.  The Skinny Bowl had acai, strawberries, granola, raisins, cranberries, bananas, and chopped almonds.  I know it's personal preference, but I found it to be okay in my book.  I like acai bowls with coconut, blueberries, and a touch of honey, items missing in this version.  I'm also not a fan of raisins in my food at all and the granola was more like granola cereal, packed not loose.  I ended up leaving all of the raisins and cranberries in the bowl, along with some of the granola.  Overall, though, I will definitely return to try some of the other items on the menu that look great.  Plus, I knew from perusing the Yelp pictures beforehand that they have a birthday freebie:  I got a Coke float with strawberries on the house and it definitely made my day.  The people there are friendly and I like the casual, cool vibe of the place.  Thanks, Skinnyfats--we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I definitely love the concept of this place.  One side of the menu is health food and the other side is junk food.  The menu is pretty big with lots of options...So depending on how you are feeling you can pick your poison.  The food is excellent, I had a Texas Coast Burger, and a steak here before.  I also had a fountain drink and they are awesome.  Its not Pepsi products or coke... they use a different off brand.  I like the ginger ale and the root beer ;) The ambience is chill, the employees were very nice and very cute... Football was on and I asked if they could change the channel and they did no problem.  The inside is a little small but there is a outside area as well on the side.    This place is great I would definitely try it out."}
{"text":"My experience at SkinnyFats was so good.  The service was awesome, the food was delicious, the atmosphere was inviting and the location kind of random (Dean Martin??  We almost missed the turn.)  I heard a lot about it prior to coming but I was a little worried about their selection because I was eating with vegetarians and a vegan.  We ate mostly from the \"healthy\" side, but we were not disappointed.  There were lot of options all which were delicious!    I loved the truffle fries with their specialty jalapeño Heinz ketchup!  The Beets by Goat salad was amazing!  I love arugula with goat cheese!  We also got the ahi tacos, smoke in a bowl, and the Aphrodite wedge ( which  looks a little different than a traditional wedge, but still good).     I really likes their \"healthy\"menu, but I can't wait to come back and get something on the \"happy\" side,"}
{"text":"Good food. Very filling. I got the mean bean burger and my daughter got the wake n bacon. We could only eat half. She got the skinny fats punch which is fruity and good. I got the hangover remedy. It was very heavy on the ginger or I'm sensitive to ginger because that's all I could taste. Next time I would request no ginger or very little. I put ice in it to weaken it up a bit. Nice environment and staff."}
{"text":"This place is so good and the staff were very nice!! The line and size of the place is a bit offputting but totally worth it! Great fresh food not far from the strip I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Yum! Hailing from San Diego and clearly unaware of the hip foodie scene in Vegas, I was dumbfounded when i stepped into SkinnyFATS.   The interior is very unique with paintings all over the walls with quirky quotes and the whole place just had a very urban industrial-esque feel to it. Upon one glance at the menu, i could not hold my giggles in because all of the items have very funny and puntastic names.  I finally decided on the \"cherry popper\" and my friend had the \"#America\". They were botj delicious! The cherry popper was a burger on a hawaiian bun with hot and sweet peppers and a bunch of other things i cannot remember anymore. But i just remember it being so good, especially with the truffle fries on the side. Delicious!  But the star of SkinnyFATS has to be their soda bar. You will NOT find your typical sprite, coca cola, neste raspberry iced tea here. They have a soda bar full of old fashioned root beer, cola, orange soda, ginger beer, etc. My favorite was the cream soda! I filled my cup 3 times and my tummy was so full from soda that my friend ate half my burger! (The re-usable cups are a cute and environmentally friendly touch as well!)  All in all, this place was a really great experience all around and I cannot wait to try other quirky items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Tasteless fries, dry as sawdust veggie burger, overly watery mushroom burger without flavor - if you eat meat I'm sure it's great - but for a live healthy motto this place is extremely limited and completely flavorless."}
{"text":"The clientele at this location are extremely rude. The atmosphere here because of it is not inviting.. At all.   The employees here are great though! My food was very good, as I expect from Skinnyfats. It did take a while for my smoothie to be made though.   Also, why do they have to name their soup \"spicy Latina\" geez. What if I were to call a bread on a sandwich \"basic white\"?"}
{"text":"I love the shakes here! They are to die for along with their fries. If i lived in Vegas i would go there every chance i got. But I still stop by when i'm in town. A little expensive, but what food is not when you are eating healthy? Still worth it!"}
{"text":"Wish they had one of these in Cali, I'd be there all the time. My husband and I visited this place today for lunch. Very glad we did. We ordered the Zucc It and the Berry Yum. The Zucc it was so flavorful and filling and the texture of the Berry Yum French toast was soft and chewy. The flavors of the orange agave and blueberry shined through. The one thing would have preferred is for it to have been less sweet. The best thing about the meal was that it was less than 500 calories for both! Guilt-free, reasonably priced, bomb food, what could be better? The staff here are also welcoming, friendly, and knowledgeable about the dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Yum! Very unique menu but everything we ordered worked so well, we loved it here. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"The service & food was seriously awesome!!!! We orded online and when we arrived our order was ready to go at the time I asked it to be. The food was simply delicious!!! :) All I can say is fantastic, fantastic, fanstic!!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this place. I loved it. Had the Cherry Popper burger (has egg) with truffle fries. We also ordered the Filet O Fire burger. Both burgers were very good and we will be back when we are in the area. We had great service especially when a large group showed up 15 minutes before closing."}
{"text":"Great place to go for breakfast and lunch; I've never tried anything that I didn't like. Today I had the Nice To Greek You, which is a flatbread dish with tzatziki, olives, red onions, feta, tomatoes, cucumbers, balsamic, and chicken. It was very good, I love the savoriness from the chicken mixed with refreshing flavors from the tzatziki and cucumbers. I've also tried a few of their savory and sweet breakfasts which were all very delicious. A must try restaurant if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Really cool restaurant. This chain restaurant is unique because it has two different menus to order from. The \"healthy\" side is for people tying to watch their weight and the \"happy\" side is for more flavorful, higher calorie foods. The decor here is really nice. There is a nice outdoor seating area perfect for anytime except summer, and the inside sitting area is very trendy. My personal opinion, I like this restaurant but I'm not blown away by it. Everything I had on the healthy side is mediocre at best (I was a vegan for 2 months and came here often because I work close by). In their defense, healthy food doesn't always taste the best. The happy side of the menu does taste good but I feel is too pricey for what it is. I enjoy the water dispenser because they add cucumber slices in the water which adds a refreshing taste to it. I'll probably come here occasionally because I work close by. I enjoy this place, the service is really good and the atmosphere is fun, but I can't see myself eating here more than once every other month."}
{"text":"After the tournament we all came to SkinnyFATS! My mom, sister and two family friends ate here before I got into town and thought that I would really enjoy it, so they took one for the team and ate here again.  They have two sides to the menu. The Skinny side is rather healthy and the other side, it more indulgent? is that the right word?.....yea, well go with indulgent.  The young lady, I don't know the spelling of her name so I won't even attempt to spell it out but she was working sunday night and she has black hair (ethnic) and black frames.  She is everything you would want customer service to be. The food was great but her service is what made me leave 5 stars.   We were a group of 7 and questions up the ass. More so from my mom and I. She can't eat anything spicy! and as for me, well, my questions go something like this:  Is the bun vegan? How is this made? Is there cheese mixed in? Is there any animal stock/broth in it? Does the sauce have any dairy?  She did not bat an eye, roll them into another universe, huff, sigh, or ANYTHING! She answered EVERY SINGLE QUESTION without hesitation!  I ordered the Mean Bean Vegan Burger and it was a hearty burger. Typically vegan burgers are thinner and not as filling but this burger is where it's at. They also give you a nice serving of sweet potato fries.  Also, I split the ZUCC IT dish with my sister. There were a lot of zuchinni noodles and veggies and the arribiata (italian for angry) is a spicy sauce. It all worked!  The food was good, the service from not only the young lady taking our order but everyone else is amazing. I LOVE awesome service!"}
{"text":"Great menu with a ton of both healthy and more savory options depending on your mood, great/friendly staff."}
{"text":"Where to start. The flavors, the choices, the staff. All five star. Who ever comes up with the ideas to pair the flavors and textures is amazing. We have tried both the happy and healthy side and have yet to have something I was not happy with. The place is super clean. The staff is always friendly and very helpful in explaining the menu. Don't forget to check out the specials and the secret menu. As far as food you can't go wrong so try anything or like us EVERYTHING. My personal fav would have to be smokies flat pizza a party in my mouth. Only thing I would red flag anyone about is Sunday morning is CRAZY don't let that scare you away. Everything moves quick and like a well oiled machine. My new obsession is Skinny Fats."}
{"text":"I wasn't to sure of the place at first.  I'm glad I stepped out of my comfort zone. This is surely one great place to eat!! Everyone is super nice and the food was fantastic!!! Must try!!!!!   The place was packed so we had to eat outside at 105 degrees in June but not biggie."}
{"text":"Oh if you have never been to skinnyfats your missing out on some good food.   I can't believe I've never done a review until now.   So you have the choice between something healthy or something fattening.  Everything I have had here has been amazingly good.   The service is always awesome and everyone is so friendly.  Quality of food is always fresh and tasty.  The facility is always clean and the decor is stylish and up to date.  The outdoor seating is comfy and shaded.  A total must!!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced. What more do you want? This place gets packed for lunch but the wait time after ordering is minimal. Ive waited longer at fast food joints and here you can get a meal worth eating."}
{"text":"Eh, just okay. I ordered the brioche French toast. It seemed pretty greasy, like maybe they use a lot of butter when cooking it. I didn't feel like there was a ton of flavor, it just seemed heavy. My friend ordered some wrap with steak and cheese sauce that was surprisingly delicious(and I don't like steak). The steak was very thin and tender. My son ordered the Mickey Mouse berry pancake, nothing special and hardly the shape of Mickey Mouse. Being a huge breakfast fan I am always searching for a good place to eat, that being said I won't return here. The staff was friendly but the food just didn't seem worth it for the price. I would rather go to stacks and yolks across the street or hash house a go go (my personal favorite) off Sahara."}
{"text":"Finally went to Skinny Fats!! We heard about it from the Unlokt app and we were very eager to go...and hungry. We enjoyed it very much. I had the Smoke in a bowl and it was simply delicious. Huge portion and very spicy and sweet. My sister had the Flat Chix and greens and she devoured it. The staff was very helpful and friendly and the place was pleasantly clean. I'm looking forward to going again for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The hype is true. SkinnyFats is delicious, affordable, and way cute. It is quietly snuggled on Dean Martin drive where business buildings and a strip club are located. It's Vegas, don't be so surprised.   The space is quaint and small with limited tables and just a handful of barstools. I have been fortunate enough to always beat the lunch rush. Their walls are hand painted with  pictures of vegetables from what I could remember.   I love their acai bowl aka SkinnyBowl and recently ventured to their Happy Side and ordered the \"happyness\". It is sliced pieces of steak with truffle fries. SO GOOD.   If you haven't tried it out, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Came back and finally tried something off of the \"fat\" side. I got the bomb diggity \"protein style\" Aka no bun   And it was   The bomb diggity!"}
{"text":"Best service and best food ever.  Healthy at its best. One and only healthy place in Vegas. Ate here twice and both times the food was incredible.  Great portions.  Bottled water prices are$2.50 whuch is good for vegas. Love the location and I love the customer service. Staff here is friendly and they are knowedable of the food.  Great options, turkey bacon and egg whites and red velvet waffles."}
{"text":"Sooooo good and healthy. Try their home made sauces... I wish there's SkinnyFATS in the Los Angeles area"}
{"text":"There's two things I love - Cobb salads and ahi. You don't understand, I legit love them. A place that serves both? Yay!  I went here with Michael P. & Jessica R. for dinner last night and ordered the Cobb me maybe & an ahi sirachi taco.   Michael ordered the neato burrito & Jessica ordered the Chix on Broadway + truffle fries.  After picking off the black beans, I dug into my salad. If I get it again, I'm going for the happy side Cobb because I wasn't feeling the dressing. On the plus side, there were a ton of toppings and it was a good value.  I have a thing about tortillas - I don't like flour tortillas unless they're cooked until crisp like a quesadilla or chimichanga. I think flour tortillas have a gummy, floury taste that I just can't stand. Unfortunately, the tacos here are served on flour rather than corn. Personal preference, but this would have been a killer taco on corn, but the tortilla was overpowering that it really masked all the flavors of the tacos.  Jessica and Michael split their meals with each other and they said the burrito looked great but was chewy and disappointing. Apparently the meat needed chopped up some to be manageable. The Chix sandwich looked incredible and apparently it was great. I tried some of the fries and found them to be... Dry? Can a fry be dry? I wish I would have tried the ketchups.   Anyway, I'll probably be back but I'll try something else. Last night was my \"last meal\" before I began my 14 day water fast so... We'll see about a repeat visit when I'm able to go out and eat again."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is a fun little joint hidden behind the madness of The Strip. The location is tucked away in a warehouse center, and the closest place of interest is the Hustler House, if that's your type of thing. I was really confused why this restaurant found its way here. I think it could do even better in a hotel or maybe closer to UNLV or possibly in Town Square.  The restaurant is much too tiny. My cousin and I came here on a Sunday afternoon, and even though we were able to find a seat rather quickly, everything felt so cramped. We came here with a baby car seat, and I do not recommend that. This place is best visited in pairs. You will not enjoy dealing with big groups here.  Now for the food. Surprisingly, there aren't really any desserts. But oh my goodness. I still loved my food! The portions are very generous for the prices. I had the Drunken Gypsy Toast and the Ahi Taco-San. Yum!  I wasn't expecting the toast to taste that sweet! It was delicious! I probably could have used more whipped cream, but it was still a lovely dish. Aesthetically, it looked gorgeous. All of the fruits were fresh and sweet. My bacon was good, too!  The Ahi Taco-San was excellent. The tuna was cooked to perfection and all of the stuff that topped the taco was scrumptious and paired well with the tuna. There were jalapeños in it, which I'm not a fan of, but I totally didn't mind them in this taco. Everything about this taco was to die for, haha. And it was so decently priced!  Overall, my experience at SkinnyFats was a good one, I only had a few details to pick at. I certainly recommend this place to anyone looking for fun,  filling food. You'll have a blast here."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats, I love you and your unique menu items. The food here is amazing, I don't think you can go wrong with any selection. I like the secret menu available on their app. I would suggest downloading that. I also really like their lemonade and free lemon cucumber water. And let's not forget about feeling skinny or fat. Yum.   SkinnyFats, definitely one of my favorite spots. Always a treat here."}
{"text":"Love their ahi sriracha tacos! Very flavorful and filling, they give you huge portions so come hungry! Also tried the chicken and waffles which I thought were just ok. The waffle was pretty dry and kinda hard. The Chicken was juicy, but a little on the salty side. Def will come back to try their breakfast offerings!"}
{"text":"Oh man... so good.  I ended up eating my food and some of my lady's because it was so tasty. The best part of the meal was that neither of us got that \"yuck\" feeling after we were done and heading home. I do have to say my only disappointment was the truffle fries.. but the rest of it was so good, I wouldn't even think to take a star off.  It's a little hard to find, we passed it twice.. but it is worth the hunt."}
{"text":"The buff chix was great  the smoke in a bowl was horrible, the cashier girl was not friendly at all,  the waitress not friendly either."}
{"text":"I ordered the red velvet waffle and Ice Mocha coffee.  My husband ordered the 3 healthy chicks and Ice Latte. Just ok"}
{"text":"Off the strip, definitely recommend driving or taking an Uber -- The taxi ride from our hotel was $20.  Very small place, had to wait for a table. Order at the counter and find a seat kind of restaurant.  Food was pretty good. I advise looking at the pics on Yelp to decide what you want, because the descriptions of some of the dishes were a bit deceiving. Service was excellent, and didn't need to wait too long for the meals to come out.  Worth checking out if it's convenient to do so, but I personally don't think it's worth going out of your way for it."}
{"text":"This place is very unique and innovative with the menu. They've manage to really put together some fresh, quality meals that really enlightens the taste buds.   The service is great, the atmosphere is cool, and the food is positively delicious! I ventured to this hidden gem twice during my visit and was very pleased. I would definitely recommend looking at the pictures on Yelp! To help you decide which dish to try"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast. The restaurant located in the middle of nowhere, it was kind of hard to find but after 10 mins driving around we finally did it and we were so surprised that the place very busy and stylish, remind me LA style hipster cafes. Everything fresh, green and tasty. Ordered veggie burger it comes with a sweet potato fries soooo delicious. 5 stars. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Have heard from friends about it but I'm not into cool and trendy places typically but this place does great! Great atmosphere and enjoyable decor! Food was awesome and would totally go back! I have been craving the ahi healthy side taco!!! I wish they could mail them to me as I live out of state."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence.....  I had brunch here on Sunday morning with a friend.  I arrived just after 10am, when they opened and it wasn't crowded (yet).  I was able to get a table for the 2 of us immediately and my friend arrived shortly after.  Lucky for us, because within 20 minutes or so, it was PACKED and there wasn't a seat to be found - even at the \"bar.\"  This is an interesting concept.  As you likely already know - there are 2 sides of the menu - the \"Skinny\" or healthy side and the \"Fat\" or happy side.  I don't think the happy side has that bad of stuff on it, everything still seems somewhat healthy.  You order at the counter, which can cause a long line and back up.  When we tried to leave, it was hard to get out because there were so many people in line waiting to place an order.  Anyhow, there was also a guy taking beverage orders to keep those in line happy, which was very nice.  The cashier was friendly and helpful and offered recommendations.  My friend ordered a Juan Healthy Wrap from the healthy side (because she planned on ordering the Sunday Sundae as well) and I ordered the Drunken Gypsy Toast from the happy side. My food was creme bruleed french toast with berries, bananas, whipped cream and syrup served with apple smoked bacon ($7.75).  It was pretty darn delicious!  I also had a strawberry lemonade, which was only OK.  It tasted really watered down.  We then shared the Sunday Sundae, which was a Fruit Loops doughnut from Pink Box, on top of puff pastry with vanilla pudding and ice cream, fruit salad and whipped cream.  Boy was it sweet!  Way too sweet for me, but the few bites I had were tasty.  The reason I am on the fence - I really wanted to try one of their cold pressed juices, but I couldn't justify paying almost $10 for it.  That just seems crazy to me.  I can get a Bountiful Basket for $15 and that would make a heck of a lot more juice than the 24 ounce glass they serve for just less than that.  And people wonder why so many folks choose to eat at McDonald's on the Dollar Menu?!  I also dislike how tiny this place is.  It's uncomfortable to be eating with people lurking over your shoulder, waiting to take your seat.  It makes it hard to enjoy your meal when you feel like you have to eat quickly.  Also, it's the strangest location.  Not hard to find, but not necessarily convenient to anything either.  Anyhow, brunch was overall pretty good.  I am not sure I would go out of my way to dine there, but it was a nice morning."}
{"text":"Place is awesome as there is something for everyone. Menu is friendly as you can choose from the be healthy side or the be happy side. Food is great and im coming back again and again"}
{"text":"I've eaten at the other location but the menu was different. Probably because I came in earlier in the day. I tried a breakfast item and it was ok. The location was convenient to where I was but absolutely not a first pick. The chair I sat in was super not comfortable. The other location had like a bench that was good. It was just ok/I think the other location is better. But I don't think I'd go back to either-too many other great choices out there."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats was good. The burger I ate in phases since I don't eat that much. It was actually good cold which means it's a pretty decent burger. Next time I'll ask for crispy bacon. The truffle fries were not good to me. But I'm a French fry freak so they had a really really high standard to live up to compared to others I've had in town. Also had fried pickles and they were ok but didn't care for the dipping sauce. I would give them another try after trying a few more spots in town first because the burger was pretty doggone good cold."}
{"text":"I love the outdoor patio! I had the Tu-nuts and my partner had a burrito. Both were really good! Everything else on the menu sounds really good too so I'm looking forward to trying everything else here!"}
{"text":"Love this place . The idea of healthy and fatting food is a great combo. Always make this a stop when I come in town."}
{"text":"My go to when I can't think of what to eat! Everything is so good!!!! Can never decide if I want to be skinny or fat though? Lol"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today with recommendation from another yelp user. It wasn't the easiest place to find since their sign is flat and does not stand out. Walking in, there was quite a line (which I'm told is normal), the menus were on the wall near the door for convenience while waiting, and there was cold water to help yourself to. The menu is clever and has unique items, but is a little hard to follow fluently. The prices for entrées varied from about $7-$13 roughly. They also had side items and other goodies for less.   To say the building is small is an understatement. It was cramped and crowded waiting in line, and in the \"larger\" part of the restaurant. You pay for your food and find a table where they bring the order, or you can order to go. We opted to eat there since we had somewhere to be afterward. I saw a table open up (it's first come first serve for seating since it's tiny) so I didn't get to see how the service was at the register.   I ordered a cheeseburger benedict with no onions and a strawberry lemonade. I was feeling adventurous and fat, so I had to do it. My husband got the more cow bowl with no onions and a strawberry lemonade as well. When we took a drink of the lemonade it was awful. It was almost lukewarm and was watered down. When the server came to drop the food off at the table, we let him know. He sincerely apologized and exchanged both for rootbeer.  The food came and I was impressed with the presentation of it for sure. The burger was big and had cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo, avocado, and of course the egg with their sauce on it. The burger was cooked just above medium - well (which I love) and the ingredients were fresh. To my horror the burger still had pieces of red onion throughout. I wasn't sure if it was in the meat itself or just random pieces overlooked. The fries were amazing. My husband's food also had onions (we think onions came from Satan), so I was disappointed to see that. However his bowl was delicious as well (of course I had a bite! It had fried rice AND steak!).   Regardless of the hiccups, I feel the ambience of the restaurant is pretty cool. Due to its compact size, I was happy to get out of there after eating. We were practically tackled for our table when we got up to go. The food, the menu, and service were all fab so I would recommend this place, and hope to be back soon. Maybe next time I'll order online and pickup though. Hopefully they open another location in Henderson and it will be bigger :)"}
{"text":"Every meal I've had at skinny fats has been wonderful. I love taking people here, especially picky eaters. Or more health conscious friends. They order something amazing off the healthy side, and I happily enjoy the sweet cheesus and truffle fries.   Though I've also had many of the healthy options, and they're also incredible. The steakation is fabulous.   The cookies are great, but seem a bit pricey."}
{"text":"The crazy thing about reviews, is that everyone has a different experience.   My experience of this restaurant was total meh. Party of 3 came in for lunch around 130pm. I had already Yelped it (obviously) and was reallly excited to try it. My gf even drooled on my arm while looking at the pics #truestory.   We started with the 'hot mess' appetizer which is nachos with buffalo chicken, cheese, jalapeños and sour cream. It came out with the rest of our food. They were not hot, the cheese had kind of hardened from being cold-ish and there was no jalapeño ranch, like it said on the menu.   I ordered the 'hot chix' salad. I was underwhelmed and overwhelmed at the same time. I felt like there were too many flavors going on between the buffalo chicken which is actually spicy, the bleu cheese, the fried jalapeños and the buffalo ranch which tastes more like chipotle ranch. I love buffalo chicken and I didn't like this one.   My friends ordered the 'meltdown' which she said was really greasy and the 'sweet cheese us' which was pretty good and the hoagie roll was soft.   My salad came out before anything and so we all sat there waiting for the rest of the order. The 3 meals with app and 2 drinks was about 60. I probably wouldn't go back except the guy next to me ordered the chicken and waffles which he said is really good. I will say the presentation of the items was good, but I felt it missed the mark on flavor."}
{"text":"The juice is expensive $9 for 16 oz of juice The food is so-so. Why did they get 4.5 stars?"}
{"text":"Since I moved back to Vegas earlier this year, I've been making the rounds to find new restaurants and hidden gems, and Skinny Fats is by far the best I've found!    I've been back several times and have loved it every time.   They have put together a combination of awesome food, fun atmosphere and a staff that is incredibly cool and engaging that is tough to beat in Vegas.    One of my favorite things to do at a new restaurant is ask the server what they would get, and often I get a dumbfounded look and then just a bunch of questions about what I want.  When I ask the question at Skinny Fats, I get a passionate response full of insider tips.  The best thing I've had so far is the \"Smotherload Burrito\".  One of the best I've ever had.  And ENORMOUS!  The Chicken and Waffles chowder is also phenomenal.   You really can't go wrong with Skinny Fats, although I can't say with confidence that the \"Skinny\" side of the menu is any good.  I haven't ordered anything off that side yet... Don't tell my wife ;-)  It can be hard to find a table, so be prepared for that.  However, not being able to find a table is usually a good sign that you're in the right place!"}
{"text":"Wow! Exceptional service and incredible food! I will definitely be returning! The only thing I'm sad about is that it took me so long to try it out."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Skinny Fats after wanting to try it for quite a while. During my first trip I just ran over during my break and grabbed the Acai Bowl. I love my Acai Bowls and this one was pretty good, possibly the best I have had in Vegas although Daily Kitchens is also amazing not sure which one I like more.   During my second trip I picked up dinner for me and my girlfriend on the way over to her house. She got the boneless chicken wings they were a little spicy for her taste but I didn't mind it. The order says it comes with 3 or 5 I can't remember but they ended up giving a couple extra which made for nice leftovers the next day. I got the cheesesteak, I replaced the blue cheese with American I think. I'm a big cheesesteak fan, this one was a little untraditional but it was good. The steak inside was very tasty! I ordered truffle fries as my side dish and those were super good.   The only downside to Skinny Fats is that it's a really small place and every time I have been there it has been packed which results in a wait. Tried to go one morning for breakfast (I really want to try the breakfast, I've seen the dishes people are eating when I've been there and it looks amazing!) but turned around cause the line was too ridiculous. If you are planning a trip to Skinny Fats be prepared to wait.. But if you haven't been yet stick through the wait at least once and you'll probably be back for more."}
{"text":"WOW! completely exceeded my expectations. We got the caulifire, truffle fries, blaze sandwich, shrimp tacodilla, and 2 cookies. The atmosphere was modern and industrial. The staff were all so pleasant and personable. There was cucumber lemon infused water, and cane sugar soda, but the food was truly the star. Everything was superb.  I did spy a ice cream sundae on the ayyyyy out that sported a doughnut as a topping.... now on my bucket list."}
{"text":"The food the vibe the service are all amazing.  It is a small space so either expect to sit at a small table, the counter or get your food to go...but everything is really good."}
{"text":"Skinny Fats is amazing...this is their 2nd location and I couldn't be more thrilled because it is closer to my house..  The food is amazing...staff is well trained and very much into serving their customers...  Love it!"}
{"text":"What else do you say about this place except, go back as often as you can! Love everything about it.   Food A+ Service A+ Decor A+ Ambiance A+  Also love the little touches..  Even their complimentary water is flavored with fruit or cucumber .  The only thing that I would change is the menue itself is a little confusing to read for the first timer. I think they should test different layouts and see if it affects sales. If you don't know better at first you think there's just breakfast, then you're like oh there's more.. and the salads get lost on the back. - just my two cents.  Love it, will return, thanks for making such a yummy place!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is a unique restaurant in Las Vegas that features two sides to its menu.  A Skinny, healthy side and an indulgent, fat side.  You'll find a large, unique menu that ranges will cover just about any dietary need or want.  Fresh, healthy salads share the spotlight will fantastic burgers and fries.  It's one of the best concepts I've ever experienced.   My Overall Rating - 5 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)  Atmosphere - The only negative to SkinnyFATS is that it's not a big restaurant.  But it's one built for the 21st century.  Inside you'll find wooden walls decorated with custom art.  There's also a long counter with bar stool seating with electric outlets with USB ports.  On a Thursday evening visit the light was dim, the music chill, and I felt like I was at a hip lounge.  1 Star.  Service - Upon entering you'll line up next to the main bar/counter and wait to place your order.  The staff will set you up with a nice, cold drink with a nice selection or beers while you're waiting to place your order.  Once you do, you'll get a number, find a seat, then wait for them to bring it out.  One side note, our party of 7 called in to let them know we were coming & they setup a group of tables for us before we got there.  1 Star.   Food - Ever been to a restaurant where you don't know what to order because everything sounds so great?   Well SkinnyFATS fits the bill.  But I'll be honest, I didn't bother with the skinny/healthy side, instead I focused on the burgers.  Just about everyone in our party ordered one.  I went with the patty melt.  It was delicious with a buttered, griddled sourdough sandwich with perfectly melted cheese and juicy patty.  The parmesan truffle fries were a great side to pair with it.  The meal was fantastic and I think I went through a huge stack of napkins on my way to devouring it all.  They even serve breakfast dishes all day.  I didn't quite get to that part of the menu, but it's good to know for the future.  2 Stars.  Will I Return? - Yes.  Honestly I feel like I need to come back in another big party and just agree to share all our dishes.  Breakfast, burgers, healthy, happy, SkinnyFATS has a great menu and I'm sold.  Without a doubt my next visit to Vegas will include a trip back.  1 Star.  My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts): 1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm. 1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point. 2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food. 1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return.   Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score."}
{"text":"Wanted to come here for sometime.  First of the ordering system was a long wait.  There was only 1 cashier, but she was quick and friendly so no fault of hers.  We ordered the Meltdown burger and the Classic burger.  The bread was fine on the Meltdown but had so much butter on it.  The burgers themselves had no flavor at all. The breakfast potatoes had no flavor and some were way undercooked. Sweet potatoes were ok. The cola tasted strange...may be not used to it with cane sugar.  Sorry but underwhelmed on the whole meal."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! It's a little off the grid as far as location but totally worth it ! I've had their Greek flatbread and the steak & berry flatbread. Both were delicious ! It is a little small and gets pretty busy around lunch time - just get there a little early."}
{"text":"I do love my SkinnyFATS even though I've had minor issues with them almost every time I've ordered online (although usually another location) from missing sauce, wrong sauce, missing items, food not ready, not finding my store credit, etc.  I don't live in LV, but travel here constantly. That said, to say I was SHOCKED by the whole \"downtown Summerlin\" thing is an understatement. It's what every suburb dreams of becoming. Rows of Teslas, Mercedes, Porches, nice even sidewalks, well lit, stores galore, movie theater, parallel parking to try your hand at (I'm a pro), and a parking garage to keep your huge truck or SUV out of the \"rain\". Luckily, SkinnyFATS has 2 to-go parking spots outside so you don't have to trek from the garage.  This location was way busier than the others I've used. Normally I just wait in the line to pickup, but this location had a guy ask me right when I walked in if I was picking up and guided me to not wait in the line. Go straight to the bar area if you're just picking up. He was great, food was ready. My only complaint this time is that my \"over easy egg\" was completely solid, 100% solid. As usual, I'll be back, but next time putting \"ridiculously runny egg\" instead of over easy."}
{"text":"Going with 3.5, because the food is still good, but the rest was annoying.   --only 2 people running the whole front, including register, at dinner time on a Friday --order placed at 6:30 for 7 pickup. I arrived at 7:05 and it wasn't ready. The one salad wasn't ready. --there were 3 sauces in the order but it came out with none. Back in I went. --they were quite confused about the sauces including asking the kitchen for \"Aaaa-gave\" bbq. No wonder the kitchen was confused. Guy obviously wasn't familiar with \"agave\" or how to pronounce. --I ended up with ketchup, buffalo sauce and a Chipotle something. A bit different from the ranch, bbq, and aioli I had ordered, but by then I just wanted to leave. It was 7:30.  My ooo-ahhh experience from previous is tainted. But I'll be back.  Update: they contacted me immediately after this review to remedy the situation. Awesome.  Although, I went to use the credit they gave me for this bad experience and (of course) the guys working there could not find any credit. After I held up the line for 20 min, I ended up just paying."}
{"text":"Such a cute and cool cafe. Walk up to order. They have rice bowls, appetizers, yummy sammiches, and salads. Their fruit drinks and cookies look good too. I ordered the patty melt with truffle fries, veggie bowl, chicken mango and jasmine rice, and a buffalo chicken salad. All were very good quality and quantity. A guy came out and chatted with my mom, me, and my daughter asking if we were waiting for our order. What a sweet, generous gesture- offered us a free cookie while we waited. He has a soft spot for baby girls cuz he has one himself. Great, personable customer service! Thank you for the lemon blueberry cookie!"}
{"text":"A place to try for a casual date and want great breakfast. What I recommend here is the red velvet waffle with bacon and the chicken and waffles they are... how should I say AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah mind boggling good. Definitely go here if you're in Vegas!  Hidden gem and definitely a cant miss place. Breakfast choices are great and also a bunch of healthy stuff on the menu. Will go again when back in Vegas."}
{"text":"*Military discount*  . Went on Friday 2-5-16 around 6:30 PM.  This restaurant is located on Dean Martin between Sunset and Russell Road.  It's much smaller inside than the one on Warm Springs and the vibe is more dark and hipster-ish.  $35.28 got us a side of fruit, a warm cookie, a tu-nuts apperizer, a chickhumm sammich, and a buff chix bowl.  . $9.95 Tu-nuts appetizer is a cucumber half that they remove the seeds from and then put raw ahi tuna chunks, sriracha slaw, almonds, teriyaki sauce, avocado, and a sriracha aoli on top.  I do not like raw fishes for the most part but my hubs said it was very tasty.  I tried a bite and almost gagged but like I said....I don't like raw fishes!!!  .  $9.95 Chickhumm sandwich- had grilled chicken, sprouts, tomatoes, red onions, and hummus on a multigrain bun.  Husband chose brown rice as his side.  I heard no complaints from him and I like that they have sprouts because I don't see those a lot here in Las Vegas.   .  $7.95 buff chix- fried buffalo chicken tenders and I swapped out the truffle fries for sweet potato fries.  Their ranch is awesome and the tenders were hot and juicy.  The fries go perfectly with their jalapeno ketchup.  .  $1.95 warm cookie was tasty but I definitely would rather have McDonald's version.  The $3.95 side of fruit was so tasty and perfectly ripe.  I love that my hubs can have his healthy crap from the \"healthy side\" and I can eat like a normal person from the \"happy side\".  Next time I want to try their breakfast and one of their not-so-secret menu items."}
{"text":"*military discount*   Short version:  Overhyped, espensive, not worth it.    Long version:   Went on Sunday 10-11-15 around 12:30 PM.  No line at all so we ordered right away at the counter. $26.84 got me a regular size Mr. Green juice, a \"Sweet Cheese Us\" sandwich, and the \"Brussel Crowe\". No high chair was offered for my kiddo so I held him in my lap.  Not sure if they have them or not.    After trying one of their yummy juices at the last yelp event I figured they were all that tasty so I ordered up a \"Mr. Green\" which is comprised of spinach, parsley, kale, romaine, celery, cucumber & apple.  At $9 it is definitely the most expensive non-alcoholic liquid I've ever had in my mouth. One sip had me re-thinking my decision and contemplating taking it back.  It was watery and terrible. I decided it was probably just my personal tastes and dumped my expensive-ass juice down the drain and refilled it with some Boylan ginger ale.  What a waste.   The \"Sweet Cheese Us\" was listed on the menu as shaved NY Strip, cherry/banana peppers, caramelized onions, portobello, pepper jack & cheddar sauce on a hoagie w/side.  I chose sweet potato fries as my side.  If this sandwich was on the healthy side I would have been impressed.  It was too big and sloppy to fit in my mouth so I ended up eating it with a fork.  Bland strips of steak and portobello topped with the most bizarre cheese sauce I've ever seen.  Somehow it managed to be grainy and runny at the same time.  While I appreciate the effort to be more natural than the neon yellow stuff from a can, I would definitely pass on this one next time.  Sweet potato fries were really good, though, and that jalapeno ketchup is nothing short of genius.    The \"Brussel Crowe\" was my most anticipated dish of the day.  I love brussel sprouts!! The menu described it as brussel sprouts w/marinara, basil, provolone & pepperoni.  Like brussel pizza! It would have been awesome if the sprouts weren't completely raw.  Trying to masticate them bad boys was tiring.  I don't know if that's how they're supposed to be or not but I definitely wouldn't order this again.    If I ever go back I'll definitely get breakfast.  From reading the other reviews they seem to be the tastier items."}
{"text":"Quick. Easy. FUN. SkinnyFATS is a great lunch spot when you need a break from shopping. I tend to stay on the healthy side of the menu and everything I have had has been delicious. I had the veggie burger the first time around which had a yummy black bean patty and sweet potato fries. I got the avocado toast for breakfast which was gourmet af and loaded with flavor.   I ordered the Naked Chix today and HOLY- it is amazing. I scarfed it down in 5 minutes. The mango chutney sauce on it is incredible. 10/10 would recommend.   I always get their cold pressed juices. The Hangover Cure is so far my favorite. You can't go wrong with the Skinny Punch either. It's like a healthy slurpee.   It's worth noting that the employees here are awesome. The menu can be daunting at first but they are always really knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to substitutes and helping you choose an option."}
{"text":"absolutely love this place!! everything is so tasty and i've never been disappointed with a meal. definitely appreciate the amazing customer service and friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were just talking how good this place is! Please plan to open up in the Bay Area, specifically in the Fremont area!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been meaning to try this place, and so glad we did today. Our meals were delicious and noticeably exceptional customer service. From start to finish, greeting when walking in, very polite when ordering, recommendations made, very attentive throughout our meal, and overall very welcoming up until we left. This was very impressive!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a fun place. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is relaxed. I can recommend the Hot Chix salad and the Spicy Latina soup. My husband loves the soda choices and the hamburgers.  It is not a 5 star experience but it is excellent modified fast food restaurant. I wish they had a location closer to Henderson but it is worth the trip to the closest location to you."}
{"text":"Omg, can I cry now? When we walked into this place, it had just a California vibe that we totally fell in love with. Once you walk in, you order at the front then seat yourself. They bring the food for you :)  We tried the Chix on Broadway with truffle fries, chikkawaffa.... haha I forgot how to spell it but it's the chicken strips and waffle, sweet potatoes fries and a few other things. Omg, I looooove!!! The chicken strips on the waffles were SO TENDER!!!!! Perfect amount of flavor. The waffles were delishhhhh! Got a side of gravy and man, I was dipping my fries in it like it was ketchup. Perfect combination. The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy. The truffle fries were so truffle-lyyy.. I could tear up because I was happy haha. The breaded chicken burger was amazing. I had it with the peppered ketchup they put out on the table along with the chipotle ketchup. What went well with it too was the syrup from the waffles and the gravy. Drool!! I'm so excited that they are making one downtown Summerlin. Much closer to me and I'll definitely be there every week!!!! This place is that good. I recommend it to anyone that love their healthy foods and feelin' a bit naughty with those fried goodness. Cheers!!!!"}
{"text":"A unique place. It's small, but has a interesting variety of tasty food. Forth trying it out."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so bad but it was only so so. The location is awesome and the design of the restaurant is awesome. Being that it was our first time I looked at the menu prior to going, so I had an idea what I wanted. That being said when you walk in you order at the counter, so you either have to look at the menu on the screens or on a paper menu. Ordering took a tad longer then I would have thought it would but  I got the children's chicken fingers and fries, children shakes, Balls 2.0, fried pickles, steakation (with sweet potato fries) and swinology (with regular fries). The kids enjoyed their chicken and fries and their shakes. The fried pickles were ok but they were served with some weird sauce that I found off putting. The Balls 2.0 were ok, the balls themselves had no flavor but the sauce they were served with helped a lot. I had the steakation and found it very, very dry. For the amount of bun there was I think it needed to have some sauce or something because it just felt dry. Even when I tried to just eat the inside of the sandwich without the meat everything was dry. My husband had the swinology and said it was ok and he could live without coming again. We like to drink water and so if you opt not to get a soda and want water be prepared to get up a couple times during your meal to do so, or grab more then one cup. They have white cups for water that are about the size of a kids cup."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They live up to all the hype. They have great healthy and not so healthy choice. I had the Steak Eyes 2.0 and they cooked everything perfectly. I can't say enough about how good it was."}
{"text":"I almost hate to write this, because I don't want it to get even busier; but I'm doing it anyway because this place is so awesome!  After seeing a Facebook friend continually post pics from Skinny Fats, I knew I had to try it.  I knew the restaurant was small, but decided to be brave, and not only took my family of four on a Friday night, but an additional family of four as well.  We arrived at 5:30; early enough to get a table configurated for the 8 of us and the waiter couldn't have been any nicer or accommodating about it.  It is very small, but has such a cool vibe to it!  The decor is perfect and it really speaks to whole feel you get there.  Plus, it was super clean, including the bathrooms, which is always appreciated with kids!  We were ordering for four children and four adults, and as first timers had no idea what we were doing.  The staff was SO nice and helpful with everything, and super welcoming!  We all managed to order (there's a secret menu too!), and waited anxiously while ogling over the super cute salt shaker, and choices of ketchups at every table.  I got the cranberry turkey sandwich on the \"skinny\" side of the menu, and balanced it out with the truffle fries.  It was all super good... Fries were amazing!  My husband got the chicken sandwich with the Asian coleslaw.  Sandwich was great (on a brioche bun!), and the coleslaw... Oh my.  Best I have EVER had.  I seriously considered asking for an order of it to take home!  Other items ordered and loved were the sweet potato fries and BLT sandwich.  The kids all got the chicken fingers and root beer floats... They were in heaven.    As far as drinks go, they have a great variety of floats, shakes and cold pressed juices.  Yummy fruit infused water is also an option.  And, we couldn't leave without buying some huge cookies from the pastry case!  By the time we left around 6:40, it was packed.  I can see why!  We all can't wait to go back for breakfast!  And lunch, and dinner, and breakfast again, etc. ; ). As a Vegas native, I'm SO excited to see a place like this pop up in town and wish them continued success!"}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch here with my husband.  This is my second time here.  We shared the buff chic and the steak berry flatbread with both truffle fries and sweet potatoes fries, we also had the cane soda (cream and black cherry mixed together).  Obviously deciding to go with the not so healthy options on the menu.  Each item we ate was better than the last!!  I highly recommend this restaurant... It's not fancy but it's delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Fast, healthy, and Eco-friendly. A bit expensive but that's because everything is fresh, organic and made on the spot."}
{"text":"Amazing as Expected!!! Same great food with more room and outside dining!! Boylan Birch Beer and Cherry Popper...great combo!! Daughter loved the chicks in Broadway and she said the bathrooms were decorated nice!!ha she's only 3"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place before even trying it. My coworker is also health-conscious and she came upon this place and really persuaded me to try it out. After the first visit, I knew I was going to come back multiple times (kind of a random place for it to be on Dean Martin so it looks like they're probably big on word-of-mouth advertising). The ambiance is nice and it's kind of small so if they're really busy you'll probably be without a seat. I wouldn't recommend big groups. Maybe a group of 4 or less would be perfect.  1st visit was mostly for dessert BUT then I realized they don't really have dessert because all the dessert-related pictures on Instagram are for their Sunday Sundae specials. I ended up getting a kid's sized order of Adventure Juice (juiced spinach, orange, and lemon, blended with strawberries, bananas, and frozen yogurt or ice cream) which was actually pretty yummy. I tried it with ice cream.  The Drunken Gypsy Toast $7.75 is an SF Crème bruléed Brioche, berries, bananas, whipped cream & syrup w/Applewood bacon and that was also really yummy. I liked the softness of the brioche toast and all the berries and bananas was nice to go with it. I was just pleasantly surprised with both things. Sometimes you come to a place and you're like eh, maybe I'll come back, but this one is a for sure.  It's always a plus to go out to eat and have delicious healthy options. For the ones that don't want to be \"healthy,\" you can order from their \"happy\" menu. I am definitely going to try a lot of their healthy-side menu options, though. They all look promising.   Also, check out their Instagram for new pictures of different dishes because it may not sound good on paper but it looks so damn good.  I will be back with an updated review :)."}
{"text":"So delicious, GREAT prices, awesome menu, cute eating area and very friendly and attentive staff!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service. Great food, variety of options on the menu and a good price for value. Thrilled I stopped in!"}
{"text":"I had the seared ahi tacos. Two tacos for $8 is frankly not that good of a deal, considering that Bomb tacos, which are also fresh and sophisticated, cost less per taco. At this price point it is a 3 star experience. The outside is nice seating except for many flies."}
{"text":"This was an awesome escape from the typical Las Vegas buffet meal. I had the steak eyes (biscuit and gravy but with breaded filet mignon instead) and it was incredible. Very good. My buddy had the filet mignon burrito and equally good. It takes a little getting used to about waiting in line to order so do your research and have an idea of what you want before you get to the front."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes yyyeeessss YAS... holy cow bell it's like having the perfect daydream come to real life ... but with food. The menu is awesome, creative and you'll get so many oral O's! Best!! Staff is quirky and on point."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is a unique restaurant aimed at pleasing both the health conscious and the hearty food lover. You first walk in and grab a menu as you line up to order. You get a number and find a table to wait for your food. Going during peak hours ment having to scout for a table that looked as though they were about to finish eating and pounce one they did to make sure you actually had a place to sit before your food arrived.   The food itself was pretty good. The new year's risollution was a bit small for a fully satisfying lunch but the taste was amazing. The burger and the melt were also very good and the fries were perfectly crispy. The protein waffle was probably the weak link of the table as it tasted like a plain simple waffle, but it did still taste decent.   SkinnyFATS was a pretty good and everyone left satisfied. Finding a table was a little frustrating when they are busy but not a deal breaker as it seemed everyone eventually found a table before their food arrived. Definitely would recommend trying, especially if you have a diverse group of foodies who both want healthy and hearty."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, this place impressed me FAR more than I had thought.  It took me a while to get it, but looks like the general idea of the place is that you have a healthy menu for items easier on your tastebuds and a happy menu for those who want more heartier and savory things (hence the name SkinnyFATS). Very convenient for those who want something a little less taxing on their tastebuds and also want to stay fit!  I was also very impressed by the selection of their menus - I came in, worrying it was solely a burger place, but they also have salads, fresh juices, breakfast items and desserts as well. They have such a good range of items that can fit everyone in a group. I can't wait till I get to come back again!"}
{"text":"I've only gone for breakfast, and YUMS. Eye-catching presentation precedes light, delicious foods. (I tried the Skinny side of things). Fresh greens.   I really should return for their lunch menu. BUT it's always packed at that time with people waiting for tables (it's really a pretty small place)."}
{"text":"As someone who is eats healthy but has a fast paced lifestyle, I am very happy that this place even exist in Las Vegas. From the first moment I came to this restaurant, I was hooked! The special menu items are amazing and a must try. My boyfriend is a huge burger fan, and this is one of his favorite places to grub on a good burger. A must try is one of their juices, and their black cherry soda is amazing as well. Overall, this place is a must go. I can sit here and tell you how amazing and wonderful this place is, but it's best you try it for yourself. Your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"This place is always awesome no matter what location i go to. The food is great the locations are pretty gnarly how they are set up. Ive tried many things on the menu and everything i try has great flavor and it is a really good portion for what you pay. My favorite meal that i always tend to get when i walk into any skinnyfats is the meltdown. A double patty, patty melt tyoe of burger with the sweet potato fries. Those fries are definitely the best sweet potato fries ive tried so far. Nice and crispy and soft on the inside dashed with a little salt to even out the playing ground for the sweetness of the fries.  this place is always consistent on the food and service which is why i always go back for a good meal."}
{"text":"Oh, SkinnyFATS, please, please, please bring a franchise to Phoenix! The concept for this restaurant is unique, memorable, and useful! If you're feeling like some comfort food, go ahead, pick anything you like and have no guilt because we're not going to even tell you that it's bad. Having a day where you're keeping an eye on your calorie intake or just want to know what the healthy options are? Choose from the skinny side and you can still enjoy great food! The veggie burger was amazing! The sweet potato fries were delicous! A win for everyone at my table!"}
{"text":"Food not bad above average...seating beyond terrible not enough and cramped as hell. I don't think the food made it worth the bad seating"}
{"text":"Well... This may not be popular but I'm not impressed.  First- no decaf coffee.  That sucked! I ate from the healthy side it was ok but nothing I couldn't have made at home in 5 minutes. My husband ate from the happy side, it was ok, the steak in the burrito was tough.  Very disappointing breakfast overall."}
{"text":"Had the Veg-TO-bowl today at SkinnyFats. Best thing I've eaten since I've moved to Vegas. Will be a regular since it's down the street"}
{"text":"Man, this place is delicious. Super energetic atmosphere and kid friendly. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is delicious. Price point is a little expensive, but I really like it here."}
{"text":"This location is closer to me. Love the layout and outdoor patio seating. Yes... The pallet furniture is a great touch too! So many options both good and bad eats depending on how you're feeling... Something for everyone. Very busy and first come first serve for seating. I'll be back. Get the nice to Greek you and order a custom juice! Super cute juice cups. I'm a fan! -miss yelp 2015"}
{"text":"I love this place, I been there maybe 3-4 times now. I really like their sweet and spicy shake! Its made with beet juice and ginger. Its kind of like vegetable ice-cream. Its wonderful actually! Got the Chix on broadway and it was soo good. love the truffle fries. I have also had the Cranburkey, and my  boyfriend had the Neat - Burrito it was ok.....Some fo the items are a little pricey, but def fresh and different food! they def have non stop traffic in that place."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is located in an industrial office area, seems really out of place. The inside has a really fun atmosphere and decor, with a mix of hand painted walls, pallets and bare metal to mix things up. Very much a place for UNLV students to work/hang out.  It's tiny, though. You'll have a hard time finding a seat during dinner time, esp. on the weekends. It's open seating, fyi. The menu is split into two sides, the \"skinny\" side that has healthier options and the \"fat\" side that is more comfort food. All the items have some kind of unique, gormet flare. Like the choice between sweet potato or truffle fries (fries made with truffle oil and spices). You can definitely tell everything is hand made and fresh, and all items served look as pretty as a picture in a magazine. Seriously, it all looks good. They even have a giant water cooler with fresh fruit cut inside so you can have delicious infused water if you don't feel like buying a drink.  The things I'm not fond of: the lack of seating, the lack of diversity in the menu, and the prices. The menu has items like a burger with eggs benedict on top, but that's the only burger. It's not an enormous menu, and a lot of the items included on it are sweet breakfast foods like pancakes. I love the truffle fries but with the menu as it is, I don't feel the need to go there more than once a month.   Also, it's very expensive. I'm kinda' surprised by the prices. But still, it's got some great twists on food and an fun atmosphere, so I'm still a fan."}
{"text":"Stopped here twice when driving back and forth from CO to CA. It's so good! Very busy both times I went, so order ahead and pickup or plan to wait in line for a while. Sweet potato fries are great, I was pleasantly surprised by the curry noodles! Salad with salmon was also great, although not as filling as I hoped it would be."}
{"text":"Came here for a brunch stop on the way to Vegas and was drawn by its high reviews. It is fairly close to the strip area and you can't miss it... there's a huge smiley face pointing to where the place is!  The inside is very small, so if you plan on sitting down, make sure you swoop a table quick and the most a table can really sit is 4 people, so if you have a larger party, it's probably best to to-go it or sit separately. Parking is okay if you're lucky to find one right away. And during rush times, the lines can get pretty long! My friends and I barely missed the rush time and came at 11am. The line was out the door when we were leaving!  Coffee is refillable so its a plus, They have spa water outside for you if you don't want to purchase a drink. The menu has really punny names which I think is super cute. Not only do they serve food, they also have some cool juices to offer ( I didn't try that).   I got steak eyes to split with a friend since we weren't that hungry. It was pretty cool, it's essentially an egg (cooked to your choice) on top, with country fried steak and a biscuit on the bottom. Kind of placed like an eggs benedict. I really enjoyed it and I think the biscuit was AMAZING!   The food is good and I think the price is a little on the pricier side. meals are good to split if you're not too hungry."}
{"text":"Love this place, lots of vegetarian options and some vegan. The \"stuff on curry\" is vegan and incredible! Everything is always clean and the staff is polite. My only beef with this place is it's always busy with only one cashier open. But still worth the wait every time!"}
{"text":"I dig this place, I feel like I am in north park or hillcrest in San Diego.  Basically, you have the \"Skinny\" side which is healthy of course then the \"fat\" side which is the complete opposite of the skinny side. OH be on the eye we passed it twice, we suck, we were expecting a colorful pop out sign and that's not what it was....  Kind of like a doppelgänger style menu. From the Skinny side I got the Ahi Srirachi taco, which had seared tuna, some kind of slaw, mango pico all on a soft flour tortilla. It was VERY flavorful and VERY messy!!   Also, I ordered, Ahi Taco-San, from the Fat side. It was tempura ahi with slaw, avocado aioli, also with mango pico, served in a hard shell taco. It was equally as flavorful.   I think I prefer the Ahi Srircahi taco most because I like soft tortilla's over hard. OH and the tacos are I think are pretty big, I think 2-3 would be fine for women to be full and men would be good with 3-6.  Chris got the Phatty Philly which had delicious sautéed portobello mushrooms, onions, and peppers, grilled TENDER filet mignon, and SLICES of blue cheese all served on a toasted hoagie roll.  Now I HATE blue cheese so I just picked some meat and portobellos off and tried them and OMG were they tasty!! I would get this without the cheese!   Our friend got the Chix on Broadway. It was a freshly pounded out chicken breast breaded to order, which I appreciated, on a brioche roll with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon, and cheese. He liked it and it was HUGE, plenty to share. I tried a bite and they flavor was there however with the crispy chicken, crunchy bacon, and the toasted roll it hurt my mouth and I felt it was dry.   Both Chris and our friend got truffle fries, they are shoestring style. I love that you can taste the truffles. The total for all 3 of us was $47, which included 3 sodas.   They are doing things right here. Got great flavors going on and you can tell they care about the food. I wanted to try everything, which I will eventfully. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFats you have won me over!  I thought I had an idea of what to expect through all the reviews, but even then I was still so surprised! This place does not seem like it belongs in Las Vegas, but maybe somewhere in California. It's almost like a restaurant inspired by Tumblr/Pinterest with all the colors, art, and overall interior decor. I had slight difficulty finding the place since it's located in somewhat of a office plaza. Good thing they have signs on the light poles stating, \"SKINNY FATS - YOU JUST MISSED US.\"  Anyways.. Me and my friend went during lunch time and all I got to say is that if you're planning on going here - TRY TO AVOID LUNCH TIME. This tiny place was packed! Luckily, they have somewhat speedy service and we were able to place our order. I opted for a healthy snack and a happy side which was the mini Gobbler and truffle fries. The mini Gobbler is basically a slider burger which upon appearance I thought I should have ordered more because there was no way this small burger and bowl of fries what going to fill me up.. Surprise! Surprise! I ended my meal with a full stomach and I didn't feel totally gross. I've never had a turkey burger and found this one to be very appetizing. I definitely did not feel guilty eating it and found my hunger satisfied.  I want to make a trip back here and indulge on a happy entree. This place matched up to my expectations and more. I left giving it a 2 thumbs up along with a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"I was a fan of the first one and now I'm a fan of the second one.  I cannot even fathom my excitement when I found out a SkinnyFATS was being opened on the Southwest part of the Valley not to mention this location was going to be almost TWICE as big.  The menu hasn't changed, but the decor definitely has improved. There's an outside seating area and a cool \"high table\" where the chairs are made of crates and pillows are stacked on. This place is definitely a good date night location especially if you're able to land a table outside because of the lights. If you're not a fan of the outside, don't worry.. You can seat yourself inside in front of their huge projector television screening.  I love this restaurant and will return shortly. (If you want a more detailed review, please refer to my SkinnyFATS review off their Industrial location)"}
{"text":"you can get skinny and fatty food off any restaurant's menu, but it's still a pretty genius idea to make this place all about having both options to make everybody happy. the crazy lines at lunch aren't exaggerated, but we luckily beat them by about 10 min getting there right at noon on a weekday. we even managed to snag a table as someone else left - yay!  i got the \"healthy\" cranburkey w a \"happy\" side of slaw chee. the turkey burger on its own was decent, but adding the slaw chee to the burger made it really great. all the flavors meshed really well together.   my friend went with chix on broadway w sweet potato fries - basically a fried chicken blt. it was good, but nothing exceptional. if you have a big appetite this would be good for you - i don't think i've ever seen such a big chicken breast before. the fries reputation on yelp was exaggerated a little imo - they were typical sweet potato fries.   overall i liked skinnyfats, and would go back if i'm in the area. my one complaint is that since they're saying certain things are healthy, they really need to back it up with nutritional values at least on their website if not the menus.   the cranburkey was definitely healthier than the fried chicken sandwich, but by how much? it was regular ground turkey, not turkey breast, so it wasn't exactly low in fat or calories. it was also a pretty big honey wheat bun - so i'm guessing probably a couple hundred calories for the bun alone? i'm not a calorie counter obviously, but it would be nice to have a little more info since \"healthy\" can be pretty subjective"}
{"text":"Finally out in Aliante! Good food just expensive. Have great options for healthy eating."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the salad that has the buffalo chicken and fried jalapeños w/ the blue cheese. It's sooooo good. Like seriously. I got it twice in 1 week."}
{"text":"This restaurant was like a breath of fresh air. The food was so delicious and the overall ambiance was so chill. I ordered the French toast and a side of applewood bacon and it blew me away. They also have really cool cups and the chocolate chip cookies are to die for! I will always make this place a pit stop on my list!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, made healthy and deelicious! It gets crowded here,  but sure worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is our second time at SkinnyFats and the food was decent compared to the first time. Very spacious dining area with a very nice ambiance with music and lights.   The service was great. Friendly smiles and very good customer service.  My girlfriend ordered the cherry popper with sweet potatoes fries and I order the meltdown with truffle fries.  They loaded our plates with lots of fries which was nice.  But... we order med rare for the cherry popper, and received med well. We still inhaled it non the less, but it did erk me a little because for a restaurant like skinnyfats they should pay attention to details."}
{"text":"SkinnyFats is starting to be one of my favorite places in Las Vegas! I have eaten here twice and have been impressed thoroughly on both occasions. The vibe and crew that works there are awesome as well! Get the Pineapple Jacks for breakfast, so BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Vegas! It was our favorite spot for food while on vacation. There soda is special also. I don't know the brand but still looking for it. Food is very good. Kind of small place and seating can be hard sometimes but it is a must try!!! Will be back great staff."}
{"text":"Long time Skinny Fat customer and I love their food BUT unfortunately the Decatur location does not hold up to the Skinny Fat standard set by their original location and their Warm Springs location.    To start off with the Balls 2.0 fell short from the ones we had at Warm Springs. They were dry and solid like an over cooked meatball and the aioli sauce fell flat. (Warm Springs did an amazing job on the Balls 2.0)   I also ordered an VG bowl dish that I can't recall the name but it had noodles, curry sauce and topped with fried chickpeas. It sounded amazing but when it came (and after the waitress left) I noticed no chickpeas. Being a vegetarian dish the chickpeas was equivalent to ordering More Cow Bowl and not getting any meat.   Maybe I missed the chickpeas? It's possible. So I rooted around my bowl for a bit like a hungry stray dog looking for a treat but couldn't find any. I asked my wife and she came to the same conclusion soooo I notified the waitress. The waitress was very apologetic and said she'd have the cook make me a side of fried chickpeas on the double. 10 minutes later, my dish getting slightly colder as I sat there patiently waiting as child waits for mom to finish dinner a different waitress/staff member came up to me to advise that they're almost ready.  My wife was finishing up her meal and mine still sitting there flaccid and cold chickpealess when my chickpeas finally arrive. The chickpeas were hot, crunchy and delicious. It would have complimented my meal well (when it was still warm).  My suggestion is to go to the warm springs or the Original location. Save yourself the trouble of a disappointing meal and take the extra drive."}
{"text":"So glad they opened on my side of town! You can't go wrong with ordering the cucumber boats, my personal favorite is the Salmon Overboard with a side of Jasmine rice. The Filet o fire is delicious and comes with fried jalapenos and buttery toasted bread. The sodas are all made with real cane sugar. Try the cream soda,  it does not disappoint! The food is always good and to top it off the staff is super friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Great food both healthy and scrumptious. I am definitely a frequent visitor. Service is always great, atmosphere is laid back. And again the food is fantastic. Everyone should definitely try at least one item on the menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. I like to eat out so when I do so, I love the option of a healthy and flavorful option. That is exactly what Skinnyfats offers. I had the Smoke in a Bowl and my cousin had the WTFrench Toast and we had an order of Brussel Crowe.  My meal was very good. It consisted of items like chicken, rice, pineapple, black beans and bell peppers. The dish is full of flavor and the yogurt sauce (I think it was yogurt at least) was soooo good on top of the dish.  The WTFrench Toast was deliciously different. So many flavors in one. The Cranburkey was definitely different but good. The Brussel Crowe was good as well. I would have to say it was like nothing I've had before in the flavor department. The sprouts were cooked just right.  The best part is it's not on the strip but it is in an industrial location which can be confusing when you're looking for the restaurant. Overall the food is good and people should check this place out."}
{"text":"First time trying new skinny fats location went here for a lunch date with my boyfriend, I ordered the meatloaf burger with sweet potato fries, he got the fish tacos, and also had the spinach balls. Everything was very delicious will definitely come back to try more items."}
{"text":"Place was very busy took awhile to get my food...I had the burger Benedict cooked medium well  with a cookie wanted the truffle fries with my burger  but they told us there fryer broke would give more stars if i could...for those reasons."}
{"text":"Yay! This place is good. There is a healthy side and happy side which means you can get a healthy dish or an indulging dish.   I tried the chix on broadway which is on the happy side... not going to post a pic since there's plenty already. It was a nicely breaded and fried chicken on a brioche bun. I liked the lemon-herb aioli but I would've liked a bit more on the sandwich.   Sandwiches and burgers come with a side. There is also fresh cold pressed juice available and large cookies.   I was a newbie and appreciate the friendly and helpful staff upon arrival who made suggestions.   I would like to come back and try a dish from their healthy side. :)"}
{"text":"Yes.  Many options for the skinny and the fats.  You will find something you'll like.  Must see - the restroom sex indicators."}
{"text":"I hate hipsters and the cool kid club, but they're serving up some awesome food here and that's why we will be back.   First time here, and the menu is pretty diverse and original. I already knew that I was gonna eat off the healthy side of the menu before I stepped in, but that \"Happy\" side of the menu almost made me jump sides. Ordering was very pleasant, the girl at the register was happy and funny and helpful in choosing our meals.   We had the Greek flatbread, Banana pancakes and the goat cheese club sandwich. We shared bites, all dishes were wonderful.  :-)  Seating is a little weird. All indoor tables were taken, and I don't care for the communal high table thing, so we had to take a table on the very small and crowded outdoor patio. But it's a gorgeous day so it was perfect. Lots of self-important diners, trying look cool. Fun people watching. Sat next to a really uppity older couple. Recognized an uptight, annoying former coworker having lunch with his boyfriend. Figures. He belongs here.   We loved the food and service....will definitely be back. :-)"}
{"text":"Love skinny fats atleast the good stuff on the menu some of there things just do not work, unique but don't work but I still go for my favorites"}
{"text":"Always have to get a cookie to go and the black cherry soda oh my..... But the jalapeno ketchup is so good I have to buy 2 bottles every time I go for my house #addicited"}
{"text":"Having been to another location and liked it we settled on this for lunch... but were disappointed. The Sweet Cheesus looked amazing and exactly what I wanted from the picture but the real sandwich, though good, was nowhere near the one spilling over with meat in the picture and was looking forward to.  If you closed the sandwich the bread hid its contents in entirety. Very sad.   My wife good an egg white burrito of some sort with avocado and was very \"meh\" about it.   It's food. It tastes okay. It's average...not 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"There doesn't seem to be too many good brunch places in this town but I definitely chalk SkinnyFats up to being one to check out. They have standard breakfast fare as well as some dishes that show a little more creativity, which I like.   I got the Bonjour Brulee which was on the \"Healthy\" portion of the menu. It was good but I was confused by the bread they used. Seemed like a roll (brioche perhaps?) that was cut in half and that was it. Which is fine I guess but everyone knows the crust pieces don't soak up nearly enough egg. It came with turkey sausage and berries on top with agave nectar so it was pretty tasty.    I wanted to get juice because they look really good but I couldn't bring myself to pay $9.50 for a drink without alcohol in it! Yeah...yipes! So I settled for a \"Jazz Hands\" which was still a little spendy ($4) for what was in it: sprite, ice cream, mango chunks."}
{"text":"We yelped \"healthy food\" and found this place!  When we first pulled up we were a little confused that it was located in a business/industrial area.  The exterior looks cute, but you don't really expect to see the amount of awesomeness when you walk in.  It has a chill, small, and quaint vibe.  The girl working the register on 3/18/15 was the coolest ever.  She would give us recommendations (since we were 1st timers) & if we picked it she would be so excited for us.  I loved her positivity!  My husband has been expecting that same type of excitement from other servers/cashiers lol - my guess is he has a new standard.  We loved it so much we came twice (breakfast and lunch).    We live in California, but plan to visit anytime we are in town.  Keep it up guys, we love you!"}
{"text":"SKINNY FATS IS THE BEST PLACE IN THE WORLD. EVRYONE TRY IT AND BELIEVE IT FOR YOURSELF. They always have sports and great food and customer service. Amazing environment and I go at least once a week. You have to try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Like all the other reviews stated, it's a very small location and crowded (especially during lunch).  Like the whole Healthy and Not-so-Healthy concept.  The wait wasn't really that long, no seating was available so we took it back to the office.  The box and bag seemed a little over the top, but I guess that's their \"thing\".  I really like good-tasting, reasonable, healthy food.  Ordered the Chickhumm sandwich with fruit as the side, VERY pleased.    :)"}
{"text":"The location is incredibly small, we had to awkwardly stand around and wait for a table. We got the Morning Mac which was underwhelming. The sauce was grainy, and the eggs were nowhere to be found. It was pretty much just a mediocre Mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Overall: 4  Food: 4 Service: 4 Value: 3  This is a cafeteria-style shop where you order at the counter and then wait for your food, rather than having a waiter/waitress take your order.  They have two menus here, a \"healthy\" menu and a \"happy\" menu. The design is pretty cute. I got the \"More Cow Bowl\" (a play on \"More Cowbell\") from the happy menu, which consisted of teriyaki filet mignon and veggies over egg fried rice. It was pretty tasty, and didn't feel as unhealthy as its presence on the \"happy\" menu implied."}
{"text":"Went here for the very first time the other day not knowing what to get. The girl behind the counter explained how you can order on the one side which is the healthy side and the other side you live happy!   I guess we were both in the mood to live happy.  My husband ordered the Waffle and Chicken and I had the Hot Chix Salad, Wow when they were both brought out we could not wait to try!!  My husband really enjoyed his. He had never had Chicken and waffles together so this was a treat for him. He let me try his and I thought the Chicken was so tender and the breading was amazing. I could go just for these!  My salad was really good. It had the buffalo chicken on top of lettuce which was really tender and lightly battered it was slightly crispy along with blue cheese crumbles, tomatoes, Avocado and fried Jalapenos.   Omg the fried Jalapenos I could make a lunch out of them by them selves!!! They were lightly battered and crispy and not spicy at all but the flavor was amazing! I am so hooked on them I want more now! :) I can not stress enough how good they were!  It was served with a Jalapeno ranch dressing that had a little kick to it and a perfect touch to the salad. The only complaint I have is I think it needed a tad bit more lettuce under it. There is a lot of toppings but not much lettuce. Otherwise it was very good.  The concept of this place is great. You are sure to find something you want to eat! So many different items on the menu which is cool.   We both agreed we really enjoyed it and are looking forward to going again sometime.   We highly recommend this place!! It is VERY good,  We had the coffee which was good a long with flavored creamers. After our breakfast/lunch we bought one warm chocolate chip cookie which came out warm and the chocolate was soft and the cookie was very good! A great way to end the meal!  We are fans for sure! And will go back. If you have never been here stop and check it out. We left just in time there was a ton of people going in as we left and not a table to be had. So you may want to go early or after the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I came to Vegas on a week where I was \"watching what I ate\" and was so bummed to be going somewhere where I knew I'd be tempted to eat horribly. Was so happy to see they offered a healthy side of the menu, and even happier to see that the selections were pretty innovative in comparison to any other spot that carries your basic typical healthy dishes (salads, chicken breast, steamed veggies, etc).    I tried the TeriyAHI sandwich, recommended to me by the cashier. So it's ahi tuna, lightly marinated with light teriyaki glaze, on 9 grain bread, with lettuce and tomato. So good. The bread was so perfectly toasty and grilled,  that you couldn't tell anything was even healthy. Like bread from a grilled cheese. Yum! Also got the sweet potato fries, which were amazzing. More sweet than salty. Tasted like dessert. Would definitely get this entire combination again.   Also got the something \"on a boat\", can't think of the correct name. Overall, chicken salad on a cucumber. Refreshing and light, definitely on the messy side.  Good but not great. I'd try something else next time. Would come back again to try other dishes for sure. Everything looks great here."}
{"text":"Away from the strip but amazing and healthy food. Could do with a little more space but they seem to be managing fine. Had the smotherland and it was filling before my trip back to cali. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I had to adopt a new way of eating and that happened to be by going on the Ketogenic Diet. And as I was on vacation during Christmas out in Vegas, I didn't know what to expect but doing a little research turned up this place.  It is seriously the most amazing place I've ever eaten at. Everything is either Keto friendly or they allow you to make changes and substitutions to make it that way. I had their Scrambowl on a bed of riced cauliflower with extra bacon and it was amazing!!    This place will always be my go to every time I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with great friendly service. The only downfall is the portions aren't big enough to fill you if you're really hungry."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. I've had a number of things from both sides of the menu (healthy/unhealthy), and I've never had anything that wasn't good to great. The tu-nuts (ahi in a cucumber boat with all kinds of goodness) is probably my fav, although the cold pressed juices are fantastic too. I haven't had any of the more indulgent sammies but they look amazing.  The only reason I hold back on 5 stars is the juices are extremely expensive. a 20-ounce is around $10. That said, I get 'em anyway. Really good stuff. The Beet It is my fav juice."}
{"text":"i was a bit confused as to why this place is called \"Skinny Fats\" thinking everything will be healthy much like \"LYFE Kitchen.\" I learned from the cashier  that for every food item, they provide the \"skinny\" (healthy) versus \"fat\" (happy) version of the same dish. At least, that's what I think the girl was saying...  Great thing is you can get breakfast all day here and i was craving for some waffles and fried chicken at 10p.m.   CHICK-A-WAFF-A-DOPOLIS -- 1 star.  Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I don't know if they bake it or how they seasoned the breading for the chicken tenders, but I didn't enjoy the flavor one bit. I ate 1 out of 5 chicken strips. The waffle was also an OK. I asked them  if it was some type of \"skinny\" recipe because it lacked in flavor and texture was a bit odd. Apparently, I was eating regular buttermilk waffles. Looking back, it may have been that I didn't get to slab on a ton of butter like the true fattie way of life, and dunk it in some full fat maple syrup. Hey, if I'm going to order off the \"FAT\" side of the menu, I'm gong to go big or go home.   THE ORIGINAL burger - 4.5 star.  I don't know if it's cuz I was eating some mediocre chicken strips and waffles immediately prior, this burger made my night. I was confused once again, what was \"healthy\" 'till my brain kicked in and I realized this item was listed under the \"FATS\" (or \"happy?\") section. Hence, it's a NORMAL burger, with bacon, sauce, cheese, and avocado on a brioche bun.   Truffle fries- 1 star. Is this supposed to be the \"fat\" version, because it sure tasted like a \"skinny,\" i.e. not as good as what fries or better yet, truffle fries normally taste.   Service- Great cashiers that are super enthusiastic to be working there.   So...I'm still a bit confused about the SkinnyFATS concept. There's a lot of semantics going on with them interchangeably replacing the words \"skinny\" with \"healthy\" and \"fat\" with \"happy.\" So wait, the \"skinny\" stuff makes one healthy, but not happy?  I went through a whirlwind of confused states trying to make sense of what was going on when I was ordering, and it continued to persist as I ate parts of my meal.    On a brighter note, I guess I can share a meal at the same restaurant with my vegan, vegetarian, \"skinny,\" and \"healthy\" friends while I shamefully order from the \"fat\" menu and stay \"happy.\"   Speaking for myself, I'd go somewhere else to eat a healthy meal, because it's just too dang tempting to see the non-healthy options alongside. And as for eating some fatty, happy, meals, I'd go somewhere else to \"get my fattie on.\""}
{"text":"We've come here about 4 times in the last 6 days we've been in Vegas, and it's been consistently delicious and well-priced. My favorite is the Vegwich, followed closely by the Chickhumm.   The space is small, however, the service is well above par. Also, a tad surprising that their coffee is really great since they're not a coffee joint."}
{"text":"A hipster hangout for sure. The turkey burger was dry, but otherwise the food was decent. Oh and I was into burgers way before it was cool. Just sayin."}
{"text":"I love their food! Lots of vegetarian options which I love. Although it's pretty busy during the day the line always moves at a good pace!"}
{"text":"So far my hot spot, I'm very picky with my food and this place always makes me smile.    Also they have great atmosphere, everybody's smiling all the time and if something comes wrong they always try their best to give you a great chomp-chomping  experience."}
{"text":"Stopped into Skinny Fats, after months of drooling over their Instagram posts, and was surprised by the office building location. The small restaurant was very busy on a Sunday morning but we quickly found a small table. The menu didn't show the Sunday's Sundae that I had seen earlier that day so I wasn't sure if that was part of their secret menu or something and didn't bother to ask. We ordered the chicken and waffles (chickawaffadoppolis?) and the Smotherload steak burrito. We also ordered a cucumber shake and a Hangover Cure juice. My chicken and waffles was better than I expected; juicy, crispy chicken and a crispy warm waffle. I was served about 2 tbsp of syrup and the plate was really big so all of that crispiness started to get dry and I just needed a little more syrup but when I asked for it, the gentleman told me no problem and never came back with it after passing by several times. It seemed as though all the employees were working hard but I felt ignored. The Smotherload was pretty fantastic and flavorful and the cucumber shake was refreshing. Again, I got unlucky and didn't care much for my Hangover Cure juice. It tasted like beets alone and I couldn't finish it. I should have known  beets would overpower the juice though, so I take the blame for poor ordering choices there. For such a small space, the vibe wasn't as warm and welcoming as I expected it to be but the food was good enough to make me come back and try other menu options."}
{"text":"I love the family service I was awesome love the off-line menu items and the cream soda."}
{"text":"Horrible service. They couldn't even comp something for having me wait 40 minutes for my one meal."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I came to eat off the strip. It's a very small spot so you may have to wait a little while for a table. Everything sounded so good but I went with the buffalo cauliflower and ahi tacos. We got our food pretty fast but I wish my dish was better than it was. The cauliflower steamed it boiled and was doused in hot sauce, I was expecting it to have some sort of breading or batter to mimic a a buffalo wing but it wasn't. The taco shell didn't seem to be cooked thoroughly so it was still chewy at the bottom. The ahi prices were cut in chunks which were way to big and overpowering for that taco. I enjoyed the slaw that it was stuffed with Ana the sauce was good as well. My favorite part was my BF's food, he ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was super good and fried to perfection. I could have eaten a plate of just chicken. The waffle was good along with the scrambled eggs. If I ever return to Vegas, I will come back and get the chicken and waffles hands down."}
{"text":"Very interesting menu, never have been to anything like it before. To say it was different is an understatement. When back in Vegas, I will for sure give it another whirl. I had the filet mignon egg white omelette. It was ok."}
{"text":"First time trying SkinnyFats though I've known about them for a while. They are much closer to home now, and the food being good is even better! I was honestly impressed despite expecting that it would be good. The price is average with the portions. Not too little but not overly generous. Their drinks are interesting and pretty good. Someone mixed up the root beer and birch beer soda so that was fun. Everything tasted good and was fresh. Half the restaurant is at the patio and the weather was warm and perfect for dinner when we went. All in all a great outing. I can't wait to go back and try more and taste all the catchups!"}
{"text":"Funky place and location but great food.  You can go Skinny or Fat (or what they label as Happy.  I tried the Whole Wheat Waffle topped with Strawberries and Yogurt Sauce.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Huge portions and creative menu. The pineapple catsup is killer! Probably some of the best fried pickles I've ever had."}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant on Yelp while searching for breakfast/brunch places. The reviews and pictures were so good that we decided to give it a try.   We came here on a Saturday morning about 45 minutes after they opened. The restaurant was already packed but the line to order was short. The ordering style is pay and the counter, get a number, and they will deliver the food to your table. The only thing is you have to just wait until a table opens up because it's a seat yourself kind of place. We had to stand and drink our coffee for a while but found a table right before our food came.  Since the Chikawaffadopolis (chicken tenders and waffles) had some great reviews I decided to give it a try. It was definitely not what I expected based on the reviews. My waffle was slightly overcooked and I was given a pile of what seemed like leftover scrap pieces of chicken which was supposed to be \"fried chicken tenders.\" The so called chicken tenders were dry, flavorless, ovecooked, with slightly burnt edges.  I saw 2 other diners that ordered the same thing get a huge pile of good sized, plump, juicy looking chicken tenders on their waffle. I only ended up eating 1/4th of the waffle a hardly any chicken. Sooooo disappointing!!    I usually tend to overlook some of the food quality if the service is good...BUT the service was pretty bad too. The person that took our order was friendly and polite but the server we had was pretty bad. She hardly smiled and tried to rush us out. After bringing more coffee to our table she tried to clear my grandfather's plate and he wasn't even done eating yet.   I will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"I had the Ahi Taco-San and it was amazeballs! I fell in complete love. The Ahi was cooked perfectly, the sauce was to die for, and everything was fresh. I took my friend there before a concert one night because he wanted to try the taco I posted a pic of on FB. He also fell in love and it was a perfect meal before the show! I will recommend this place to anyone. Friends that have gone off my word have all been happy with their meals too."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was an amazing experience! One of the main reasons was due to the young lady who took our order and helped us through the SkinnyFats experience! Adrianna was invested and knowledgeable.  Give that girl a raise!  Great concept!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I cannot rave about this place more!  The ambiance was great, and I loved the communal seating area in the front.  When ordering, the staff was both knowledgeable and super friendly.  I had the ahi tacos. Both versions, and I absolutely loved both.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the food here...got the sweet cheese us with portabello mushrooms.  Definitely a winner.  My girl got the ahi srirachi which I had a bite of...also good but mine was better ;-)    The real star of the show is the sweet potato truffle fries...yes you can ask for them that way and they are bomb.  Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"First time here and was greeted with a genuine warm welcome by Debbie. She was knowledgable and had a great attitude the entire time.  I've been to a place called Protein House and to me, this place knocks it out of the park. This place has healthy food, great presentation, great vibe and the pricing is very reasonable.   Cluck Moo was an egg white omelet with filet mignon and tomato.  Sweet Brown is DELICIOUS! Sweet potato pancakes!! They pour syrup over it beforehand and actually ruin it by doing that so I would recommend ordering this without syrup and just having it on the side. We had to send this one back because it made the pancakes soggy. The new order was so good though and I didn't even need to add syrup.   If you're health conscious or just looking for good fresh food, this place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying... The concept is great.  Execution is a completely different story.  We were excited about the menu and ordered quite an array of items. We ordered a burger and truffle fries, Greek pizza, ahi sirachi taco, hot-mame, and strawberry lemonade.  Let's start by saying I understand that this is a new place... Get it. I understand that they didn't anticipate such traffic... Get it.  So.... The key is to make your guest who will be visibly irritated at the chaos & lack of uniformity feel important and happy. That's not happening. The employees are just as confused as the people arriving!!! We walked in never having been here. WE see that it's crowded... Assume we have to wait, which is fine. The guy at the front wants to tell me about the menu.... I'm not dense or stupid.... Ill figure the menu out. What I would like you to do is answer how I'm to proceed with my 2 year old son and 1 year old nephew and two other members of my party. He tells me there is no list to put our names down on and it's first come first serve. The problem with that idea is that there was already a line out the door and people standing around waiting for tables...... Let's put it this way, it's just a shit fest. The Blind leading the blind.  Yeah you can take it to go..... BUT GO WHERE?!?? The place is on a desolate road near the strip.  They get a two because the food was good.  The other three stars they can get if I ever decide to come back to this place after they work the kinks out and get their shit together.....oh & after I visit every other restaurant that we'd like to in Vegas..... You know... Where they have seats and a staff. Not just food and a register.   The highlight was the strawberry lemonade... Which for the other two people with me was horrible, for me was great bc it wasn't sweet and literally tasted like strawberry, lemon, and water.   **side note: while there they asked a couple to move to the bar bc they were taking up seats at a table for a bigger party...... And people were at the ALREADY busy register asking for boxes and trying to correct wrong orders. ...... A MESS!"}
{"text":"The last time I came to SkinnyFATS they had just opened on Dean Martin and I didn't have the most pleasurable experience. I also didn't feel that their food was that great either. I hadn't come back to any of their locations since. (This was in 2013-2014 at least) I went with a friend who insisted. I begrudgingly agreed.  WOW!! I've been MISSING OUT!! That 2 Nuts though!!! For under 300 calories it's a pretty spectacular little lunch, not to mention clever in that cucumber boat.  I ordered the hot chix salad. Blue cheese, avocado, buffalo chicken, pico, fried jalapeños.  The whole experience was different this time around. Previously I wasn't aware that they had fresh juices. In fact, when I originally went, I really don't think they did. I'm so happy I gave this spot another shot, I will be a regular now without a shadow of doubt.  Also, one small side note.... how stinkin cute is the outdoor seating area at this location?!?"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome atmosphere! It's a hippy joint that advocates living life happy and healthy. The staff there are super nice and accomidating. Almost everything is made in house and the free lemon/lime water is amazing. I ordered the Berry Strong Waffle, but I asked for two protein pancakes to sub the waffle. The pancakes could have been better, but man o man everything else I tried off of my brother's plate was great (The Steakation with a side order of sweet potatoe fries). The plates aren't huge in terms of portion size, but you leave full, I promise. The prices arent too bad, especially when you're paying for such high quality food. Definitely a new fav, and an awesome diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"Exceptional concept!  Exceptional food! Exceptional service! And so close to home!!  I love how accommodating they are.  You can pretty much make any meal gluten free by putting the ingredients in a bowl of brown rice (which I didn't even realize was brown rice).  The jalapeno ketchup goes together so perfectly that one would think that is how ketchup should have tasted all along.  The plates that come out of the kitchen look more like art than food, so fancy!  The entire staff is fun and happy to explain anything or grab anything for you.  I love that they have natural soda in fountain style.  Great place in which I will eat often!!"}
{"text":"First timer.  Had the Bleu Balsamic Salad.  Great taste and healthy serving of meat and Bleu cheese.  It was enough for two."}
{"text":"Good food, love the concept and he secret menu. Great place that isn't on the strip and is affordable. Truffle fries are great... they have some really weird flavored ketchups though. Don't be afraid to ask for regular ketchup"}
{"text":"Wow. I feel like I'm at friends house and they made me a complete  and healthy breakfast. Kids loved it too. Great environment. Keep it up."}
{"text":"My favorite takeout! I'm so happy this opened near home because we were in desperate need of healthy fast food. As a busy mom of two and picky eaters in the house I needed a go-to place like this. Their menu is divided between healthy and not so healthy options ..hence the name skinny/fats. We normally order off the \"skinny\" menu and we've enjoyed everything on there. Their bowls, flatbreads and breakfast options are delicious. In addition, you feel great after eating them. Satisfying yet light!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving in Las Vegas, we sat in the rental car searching for a place to eat. This place became the top choice based off of Yelp and what we were craving.   I was confused but the place lived up to their name - Skinny Fat...lol. It felt like we were eating slightly healthy but still had the choice of some guilty pleasures. The place felt a bit small. The staff was very friendly and made our visit a pleasure.   The food was decent... I wouldn't say it was amazing, but it was alright. Would I return? Maybe. This was our first stop, but we seemed to find other places which kept us from returning. The portions were big enough but I felt like I was looking for something with a little more \"wow\" factor."}
{"text":"I am SO sad to have to lower my rating with this updated review, but today was just a really odd day for skinnyfats, and if I wasn't a super fan after eating here our first time back in April, I probably would have given it one or two stars because that's what today's visit deserved.   It took about an hour and 20 minutes to stand in line, order, wait for a table, watch the spectacle of people fighting over a table, hear people complaining to staff, get our food, eat some of it and send some of it back, and leave. Whew...it's only 12:30 and we are exhausted!   We ordered the steak eyes: steak medallions were barely cooked rare. Almost bloody and completely red. DISGUSTING. We didn't eat the meat. We threw $11.99 down the drain with that one. Biscuits were also very try and there wasn't very much gravy at all on any of. Between dry and hard biscuits and the lack of gravy and raw meat, it was terrible.   Chicken & waffles: it was ok. We won't ever get it again, but it was something that we wanted to try.   Chicken finger bowl and truffle fries, minus buffalo sauce. Chicken was burnt. Fries were fresh and delicious, but chicken was BURNT. Asked for a new order. Instead of 6 pieces of chicken, a mini order with 3 pieces came out. Took it to go because it took so long to be remade. BOMB.   I tried to be healthy so I ordered the pineapple whole wheat pancakes. They were decent. Very dry, though. Not sure if I love them. I ate one and threw the other in a box, which I will probably toss.   Overall, food was WAY OFF. Not sure if they are training new cooks or what, but it stunk today. And for $50 for everyone to leave sort of eh, that wasn't good. I was disappointed. Fam was disappointed.   Also, the food came out at all different times and some of us didn't get our food until others were almost done eating. Not good.   Service wasn't good today either, and that surprises me more than the food because last time everyone was SO amazing! Today the poor staff was just trying to squeeze between people without dropping plates to deliver food. Register girl looked higher than a kite.   Worst part of it all: people were yelling and fighting over tables. Seating system sucks and provokes people to fight for a seat. So lame. There should be a rule and system, that one must place an order and have a number before taking a table. And there should be a line on the left hand side isle way by the restroom where people should line up in order to get a table. Because when it's just that busy and wait times are that long and people are hungry, we were seeing the devil in them, and it wasn't pretty because I brought kids to breakfast, not a brawl.   Not happy, skinnyfats. You left me very disappointed today."}
{"text":"Seriously the best restaurant on the planet! Love love love skinny fats! And the best part it is 2 blocks from my house! Everything on the menu is super delicious! Very unique items with twists to some classics! Always leave happy! Get there early on Sunday's!"}
{"text":"This location is right by my gym which is amazing but also dangerous. I've swung in for a post workout snack, to curb some cravings, and also for occasional meetings.  The space itself is small with limited seating but has a very forgiving parking lot. You wait in line and order at the counter and they then give you a number and bring your food out to you. Due to the intimacy of the space this has become more of a to-go order spot for me rather than the sit down and enjoy your meal there kind of place.  Let me start by celebrating their menu and say that most everything I've tried has been tasty. They offer amazing healthy and happy options. Unfortunately, some of the menu items I love don't hold up well when you take them out. The Cherry Bomb wasn't put together well and the Burrito was sauced and caused it to be quite soggy when I arrived to my destination. I think just a bit more thoughtfulness when packaging things to go would go a long way.  Pro-tip: ask about their secret menu!"}
{"text":"Came here because the wait at another breakfast joint was out of control. Wasn't very clear about the ordering procedure either- Order at the counter, find a seat and they bring your food. Was chaotic and unorganized as you walk in. Okay prices for what you get. I ordered what I thought was a scramble, but it was a scramble on a sandwich? Not that many \"healthy\" options as people claim. The food listed on here and on the menu is not what I saw on the menu there or what I received. It was meh. Food was cold, when it should have been hot.  Drink came in a reusable cup that I could care less about. It was packed, we had 2 kids with us and it was kind of a cluster. Parking was easy, and its easy to find as its in a business park."}
{"text":"I come here as often as I can when I'm nearby. It's just a little far from home, but it's always worth going the distance!  I've been here a number of times and have yet to order something that I haven't enjoyed. I like trying something new every time, and it's always a pleasure!   There's a secret menu too! Ask about it"}
{"text":"Tried the Ahi Taco-San, Shrimp Tacodilla,  Mean Bean and Blaze of Thunder. All of it was great but I highly recommend the Blaze of Thunder.   It was really crispy, with a fresh taste and a nice spicy kick in every bite."}
{"text":"We've become regulars at this place. The staff is super friendly and the place has a unique vibe and athmosphere.   There's a healthy and happy side on the menu, I encourage you foodies to try both sides of the menu! Even their healthy side is really good! The items are fairly price as well, averaging around $10.00 per entree. They also serve some truffle fries that are really good with most of the entree.   I've had most of their foods here, but for this review I had the cherry burger. This burger is just to die for. You can get the meat cooked to your preference and it's topped off with veggies and a  coleslaw topping. They also throw in a fried egg to bring everything togetjer.   The only reason this review does not get 5 stars is because the location is very inconvenient and hard to find at times! Also the place is very limited in space so you might find your self vulcherjng for open tables against other people on busy hours!  Great joint! A must try for vegas foodies!."}
{"text":"YUM!! This is such a cool concept for a restaurant and they had so many delicious things to try! I'll have to come back whenever I'm in Vegas, just so I can sample the whole menu!! I got the smoke in a bowl and I literally devoured it in under 5 minutes. So delicious!!"}
{"text":"Came through on our way to Antelope Canyon and it was even better than we expected! I got a Wake n Bacon (bacon, avocado, egg on Hawaiian bun), bf got a Chix on Broadway (friend chicken sando + side of sweet po fries). Mine was delicious, it had a scallion aioli or something and the Hawaiian bun was a great touch. BF confessed afterwards that his Chix sando was probably the best he'd ever had. It was a huge slab of chicken, breaded very well and super tender inside. Capped it off with the lemon blueberry cookie--I'm a chocolate chip kinda person but I don't even have any regret going with this option.   Other than some questionable food item names (Flat Chix v Hot Chix ?? might want to rethink that), the food for value couldn't have been better! We'll def come again and recommend it as a worthy detour for any friends in Vegas"}
{"text":"I'm more of Fat (happy) side of the menu kind of guy, but that doesn't mean I don't dabble in the healthy side. Regardless of whatever side I choose to enjoy I always seem to be satisfied. This place has amazing combinations. My newest addiction is the Spicy Latina. This soup is incredible!   My only complaint, BRING BACK THE HOT MESS!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, great food.  The restaurant is a little small, but they are expanding.  Try the steak eyes.  A gem off the beat and path of Vegas."}
{"text":"This place looks AMAZING. The art on the walls is bright and just makes you feel happy. Bring your appetite!!! Then order the fried pickles!!! They're amazing! The music is relaxed and the atmosphere rocks.   This restaurant is different from the rest. Check em out! You really can't beat good food, a happy atmosphere, awesome decor, and did I say: DELICIOUS food?!?    I'll be back soon!! This place is very family friendly so bring all of the kids! There's a lot of seating so bring a big group of friends."}
{"text":"Had the patty melt (can't remember its official name there) but it was delicious and fresh.  Real fresh.  Food was reasonably priced, tasted great and I left satisfied.  Fountain soda was good, not your conventional pepsi-coke products.  Different brands tasted great.  A lot of lower calorie options with great variety, so if you like healthy and tasty, try this place out."}
{"text":"fun spot, nice menu. good food. One star off for some odd combinations (marinara with brussel sprouts). A tad pricey, but ok for quality of food.  Breakfast all day is awesome!"}
{"text":"Chickawaffadopololis is an outstanding start to the morning.  Also tasted the S'motherload and Wrap Superstar and neither disappointed. Great flavors. Fresh ingredients cooked to order. This was a heathy great start (ok maybe the chicken and waffles are stretching it) to a family road trip to Death Valley."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Everything is fresh and full of flavor. Fried pickles and nice and crispy, served with a Smokey chipotle aioli, yum! Burgers are great and definitely try their spicy chicken tortilla soup! Cookies are made in house, gotta have one of those."}
{"text":"I tried skinny fats after a hike one day to be good but their happy side just looked so delish I couldn't resist! I've been twice and always got great service and mouth watering food!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Somewhat of a hidden gem if you are costing Las Vegas. They have plenty of menu options for healthy eaters and also some Less healthy. We went all out!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. It's new, it's trendy, it's healthy and they have DELICIOUS food!!  The Nutella French toast is amazing and so is the buffalo chicken salad!! Try everything! I'd eat here everyday if it were closer to me!"}
{"text":"What a great find in Vegas.  Off the beat and path, but worth the short drive.  Four stars for how small and crowded the restaurant is.  Food is excellent weather you want healthy or not they have something for everyone.  Everything is made fresh and the food was so delicious.  This is a must if you are heading to Vegas."}
{"text":"Good breakfast with interesting/different menu. I had the chicken waffle which was well done and filling.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"One of our family favorites!  Two Nuts for sure!  The creative specials are crazy, but so good!  Love the staff too!  Try to go at off times because they get busy busy!  Fresh juices too.  My boyfriend loves the chicken fingers. They have a healthy side of their menu and a happy side, so there really is something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I have yet to be disappointed. I keep going back and trying something I normally would never have, the best part though is that it's perfect for friends on a diet and those not all at the same time!!"}
{"text":"I really like the idea of SkinnyFats. It's super cute and original, but I feel like the execution kinda falls flat. Here's the lowdown:   THE GOOD:  + customer service + cute decor + some select items on the Happy side, including the Sweet Cheese Us   THE MEH: ~ pricing ~ food quality ~ items like Slow Boat to China, Tu-Nuts, Ahi Taco-San, and the chocolate chip cookie are all just okay  THE BAD: - no seating when super busy - lots of hit or miss items - most of the Healthy side items, including: The Chickhumm: bland The Vegwich: bland and boring The Caulifire: literally just cauliflower tossed in buffalo sauce The Zucc It: tasteless Ahi Srirachi: the \":/\" personified Cauliflower rice: for the love of God, just don't get this. It looks like bread crumbs and tastes like nothing but garlic.  Overall, I don't recommend this place unless you've been here and know what's good (which doesn't include the Healthy side). It's a cute idea to have a healthy and happy side, but their healthy side just makes me sad."}
{"text":"In an industrial area. Nice people,clean and delicious food! Went there for breakfast. We had  the smother load (burrito), hashtag America (steak and gravy) and drunkenmonkey (pancakes). Wish we had more people with us so we could order more variety! Oh, they had a healthy side of the menu too ...im sure it would be good too lol"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place.  Appeals to my healthy side and also has fun options for after long runs. This place is incredible and I can't wait to move closer to it!"}
{"text":"Love the new avocado toast!  I have had it twice this week. A lot of flavor is packed in. May not sound like the best combination, but it is excellent. There is pesto, sundried tomato, and feta, along with a crunchy slice of whole grain toast, mashed avocado and an egg on top. Just the right portion, too. Fills me up, but not too much. Love Skinny Fats!"}
{"text":"I am very happy that this SkinnyFats location is finally open! This Downtown Summerlin location is perfect. They have a great patio and the staff is very friendly. There are many favorites to be had here. You cannot go wrong! A few of my favorites are the Tu-Nuts and the Avocado Toast. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try! Truly a fan of Skinny Fats!  The first time I went was around lunchtime, so I tried the Buff Chix- so yummy! Love the buffalo sauce!   The next time I went was for breakfast, so I decided to try 3 Happy Chicks. Again- so yummy! This is now my go to item all the time! Especially since they serve breakfast all day!  I would love to try everything on the menu! But every time I go, I always seem to order the 3 Happy Chicks!  It's a simple breakfast- just made perfectly!   The location is a smaller place, which is always packed, but I think that this is just part of the fun and experience!   The staff is amazing... full of fun, and awesome-ness, and just always in a great mood!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to visit anytime! Skinny Fats is one of my favorites! The name gives it away- take your pick... skinny or fat!? They offer a variety of items for a \"skinny\" healthy choice along with the option of the indulgent \"fat\" choice! I have eaten from both sides of the menu and either side you choose- everything is always yummy!   Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"Great stop for whatever is on your mind to eat! Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner! Healthy, sweet, spicy! Flavorful! Presentation is great! Very fun atmosphere! Was greeted by Vanessa and she told us about all things available to us. We got overwhelmed by all the choices and sat down with the menu. Chasen helped us with our food. As we got so focused on our menus the line got out of control and we were now number 10 in line to place our order. With the help of Chasen and and the wonderful young lady in the office we got it all under control. Lol! Made a great choice and shared a Cheese Us Sandwich, fries and fresh fruit with my honey and my adopted son, Chris indulged in the Cherry Popper and truffle fries. We all had a strawberry lemonade very refreshing. We enjoyed the hospitality from everyone. Angelika was very attentive to our needs and made sure we were comfortable and our drinks were filled. We all left happy and confident that we will return on another visit to Vegas! Happy eating everyone!"}
{"text":"I really like the ambiance that SkinnyFats has during non-peak hours. I see people complaining about how long the wait is during lunch and I don't know what they're expecting, but we came in at the tail end of the lunch rush and were able to get seating for 6 without any trouble at all.  It was a little cramped when we were standing in line to order, because it is a small space, but it's not like the staff can change that.  Everyone was really friendly!  Definitely going to be a regular for work lunches."}
{"text":"Great concept, solid food, & cute indoor decor....  I love the concept of splitting the menu into basically a skinny/healthy side and a FATTY side. Of course, we all know which side I would go with....haha. The food was decent, but not anything to write home about. I ordered the BLT with truffle fries, and the fries were super yums, but I've had better sandwiches in my time. However, the options for people with different diet restrictions is quite impressive. There are great GF and Veggie-friendly options, which makes group gatherings easy :)  It is oddly located in some weird industrial complex facing the freeway, so ambiance is definitely missing. But the decor inside is hip and comfy. It's kinda small and can get kinda crowded.   Overall, I'd definitely come back, esp with a group of picky eaters :P"}
{"text":"Skinny Fats is AWESOME! What a great concept. Having a happy side and a Healthy side really shows how hard it is to choose whether to eat good or just treat yourself. This place is really makes me fight my inner self. I've tried their pancakes (on the happy side of course) and they were absolutely DELISH. Hot and fluffy pancakes, overloaded with whip cream and marshmallows/oreos. SOO GOOD. Definitely can't go back to iHop or denny's after having these! My boyfriend got the Ahi Taco and one of the pizzas. It was good size, enough to feed two! But obviously he's a boy and boys can eat a lot. LOL. I've also had their salads which a tasty. And their nutella shake for dessert definitely put me on my happy side. :) This place is small but cute and lively. The workers are very nice and always cater well to your needs. If you don't like something, you don't need to have it in your order. Also, their free water is really yummy. They have different fruits in them on different days. I love the interior design on the walls and it's so detailed to the little salt and pepper shakers. Overall, it's a cool place to go to when you want quality food. Look out for it because you couldn't even tell where it is in its location!"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are delicious!! Fries seem to never be crispy, that's the only downfall. Friendly staff. I've been here quite a few times and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Healthy or not as healthy, the choice is yours. Be prepared for a taste explosion! Had the Cranburkey with provolone and avocado...off the chain taste!"}
{"text":"SkinnyFats has been on my bookmarks for months and I finally was able to stop by for lunch. When I arrived at 1130 there were still plenty of seats but the seating area is quite small. I liked how the menu was split healthy and happy, something for everyone.   The cashier was nice and patient while I looked over the menu. I went with the Deep Veggin and the TATS sandwich with truffle fries. At about $20 with a drink it was quite an expensive lunch. I wish I had seen the complimentary cucumber infused water before I ordered but oh well.   The food came out all at once. The deep veggin was okay but the sauce was way too spicy for me. There panko breading was very plain. The TATS was pretty good. The bread was toasted nicely and it had lots of spinach and avocado. I didn't taste any of the \"spicy yogurt\" however. The truffle fries lacked any truffle flavor and were quite plain.   Overall it was okay, but I can spend half as much and driver half as far for a much better lunch."}
{"text":"This was a great off-the-Strip find!  The menu offers delicious food with healthy options.  Some healthy food places lack flavor but this place isn't like that.  The Slow Boat To China app was delicious!  Their coffee was great also.  I'll definitely go back to this place when in Vegas from the East Coast."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the potential long lines that you may encounter at SkinnyFATS.  But after a trip to their original location and seeing that unappetizing long line and no seats, I decided to check out their second location.  The line was still long, but it was not as bad as the first one, plus the seating capacity is much improved here.  The menu looks identical, so unless I am deathly close to their first location, I will likely never go back there again.  If you can order online, that will probably be very helpful in saving time as well.  Service from the cashier and order taker was good.  The staff that delivered our order was also good.  Once you place and pay for your order, you are given a number, so your order can be brought out to wherever you find available seating, both indoor and out in the patio area. The weather was nice, and the building provided sufficient protection from the sun, so we eventually made our way out to the open table we found.  Eating out in the patio area felt like having a picnic outdoor, complete with the baby or fruit flies that wants to partake in the meal as well.  After looking over the menu, we decided to order the following:  Ahi Srirachi Taco: Seared Ahi, Slaw Chee, Mango, Pico & Spicy Yo-Aioli in a Wheat Soft Taco.  My Fav Asian liked it and that's all I needed to know.  She did add more habanero hot sauce to her tacos for more fiery kick. *Did they misspelled Sriracha on purpose?  Ahi Taco-San: Tempura Ahi, Sriracha Slaw, Mango Pico, Teriyaki, Spicy Aioli in a Puffed Shell.  This one is a winner, but probably not one of their relatively healthier menu items.  It is messy to eat, but I can't complain with the paper napkins within easy reach.  4.5 stars worthy all on its own.  Cherry Popper: 1/2 lb. Beef Patty, Cherry/Banana Peppers, Spicy Slaw, Pepper Jack & Fried Egg on a Hawaiian Roll with a side (Opted for the Truffle Fries).  Not sure why it gets positive reviews.  I thought it was just average or maybe the execution was just off.  Asked for medium rare, was served a burger closer to well done (it was still juicy and not dried).  The Hawaiian Roll did nothing for me in this burger, as it was not toasted and was way too soft and soggy after all the liquid from the slaw got absorbed into the bun.  I will pass on this one and done burger.  The Truffle Fries was okay. At $3.5 per order it is not expensive, but again the execution felt subpar. Half of my fries look and tasted overcooked (the ones on the bottom covered up by fresher, acceptably executed batch of fries), as if it was the last of the leftover fries scooped up from the fryer just before it has no wiggle room left to go except the trash and served all on my plate with the Cherry Popper Burger.  Not even close to McD's fries.  If I was not already in a good mood just spending the day hanging out with my Fav Asian, the rating would not be so generous to even earn the A-OK 3 stars."}
{"text":"Love it! Great staff; very friendly and informative about the menu. My 3 year old broke one of the cute  salt/pepper shaker, and the staff was very patient and kind about it. And great food too. I got Cinnutella; it's a great twist on your ordinary French toast. Hubby got the Ahi Taco-San, and it was great also. Didn't get to take picture of that. They have \"secret menu\" every day. It's on the little tv screen on the register counter. Ask about that!"}
{"text":"I had a salad and it was only around $4.  I'm big into value and let me tell you I took half of it home.  It wasn't the best salad that I've ever had but I wasn't disappointed.  I would return just for the pricing and portions!"}
{"text":"Yo skinnyfats,I like the concept but It ain't Ralph tho. I ate the the food and IT AINT RALPH THOUGH!!!! I heard the concepts, I read the reviews, I thought it would be a match made in heaven because I'm skinny but I eat like I'm fat but it wasn't going down like that First thing, the decor is nice but every time I went it felt so cramped and packed. I mean what's the point of a nice place if I can't appreciate it while eating my meal.  Now, let's get to the food. I don't know about whichever yelper is reading this but when I order a Philly cheesesteak, Im expecting a good mix of  steak and onions/mushrooms instead of  just enough steak that the sandwich could've been called vegetarian. I would also like to apologize for getting in the way of the breakfast burrito and it's war on taste or spices of any kind. The ahi tacos were a pretty bomb surprise. I can get down with those, same for the BLT. The tacos were nice and saucy, a very welcome surprise and the BLT was a BLT but the proportions and the bacon was right.  To be honest, I love the idea, I like what this could be but I gotta call it how I see it. This isn't bad but it sure isn't where it could be"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go and eat! Love the place, workers are very friendly and food of course is impeccable! One of my favorite dishes is the Nice to Greek you, so yummy! And I especially love that their menu is always changing, makes you break out of your box and try new things! Would definitely recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Food comes in nice size portions. The price wasnt bad at all! I had the chix broadway.. It was huge and really good. Its a smaller cafe type of establishment with a unique menu. I will be returning !"}
{"text":"First time here.  Tried the More Cow Bowl and Chix on Broadway.  Ordered online and food was waiting for us when we arrived and was still hot by the time we got home.  Husband loved the bowl.  Chix was soooo good.  Happy to have tried this place and will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  We were diving to Vegas and I was searching for a easy and semi-healthy place to get a quick lunch. BTW - the place is really close to the 15 freeway. Stuff was really friendly and helpful. We got Tuna cucumber boat - it was very fresh and delicious. We also ordered Cranberry turkey burger and Protein Waffle - they were really good as well. Great place for a quick healthy  lunch or snack. They also have a fresh juice and smoothy bar."}
{"text":"Been back here twice and can say everything I've had has been really good.  The fries were much better the second time as well.  I'd recommend the cherry popper burger.  It's a bit messy but quite delicious."}
{"text":"This place is legit! There is something for everyone...half the menu is healthy and half is Happy.  Super fun vibe and super friendly  knowledgeable staff.  Dillon walked us through the process...order at counter, they bring you the food.    Hubby had the Classic Burger...delish! The sweet potato fries were like Wow!  I had the Cranburkey. (Turkey burger with cranberries...just enough cranberry, not too much)  Great flavors and super juicy.  Lots of Turkey burgers are heavy and dry...not this one! Yum! The buns are very light too.  This place is definitely a Do Again!"}
{"text":"If you liked the the original SkinnyFats, you'll love this place!  Same amazzzzing food with way more space.  There is an incredible vibe and the staff was super helpful and friendly.     I'm very excited for them!  And for me!!!  Congrats!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food!! I have heard a lot about SkinnyFats and it definitely lived up to my expectations!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about SkinnyFATS, so I was excited to try this place out. The cashier that took our order was not friendly at all. A short explanation of how their menu had a \"healthy\" and \"happy\" side would have helped since it was our first time there. I honestly thought that this restaurant just served healthier versions of food that are normally high in calories, high in sodium, etc. But she didn't even care to ask. I'm a picky eater, so most of the menu did not sound great to me. However, I still wanted to give it a try, so I ordered the Buff Chix - I mean how can you go wrong with chicken tenders and fries right?   Wrong! The buffalo sauce was waaaay to salty. After the first chicken tender, I didn't want to eat anymore. The truffle fries were very soggy, tasteless and just drowning in oil. Gross! Their sodas were made with real cane sugar, but both the diet and regular cola tasted weird. I can't remember what my husband ordered, but he agreed that the food was not great.   The restaurant was clean. If you dine in, you will place your order at the counter and they will bring your food to your table.   Gave it a shot, but will not be back. I can think of a lot of other places where I can eat healthier food for less money and be satisfied!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for any meal. I love there menu and added menu wish they would bring back the ridiculous. The service is great Kelly and friends always take care of us..."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Vegas, in fact, probably gonna go eat there today. I get the ahi srirachi and berry the steak with a chocolate milkshake usually OR a random entree I've never had before since they're all delicious with a chocolate milkshake. Can definitely never go wrong with that combo.  Both locations are equally excellent, haven't had a problem with either ever in the many years I've been coming here. Good job, SkinnyFats~"}
{"text":"Awesome little hole in the wall joint! It's located in a business park so definitely in a strange area for a restaurant.  The food is da bomb! Haven't had a bad meal yet. Seating is limited and it fills up fast. Super clean inside which is one of my first things I notice.  Check them out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just had to see what the hype was about it was ok if the set us was better with how you order would be a good start and have people that are a little better with there foods maybe we'd give it another try"}
{"text":"This was by far the best breakfast place we've eaten at in Vegas! I had the Wake N Bacon and hubby had the Happy Ckicks and they were both wonderful! Wish we were staying longer because there's so many things I want to try! Lots of vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options too. Cute, fun atmosphere too."}
{"text":"This was one of our first stops in Vegas for food and it was absolutely delicious. The store front of the building is adorable and the overall ambiance of the place was great. I personally ordered the \"S'MotherLoad\" but my family also had the Avocatoast and Berry Strong. We all loved our meals. You can tell the ingredients the restaurant used were fresh, even the fruits. I also got an iced coffee that came in the cutest cup! We ate at the restaurant and it came with free refills for the iced coffee which was a pleasant surprise. At the end of the meal, we got a couple cookies for the road and they were also absolutely delicious. However, there isn't TONS of seating especially for large groups; we were a group of five and were lucky to get a table without waiting! I highly recommend stopping by SkinnyFATS on your way in or out of Vegas... Or if you happen to be around the area. I will be stopping by again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great food and very innovative concept! I love that we can grab something healthy, or go big and grab something fatty McFatFat. In this case, we decided to do both. The food overall is pretty tasty, though portions CAN seem a bit small depending on how much of a piggy you are (I'm extra piggy so I could easily down two entrees).   The Skinny Q was really tasty for me, though the GF crust was definitely GF (you can taste how crumbly it is), but the flavors were definitely there. Once again, portion is a tad small so you may want to order more.  Brussel Crowe: Not gonna lie--this didn't look that great; a hybrid between red vomit and chunky bird poop. Taste, however, was pretty good, once you get past the visuals.  Rosemary Jane: I looooove the Rosemary!! Yum yum!! Great concept, just wish the chicken was a little moister.  Yummus: Rosemary hummu--yup...more rosemary! This was absolutely delicious! A great appetizer/treat to get :)  Happy Mess: Truffle fries...with meat on top OM NOM NOM NOM Definitely appealed to my Piggy side. Do get this if you want something heavy and hearty.  The winner winner for me were the shakes--All three drinks we tried were absolutely amazing (go with the shakes!) and the cups we get are oh-so-cute! I would come here just to grab a drink to go...this location would be a 3 star for me, but them DRINKS YUM!! Do check it out!"}
{"text":"Always a great place. Had the buffalo chicken nachos and special grilled cheese Benedict amazing. Craving both again"}
{"text":"Being on a keto diet is not that easy especially when you are eating out. It is very hard to find restaurants that can cater to your dietary needs and cater to your children's needs as well. That's why I like Skinny Fats! Because they can customize my order and they have menu items available for those who are not on a diet. On top of that the food is delicious and the price is reasonable. The menu is not that large, which in a way is good (or bad) less choices can be less head ache right? But the great thing about it is that you can order your burger with No bun and lettuce instead and they do have a lot of great tasty options and the serving size is perfect."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. Unique take on popular dishes. I recommend the Turnip Taco which is actually a filet mignon taco. truffle fries were kind of stale though and juice is pricy."}
{"text":"Why did we wait to long to try this place?!?!? I feel like we've deprived ourselves from so much good food. I ate the More Cow Bowl and the hubby had the Curry Bowl....the bomb.com. There are 10 other things we want to try on the menu. Casual but hip atmosphere. Service was great. Music was great. Food was great. No complaints and we will return asap!"}
{"text":"The food is really delicious and they offer the \"healthy side\" which is under 600 calories. It's an American style restaurant with burgers, drinks and salads. The location is awesome! They got a nice indoor and outdoor seating are. Outside you also have a fireplace table. It's cute and nice here. Inside you can sit at the bar or normal tables with chairs. Catering is available."}
{"text":"Great food! You can go for the healthy menu or fattening menu. I have always been pleased ordering off of both menus.  Kimberly Harrison"}
{"text":"My friend was upset when we first arrived thinking I took her to a healthy restaurant but immediately got excited when we walked inside and saw ALL OF THE CHOICES!!!   Everything looked good!! And it was!  Staff was super nice and patient. Explaining everything.  I got the breakfast burrito yum!, the TRUFFLE Fries AND sweet potato fries were so delicious!!!!!! My sister got the black bean burger. It was large and really tasty (almost made me forget it wasn't meat). My friend got the cinnutella (sp?) pancakes and I almost ate her plate!   Definitely Coming back!"}
{"text":"Got one of their salads here, it was delicious! The cashier was sweet and helped me in my confusion of what to order and told me what is popular in terms of the type of food I was looking for. Their menu also has the option of either eating healthier or fattier which was nice. Be aware that claiming a table/seats is a pain though since it gets crowded here and there!"}
{"text":"It's super busy, they have their own soda, but other than that the food was ok. I came to try it out and personally it just wasn't my cup of tea. Didn't love it, it wasn't bad but not good enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"SkinnyFATS is easily my favorite casual restaurant in Vegas. I almost dont want to write a review just to keep it my little Vegas secret from the rest of the world who has yet to discover this delightful place nestled within some industrial buildings on Dean Martin Drive.   I am a foodie who lives a pretty healthy life full of fitness and so most of my diet consists of healthier selections. When I found SkinnyFATS, my world was changed! They provide a nice big menu with a \"skinny\" side of options as well as a \"happy\" side of options. Both the happy and healthy dishes are both loaded with unique flavor which can be so hard for restaurants to accomplish.   I have had both breakfast and lunch options, both healthy and happy. the whole wheat protein pancakes with two pieces of turkey bacon are a must anytime I go! I look at them as a dessert so I'll get them with one of the delicious sandwiches or other items they offer.  I love the atmosphere of this place and the staff always so helpful and friendly, ready to answer any questions you may have about the menu..they always have daily specials so be sure to check those out before making a final decision on what to order. It's \"casual\" dining in that you order at the counter and then find an open table and they bring you your order when it's ready. It's a pretty small place and I have seen it get busy which makes me a little sad because I want SkinnyFATS to forever be my Vegas secret!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, so yummy! And you feel good eating there with all the clean ingredients. Highly recommend getting a taxi and checking it out for lunch or breakfast before you leave Vegas"}
{"text":"Love this spot   I had the filet steak salad with goat cheese and strawberries and a light dressing. It was so good. It was on a bed of spinach so if was also super healthy.   This spot is always really clean and the employees are attentive and friendly. And are very knowledgeable of there menu and help you decide if you don't know what you want.   I'm always impressed when i come to skinny Fats this isn't my local location I normally go to the one on Decatur and 215 but I was in the area seeing my dentist I figured might as well stop in for a great satisfying meal."}
{"text":"I ordered ahi taco san and buff chix... Both were delicious! The sauce on the ahi taco san is so good; a must try! It's a small restaurant. I'm glad we tried this place; it was right next door to Impact Archery! I can't wait to re-visit and try out their other dishes. :)"}
{"text":"So,  the hubz and I gave skinnyfats another chance. I got the tunut boat and OMGGGGHEEEEEE it was delicious! My husband got the shrimp tacodilla and he liked it.  We also had ordered the happy mess truffle fries and it was pretty good. Staff was very nice and helpful,  we definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I loved skinny Fats The healthiest meal and I loved the sweet potato fries  Gr8 options  you can be healthy or  Indulge if you dare"}
{"text":"Hopefully you are reading this review because you are like me when I say SkinnyFats might be my new religion, if you are reading it to determine if you should go visit SkinnyFats you are wasting your time and should be already driving there. I do not have one bad thing to say about this place. The food is consistently good (both locations). We went two nights in a row because we just can't get enough. The first night we dined at this location we had the pleasure of sitting next to the parents of the executive chef. We were able to meet the chef and shake his hand to congratulate him.   Chef Josh Green is by far the sickest chef when it comes to flavor combinations. Everything we have tried has left us looking like Sally from the diner scene in When Harry met Sally. Our favorites are Tu nuts, Happymess, and chix on Broadway. We have full intentions on trying everything  on the menu."}
{"text":"First impression of SkinnyFats was most of the food we ordered was hit or miss. I came with some friends for lunch last weekend around 11. The place wasn't packed yet but it was getting there. We found a corner table and ordered at the counter once our entire party had arrived.   I opted for the cranburkey with a side of slaw chee. We got truffle fries as well. My friends ordered various other items and we waited for our food. It came out pretty quickly. We ordered items from both the healthy and happy sides of the menu for good measure. The fries were tasty and very truffle-y. The cranburkey was a bit on the bland side. I have to admit, I'm not typically a big fan of turkey burgers so that May have been my own fault for ordering this. My friend was a little unimpressed with her salad, saying it was a little bland and wishing there was more flavor and diversity in texture. She enjoyed her turkey slider, though. My other friend got the drunken gypsy French toast and seemed to enjoy it quite a bit. I had been  tempted by the healthy breakfast items, so I'll likely go that way if I ever come back again.  Prices weren't horrible but it got pricy when we had add one and for drinks, which we ended up skipping. The restaurant is tiny and 30 minutes into our meal there were quite a few people hovering around waiting for tables so we didn't stay long to chat knowing people were waiting. This made it a less than ideal place to go if you're hoping to have a leisurely brunch with friends to catch up.   SkinnyFats is bordering between a 3 and 4 star for me, but I think I'll need to give them another try to see if there are any other menu items I might enjoy more."}
{"text":"Skinnyfats has been hit or miss for me as far as food, but I think they've finally found their groove and after visiting their newest location on Warm Springs that boasts a larger dining area, I can finally buy in to the concept.  The location is larger than their original location but the seating is still pretty tight. You order at the counter and they bring your food out to your table when it's ready. I have had the turkey burger on a previous visit and found it to be a little dry and flavorless. Fast forward to this time, I actually really liked it. They seem to be taking constructive criticism and improving which has done a world of wonders.  Service was good and aside from a few hiccups everyone was very nice and helpful. If I return to Skinnyfats, I still I'll stick to this location."}
{"text":"When I walked in to SkinnyFATS my first reaction was \"wow\"! Not only do they have such a cool atmosphere with paintings on the walls and a very hip decoration overall, but the people who work there are very friendly. We walked up to the counter and I was surprised to see that they have a concept that I had been thinking about for a while, to have a skinny menu and a fat menu. They had tons of options and both the skinny and fat sounded delicious. I ordered the curry noodles (from the fats side) and the guy who took my order asked me if I wanted to add protein to it. Since I have been a pescatarian for about 6 months now, I decided to add shrimp. My friend ordered a burger I think, and we shared a side of the cauliflower. I liked everything, I didn't give them 5 stars just because the description of my plate said \"crispy chick peas\" and they weren't so crispy, also because the cauliflower didn't have that much flavor. But other than that, everything was good. I also had a juice that was called the Hangover Curer. It was really good, and they have these cool plastic cups that are very resistant and can go in the dishwasher so you can reuse them, I loved that. Too bad we found this place on our last day in Vegas, otherwise I would have definitely gone there more times to check out other food items on their menu! If I ever go back to Vegas, I'm stopping by for sure!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant.  Bar seating along the window.  About a dozen or so tables.  This establishment gets cramped and crowded.  We arrived at an odd hour, and they were already busy.  I suspect that during lunch rush, it gets quite hectic.  Line up at the counter, place your order, hope for a table, and wait for your food to arrive.  Chix on Broadway was my choice (I think). I might be wrong.  It's been 8 months since we ate there.  It was a breaded chicken breast with yummy toppings/fillings and a yummy sauce inside tasty bread.  Was pretty good.  I ordered some Truffle fries with it, and it was tasty as well.   (3.5 stars)  Cherry Popper was my wife's pick.  We both liked her choice better than my own.  This burger was very good!!  I did not see any cherries popping inside it.  There is a 1/2 lb beef patty, fried egg, pepperjack, spicy slaw, and pepper marmalade in a Hawaiian roll.  Put all these ingredients, and it was exceptional!!  Paired nicely with the sweet potato fries she had.  (4.5 stars)  End your meal with one of their delicious cookies!!  Las Vegas has so many great restaurants.  SkinnyFats is one of the better ones we've tried.  As a tourist, it will be awhile til I return.  If I was a local, I would be dining here a few times a year."}
{"text":"Very yummy and interesting food choices; my family ate everything super quickly like we were No-Face from Spirited Away. I wish the restaurant was better lit. My only other complaint is the continued use of these type of glass ketchup bottles (see picture). SERIOUSLY why are these still in use?????????? It took minutes in minutes of violent shaking for just a nanoliter of ketchup to reluctantly slither out. Sád!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere and food.  We had the balls 2.0 delish!  Wife had Smoke in a Bowl.  Too Healthy for me.  I had the Ahi and Shrimp tacos.  Great flavors and combinations.  Its a bit pricey, but the food is exceptional.  They need one in Henderson which the counter girl said that they are opening."}
{"text":"Delicious but always so busy. They need to find larger spaces for their restaurant, as people are literally falling over each other with no where to sit."}
{"text":"I absolutely love SkinnyFats. I took my mom there for the first time a few weeks ago, and we both have been dying to go back ever since. We ordered the Cranburkey and the Skinny Q. I really enjoyed both, but the Cranburkey could have had a little bit more sauce on it. The decor is super cool, but the place is a little small and in an odd location. Having just a tad bit bigger space would be great to give a little more room but keep the small company/community feel, and having it closer to other shops would bring in more business. I have to make a special trip to SkinnyFats because it is not near anything place I normally go, but it is well worth the trip! I love the concept, and I'm very excited to try more dishes! Great, reasonable prices too!"}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST IN LAS VEGAS.   We left and were so full, but felt energized - that feeling you get after eating WELL! We were ready to tackle the day in good old Vegas. Thanks SkinnyFats!"}
{"text":"From the moment you are greeted walking thru the door until the staff thanks you for coming we had a great experience.  Friendly staff, excellent food , and a great climate made for an enjoyable meal. Highly recommend.  Nice music playing, not too loud, but upbeat."}
{"text":"My new favorite - fun, imaginative, friendly and best of all tasty  food. Been to two locations; Durango and north Decatur.  North D is larger but has no less charm than the Durango location.  Being kinda located between them I would choose north D for a better chance at a table.  All god cooked to order and fresh.  The menu is creative and tasty.  Chicken and waffles is a favorite"}
{"text":"The huge Smiley face and art inside greeting you is a nice touch. I absolutely prefer the happy side of their menu. The cucumber boat with tuna, TuNuts is one of my favorites, as well as the tuna sriracha tacos. I like that they usually have flavor infused cucumber water or so. The line can be a little long at times."}
{"text":"There food is absolutely amazing. The first time I tried SkinnyFATS was at the Dean Martin location. Yesterday, I decided to try the Warm Springs location. First, let me start off by saying it was busy. That's always a good sign in my book. I ordered the Cherry Popper burger. It was amazing. It's $12, so a bit pricey for a burger, but that included a side. My boyfriend ordered off the breakfast menu, the Smotherload, I think. That was yummy as well. My little sister got the classic burger. I can't remember if that's what it was called though... but anyways. She ate the entire thing and the fries. So, there's no way she could have gotten something from the kids menu. Haha. Our bill came to about $40 for the three of us. I would complain about the prices if the burgers didn't include fries... but they did.   My only complaint was the LONG wait to order. Seriously. We were in line forever ! There are 2 registers, but only one person was taking the orders, filling various drink orders, etc. It took absolutely FOREVER to order. I went back up to order a drink later on. There were 2 people in front of me and one at the register. I was in line for an additional 16 minutes. 16 minutes to order a drink !   But anyways, besides the busy, rush-hour, my experience was great. Th only reason I'm docking a star is because of the long ordering process. There should have been someone else taking orders. Or at the bare minimum, someone help filling the behind-the-counter drink orders (hot water, coffee, strawberry lemonade, etc)."}
{"text":"Both times I've been, I have loved the food I ordered (Ahi Taco-San and Veg-to-Bowl). The Veg-to-Bowl had big chunks of pineapple, tofu, and bell peppers, was very filling and super flavorful. I would definitely order it again. But besides those dishes, there aren't a whole lot of vegetarian/pescatarian options which is really my only complaint. Yes, it's a small place, but it's not unbearable. Service has always been quick and very friendly, which is really all you can ask for at a place like this. Definitely a repeat spot!"}
{"text":"Always greeted upon entry. Every single time. Super friendly staff. Food is on POINT. A bit pricey but hey you get what you pay for, and wait for! Wouldn't really change a thing about this place except maybe a larger dessert menu"}
{"text":"Happimess is my absolute favorite dish here. At random I'll try something new, but always end up going back to Happimess. Truffle fries topped with steak, Pico de Gallo and blue cheese crumbles. I recommend adding some of their fabulous jalapeno ketchup as well."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for over a year now, and finally made it! I'm glad I did. It is a fast-service type of place, where you place your order and take a number to a table. Service was perfectly friendly and the bussers come quickly and often to clear the tables.   Food:  I had the Smoke in a Bowl (\"smokin a bowl\"?), which was good and flavorful. My boyfriend had the cranburkey burger and sweet potato fries. The burger was a little dry, but with some of that delicious jalapeno ketchup was very good. Both items came from the \"healthy\" side of the menu, but I don't think either of them was really that healthy. I think in the future, I'll probably just give in and go for the \"happy\" side.   It's a little pricey, but the portions are well-sized and tastes good."}
{"text":"Love the service, food, and environment. You get to pick the healthy side menu or the happy side menu. They dont have soda here but they offer fresh juices but its kidna pricey. The only negative i experienced was when my wife and I were eating at the patio the guy was cleaning the floor infront of us and I thought it was kinda rude because of the dust flying around. If you like being healthy i recommend eating here."}
{"text":"My favorite SkinnyFats location in Las Vegas.  Plenty of table space and seating.  Friendly staff that have been more than helpful.  The food is always top notch at any of their locations but so far the space is just right here.  Highly suggest trying this spot out if your in the mood for great food."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more.   Like everyone already said, it's hard to find. Although they do have little signs on the lamp posts that let you know you missed the building, cause it's bound to happen.  The restaurant is just too small, although I did go over lunch and it was incredibly busy. But it was off-putting. We couldn't sit until someone else got up from a table, and that just felt a tad awkward.  I ordered the burger benedict. It was OK. Apart from the fried egg in the burger, nothing was \"benedict\" about the burger. I was thinking it would have hollandaise on it or something a bit more. And the burger meat was slightly underseasoned. The truffle fries are epic though and very addicting.  The bf had the neato burrito. It was a breakfast burrito. Nothing remarkable about it.  We tried them at Bite of Las Vegas and actually enjoyed it more there. I got the Chix on Broadway there, which was super yummy. Bacon makes everything better. We also tried the ahi siracha tacos. I know these are one of their best sellers, but I just thought they were OK.  Like I said, I really wanted to like this place, but it was just OK. I probably won't be back anytime soon, at least not until they expand or something."}
{"text":"This is a hidden breakfast-brunch place. Ambience is really casual and laid back. When we got here there was a line to order from the counter. They have a fair variety in their menu and lots of healthy choices to pick from. I don't remember exactly the name of the dish I ordered but I attached a picture. I'm sad to say that the potatoes were better than the actual main dish.  For the sandwich- the avocado was bland, the eggs were bleh, and the bread was so thick it didn't allow me to enjoy the rest of the ingredients. The chicken and waffles were ordinary. Chicken was good, waffles were not overdone.  If you want water, they have a station near the bathrooms where you can serve yourself whatever infused kind they're offering in a really tiny cup. For having so many good reviews, I was very underwhelmed with this establishment."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Flavors in the dishes we tried were out of this world. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Luv Luv Luv this place. It's delicious .  The place is cool inside the vibe is modern bohemian."}
{"text":"When you're at Skinny Fats, you've entered the ultimate temptation. Your mind is telling you to go for the Skinny but at the same time you're tempted to choose Fats. So you stand there ideally looking at the menu hoping to narrow it down to at least two entrees but it's difficult. As you near the cashier, you're really pressured to select the ultimate meal that highlights your night. And that's exactly how I found myself being in love with their chicken waffles.   Uhm, yes. I've succumbed to the dark side with chicken, waffles, and syrup, synchronized together into one perfect bite. I'm a huge fan and while it's been a while since I've last visited, I am also tempted to purchase a smoothie to go. And pretty much everything they offer. Seriously, just give them all to me.   The service here is always friendly. I remember going on 4-20 and they were offering cookies. As if you need more reason to like them, right? It just keeps getting better.    Also, my girlfriend is a big fan of their burgers. She can't get enough of how delicious they are. I often make fun of her because she always says that she'll get a bowl but right when she gets to the counter, she immediately changes her mind as though getting something other than a burger is a sin. But I mean, I can't blame her. They are pretty damn delicious.   One other thing I like about this place is that they are vegetarian friendly. I love how they have a few meals on the menu so our vegetable-loving friends can also have something here too!   I'm definitely coming back here sometime soon. A real Las Vegas treasure, for sure."}
{"text":"Okay so this place is a BINGO. Quick, interesting, relatively healthy meals! Awesome shakes and smoothie options. Price is decent, only downside is it is a bit small so lunch/dinner rush time can be a bit troublesome. Get the Neato Burrito!"}
{"text":"08/26/15 Today we came back to have dinner and I want to say thanks to Charity for reaching out to me after the fact that I had gone prior and had hard bread on my previous meal. Today I ordered the mega health club and the bread this time was not hard at all. The staff was all very helpful when l explained my situation and I can say that I am very satisfied with my overall experience from the food, to the service, and also with their great management who reached out to me and helped me out.     08/17/15 Usually I try new things every time I come here since I haven't found one thing I particularly am fond of yet. This time I tried the bomb diggity. I was expecting a good warm sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were warm and tasted good, but the sourdough bread was  really hard. It was hard for me to eat so I was only able to finish half of the sandwich."}
