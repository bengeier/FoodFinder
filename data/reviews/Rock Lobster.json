{"text":"Cuisine for both meals was very amazing. Turn around time was exceptional. Presentation was fabulous. Wait time was only a few minutes. Over all a very solid experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"Very good service very good sushi would definitely come back again but  apparently I need to add more words to review so Yelp short and sweet is just fine stop making people write longer reviews and my friend says a chimi changa roll is epic"}
{"text":"Awesome service. The dirty South is delish and a must have. The atmosphere and friendly people is an extra plus plus!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was very FRESH tasting, nice and buttery as well. I got sushi and sashimi and everything was top notch quality. I got Tuna, Sweet Shrimp, Salmon and Yellow Tail.   The rice was perfectly cooked with a tiny bit of stickiness. I would rank this sushi place as one of my favorites. I wasn't too thrilled at the special rolls, being that I am not a fan of cream cheese and crab stick, but the actual sushi itself along with the service was great."}
{"text":"We've been going here since they opened as The Sushi Room, but hadn't been there in a while so we decided to stop in last night for hubby's birthday. We didn't have a reservation so we were told that we could sit at the bar or outside.  It was pretty crowed, so we sat outside on the patio.  It was dark so the menu was kind of difficult to read...the font on the menu could be darker to make it easier to read.  Service was great, super fast and friendly.  We waited for nothing!  The food was great!  Made for a great birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Rock lobster is an upbeat cozy restaurant with great customer service. I love the common area hand wash station. Great job to all the staff!"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is awesome. The kids sodas are delicious. The portion size of the tempura ice cream was decent and the flavor itself was great. The music was random but it seemed upbeat. The food was awesome. I think the sushi and the rolls were perfect. The new teppanyaki table cook was pretty cool. The server was nice, honest, and knowledgeable. I do like the Mother's Day free roll as a bonus! I would defiantly come back to this great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Counter was a little dirty, and when we walked in, there were several tables that had not been bused.  Did I mention that the food was good?"}
{"text":"First time here and was amazed at how great the sushi and service was. I will definitely be coming back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Rookie hostess on a busy Friday night, not good business. If you guys are going to ramp up your business you had better get some talent. Offering people to sit outside in 105 degree weather shouldn't be the first option given to a REGULAR customer."}
{"text":"My husband and I plus some friends had dinner here last night for the first time. The salmon dish I ordered was burned. My husband and one of our friend ordered orange chicken, very bland. Worst meal we ever had, luckily we had a good time with our friends to offset the terrible meal. NEVER coming back!"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour specials. Sometimes they get our order mixed up but they are quick to make it right. Great happy hour prices, wonderful patio, and the music is fun."}
{"text":"Good food AND good service - a rare find! We started with coconut shrimp, which came with a coconut-pineapple sauce. For $10, it would have been nice to get one or two more, but they tasted great. We got two different sushi rolls: eel & cucumber; and da bomb. Both were good-sized rolls, and tasted great. We also tried various teppan entrees: calamari, sea scallops, chicken, and hibachi steak. The portions were generous, and all were properly cooked, fresh, and delicious. The waiter was attentive and kept the refills coming, without anyone having to ask. The teppan chef cooked & presented tasty, perfectly cooked food! The restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere, and enjoyable decor. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just had the best Tappen experience. Bought a half off on living social and arrived at 7:15 pm sat right away great initial service  Tappen chef was great very skilled and food tasted great. Can't beat this place. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi!!! Shrimp tempura is awesome. Try their specialty rolls. We almost passed up spicy chicken lettuce wraps because we thought \" we don't need an appetizer\". They were better than Pei Wei!!  Next visit, coconut shrimp! Our server was Ashley and she was terrific! A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Ate here during their \"Power Hour\" which is at 5pm (and 8pm) for 1/2 price Teppanyaki. For our first time trying this place out I was pretty impressed.  The service was very attentive with refills and taking our orders.  Timing was great on appetizers and food (with the exception that our salad and soup practically came out at the same time, but no big deal).  The Teppanyaki Chef was funny and very personable.   What I liked about this place was the sushi was delicious and the food wasn't over salted or over-buttered.  Certainly as good as Benihana, if not better.  Worth the price (even if you're paying full price).  We will come back."}
{"text":"It's an amazing place!! I like it.  Fue nuestra primera vez allí y me gusto todo,  el lugar,  el ambiente muy romántico y elegante,  y la comida fue lo mejor,  es sabor todo estaba delicioso, también la la atención siempre fueron muy cordiales y sonrientes.  ¿Que si volvería? Claro que si!!!  :)"}
{"text":"My go-to lunch place. Friendly, helpful staff. Large variety of specialty rolls (that are half price on Mondays under their current daily specials). I'm especially excited that they've added Teppanyaki to the lunch menu. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Just love this place! The sushi is the best in the east valley and NOW they have teppan tables. The chef Hieu can really entertain both young and well....mature! Good is consistent and delish!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places around. They have daily specials as well as happy hour! There sushi tastes great and looks great. I also have never had a problem with any of the people serving me. The ambiance is very relaxing and the place is decorated very nicely, you could go dressed up or casual and not feel out of place. Their prices are fair, and their portions are big. I would definitely recommend them to family and friends."}
{"text":"Food was great. But my original  $11 tab and $5 cash tip turned into a $22 dollar tab a week after I went there. They originally did only charge me $11 on my card, but I went to look on my debit account today and now it is saying I was charged $22 instead."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, nice atmosphere, great food."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Rock Lobster since it was the Sushi Room.  Heather the Manager is amazing and treats all the customers so well.  She always remembers my wine choice and my husband's soda (he's a Ginger Beer guy!).   The service and food is always consistent, fresh and delivered to perfection.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  Heather and the team will take exceptional care of you."}
{"text":"Checking out the new Rock Lobster! Food and service was great - sea bass was amazing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. We love this restaurant, coming with our 3 kids, they also like the kid meals."}
{"text":"I tried this place out when it a few days after it opened and it only had two menu items. The man was apologetic about not having drink options. I ordered the lobster roll which came on a buttered and lightly fried slice of bread with chips and pickles. It was yummy but very small. For $9 I think it wasn't really worth a second go. I've heard that they have more options now but unless I'm in the area, I don't think I will be stopping by."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Fresh sushi! Exceptional service! Happy hour prices and options are great! Our new sushi spot. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi. I can't believe I've lived near this place for so long and haven't tried it until recently. Creative and delicious sushi rolls, both traditional and their own creations. Try the Poppin' or Tataki, excellent!"}
{"text":"Not really a review type person (I actually manage a restaurant in NYC, so I take reviews with a grain of salt) but I wanted to put my two cents in regarding Rock Lobster. I came in last Sunday night with my mother and her companion, who are both well into their eighties. There had been a misunderstanding and we arrived at 9:00pm thinking they closed at 10:00pm, only to find out that on Sunday they closed at 9:00, and in fact the chef had already walked out the door.  As my mind was reeling, wondering what my options in Queen Creek on a Sunday night would be, the manager (I assume) offered to let us stay and order as long as we restricted our selection to sushi/sashimi. This is actually what we had come for, so we were happy to comply. As I mentioned, I manage a restaurant in NYC, so I am all too well aware of the attitude from staff that can sometimes be directed towards guest who come in at closing time, on the contrary, our server (I didn't get the young ladies name) could not have been nicer and more accommodating. We were never made to feel rushed and the sushi was excellent. I am most appreciative for their hospitality and will definitely return (a little bit earlier) on my next trip to AZ."}
{"text":"Love this place. We've been there multiple occasions. Food is great. We love there happy hour specials, enjoy more yummies for less!"}
{"text":"Has changed names: Rock Lobster. I come here because the sushi is delicious and happy hour menu is good and prices are great! The last 3-4 times that I've been here I've had the same, slow as molasses waiter. Although he is very nice if he doesn't catch you giving him the stink eye odds are you'll be ignored/forgotten. They are under construction currently, becoming teppenaki...it's a small place so I wonder how successful it will be. I'll come back because my cravings take over my life."}
{"text":"Changing one's name does not change the fact that the establishment still exists. I've experienced the WORST service with \"The Sushi Room\" now Rock Lobster. I purchased a Groupon a few months back to eat sushi with my daughter and that is where the horrible service saga began.  Making reservations is an absolute joke! When I first purchased the Groupon, we made the reservation as required in the fine print. We arrived 15 mins early and sat outside. 15 mins later our drink orders were taken. Another 10, the drinks arrive and we order. We sat outside for 45 mins with NO food and no real service. The restaurant was NOT crowded! When I requested to cancel the order and pay for the drink I drank, I was told my food was almost ready. Not quite, I'm leaving! We were offered the food for free, but by this time I was quite upset because I was hungry and irritated. Stuck with the Groupon, I was forced to use it before it expired. Thanks for nothing Chase Bank!  Today, I had my mother call and make a reservation for 5:30 pm and she was told they only had a 5:45 pm open. Upon arrival at 5:35 pm we were told that we had no reservation. Hmmm. Really?! Why is this the same girl who provided no service the last visit? And why does the sign on the wall state that Teppan ressy's start at 5 pm? Could the night get any worse? Hmmm, let's see:  - With the addition of the Teppan, the waitress should ask whether or not a guest wants a regular or Teppan seat. Don't automatically walk me to a tray table (too small for 2 people). I made a reservation for the Teppan table that apparently NEVER made it to the book - You have happy hour, but I could only get HH drinks at the Teppanyaki table. Suggestion: Make a special \"Teppan HH Menu\". This might serve your business well - No real Vodka or decent beer options; at least not for me. Absolute Vodka and Bud Light are low budget. Step up your game - While it is restaurant week, I had to request the RW menu. No bueno - We were told we could sit anywhere at the Teppan table however, should more people arrive we'd have to move down. Great! Right when my a$$ has warmed the seat. Though Benihana's has gone downhill, this place could learn something. Seat people correctly the first time. I'M NOT GETTING UP ONCE I'M COMFORTABLE!  NOTE: I actually saw her ask a family with a disabled child to move once others arrived. Rude and unprofessional. The family was there first and shouldn't have been asked to move. If anything, the incoming family of six should've been sat at the Teppan table in the back.  - The waitress barely came to inquire if we were ok or if we needed anything. And being the nice person I am, still left a tip. Shame on me. - And last but not least, when I showed her the Groupon she went to touch my phone. (Excuse me! You're in my personal space and attempting to touch my personal property! No bueno!) I will mark the Groupon as redeemed. Don't ever touch a customer's phone.   BUYER BEWARE! NEW NAME SAME OWNERS (APPARENTLY) AND SAME WAITRESSES, WHICH IS HARD TO TELL WITHOUT THE CHANGE IN SERVER ATTIRE (FROM BOOTY SHORTS TO BLACK PANTS AND A BLACK UNIFORM T-SHIRT)....THE ONLY THING THIS PLACE DID RIGHT. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This place can suck it. First off they don't ask you if you want teppan they just sit you down. Second they don't tell you you cant order from half the menu unless you're sitting at a grill. Third the food that the kitchen prepares isn't great.   My BIGGEST complaint is that the service was horrible. The waiter took a long time to take drink orders and than didn't show back up with them until after we ordered food. We had to ask another server to refill our water/sodas and busboys delivered the food. We actually didn't see our waiter until it was time for me to wave him down and ask for the bill. No one asked how anything was (food, service etc). It was a waste of money. Next time i'll just go to Bennihana(?)."}
{"text":"Went to try this place out on a Sunday night. I had found a Groupon for $16 for $30 worth, even without this the place has a ton of specials on different days.  Went in about 6pm, the place was kind of empty and we were seated right away. The Miso soup was good but nothing special. I ordered the Orange Chicken and my GF ordered the Samurai Roll. My Orange Chicken was exellent with veggies and pineapple and Rice. Altough I would prefer if they gave a little more rice with it, since I was still kind of hungry after. My GF really liked her Samurai Roll. For desert we had some Apple Tempura with caramel and sugar drapped over it. This was really good as well  Overall it was a good experience and we will be coming back to here in the future"}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars at Rocklobster. We go every Friday for Happy hour.  We have invited a few of our friends and they also like this place.  This is our hangout on friday nights.  Great atmosphere, awesome service and Outstanding food.  We always look forward to our Fridays out.. Bret is the best.  Never go without having my glass filled with shock top. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I have been here dozens of times even since back in the day when it was The Sushi Room. We have elected to not go back because it is going down hill.    #1- It has become filthy. The floor has had food on it the last few times I went and the tables have been sticky.   #2- The description of the food is right on the menu and the last few times they've been wrong. If the sushi man doesn't know what to put on a roll all he has to do is look at the menu!  #3- The service I agree with other Yelpers is not very good. The wait staff seems to disappear.   My main problem is the dirtiness. I cannot do it anymore. Hopefully they will clean up and I will think about going back. I meant to email the business directly but though y'all should know too.    The food is great when it is correctly made."}
{"text":"I love coming here for a quick lunch or bringing friends/family when visiting! Service almost always great and food too! You can get a half-price anything Teppan-Yaki on the early bird special with reservations at 5 PM:) that's a great deal!"}
{"text":"The sushi was flavorful and expertly prepared. There were rolls I've never seen before. My family and I enjoyed Rock Lobster greatly. It was a little pricy but it was worth it."}
{"text":"This place rocks! My workplace ordered some catering it was gr8! I will go check it out with my wife soon! A+"}
{"text":"Well what a turn around... The Sushi Room pissed me off so bad by forgetting my order, not sure how that happens, I cringed seeing a new name with prolly same results Went Saturday night with my wife for Happy hour Wow what a great experience Food was excellent seaweed salad, squid salad,sashimi and the cowboy rolls. Service was spot on! Atmosphere was nice Server Chris very nice and helpful with our questions. I'm happy to know RL is doing well! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Edemame, chicken rolls, Poppin roll, sunshine roll and california roll.  Beautifully made, service was excellent."}
{"text":"Sushi is very fresh. I have been here several times for lunch and also dinner when it was the Sushi Room. If you get to sit at the bar you get great service. However sit outside on a nice day and you're lucky if you get water. They have now added a teppan table which may bring a more clientele not just into sushi. Service needs to get better the girls are cute, just not servers."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh the rolls here are so amazing! Strawberry butter fish and the poppin hands down the best!!! Service is great but slow. Drinks are poured great! We love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has by far the best sushi we've ever had.  Great specials on Sunday and Monday and the service is also great.  Chris gets a special mention as he is always on top of everything!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE that we found this place! We have been searching for our sushi spot because we had the best place back in Utah! I have yet to find a place that even compares to our go to in Utah, until now! The restaurant is really cool and trendy. The food is amazing! I am kind of a sushi snob and was super impressed by their selection. I look for sushi that holds flavor all on it's own without having to use soy sauce, wasabi or ginger and they mastered that. I also am very big on presentation and the quality of the roll itself and they nailed it here too! Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Went here last night. They have a deal, if you make a reservation for the  5:00 teppanyaki, all the teppanyaki meals are half price (YES ALL OF THEM!!!) So of course I got the $48 combination. It starts out with a soup (not miso) so if you're expecting it, don't.(they do have miso which I would order instead).  Then you get a nice chilled salad with ginger dressing. You can orderfried rice for extra or get the white rice   So now the main course. Appatizer shrimp, large lobster tail, filet mignon, scallops and mixed veggies. It was amazing. All for $24. I can't believe it. I know your asking yourself, how is the quality.... great!!!  I would deffinetly be back.   What a Dimond in the rough. Check it out."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've come here and have had a terrible experience. I typically buy a groupon and it's for 30 dollars and they always try to make up their own rules saying you can't use it on certain things. When bringing it to management attention the young girls working there were laughing and talking crap about the customers. Very unprofessional and we won't be back. I recommend going to kona where you can get good sushi and professional service."}
{"text":"Love this sushi, excellent traditional sushi/sashimi as well as from good American style sushi for those who don't like raw fish, if that is you I suggest the chimichanga roll."}
{"text":"Great sushi, and it was very fresh fish. Ben did a great job, and the price was fair. I'm a sushi snob that has been constantly let down by other \"sushi\" restarants in the southwest, but i was impressed here and will be coming back. I was looking at some of the other reviews that mention cleanliness, I didn't see any issues, it looked clean to me and I sit at the bar to look at the fish they use."}
{"text":"Service was top notch, music was great, sushi was even better. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Yum-my!!  Our server was great-recommended things he thought WE would like, not just stuff they were pushing - I listened to him!!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious dinner tonight with some of the best innovative rolls. One of our favorites was the butterfish and strawberry roll. We also loved the KIG super-spicy roll. The servers were so nice and efficient."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!  A must venue. Special thanks to Heather and Bret! Mia and uno y dos.."}
{"text":"Great Staff, Great Sushi!  The Yummy roll is as fresh and tasty as it gets.  S/O to Chris, Dan, John and Heather.  Oh, and did I mention a great Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and has great flavor. Atmosphere is up beat and chic. Staff always friendly."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service is the worst. You have to asked about 3 times for something to actually get it. Server last night came 3 times to our table- to take our order, serve us our food, and give us our check. Had to ask another server for the right order and to refill our drinks."}
{"text":"We came in for teppanyaki on a Saturday night and there was no wait, not usually a good sign. Service was great but the food not so much. The soup was terrible and tasted like it had dehydrated mushrooms rather than fresh. The sauces that come with your meal were awesome but they come in handy since most of the food was very bland. Recommend for happy hour or sushi but not full priced dinner."}
{"text":"The sushi here is very fresh. There are many unique rolls as well as the traditional rolls. Some of our favorites are the Summer Roll and Dragon.  They have specials on different nights. There is both indoors and outdoor seating. The staff here is friendly and very professional.  This is our number one sushi place! Mary G"}
{"text":"We LOVE Rock Lobster!  We tend to pick a sushi restaurant and stick with it.  After moving here almost four years ago we tried several both in Chandler and around the Valley and settled on Rock Lobster (then The Sushi Room).  The past six month have been a work in process with the addition of the teppanyaki and we were worried that the sushi may take a back seat.  Thankfully that is not the case.  We've had both the teppanyaki and the sushi in the past month... and most months since they started and can honestly say that Rock Lobster is outdoing themselves!  Spectacular salmon nigiri.  When the toro is fresh it is FRESH!  KIG and shrimp tempura are our other faves.  Service is second to none.  Heather, Chris, Collin and everyone else always treats us like we're the most important guest they have.  Perfect for a celebration, date night or just lunch!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Sundays are great with their all day happy hour! Lots of rolls to choose from and have all been great. I have not tried the teppanyaki yet, but will will one day!"}
{"text":"The Poppin rolls were AWESOME! This place is way better than The Sushi Room, I think it is re-invented, but, they did it....so much better.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had another wonderful Girls night out at one of my favorite places in Chandler.  Our waiter, Colin, was extremely nice and gave us some great menu suggestions-- all were fabulous!  The food is great but the staff is what makes it a great place to simply relax, eat great food and have an enjoyable night. Thanks Colin!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was horrible.  Waitress kept forgetting little things.  Need lemons?  Better ask three times and wait 15 minutes.  Fork?  Yep... Ten minutes while your food cools off.  We were not the only people either,  saw other tables tracking down their waitress too trying pay their bill so they could leave... Service was bad bad bad.  Heather - you should get a different job in another industry,  bit then that industry would suck ass too,  best you stay where you are... At least I know not to eat there anymore."}
{"text":"Upon further review the call is overturned to 5 stars! Thanks guy's! Like I said great atmosphere, great food , really cool employees.."}
{"text":"I was craving sushi one day and we don't have a sushi spot we go to in town so we looked on Yelp. We had some other errands to run that night so we decided to come here because of the specials and it was so close to our house. We ordered our drinks and filled out the sushi menu, it took forever for our server to pick up our order, we watched him bounce around at the tables near us. Once our order was finally taken it took about 30 minutes for them to bring our rolls out, I've never waited that long. Then to add on top of waiting so long they didn't put in the order for one of the rolls. So we finished what we had and waiting an addition 20 minutes for one sushi roll that they didn't put the order in on. We were at the restaurant for 2 hours! We finally just got the check since the roll was still not out. I never got my sushi roll. I'm not really pleased with how they list their specials, it should be more specific. I'm overall disappointed in the service we received"}
{"text":"I really like it here! Area is really nice and the decor of the place is really cute too. Sushi is super good, and there is a wide variety of it, not just the basics. Also they have happy hour everyday, and you can get $5 sushi rolls during it! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Five stars for my man Jose! Best hibachi chef ever! Hibachi is an entertaining show in itself, but Jose made it even better. You can't help but smile and his laugh is contagious. He was great!! The food was delicious! And the staff was attentive and very polite. I was in town for work and will definitely come back when I'm in town again!"}
{"text":"Tried it out last night since they added the Teppanaki tables. We had a 630 pm reservation and had to wait 15 mins for the grill to be reset. Then, after being seated, the waitress had a lot of problem getting our orders taken. Once our sushi arrived, we had no wasbi, ginger or soy dishes and had to ask a couple times to get them. The chef cooking on the grill was wonderful and our food was great (except I had to choose a more expensive option due to a dairy allergy). When we were getting our meat, we had to ask 3 times to get the steamed rice. Just seemed like we were always waiting and the waitress was completely overwhelmed. Would have loved even a little compensation for our inconvenience or at least an I'm sorry. For the price, I would choose Benihana if given the choice. JMO"}
{"text":"This place is great went here on my way home and had a great dinner! Heather was my server she did a great job making suggestions! Can't wait to come back here it was all so fresh!"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour specials and the firestone walker IPA on draft.  This place has really cool patio seating as well!"}
{"text":"NOT EVEN 9:15 PM AND THEY CLOSED THE KITCHEN!!!! What the hell else do they have going on in a Thursday night. So much for having hours open until 10PM.   And while I am at it...Rock Lobster is a band in AZ and should sue this establishment over naming rights.   Next time feed the starving customers...I would have dropped $100-150 easily tonight.   Off to find real Sushi...Blue Wasabi perhaps!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices.  Love their food.  The teppanyaki tables are always empty and just take up too much room in this small dining room.  I have been here 20 plus times.  The service is almost always good but there are a few wait staff that could do a better job."}
{"text":"Just came back from eating here and I can honestly say that the rainbow roll was one of the best I ever had.  The service was very good as well.  This place is situated in a nice location where you can have your pick of a few nice restaurants.  Rock Lobster (fka The Sushi Room) is one of them.  Bf was with me and had the salmon.  By the look of his clean plate, he must have liked it.  Bf then ordered the chocolate lava cake, and although very rich tasting, bf didn't feel too heavy afterwards -- a definite plus for him and me!!:)"}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers. The Teppan was amazing - loved the food - that's why I even give this restaurant 2-stars. The service was atrocious. I was attending a birthday dinner with a large party which would not all fit into one Teppan table, so they put the overflow (3 people) into the adjoining Teppan table. Halfway through the meal they decided that they wanted to give that table to a bigger party so asked us (the overflow) to move to another, smaller table. Fine - we did that so we didn't look like jerks. But then they didn't like where I put my baby's car seat so asked me to move it out of the way. By then, I was getting a little irritated.   But back to the service. The waitress was MIA the entire meal. Never took a drink order. Never received the sushi menu I asked for, had to go hunt one down myself. Then had to hunt down a pencil to mark the menu with. Never had a water refill. The only time I saw her was to give me my check. Then she has the audacity to add automatic gratuity onto my check which, honestly, really ticked me off since I was not planning on rewarding this waitress with a 'large' tip based on the fact that I happened to be with a large party. I am accustomed to tipping 18%-20% for good service. I have no problem doing so. However, when I get bad service, I don't reward it. And I was really ticked that she added gratuity herself, whether it be restaurant policy or not, I did not like that -- at all.   Moreover, the restaurant is waaay too small for the amount of people and tables they're trying to cram into the small space. Everyone, including the servers were tripping over one another and after spending two hours there, I was totally over it and couldn't wait to get out. I will never go back, regardless of how yummy the Teppan was."}
{"text":"Second time here this week. Yummy! This place has really stepped it up. Great sushi! Great service! Collin, our waiter was awesome. He was friendly and our water glasses were never empty. That's a big deal for me. I hope I can keep myself away for a week."}
{"text":"Coming from Alaska we are used to great sushi...and this place had great sushi!! No complaints about the food or portion size. Plus if you come during happy hour they have great deals.. 5 star food. 3 star service. The waiter we had would check in as he was walking by..he never took the time to stand there and ask how it was. It seemed as though he was the only one working there which seems odd for a big Thursday night crowd."}
{"text":"Last Saturday my Girl Friend and I went out to try Rock Lobster. I ordered a noodle dish and she had a sushi roll. Service was fast. Food was good. However, Saturday night she came down with food sickness.   Not a good way to remember Rock Lobster. Too bad the food and ambiance was good."}
{"text":"Sushi in the desert is tough, I get that, so I am being generous. Cool ambiance, friendly staff and creative rolls are a plus. The quality of the fish is not very good though. I have not tried the tepenyaki so that may be better."}
{"text":"Excellent variety of maki, sashimi and sushi. Good texture and presentation. Delicious hot wasabi. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"At least the Starters and main dishes came out quickly.  However, and similar to folks sitting near us, server unfortunately forgot to bring ginger, etc., and then took an extended time to finally bring it."}
{"text":"The worst sushi ever! None of my group finished there meal and the service was awful. Tables on the patio were so tightly packed it was nearly impossible for someone to get out of there seat to use the restroom. High priced for what your receiving as far as service and quality of food. Strongly recommend any other sushi bar in the area before coming here."}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was better than it was when it was The Sushi Room. My wife and I used to go to the sushi room often. They changed the name because they added a teppanyaki table. Same owner though and pretty much the same menu."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the area. The Sushi Room has always been in my top choices when it comes to sushi and the addition of the Teppanyaki tables and the rebranding were a great upgrade.  The bbq short ribs were pretty good and the teppan was also really good. And fair prices which is always a plus.   I had the filet and it was well executed. The soup and salad were also excellent.   Friendly chef, professional staff, all in all a great experience.  The fried rice was above average.  My only suggestion is the music selection. I mean at 6 pm still a family time and listening Madonna's \"I touch myself\" is not what I appreciate when I go out with my kid. (at least the volume wasn't that loud and the lyrics got lost).  Just a disclaimer. Although there's room for improvement, being the first week as a teppan it really deserves the 5 stars and I'm sure in a couple of months they'll tune everything up to have a solid concept.  I'll be back for sure.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Love the food! Everything was so yummy and the atmosphere was amazing. Sat outside and enjoyed the sun and food. Happy hour prices are great for lunch. I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's not even 5 minutes from  my work. I get sushi for lunch at least once or twice a week and it's awesome! They have a large variety of specialty rolls and I've had all of them. They are all very good - If you are looking to try something new I would suggest the Strawberry Butterfish roll. It's light and refreshing! They also have one of the best shrimp tempura rolls I've ever had. There have been a few times that I called ahead and ordered and when I arrived the order wasn't ready and being in lunch break it took time away from being able to actually eat, also a few times I ordered the crab puffs there were very brown and over cooked.. those are the only reasons why I gave 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times. First time was excellent service. Seating everywhere is extremely comfortable. Waitress was very nice. Sushi was great and so were the drinks. We went there again this week and were seated. No one came up to us for ten minutes. And it was half as busy as the first time. Still a great place. However, we were very disappointed that we went for happy hour and nothing was discounted. They don't have a happy hour menu. They just say \"it's happy hour! So order everything you want before 6:30.\" We were ecstatic to hear that. Who doesn't want to save money? Well we get the check and come to find out, only one drink was on happy hour. The four rolls we got were full priced. The Saki was full price. So we ended up paying $30 for two saki orders for \"happy hour\" and $60 for 4 rolls. Apparently happy hour is selective. If only they had a print out of the menu so everyone knows what is and isn't discounted. Or at least have your staff let us know the food and drinks that will not be discounted. Also, we ordered an appetizer as well. But it came out with all of the rolls and drinks. That was slightly annoying. A starter is what people start with... that way they can enjoy that and their drinks before the rolls. Instead, every single thing came out at once. After finishing, we asked for the check and left. Spent much more money next door at la Sala Tequila Cantina! They took care of us and their drinks and food are made from scratch and are AMAZING. We are going there from now on!"}
{"text":"FYI...kids no longer eat free on Sunday.  They said it was \"getting out of control\". LOL."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time if you respect good service ! I'm In town from socal visiting my family that recently moved here and we were craving sushi ! To our luck there was a place with great reviews down the street. It's a Monday at around 1, so we fully expected anywhere we went to be low key. We walked into rock lobster with high hopes cause it was cutely decorated and looked very nice. Me, and my 2 brothers were ready to stuff our faces ! Unfortunately we were ignored as we stood by the sign that read \"wait to be seated\". At least 4 mins went by (in a fairly empty restaurant) before we were greeted with a \"be there in a minute\" from a man who didn't even look at us. Waited another few before a lady smiled and said \"he will be right there\" before he finally told us to have a seat at the table RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. Like you could have told us that immediately. Then he placed menus with a pen without saying a word. I immediately hopped on Yelp to find another nearby restaurant and we left. I will not give my money to people who don't deserve it. Skip rock lobster if you care about how you're treated while having lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Sushi bar was great , the wicked roll was delish. Hibatchi side looked yummy ! Everything was great besides are waiter being a little slow. Nice little place, not too big though !"}
{"text":"Very pricey and very mediocre sushi. Relentless loud electronica music was obnoxiously incongruent with the chill setting. Friendly and polite but disorganized wait staff. Groupon tempted me to try it, but I will never go back."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience of our lives!! We had reservations at 6:30pm for the sit down dinner at the grill. I called at 4:15 to see if we could come earlier. The person I talked to said yes! You can come at 5:45. We arrived at 5:45 and were told, no we have to seat you at 6:30 the person you spoke to earlier didn't change your reservations to the 5:45. We asked to be seated at a regular table and they put us outside in the cold. The manager tony came over to us and asked how we were doing and I said we are freezing and he then moved us inside to a 4 person table, we had 5 people in our party. My husband sat at the corner of the table. Mine and my husbands beers came and we all started talking about the weird clear thing at the bottom of my husbands beer glass. We all thought it might be ice but end all be all, it was a piece of glass!! Our kids food came before mine and my husbands and they all finished their food and mine and my husbands still wasn't ready. I went to a waitress and asked for mine and my husbands to go and she told me that it was going to be another 20-30 min before our dinner was ready. I told her to cancel the order and that I just wanted to get the fuck out of the rock lobster in Arizona. The kids got their meals for free only because there was a piece of glass in my husbands glass. The manager Tony was such an asshole and had such horrible breath. He Made us feel like we were in the wrong. My husband and kids and I were so upset and confused by this experience. We are on vacation from sant Barbara, ca. And this is our last day and this experience totally ruined our last day!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi! We used to go the old sushi place that was there, and they had good food too.  Service was a little slow getting back to our table as it was busy.  They might need an extra server or two on Fri & Sat nights.   The selection of the rolls is pretty good.  Try the Las Vegas roll, worth it every time!"}
{"text":"Huge letdown!  Had high hopes for Rock Lobster, the former Sushi Room in Chandler.  We are Teppan fans but not really Sushi fans.  However, we do enjoy fried tempura which we usually eat at Sushi bars, When we tried it when Sushi Room was new, the oil was not hot enough so the tempura was limp and greasy with doughy insides.  We tried it on a second occasion and it was the same.  When we peeled back the doughy inside, the shrimp was long but skinnier than pencil width.  We get great oven bake tempura at Costco that are mostly shrimp not mostly breading and they are never greasy or doughy so this is not rocket science.  I mention this as we have now returned to the renamed Sushi Room (\"Rock Lobster\") and have twice tried the tempura appetizer and it was again greasy, limp and doughy with a pencil thin piece of shrimp inside ( including the replacement \"better\" order that the bartender brought us).  Just cannot get it right . . .   The Teppan table experience was not much better.  The frozen/thawed lobster tail literally had NO flavor.  It wasn't fishy but literally was flavorless.  If I closed my eyes I could not have told you what the food was that was in my mouth.  My steak was ok but my husband's was over cooked and tough.   Our biggest complaints are that the Teppan food is chintzy.  The fried rice has minuscule minced carrots in it.  Literally the  dice is the size of a piece of minced garlic and there is hardly any of it.  No corn, peas or the other veggies every other restaurant puts in their Teppan fried rice.  A big disappointment.  The veggies were way over- cooked each time.  They only include zucchini sticks over cooked to almost mush, a huge overdone amount of sliced white onions and over cooked mushrooms.  The Teppan chef leaves them on the grill top until all of everyone's other food is cooked so you also do not get to enjoy it with the rest of your meal.    Where is the shredded cabbage, bean sprouts and sometimes even Enoki mushrooms that other Teppan restaurants include?  If you have not eaten Teppan out of the area (think Sapporo in Scottsdale or Ichiberi in Orange County) then you might conclude this is as good as it gets but if I had to eat Teppan again in Chandker, though not near AA's good as Sapporo, I would go to Beni Hanna at Chandler Mall.  The owners could fix this easily and for little cost.  Let's see if they do!    Let's see if they also fix the Teppan chef's unsanitary and dangerous habit of using the same cooking utensils on the raw chicken, seafood, meat and veggies."}
{"text":"Came here when it was \"the Sushi Room,\" came back almost a year later when it was reinvented as \"Rock Lobster.\" I wasn't a fan of my experience last time, but I really liked it now!   Location: the restaurant is really well decorated and pretty. Pretty trendy and romantic--my boyfriend and I came here for a nice dinner date. I like the open garage doors to the patio thing that they have going on, but on cold nights it can be a little drafty.   Service: It was... good? We were planning on getting teppanyaki but didn't need the whole \"show;\" they gave us a teppanyaki menu at our regular table so we assumed it was okay to just order. No, it turns out you have to be seated at the hibachi table to order that, which was fine. We switched waiters and the new guy was kind of brusque and abrupt when taking our orders. Didn't seem interested at all, and when we said we wanted white rice instead of fried rice, he'd say stuff like \"booooring\" in a non-joking way, kind of just deadpan. Okay? They also said they were waiting for another party who had a reservation at the hibachi table, and we ended up waiting around twenty minutes for a no-show. Still okay.  BUT! They made up for it in several ways. The hibachi chef was great, energetic, smiling. And even if our waiter's mood was kind of dour, he was attentive and always took away our plates when we were done or filled up our waters. ALSO at the end of the meal, they mysteriously took off A LOT of money from our bill. Like... 30% or something like that. It was awesome! We didn't really ask why, but it was great and we left our experience smiling.  Food: I give it five stars. It was awesome. The teppanyaki steak and chicken were sooo tender and flavorful. Even typing about it is making my mouth water. The fried rice was also insanely good! (We wound up getting it anyway instead of white rice and it was fantastic). I can't wait to come back and try their sushi again.  All in all, great experience. I'd come back again if I was feeling in the mood for a hip sort of romantic night. Out with Sushi Room, in with Rock Lobster!"}
{"text":"A group of 8 of us tried formerly known Sushi Room now that it is now known as Rock Lobster.    Previous 3 martini lunches racked up a bill into the hundreds of dollars because we kept ordering and being impressed with each choice.    I can't tell if anything is new other than the name on the awning.  The menu is the same, the decor is the same even my credit card was billed under the Sushi Room.  What was new was incredibly slow service and mediocre food.  It started with my soup being room temperature but the guys next to has cups too hot to hold and billowing steam.  Many of us ordered the lunch special with a few custom rolls thrown in.  We certainly didn't expect everything to come out at once but it was so slow that almost everyone was finished and itching to pay so they could get back to work before I got my food.    I didn't say much on our drive back to the office as the car was filled with chatter about  never making a mistake of going there again."}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon, the raw sushi and rolls we had were fresh and awesome!!  The service was on time and friendly!  If you have not tried \"fresh wasabi\" (not the paste you usually get) then ask for the fresh wasabi, it is unbelievable!!  Highly recommend this place, prices are good, happy hour is pretty darn cheap food and drink wise!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some sushi, we had a Groupon, and have not been at this place since it was The Sushi Room.  The decor is still decent, always love to see the big round Chinese lanterns as lighting, and the patio is pretty much the same as before. I did notice their teppanyaki table area has taken a large portion of the indoor seating area. In regards to some comments mentioned about the cleanliness of the restaurant, we did see several pieces of glass on the floor, but as soon as our waiter noticed we were looking down a few times, he asked what we looking at...& promptly swept all around us. He mentioned they had a pretty big party previously and apologized several times for missing the glass.  We only had sushi today, the shrimp tempura maki roll, the Tataki specialty roll, a crunch roll and a few years pieces of Nigiri. We both liked the Tataki roll, and the other rolls were good, but nothing to throw a hoopla over.  Would we dine here again, maybe... The location is not near our house, but If someone invited me for dinner, I would go. We do have our favorite places a little closer to home."}
{"text":"First time there...  Food was good, service was awesome...  reasonably priced.  The teppanyaki chef put on a great show..  we'll be back for sure.."}
{"text":"Service was great ! Happy hour had some great options. We tried rolls that were not on HH. Our favorite were the KIA and Surf and Turf! The place is fun and seems to offer different options for dinner. They also have a Groupon."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. The staff was very friendly. The location was easy to find. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The sushi rolls tasted fresh and great. We ordered crunch and Vegas rolls with a glass of Malbec on the side. The patio is spacious and has a calm atmosphere. Good place to go on a date with someone. My only complaint is the service. On Valentine's there was very little staff and our server outside was also bartending inside. This meant our food came out almost at the same time as our drinks. I tried asking a hostess who walked by where our drinks were and she passed on by. Felt invisible in the corner of the patio."}
{"text":"Very disappointing sushi. The fish did not taste fresh, it had been previously frozen. Was really hoping to find a good quality sushi restaurant but this is not the place. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent teppanyaki. Would definitely come back again. A fun dining experience"}
{"text":"The whole family went here, showing the kids the teppan cooking. We order the strawberry butterfish roll and the san tan yellowtail roll, both looked nice and tatsed very good. My daughter had the grilled salmon which had nice presentation and cooked very well. I ordered the sea bass for the teppan and enjoyed it as well. The chef was great, even though we had to deal with a real jerk at our table who kept on trying to pester the chefs with silly questions and request. The chef remained professional although the customer was rude and appeared intoxicated. That guest almost ruined our time, and made it uncomfortable for the children.  He left before we were done, so we had some time with the chef which turned things around. Great job, Jeffrey! We would like to come back, but need to make sure we arent seated with anyone like that again."}
{"text":"I just wanted to write an update! We did accept the manager Heather's offer to come back and try Rock Lobster again. They have a hostess now! They also got all new glasses and I hear they are about to try out a new menu. They had the spicy-sweet martini I crave with sushi available this time and it was perfect! The glass was even clean! They have so many jalapeño-cream cheese varieties to choose from and those are our favorite! They were delicious and we didn't wait too long for them to come out! The visit was definitely 5 stars, but I'm going to have to go when the manager isn't the one waiting on us to make sure it's 5 star worthy for my fellow reviewers. We will be back! Thanks again Heather!"}
{"text":"Got the poppin roll,  butter fish strawberry roll, and an order of Nigiri spicy scallops. Loaded with flavor and was delivered with excellent presentation. Indoor decor of restaurant is modern Asian and very trendy. Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Didn't even get seated. Was told there was no seating for 3 available at the bar (at least 5 seats in a row open) nor indoors. Not anxious to eat sushi outside in 92F heat, so we left."}
{"text":"Has a great variety of rolls. We had the Tataki, Sunshine, and the Ultimate Shrimp Tempura rolls. The Ultimate Shrimp Tempura roll was the best out of the three. The delivery of the rolls was a little slow."}
{"text":"Great changes! You can still get the same delicious sushi but now you have the option to indulge in teppan too! The prices are still reasonable and the service is still friendly, accurate, and accomodating!"}
{"text":"I have come for sushi lunch for several years and have always had good food and really good service (Heather).  However, this place has fallen completely apart for the dinner I had this evening.  All the good goes out the window and I will NEVER be back.  Not to mention the prices are out of control high for what you get.  A cost rating of $$!  give me a break!  My wife's seabass was $35 and my chicken/shrimp was $30!  I'll spend a lot when it is worth it but this was a joke.   We got an early reservation for 4 (wife and 2 kids under 8) and were rewarded with a teppanyaki spot that was literally 4 feet from the front door.  The entire time we were there I had people standing against my chair - if felt like i had people leaning over my shoulder as I ate.  Also, the door was gushing in cold air (it was a rather cold evening for AZ).  I know the weather is not their fault but that does not excuse them from have a table that is so ridiculously close to the door.  Several times I had to turn around and tell the host to not stand there with the door wide open as she chatted with customers oblivious to the issue ( I actually think she may have been doing it on purpose).     The server was obviously way more interested in taking care of the group we shared the teppanyaki table with as she repeatedly tended to their needs without even turning her head our direction.  The other group was even laughing at how obnoxious it was.  Then the chef came out and he was awful.  Im sure he was doing his best but what a joke.  I expect the over done tricks of the flaming onion volcano and the dumb train whistle but he had no game at all (he didn't even cut and devein the shrimp).  He couldn't time any of the meal so we got our rice 15 minutes before our meat and then waited another 10 for vegetables.   I literally had to eat my meal like a 5 year old going from one item to the next as it was served.  All while the cold air from the front door was rapidly cooling my food to a refrigerator temp.  It was like eating left-overs.  Completely over cooked chicken and shrimp was only topped off by his complete destruction of a delicate piece of $35 sea bass my wife ordered.  All the food was like rubber!      When I expressed my issues to a manager his reaction was polite and appeared to be genuinely concerned but his \"fix\" was a $25 gift certificate!  Are you kidding me?  \"Im sorry your $150 meal with your wife and kids was a disaster but I am not going to do anything about it...but when you come back we will knock off a few bucks (not enough to even pay for a single meal).  What a total and complete failure in customer service.  This review is only touching on the bigger issues and I could make this already long review even longer with several other examples but what is the point.  Anyone want a gift card?  I wont be using the one he gave me.  I should have just given it to someone at the table next to us."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi.... especially on happy hour!  The food is always impeccable and the service is always top notch.  I would recommend this restaurant 100% of the time, which is saying a lot for a sushi restaurant- as it's a more difficult type of restaurant to recommend."}
{"text":"Expected good food and service based on what I read. They must have had a bad day or something.  Tempura was okay. But the rest not so good.  I sent two dishes back full and no one came to talk to me.  The need dish had 7-10 carrots stuck together and was way overdressed.  And the shrimp role had nori that was inedible.  Also note that Groupon and happy hour cannot be mixed.  Was offered a repeat visit so we went.  Manager who offers is gone, seems like a lot of turn over.  I did hope that this time there would actually be a sushi chef but nope.  We went as a family this time, $50 buys a couple of beers and three meals.  Son tried wings, they were not properly dressed half was missing sauce, my tempura roll was bland and kind of soggy, not sure if they were supposed to add wasabi but it was gross.  My husband had his spicy tuna roll and it looked all different sizes.  Weird.  (See pics).  Finally the edamame was soggy and defiantly not fresh.  Not a fan and will drive by next time."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but after today I will not got back. We went for happy hour and the menu and the waitress were VERY misleading for the price of the nigiri. The menu lists nigiri as a price for 2 pieces. Then the happy hour says $2.50. Apparently it's $2.50 per piece of nigiri so you should order a 1/2 order apparently. This even though it's listed as a happy hour \"deal\" is 25 cents cheaper then normal. I'm not a fan when places and their staff mislead you. This place has definitely gone downhill over the years. Sushi is average. Nothing to right home about. I'd look elsewhere if I were you. There's plenty of better, cheaper places in the valley to go to."}
{"text":"1/2 off roll mondays are so worth it! We came here for lunch and ordered three rolls. I've forgotten the names now but they were all delicious and slightly spicy.  Service was attentive. Rock lobster has more of a bar feel and probably gets really loud and \"club\" like at night. We did want to try the teppenyaki but they said that doesn't start until after 5 pm.  For $20 and fresh sushi, we really enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"Went there the other night we had great service beautiful atmosphere the sushi was good will go back another time for our Groupon, happy hour prices are good as well...."}
{"text":"Really friendly and comfortable atmosphere.  Good, fresh, creative sushi offerings.  Great promotions and happy hour prices.  Teppanyaki  is also good.  Most of all, staff is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Solid food.  Very nice staff.  Prices were good.  They have some great looking happy hour deals. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great food. Sushi really good and teppanyaki food was also great. Chef was a lot of fun"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place EVER! They have the best happy hour and daily specials! And they recently added teppan to their place when they transitioned from The Sushi Room to Rock Lobster. Definitely recommend if you want great sushi for a great price!"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim on a Thursday night. We assumed it was going to be busy and made a reservation through OpenTable.   When we got there the hostess said they don't check for reservations on the weekdays, which was off putting to say the least.   Regardless, the food was alright. Compared to a Japanese restaurant I would say it was subpar. The overall experience was lacking, while the waitress was attentive in refilling our drinks the food came out 10 minuets after another and we ordered 5 items so there was a lot of waiting involved.   I don't think I would return as this place was not for us. I believe this was more of a hangout than an eatery."}
{"text":"We have been to Rock Lobster twice and the waitress' have been wonderful and the food is always great."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times for lunch. One day I asked if I could get the spicy tuna bowl not spicy and the waiter said yes. Although I got the sushi lunch, the next time I came in I ordered the spicy tuna bowl but asked for it not to be spicy. The waitress said that's not possible. No big deal, but misinformation is kind of a nuisance. Here's why I gave them two stars. Each time I've come during lunch during the week, I was there for nearly 2 hours. The wait is unbelievably long. I don't come with a lot of people, just 2 others usually. So if you are looking for a quick spot for lunch, skip this place and head over to Sauce."}
{"text":"Service was great but by far the worst rolls I've ever had. I couldn't even finish them. Dull and lacking flavor. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"When it comes to restaurants, my particular hobby is finding places which I can bring my dog and enjoy a meal.  When I called to check if my puppy was welcome, the lady who answered not only welcomed but stated \"Do you object to the waitstaff offering her treats?\"  Now that is how you take a paying customer's money!  When I arrived, they had a nice table on the patio designated.  I recognize as part of the dog/patio culture that you must take a special place to accommodate customers, yet we dined in a nice place vs. undesirable.  Even more touching, they had a light plate of \"dog friendly\" sushi for my little friend.  It was a welcome experience, and I was sure to tip extra as the waitress made a great experience.    The human factor of course was wonderful as the sushi was on-par.  Yet it tickled me as they allowed my Russell Terrier to experience sushi.  This place is devoted to making their patrons happy, which is why I still demand my clients in the Chandler area experience Rock Lobster.  That ounce of kindness they gave myself and my dog made me realize this place truly loves the client/vendor relationship.  Anyone can make great sushi, yet this place enhances that factor with making their customers happy."}
{"text":"Always a great sushi experience with the gang at Rock Lobster! Thanks Heather, Gustavo, Sada and Felix for a fun evening last night! The Poppin, Surfer and Shrimp rolls were beautiful and delicious! Gustavo, you out did yourself with the Salmon salad...loved it and thank you!"}
{"text":"Did the Tappan and was excellent. More than enough food and service was great. Groupon makes this an absolute must! Parking is the only bummer at this location"}
{"text":"The service was a 5 top-notch, the owner or manager was heavily involved with ordertaking, checking in on you and expediting the service. I had two different rolls, the first came out very quickly and the rice was still pretty warm. At first I thought it was the soy sauce bottle that maybe had been outside, but then I realized when I put my finger on it that the rice hadn't completely cooled, which Ive never experienced at a sushi place before. The Poppin roll was good but one you'd want to share. Overall, I would go back and try a few different things."}
{"text":"Meh, that's all I can say...meh, average, whatev, so-so.  The ambience and vibe is cool, the scenery is modern, but the overall seating and dining room is a little weird, sort of not feng-shui. But that's not that big deal, for me the big deal was having MEH food.  The calamari (they call it Fried IKA here) was weak, it was pretty dry and you could still taste some of the flour on it, it wasn't crisp and sharp, just dry and flat. I really did not dig the calamari, and the veggie tempura was the same...flat, willowy, and just not done well by tempura standards. The sashimi and nigiri were fine, but then again it's kind of hard to screw up a piece of raw fish, just..slice it and serve it.  The dishes and appetizers were just not inspiring or special, they were average and certainly not worth their price...this place is pricey for average to boring food.  It's OK...I personally wouldn't come back just because the food wasn't exciting or very memorable, I could barely remember what I ate when I woke up the next day, it was just not memorable or noteworthy.  Mikado is right down the street and they do the best tempura anywhere, seriously...I've had tempura at every sushi joint in the area, and Mikado wins every time. But if you want to try out rock lobster, go ahead, at least check it off your list of places you've been."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because my friends love it. I'd never had teppanyaki before, and I'm not huge on sushi, so it was going to be an interesting time--it was definitely a show! That and being there with friends were the only highlights, though.  Going in I knew the price point, which struck me as pretty typical for teppan, but the mushroom soup that was provided was more salty than anything else. The salad was fresh enough, though the dressing wasn't my favorite, but the meat wasn't very good quality at all. It wasn't the worst I've ever had--it was tender and cooked decently, but even after the chef seasoned it, it didn't have much flavor at all, and the fried rice had almost no veggies in it. I split an entree, but even if I hadn't, the portions were really small. If I'm honest, I could have paid less and gotten better-quality meat at Gen in Tempe.  Obviously something like teppanyaki has to have a bit of a show with it, with banter and stuff with the chef, but making a racist remark to my boyfriend doesn't exactly qualify as humor, especially when it's at his expense. We were both pretty ready to go when that happened. I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"We love Rock lobster, formally known as the sushi room. Heather is amazing! They give good portions of fish and I love the drinks!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this place is very nice. The bathrooms were very clean and modern. However, for a place that had about 5-6 occupied tables and plenty of chefs and servers the wait was ridiculous! We had 5 people at our table and 3 different sushi menus for the three separate bills we would have and I didn't like not only waiting for our sushi for over 45 minutes to an hour but to get our sushi for the whole table on one plate then having to guess who had what food, just was not appealing. And the one person who did not order sushi got his food within ten minutes. Not a place we will be visiting again."}
{"text":"This used to be The Sushi Room but now they've added teppanyaki and changed their name.   I've been here quite a few times but only had the sushi.    The sushi is very good and fresh, high quality with good variety. My only complaint is that the pieces are a little small and still priced high.   The waitstaff is great. Very friendly.   This place get packed on Friday and Saturday nights so expect you might have a wait for your table and food. Inside and outside seating.  Can be loud near bar and teppanyaki tables."}
{"text":"Love this place. Unique and creative rolls, with many different flavor profiles. The best is the Poppin roll, only $7 on happy hr. Awesome specials almost everyday, plus all day happy hour on Sundays w/ live music. $4-6 HH apps and $5-8 HH rolls. Indoor and outdoor seating, with Teppanyaki for large and small groups. Fried Ice Cream is also pretty good. Strongly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Rock Lobster was DELICIOUS! My daughter picked Rock Lobster to celebrate her 21st birthday. The food was delicious the drinks were amazing the service was impeccable and we've decided to make this our celebratory restaurant. I truly can't say enough positive comments about Rock lobster."}
{"text":"Sushi was great. Used a Groupon and ended up spending almost triple because of how yummy everything was. Server was great and even gave us the AMAZING apple desert on the house just because we put an offer on a house that day. Definitely memorable and special. Also, for the record, the sushi chefs seemed SO relaxed and happy (different than most places around the Valley). :)"}
{"text":"Truly the worst teppanyaki i have ever had. Super salty and poorly cooked. Burned & sloppily served. I gave them 3 trys. Im done."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal!  Had the Teppan & Sushi to celebrate a birthday, and it was a wonderful  experience.  Definitely going back for sushi!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff. Great rolls. Comfortable atmosphere. Live music on Sunday afternoons. Generous happy hour. All good!!"}
{"text":"The best sushi I have had in a long time! I always have great service here! Every time I bring a new friend here they love it. I come here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Yuck! Specialty rolls were definitely nothing special. Tasted like a packaged California roll you buy in a grocery store. The $9 short ribs were cold and super salty. When I told the waiter all he said was \"sorry\" and walked off. Maybe the Teppanyaki is better but if you want sushi or hand rolls drive east 10 minutes to Otaku!"}
{"text":"Not quite a fan. While they do have an enticing (but small) menu I haven't been completely sold.  I'm not a fan of spicy fish or mayo so there's not a whole lot on the menu for me personally."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Have been here multiple times and the sushi is fantastic.   They also have really good happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Poppin Roll and Dragon Roll were delish. Very fresh and flavorful! Excellent service. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"Waited for a waiter for more than 30 mins to order our drinks once we was  seated by the hostess. The restaurant was only a 3rd full.. Very sloooow service! A big disappointment tonight. Came for the DATE NIGHT dinner... Was told that there was not room for us and would have to wait to see if we could try to fit in with the next group. Next group was only 2 people they acted as they were expecting a big dinner rush for next seating and it may not be possible to fit in. Had a $199 bill with 20% tip.. Not worth the price.  However... Our waiter tried hard to do a good job! Try Kobe's Steakhouse if in the area.. Much better service and price!!!#####"}
{"text":"I was very impressed! The tuna tataki sashi was delicious!!! We ordered several rolls including the cowboy roll on happy hour and none of them cost more than $8...the sushi was fresh the service was great and it was very reasonably priced! I've definitely found my new favorite sushi/Japanese restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Happy hour prices 3-6:30 pm daily with $5 cocktails and half price on most of the food. The appetizer dumplings (Gyozas) are some of the best I have had. Also tried the Poppin, Toro Nigiri and butterfish Nigiri and loved them all and have been back 3 times just to get more. The Toro just melted in your mouth is was so good. Must have the fresh wasabi with it all. Ashley and Collin make great drinks, we had Whiskey sour and Rock Rita, would get both again. Great sushi with a nice atmosphere, can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! (hence the name). I love the blazing thunder speciality roll and the fillet on the  Teppanyaki. I'm not much of a foodie- I'm a mans MAN! I usually just opt for ramen noodles or chili from a can, but I came here with my beautiful girlfriend on a date and it was everything we expected, and more! Service was especially quick, friendly and funny."}
{"text":"For New Years Eve we invited 4 friends with us to your establishment.  We go there quite frequently and have never had a bad experience.  We tipped the teppanyaki chef $25.  He asked our guests if he could cut off some of their food and give it to the other people that we did not know sitting at the table that were not a part of our party.  As we received our bill they added a 20% gratuity to iron top of what we had already paid.  We asked to speak to a manager.  He said that they add that on to people who use groupons if we didn't want to tip that much he would ask the chef to give us our money back.  How embarrassing we couldn't do that.  We have been there so many times with and without groupons and large parties and us as well as our guests have always been able to eat what we ordered never had to share with people we didn't know and we have never had a tip added to our bill.  I am sending this in hopes that you will rectify the situation"}
{"text":"I live nearby is this new up and coming area and have driven by many times... Looking for something different I found a great deal on Groupon for this restaurant and boy am I happy... With or without a coupon, I will definitely be coming back.. The happy hour menu looks amazing and there are tons of specials you find out about during your visit."}
{"text":"Mr Miagi would approve !!  Daniel son loves me some sushi . Always fresh with real friendly staff . Great weekly specials will keep you coming back . I have seriously just considered setting up for auto pay here .....clean new environment come on down ."}
{"text":"Love the food. The mustard sauce was wonderful. The chef was great and not too cheesy. I hate it when they over-do the \"play with food\" time. Not the case here. Just focused on a great meal. I highly recommend the calamari."}
{"text":"awesome food but we brought in a groupon for $30 on entrees.. and ordered a few happy hour items to add to the ticket for alittle extra food, and when we went to pay they made all the happy hour items full price so our groupon covered our full priced entrée items but we had to pay full price for happy hour items!!! what a scam! we will not be going back there! Plenty of good sushi places in AZ! but to sneak things in to make a few $? shady if you ask me!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and specialty drinks.  Great Teppanayki meal. Had filet and lobster.  Amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"Had a great celebration dinner with friends that included kids.  I had chicken and steak with veggies, so tasty.  Enjoy the precursor of soup and salad that go with it.  The kids had a good time too, but I think next time I will not let my kids order chicken strips.  The prices were affordable!l"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I absolutely love this place. The sushi is fresh with unique sushi rolls. The device is relaxed and friendly. If you have had the peach sparkling sake, you're missing out. Not a little miss, but a big huge \"where can I find this!!\" miss. (FYI - Total Wine doesn't have it.) :-(  If you haven't been here yet and you're a sushi fan... You need to make a trip here. Absolutely delish!!"}
{"text":"In one of the most beautiful retail centers in all of Phoenix, this stylish, cozy lounge type restaurant offers some pretty decent Asian fare. Speaking of fare (in this case only fair) was the sushi.  Good not great.  If you want the best of the best (sushi) in Phoenix try (and see my review) for Sushi Ken in Ahwatukee.  With respect to the Korean, Chinese-ish fare that remains... Thank goodness it's better than fair.    In sum, the song (\"Rock Lobster\" by the B-52's) is better than the food - https://youtu.be/ofkzvM7Skxg (am I right or am I right or am I right?) however, it's worth a visit for the vibe and the Korean BBQ.  It's fun and decent."}
{"text":"If your looking for a really good sushi place that has a lot of variety this is it! They have the most sushi options i have ever seen and the quality of the food is outstanding. Very fresh, very tasteful, and filling. The place is also very beautiful with your choice of sitting inside, or outside, we chose outside because it was a beautiful warm night. They have a very beautiful salt water tank inside as well. I was also surprised to see that their Sake was from Forest Grove, OR. Where I live! They actually make it at a brewery that isn't even a mile from my house which I did not know about. I am def going to check it out. The only downfall about this place is the prices! Dinner for 2 came to 90$ but we did have like 4 orders of sushi, coconut shrimp, and entire bottle of sake, wine, and beer... sooo not too bad for everything we ordered lol. Thanks for the awesome experience!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dont come in too often because we live in San Tan but, I can definitely say it is our favorite sushi spot. The atmosphere is a perfect mix of excitement of the tepanyaki and the completely chill vibe with the lantern, plants and salt water fish tank. The music matches perfectly. Plus the service is always exceptional. Ashley is our favorite server. I'm not a hug sushi person because of texture but, we were able to find two rolls I can eat without any issue. Plus, she always has our drinks full and makes sure we are enjoying out time there. I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I live in Las Vegas and love good sushi. I was visiting AZ for business and was very impressed with Rock Lobster. The fish was fresh, impressive happy hour menu, watched Sunday football games on their TV, and the plating was beautiful (even the teriyaki chicken bowl). Glad they also had fresh wasabi bc some sushi places do not have it. What made our party of 6 enjoy the restaurant the most was the service and charismatic personality of our server Ashley! She knew the menu and was able to help me decide which rolls to order, helped change the TV channel so my Vice President could watch the Broncos game, and had a great smile which complimented her positive attitude. You gained 6 loyal customers and all of our future clients. Thank you Rock Lobster and Ashley!"}
{"text":"I came here due to reading all the great reviews. We got here around 5 PM Sunday and ordered a 4 rolls. It took 45-50 minutes to receive all our order and they forgot one of the rolls. Overall the food isn't that great but I see why people come for the happy hour."}
{"text":"I gave it 2 stars overall because the food wasn't to bad honestly it was pretty good, but the place was NOT clean they made an attempt to make it look cool but it isn't.   Worse part is they give very small portions for a very large price Teppan or Hibachi type restaurant are known for there portions this place gives you like kid size portions at the same price go to Benihana you'll be out the same money but get more."}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on here... Whenevr i call, the number is not existent. There was no hours of operation anywhere.. It just 'closing time = late'.   Im thinking this places closed ??"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The vibe is so chill and relaxing and both the times I have went, my waiters were very polite and seemed like high quality people. The food is delicious! They have killer deals too! If you register on their website you get a free $30 dollar meal during your birthday month, and on Sundays it's happy hour all day, which means $5 dollar sushi rolls!!! This is my new go to place."}
{"text":"I loved the sushi here! I will definitely make this a regular place I go to. The sushi was fresh and we'll priced. I went during happy hour for half priced sushi, the variety was generous. I would recommend going here for lunch or dinner if you like sushi."}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi, great ambience and friendly waiters and waitresses. I definitley recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food was a bit pricey for the size of rolls of sushi but really good. No long wait for anything and beautiful view/setting!"}
{"text":"Today I went there under the impression that it was rock lobster power hour at 7:15 and it was at 8:00 . I go here at least 2 times a week and they all know my family and even though I told them that and was misunderstanding the fact that dinners were full price at this time . I explain to them that I didn't want to pay full price because I didn't get my order taken till 7:46 and food served till almost 8 and thinking they will honor the fact that I have been a loyal customer for long time they would not charge me the extra 29 dollars instead they loss on a regular $100 a week spending clients.  It is sad to say that management did nothing to keep us happy .and we will no longer be visiting this location again . Poor customer service and bad after taste with the lack of understanding. And on top of that there was a hair in my daughters soup Wich they never apologized for or acknowledge the fact that is was nasty . There was also cockroaches on the floor and bugs around table . Just saying and the young manager that denied our discount was too busy flirting with two guys sitting in front of us . Very unprofessional is all I can say."}
{"text":"Finally \"rolled\" through here with my mom! What an awesome place for her to work near. Also, there's a groupon for this place up right now.   We got the typical spicy tuna and yellow tail, but the K.I.G roll was outstanding as well as the spicy scallops! Service was phenomenal.  The drinks looked really good but we had to jet. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We decided to do something different this year for New Years Eve; Teppanyaki was the choice! Rock Lobster has two teppanyaki tables so reservations are a must. There were three of us for the 5pm seating on NYE and we were warmly greeted and seated promptly. The Power Hour is a complete bargain! EVERYTHING pretty much outside of lobster dishes on the teppanyaki entree menu is half off! The menu is very expansive with the usual steaks, shrimp, chicken type of dishes, combos but also calamari steaks and seabass too. We opted for the Date Night menu, which on NYE was a Champagne Boule for each (adult), a sushi roll of our choosing, NOT the restaurants!; and a choice of two NY Strip, Chicken, Calamari or Shrimp entrees. All served with rice, (fried or steamed), soup, salad and a app of edamame. Generally if the champagne isn't served, as in this evening, its a sake bomber. Date Night for 2/ $49.95. On the Power Hour we added a Filet/Shrimp Combo, that also came with soup, salad and fried rice. Dinner for 3 with drinks, wine and tea.. $89! We brought much of one dinner home for the next day. The happy hour is expansive. The staff is informative, patient, (as many at our teppanyaki table had LOTS of questions and repeat questions!), fun and the chef is engaging and a wicked great chef! Everything that we ordered was good, fresh and served hot and according to order. THE only one part that keeps this from a 5star review, the door. We were freezing! We asked twice for the door to be closed because we all put our wool coats on at the teppanyaki table which is warm from all the cooking! It just kept getting opened by the staff and patrons. Not a huge deal because everything else was spot on. Can't wait to go back and have more sushi! Rock Lobster is in a very pristine little upscale enclave bordering the Ocotillo area next door to the Living Room wine bar.. if your not from the Chandler area, take an Uber and make this your night out area!"}
{"text":"We came in with the family and started with the garlic edamame. It was an amazing combination of garlic and sea salt. We then  ordered The Vegas roll and Special CA roll. Kids loved the \"sprinkles\" on the CA roll. The Vegas roll was slightly different then we're use to, the fry it and wrap it in rice. It was amazing. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"My mother in law took us here on Christmas Adam. It's in a nice upscale area that is almost in the middle of nowhere. There's tons of free parking and they have happy hour every day, even on the weekends.  The inside has regular seating and spots at the teppanyaki station. We had the sushi only. All of the fish was fresh and absolutely delicious. The presentation was beautiful and every bit was perfection. A lot of their rolls are spicy so beware of that if you are not a spicy kind of person.  Our favorite rolls were the wicked an the poppin. Both were so good that we kept ordering more rolls to share. The prices are pretty reasonable for sushi especially considering their quality.  This place gets busy so call and make a reservation for the weekends or around the holidays!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in the East Valley, Ashley is our favourite server, she's great, and the entire atmosphere and eating experience is simply sublime. Would definitely recommend going during happy hour, and ordering the chimmichanga or the roses roll. happy eating"}
{"text":"Good and service was amazing night!! The chef was funny and the show he put on was the best! We will be back."}
{"text":"We go to Rock lobster for our twins birthday every year. This year is the last. We walked up and asked do be seeded at the Teppan table. The hostess looked at the table (where no one was sitting) turned to us and said with a frustrated look and said that the next time available was 7:15. It was 6:55? No worries for us. We wanted to order drinks and sushi first anyway. I then asked the waitress if it was still HH...she looked at me and laughed saying that it ended at 6? Some places end HH at 7...I didn't think it was an odd question and certainly did not appreciate being laughed at. We also wanted to take advantage of PH prices. Then we were told only at 8pm seating. This is now 7:45 and the table had not even been prepped. No one else was coming for the 8pm PH. Then the chef was not very gun until we said it was the twins bday. He then did a few funny things but scared my 13 year old so bad she screamed and was in tears. The food was mediocre, portion size small and they do not even ask if you're finished with a dish before swiping it from in front of you. They did just that three times to us. Just a horrible experience ALL around!!!! We will NEVER be back and will be sure to share our $188 dinner for four (3 Teppan, 2 sushi rolls, two sodas, 2 glasses of wine) experience with all that inquire."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the bad reviews, my boyfriend and I went in and the food was amazing and came out super fast, our server Shay, was amazing also! Such a sweetheart and helped us pick new things! The other servers checked up on us whenever they had a free second ! There was nothing to complain about! We will be back when we are back on this side of town! Thank you Rock Lobster!"}
{"text":"Very excellent service! Friendly environment.  We were from out of town and made to feel very welcomed.  Food was delicious.  Filet mignon was cooked to perfection.  Alcoholic beverages (lemon drop martini and aloha something) were lacking a little flavor and glasses were smaller than normal for pricing."}
{"text":"I want to be very clear: The food is really good. This review is about the service which has highs and lows.  Heather usually waits on me and my coworkers when we go there. She is awesome and makes great recommendations. She is really cool and kept us coming back.  I removed two whole stars from this place because of the waitress we got last time, Amanda. She was pretty slow to take our order at lunch time and refused to let us use our groupon on the lunch menu. Whatever, everyone has rules (even though we had already used it 4 times on lunch items before) so we ordered and it was good as usual. She never refilled my water and she brought us our checks incorrectly. Basically, she made us not really want to come back when we are usually loyal customers."}
{"text":"Tried the lunch special sashimi with spicy tuna hand roll and miso. I liked the miso mix. The pieces were decent side. For 3 pieces of tun, salmon, yellowtail and roll for 13 bucks or whatever is not a bad deal. Going to try for a happy hour sometime but not sure."}
{"text":"We went to Rock Lobster after a bad experience trying to dine at another local Teppanyaki restaurant that same night (we had to walk out). This was a night and day difference. We arrived at 8pm during their \"Power Hours\" in which certain dished are discounted. We had a really great Teppanyaki experience with chef George. His presentation was really fun and we enjoyed great conversation with him as well. The food was really great as well- we were a party of 3 and tried the chicken, shrimp, and steak. The sangria was also very good. Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. The food is incredible However, the service is even better. Polite, courteous, and all over making sure you are waited on properly. I was suprised to find out tonight that manager was not the owner. You could tell by the way she carried herself and paid attention to detail that she treated this establishment as her own.  I could go on and on but the only way you'll get it is if you go there yourself. So just do it. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great dining experience?excellent service Thanks to Stan & Caitlin?lovely indoor/out atmosphere?sashimi.....tempera shrimp Prepared to perfection?happy hour prices made me happy!?????"}
{"text":"This is one of our regular spots for both Teppan and Sushi! Rudy the chef is amazing, we love sitting at his teppan table. The Habachi steak is marinaded and so tender. Can't go wrong with the poppin roll either. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"An amazing patio area.! They have fresh wasabi is so freaking delicious don't ever  order that paste I promise  you will never go back to regular wasabi again. Great sushi and Teppanyaki wonderful atmosphere here will love it!! Great date night place..."}
{"text":"This is a great place.  They have a fantastic variety of rolls that provide options for any sushi lover.  The Poppin roll is always a favorite, and if you like a little spice to your sushi, I recommend the K.I.G.  They offer great deals for happy hour, and have great daily specials.  Sunday being my favorite for all day happy hour."}
{"text":"We have been to the Sushi Room previously, before the new venue and Teppan tables were added, our experiences have always been 4 or 5 Star, not anymore.  I don't know if they are trying to become an I Teppan & Sushi wannabe or maybe a Honmachi Grill, neither of which we now patronize.  I have had amazing sushi and other delectables in the past, not so last evening.  We went for gyozas, one of our favorites,  me Lollipop Roll, Truffle Steak roll, and Yellow-tail and Octopus sushi, and my date went for the \"safe\" hamburger.  Well, the Gyozas were pan fried to a crisp and \"greasy\" lump, uneatable, returned.  Lollipop Roll, OK but not as good as I have had in the past, Truffle Roll, steak on top appeared old, and crunchy topping had the same flavor as the greasy Gyozas.  Hamburger was ordered with aioli on the side, on the \"side\" appeared to be a glob on the plate next the bun and partially under the fries instead of in a separate bowl, and the burger was still slathered with the \"side\" aioli.  Waitress was clueless, she offered to leave the fries so my date could have something to eat while I had my sushi/rolls, so ok but she then proceeded to remove the hamburger from the plate with her bare hands and carried it back to the kitchen.  I will abbreviate the remainder of the missteps, asked for utensils for hamburger plate, had to ask three times, asked for ketchup twice, water twice, used a Groupon and after we paid the bill, notice they hadn't taken off the Gyozas, I said forget it and headed for the door.  I have owned restaurants in the past and I always advise people to complain in person; however in this case there were so many poor products, service and disregard for proper operation of an eating establishment, I just made notes on my bill and advised we would seek out other favorite Sushi Restaurants, we have always loved Shimogamo, a little farther away so was hoping Sushi Room would stay but looks like Sushi/Lobster or whatever it is will be in the rear-view mirror."}
{"text":"Heather is outstanding. First time and she rocked it. Food was great. Fresh sushi. Poppin was so good!"}
{"text":"My experience here was average. My father came to visit me and this was a place we tried for dinner that night. This is the first Teppanyaki place I've gone to in the valley and I chose it because it had better reviews and it was mediocre. The quality of the protein was great but there was a major lack in overall flavor. I asked what type of sauce the chef was using to make all the food and it was soy sauce. Previous teppanyaki places I've been to had used multiple sauces and it was very flavorful. The chef was nice but the show was boring. My other guest had never been to a teppanyaki place so they enjoyed the show but I've definitely seen better. The chef wanted us to put our plates close to the Hibachi grill so he could put the food on our plates without reaching over which made it awkward because then we can't reach over to eat our food while it's being plated until after. By the time he was done cooking everyone's proteins, rice and veggies and we grabbed our plates, the food was cold. The guy serving drinks and taking orders for the chef was dressed in a zip up hoodie and a hat and seemed like a manager or owner but was not very personable. I would look for a better place unless you've never had teppanyaki before and you would prefer to not drive somewhere else."}
{"text":"It wasn't a rock It was a Rock Lobster Rock Lobster  Besides being a fun song from the B52s, Rock Lobster is a teppanyaki and sushi restaurant in Chandler. We came in late on a Thursday night for teppanyaki and to use a Groupon that was about to expire.   Upon arrival, we were not greeted so we walked around with confused looks on our faces trying to find an employee to assist us. Eventually, we were greeted and sat but it really shouldn't have taken that long.   To drink I got a Red Dragon, which is pomegranate vodka, orange liqueur and a splash of cranberry juice. I would not recommend getting that drink as it tasted like medicine and was not enjoyable.   For teppanyaki it was just us and another couple that wanted to watch the chef. To begin he lit the plates on fire, then flung rice balls into the other customer's mouth to catch, and ended with the obligatory onion volcano (plus train!). Not sure if that's the standard show here. While pleasant enough, we felt our chef was over it and did the minimum to get done for the night.  Our food was okay. I feel like I received more veggies here than at the big teppanyaki chain that rhymes with henibana's, which was nice. And my chicken wasn't dry like it almost always is at the other place, but you definitely get less shrimp here.   The bill at the end of the meal seemed pretty in-line with most teppanyaki places. We would to loved to have been offered dessert but I think they were more concerned about having us leave since it was already closing time.  Oh well, not sure if we will be back."}
{"text":"Good sushi, had three 4 different rolls. Two regular two specialty. Try the chimichanga roll!Some Half price for happy hour. Wife had Korean Short Rib bowl. Tasty but beef was a little chewy. Daughter had the Terriaki plate. Big serving with veggies and rice. Nice meal.  Overall nice experience, open patio."}
{"text":"Hands down the best eel nigiri I've ever eaten, and I love Japanese food and order the eel nigiri pretty much anytime I visit a new Japanese restaurant. Their salmon was very smooth in both the nigir and roll version, and they have some creative rolls too! The place has a nice atmosphere, friendly servers, and their tables are covered in sushi trivia to entertain your party and shorten your wait. Definitely check this place out if you're near!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying if you haven't been here before boy oh boy are you missing out. Looking for afordable sushi, fresh sushi and a variety than this place is a must. Poppin roll is out a this world. Half price teppan at 5 and 8pm everyday you will not be disappointed. Awesome and attentive staff too. Big shout out to BRETT aka super waiter went above and beyond!! Made our dining experience just fabulous!!! my go to sushi place!"}
{"text":"Sushi was absolutely delicious and the atmosphere is great!  There was live entertainment on the patio when we were there for lunch... a guy playing covers on the guitar-it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing sushi place! Everything on the menu and every thing we ordered was BOMB!! We ordered- dirty south, kig, popping roll. The dirty south was by far the best roll ever ordered! The staff was super friendly. Make sure you ask for Heather- she was just wonderful. Can't wait to go back:)"}
{"text":"Cool Atmosphere and Music! Decent Food....  Cool atmosphere with good music playing at an appropriate level. The food tasted good, but my chicken noodle dish didn't blow my mind. It definitely was something I would get again but it could've had a little more flavor or sauce or something to jazz it up a bit. The sushi salad Donna had looked and tasted a little bit better than mine.  Prices are about normal at $10-$15 average per person for your regular lunch meals. If you go at night it looks like there's a different menu that definitely cost a little bit more but for what it is it's pretty average for price too.  The service was good everyone was polite greeted us when we came in, and thanked us when we left. So nothing bad to say about that.  We found a Groupon to rock lobster and have seldom made it over to this part of chandler as it is south of the 202 and we don't frequent that area much. I would definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Love this place, outstanding service and great food, sushi is outstanding! Great place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Went here with my SO and her family for an early dinner. We absolutely loved this restaurant.   First, the ambience. From the patio, you get a fresh breeze in your face and overlooking the sunset and the tall, white condos/apts (look like Mykonos inspired) across the street. You kind of feel like you're not in Arizona anymore.   Food/Drink: I didn't drink any of the alcohol because I had to go to work, but everyone else did and they loved their drinks. The sushi was delicious, and their Popper roll (or something similar to that name) is incredible. We all ordered different rolls and dishes and they were all delicious.   Happy Hour: This is just the cherry on top. It's always a pleasant surprise to go to a restaurant and just happen to catch their happy hour. Several sushi dishes were half off and some of the drinks too. That was perfect.   We would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone and can't wait to go back with our friends."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many restaurants with teppanyaki tables but this was outstanding!  The quality and ingredients are top notch and cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend giving this a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place a few times..one day we finally stopped in. Wow.  Was it worth it.  It happened to be a Sunday ..  The inside was very quaint and intimate and clean. We were in luck happy hour on Sunday's!!!!!  We were immediately greeted seated and waited upon.. Our server was incredible.  He immediately told us about happy hour on drinks and food. We ordered drinks and looked over the menu.. Sangria was fantastic and the beer was cold. We ordered  a variety of sushi... Rolls, hand rolls sashimi.... Just fantastic.. The presentation was, beautiful, the selection was unique and the taste was incredible.   We had the seared beef sushi with asparagus...It was incredibly succulent.   Wow amazing... All of the sushi was  fresh and fantastic.. They also had a variety of chilled saki.. Our waiter was knowledgeable and answered our questions.. The peach sparking saki was so refreshing and addicting..   Great place ...remember it's very intimate so if your going with a group call ahead"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. We came early on  Saturday to celebrate our twins' second birthday (with our four other kids). We arrived just the second they opened (11 am) they told us they don't do Teppanyaki at the table that early and when they saw our disappointment they changed their mind. They couldn't have been more accommodating and helpful. Our kids had a great show from an awesome and funny chef and the servers were attentive but not hovering.  Perfect experience, thank you for making this day so special for us."}
{"text":"Excellent teppan chef performance. We had the calamari with scallops and the chicken. Both had great flavor and were cooked perfectly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is always amazing. Love the Sushi!  Heather is hands down one of the best servers in the business!"}
{"text":"We went there for a Groupon. Everything was delicious. They have a happy hour too (all day Sunday).......obviously you can't use the Groupon on that, but other less pricey options available. The rolls were fresh and service was great for a busy Friday night."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere is great! Came here for the date night special and it was such a good deal. The strawberry butterfish roll is to die for!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch with three others, today. Very good chicken katsu... very crisp, not at all oily, moist chicken breast. The sushi lunch #1 had good sized portions of shrimp, tuna, and salmon nigiri, with an excellent California roll. The chicken teriyaki had moist grilled chicken in a tangy teriyaki sauce. The mochi with green tea ice cream (green tea ice cream in a mochi ball) was a hit, too!  Very quick and professional service on a quiet lunch hour. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Sushi and rolls are delicious! Service is top notch. My server was Dan and he was on it. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Me giving one star is gracious. My roommate and I went here tonight. I have been to this restaurant when it was just the sushi room and loved it! However tonight was different. I made a reservation for 630, the hostess asked us to sit at the bar while they prepared the table,and then sat 12 other people at the table before she remembered the two of us. When we sat down we ordered, the waitress took forever to bring the soup which was Luke warm at best and tasted like soapy dish water. The salad didn't come until the chef started making our food. This was good. But as everyone was receiving their fried rice and steamed rice,my roommate and I noticed we had not gotten our steamed rice. We had to ask another waiter for rice. I had new York steak and shrimp. My roomie had chicken and filet mignon. My steak was over cooked I asked for medium rare. Her chicken as well was over cooked. Neither were seasoned barely at all. The shrimp was good tho. Unfortunately after I saw the owner ask a table full of people who were done eating and chatting if they could please move because while they appreciate their business there were people waiting. I knew my complaints would be irrelevant. Needless to say I'm disappointed in the food, the service, all of it. And will never go back for tempanyaki. They have alot of kinks to work out."}
{"text":"Rock Lobster fish was so foul on Sunday July 31. The fish on top of the sunshine roll tasted so so so bad!! It was so fishy, the taste made me want to hurl. Luckily nobody got sick. Also the standing menu they keep on the table was so dirty."}
{"text":"Slightly unimpressed, and annoyed. I live downtown, so this place isn't exactly around the corner. With that being said, I still chose to do the groupon and try the place out. I like Benihana's for special occasions, so I figured trying this place out at a discount would be a good way to find out if its comparable.   The place is SUPER small. I felt a little cramped. Our server, Christopher, was friendly. Our visit started off on the wrong foot though, when arriving at 3pm was told that the Teppan did not start until 5pm. Now, unless I had a MAJOR blond moment, I did NOT see that anywhere at all on their website, nor the groupon voucher. Very frustrated, figuring we drove 20+ miles for THAT, not just sushi rolls. My 7 year old gave me the stink eye the rest of the visit too, as he was looking forward to it. We chose the California tempura sushi rolls, with the teriyaki chicken rice both. Both were just okay.   With that being said, I feel like we could have had a totally different experience, had we had the teppan we came for. So, yes I will buy another groupon, and yes I will make sure to come after 5. I will write a review, so we shall see!"}
{"text":"Super friendly and courteous staff; I enjoy visiting rock lobster as often as I can. The food is delicious and the Tepan makes for a very enjoyable and interactive dinner experience! The patio-style formatting makes the restaurant more open which makes for great ambiance and lighting but also explains that some a few flies may be around.. if a few flies are able to annoy and distract you from your dinner experience, maybe try finding more entertaining company ;)"}
{"text":"I rated a \"3\" because my comment isn't based on the food or staff - I would rate them a \"5\". While we love this restaurant, especially on Sundays' for lunch, we are over the live music.  The restaurant is too small to have this inside - you can't visit/talk with friends, the music is way too loud and is distracting.  Maybe wait until it cools down and put the music back on the patio so it becomes \"background\" rather than \"in your face\".  We've cut back on our Sunday Funday here - it's no longer a \"funday\" for us."}
{"text":"My new favorite teppanyaki place. Rock Lobster is so much better than that mediocre restaurant. Jeffrey Wu was a fantastic teppanyaki chef. Highly recommend this experience."}
{"text":"Amazing creative rolls! They offer numerous dinner date specials and happy hour deals.   The orange chicken was kind of bland but everything else was great!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  We came in to use a Groupon and it was so worth it!  The service was great and the sushi was fresh and clean. Very tasty and pretty good deal. I don't usually leave a sushi place satisfied for less then $70 with me a my wife. We got out for under that and loved it!  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"It was a Dinner Date Saturday night - therefore, in no hurry & want a leisurely pace. The appetizers & sushi were creative, full of flavor & just very good. Had the gyoza & the Sumomono for starters - which were delivered to the table at lightning speed - small example of the servie pace to come. For sushi entrees we had Lollipop and the Ultimate Shrimp Tempura - again creative, full of new & different flavors and excellent. We had little time, very little, to enjoy our startes as the sushi arrived after about the 3rd bite of the starters. What's this? A contest? We had 2 martinis very good. Our waitress was very attentive in her service - however - felt the need to ask if this was their version of express service. We both eat at different paces which is normally not a problem - not here. As soon as my partner was finished her plate was whisked away & then bill appeared faster than any of the food previously. At this point it was very frustrating & we felt exceptionally rushed...I think McDonald's actually moves slower. The speed totally took away from the entire meal - which explains the 3 star rating. We decided to try this restaurant 1 more time & specifically ask for a slower. The food is that & I want to give the restaurant an opportunity to fix the speed."}
{"text":"Mondays are one of the best days. Half off all rolls! What's not to love? I absolutely love their strawberry butterfish roll, for those of you that don't like spicy rolls, this one is for you! I've had almost every roll on the menu and they are all quite good. They also have great daily specials. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I bought a livingsocial deal for a dinner for 2 for $50.  Includes 2 beers, 2 large sakes, sushi roll of your choice, edamame, and two entrees (choice of 5 different ones).  I then discovered after checking out the specials on their website that they offer this same deal on Thursday nights...the date night special.  Good to know.  Anyway, overall a great dinner.  I had the calamari entree though and thought it was a bit bland.  Everything else was fabulous though.  We will definitely be taking advantage of that date night special in the near future."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible morales. We went there with a party of 8 for \"date night\" on Thursday. The bill came and they charged us a gratuity of 23.00$ for each couple for a total of 92$ in tips. This is on top of the 40$ tip we gave the chef for cooking our meal. The manager, Heather is extremely unprofessional and said sorry nothing I can do but I can give you a 25$ gift card to come back and see us again. We decided to never come back as this is an establishment who does not value their customers.   The date night was supposed to be 50$ for each couple, however they charged the gratuity on 107$. They have lost at least 8 customers for life. Sad sad place to be a part of.   Needless to say, the service was horrible."}
{"text":"We visited this place just after Christmas for a snack.  The owner/bartender was very friendly and we ordered moscow mules.  They were good.  Service was a little slow and the sushi was ok.  To be fair, we are sushi purists, so rolls are really not our thing, we like fresh with veggies, and non standard creations.  I would not say it was bad, but overall ok."}
{"text":"Very unique sushi bar and teppanyaki grill. Beautiful atmosphere. Great service. Fantastic food; I'd say even better than Benihana. Another thing is they have awesome daily deals so it won't break your bank for a good date, just look on their website for details. My favorite roll is the Blazing Thunder. Yum. Definitely my go-to sushi destination. Going there for lunch again today actually! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fantastic and the sushi was superb.  Had the surfer roll and I tell you if you miss ordering that one you've missed a great dish. Will come back her with family next time."}
{"text":"Super friendly, and fun staff!! We came in on Sunday, and it was Happy Hour ALL DAY!! The music playlist was awesome, and the decor and vibe was even better!! I haven't had sushi that great in a while!! I'm stoked that we have found a new place to call our favorite sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Great experience!  I am not a fan of Sushi, and I eat all my meals with a fork. That said, my husband and I ordered a few appetizers and rolls, and absolutely loved it. The staff was friendly and accommodating, and the presentation was spot-on. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. The poppin roll is the best sushi roll I've ever had. Mmm. Always running a happy hour or Groupon special. My son loves their kids meal options."}
{"text":"Spicy yellowtail (Poke) salad and sunshine roll are incredible.  Worth the drive from  Tucson to eat"}
{"text":"The sushi is fresh and the atmosphere is great! You really can not beat the happy hour pricing! This is our new go to sushi restaurant! It's worth the 30 minute drive!"}
{"text":"I love the great selection of rolls, sushi and poke! Always fresh and great tasting! Great happy hour specials! And now with the heat you can get good discounts on Thursday with their beat the heat special!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here at least once a month, we love it!  The strawberry butterfish roll is amazing and we love the happy hour deals!! The name recently changed to Rock Lobster, but the menu seemed to stay the same."}
{"text":"The food here was great; until they forgot my sushi. I was very patient with the fact that I was told by the server that there was a back order on sushi. 20-30 minutes later, I was told it was either forgotten or served to the wrong table. Don't get me wrong, I like the food, but the sole fact that they forgot and then gave me excuses makes me not want to come back here again, if they forget orders so easily and don't offer any compensation for my wasted time."}
{"text":"I finally found an ok sushi place! By far one of the better sushi places in Chandler. Nice ambiance, staff is a little slow."}
{"text":"I've been before and the place was decent, today I brought my family and I must say they may need some employee and management training. I ordered my meal chicken Katsu well it came with scraps of metal in it, yes metal!!!! I notify the server and she has the food taken back and recooked I also asked that they please don't put in onions and mushrooms when it's remade. My remade food comes back full of mushrooms. Server didn't make sure it had none and didn't notice me picking them out either! Bill comes and yes you know it they are charging me for the scrap metal chicken katsu!!! I had to embarrassingly ask why would they charge me for it! I would think as an I'm sorry that would've been not on the bill without questioning!!! I think they staff needs more training and more attention to detail! I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I follow Rock Lobster on Instagram because their pictures and food look amazing.  I've gone a handful of times, trying to give the place a good college try, but no matter how pretty the presentation, the place is really just mediocre.  The service is unique and a bit awkward but the servers always have great drink recommendations. The cocktails are pretty good. Lots of flavor.  With all the specials constantly going on it also gave a hint of struggle instead of confidence."}
{"text":"Had an excellent lunch at Rock Lobster for our date day. Had the blazing thunder role to start and that was amazing, highly recommend!! Came with friend jalapeños on the side. We also had the chicken katsu, Korean bbq beef, chicken egg role and chicken wings. Everything was fantastic, cooked and seasoned well. Side of stir fried veggies were a great addition to the meal. Our server Colin was super friendly and helpful. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, Im vacationing for the Fiesta Bowl, staying in Tempe and have been craving sushi.. this place satisfied that craving. Staff is great. Music is great. Atmosphere is awesome! Hopefully I can make it back before leaving town.."}
{"text":"I called to set up teppanyaki reservations for a little after 8p on a Monday with a party of 6  (that turned into 4) bI explained I got off work at 8p and that I worked just up the street (Google says 7min away) I was told that the last seating was 8pm and that I should come another time. How can you tell 6 (now 4 to be fair) NEW customers they should come another night?  It is a Monday when you are NOT booked solid & not a prime night?  I have to give Heather (GM) credit she answered this VERY promptly and assured me this was a mistake and she (and here staff) would LOVE to still invite my party in.   Great job Heather, I will see you tonight and hope the service and great food I keep hearing about make me change my mind....and my review..  For the record, You and you staff get 3.5 stars for making up for your mistake, we all have bad days and I get that that's why I gave you a second chance.    Without the phone call I would give you 4.5 stars, the food was beyond good, Heather made a HUGE recovery but to most people would not have give you a second chance. First impressions are most people's only impression.    Overall because the food and mostly Heathers recovery I will be back (with friends), GREAT Food scallops, steak and Vegas roll were to die for, can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I basically come here once a month.  I can honestly say that I had a bad experience my first visit here about 2 years ago.  Little did I know that I'd land a job about a mile away and start coming here all the time.  First things first, 1/2 Sushi on Mondays.  They have the best sushi that I have tried in the Phoenix area, and for a $7 roll on Monday...Its a no-brainer.   Customer service has always been fantastic. They know you by name, and usually know your order by heart lol. They have messed up my friends very particular order a couple of times, but they are really quick to get back on their feet and redeem themselves very well.  Its in a great location of South Chandler. Its never too busy to find a table (I go during Lunch). This place honestly is kind of like a hidden gem. I don't think many people know about it - but should!  All in all, they have a nice selection of drinks. The sushi value and variety is amazing. Restaurant cleanliness is great, and customer service is always on point.  I'll forever be a happy customer as long as I'm in Chandler.  TIP 1) First time customers: Try the Poppin Roll (if you like shrimp/calamari)  TIP 2) If you are super hungry and liked fried/spicy things: Try the Chimichanga Roll."}
{"text":"Bought 2 groupons. Decided to try it out for lunch on a Saturday.  The menu was just okay. We're spoiled with the variety offered at our local San Diego haunt. Ordered 3 rolls...we never saw a piece of fish. In the middle of the rolls was a mushy substance which may have been pureed fish, not sure. Very disappointed.  Also, they need to remove the nasty stained pillows from the booths. They were pretty disgusting. We will use our other groupon but after that we'll not return."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to Rock Lobster and I am highly impressed. First of all they have some great specials (all rolls were half off when I came in). I wasn't sure what to order and the waiter recommended the poppin roll. I cannot say how AMAZING this is! It said jalapeño and I'm not a huge fan but the flavor was perfect. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour until 6PM. We got the gyoza & spring roll apps ($5 ea) and then 3 sushi rolls : Philly (not on HH); Spicy Tuna, & Sunshine Roll ($4-7 ish ea), also the drinks were well priced on HH. Service was super quick &everything was really tasty. We will be back."}
{"text":"Very nice and cozy seating. Excellent weekday lunch specials. Had the Rock Lobster Burger made with Wagyu beef. One of the best burgers I have had. Full of favor and not greasy. My wife had the Sashimi Lunch 1 with 3 pieces each of Yellowtail, Salmon, Tuna. All good and fresh. We definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"This place made my mouth happy! Outstanding drinks...great sushi and fun environment without being l loud.  We'l loved it!"}
{"text":"We decided to go on a sunday in the evening; we were the third table there, can someone please explain to me why it took over 30 mins to get our order taken? The place was not at all packed ... Alright let's go ahead and let that slide; fast forward to when we finally get service and the waitress walked away when we weren't done ordering??? I was very confused at this point; am i getting punk? when do the cameras come out and Justin Bieber pops out saying it was all a prank? After 7 mins that our waitress walked away we finally got ahold of another waiter who finished taking our order. Waited about 15 minutes or so before they bring out the first roll with person's 1 entree .... and 20 mins later person's 2 entree comes out all hot and ready while my food has gotten cold from all the waiting. Let's go ahead and talk about checking out, our waitress comes over with the check ( once again we had to tackle someone down to get service) We ended up using our groupon which left us with a balance of 5 bucks with some change, we waited 15 mins for someone to come over and take out check, after another 10 minutes of waiting to get our change a waitress comes over and gives us our change but wow they were off by like three bucks! Do they not know how to work the cash register?? i've heard that the cash register tells you how much you are suppose to give back?? ( Clearly a joke, i've worked in fast food before) oh i was fuming , i don't think i'm a difficult customer but at this point i was hungry and angry, i was hangry. The food was overpriced for the portions and was honestly not all the great, the rolls seem to be made with old rice (as it was very hard) and noodles was something we could have order at panda express (with better customer service). I was not all impressed with this location or the experience.   Overall: Would i recommend?? Heck no! we all work hard for our money and i felt like i paid to be mistreated, i do not wish for no one to go through all that."}
{"text":"When we arrived to eat here for lunch, it smelled like sewage in the restaurant. The table was sticky,  and I think the rag they used to wipe it off was dirty. The sushi was ok, but I've had much better."}
{"text":"So delicious! A+ atmosphere with garage doors that open to the outside giving you an indoor/outdoor feel. Sushi was amazing, great service."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here!  We came here for the \"date night\" special on Thursdays!  We sat at the teppanyaki table and got all of our courses!  We got to pick any sushi roll which was amazing because I figured they would only let you choose the regular ones so I was pleasantly surprised!  My boyfriend got the steak, I got the chicken.  The teppanyaki cook was so entertaining and put on a great show.  After we ate and drank our amazing food we got the bill and for everything that we got, it was such a great deal!   The servers were friendly, the food was delicious, and we will be going back again very soon for their Thursday deal!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Great food good servers although a bit of a wait . Over all it was. Nice . My kids liked the shows from the chief cook   ."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now, never posted to give them the benefit of the doubt.   Service is painfully slow for Tappan table side.   Waiter had too many tables to deliver quality service.  At one point he walked away from our table in mid-sentence.   I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We showed up around 2p and were the only customers.  The sushi was \"ok\", the crab puffs were good, the calamari was inedible (too chewy), and the chicken teriyaki was ok but served in a dish that should have been thrown away.  While the waitress was nice, we had to ask for water refills and she never came around to check on us. With a broken dish and the dirty soy sauce bottles I don't know that we will go back. There was plenty of things that needed to be cleaned (The soy sauce bottles are so dirty I wouldn't even touch them) but the staff was too busy chatting rather than cleaning or paying attention to us."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. So we came for lunch and its a seat yourself policy. There were quite a few people in for lunch on a Wednesday between Christmas & New Years. They have a large sushi bar and have garage doors that open to connect an outdoor patio. We chose a 4 person table against the farthest wall. It had a large wall-wide planter with vines trailing down. After sitting & ordering and looking at the planter I noticed a large piece of blue/grey tarp showing out the bottom. Not a very nice addition to the feature. The decor is pleasant but the tables are kinda close. I dont like to be crammed into tables together. Well I ordered a green tea & chirache bowl. The Hubs ordered the bento box with the Korean short ribs. Both came off the lunch menu. See pics posted. Both were about $8-10.  The waitress came back with our drinks and informed me they were out of green tea so here was the pomegranate whatever tea. I said Im sorry but all i wanted was the green tea. She assumed i would be okay with HER choice. Nope. So i drank my coconut water. She took her tea back. As we were waiting i happened to start noticing small fruit flies hovering around the table. I tried unsuccessfully to kill them but they were fresh...just came in from the big open garage doors. So our food came and the Hubs asked for a fork. The waitress brought one but didnt check it cuz it was dirty! EW!!! I dont tolerate dirty cutlery! There is just NO excuse for that!! She scurried to bring a clean one and we got started eating. The longer we stayed the more annoyed i got about the fruit flies. Frankly I shoulda sent my sushi back cuz who the hell knows how affected the place is by fruit flies! I am shuddering to think about it now. Im sure ive eaten worse having travelled in Mexico. Chock that one up here yeeps! As we were finishing up I mentioned to her about the fruit flies. She said \"I know. Its terrible\". Wait. Wait. WAIT!!! You KNOW and the problem isnt being addressed?!?!? Ok. Thats it for me!! I ask for the manager. Collin came over and i told him about the fruit flies. He said the owners are getting together with the other 2 in their block to fix the problem. He assured me that they properly store their food and its not contaminated. Right. Sure. You can say whatever you want me to hear. He was going to comp us our lunch and then he excused himself and came back with a $25 gift card! Yeah. Great. Thanks. He assured us that the NEXT time we came back the problem would be fixed. Next time? Hmmmmmmmmmmm. That might not happen again sorry Collin. So we didnt enjoy our meal, didnt get very good service, dirty cutlery, the decor was not that great and the manager & waitress were aware but didnt do anything but give us a coupon to come back. Right. I didnt use the bathroom cuz i didnt need to so i cant speak about that. There is lots of parking outside. I'm giving 2 stars for the food. It was ok and Hubs enjoyed his meal. Anybody want a $25 coupon for this place? I dont think I'll be using it."}
{"text":"My husband and I go there weekly.  The sushi is always fresh and the staff is great. The lollipop role is amazing!"}
{"text":"Love the makeover! Restaurant is extremely clean, decor is well executed, and staff is not only fun and friendly but also professional (which is hard to find). Teppan chefs are hilarious and I most certainly award the \"dinnertainment\" with five stars. I tired the fillet and scallop combo and it was top notch."}
{"text":"I have been to Rock Lobster on several occasions. The first few were ok.. but my last experience was a complete joke.  Terrible service (the server could only provide attention to half of the table at each visit), a lackluster chef and even more boring food.  This place is not inexpensive.. and you hope to be entertained and have great service for the price you pay. The children's teppanyaki meals are over $10 and are about half of what is served at any other local teppanyaki restaurant.   I ordered the sea bass and was appalled at the piece of rubber fish I was served. For nearly $40, I expected a lot more.   No chance I will return."}
{"text":"Walked in with a Groupon and left as a fan.  My son and I decided to go out to lunch.  He wanted sushi so we looked on Groupon and found Rock Lobster.  We decided to start with the spicy garlic edamame, which was delicious, and then we chose three rolls to try.  There were so many options that sounded delicious and had a hard time choosing, but ended up with the California roll, the Dirty South, and the Truffle Surf and Turf.  The California roll was what you'd expect.  It was fresh and yummy.  The Dirty South was spicy and absolutely delicious...our favorite by far.  The Truffle Surf and Turf didn't turn out to be as good as we had hoped, but hey, we tried something new.  Our server, Christopher, was great, making sure our drinks were filled and our table was cleared when needed.  The atmosphere was also great and they have many daily specials, including a Tuesday Date Night special that includes edamame, a sushi roll, teppan entres, and drinks for $49.99.  Sounds great to me...I'll be back! If going for dinner though, it seems that reservations may be needed.  Can't wait to return with the hubby!"}
{"text":"Incompetent wait staff and unprofessional management    Never ever going back again. Loved the place and  this was my 5th visit.  Severely disappointed when calling the manager for being over charged and I had actually tipped more than 20%, he was not accountable for his staff for overcharging me which I calculated the tip on. Partied ways and rescinded the tip all together. The establishment lacked stewardship, accountability and facilitated fraud by overcharging me."}
{"text":"You can't beat the Monday night 1/2 priced rolls special.  In fact, there's a good special just about every night.  The rolls are very good, I recommend the KIG.  The service was good and the atmosphere is nice.  Except for the added hibachi it's identical to the previously named Sushi Room."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi place! Their happy hour prices for the rolls and drinks are great. You can't beat them! I definitely recommend the poppin roll and the wicked roll. I could eat those every day :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here since the grand opening. Dan and his crew are very friendly, professional and the food is off the hook. If you want to enjoy outstanding service, delicious food with a fun atmosphere then look no further. I highly recommend this restaurant to all of my friends and family."}
{"text":"Service is spotty.  Hostess was not friendly and the waiter was only quick with our check.  He also sold us on the fresh wasabi but failed us in bringing ginger little soy sauce dishes.  The popper roll with fried shrimp on top is very good.  The coconut shrimp and lettuce wraps are overpriced. I would only come here for happy hour (half price rolls and marked appetizers).  You cannot use the groupon during happy hour.  Interior was nice and the fresh wasabi ($1.50) is a must."}
{"text":"We had the tepanyaki calamari/scallops and calamari/filet combos. Great food all around. Also enjoyed the Popin and Sunshine rolls. Great service. Would has given 5 stars if fried rice wasn't a bit on the dry side. Would have been nice to have the Japanese mayo dipping sauce with the tepanyaki."}
{"text":"Used the living social deal!! Outstanding service...tons of outstanding food!! Will totally come back!! :)"}
{"text":"Something has changed. I used to LOVE this place. My boyfriend and I would come here almost every Friday, back when it was the Sushi Room. They changed names and things were still great for a while. But then minor things started changing for the worse. The happy hour increased it's prices, which I was bummed about, but not a deal breaker. Then slowly the staff whom we had become friends with, started turning over. Within a couple months there is but one or two wait staff from the original great crew. The new staff is pretty good too, but the turnover from people that had been there for years was rather perplexing. Now the sushi is changing. I always order the salmon sashimi when I come here. I so looked forward to the creamy flavorful bite with each piece. It would stop me in my tracks during a conversation because it was so delicious. Now it's nothing compared to what it used to be. The slices are thinner and the marbling is very much hit or miss. No longer is one bite so tasty that it draws all of my attention. Instead it makes me sad that they have cheapened out. They are also making their rolls smaller, last time getting 6 pieces instead of their typical 8. I'm not sure what is happening behind the scenes but it's not good. As a regular customer I notice the change and because of it, no longer crave my Friday sushi."}
{"text":"A groupon brought us here. Walked in the door and didn't know where to go as there wasn't a host stand. A young man did come up and great us, and take us to our table. We came for the teppan experience (or food at least) and found out we could not order that from the regular seats. There are 2 large teppan tables and 1 was full the other apparently not open. We ordered drinks, and half the teppan table had become available. We asked our server if we could move to the table and were told no. He did end up asking another server if we could move there, and ended up telling us we could go there but there was only one cook and it would be over half an hour before the next round.  So we stayed put and ordered from the menu. Lollipop sushi roll delicious. Teriyaki chicken just OK, small portion.  Perhaps the teppan is great, but we probably won't be back to find out. Website states reservations are recommended but not required. Took a chance with not making any, but when room opened at the table it was if they didn't want us to sit there. I understand these tables usually wait for a group of people to cook, but if no one else comes in for the teppan, then we don't get any? Left disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here on my birthday and enjoyed an amazing meal!  Sada is amazing and see they are updating everything!  What a beautiful restaurant and a great staff!"}
{"text":"They have a lot of daily specials make sure to check them all out, the sushi was amazing though and they have a lot of different options! They also just opened Teppan Grill tables and it looks really good"}
{"text":"Parallel to the restaurant Sauce and a completely different world. I have picked up their over priced food and did not like the experience I had . They were rude and have many rules on how you can order there. Their sushi pfft I think fryes or hate to say it Winco has better sushi. Not a very cute place considering the cute area it's in. Not going back here."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Nuff Said...try the place you'll never go back to your neighborhood sushi joint!!! We don't!"}
{"text":"Bought the Groupon and decided to try the place out as my husband and I are always looking for new sushi spots. Ultimately disappointing. The service was slow and not very attentive even though we came when it was almost empty. Then we ordered a variety of starters and rolls. The best thing we tried were the gyoza. They were pretty tasty but everything else was just ok. Even with the Groupon discount I felt like it was overpriced and I paid too much for what we received."}
{"text":"Shared Squid salad and veggie tempura, veggie yakisoba for her and beef yakisoba for me. A wine for her an Union Jack for me. Very good meal and service by Chris."}
{"text":"A new go-to lunch spot for me. Service is always very quick, and they have a really solid lunch menu. For $11 you get a roll, three pieces of nigiri and miso soup or a salad, and will give you a discount if you can prove you work in the surrounding area. If you're only tagging along with your sushi loving friends they also have cooked traditional options on the lunch menu as well. No matter your lunch choice, they offer a punch card so your sixth meal is free.   I can only base my experiences off their lunch and happy hour, but have been very satisfied with the quality of food, service, and price on each visit."}
{"text":"This use to be our go to sushi spot. The last  three times we have gone it seems to have changed. We wanted it to give it a couple more chances before we threw in the towel completely. The quality and taste just isn't there anymore."}
{"text":"Going off from 240 reviews at 4 stars is usually a safe bet. Today we went in at 1pm and saw about 20 people in a small restaurant. We were seated by a guy that set up down, got us water...............  and then............   nothing.   There were alot of employees all busy doing something and could not get their attention.  After 15 minutes of trying to get someones attention, we finally figured out that this might be one of those painful meals that would take 3 hours of waiting. Always amazed when I see a business that forgets why they are in business.   Very disappointed, as we were looking forward to eating there."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Monday (which happens to be the day when ALL rolls are 1/2 off) and it was yummy!  We split a couple spicy tuna rolls that were really good. I liked that they were actually spicy! I've been to some sushi places where you can't tell the difference between the regular & spicy rolls. We also had the sunshine roll. The lemon complimented the salmon nicely. Very refreshing! In addition we had the jalepeno yellowtail roll. The jalepeno wasn't over-powering and went really well with the fish. My favorite though was the Da Bomb. I liked the fresh eel & tempura combination. In fact, I really liked that the fish tasted fresh with all the rolls we tried.     We also had a seaweed salad & edamame. Both were delicious.  Jaime was our server and she was excellent. She was very attentive & really knew the menu (which isn't easy at a sushi place w/many specialty rolls).  Rock Lobster also looks like it has an excellent Happy Hour that I want to go to. I'll be back when I'm in this area again!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  Split the Tofu Tappan which was enough food for both.  Being a vegetarian it was nice how cautious they were about making good sure my met my needs.    The meal came with soup and shrimp. Obviously I didn't have the shrimp and I was expecting the miso soup, however I was bummed when I realized this soup contained  fish although it is a soy broth. But they knew that there was fish, so they didn't serve it to me.   I give them respect for doing so.    I was really impressed with the customer service at this restaurant. They are very accommodating and gracious."}
{"text":"Happy hour is amazing, food was great, and staff member had great attitudes. Here is the big But the hostess, wasn't the mostest. My date and I showed up early to our reservation about 15 mins. She advised us to sit at the bra until our table was ready, and we waited for 30mins and we saw that other people were being seated. When my date addresses the issue, she was extremely rude and pointed to a table and slammed down our drinks. Rock Lobster needs to retrain her!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour! Half price off select items and 5 dollar signature cocktails! My friends and I got three appetizers, maybe 8 rolls, and a couple of cocktails, and our bill only came to around 75 dollars total (pre-tip)   I probably wouldn't want to come during non-happy hours unless it was a special occasion, because $$$$$$ (typical for sushi places in my experience) but wow, it's a great deal and a perfect opportunity to try some of the fancy rolls they have. Some faves were the Poppin roll and the Cowboy.  The patio is very nice and a great place to relax when the weather is good.  No complaints about the service! We were seated quickly and our waiter was attentive. The food was brought out in a timely fashion, too.  I would definitely return to Rock Lobster for another post-work happy hour!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for teppanyaki and we had not made a reservation and it was a Saturday night at 6:00 pm. Found this place on yelp with four stars and it did not disappoint. I did call ahead which I would recommend. The dinner was delicious and we were all very entertained.  Drinks were brought out quickly and it took a little while for us to order but this type of meal is never expected to go quickly. We ordered the California rolls for an appetizer and soups and salads came out following, all with good timing. Drinks were refilled in a timely manner and and the main entrees all were cooked to perfect temperatures. They have broccoli in the veggie mix for the fried rice which I loved. The New York strip and the filet was nice and tender. Shrimp tasted fresh... always a plus. I don't recall getting told anything about desserts but I couldn't have eaten another bite anyways. We will go back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my boyfriend and we enjoyed reading all the little sushi facts on the tabletops. We were seated right away, and the waitress found us a great table in the corner with lots of space. Split the Waygu burger which was TO DIE FOR. Seriously so good, I can't believe they have this at a sushi place. Service was prompt and just as I was about to get upset that my water glass was empty, someone noticed and filled it. I had the orange chicken last time which was really good with bell peppers and pineapple. They also do half off sushi rolls on Mondays. Fun spot and there's lots more I want to try on the menu! Will be back when in town again"}
{"text":"Visited at about 4 PM on Father's Day and though the seating is slightly limited, they were able to seat 6 of us without a reservation. The prices aren't clearly listed on the website so when you arrive, you might be off-put by the Teppan grill menu. For a holiday, I would definitely recommend a reservation if you want the Teppan grill which we didn't try. That being said, their sushi/ sashimi/ entree menu available at normal tables was reasonably priced and outstandingly priced for happy hour selections. I am so glad we decided to eat here- all the sushi was delicious and they managed to make every roll taste uniquely different. The entrees were also pleasing, I had the RL salmon which I loved. My favorites of the many rolls we ordered were the Strawberry Butterfish, Boom Boom, Dirty South and the Lollipop which I could have eaten all day. The Korean Short Ribs starter was great. We'll be back in to try some of the other rolls available and a special date night at the Teppan tables."}
{"text":"Delicious ! Service was friendly and fast. Can't wait to coffee back for a date night with the hubbyand try the teppan#"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food was on point and I loved the vibe of the place. We sat outside and the weather was beautiful and the staff was excellent. The only bad thing is that if you sit outside you can't order steaks. You can only order at the tables inside because they cook them right in front of you."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for years. I love sushi and it was one of the first places he ever brought me for dinner. It became a regular once to twice per week hangout for a very very long time. Now that we bought a new home in Chandler and are returning to the area, I can't wait for it to be our weekly spot again. It's truly one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever been to, and I've been to hundreds all over the country. The specialty rolls they offer have a great variety of spicy and crunchy options. This is exactly what I look for in a Japanese restaurant. It's not traditional, but I'm not into traditional as I only eat spicy food with a punch. The wait staff is great and attentive, though I think the restaurant may be understaffed on weekend evenings. The one criticism I do have is that they switched to paper napkins, and I prefer a cloth napkin. The new napkins kind of kill the beautiful ambiance they've got going, and remind me of the disposable dentist bibs they attach to chains. Oh, and I miss looking at the jellyfish in the aquarium!  those two criticisms are very minor, and not enough for me to rate this place anything under a 5 star."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Rock Lobster (formerly Sushi Room). The ambiance is great, especially when it gets nice out. They have outdoor seating on couches for casual or classic seats at tables. The wait staff is knowledgable and quick to help. The sushi is some of my favorite I've had.  I highly recommend the Sashimi assortment, which is huge and a great bargain. My wife and kids like the creative rolls.  The Teppan is relatively new and pretty cool. Best thing about it if you are flexible on the timing is that you can get 50% off at 5 and 8 seatings.   They usually have groupings but usually the promotions  (which you can't combine with groupons) are so good that unless you are getting regular priced sushi items like the sashimi assortment, I recommend you just go with the promotions."}
{"text":"Let me first say I've read a lot of reviews about the service. I've never gone to Rock Lobster for the teppanyaki so I cannot speak to that experience. However, the few times I have been there for lunch and dinner we were greeted by several people when we came in, our drinks were refilled regularly, the waiters asked if we had any questions about the menu, and they were happy to provide recommendations when we asked. I have never had a problem with the service. In fact, I've experienced a friendly, inviting environment.   On an unrelated note, I recently discovered Rock Lobster's bento box lunches and I'm thrilled. They are affordable, fresh, and the perfect amount of food. So now this is also a favorite place to grab lunch. And I didn't mention this in my last review but I really like the unisex bathroom set-up. More places need to incorporate that into their design."}
{"text":"Not happy. This is not the amount or taste of food we are used to get at a teppan restaurant. First the kids in the other group got all the food. They were 7&10 how much food do you think they will eat. Oh they left most of their food on their plate. In the pic I had eaten some of the rice but the food on the plate was not touched. This is the chicken and shrimp. Our bill with appetizers and drinks was 171$ which I don't mind if the food is worth it. We were so disappointed. I have pics."}
{"text":"Love this place! I bought a groupon and my friend and I drove from AVondale (we wanted to get out of the west valley for once) and drove to chandler to eat here and it was sooo worth it! Very clean, trendy, food was delicious and presentable! The staff was super friendly and I definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Not much of sushi eater, but this was delicious. I would definitely come back. The decor is pleasing to the eye and had a set style. The music didn't really match the ambiance, which kind of threw me off. I ended up getting really cold toward the end; next time I am bringing a sweater. The waiter was great. He never let my water cup go empty (I drink a lot of water), gave us all the time we needed, and had an overall positive demeanor."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the home2suites and walked here for dinner.  My thoughts?  1.  It's convenient to the hotel considering we are out here in the middle of nowhere.  Would I make an effort to eat here if I had to drive?  Probably not.  2.  The food was ok.  I had a nigiri assortment: yellowtail, tuna, salmon, and scallops.  The salmon was the best, and I could have done without the scallops.  But with happy hour prices at $4, it was worth trying.  I also had the Korean ribs appetizer. I LOVE Korean ribs, but these were not my favorite and wouldn't order again.  3.  Service?  Meh.  They weren't slow, but somewhat inattentive.  Perhaps busier in other parts of the restaurant vs the bar, although I'm not too sure what the 2 girls behind the bar did when the gentleman was the one running around everywhere.    4.  Ambience - nice!  They had great music and a pretty nice location that was clean and inviting.  Overall?  Ok, but not mind blowing."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and great costumer service. Only complaint is the limited seating and close together table setting."}
{"text":"Incredible food and service. The happy hour specials are so worth it. The sushi was fresh. The presentation was amazing. Service was prompt and friendly. All around a great experience for us. The flavors were very good and when we had questions about certain fish they brought out a sample for us to try. We really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere and would highly recommend this place to anyone in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"We came here for tappenyaki for a birthday. The food was excellent, and that is why they got 3 stars, but you don't go for just the food. There was no show at all, the chef simply cooked our food table side. He also was mad that we didn't give him applause for cooking table side without any show. The fried rice was just egg and rice, no chicken. Last and least important, while they asked if we are there for a special occasion, they didn't acknowledge it in any way. I personally will not come back, you pay a heavy premium for eatting here and it is simply not worth it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice.  The waiter was inattentive.  After we finished our dinner he wandered off and made himself scarce for about 15 minutes - I had to ask the bus girl to get our check.  The food was just ok - overpriced - this place is located in Ocotillo and quite a drive.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"TUM favourite Rock Lobster just got a new outpost in Kensington Market right across from Agave y Aguacate. Talk about two dangerous combinations! They just opened on Friday so RUN kids, don't walk before all of the foodies start hoarding this as their new crack den.   VIBE  The owner Matt is super nice and chatty! The setup is cute too. Lots of lobster traps adorn the stall (read: there's nowhere to sit but there is a back area I believe...I didn't get to check it out). A little mirror showcases the specials of the day.   I ATE There are a few more choices here. I opted for the lobster taco (one for $5; two for $8). And man, that lobster is fresh out of the sea! Actually, Matt imports his lobster from Halifax and New Brunswick so it's the best of the best. Nice and light for a hot summer day. And yes, it's hot inside that area.  You can now get your trusty lobster roll as well with chips and a pickle for $10. Mmmm. I need personal delivery service!  I told him he needs to set up a lemonade stand and get some fresh drinks in a la Stockyards and he said it was a great idea. I'm holding him to it!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  This lobster is \"rocking\" my world. A great inventive concept in the world of Toronto street eats. I'm excited to see how Rock Lobster grows and fully support those who take a risk and make their passion happen."}
{"text":"So, we had tried many months back to dine here. When we came in the first time the place was packed and there was a waiting list. We decided to go elsewhere and try again at another time.  I made reservations about a month ago for my daughters Sweet 16th. Party of 5. Arrived Friday the 15th at 7:15 PM. Had originally requested the teppanyaki table, but after looking at the menu and prices, we decided to just dine at a regular table. Better menu with more options!   Server was the head manager. He was pleasant & service was good. The restaurant in general wasn't busy. Many open tables with no wait time, wasn't crowded at all. Seemed our waiter and another female server (assisting him) had a better connection & chemistry than the tables they were providing serves for! LOL  *There are two different sets of pricing on the menu. Happy Hour (red) & Regular pricing (black).*  Started with the spicy garlic edamame & chicken wings. The edamame was very tasty. Wings average, could have been sauced more in my opinion . We had the Asian & Hot. Super disappointing - we got 5 wings (one each) for $9.99. The happy hour price is a half order so, either 2 or 3 wings, for $5?! Regardless very expensive! Calamari same thing, very pricey for the portion $9 for about 9 small pieces and half of that amount @ happy hour for $5? Rip off!   Small salad was a fair amount for the price, but not dressed enough. It's a Asian Sesame Dressing in which I would have preferred the fresh ginger dressing that is served at the teppanyaki table. That is what I requested from our server, yet didn't receive. BTW: EVERYTHING  came out on small square white dessert style plates.  Ordered 5 rolls off the sushi menu. K.I.G, Popp'in, Eel Cucumber, Caterpillar, & Dragon Roll. All were beautifully presented, yet just the norm in taste. Steep in cost & lacked in outstanding flavor. The stand out for us was the Popp'in with small bits of  tempura shrimp on top drizzled in a sweet sauce.  Chicken Yakisoba was probably the best value. It was mediocre.  A dessert of what looked to be fried tempura ice cream was complementary presented to the Birthday Girl. It was ok. Reminded us of a Spanish fried ice cream.  Was so wanting to really like this place. Great location and cool atmosphere: plus great decor. Hoped for this location to be a \"stand out\" & \"set apart\" from other sushi places we've experienced . Unfortunately, for us it just didn't."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places in the area.  Great lunch specials, I've enjoyed every type of bento box (except salmon) and the spicy tuna bowl.  I even occasionally get a hamburger.  OF course I always start with a roll or two.  My all time favorite is the Blazing Thunder and they frequently have special rolls dependent on the season.  Specials every day so it doesn't matter which day I go because I know I will get a bit of a discount.  I've been a couple times to dinner and it is usually busy so I do stick to the quieter lunch hour to relax."}
{"text":"Wow! Where do I begin?!   The atmosphere was relaxing, laid back, with a touch of some social interaction The servers Engrid and Kaylin, Sushi Chef Abel, and General Manager Tony were AWESOME. It was all about making sure we were taken care of and our food was tasty. It seems like their mission was to make sure I enjoyed my time there and love their food. Which I have to say I loved the food! Before I speak about the food let me add that every single one of the people mentioned even Abel, would ask not just if everything was doing great, but if I needed anything. Also Tony has top notch hospitality. Honestly all of them do. It amazes me because I like to sit down and observe how people interact and work and sometimes you can tell that some servers only do their specific tables (and if they don't have customers it's taken as free time until next customer walks in) and Manager usually just comes by to say hi how's the food tasting? Not here! Not in this restaurant. All of them were working together. That's how I got the pleasure to meet each one. I really enjoyed the teamwork and wanting to make sure we had a great experience. Now on to the food. The hubby ordered hot wings and sea-bass sashimi. My son ordered a shrimp quesadilla from the restaurant next door. (Side note: restaurant next door is owned by the same owner.) I ordered a Rainbow roll with spicy tuna inside and I asked Sushi Chef Abel if he could surprise me with a cooked sushi. For dessert we ate Lava Cake. Now let me say that I tried every single item with the excuse that I needed to taste the food so I could review it for Yelp. Lol. I'm not sure my husband or my son were buying it, but either way it worked. Yay score! More food! Anyway there is nothing I can say bad about the food the sushi and raw fish was so fresh and delicious. The chicken hot wings were juicy and saucy (perfect amount). The shrimp quesadilla was so big that we had leftovers. Not only was it a decent size, but in each bite there was shrimp and cheese. Ever get a shrimp quesadilla and you take a bite and no shrimp? Oh the horror! The lava cake was moist, but firm, sweet, and chocolatey (I don't think that's a word, but you get the idea). I want to add it was a real lava cake. Not some chocolate cake with a soft chocolate center. No sir, not here! With each spoonful chocolate lava oozing out of the center. So you may ask what is the number one thing you enjoyed the most? And I say all! Customer service? 5 stars! Atmosphere? 5 stars! Food? 5 stars!   You have to stop by my review doesn't do it's justice.     Abel sushi chef  Tony general manager   Engrid server/waiter  Kaylin server/waiter"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this place! The vine/decor and service were great. My husband and I went on a Sunday for lunch (which happened to be happy hour all day!!) and got chicken eggrolls, 3 sushi rolls, and a sapporo for $22....and it was fresh and delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The HH is amazing!   I  the blue margarita and the Popin Roll is a must try!  Two  for this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Stunning skies still visible from the inside, the open patio warm and inviting as well; this restaurant has a unique feel and layout that is clearly an interior designers dream. The bonbori float at different heights making this sing traditional Japanese. You are greeted with a tempanyaki style grill right as you enter so that the sizzle and aromatic food assaults you. The rice is served simply, almost classicly. I had diced kallimari steaks which is a first for me. I usually have had everything. Offering a juicy novel style of squid that was not crunchy, chewing or classic people's opinion on squid. This was perfectly prepared. The sauces served with it vary in flavour giving a great lunch deal. I also enjoyed the veggies that were perfectly seared while even ny lady could not resist the caramelized onions next to it and she is not a big onion person. The hostess was knowledgeable enough to know her fish without having to look at the menu which is usually frustrating at other places. This place is making a great first impression. I hope to come back and enjoy the same elegance and flair."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Came here to redeem a groupon for sushi. My boyfriend and I spit yellowtail nigiri, a spicy tuna roll, the KIG roll and a Vegas roll. Plenty of food between the two of us. The KIG roll was a real highlight while the other sushi was just ok. I thought the rice was a bit on the chewy side and took away from the taste. My boyfriend also ordered a miso soup which was expensive ($3.50) but tasty. Not sure I would return unless it was on happy hour (every day 3-6) as the rolls are pretty pricey. Without the groupon we spent $47 on lunch not including tip which was steep for the quality."}
{"text":"The food was really good here, but the service was slow.  A group of 7 of us went for Valentine's Day, and wound up waiting longer for drinks than we did food.  We had to ask where are drinks were and often saw our server just hanging out at the bar.  It was a little frustrating, but hopefully with another try it will be better."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed the most wonderful evening!  The food was awesome and the Chef was perfect. .....We loved the Sake Bomb!  The Kieran beer was just so-so until you pour the Sake in ....And then, wonderful taste. We loved it!  I think that the Chef was perfect and even made the food taste better by his personality!  We will be there again!"}
{"text":"Groupon purchased. Went during happy hour/prices comparable to Groupon. Duh. First time here. The Popper roll was amazing. Chimichanga Roll had soggy rice, ugh. Sent it back and got the roll with beef it was just ok, again soggy rice. I didn't try the Teppanyaki but it looked good. Beautiful location and restaurant. The sushi rice needs help."}
{"text":"This place is pretty pricey but how crappy the sushi is .. the salmon was slimy I'm actually kind of scared I'm goin to get food poisoning... also kinda annoyed that we couldn't use on Groupon in happy hour items I've never heard of that every being a thing ... and the service sucked for $50 bucks I could of went to sushi San or ninja and got all you can eat sushi .. and the sushi is way better ! Don't waste you money here."}
{"text":"We went to check this place out on a Groupon.  The food was delicious!  We sat around a teppanyaki table and it was right at the entrance.  Felt awkward and cramped.  The chef was pretty good.  The server was not super friendly.  I'd probably choose Benihana over this place for the money and service."}
{"text":"Good sushi, some of our favorite rolls in the Valley. The patio is great 8 months out of the year. Service is usually pretty good. Had an issue tonight that was my fault (I accidentally ordered the wrong roll) which the server handled well but the expediter was kind of rude about. He needs to remember that it's all about service! We'll be back though!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place all around  Indoor outdoor vibe and decor made me feel like I was on vacation.  The food was good and for happy hour reasonably price for how delicious it was. Forgot to take a picture for the yelp, it was that good. Chris R. Was our server and he was equally wonderful.   Thanks Chris"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to treat her grandparents out to a nice dinner experience and decided to give Rock Lobster a shot. The ambiance and decor inside is superb. The K.I.G. specialty roll was definitely my favorite. Unfortunately, teppan was disappointing - I ordered the NY Strip and my wife ordered chicken. Both our meats weren't seasoned at all and had no flavor, especially the chicken.   Our sub-par teppan experience could have been entirely due to the chef. This was our grandparents first time doing teppan so they were very captivated by the aspect of it. At the end, our grandmother clapped for the chef, to which he rudely replied, \"Don't clap. Just give me money.\" I'm not one to talk bad about people, so I'll just leave it at that."}
{"text":"This is such a great place for sushi and teppan. Atmosphere is attractive and the food is of the highest quality.   A real gem Rock Lobster"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time during happy hour (3-6:30 every day!). First thing we noticed was how nicely the place was designed and decorated- very modern and cool. The rolls on happy hour averaged about ~7 per roll and they were really delicious. Our server, Heather, was very nice and friendly, and we really appreciated that our water glasses were never empty. Overall the service was excellent, the sushi rolls were tasty unique flavor combinations, and the atmosphere was hip and modern."}
{"text":"I was here the other day with some friends and our server was Ashley and I have to say she made the entire experiance extremely enjoyable. Having delicous food is that much more enjoyable when the atmosphere is right and she went above and beyond to  make sure ours was perfect. She was always smiling and quick to crack a joke with our table making us feel like it was family serving us. The next time we come back we will definetly be requesting to sit in her section again."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I went there for dinner about a year and a half ago and didn't think the Teppan-Yaki was that great, they didn't really put on much of a show and there wasn't much seasoning on the food so I've stuck with my favorite restaurant since then.   My wife picked up a Groupon for Rock Lobster so I thought, heck, let's give them another try. We got the lunch bento boxes for what seemed like a normal price of $10 or $12 or so each.   My wife had the salmon and  said it was pretty good, I had the Korean barbecue which was OK... A little dry and only about 3 ounces I think. The soup was room temperature, but they replaced it promptly and the service team was very nice. However, when I was ready to use a Groupon, they let me know that the lunch prices were considered a special and I couldn't use my Groupon... What? I would've ordered differently if I knew I couldn't use my $30 Groupon. We've used Groupon a lot and that's the first time that's ever happened. The Manager never came over to talk with us, but his solution was to charge us for all the items in our Bento box separately a la carte so we could use our Groupon. So our bento boxes, water and one beer cost almost $42 for lunch.  Soooo yeah, I'm probably not going back."}
{"text":"I came here while in the area and was happy to find a sushi place with awesome reviews! I left a little disappointed however due to the size of my rolls. Frankly I feel this place has a great vibe and nice decor. The service was also prompt and courteous. I ordered 2 rolls and they were so small I left kinda hungry because I didn't want to order a 3rd roll. Mind you, I usually am fine with 1 roll. I started with the California special, it was tasty but small. Next I ordered the ultimate shrimp tempura and that was quite delicious as well but also tiny. I felt presentation overall could've been a little better especially for the Butterfish sashimi my gf ordered. She also mentioned the Chimichanga roll was pretty good. For the price I don't think it was worth it in my opinion but I can see how if most people go during HH it might be a great value for what you are getting. Perhaps I will go during HH next time. They have some pretty unique rolls and lots of options almost daily for Happy hour so definitely give them a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night.  Service wasn't great. Food took forever to come out.  I didn't get napkin and silverware till my meal was cold.  The food itself was good and the atmosphere is really nice.  Just wish they hired more cooks and servers.  To boot, they automatically add gratuity to the bill.  I would have given 10%, not 20%."}
{"text":"My husband and I always go to RA sushi, but discovered this place close to our home and are SUPER impressed. Not only are the rolls some of the BEST we've ever had, but their happy hour deals are top notch.   Highly recommend the Poppin roll and the edamame. Yum! The only issue we had was that their menu was not very clear when it came to happy hour prices. Each section of the menu had a star next to \"happy hour priced\" items, but it wasn't very clear if it was half off, $5 off, or some other discount. We had to ask the waitress more than once because we got confused. When the older couple next to us ordered, they were confused as well as we overheard a lengthy Q&A session between them and their waiter.  Other than a menu redesign (which my local company would be happy to help with: www.stiltzmedia.com), we were very happy with our visit and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi & live music by Chad Gregory! Customer service was good too. Enjoyed happy hour on a Sunday - Rose Roll & crunchy roll & fresh wasabi were all fabulous!"}
{"text":"Date night at a new place is frightening for my husband but he let me pick this time and was astonished at the taste experience. We had a wonderful late Saturday night meal and got some exciting happy hour specials as well. Hands down the Poppin roll is a new favorite of ours with the shrimp and scallop tossed in a delicious sweet and spicy sauce. (Thought my husband was going to lick the plate clean lol)  I love how the business experiments with flavors and concoctions, we also had coconut shrimp that was fantastic. Drinks though had some alcohol but not too overwhelming so I was happy with choices. I would recommend Aloha Sunrise and Chili Mango. This place felt so comfortable and the staff made us feel so welcome even being one of the last customers to leave."}
{"text":"We were so lucky to get an early mother's day reservation and although we were sat about 30 min late, by the time we got out cook, Hugh, who was hilarious, we were certainly in the right hands. This refreshed out look on teppaniki grill, our meal was perfection, and I personally ate every last morsel on my plate- as did the other folks at my table! We even gave the cook a huge tip! I will be back over and over and over! So pleased!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Geoffrey was a great chef and very entertaining! We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  I decided to try this place due to a special on their website for Thursday's  - Beat the heat...or something like that where you get discounts based on how high the temp was that day. When I arrived, I was told they no longer are doing that special. It's still on the website. I think it was a little deceiving."}
{"text":"Best teppan show ever!!! Our cook was hilarious and had lots of adult humor!  Staff: super attentive  Atmosphere: super sexy, beautiful, hip. This restaurant has the best vibe I have ever had in a Japanese steak house. Very chic and open, I loved the open windows and doors.  Food: SCALLOPS: tasty, good portions           SHRIMP app: decent sized shrimp        and well seasoned          MISO SOUP: kinda cold when I got it          SALAD: great dressing          SAUCES: both were mediocre"}
{"text":"The sushi.... yum! Spicy tuna rolls are my fave! I would also highly suggest The dirty south roll, the dragon roll and the crunchy roll is always good. I like the Philly roll but it's a pretty thick one, not everyone likes having to eat a slice in 2 bites;) the atmosphere is so elegant, great for a lunch with the ladies."}
{"text":"First time visit on Sunday (about 12:20)after we tried 2 rolls (Dragon & Strawberry-good as expected) we wanted to try something \"fried\"and our waiter recommended a roll and he took our order for that \"Fried\" Roll.  Because it was now after 1:30, our one \"Fried\" roll literally came to our table 30 minutes later.  I noted to the (different) waitress that our order of one \"fried\" roll (6 pieces) took 30 minutes.  She replied, I'll see if we can take this off your bill.  We've now spent almost 2 hours in the restaurant with only one wait staff checking on us as I asked yet another waitress for our bill.  I noted that the previous waitress mentioned that the \"fried\" roll would be \"taken off our bill\".  Her reply was \"Who told you that?\"  I described the waitress and was told that she is not even a server and that she could not make those type of decisions.  I wondered \"Well, who the Hell is serving us then?\" All in all, never go there during a busy time because you might just get served your one Fried roll 30-45 minutes later by someone whose not really a server!! So Rock Lobster-go crawl under a rock-bad service-rude workers.  No worries Rock Lobster-I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"The sushi is absolutely amazing. Every roll we had was great. The atmosphere is open and inviting. It's small but we got there at 6 pm and there were plenty of seats. The other reviews are right about the service. Our waiter was hard to find and didn't seem to really be into us. The food though made up for the service."}
{"text":"We had been craving Teppanyaki and wanted to check this place out so we went for their power hour. They have two griddles in the center of the restaurant when you first walk in, but they were only going to be having one 'show' that night. They decided they could squeeze us in and sat us in front of the griddle that was not going to be used. ) The whole table had 22 seats, and all but 5 were occupied so it was disappointing that they didn't have both griddles going. It also made the dinner service extra slow since one guy was cooking so much.  I am allergic to shrimp, and usually the places we go to are willing to do the shrimp last or at least off to the side. ( I only ever get the veggies and tofu and its usually done well before anything else.) This place was not accommodating though-- which is fine since they were so busy-- so I just popped some benadryl and assumed that they would at least keep the stuff separate. The chef happened to put the shrimp directly touching the tofu I had ordered, which was a little annoying, there wasn't a shortage of space on the griddle at all as he hadn't started any of the other meats until after dishing out the veggies. Luckily the tofu was the worst tofu I have ever tried so i didn't even want to eat it.  It was extremely soggy and very very sugary.  My boyfriend spit out the bite that he tried as well. He had ordered the chicken and Filet for his entree, the chicken was doused in the same nasty sugar sauce that was on the tofu. The filet was very tender  though and between the two of us we did eat the whole portion of that.  The fried rice was also good, but didn't taste anything like normal fried rice, we couldn't figure out what the taste was.  The mushroom soup was okay, each bowl only had 2 impressively thin slices of mushroom in them.  The prices were fair with it being their power hour ( meaning half off all teppanyaki entrees) So is wasn't such a big deal that the food wasn't good and the portions were so small. Also, they do not have a sign saying 'rock lobster' from the street. We drove by the place twice before just driving into the complex to see if we could find it. They do have a sign, it is just facing the parking area and a dirt lot.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing! Unfortunately, the service was just sad. We waited quite awhile to be seated and there wasn't even a line....we were it. Then our server never came over as he was too busy socializing with his other table, ignoring all his other tables too. The only other server who happened to seat us was kind enough to bring us some water. We eventually handed our sushi order in to him, which he advised he would give to \"our\" server. We watched \"our\" server place the order to the side so he could continue gabbing with that same table. After now being there for 20 or so minutes, we saw him finally put in our order but never once came by to greet us or say anything until we were almost done with our food, which was brought to us by the other server who made it clear he still wasn't our server. Just crazy. Again, the sushi was amazing but that's it. So disappointed with the rest."}
{"text":"Had the teppanyaki this time and it was better but the service here is just so damn sterile!!  Great people make great restaurants. This place needs to work on that a bit."}
{"text":"Get the poppin shrimp if you're getting sushi. Dragon roll is also a classic. Their yellowtail was very fresh and good. Service was great and patio atmosphere was really nice."}
{"text":"Started off with a reservation that went a half hour late, but service and food was amazing.  We had the steak and shrimp teppanyaki, absolutely perfectly done, the chef was entertaining, with a great culinary show.  They only have 3 cooking tables, so definitely make a reservation.  By accident we made the reservation at 8pm which was half off teppanyaki meals only.  With further investigation the half off only  applies  to reservations made for exactly 5pm or exactly 8 pm so an even greater deal.  I had to ask the server to add to the bill till she explained the half off power hour! Amazing deal.  A definite must try!"}
{"text":"My first sushi spot here in Chandler. Wasn't disappointed! The sushi was good and service was very friendly. They always came to refill our waters and to check in and see if we needed anything else. We also got offered fresh wasabi, which was super delish!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far..  waiter really knows the product,  lolipop is sushi with a cucumber wrap,  n had quail egg shots..  delicious.  wife had a burger which was very good as well,  especially for a sushi place.. very clean restaurant,  knowledgable staff..  decent pricing..  next trip i got the waiters suggested cinco de mayo..  wow.  best sushi i have tried, vwill be hard to sample others n hold to comparison..  excellent spot in great area..  kudos"}
{"text":"Ever wanted to have Teppanyaki but pay half the price?!? Forget Groupon and come to Rock Lobster any day at 5pm or 8pm and have Teppanyaki at half price!!! The food was amazing. My first time here and I had the Chilean Sea Bass which was crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside while my wife had the Filet Mignon that was so tender it melted in your mouth. We will definitely be here again. See you guys at 5pm for Power Hour!!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for a year and a half and have gone here close to a dozen times.  The sushi taste great.  But the service is consistently bad.  Everything from messing my order to over charging on my bill to the latest of being seated and no one coming to my table to even take a drink order for 15min.  I've had meals comped a few times by the manager and the staff is always apologetic when they mess up.  I believe they want to do it right but the place is so poorly run.  I hope they figure it out because this place could be nice."}
{"text":"My guy and I work at Intel right down to the street and we decided to try this place for lunch. I haven't been here since it was the Sushi Room. Pretty much same decor and same vibe.  We both ordered bento boxes, mine was the Korean BBQ and his was the salmon served with white rice as well. The miso soup was a very generous serving and wasn't too salty. The bento came with a very tasty and perfectly spiced squid salad, mixed greens and a 3 piece California roll. My lunch was very tasty the beef was very flavorful and super charbroiled just the way I like it. His salmon was tasty with a glaze and we both finished our meals. Not much to complain about food wise. There is a patio and we enjoyed the weather before the tough AZ summer hits. The service was fine, the girls were attentive and our water glasses were never empty.  I am trying this place this week for HH so let's see how it goes! Might be a little more fun and crowded as it was kind of sparse during lunch."}
{"text":"This is out first and last time at Rock Lobster.  The staff was friendly and the sushi was good...but they need help in HOW to treat customers.  We sat down and had a full conversation before anyone came by and said \"hi\".  And when she did, she had no menus, no water, and was not prepared.  Uh, yeah...we'd like menus...  The food took 35 minutes to get to us...and then it was one piece at a time."}
{"text":"So ridiculously yummy.  We ordered three rolls, two new ones and my favorite deep fried eel and cream cheese goodness.  The other two rolls We're so good that my go to was my least favorite.  One had the smallest perfect bite of lemon while the other had a baked shrimp in a red sauce - I don't remember their names but I'm so excited to go back, I already purchased a groupon"}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon a month ago which initially brought me to Rock Lobster in the first place.  My bf and I have been here twice, once sitting outside on the patio and once dining inside.  Both areas provide an inviting atmosphere to mingle with small and larger groups.  Rock Lobster has great daily specials, and ironically, I didn't use the Groupon for either visit because the daily specials were a better deal.  The sushi rolls are delicious, however, imo, there are too many cream cheese options, (those I haven't tried).  The vegetable tempura is somewhat salty, but I would definitely order it again.  The prices are very fair and the staff is fun and friendly. I know that we will inevitably use the Groupon- holding on to it is an excuse to return to Rock Lobster; I know we will.  When my family/friends visit from out of town, I plan on bringing them here."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday in January.   I wanted teppanyaki and been wanting to try this place for some time.  It was kinda of quiet since my birthday fell on a Monday but the food and presentation was very good.  I ordered a delicious martini called Red dragon.  Return factor is high."}
{"text":"I was craving teppanyaki so we bought a Groupon for Rock Lobster.   Walking in, I like the ambiance of the place. It is small inside, but nicely decorated.  There seems to be only certain times the grill is available.  We arrived at 5:30 to an empty grill, but the hostess wasn't sure we would be able to eat without reservations.  We were a party of two.  She goes to ask someone else, maybe manager, and we are sat at the grill.  Akward.  Look over the menu next, and I have a bit of sticker shock.  We usually eat at Osaka, which is closer to us, but figured it would be about the same price, even less with a groupon.  Wrong.  The food was fine, it was standard for a teppanyaki experience, but nothing I felt that justified the increased price.  They even charge extra for fried rice.  The serving I felt was smaller than other places too.  I gave some stars for service and atmosphere, but next time I will stick with what I know."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment from a place with great reviews. This was on a list of places I wanted to try before heading back to Washington. I brought my dad and his girlfriend here for dinner and they were also unimpressed.  The prices reflect the atmosphere but not the quality. Everything looked nice except it was too dark and my dad and his girlfriend had a hard time reading the menu so I gave them my phone with the flashlight on. The server took a while to get to us and then took some time to get us water. I was looking at their specialty rolls and they were all spicy except for 4 out of the 14. I don't mind spicy but I know my dad isn't really into it.   We ended up ordering vegetable tempura, strawberry butterfish, truffle surf & turf, dragon roll, soft shell crab roll, and some sweet shrimp. The vegetable tempura was basic, strawberry butterfish was sour, truffle surf & turf was good but not worth $16, both the dragon and soft shell crab roll was rolled poorly and the taste was meh to not good, and the sweet shrimp did not taste fresh. Overall the rolls were small portions which did not match the price or the quality. They also didn't include any wasabi or ginger so we had to ask for some.  I also find it baffling when the server doesn't know what's on the menu. I asked for a Rockrita and she was so confused. Kept asking me to repeat myself and then said she didn't know what it was. I pointed it out on the menu and she put in the order. The Rockrita is supposed to have fruit infused tequila and a raspberry float. It definitely was not that. It tasted and looked like a typical lime margarita that I paid $10 for.  Really bummed to have spent $80+ and all of us leaving dissatisfied and hungry still."}
{"text":"Great service - showed up at 730 without a reservation and sat outside with a group of six on a Saturday. We had all of the appetizers and the Korean beef and coconut shrimp were the best. The sushi was good - the best was the spicy tuna roll. The teriyaki chicken arrived cold but they were kind enough to remove it from the bill. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is 3.5.  There are some things I liked about it but there were also some things that I did not care for. The place is pretty loud and kind of cramped. The decor was kind of interesting I like the lights.   It took a while for them to bring us our drinks. The timing of the rest of the meal seemed really off.  They brought my roll before they brought the appetizer. The food was pretty good, but not outstanding.   I guess it is all right if you live in south Chandler and there's not other sushi places around, but I can think of some others that I would be willing to drive farther to go to."}
{"text":"Sushi was great. Got the KIG and wicked rolls. Great quality and good prices. Next time we will have to try the teppan haji!"}
{"text":"I had visited Rock Lobster when it was named the Sushi Room--I'm happy to say it is just as good as I remembered, actually better than I remember! They've added teppanyaki tables so we decided to give it a shot. The chef was amazing, the food was fantastic, the fried rice was delicious (it tasted fresh and smelled as good as it taste.) An added plus was that we were sat near a couple of friendly people that we made friends with.    Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This sushi place has a great location although I have to admit it's fairly small, but very clean and has friendly staff. However the sushi rolls were great, I had the chimichanga roll and my wife tried the California special. We also tried the Kirin light beer with a warm Sake and a Sangria glass of wine. I was very impressed with the sushi rolls & the drinks at the place.   On the other hand I was absolutely disappointed with the teppanyaki grill, I ordered the chicken & shrimp with fried rice. The chef only gave me 7 small shrimp (and gave away like 8 shrimp to 4 different people who did not order shrimp at all) even after I tipped the chef with $10. The chicken was honestly tasteless, no flavor! And the rice to say the least was just plain, nothing to be exited about. A$20 worth meal, that just went to waste.  I'll probably go again and have the sushi rolls and try something else, but definitely not sit at the grill table anymore. The prices are fairly decent, exempt for the teppanyaki combos, and the portions are smaller than I expected."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant with a Groupon. Unfortunately, you can't use a Groupon with happy hour. We decided to do happy hour first then try again with the Groupon. My husband really enjoyed the sushi. I am vegetarian and don't eat fish, so I got a veggie roll and a bowl of stir fry veggies. I was disappointed, the stir fry veggies were not especially flavorful, the serving was small and definitely not worth the price. I ended up asking if they could make me an avocado roll, it wasn't on the menu, but they did. The service was excellent, but I wasn't impressed with the food. I opted out of his next trip. He used the whole $30 Groupon and ended up having to pay more and said he didn't really feel satisfied after. Later that day he was sick. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Great happy hour! We came here on a Friday night was pretty busy but the server was able to take care of us and give us a awesome expierence for our first time here. Atmosphere is very nice as well. Love the jelly fish in the tank."}
{"text":"One of the more extensive happy hour offerings....plenty of choices to make sushi and non-sushi lovers happy.    Everything we ordered was good quality and fresh tasting.  The restaurant has a nice vibe and cool decor.  Parking can be a little tight if you arrive too late but had an overall good experience.  This will be a regular stop on our happy hour circuit."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour specials! Tried something completely different,the chimichunga roll-Soo tasty! The coconut  shrimp was practically a desert with the sweet coconut sauce. Service was slow but the sushi was delish. I also used a groupon which helped Out bc it is a little pricy if you didn't go during happy hour"}
{"text":"So I've been to this place a few times when it was called the Sushi Room.   The first time I came everything was amazing. They had a lot of specialty rolls that I really enjoyed and we even ordered this fish bowl drink that was to die for! I bought a groupon for sushi room a few months ago so my friend and I decided to take advantage. Well we couldn't use our groupon since it was happy hour and their entire menu had changed. The waitress had no idea what I was talking about when I asked about the sushi or drinks I had.   So I came back again a few weeks ago to try to use the groupon again during a weekday. And what happened? We got there at 8:45 and they close at 9. Um what!?  So I finally returned again for the third time to use my groupon since it was expiring...I ordered the Montpellier Pinot noir wine. For sushi we ordered the Kig, philly roll and the salmon nigiri. The service was extremely slow. We got our food before our drinks. And they didn't get our salmon roll correct.  We were there during the week and didn't even leave until around 9:30 and it was still quite busy. Yet last time I showed up at 8:45 we got shooed away. The sushi was mediocre but I won't be back after so many failed attempts."}
{"text":"Great place to relax and have some sushi at.  You can either choose the sushi side only or sit at the Tempanyaki bar and have a show put on for you.  Great staff great location which makes it a great time every visit.  Always are go to spot when craving sushi"}
{"text":"Excellent Teppan and sushi place. The chef was hilarious and definitely made it worthwhile. The shrimp and steak are very good. I got adventurous and tried the calamari, but it was bland - maybe that's what it tastes like - I had never tried it before. The sushi rolls are very tasty - I especially like the Boom Boom roll and the Chimichanga roll, but several others I've tried are very good too. If you can catch one of their living social deals for the teppan dinner for 2 it is a great deal. The service we have received has been good. We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Teppan at Rock Lobster is so amazing, as is the sushi, the menu items, drinks, the service and the people!"}
{"text":"While my brother was visiting back in April, he and my husband brought me here for lunch. It's really close to my job and I'm a big sushi eater so I was excited. I had seen they had a Groupon however the details weren't explicitly stated so I didn't want to chance it and purchase the Groupon and have them tell me it's only for certain menu items or only valid for 2 people or what have you but I should have just purchased it. It was lunch time and fairly busy, our waitress was friendly but our food took a little while to come out. My husband ordered his go-to egg rolls, my brother ordered a sushi lunch special, and I ordered a spicy salmon bowl.  It was more tangy than spicy and I wasn't a big fan of the sauce. My husband did like his egg rolls and the sweet thai chili dipping sauce that they came with. I don't remember exactly which rolls my brother ordered but they were very average. He definitely didn't have any complaints but they weren't the best rolls he'd ever have. I remember feeling that the bill was high for the quality of meal we'd receive but service was great and it's a really cute restaurant with outdoor seating for not too hot days. I'd give Rock Lobster another try but only during happy hour or with a Groupon."}
{"text":"When I flew into Phoenix for work I immediate went to Yelp to see where was a great place to grab dinner that was close to my hotel. This place had great reviews, it was right across from my hotel, and it looked like they offered a wide selection of sushi. I walked in and noticed two employees at the bar chitchatting look up at me and went right back to their conversation. Another waitress walked right by me and didn't even acknowledge me. I was about to walk out and go next door when a girl asked if I had been helped which I replied, \"no\". She asked how many to which I said it was just me. She told me to sit anywhere so I picked a table next to the garage door opening. I sat for another 10 minutes when my waitress finally came to greet me. She explained the menu regarding \"Happy Hour.\"  I wasn't sure what I wanted so I asked for more time while she went and got my drinks. Another 10 minutes later she came back, without my drink, and finally took my order. I gave her all I wanted and waited for my food. The food came fairly quickly and almost all at once. I ordered the tempura battered calamari which came with a great dipping sauce. The special California roll was nothing special. It just looked like a dressed up California roll, nothing to exciting. I also ordered chicken katsu with a side order of veggies and rice which was okay. The chicken katsu was over cooked and lacked flavor. I don't know if they seasoned the chicken at all. The grilled veggies were mediocre, again no seasoning or taste. The presentation was nice and my server came and checked on me a couple of times but wasn't personable or engaging. It wasn't busy during the time I was there so I didn't understand the lack of service. I was also shocked at my bill!  I figured it would be cheaper since it was during happy hour and two of the things I ordered were suppose to be half off.  It wasn't!  I wasn't too impressed with the place."}
{"text":"We had a nice Sushi dinner here last night. Great variety of rolls and delicious tempura ice cream dessert (perfect to split). Although the patio is gorgeous for our amazing weather in AZ the manage or owner should be aware of how dirty the white walls are. Our booth looked like someone has a field day with soy sauce splattered all over the wall. Details like this shouldn't be missed At the end of every shift. A bucket of hot water and bleach and it will come off. I messaged the business I hope they clean up the patio."}
{"text":"Sushi is good but I think it was that good enough to be back. The sushi did taste a little dry and not fresh as I would of like it to be. The appetizer portions are very small in comparison to the price. Service is excellent! Our waiter was super friendly made great recommendations and made us feel very welcomed. I would only come back here for happy hour if anything."}
{"text":"Tonight we had our first real sushi focused dinner.  It was amazing!  What an absolutely wonderful meal.  The food was great and the service was awesome.  Great atmosphere.  Was fun to be in a \"Japanese\" restaurant that was playing Reggae music.  I will warn you that most of the food had some spicy heat.  Not being a sushi expert I do not know if that is normal.  It was great but be prepared for some spice."}
{"text":"I flew all the way from Washington DC to have Rock lob roll. Their food and there service is amazing... can wait to come back again.... Ah Tony thank you for everything...."}
{"text":"This place is entertaining and fun.  Since I like to order special like Uni and Toro, I was disappointed that I have feared that the sushi chef had inferior skills because sweet citrus never mixed with salty item such as caviar or sea urchin.  This may NOT be known since many patrons here themselves have no expertise on Asian cuisine and it is a big no no with Japanese cooking.  I have ordered a Uni sashimi and it was served inside of a carved out orange in the shape of Mickey Mouse.  The chef did not separate the sweet juice that is leaking from the orange (he could have use the mint leave to keep the juice out.  It is like putting heavy lemon juice into a Russian Caviar.  Felt like to return it but it is so expensive so I just took but it tasted horribly together.  Other items were fine but for the highlight of the meal, this was a true setback.  Have been here for their teppanyaki show and it was entertaining..Not too crazy about the way the food taste but it was really for a show.  It is great place for a date."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! We did $30 of sushi for $15 dollars groupon but ended up spending a lot more than that. I guess that's the point. I thought the $27 for 21 sashimi deal was pretty good regardless. I could probably have taken down all that sashimi by myself, to be honest, but that's just me. The sashimi was good! Not the best I've ever had but definitely good. The strawberry roll was very cool."}
{"text":"Their happy hour rolls were the size of regular rolls (unlike some sushi happy hours!) and they were all delicious. They also have good happy hour drink specials. We enjoyed every roll we tried but especially loved their Surfer roll. The spicy edamame and fresh wasabi are also musts. The place is well decorated and the service was attentive and friendly. I am curious about the Tepan portion of the restaurant - both tables were full and it seemed popular as well. Once those condos behind this place are finished being built I am sure Rock Lobster will be hard to get into!"}
{"text":"First time here after getting up and leaving the table without ordering at Hon Machi Sushi (that review later). The Sushi Room is now Rock Lobster, same restaurant, new name. We went on Sunday, which happened to be Happy Hour. It included rolls, drinks, appetizers. Presentation of sushi rolls was excellent, food was fantastic, and service was great. Atmosphere was very nice! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time today. We happened to come at happy hour so we got 4 rolls, 2 appetizers, a beer, ice tea and a soda for $68. Service was fast. We loved the poppin roll and the chimichanga roll. I think we will be back. I hear Mondays the rolls are all half price. Awesome place go if you are over here."}
{"text":"The only reason I give them a 3 is because i ADORED them as sushi room and miss some of the dishes they served .  But I will say that the service and the food was really good.   The lollipop roll was layers upon layers of flavors    from the ahi to the ponzo was all very well done .   Will definitely go back !"}
{"text":"I have been here again since my last visit and service was impeccable! I'm very happy because the sunshine roll is one of my favorite rolls in the city!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Chandler. The service is great, the servers are super friendly, and the food is AMAZING.   I've been there quite a few times and have tried a lot of their menu. The teppanyaki is delicious! I highly suggest the shrimp, scallops and the fried rice....everything was seasoned to perfection. Their sushi is among the best I've had in AZ. My favorite is the KIG roll. I will definitely be returning to Rock Lobster."}
{"text":"Got the steak and chicken grill combo. The chef was awesome and very nice. The steak tasted great but the chicken was a little bland. My fiance ordered some sushi and it tasted really fresh. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I love this place.  My son had the orange chicken and loved it.  My daughter had a chicken terraki bento box plate.  My mom and I had the rock burger.  We each ordered sushi.  Food was great.  Service was even better.  I'll definetly be back."}
{"text":"Great food great sushi different show from other teppanyaki places. Service was excellent and great music too. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a travel zoo voucher. It was a great way to find out about Rock lobster. It is a really nice and accommodating place. Great experience and food was really good. It is a bit small so I would recommend a reservation."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Teppan I have ever had. Beautiful decor, huge delicious portions and wonderful wait staff. Geoffrey, our chef was great! A place to definitely come back to, and we will! What a wonderful way to spend our anniversary!!"}
{"text":"Went to Rock Lobster on a whim, had a groupon - sashimi was great, very fresh - we had the Cowgirl signature roll, and the K.I.G. roll.  Both are spicy, with a sweet finish. Loved it! Staff could look a little more happy to be there, though - I felt almost bad asking for another glass for our Kirin bomber."}
{"text":"Location: the restaurant is very well decorated, clean and welcoming. The parking area is relatively small and its located off Queen Creek and Dobson.   Service: I don't think they have a hostess. Our waiter sat us down as well as serving our table. He was attentive and checked up our table from time to time. He is the reason I gave this place a 2 stars.   Food: where should I start? I ordered 4 items off their happy hour menu: yellowtail sushi $2, salmon sushi $2, Asian chicken wings and Egg roll. I am glad that I only ordered one sushi for each because it was tasteless. When the chicken wings arrived, I asked what made it an \"Asian chicken wings\". She told me it was the sauce that made it Asians. Again, it was pretty much tasteless. The egg rolls were decent. Then, I decided to order my favorite sushi roll, Dragon roll, off the regular menu. It was definitely not worth $13. Not only the presentation isn't there, the only part that tastes decent was the Eel that was on the top of each pieces. I literally picked them off and didn't end up finishing all of it. My friend ordered a cooked Salmon dish and it was over cooked. He didn't finish his dish neither.   Rating: it is a shame that their sushi turned out the way that it did. It is closed to my house and very well decorated.  I cannot say this is the worse I've had but seriously I will not come back here for their sushi ever again. If you want authentic sushi, I highly suggest you to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great ambiance, great food. I recommend the surf n turf roll! The Teppanyaki table was great! NY Strip was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks beautiful on the outside. We sat down to eat, got served water right away. The MINUTE we told them we had a groupon, they ignored us. They took 15 mins to get drinks, brought me a flat diet coke, then the server had the absolute audacity to pour some in a different cup, taste it, and say its not flat. What in the actual f*ck? No. Then they gave me the wrong appetizer, never brought me my entree, it was horrible. Just don't go there."}
