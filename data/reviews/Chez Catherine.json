{"text":"The crepes, the chocolate and the maple syrup were wonderful!! Small place but feels authentic."}
{"text":"Ahhh, those cute little \"Chez\" places we always hear others talking about...

Well, Chez Catherine is actually Catherine's place, which she recently opened, to serve some of the best crepes and coffee we had a chance to find during our enjoyable recent stay in Montreal.  And we looked around all over and gobbled other crepes down wherever we could (we would often split one so we could then go to another place and split the next one.  Yeah, we like to eat!).

What makes Chez Catherine a five star find is a combination of pleasures that start on a strong foundation of one really friggin' good crepe!  I mean, my newly wedded wife is a yoga instructor and she commented, without a hint of hyperbole or mistaken metaphor, that these crepes had \"breath\".  And by that she meant a lightness and airy quality that is otherwise hard to describe but damn easy to taste.  And taste we did.  We came back a couple days later for seconds.  They were that good.

The other wonderful aspect is that Montreal in summer is overrun with tourists and that means inflated tourist prices as well as insensitive service, but even though Chez Catherine has a great location down by the water the prices don't gouge you for the premium location.  As well, Catherine herself is there to pamper you and also share stories about her business, including that her husband's colleague's parents retired and took up the hobby of hand making maple syrup and packaging small runs, which Catherine points out as she serves to you your maple syrup to pour over your fabulous crepe that has the breath of the good life still within it.  

Winner."}
{"text":"The crepe with Nutella and ice cream was absolutely amazing. Huge portion, I couldn't finish it! Also, the soft serve dipped in the ferro Roche was to die for. Other ice cream will pale in comparison to this place going forward!"}
{"text":"We were wandering around Vieux Montreal, and when the lunch hour arrived we decided we would try to find some delicious crepes nearby - with the help of Yelp! Chez Catherine showed up with five stars from most of its reviewers so we headed over there and had a most delicious lunch. Very fresh salad and one large crepe each -- I had asparagus, Swiss cheese and mushrooms in mine, and my consort chose ham, Swiss and mushrooms. We were both delighted with our selections, with the price, and with the service. Highly recommend. It's a casual place -- people wander in for ice cream mostly, but if you decide to sit down for a bite, you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"This place is a must!!! Best crêpes ever and the owner is super hot and friendly staff with lots of home made crêpes to choose from. I could have spent whole the day there. Stop by and you will not be disappointed if I may suggest something try the chocolate banana crêpes"}
{"text":"My mom and I fell upon this little place and loved it. We spilt a crepe filled with wonderful chocolate and banana and then a scoop of maple ice cream which was so amazing. The woman helping us we found out was the owner and she couldn't be more pleasant, helpful and kind.  She even took out a map to helpl us plan out our last day. We don't speak any French, but she was wonderful helping us in English. Definitely worth stopping by for a nice treat. Food was amazing."}
{"text":"The crepe was really good.

What's the problem then? I asked for mine to go, as I had to run back to the hotel to check out.  \"To go\" apparently means on an open paper plate you get to carry through the streets to the Metro while scarfing down a bite here and there. 

When I expressed surprise about this not being really a practical to-go package, all I got back was \"That's how we do it.\"  Crepes are really easy to wrap up in a paper triangle, which is how they've been served to me in the past.  

So... don't take it to go."}
{"text":"Service souriant et les prix sont correct malgré les touristes crêpes smoothies avec une terrasse sympa"}
{"text":"This place only takes debit cards - no credit cards.

My group was craving crepes and thought we needed to have them before we left Montreal. Amazing amazing place for crepes - they offer a bunch of different options and you can combine them. I had the strawberry nutella crepe with vanilla ice cream. Amazing! One down side is that it is a TINY place. There's barely any seating so it's not the best for large groups or if it gets crowded. It's also a bit pricey, but that's to be expected since you're in a tourist area.

We also had the chance to meet Catherine and she is absolutely my favorite person. She was so sweet and answered our obscure tourist questions about maple syrup and how natives would eat the crepes. She took the time to talk to us and brought out small tables and chairs so that we could all sit together. Loved her!"}
{"text":"The crepes here is overrated, it's just average. The service is really good and the location is good."}
{"text":"We walked over here after dinner for dessert looking for something special. One of us went with the ice cream, three of us ordered soft serve. Seventy five percent of us got something special. 

The ice cream is nothing to write home about. You'll find as good or better options just about anywhere. Don't waste your time with that.

The soft serve is the creamiest, maybe best I've ever had. I asked the gal behind the counter what the locals prefer, and without hesitation she said vanilla soft serve dipped in hazelnut sauce. It did not disappoint. The others had really good soft serve options also, but I'm not even gonna tell you about them. Just order the vanilla soft serve with hazelnut sauce. It is awesome!"}
{"text":"The best crepes Ive ever eaten and - other than an unbelievably over the top hospitable Texas rose I met one time in Austin- the nicest restaurant owner as well. Catherine is just the best, sooooooo friendly and professional and tells GREAT stories. I told her that this place is so famous in Toronto, that when I asked 3 people where should I eat, this name popped up as #1 for all three of them, and sure enough Catherine does not disappoint despite the very very high expectations. Plus it was nice to see one of my favourite Foodies tv show You Gotta Eat Here also had visited and loved it. Its the very first time in my life I was so stuffed - actually the whole family - that we needed to very unfortunately cancel the much anticipated dessert. Next time, I promise, we will leave room for dessert. Please be warned, these servings are HUGE. You should probably only order one crepe per two people. YUMMMMMMMMM :) Thank you Catherine !!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the crepe here, got one with strawberry and vanilla ice cream on top. It was a generous amount of ice cream so I was pleasantly surprised! Lovely dessert that can be shared with another person too."}
{"text":"Great ice cream. My bf and I went back just to get their soft served ice cream coated in hazelnut chocolate."}
{"text":"Chez Catherine is a wonderful little place.  The staff is always most welcoming and helpful.  The soft ice cream is delicious - it does not have that chemical-fake taste like the soft ice cream at McDonald's or DQ. The chocolate dip is real Belgian chocolate.  I don't even usually like chocolate dipped cones, but this one had me at the first bite (or lick).  The banana splits are served with real whipped cream; the strawberry sauce is made there - it is the real McCoy!  The crepes are also very tasty and all the ingredients are freshly made. They even serve with genuine plates and cutlery.  It is a treat to eat at Chez Catherine."}
{"text":"Lots of desserts and ice creams to choose from. The service was excellent and quick. The crepes and fresh berries were amazing!  The only disappoint was the soft served ice cream served with our crepes. Considering they serve real ice cream it wouldve been a better choice to go with."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to get a late night dessert prior to leaving Montreal. I found this place down in the shopping district. Very good ice cream and a great crew. They stay open late as well."}
{"text":"Mi sono trovato molto bene per la mia prima colazione. Croissant appena sfornato accompagnato da una marmellata di arance fresca, bagel con uova e verdura, un bicchiere di spremuta di arancia e un cappuccino fatto con il caffè Illy! Sarà che arrivavo dalla mattina precedente da una colazione mediocre nell'hotel di China town, ma questa mi da il buon umore. 
L'unica è che ho fatto aprire i proprietari. Alle 8:30 stavano ancora preparando il locale, ma non volevo andare dai vari McDonalds, Starbucks...
Non fanno le crèpes..."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!
Amazing Ice cream with amazing people working behind the counter!
I got vanilla soft serve dipped in chocolate"}
{"text":"Wow, purely by accident, my kids and I stumbled upon this tiny place facing the waterfront. SO glad we did!

I have extolled the crepes from Montreal for months prior to visiting, so I was quietly praying that the crepes here wouldn't disappoint. And they didn't. Whew! We ordered two meal crepes and one dessert crepe. All were fantastic: light, airy, filled just right, with excellent ingredients, with a bit of wonderful maple syrup to drizzle on top. Truly the best crepes ever. We were too full afterwards for the much-touted maple ice cream, but my kids made me promise to return for some later on in the week.

Other notes: we sat outside, which afforded us a fantastic place to people-watch and admire the waterfront and the passing caleches. Only problem: it was a sunny and hot day, with no umbrellas to shield us from the sun (as the other adjacent bistros and cafes had). One big plus, though: nice bathroom inside to use if needed. Plus, the gals that work here could NOT be nicer! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great ice cream, great milkshakes, and a patio with a view of the waterfront - a winning recipe."}
{"text":"Staff was very nice. Good ice cream and crepes. Not much in the way of seating. More of a grab and go place."}
{"text":"After having a cupcake and ice-cream at an cafe up the area of Old Montreal, I guess my craving for ice-cream was still not satisfied when I decided also check out this place.
Since it looked empty when I walked by I decided I might as well take a look inside.
Yeah, I really need more cool treats so I got a small sized milkshake with chocolate ice-cream in it. 
The unexpected twist on my order was that the place was out of small milkshake cups so my small size order was given an upgrade to a medium. I didn't say no to that gesture which meant more cool, sweet, thick milkshake to sip on while walking around the port."}
{"text":"I stopped in to this place to find a coffee, I decided to get some maple ice cream as well. The maple ice cream was unbelievable! Would highly recommend stopping by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The best ice cream... the hazelnut dip is amazing! Still thinking about it several months later.   Will definitely stop again when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Ran in the cold to get there at 8 on a sat said it was open till 11 and the doors were locked"}
{"text":"Quaint little establishment which serves great crepes with friendly service.  I had the dessert crepe with bananas and delicious maple syrup.  Reasonably priced and very easy to locate."}
{"text":"OMG I love their ice creme dipped in chocolate. I ordered a medium and it was too much even for me. tasted amazing and I cried when I had to throw the rest of it away."}
{"text":"Super nice people that helped you well. Good seating area outside and inside. The crepes are very good and filling. I recommend the nutella and banana crepe."}
{"text":"Went there for a coffee. Ordered a capacino with a sweet croissant, but she heated salted croissant. When I asked for replacement she refused. They also only accept cash and debit, not credit.

Cappacino was ok though."}
{"text":"They are really smart. They've located their dairy bar right there! So many customers! Kids and adults all want ice cream when it's beautiful outside! Simple ice cream, gelato, all kinds of sweet stuff in here, perfect for people who need something to cool them down a bit. This is not the cheapest you can get in Montreal... But not the most expensive too!!!! So come on in! Have a taste at this quality ice cream and have fun in Old Port. There's not much to say about ice cream so that's it for the review!"}
{"text":"First the obvious, if you're after ice cream or gelato, cruise the streets a bit and check out the flavors available. Get a few free tastes, especially of the \"house specials.\" We did the same, and one thing we found was that not every shop had well-frozen product. The last thing you need is ice cream already on its way to ice cream soup. We checked out Chez Catherine, and they almost dared us to try their Maple Taffy flavor. If you love maple syrup, maple flavor, this will knock your socks off! I had the Maple Taffy and Rum Raisin, scooped into a waffle cone. My wife got the Maple Taffy plus a scoop of Mint Chocolate, to sort of tame the sweetness of the Maple. The ice cream was good and firm, well frozen, and we were able to eat a large portion with a spoon, keeping the whole process a bit neater. After reaching the cone, it was pure heaven, with the cone plus the ice cream to enjoy. Seriously good ice cream, very friendly and attentive staff, and a delight to eat. Only problem? It's 2000 miles from our home!"}
