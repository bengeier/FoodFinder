{"text":"Pita Heaven is literally my heaven. I have only ever eaten the chicago gyros, but they are d.i.v.i.ne. The perfect mix of grease + quality lamb. I have been to other places where the gyros seem to be a little too roasted, or seasoned, or \"quality,\" but the lamb here did not taste like anything out of the ordinary.   I often call in my order, and they have it ready within 5 minutes. THeir fountain drinks are also MASSIVE and STYROFOAM.    The only reason I didn't give Pita Heaven 5 stars is because I am stingy with my 5's and have a hard time giving one to a \"not-so-fast fast food\" place. But between you and me, it is a 4.75."}
{"text":"Food here is great I'm from Chicago and there beef is better than Al's Beef"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mediterranean chicken salad. It was fast..it was fresh..it was scrumptious. What I love more than great food is genuinely friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love this place, good food, decent prices and a good ambiance. Have been to Pita Heaven quite many times and I recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"First time here and ordered chicken schwarma wrap and falafel. It wasn't the worst I've ever had, but didn't feel like there was enough flavor in the chicken to get me hooked. I'm not a falafel expert but this one had a lot of parsley so there was a strong bitter and grassy flavor."}
{"text":"This is a tasty choice for a pita wrap. The chicken pita is awesome and I can't wait to get back for some lamb swarma. Give this place a shot, it's well done."}
{"text":"Steak plate was VERY fatty, hard to find a piece of steak without hard fat in it.  They would not substitute rice for extra salad?? I would not come back."}
{"text":"Pita bread is nice. The rest, bad to worse. Even the salad tasted bad. NOT fresh."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I ordered the Chicago gyro and salad combo for about $8.20. It comes with a drink. The gyro meat was flavorful and the pita bread was delicious. The gyro was huge! My Greek salad was good. I also ordered a side of spicy tazitki and it was delicious with gyro. This restaurant makes My Big Fat Greek restaurant looks bad!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious...it is the only thing that keeps me coming back. The owners and staff however stink. They are not friendly & seem to hate being there. Today I placed a to-go order...I am the only one in the restaurant mind you, and the old guy behind the counter rings the bell so I can come grab  my order from the counter because god forbid he walk up to me and hand me a bag...just rude."}
{"text":"Their gyros and fries are so beyond incredible. Their service however, leaves much to be desired. The girl that is there often is rude and obviously hates her job. She talks down to the customers. The fries though."}
{"text":"I've been to Pita Heaven several times & have had good experiences, but my most recent visit will be my last. The cashier Andrina had an attitude with me when I tried asking a few questions about the menu & was anything but helpful. In my opinion, their  menu is over priced for the amount of food you receive. There are plenty of other Greek restaurants in the Chandler area & I'll be happy to spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Solid Greek food offering of pita sandwiches, dips and full meals... with Chicago style hot dogs, Italian beef sandwiches and burgers. The real focus here is on the Mediterranean food, and it's a good variety of options."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a yummy steak gyro lunch.  It was loaded with meat and the tzatziki was fresh and tasty.  The fries were pretty good, too.  I will be coming back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Pita Heaven is your average  Pita joint.  Gyros are good, not as meaty as other places but for the pice they are good.  Not aure what the chicago gyro really is vs a gyro, but its all good.  Recommend it for a quick lunch,."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Greek restaurant. I just started working in Chandler and stumbled upon this place and it is perfection. The Mediterranean salad is my favorite thing. The dressing has sumac in it which adds the extra acidity that brightens the salad up tremendously. By far the best salad I've ever had. Their gyro meat is perfect. The service is sweet and it feels like part of the family."}
{"text":"They close at 8 pm on Saturday . Call prior to going there these times are not correct. Food is good and fresh the French fries are almost as good as in n out."}
{"text":"I won't be returning to pita heaven. Pita purgatory would be a more suiting name; the food is edible, but you will not enjoy it. In the middle of the meal I looked around the restaurant and thought to myself, \"Everyone here must only be here because they don't know any better\". The staff was friendly, establishment was clean and well dressed, and the kitchen was quick, but the food was utterly disappointing, mediocre at best. I had the gyro with a side salad, and my friends had the chicken which they described as abominably bland. They did not finish their meals which was unusual for a group of 20 year old men. The pita bread was OK, the salad was OK, IMO they lack quality ingredients. You could quickly gather ingredients at a basic grocery store that would trump their pita and greens. The worst offender of the meal was their gyro meat which lacked rich herbs and spices, and had a rubbery, plastic, texture. I felt like it was diluted, not sure with what, but it did not have the dark brown coloring, consistent with all the wonderful, mouth watering, gyro meat I've had in my life. I'd be happy with this meal if I got it for half the price from a kiosk that sells pre-packaged, processed food. Go to Zorba's Greek cafe if you're looking for good Greek in this area."}
{"text":"Every time I've been to Pita Heaven I have thoroughly enjoyed my chicken pita. Presentation is great and ready within minutes. The staff is friendly and the decor looks better and better every time I go in. Having a small non chain business is hard and I recognize the enhancements. Great work! I will be returning often :)"}
{"text":"My favorite place for lunch. Warm pita bread and hummus are good. Chicken Gyros is tasty. I like it here. I want to try there other dish."}
{"text":"Nice crisp salad with my Gyro. Loved the dressing!! Pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food and the great staff."}
{"text":"I love Greek food and was so excited to find something close to home, however, this was such a disappointment. My food wasnt the greatest and the dalmas tasted like they had started to firment. The food was overpriced and not a very good value."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here.  I had the largest gyro I've ever had, and not because it was stuffed with lettuce.  It was entirely meat, tomatoes and onions, which I was told is what makes it \"Chicago style.\"  The pitas were very light and fluffy.  The meat was also very tasty, genuine gyro sausage, not the Steakums everyone tries to pass off nowadays in their gyro simulations.   The baklava was very good, well spiced and not cloyingly sweet.  The decor was also nice, well decorated with original art on the walls, ad the prices were reasonable.  But my wife's chicken pita was just OK, and the hummus was pretty sad, it tasted store-bought and we did not even finish it.  Overall a good choice, but I think you have to pick and choose around the menu."}
{"text":"Just discovered this restaurant and love it!! Friendly staff and delicious, authentic food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to Pita Heaven for lunch on a quiet Sunday afternoon. I'm not very familiar with Greek food, but  we were looking for a quick lunch and at least the opportunity to make a healthy choice for lunch, and Pita Heaven seemed to fit the bill.  I ordered a chicken pita, added feta, and a side salad instead of fries. The pita was HUGE, the chicken well seasoned, and the feta added just the right kick. My friend had the pork loin souvlaki pita and it was very tasty as well. The tzatziki sauce was mild and creamy, though i would probably ask for it (and the salad dressing) on the side next time so i could control the amount that i use.  My meal was $10.00, more than what you would spend at In and Out across the parking lot, but I'm more than willing to spend the couple extra bucks at a local restaurant  that offers me a healthier alternative to typical fast food."}
{"text":"We have bee here 3 times the past few months and every time are satisfied. Definitely worth the visit if you miss middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Food was really good. I had the gyro lunch special. Really delicious. We will be back."}
{"text":"This was my family's first time in. We spent 55 for a family of four. Showed up at 8:15..closes at 9. AFTER we paid and sat down we were told they only had rice for one plate.  Disappointment at that moment.  Food was okay..chicken somewhat bland. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Good food but, the staff seem unorganized. Poor young girl got yelled at by the older \"what looked to be owner\".The place wasn't that busy and she was trying to help me with to-go boxes when he yelled at her. I walked out with to-go items after waiting five minutes for them and no bag thanks to that man."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Salad. Thought it was amazing, chicken was very good and everything was fresh and dressing was delicious. Would definitely come back and try the gyro, was trying to eat somewhat healthy so I got just the salad this time."}
{"text":"Only gets a 3 star cause my fiancé liked it and I thought it was terrible . She got the gyro with lamb and a Caesar salad . She loved it . I on the other hand ordered the Philly cheesesteak gyro and got nothing but burnt meat and veggies. The staff wasn't really friendly the place was dead . The cashier was on her cellphone as we walked in and didn't notice us . The place was clean."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Pita Heaven!  It is a family run restaurant and the atmosphere is very friendly and warm.  Also the dining room is pleasant and clean as a pin.    They make their own dolmas in house and my wife, who loves Greek food, thought they were fantastic.  She also enjoyed the hummus and pitas.  I loved, loved my gyro w/ fries!  Great flavor!  Try this place...if you like Greek food, you will like it!"}
{"text":"Pita Heaven is down the street from my office and I eat here once or twice a month. The place is clean, busy and the people who work here are pleasant, friendly and fast. Ordered to go, my standard is the gyro salad, vinaigrette and a pita on the side. There's a ton of tender gyro meat on top of fresh greens, feta, cucumbers, tomato and greek olives. Not much more I could ask for in meaty Greek ruffage!   Today, there was a mix up with my order. I paid for a gyro pita. Not only did the staff kindly correct my order with the salad without problem, or accept my offer to pay the $2 difference, (it's worth it), they packed the mistaken gyro pita up with me to take. Who does that nowawdays? My co-worker was thrilled to have the gifted pita and my salad was fantastic!"}
{"text":"The meat was excellent.  The pitas were soft and warm.  Only complaint was the hummus.  WAY to garlicky.  I love garlic but this was a bit too much for me.  Would still highly recommend..."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time and ordered the gyro platter and Greek salad side. I didn't realize that the salad was extra until after I finished paying. Oh well. First off, the service is extremely quick and friendly. At peak lunch hours, there were 3 cooks, 2 servers, 2 cash register ringers, which shows how much the restaurant emphasizes their customer's quick service. The food was plentiful for the price! Good meat portions and salad toppings. The thing that sealed the deal for me was the pita bread. It was so deliciously soft that it almost melts in your mouth. It complemented well with the rest of the platter. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"At most places I order the same thing each time I go. Here I order something different each time. It never disappoints! The service is great and they don't seem to be bothered that sometimes it takes me literally 5-10 minutes to decide what I want. Next on my list to try will be the dolmada. That will be the true test!"}
{"text":"Great Greek place! The gyros and chicken shawarma are delicious as well as their tzatziki sauce!!"}
{"text":"Very fresh, made to order food. No leftovers served here! How many times have you ordered a salad and been served old, brown, yucky lettuce? Too many times for this gal to count and thankfully, you won't find that wilty stuff here. And I did notice two A ratings from the food health board, so people, go eat there and support a local business in Chandler. My family will definitely be back! Yum! If that's not enough for you, my 19 yr old son ordered a pita sandiwch type thing. He scarfed it down in no time and was up at the counter ordering another one. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Amazing gyros! Will def be back! Love the legit Chicago vibe! I scarfed down my gyro and loved every bite!"}
{"text":"Friendly, quick service.  Family owned & operated. Gyros & salad have have great flavor, fries are excellent, Best baklava I've ever had!  Great value - a lot of meat on the Gyros. Clean. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Chicago!   Drove past the place one weekend with my mom (Chicago born and raised & Greek!) and we had to stop.  Really made us feel like we were home in Chicago when we were asked if we wanted to add fries and 'pop'! Love the old school gyro meat roasting on the spit too!   My mom ordered the classic gyro and I had the chicken salad. As soon as the food was brought to the table, I knew I should've ordered a gyro. It looked so damn good!  The marinated chicken was to die for - just needed a little more seasoning in the salad dressing. But who am I to complain, I ate the whole plate!   We were skeptical of the tzatziki sauce was made with dill. We're not fans of tzatziki with dill. To my surprise, it was very light on the dill and could barely taste it.  It was actually very tasty!  Need to let all my Chicagoland friends know to visit this place - it's a slice of home in the Valley of the Sun! So good, we're going back tonight for dinner!"}
{"text":"Their food is good but customer service is terrible... I walked into the empty restaurant this evening and the girl behind the counter was looking down at her phone. I've gone here several times before so I knew what I wanted... I proceeded to watch her scroll through her Instagram feed (phone on counter) without saying a word to me for about 3 mins. She finally started to take my order and while I'm speaking, looks down and continues to look at her phone. Horribly rude! Needless to say, I left without ordering and I will not return again during the night shift."}
{"text":"NO BRAINER...YOU REALLY SHOULD EAT HERE:  still Still STILL the best! Best food, best service, always fresh, never disappoints.  The people here are always friendly, never indifferent, with attention to the details of their service and quality food.    With everyone from the cooks to the counter people, It's obvious why everyone loves the place!  If you do eat here, drop me a note let me know what you think... And don't forget to review them!   Keith"}
{"text":"It was my fiancé and my 1st time here. We went on Yelp to find another place however, in our attempt to locate the other place we saw this and had to check it out. Super packed and fairly loud inside but we were served within 10mins! Crazy!!! I was surprised and thankful because we were hungry. I got the chicken shawarma on pita w/fries and he got the beef dip sandwhich w/fries. My chicken had a curry taste to it which I like but was a tiny (very tiny) bit dry. Large portion of meet. $10 for each meal and it comes with fries and a pop. Not bad for the portions at all. Fries were fresh and crispy. We sat outside to enjoy the weather and it wasn't as hectic. I would go here again! Staff was friendly too"}
{"text":"Food here is above average and the menu pictures are excellent. As the food arrives, it looks very much like the menu board. Drinks are Coke products, so no Pepsi/tea without lemon. Everything is visible with the glass window overlooking the kitchen area. Friendly staff and nice location! Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome place! I had heard such good reviews and it totally lived up to them! Definitely recommend! And the staff was sooooo awesome! Such great customer service for sure!"}
{"text":"All orders are placed at the counter whether you eat at Pita Heaven or want take-out.  Thankfully I arrived with my girlfriend who raved about the food, had been many times before, and knew the ropes.  I felt so off balanced and don't usually choose places that require \"self-help\" (ordering at the counter, getting your own drink, utensils, napkins, condiments, and taking a stick with a number to place on the table).  The food is good, but not fast.  It's cooked to order so it comes out fresh.  We waited about 15 minutes from order to service of our weekday lunch (Mediterranean salad & Spanakopita.)  The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean, comfortable, and has lots of tables to \"hang\" for a while after eating."}
{"text":"This place is great and very authentic. Food is delicious and they have high chairs and a small kids menu. Adequate amount of tables and chairs and you can see them make everything near the counter. A little on the pricier side for combos, but decent portions."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! In fact, I crave the gyro salad at least once a week.   While it is a $10 salad, which is a lot to some, it's totally worth it! As you can see in the pics, the salad is loaded with gyro meat. There is a plethora of veggies and the dressing is ever so yummy. They also give you a side of taziki sauce, and who doesn't love that with gyro meat!?! Due to the amount of meat and veggies, I should eat this salad in two sittings, but I always devour it in one.   Friends of mine also have great things to say about this place. Please check it out. Also, right now they are offering 10% off with a Yelp check in."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Greek food place. Just wish they were open later! Other than that, I love their food and staff"}
{"text":"Frank and the rest of Pita Heaven are a great bunch of gentlemen and ladies. The food is amazing, the service is great and my wife and I will be customers for life! I recommend the Chicken Shawarma as well as the pita chips and hummus!"}
{"text":"A few day's ago, I  stopped into Pita Heaven for some lunch with a couple of friends. This little spot gets packed really quickly during the lunch hour so I suggest coming in a little early.  We decided to try the vine leaves first and they did not disappoint.  I choose to have the the gyro pita and salad. The gyro meat was simply the most flavorful I have had! A fresh made pita (they make their own in a very cool looking machine) enclosed a generous portion of meat that spilled out from the bread. The bread was soft, warm and spongy, the meat was absolutely delicious.My salad on the other hand was very bland and not very greek. There wasn't enough feta cheese, the dressing was not lemony enough and the tomatoes were unripe and unflavorful, and one olive does not do it in a greek salad! Jose tried the kebaab. It is cooked fresh and they warn you that it does take about 15 minutes to prepare. Well worth the wait! I couldn't resist sampling a few morsels and it was very flavorful. The were beautifully grilled on the outside and still moist on the inside. The presentation was beautiful and they were served with a side of yellow rice. Phil decided to try one of the Chicago offerings, Phil doesn't like trying new foods and was quite apprehensive, finally deciding on the Italian beef sandwich. To our relief he loved it!  He was so pleased he even expressed his pleasure to the staff preparing it.  Our only complaint would be one of the staff members who seemed rather unfriendly, but overall Pita Heaven was a great experience."}
{"text":"We had two gyro's and a chicken hummus. The gyros were great - both in taste and value priced. Their tzatziki had great favor but was a little on the thin side, I prefer a thicker sauce. The chicken was well cooked but the hummus was bland. Overall, I'll go back to try more items and have another gyro."}
{"text":"I recently went vegetarian and Pita Heaven is now one of my favorite places to stop for lunch. I like the #7(grilled veggie wrap) and the #8(Falafel wrap), and Dolmas have always been one of my favorite snacks, so I was very happy to find out that they were available here.  I have had the chance to speak with the manager, and he is a very cool guy. He is also a vegetarian, and said that he is looking to expand the Vegetarian menu soon. There are nice paintings on the walls, and the is a TV in case you plan on eating in. You can call ahead an take you food to go, and everyone I made eye contact with smiled back at me. Things still seem a little new, which makes sense since they just opened; the lady at the register seemed flustered when I asked her about the falafel, but I'm sure that once they all get settled in, this place will be 5 star worthy:-)"}
{"text":"I just finished stuffing my face with leftovers from this joint and was inspired to write a review.  Man, oh man do I ever love the gyro plate.  It's so simple yet so good.  For $9.95 I can get 2 meals out of the mound of thinly-sliced, perfectly-seasoned gyro meat, the light, fluffy rice, warm soft pita, and the perfect, PERFECT fresh tzatziki sauce.  My husband and I have tried a few other things on the menu, all good, but that gyro plate talks to me in my sleep and then I must get it.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! We live about 15 minutes from Pita Heaven but it is worth the drive! The employees are always so friendly the food is delicious! Everything is so good but we love the Chicken Gyro plate with yummy yellow rice and the Mediterranean chicken. Their hummus and Tzatziki is delicious too. Can't go wrong here! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and happened to stop in for lunch. We had gotten there right at about opening time so there was only one other person in there eating. They have a variety of lunch specials that were pretty well priced. We ordered the Gyro Pitas which came with french fries or a salad. We also ordered their Cilantro Hummus. As for the Gyros they were pretty good had a very generous portion of meat which was nice to see and they pita itself was very fresh. As for the hummus not the best we've had but mediocre. We'll be coming back though as it is pretty good and close to the house."}
{"text":"The food is good and the restaurant is clean. I usually call my order in to pick up, and it has always been ready on time. I love their tzatziki sauce and Pita bread. My husband usually has the Philly cheesesteak Pita and fries, both are delicious. The chicken plate is also tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 meals of Chicago Gyro with Geek salad on the side. The meals came out hot and decent. There was plenty of veggies and the staff is friendly. However, I really don't like the way they honor Grubhub deals. Once you pass out coupon deals to customers, then you have to be the one that honor it and not take it for granted.  I received $5 off deal when order on Grubhub with the minimum of $10, so I asked my friend if she wanted to try new food and we were pretty happy about the deal.  When I got there to pick up the food, the manager lied to me about $5 already got deducted from the total. I looked at the bill, and I looked at him saying \"I don't think I got any discount here.\" He replied to me, \"The food you're paying is cheap enough already.\"  Okay now, I have no problem paying for the original prices. But in my mind, please don't deceive customers by the coupons and then charge them full prices \"because it's cheap enough.\"   Overall, I paid my part, and sitting here typing a tip for y'all: please don't believe in anykind of deals this restaurant gave out."}
{"text":"I would not give this restaurant 1 star if it didn't force me to in order to write this review. My friend and I were there  this past Thursday and both became violently ill after eating there. We ordered the hummus and cucumbers to share and two separate entries both served with cucumber sauce.  I called and alerted management and all the asked for was a receipt from the doctors or hospital."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch the other day and got the Pork Souvlaki Pita. It was pretty darn good. Everything was very fresh and flavorful. I was glad I didn't get the fries too because the sandwich was pretty big and filling. I was checking out what other people were getting and the salads looked really good. I will be coming back again. It got pretty packed by the time I left so before 12:00 for lunch is recommended."}
{"text":"I love trying new local businesses and had seen this place driving by them so many times decided it was time to try it out.  We ordered a gyro with hummus (jalepeno cilantro hummus).  We even got an extra pita.  I was very quite impressed.  I love hummus but had not tried this kind before.  I could just eat their hummus as it was so good.  I am so glad they recommended it for us.  That was the perfect size for two people.   I will be back for more hummus and gyros and who knows I may try something new next time!!!"}
{"text":"I may have to try this place again another time. I usually don't write review this bad, but every now and then a place comes across that makes it happen. I came based on reviews and was excited. I got Kebob and \"grilled\" veggies. I paid $10. I got a tiny plate of food, for me quality over quantity, but this was a joke. Now it wasn't very good either. The chicken wasn't Kebob at all, they were two thin cutlets of breast meat. The seasoning was ok at best. The veggies were terrible, they included grilled baby carrots (lazy and nasty), the bell peppers tasted off (is that possible) and the broccoli and cauliflower tasted like they were frozen veggies. Def not a place I'd go outta my way for,  maybe I'd try something small if a friend really wanted to go there."}
{"text":"Ran by here after shopping nearby and was looking for something other than fast food drive thru. Glad we stopped. Was debating between the hummus pita and the Chicago Gyro (thanks to other Yelpers photos and reviews). Went with the Chicago. Ordered to go, waited about 4 minutes, and the friendly cashier brought it over to me. It was loaded full of beef and lamb. I had requested they add hummus spread, which was divine. Overall, I prefer more veggies than meat, but the meat was tender and delish so I overlooked it. The tzatziki sauce was pretty good too.  Wish it would've come with lettuce or something else, but the onions and peppers were tasty.  Will be here again to try the hummus wrap next time. Prices were decent too for the amount of food you receive."}
{"text":"The food here is generally quite good; however, we just had the Chicken Schwarma, and it was terribly dried out, and the Tzatziki sauce was so watered down with no cucumber in it.  We have had the Gyro, and it is very good; however, the Tzatziki, is weak.  The lady at the counter, Whitney, was fantastic! Very positive and sharp.  She greeted everyone who came in and exited the restaurant.  We sure wish that the restaurant would provide Sriracha hot sauce for a condiment!  Pita Jungle, provides this for their food, and it's become quite popular."}
{"text":"Fresh made falafel, warm soft pitas, leafy green lettuce, classy interior...I will becoming back! And these Chicago guys call their soft drinks \"pop\", the way it should be :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Between the chicken and the steak plate, the generous serving of expertly grilled marinated beef wins hands down!"}
{"text":"We have dined here a couple of times and the food has been always good.  We normally get the chicken Shwarma gyro.  I really do love their pita bread and hummus as it taste fresh and homemade and their double fried French fries are always delicious!! They have redone their menu and it looks so much better then the previous moving menus that most people seem to complain about! The only complain I have about the place is the customer service, they are always in a hurry to get you to order quickly while you are deciding what to get and if they can, they could start greeting customers every now and then instead of have a blank stare in their faces, especially the cook who doesn't look like he wants to be there. But if you can handle that, this is a really great affordable place to eat gyros! The restaurant is always clean and comfortable to dine in."}
{"text":"My sister and I have been here a number of times and the food has always been fabulous and the staff very nice and engaging. I have also been here with my coworkers for our lunch hour and have never been disappointed. They must dip their fries in liquid awesome because they are freakin sweet!"}
{"text":"we have been going here a lot lately since it's convenient. I am from Chicago and we have tried the grilled chicken pita, the gyro pita, the greek salad and the fries...haven't actually tried the 'chicago' stuff yet. a great little lunch place"}
{"text":"First things first, they are not Greek. Ok I too have given this place more than one chance. First visit was ok. Met the owner and was excited they were there. I work in the area.   Second visit I encouraged other employees to try the food. I called and asked if we could give them our order the day before so it would be ready before lunch crowd. No?. One of the rude girls there said no you have to call the day of the pick up? So we called in our orders all nine of them as soon as they opened. When we got there we had to stand in line with people who were placing orders-12 of them. Ok our food sat there for over 30 minutes that we knew of.  Friday evening at 7:55 I called and asked what time they closed and one of those girls told me 9:00pm.  I drove 12 miles back to the area. When I arrived at 8:45 pm, I assume the same girl I had spoken with earlier said we decided to close early tonight. Thats enough for me.  The owner needs to send his girls to charm school and they need to know customers aren't coming in because of them."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here yesterday, and it was fantastic. I don't know what all is in their meat marinades, but they have a little extra something that I haven't tasted at any other Greek restaurant. Their meats are SO flavorful and delicious. I got the Mediterranean chicken salad, my mom had a beef gyro sandwich, and we got an order of dolmas. It was a little bit pricey, but the food was really good. I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Very clean environment and speedy. Very pleased with the quality and flavor!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall, ambiance is nothing special ie. brick wallpaper?? But they know how to cook chicken!!! I have switched from Pita Jungle to here simply because Pita Jungle's chicken is starting to suck and this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Gyro fully stuffed and sauce were GREAT! Couldn't even finish it."}
{"text":"Good lunch deal. I got the Italian beef, and it was delicious. We didn't get a pita with our hummus combo, but one of the workers gave us one for free when I asked to pay for one! Thanks whoever you are!  Atmosphere is nice, and the restaurant itself is clean. There's also an outdoor area--no misters though.  Edit: Wait. I think I see misters."}
{"text":"Very yummy lunch place... Every thing is good here.. The mediterranean salad is the absolute best I have ever had..."}
{"text":"Is this heaven?... no, it's Chandler.  This small counter-style restaurant in a strip mall is a solid choice for lunch.  I've had the gyro and the Greek salad here before, but today I stepped it up for the gyro platter.  It was outstanding.  For $9, I got food served to me on 3 different plates.  There was a generous portion of gyro meat, and french fries served with sliced tomatoes & onions and tzatziki.  Then, there was separate side greek salad and a pita.  That's a lot to review.  The gyro meat was about what you'd expect.  At least it looks legit because they cut it from one of those giant meat cylinders.  The french fries were fantastic, thick cut but crispy with a seasoning salt on them.  The tzatziki was thicky and lumpy, with a strong dill flavor (and I mean all of that as a compliment.  It was good stuff.)  The salad was crisp and fresh with an acidic Greek dressing and some feta cheese.  It was mostly lettuce, but there was tomato, onion, and a single olive & pepperoccini to make it a nice presentation.  And finally, the pita was grilled warm and toasty, as it should be at a place named Pita Heaven.  I ate my entire salad, and about half of the rest.  $9 is a little pricey for lunch, but not when you make two meals out of it.  There is a large menu, but I've never strayed from the Mediterranean choices.  If you like Chicago hot dogs or beef sandwiches, they've got you covered.  If you're on a health kick, the Greek salad with chicken is a healthy, but satisfying option."}
{"text":"I love Pita Heaven!!! When I moved to Chandler this became my go to place. I even tried having them cater my wedding. I live in Scottsdale now but still make the trek to Chandler just for this place!"}
{"text":"Close to my work. I visit this place once or twice a month. Clean, fast service and great food. Easy on the wallet too."}
{"text":"I don't really come here very often.  Usually when I'm in the area I'm going somewhere else.  But came again today, and it was still good.    I kept it simple and went for the Chicago gyro.  It was hot, tasted fresh, and while at first glance you may think there isn't a lot of meat you will see once you fold it to take a bite that there is plenty of meat.  I was quite happy with my portion.  My wife said her Mediterranean salad was \"refreshing\".  Nothing fancy here.  Gyros shwarma, some salads, hummus...but they seem to do it well, and the portions are reasonable for the price paid.  The people behind the counter seemed nice too.  I should probably come here more."}
{"text":"I've only had the Gyro and salad here but it is done so well that I cannot think of anything else to get, I stand at the line and look at other options knowing I should make that attempt to go outside my norm but the pita always wins. Great Gyro, large portions of lamb, a must stop when you are in the area. So this ratings is for the Gyro and Sald only."}
{"text":"Disappointed in my meal today or any time older guy,who I think is the owner, is in the kitchen. I come in almost every Sunday after Church like click work and order the same food the same way. Even if I call they know my order. For some reason the guy who made my food though it was ok to put the sauce I asked on my food instead of in the side which is how it always comes when I order it to go. The look that he gets on his face anytime he messes up an order is as if it is an inconvenience to him to make it right.  Smh. The little things like this keep me doing business again. Especially since it's happened more than three times."}
{"text":"I honestly have not had many Gyros in my life, so I really had nothing to compare this place with.  But everytime I have come I thoroughly enjoyed my Gyro.  Service is friendly and quick, but I do think the price a little more than what I see on average in other places similar.  Since this place is a walking distance from my new house, I will be comming back!"}
{"text":"It's very challenging to find a place that fixes shawarma that is actually carved off of the spicket. I have finally found one that truly roasts and marinates both the steak and chicken. Now if they'd only do lamb on the spicket that would be the ultimate heaven experience. They do have lamb, I just didn't see any on the spicket. Needless to say, this is the best place that I've ever been to outside of Europe. I travel quite a bit and Pita Heaven you truly know how to make me homesick for Europe. Well done! Also you can't beat these prices for the amount of food you get it's amazing! If you're in the area definitely stop by for an amazing food experience!"}
{"text":"Being out of the country for a while it's nice to have the option to go to different restaurants.   I ordered a combo with a salad. I really wanted lemonade but all they had was that nasty light lemonade with that awful aspartame taste. Anyway I made a different selection and I survived.  The pita was really good. The salad had potential but I was not a fan of the salad dressing that it was drenched in. Next time I will order the French fries. Overall it was good and I will be back."}
{"text":"I like the food, especially the Gyro meat with tzaziki sauce This place is really good. I'm not a fan of their fries though."}
{"text":"I am in heaven! The gryo meat is seasoned and cooked beautifully and the cucumber sauce is refreshing but not too strong, perfect for my taste buds! The cucumber salad is dressed well with ample feta and tomatoes and these juicy pepperoncinis. Thank you Frank for making this delicious food. Also the dolma was the BEST I've ever had and the baklava is superp! I could eat this food everyday and for happy :)"}
{"text":"Had a chicken shwarma today and I have to say I don't get what all the hype is about. I bit into and spit out multiple pieces of fatty chicken. Not gunna lie that is such a meal killer. The flavor of the chicken was good but not amazing. The tzatziki sauce was very good and flavorful however. I thought the prices were a bit high for a fast food type restaurant."}
{"text":"cost $10 gyro, fries and coke.  Quick pleasant service, delicious food.  Great place."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!! I placed an order from Grubhub and 2 hours later received our food and it was stale and disgusting. This was both the restaurants fault for not RE-making the food when the grub hub delivery driver left before the food was ready but also grub hubs fault because I sat on the phone for 15 minutes mostly on hold wth grub hub!!!!! I used to use them often but never ever again. This is the 2nd time they have messed up. I'm done and I wouldn't recommend the restaurant because they allowed the driver to come back and take food to deliver that had been sitting there over an hour."}
{"text":"They have since done away with cheese fries and hot dogs... Can you really claim to be from Chicago and get rid of the hot dog? disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is tasty.  They do have a sign that each dish is cooked to order, so that takes some extra time.  I like to go off peak times, so I don't have to worry about time.   I like the outdoor seating al fresco during cooler months.  I've liked every dish as have my guests."}
{"text":"They close at 8!!!! So mad. Food is good though so ill still rate high based On that."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch and this place rocks. the meat was soooo GOOD and they had some of the softest & freash Fata cheese i have ever had!"}
{"text":"Delish!!! Tried this place after doing some afternoon shopping and so glad I did! The Gyros salad is so yummy. Love the gyro meat and the tizzikki sauce is awesome!"}
{"text":"Worst $11 Italian beef I've ever had.i love Greek/Mediterranean food. I'm from Chicago so my expectations are high. The bun was reminiscent of a grocery store yeast roll. Italian beef must have a roll that will hold up to the wet meat and juices. The meat was nothing like any a good Italian beef. More like a Steakumm. And to really seal the deal, the fries were battered. Such a waste as fries are great on their own. Unfortunately this was my first and last trip to Pita Heaven."}
{"text":"Very good food, anytime I'm craving Greek I come here. Service is always efficient and fast, only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because it can be a little pricey, but not terrible overall. Parking also isn't the best situation, but it is a strip mall so what do you expect. Pita bread is always nice and warm and soft, I love that they don't drench their hummus in olive oil and that everything is always piping hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everytime I am in the area, I make it a habit to come over here! They have best falafel and homemade hummus I have eaten.  Coming from Chicago, it's hard to find a really good pita place to eat at living in Chandler, and this place really hits the spot! Pita Jungle, look out!"}
{"text":"This very well could be Pita Heaven but instead it was Dolma Hell! They were canned and dreadful. That is all.  1 star based solely on the Dolma."}
{"text":"I'm here at least twice a week, I work across the street I had the worse customer service experience today from Rene. I called to place an order, after I said I wanted to chicken pita meal she asked for my number and read it back to me and I explained there wasn't a 2. So she hung up on me. I go in just to order in person and it is 10:50am and she tells me she can't take my order since they are not open and tells me no one else is in but I clearly see people in the back. Their hours of operation are 10:30am - 8:00pm. I've never had an issue here, I always tip and always leave happy. The girl who normally is at the register & takes orders on the phone is always smiling and welcoming."}
{"text":"Due to there being no option for zero stars I suppose 1 will have to do.  Don't waste your time or money on these scam artists.  The food is in no way close to heavenly and the staff there is rude and un-apologetic when you point out they screwed up your order.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is horrible I had my oder messed up so many times that I stopped going. The owner needs to teach his girls  some people skills as they need to know customers aren't coming in because of them."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The Pitas are very good. Fresh shaved gyro meat and fresh warm Pitas . Always great customer service as well. Only complaint is I order a Greek side salad and the olives are traditional with the rock hard Pitts so be careful I almost chipped a tooth biting into it!"}
{"text":"They charge extra  for hot sauce without informing. There is Pork Souvlaki menu on the window but not available inside. They should have taken down the old menu on the window. Too greedy. Not recommended."}
{"text":"It's always nice to see actual Greek workers who know their shit.  Bravo.  Shawarma and med chk salad was perfect"}
{"text":"Being a Chicago native, I have high expectations for anything that has Chicago written on it(ask Rosatti's)  Of course, I ordered the Chicago style dog.  Not bad!  Not 'slap yo' momma' good, but  until I find something better, which I will keep searching, this is a good start."}
{"text":"I had this my first day in Chandler. It was astonishingly good. I had to sit outside in 115 degree weather, but I will do it again for this place. Their food is marvelous. My four-year-old even ate her food. =O"}
{"text":"I got two steak salads and they were delicious.  I was told by a few people to try their house dressing it was a vingarette and normally I think are oily and the salad had big chunks of feta instead of crumbles.   This one wasn't and it was lemony. My friend got the cilantro ranch but he said it wasn't ranch like but more creamy and very flavorful ."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years but the service has gotten very bad. Now they are turning people away before closing"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! I get the Greek chicken salad and I love it. I grabbed a few tasters for my coworkers to try and they were nice enough to make me a sampler for them. Everyone loved it. This is a definite keeper. I highly recommend it. GREAT FOR LOW CARB DIETS!"}
{"text":"I was not that impressed, I had a Gyro , Fries and jalapeno poppers.   The Gyro meat was a lilttle on the drie side , needed more Tzatziki sause aswell.  The Fries were GREAT nice and crispy . The Poppers were over cooked . Very Polite staff .  Im from Chicago , If you say Chicago Style . MAKE IT CHICAGO STYLE !"}
{"text":"The resturant is very hot, and the staff was not terribly friendly (no welcome, no smiles). The constant menu rotaions on the monitors is annoying. I just got a hummus pita, not bad. My wife did not even dent her \"premium\" salad. Not worth the $$ IMHO"}
{"text":"This is my go to for the standard American-Greek food or a pita. Friendly and quick service. Average price."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, service is fast and the staff is always friendly. Pita Heaven instantly became our go-to place for lunch with coworkers. Gyro Salad Pop is what I usually go for and unlike many places, you'll actually find the pita filled with meat. That much food for the price is a no brainer."}
{"text":"This place use to be good. The service was fine, very nice young lady took my order. This review is purely about my meal. We came here awhile back and it use to be tasty 6-12 months ago.. Well, I ordered the Chicken Schwarma Pita Combo w/ Fries. The Chicken was really dry and kind of greyish brown, just looked really over cooked and was dripping w/ oil yet so so dry. Tzatziki sauce had absolutely no flavor. The pita was soft, thats about it.  Oh, and the fries.. ugh, have you ever had a fry where they haven't replaced the oil ( come on you can tell) in who knows how long? Yeah, tasted like everything on the menu, no thank you.  We will probably not be going back. :("}
{"text":"Standard Gyros joint, clean and with a friendly staff.  Middle of the road flavors with nothing that really stands out.  For the value prop ... I'd probably just stick with the pita rather than the plates."}
{"text":"The food here is good, they have your traditional Mediterranean food, gyros, shwarma and falafel all with a Chicago twist which is kinda cool. I've tried everything here in the last year and here's my report.  The beef is dry not juicy at all, I think it's a little overcooked.  The chicken is delicious.  The falafel is over breaded and over fried, still decent.  The humous is average at best. They have an Italian beef sandwich, it's probably the best thing they have, order it with extra au jus and extra peppers you'll love it. They would have gotten a 3 star rating but they have a major flaw, phone orders are never ready.  I've given them 5 opportunities to have my phone order ready, I show up, 5 minutes, or 10 minutes, or 15 minutes after I order and I show up and they start making it.  I order by phone because I'm in a rush, they make the excuse that they want me to have fresh food...well then why even take the order? Their take out style is terrible, eat out there, you won't enjoy take out."}
{"text":"The food was very tasty. We tried the chicken shawarma, and gyro plate with a side of hummus and baba ghanoush. The service was excellent. They were extremely nice and welcoming especially the gentleman. We will definitely come here again. Thank you"}
{"text":"Service was fast since the place wasn't busy.  The gyros was amazing (probably the best in the valley). I also had the hummus and pita bread as an appetizer and it was traditional Middle Eastern food...again delicious."}
{"text":"The food is great, we take out at least once a week. The cashier girl gave me attitude when I told her the food took longer than the 10 min, in fact it took double the time. Heck, she couldn't even offer an apology all she could say is \"yeah\". I won't be getting take out as much since I'm not a valued customer."}
{"text":"Food was decent; flavorful. My son LOVED it here. Pricing is a little high however the \"plates\" are big! Will come back again"}
{"text":"The food was ok. I thought it was expensive for lunch $8. I'd rather drive mile down the road and pay $2-3 less and have the same quality."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for the very first time and the food was freakin' awesome! They also do catering which btw all 30 guests of ours absolutely loved it and kept saying and asking \"this is so good, where is this from?\""}
{"text":"Hidden little gem in Chandler! Pita Heaven is underrated and is SO much better than Pita Jungle. Authentic Greek + Chicago eatery. Have not tried an item on the menu that I didn't like. Best part is that it is locally owned. I love coming in for the gyro pita and the Mediterranean chicken salad. Also obsessed with their fries + tzatziki sauce, I could eat that for days."}
{"text":"Parking is a disaster.  Salad prices with meat are $9.50. :(  So many better and cheaper options close to there. Love the concept but hate the execution."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Friendly staff, heavenly good pitas, fresh ingredients, and fast service. What more can you look for? They have 10% cards for th new customers. I'm taking my lunch here few times a week."}
{"text":"Pita Heaven is one of my favorite places to visit for lunch. I've been coming here for a couple of years now and the food here is really good.  My usual go-to is the Chicago Gyro. Lot's of meat and tzatziki sauce to satisfy most critics. The Chicken Pita is something on my \"need to try list\", but every time I come back here, somehow I end up ordering the Chicago Gyro again. The greek salads and french fries here are also good.  I'm disappointed to tell you that their Chicago dog is no longer on the menu (please update the website, guys!). This was another one of my favorites, and since there are not too many Chi-town places around, it makes it a little more difficult to satisfy that craving for a Chicago tradition.  What surprised me was their Italian Beef sandwich. The meat was flavorful, moist, came with giardiniera and some au jus on the side for dipping. I'm picky when it comes to food from my hometown, and not too many places can crank out a good italian beef sandwich. I would probably rank this one second behind Portillo's.  Service here is good, the staff is friendly. This is a great place to grab a quick lunch and some great food. They get busy at times, and the background music sometimes makes me feel like I'm somewhere in a foreign land - a nice escape from work! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the 2 for $20 meals to go.  Chose the Gyro and Chicken Skewers.  You get a hummus, salad, entre and pita.  The food was hot and tasted good.  The restaurant is clean and the service friendly.  I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick bite to eat.  I wish they gave you more than 1 pita though, make sure you order an extra (if not 2).  Thank you Pita Heaven"}
{"text":"I ordered through Grubhub. My food was delicious. I ordered the Chicago gyro. The meat was so tender and flavorful. I ordered extra pita and was able to make two gyros with the amount of meat they gave me. I will definitely be back. The rice is also delicious!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  I've been here a few times. The gyros are good.  It's basically average quality and tastiness of food compared to other pita places around this area. Its very clean. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I believe I've tried something different each of the 4 times I've been  here and have enjoyed all. Today it was the Chicago gyro and it was huge.  The pit was soft and didn't crack down the middle spilling meat and sauce into your hand as will happen at some other places.  It reminded me of the first gyro I ever had in North Chicago almost 40 years ago.  The ambiance is comfortable and today the young lady behind the counter was very friendly and efficient.  The food came hot and quick and was all tasty.  Very extensive menu, a good choice for a lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the Gyro Plate! Delicious gyro meat, fresh vegetables always, and amazing rice."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced and great food.  Everything I've had here is good (Gyros, Salads and plates) and the people are nice.  I highly recommend the vegetarian platter but I sub out the baba ganoush for a second humus.  Dolomades are perfect."}
{"text":"My hubby and I decided to try something new, so he suggested this place. Said a bunch of his co-workers go there and he always wanted to try. He had the philly cheesesteak with fries ..... very tasty and the fries were very good just a tad cold... I had the chicago gyro with a side greek salad.... soooooooo yummy the meat was seasoned just right and soooo much of it ... i had to give some to my hubsters :)  very good and will be back .... extra plus is 2 miles from my house!!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!  We are here on business and Yelped this company!!  I could not believe the product they make!!  Every time we are in Phoenix we will come!!"}
{"text":"Best gyro and fries I've had in a long time! 5star quality all around! The fries were perfectly crisp, the tsaziki sauce was perfectly seasoned! And the gyro was cooked just right! I will definitely be a returning customer! Thanks for the great customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is good, but I've definitely had better. I got my usual Greek salad with gyro on top and it was mediocre at best. The dressing was yummy and the ingredients were fresh, but it was missing something I can't put my finger on. This place has no ambiance, but the staff is friendly and the prices aren't steep.   Overall, if you're dying and need Greek now, might as well give this place a try. Not the best, not the worst, but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"I gave this place 2 chances some years ago. Figured 3rd time is a charm.... NOT.  Maybe raised my expectations on the service part by 1 star, but the food ... not so much.  Got here during the weekday lunch hour rush. They quickly took my order I requested to go. I ordered the chicken shawarma and upgraded to greek fries meal with pop.  The shawarma chicken meat was under-seasoned and seemed like it was warmed up in a microwave. There was one pickle and one tomato slice on the actual pita bread making it a less of a bland flavor. There were no other sauces or anything else making the flavors connect on the store bought soggy pita bread  that held everything together. I poured the tzatziki dip and sprinkled some feta from the fries onto my pita and that still did not help. As for the \"greek fries\" they tasted stale along with the feta cheese, like it may have sat in a fridge a month too long past the expiration date and absorbed some other smell that baking soda in the fridge could not absorb, the oil the fries were fried in may possibly have needed to be changed cuz they just weren't right Salt couldn't even fix this problem. Perhaps if I went to McD's down the street and brought those fries here I would've been somewhat okay with the whole $12 I paid for this whack of a pita hell meal.  I'm set with this place. No more chances."}
{"text":"Must order the Mediterranean salad! I go here about twice a week during my lunch hour and the salad does not disappoint! The greek fries are amazing too! The staff is friendly and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. My go to is the Chicago Gyro with a side of fries. The meat is tender and the bread is warm and fluffy. Goes well together. Food is served quickly."}
{"text":"I had a gyro for lunch week of 2/3/15. First time there. Clean with plenty of tables and room. A nice setting. Staff behind counter(cooks) were not people friendly. No mgmt around. Seemed disorganized with a basic order.  Plenty Gyro lamb meat was not fried which is good. The sauce was ok but not Greek original gyro sauce... Pita was very hot but fresh and so were tomatoes. There was NO feta or lettuce put on Gyro which was a surprise. It was an average Gyro and nothing special. Pita Heaven it is not just needs to be a bit more friendly and include feta and lettuce on Gyros. Homemade Baklava would certainly help. I  had a Very Dry Baklava which was definitely not homemade or tasty. If the Greek Grill on Chandler is closed, it would be the only reason i would go back. Very average but i guess ok."}
{"text":"This place is great! I enjoy the chicken and hummus plate - is the perfect portion for lunch. Food is always hot and fresh. Highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Was waiting for some client related issues and saw the place.  Was going to go the fast food route but decided to try their gyros. Can't go wrong with a gyro.  This place is different than others I have been to. Really clean with plenty of seating and nice ambiance.  Seems to be family owned. Pricing was fair.  The gyro:  I was really impressed. The presentation was stellar. Normally a gyro is just pita, gyro meat, tomato and onion with tzatziki and that was the same with this one EXCEPT I suspect all the vegetables were cut fresh for my order. Look closely at the picture and you'll see what I'm talking about.  I'm really pleased with this place and must say that I will be back for certain. If you're in the area, you should really stop in."}
{"text":"Great food. Right across the street from my office, so come here to lunch often. Not 5 stars because they are a little more expensive. I get the chicken plate, which I love, however Gyro Express is $200 less and comes with a salad and drink. Costs extra here."}
{"text":"Love their gyro pita w/fries. Friendly, quick service, good food. The only gripe I have -- they don't offer a hummus AND tubuli plate. Its 1 order of hummus for 5.00 & 1 order of tubuli for 5.00"}
{"text":"Food is good...if they get your order correct which they rarely do any longer. Last time they forgot my tzatziki sauce on my gyro, are you kidding me??? Watch out for health violations, girls empty trash then wipe down tables and put together to go orders without washing hands. Used to love this place, really went downhill."}
{"text":"Everything is good,I always get the gyro and they give a ton of hand cut fries.the owner guy always seems a bit uptight whenever I see him,not very friendly to his customers or employees from what I've seen,but luckily the food makes up for him."}
{"text":"New to the area but place has some pretty bomb food.  Have the the steak gyro and steak shawarma and both are very very good.  My gf gets the falafel veggie plate and that's really good.  Also must try the baklava can't go wrong with it"}
{"text":"Pita Heaven has your decent, standard American-Greek food. It tasted good and the service was friendly and quick. I've only eaten here once since I'm not that big into Greek cuisine but I was satisfied. The prices were reasonable as well."}
{"text":"The place I think this is a converted sandwich shop if memory serves, but the new guys didn't let that stop them from making it feel new and cool.  It is an open kitchen so you can watch the cooks putting your food together and there is much steel used throughout - has a modern feel.  The only thing I'll knock if for is having a TV hanging on the wall.  Why do all restaurants feel like they MUST have a TV?  The food This is why you're here - the food.  My wife and I shared a chicken shawarma pita + fries and a falafel salad.  The salad had six generous falafel on a bed of romaine lettuce, feta cheese, tomato, onion, and a tangy lemon vinaigrette.  The falafel were well spiced and came alive when dabbed with the tahini? sauce that came with it.  The pita had many of the same ingredients as the salad, romaine lettuce, onion, tomato, and to top it off well seasoned chicken and a tzatziki that was dill-icious.  The crinkle cut fries were a good balance of crisp and fluffy.  It's hard to mess up fried potatoes.  The bottom line The lunch \"specials\" are really only a few cents off the regular prices, but for under $10 you walk away feeling like you've eaten real-whole-food, not some over processed junk from a tube.  I highly recommend the items that we sampled and I'm sure I'll be back to try the gyros."}
{"text":"good Gyros, ok fries. burgers are typical and good, but the cheese was awful!  i could definitely come back for the gyros. nice place! a good friendly service"}
{"text":"Pita Heaven has some delicious lamb gyros.  Get the combo because the fries are perfect and the cola goes well with the food.  Don't think, just go!  1 star deduction--price and the fact that it's not my favorite place in the entire world."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch bc a friend has been recommending it for quite some time. Ordered the Chicken Shawarma, Rice Pilaf, and Greek Fries. Tasty food. Very generous portions! Nice staff. They checked in on me a few times during my meal. Also, very clean place. Looking forward to trying more in the future."}
{"text":"This Chicago infused, pita, gyro, Italian beef heaven is amazing!!! The North Side Chicago owner, Frank, is so down to earth! I grew up on the North Side of Chicago, too. So, it feels like home to me! :-) I had the Chicken Shawarma. It was excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mediterranean salad with chicken. Everything was amazing. Dressing is light and flavorful. Chicken was grilled perfectly. Will definitely return! First time at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and got a Mediterranean Chicken Salad. It seemed to be acute little family owned business. The service was fine. It's one if those restaurants where you order at the front and they bring your meal to you. It took about 10 minutes to get my food. The salad was just okay. The chicken was very good - it was moist and had a slight Indian curry flavor to it. It also came with a delicious yogurt dill sauce. The downside was there was wayyy too much vinaigrette on the salad! The lettuce was drowning. Also the dressing was packed full of spices, which made it doubly intense.   While I was eating lunch around 1:30 pm, they decided to mop the floors with a very strong smelling cleaner, which made me a little sick to my stomach.   All that being said, I would go back to try a gyro since the chicken was so good."}
{"text":"I've tried this spot twice in the last 4 weeks hoping I caught them on a bad night but alas the second visit also not great. Sigh. 1st visit )  Service: I asked them to separate the sides from the meat.  They told me it has to come in one to go box.  Confused I tried explaining again, I wanted to order two different combos but out the sides together in containers.  No go....?!  So she had me order each item from the combo ala carte so they could be separated in the to go containers. Food: unimpressed. Nothing special. No wow this is so good. Don't get me wrong, I love Mediterranean, and this is near my house, to it warranted another go. 2nd visit)  Service: Stopped in with shopping bags and wanted a quick chicken gyro.  You would have thought I was disturbing them by asking to buy my dinner to go.  Because it was quick and frankly because last visit wasn't tasty and strange service I didn't tip on the chicken gyro.  Oh boy, stare down and comfort level dropped.  All I wanted was a chicken gyro, why is this place so strange.   Food: two stars because the tzatziki was good. However not in the sandwich. The actual chicken gyro? Well nothing special and the pita, fair.   Sadly, although close to my house, I'll pass on this spot due to two rounds of 'less than' in both service and food.  I want to feel welcome to an establishment and experience good tasting food."}
{"text":"I had the Chicago gyro and wasn't disappointed. Very fresh pita and tomatoes. The tzatziki was perfect not runny or too thick. It was clean but very hot inside. They could try turning up the AC, but the grills and ovens being on and it being 110 outside not much they can do."}
{"text":"My wife picked up a chicken pita and gyro to-go for us to eat at home. The chicken and gyro meat were and barely edible. Worst of all they forgot to include the tzatziki sauce in the bag, which we didn't find out till we got all the way home. We called to inform them and the best they could do is say \"we'll include an extra one next time\". The food was bland and dry without it. We do not recommend visiting this place."}
