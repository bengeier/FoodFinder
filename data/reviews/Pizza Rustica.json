{"text":"I enjoy this spot. Pizza is good. The BBQ Polo is my go to pie. The serve Krombacher beer, A great german beverage. They recently renovated and Im sure it was needed but perhaps they went a little too \"high end\". Over all a good experience for a restaurant I visit often."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely fantastic! My mother and I went there for a girls night out, and everything from the service to the food was amazing! We were served so well, and felt so welcomed by the staff. They have a must-try, delicious appetizer- grilled vegetable and goat cheese. It is a baked phyllo pastry filled with goat cheese topped grilled zucchini,eggplant & sweet pepper! We shared 2 scrumptious pizzas. We ended the meal with a NUTELLA PIZZA!! Such an amazing night, we would most definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The place looked nice so we thought we would give it a try while we were in town.  The host had us seated right away and our order was taken fairly quickly.  All down hill after that.  Our drinks were never brought out.  We had to ask twice.  Once they were out, we were forgotten.  It took an hour an a half to get us 3 pizzas and a salad.  Our waitress never checked on us and when we asked her for anything she looked annoyed.  She never filled our drinks even when asked and a second beer was next to impossible to get. Pizza was okay.  Crust was great, but the sauce was not very flavorful.  Will not go again."}
{"text":"We've been getting takeout from this place for a while, since it's right next to our condo. We really like their calamari and make it yourself pizza with Pesto sauce. The only reason I give this place a 2star is b/c of their newest owner. The last two times we've been in to pick up food ..the owner has been pretty openly and loudly  yelling at his employees for some reason or another. It's just not the way you treat ppl...all the more when customers can hear you. Stopping by to pick up food is one thing, but if you have to eat there and hear this guy basically degrading his employees..it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Peter Street location.  Saturday night, before Second City.  Ladies restroom out of order, men's faltered at least once, waited close to 50 minutes after ordering to be served, take out and delivery (?) customers clearly received preference, at least two vegan dishes used \"meat\" which they were out of, bill took about 10 to 15 minutes to be produced, forgot to check for gratitude drink discount, Natalie the server was kind, sympathetic, hustling  and likely over worked, less than a half dozen tables were occupied (maybe less than half full)  One dish had reportedly had the saghetti under finished, another had them over done. The funghi balsamico was a too heavy with balsamic, but had well done tiger shrimp  Won't be returning anytime soon. They clearly do not desire or require my business."}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy an Italian style thin crust pizza! My experience here was great and better than Terroni's. The servers here were friendly, attentive and quick! After 5 minutes from ordering, we immediately received our appetizers! The Bruschetta Rustica was very good as they used fresh tomatoes which were very juicy and felt very quenching in my mouth. The Ceasar Salad was not bad but a little on the cheesy side but I think that's an Italian signature! My main dish was the Tre Came and I found it very tasty! The crust was thin but it was still able to maintain it's crunchiness! The pizzas here are about 12 inches which is good to share between 2 people but as the pigs we were, my sisters and I ordered our own dishes and ended up bringing home leftovers but in the end I was able to try two more different pizzas! The Americano was good but a little less on the crunchy side while the Primavera tasted okay but had a very sour topping on it that we ended up removing (still can't figure out what that was) All and all, it was good and I enjoyed it very much!"}
{"text":"Outside seating nice. Waitress slow. Gorgonzola pear pizza good.  Rustic pizza was fair- over cooked."}
{"text":"I was a huge fan of the old pizza rustica. Supposedly there are new owners or management. Sometimes this is a good thing but in this case it created a divide between old and new guest experience.   There used to be familiar faces working and a family vibe. Pizzas and salads were always great. Bbq polo being my favorite. Delivery was also consistent.   These days the venue seems colder and not very approachable. The staff that I experienced do not care to build relationships. Lastly the food seems to have lost a bit of the care and effort that it once had.  As a local I still order from time to time but there is certainly room for improvement."}
{"text":"Best place for late night food! Pizzas were really good, bruschetta was pretty good and the service was great! Everyone who worked there was really friendly :)"}
{"text":"FRAUD ALERT -- they charged for food that they told us they could not deliver, and in numerous phone calls and emails have simply said \"manager not available\". We've had to pursue a formal fraud complaint through the bank. Nightmare!"}
{"text":"Recommended by hotel staff at the Marriott Residence Inn. Came in here pretty late for dinner on a Saturday night. There was one person there. I was afraid that was a bad sign. Ordered a Rustica Pizza, which was made of fresh tomato sauce with mozzarella, sundried tomtoes, sweet roasted peppers, mushrooms, goat cheese and topped with fresh-cut prosciutto. I really enjoyed that they didn't shred the prosciutto into tiny pieces. Rather, there were small piles of thinly sliced prosciutto on each slice of pizza. Well-thought out. PIzza was quite tasty all around.   Since we were visiting from out-of-town, I chatted up the lady behind the counter, Julie, who gave me some good recommendations on places to check out in Toronto. Granted there was only one other person in the store, she still genuinely took interest in what I asked her.   All-in-all, I recommend this place, at least on a quite night when the conversation is good and the pizza quite tasty."}
{"text":"What a crap shoot....Thin, tiny pieces with hardly any flavour to them (I think there was one piece of pepperoni per slice with tomato sauce on the \"Mediterranean\", boring salads with unoriginal dressing and a total rip-off. The diet coke was good."}
{"text":"Awesome homemade pizza!  Best pizza I have had in a long time!"}
{"text":"By far one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant.  Where do I begin? Waited almost 20 minutes until a waiter served us (had to get their attention or it would've been longer). Messed up my order. However the waiter did adjust the bill once I brought it to his attention. Anyway when we finally received our bill, the half litre of wine we ordered was on it's own. We had to pay for it as a separate transaction because our waiter punched it in wrong? To top it off a waiter named Doug threw a 'temper tantrum' by slamming his hand down on the bar when the waitress who was taking our payments on the debit machine asked him for assistance.  This was my first and last time at this place. Food was pretty good at least but there's a ton of restaurants in Toronto with better food and definitely better service.  This place needs to get its act together!"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza through JustEat and OVER TWO HOURS later, it arrived. Three phone calls to the restaurant were met with rude responses blaming the weather, a busy night, lack of drivers, etc. But TWO HOURS?? We're in the same city! And what happened to that fresh delivery? One staff member on the phone specifically assured me that despite the delay, the pizza would be warm upon arrival.Our pizza arrived frozen cold. As if it had been sitting in a box for the past TWO HOURS - shocking. Needless two say, Pizza Rustica deserves to go out of business. This restaurant is ridiculous! Order from literally anywhere else. What a joke!"}
{"text":"I write this review 1.5 hours into my delivery order.... still no pizza.  I can actually see the restaurant from my window yet they still can't get it right.  Time and time again I order from them thinking its going to change and each time they get it WRONG!!  Ive had orders messed up, orders late or orders cold from here time and time again yet I still come back.. why!?!  Go in and its ok but take out or delivery gets messed up"}
{"text":"Pizza Rustica used to be really good.  Quality pizzas for a decent price (not cheap but not ridiculous).    Recently I've had two meals and both have been terrible.    First of all the base on my gluten free pizza was like cardboard (they used to do a really nice crunchy one).   Secondly the toppings were quite lacking - I mean, the goats cheese was literally on one tiny piece of pizza.    To add insult to injury, the driver delivered the wrong pizza. When I called up to let them know I got a very tepid response.  Fortunately the driver corrected his error quite quickly, otherwise I either faced another lengthy wait for a replacement or I keep the one I received in error which was $4 cheaper than the one I ordered.  (no refund of difference was offered, not that $4 is going to break the bank, but it's the principle).   I wonder if Rustica has a new owner as previous experiences were superb - both delivery and in restaurant.    Unfortunately i won't be returning"}
{"text":"Definitely a place to go...  we went there after our show in December. Most places were closed at 11:30 p.m. or close to it...but we were so happy that Pizza Rustica was open.  the serving staff were courteous and very accommodating. they gave us so many options, changed the topping on the 'set' pizza.  when he realized that one of our guests could not drink (she is pregnant), he was very attentive because he is a father. He shared his loving stories about his son while serving good pizza and drinks.  The wood oven pizza was good, tasty... but man, their service is outstanding...  A nice gem of a place to go ..."}
{"text":"Got a hair in the pizza after almost an hour, no apologizes....wine was hot. No kid menu. Food quality wise vs cost: not good."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at the larger Pizza Rustica location. We had a pizza each which were a decent size and quality. For a pizza place it's not super authentic but not bad either. What really impressed was the service: the wait staff replaced a bottle of wine with no hassle and tracked down the last serving of dulce de leche cheesecake wrap (delish!) at their smaller location a few doors down on Wellington. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Pizza Rustica is our staple go to place for the last 11 years.   The Chicken Surpremo Panini is delicious and my usual go to. Even if I am walking by and want to take it home.  Cannelloni and other pasta are pretty good and freshly made.  We went last week to try the new menu items.  Lasagna was ok but the Calzone was really good.  Close to Skydome so easily accessible when you are in that area instead of the usual bars you get on Bremnar.  Service is super friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Went out for dinner with friends here and because the Jays Game was on we lucked out with it not being packed when we arrived. Have heard you definitely want a reservation typically unless you do not mind a wait.   The service was great, the food was excellent and the atmosphere was wonderful. This location has a really nice patio as well for smaller groups. We will definitely return in the future!"}
{"text":"Sorry guys. I ordered a margarita pizza and my friend order vegan bolognese spaghetti. Both were flavourless and tasted precooked just warmed up.   I really wanted to like this place. But the food was not good and the price was stupid. 45 bucks for a pinner pizza and a crappy pasta that tasted like the sauce came from a tin can. Get your shit together guys."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite lunchtime spot. Great food and excellent service. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case. Most. Painful. Lunch. Ever.   Six of us sat for lunch, half of us got our food after 20 mins (and it was cold), the other two at the 40 minute mark and the last one at the 55 minute mark.  Asked for the bill 30 minutes into lunch because we expected it was going to take some time and we were right; the bill came out 30 minutes after we asked for it.  The waitress comp'd the two desserts but it really could not undo the damage of the outing.  I don't think any one of us will be back."}
{"text":"I should of read the reviews before I ordered at this place. Never ask for delivery. Tried this for the first time. Ordered 2 pizzas only to arrive 1 hour and 30 min after I placed the order. Pizzas were cold when it was delivered. Called the restaurant and there is no manager at the restaurant? That's not right. For gourmet pizzas go to pizza libretto, not here."}
{"text":"I love this place.They even have a nice patio in the summer. On the inside, there's a nice ambiance with the lighting. It can get busy which is why the opened a second, more intimate location around the corner also on Wellington. The food is reliably great. The wine selection is good too and buying by the bottle is affordable. This place can wear many hats: it can be a romantic spot, a go-to girls night out location, or even a place to take your parents. I'd say it's best for doubles, trios or groups of four. Larger groups are an awkward fit because it's not very spacious inside."}
{"text":"This is a great little Italian restaurant in downtown. Even though it's in the heart of Toronto downtown the prices are quite reasonable but what makes it stand out are the portions, very generous. The quality and taste of the food served is pretty good. The only problem I had with the place was that they served us a frozen, not chilled but actually frozen, Tiramisu cake. If this happens to you inform your server right away as the cake is not suppose to be frozen. Besides that everything else was excellent. I will definitely be going back to this place in the future."}
{"text":"This review is for a take-out order through Just-Eats.  3 pizzas - Tre Carne;  Beef and Gorgonzola;  and the Sausage Calabrese pizza.  The order took about an hour to arrive (which was exactly what the Just-Eat app had said).  They were still hot on delivery, and toppings were relatively generous.    Even though they describe their pizzas as 12\" thin crust in their menu, I would describe the crust as \"medium\" in thickness.  I typically prefer much thinner crust pizzas, but Pizza Rustica's crusts had a nice chew.  The Beef and Gorgonzola was surprisingly tasty - the cheese was not overpowering, and the pizza also had mushroom which added flavour.  Tre Carne and the Sausage Calabrese were, as expected, somewhat greasy, but good!  Just-Eats had a promo where the menu was 50% off, so with delivery charge, tax and tip, the order for 3 pizzas (12\", so the size of your typical medium pizza) was around $37!  Not a bad deal!"}
{"text":"Ate here on 11/07/13 - I was starving and had just endured a long ass flight. I'm not the most patient plane person. After many recommendations, I decided to walk to Pizza Rustica after checking in to my hotel (first trip to Toronto ever). I automatically loved the decor, and the staff was very friendly. After looking over the menu and not being able to decide (many delicious choices), our server helped my friend and I pick. I got a pizza and my friend got the spaghetti and meatballs. We both looooved our food & had great conversation with our server. I'm just sad that this place isn't near my home. Definite place to eat if you're in the area. Yummers! With my tummy so happy, I completely forgot about being grumpy n tired from my flight and ended up taking a long walk around King St. Great start to my Toronto Trip. Thank you Pizza Rustica!"}
{"text":"Great location especially for anyone going to CN Tower or ball game. Extensive menu but perhaps too much. Perhaps it would be easier/better to have a 'build-your-own' option.   Staff was not attentive - perhaps since the owner was fighting with his staff in front of customers - and failed to even to fill up water glasses. Final straw was when I asked for a $100 to be broken for the bill and waitress intentionally only gave me $10s. Based on the service we got there was no way she was getting a 25% tip so she ended up with the loose change in my pocket"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE COSTUMER SERVICE!!!!!! I placed an order on line on Pizza Rustica's own website ant 9:15 pm because I was starving, by 11:15 I still DID NOT received to order!!!!! When I called at 11:20pm to inquire about my food, I was given the run around: the girl on the other side of the phone first blamed it on JustEat, but I did not order from there, then she said that it was the fault of the people at the bar because it was them responsible for my order, she transfer me there where I was told that they were responsible only for pick up; then I called back  delivery but nobody picked up, so I called right back from another phone, now someone picked up, the same girl try to tell me that I had probably placed to order on the phone with on other person, I reiterated to her that order was placed on line and that I had also received an email confirming the order; at this point I asked her to look up my order, she could not find it, finally sho found it and I inquired a out the status, it was not even out!   I ask to CANCEL IT and refound me my money, she said she  old not do it but that one of her managers would have called me the following day for the refound. One of the manager called me in the afternoon and  offer me a refound, not immediately but in a few days, and told me that they would give me $5.00 for the inconvenience! SERIOUSLY $5, WHOLE $5, NOT EVEN ENOUGH FOR A DESERT!!!!!! I have other few other times from Pizza Rustica, and this knot the first time that they screw up my order!!!! IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO EAT TADAY DO NOT ORDER FROM PIZZA RUSTICA!!!"}
{"text":"Their BBQ chicken pizza is the best in the city.   Deeelish!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Waited 15 mins for a server, ordered right away and the food was still slow. Food was cold and so was the server. Hostess was very nice. Should have gone to Cora's."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious. Some of the best in the city. Unfortunately the atmosphere completely spoils the experience. Hillbilly country twang blares over the speakers.  Major league sports are on every screen. If this place played Italian music and showed old Italian movies on the large screen I would definitely return. As it stands now, it is so off putting I would avoid."}
{"text":"Worst run restaurant I've ever been to. This place is a joke. I really don't know what to say except please do yourself a favour and don't go there. It will be out of business in no time."}
{"text":"Came in here at 3pm on a Monday. My wife and I were the only ones in the restaurant.   Ordered the Tre Carne pizza  and soup to start. I had the Italian wedding and my wife had tomato ravioli.  Soup came fast and very very hot.  Pizza followed not long after the soup and was very good.  Thin, crispy crust, fresh meat and lots of provolone cheese.  We were in and out within half an hour"}
{"text":"Great place to dine before a Second City show.  Bruschetta and Calamari are both great starters.  Huge selection of awesome thin crust pizza.....both we ordered were outstanding. Seafood pasta and cajun pollo penne were both full flavored and worth coming back for."}
{"text":"some of the other reviewers are obviously unfamiliar with with the concept of THIN CRUST pizza .... If you want deep pan creasy north American style pizza don't go to Rustica ... If you appreciate Italian style thin crust pizza and you happen to be in the area give Rustica a try"}
{"text":"Good service, god food. Greatest pizza ever? No, but a good, tasty thin crust. We got the pizza rustica without the pancetta and it was unique and flavorful. There was something sweet about it, which was the only taste that did not appeal to me. Caesar tasty, but a little more dressing than I'm used to. Our kids liked their respective pizza (Marguerita) and spaghetti and meatballs.  Only 'con' of the experience was the iced tea was pre-sweetened. Is that a Canadian thing?? Why not bring it unsweetened and let us add sugar or splenda ourselves --- or not add it at all, which is the way my family and I prefer it. Enjoyed the patio dining on this delightful summer evening."}
{"text":"Disappointing and inconsistent. Ordered pesto pasta this time because Rustica Pizza i got before was pretty good. The pasta was mediocre and swimming in oily pesto sauce."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas, and they arrived looking cobbled together and tasting cold as though they had been sitting in my fridge overnight. So brutal. Hopefully this was a one time occurance."}
{"text":"I went for dinner after months of not going. In the past the toppings on the pizza were lacking. So the topping amount has improved but the restaurant service was nonexistent. Our waitress never served us water or table bread. 4 out of the 8 drinks were sent back because of dead bugs in them or old tasteless wine.  Seems that flies have taken over the restaurant. We were swatting flies all night. It took away from our meal. Makes you think where these flies came from and how much time they spent in the food and drink prep area. With so many restaurants in the King West district, we definitely will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had gone here for an early dinner for my sister's birthday.  I liked the ambiance of the place, I for one thought it was nice- the tiling on the wall, the colours used, even that big tub of Nutella (only because I like it though!) I ordered the \"Penne A La Vodka\".  I thought it was delicious with the right amount of spice for my liking; however, for my fiancé it was a little too spicy for him.  I was expecting a bit more of an Alfredo sauce but whatever, I had no more time or patience to complain considering that we waited for what seemed like over half an hour for our dishes and even just to pay for the bill seemed like it was taking forever as well. I'm not really sure why everything had taken so long considering it was a smaller spot and it didn't seem overwhelmingly busy however I'm just one person not knowing what other customers had been ordering. My sister's boyfriend and his friend had ordered a pizza as well and they said it was delicious. In other words, food was great, just took incredibly long to have it brought to the table and then to pay."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza I've ever had, but I was impressed with the amount of selection as well as the number of vegan options. Thought it would be fun to try during Winterlicious with a group of coworkers - unfortunately the service was rather slow as there was only one server working. Ended up being a two hour lunch."}
{"text":"food's ok. server didn't seem very interested in serving.  slightly expensive.  mussels weren't that good."}
{"text":"This has to do with their take out/delivery service.  If i  could give zero starts I would.  The worst food and service I ever experienced. I ordered a Margerita Pizza,ceasar salad.  The delivery guy showed up( an hour after I ordered with restaurant across the street and empty.  I could see from my hotel room,)  The pizza was burnt,cold and tasteless.  The salad came with no silverware and the delivery guy forgot the iced tea.    When I called to speak to the manager,I was actually given the cook.  I was told there was no manager.     This place is a joke.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Horrible the basil was rotten, black, and the chef did not know what \"regular Mozzarella\" is and they run a pizza place. When brought it to their attention no apologies. Ridiculous!! This place is beyond me... Is there a way to give negative ratings? These guys inspired me to add a review ;)"}
{"text":"Wow, surprised this place survives so long.  Pizzas were so so average, not even baked properly, everything on the pizza were watery, including the pork.  Prosciutto toppings felt like they were soaked in salt water, never had prosciutto so salty.  Friend had the veggie panzorotti, it didn't even seem like the vegetables were cooked properly and it just looked so plain that he had to use up almost the one container of chilli pepper to spice things up.  I was expecting something better than Boston Pizza which is closer by, you'd expect that because it's a speciality pizza shop but I gotta say it's one of the worst I've tried.  To be honest and not to sound harsh, I rather have Pizza Pizza over this.  I would take Boston Pizza over this any time of the day.  Service is great though, always on top of refills."}
{"text":"I haven't been for years, its nothing like it was back in the day. Server was friendly the pizza was mediocre at best. My mom ordered salad with grilled chicken, she took one bite, I could tell by the expression on her face, that it would be the last. After tasting it for myself I realised why, this chicken has nothing to do with grilling and everything to do with microwaving."}
{"text":"Good food but not the best (the smoked salmon sandwich was actually one of the best),  excellent choice for casual and non-expensive dinner with friends after/before a show, good and fast service... I have been there a couple of times, and no regret!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times and on both occasions the experience was less than ideal. Pizza they serve is supposed to be premium but Ive had way better at places like dominos and pizza pizza :/  It always smells like burnt bread inside and outside the store whenever I pass by, they should seriously consider installing some proper ventilation to address this issue. Also on both occasions I visited place was entirely dead. Decor is mediocre.  From what i remember the place wasnt the cleanest. On our second visit we were sat next to the main windows and upon immediate arrival we noticed a big dead fly on the one of the windows metal panels. None of the staff seemed to care enough though as that thing remained there for the remainder of our visit.   Havent visited in two summers now and wont be going back again."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza for $10 and half price apps between 4-6 weekdays. Can't recommend this place enough. All pizza recipes that we've tried are perfectly balanced and full of high quality ingredients."}
{"text":"One of the most amazing place for pizza in the town. The menu is great which accommodates many restricted diets as well. I definitely recommend because of service and the pizza!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was half empty. We were seated fairly soon which seemed like a default good start. But our server was no where to be found. From the time we closed our menus (the universal sign for \"I'm ready to order\"), to the time a server came to take our order was 20 minutes. Not kidding. Another server had to notice and tell our server to take our order. When she came around, she was taking away our menus while she said, \"what would you like?\". I had to pry the menu out of her hands to open it up and point to the one I wanted. So did my dining partner. It was awkward. She was guessing what we wanted as she took the menus away. She didn't even patiently tell us about their specials of the day. I don't think she even cared.  When our water glasses arrived, one of them was still dirty with some pizza sauce on the lip/sip area of the glass. We sent it back. When our food arrived, we didn't have cutlery so we waited another 5 minutes for that, while our food got cold. The food itself was okay. Nothing to complain about.  We waited another 20 minutes to get our bill, and finally when I had my card out to pay, our server was no where to be found to take my money. I could have gotten up and walked out without paying and no one would have noticed, but I would never do that. Finally I walked over to the take out counter to pay. It was the least pleasant experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! I ordered the braised beef ravioli via Just Eat and I got a few pieces of ravioli absolutely covered in a dark green liquid dye.  I was so shocked at the obvious over-use of food colouring that I poured the green liquid into a white container and took a picture (I wish I could add a photo to this review) I called to complain and they told me I had to deal with Just Eat.  No offer to send me a replacement dish or a dessert - nothing.  Owners name (I asked) is Rocky."}
{"text":"Peter St location.  I've eaten here a few times but last night the service was terrible.  I found a groupon for 3 course meal for two for $49 so I thought this would be good for Mother's Day dinner.  Perhaps groupon users are 2nd class citizens but since they are a method to advertise for business owners you would think you would be treated well.   We had reservations, sat down and ordered drinks and appetizers  and our main course. The groupon said it covered appetizers up to $15. I ordered the brucshetta which is $8 with the goat cheese (extra $3) which in my books is understanding is under $15 but they made me pay the $3 extra  We got our appetizers and a family sat down beside us. They got their drinks, meals, bill,paid and left. We didn't get our main course until 15 minutes after they left.  We finished our food (which was good), and waited another 15 mins before our waitress came back and we requested the dessert menu. It took another 25 minutes before she came back (I actually had to ask another waitress to order our dessert)  there were only 4 tables filled at this time so it was not busy.   Even though repeatedly we asked for drink refills, we got one refill after 4 times asking. Of course by the time our dessert arrived we had empty glasses and I refills again.  I've recommended this restaurant in the past but I won't do that anymore and I'm not  sure  if I will ever return.  If the groupon was to attract patrons, this experience did the total opposite."}
{"text":"Placed an order over the telephone for delivery. Worst customer service I've ever received!! Was told 45 minutes and didn't arrive for over an hour and a half! I live 5 minutes away. Was also charged $4.50 to \"add\" mozzarella and mushrooms to my veal sandwich however the menu says it comes with peppers, mushrooms, cheese and sauce."}
{"text":"They have a pretty extensive vegan menu for a pizza restaurant, so this needs to be noted for vegan Yelpers in the future when they search it in the search bar--- VEGAN VEGAN VEGAN VEGAN VEGAN  I think I would've had a better experience but this time I really felt as if I was the server at this restaurant. We had a weird interaction dynamic because she was pretty cold to me and I felt like I needed to compensate for it by being super polite and nice... I came in and had to hunt down the waitress and seat myself. I tried to order stuff but had to search for her again. I finished eating and was ready to pay my bill but had to stand up and look for her again. The Elusive Server was nowhere to be found when I was done paying and it was weird operating the instructions on the credit card reader that should've been done by her because she disappeared halfway through the process. It should be noted that there were only two other tables in the entire restaurant so she wasn't busy or anything? Pizza was good though : )~"}
{"text":"Extremely poor service and food was average. Definitely won't be back! To the owner of this place, train your employees better so they don't make the customer stand there for 20 minutes for their takeout when it was sitting on the bar counter the whole time, but server forgot.  Also to the owner, customers don't like to see dirty table rags on the bar counter next to their pizza takeout order. It was very disgusting. Dirty table rags should be kept out of customer sight. Common sense.  Came here on a Thursday night. It was empty inside. I  was the only customer inside. I came to pick up my takeout order. I was craving pizza and ordered their margherita pizza. The experience of picking up my takeout order was AWFUL.  Once I came inside, no one greeted me. One server is counting her cash at the front of the door, and another male server who is clearly new and lacks training is running around. I had to flag the male server and tell him I'm here to pick up my pizza order.  I told him I what I had ordered. The male server who is clearly not trained properly gave me the wrong order. He gave me 2 pizzas and a pasta. I told him that's not my order!! I ordered ONE pizza, one item, that's all!  I'm standing in the restaurant angry as I wait for my takeout. The Indian chef came out and cleared up the whole confusion for the server. The chef was yelling at the male server in front of the customer. The chef looked very angry at the server. The chef said he had given the server my pizza takeout a long time ago and it's sitting on the counter. The male server told the chef \"oh sorry, I forgot\".  This is not the kind of service i expect from a pizza restaurant located on blue jays way.   I really don't recommend anyone to dine here or order takeout. Your food will take forever and the service is very very very very terrible!"}
{"text":"YUM!  My favorite meal that we had in Toronto.    Things are definitely cozy in here during the peak dinner hour--lots of people at lots of tiny tables--but the lively, warm atmosphere was just right on a chilly, dark night.    The pizza was fantastic--I went with the house special, the Pizza Rustica.  The crispy thin crust, fresh ingredients, and general non-greasiness reminded me of pizzas I ate in Rome.  Since we had a huge calamari appetizer (it was pretty good; not the best I've ever had) and each ordered our own pizza, SK and I thought we'd be carrying out some leftovers.  ....oops.  Didn't happen.   This place hits a nice balance of being both trendyish--crowded, lively, lots of young, sophisticated urbanites out mingling--and warm, comfortable, and pretty reasonably priced.  Would definitely go back, but....to have the same thing, or try something new?    Hm--guess I'll have to come back at least twice."}
{"text":"Pretty horrible. I ordered a pasta, took a few bites and stopped eating because I couldn't stomach it. Super strange texture for the spaghetti- almost like it had been frozen/put in the fridge and then reheated. Lots of sauce but still pretty bland. Not worth 20+ dollars for something that tastes like it had been sitting out for days. I had to go grab something else for lunch.   My friends enjoyed their pizzas, they were just a bit soggy. Service was standoffish and checking their phone."}
{"text":"I feel the need to start off this review by saying that I am *not* one to post negative reviews for mediocre experiences, but my experience today with Pizza Rustica was so completely infuriating, I have to.  If this post is understandably too long to read, the short version of the story is that half of our order was not delivered and the restaurant (and specifically, head chef) handled the situation with complete disregard for customer service and an abhorrent attitude.  I placed an order through UberEats at 8:00 pm on Saturday, April 9th for a pizza and a panini. When the order arrived, the driver said that a woman at the restaurant told her that they no longer made the panini so they did not include it in the order.  I found this to be strange because I was not contacted by the restaurant to see if we wanted to swap the panini for something else.  I thanked and tipped the driver and called Pizza Rustica to find out whether they would be sending something in substitution or if they would offer us a refund.  When I called, I spoke with a young woman who seemed to be incredibly friendly and helpful and went to ask the kitchen why the panini wasn't sent out. When she came back on the phone, she said that they make the panini and would never have told the Uber driver that they didn't so it must have been ordered from the other Pizza Rustica restaurant on the same street. I asked her if she had the telephone number for the restaurant. She said that she didn't, but that I could probably find it online. She told me to call back if I didn't figure out the problem. I thanked her and hung up the phone.  I couldn't find another Pizza Rustica on the same street online, so I called Pizza Rustica back to double-check that they didn't have the telephone number. I was speaking with another woman who said that the first lady gave her the low-down on my order issue. She said that she could give me the number, but they probably wouldn't be open because it was a catering service. (?) So I said \"so, the order came through your restaurant? Do you have a record of it?\"  She put me on hold and went to talk to the kitchen about the order.  Five minutes later, she puts me on the phone with the head chef. He told me that they definitely gave the panini to the driver, and that the problem was with UberEats and not them. He gave me the telephone number for JustEats customer service (*not the same delivery service*).  Before I planned on getting off the phone, I asked him if he was 100% certain that this was the case because I didn't want to contact UberEats not having my facts straight. He said he was going to triple-check with the kitchen.  When he came back, he said that he now thinks the order wasn't punched in. He put me on hold for 5-10 minutes while he looked through his computer to confirm this. He concluded that could be the problem, but he wasn't certain. He told me about an UberEats order from the day before where they messed up. I said \"I just want to see how this situation can be rectified, will you be sending the order or can you offer me a refund?\"  He said that he can't send a delivery driver and he can't offer a refund because the payment does not go through him (totally understandable). He then said that he is super busy with the Jays home opener (which was the day before). I said I don't really care about the Jays home opener, I just want this problem to be fixed (through refund by UberEats or resending the correct order). He said \"oh you don't care about the Jays home opener? Listen lady, I don't need your tone and don't have to put up with this\" and hung up the phone.  I was given the complete runaround from Pizza Rustica with three different stories as to why the food wasn't delivered. I still don't know why for sure, but my assumption is that it was because the chef and employees of Pizza Rustica are completely unaccountable, lazy, unprofessional and can't handle a two-item delivery order.  Who would also rather tell a bunch of half-assed lies than admit that the mistake was a fault of their own."}
{"text":"To start the veg and cheese appetizer was very good but sadly that was it. The margarita pizza was burnt and flavourless and since there's so many cheaper pizza places around (literally) I expected more."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Very glad we stopped in on a very cold afternoon....We also had very good service. The food however- not so great. The pizza is pretty bland and the Caesar salad was just passable. However, I could see this as a great place to come by and get a drink or two and a snack.   So we had a late lunch and as it hits 2PM, they have 3.50$ martinis that normally are 11$! They were really really good! Maybe we had a more fortunate experience than others, but the bartender/manager (Persian guy who normally works at the main restaurant) made some great drinks. It was a good place to sit and chill for a bit during a really bad storm in March. While the food was not great, glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"So where to begin with this place...   My friend decided to try this restaurant for her birthday this past weekend. We were all looking forward to trying it out, but we sure do wish we went elsewhere.   She made reservations well in advanced and was told that her party of 16 could be accommodated comfortably. When in fact, the party was split into two different tables, and we all felt disconnected. Upon arrival the table wasn't ready and had to wait an additional half an hour.  We were all from Markham, so getting downtown took us a total of two hours, due to traffic, construction, rainy weather and trying to find parking in downtown Toronto. A few of us were running late and that's when the owner approached my friend in an aggressive and disrespectful manner. He continued to argue and threaten the guests stating that he was going to take the table away, when in fact it wasn't our fault that he had double booked. He made himself look like an ass to protect his ego.  He was screaming to the point where he started getting into our guests faces, kept getting close, arguing and tried to take the reserved tables away.  Everyone in the restaurant was staring at us, even foot traffic stopped to look in. It was humiliating and definitely killed the vibe for the night. He told us that food would be out in 10 minutes, which is impossible. He said that with our party we would be served and out of there within an hour. There is no way. How is that possible when our appetizers took about 45 minuted and our entrees took about an hour at most.  He was screaming at his staff, which you could tell made his poor employees look tense and uncomfortable. He also would stare us down which made us feel uncomfortable. He walked and paced throughout the restaurant. And the part that disgusted me the most is that he was standing in the (already small) kitchen with his arms crossed, scrolling through his phone, with no uniform, no hair net, no apron nothing, while his hard working staff were trying to do their jobs.   Our server Doug was the greatest. He did whatever he could to make us feel accommodated and welcomed, unlike the owner.   I have worked in the industry for about five years, serving customers, and handling food and never have I ever treated someone with such disrespect. It's such a shame that he has turned away so many people.   The pear and gorgonzola pizza was great, but that's about the only thing. If you're craving pizza there are so many amazing pizza restaurants in downtown, Toronto that I would suggest going elsewhere.   Someone as foul, rude and disrespectful as this man does not deserve your business. He does however need to back and take some courses on hospitality and customer service, because this is not in fact how you build customer relations.   I recommend you to not visit this restaurant. It's not worth the trek, time and money."}
{"text":"I recently went here for a work outing with about 10 people. I never really reach to go to pizza places or Italian restraints as I don't eat cheese (crazy right) but I was pleasantly surprised to see they had a vegan/veggie part of their menu!  Funny enough I didn't end up getting one of the Daiya cheese pizzas but instead I got a spicy penne pasta, which sadly wasn't spicy at all and I think they forgot some ingredients that were listed. It was still pretty okay though,sometimes you just need that kick of spice, am I right?  Also I don't want this to be a negative nancy post but everytime we would order a cocktail the waitress asked us how to make it and didn't seem to sure about any of the questions we asked. She could have been new though and we have all been there! But then again it was an Italian restaurant and I asked her for Campari and she had no idea what I was asking for. (in the end I got it though yay)  Over all I was expecting a bit more for the price point but it was still a great night out. I think the Nutella Pizza solved all problems in the end."}
{"text":"Sidebar: I wish yelp had half marks - but then again, that's like a can of worms...if I could give a half, then I'd want to give a quarter...lol.  Whoever wrote the copy for Pizza Rustica's website is really, really cheesy and has a poor command of the English language.  I mean seriously...here's a quote:  \"Smart service with infectious ambiance and a fresh vibe, we create an environment where you and your friends can feel at home, relax and be free. With the right mix of homestyle cooking, great wine, company, and atmosphere create great moments!\"  Seriously?  Ewwww.  I'm just going to pretend the website doesn't exist.  Because frankly, I believe you can choose what exits in your world.  I've done that...with people too.   It's amazing how I can wipe out an entire population.    I enjoy Pizza Rustica for many reasons.  It's an easy place to grab a bite to eat.  They have a ton of choices.  It's reasonably priced.  It's family owned.  It's also \"Toronto's hippest pizza joint\".  Says who?  They do.  I don't agree, nor do I disagree.  I plead the fifth.  Their main location is across from SoHo and it's quaint, dark and burgandy.  Everything is a really terrible shade of this colour.  I frankly think they need a decor overhaul.  Their other location is not as bad.  It's around the corner on Wellington, near John, but is better for take-out.  Last night I met up with Nettypants.  Nettypants is like a fiery ball of sunshine - equal parts giggle and panache. We shared the Fragola Salad because it's Nettypants' \"favourite\" salad.  It has strawberries (which she loves), candied pecans (which I love), goat cheese (who doesn't love cheese), cherry tomatoes (negligible), and creamy poppy seed dressing (which is her favourite).  I like their pizza but if pasta is on a menu...I'll (almost) always get pasta.  No shock then that I got the Seafood Linguine.    My only complaint is the sauce to pasta ratio.  Way too much sauce.  There's a pool under there.  Too too much is never good, but extra extra is awesome.  For example, more shrimp and scallops in my dish would have been extra extra, but pasta drowning in sauce?  That's too too much.  (Still doesn't make sense?  I'll put it to you like this: you know how some guys have shirtless photos...yet they really should NOTand then they post that sh*t on Facebook...that's too too much.  But say you're invited to a pink-themed party, and while you detest the colour, everything is really pink.  Like this girl is not messing around - even the bathroom towels are pink, as is the hand soap...well now, that's extra extra.  And extra extra is awesome...it's like attention to detail to the 10th power.)  Sorry, back to Pizza Rustica...  Nettypants got the Pollo Pesto without mushrooms.     All in all, it was a nice dinner out.  I will point out that I did not like our waitress.  She was pleasant...on the surface...but deep down something was irking her.  I'm off pasta for a while because I love it too much.  As for my pizza craving?  For now, I'll shove my face full of Pizza Nova because at baseline I'm more cheap and cheerful than rustic and romantic.  I'm also extra extra."}
{"text":"- not bad pizza in a sea of towering concrete and glass - their rustica (prociutto, goat cheese, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes) pizza and rosemary potato bianco pizza are my two favs. esp the rosemary one... hmmmm... - bonus is that they deliver... downside is that their delivery time takes forever (\"at least an hour\"... is what i was quoted ones)"}
{"text":"So, let's start with first impressions.  The decor is trying to be upscale but really looks quite cheap, because the materials are cheap.  All black and white and sparkly with absolutely no warm touches.  This feeling of coolness carried through to the service which felt slightly condescending.  We ordered the cajun calamari to start because I really wanted to try it, unfortunately it was slightly rubbery so overcooked yet somehow managed to have mushy wet breading as well.  The dipping sauces were sour cream and frank's red hot sauce and the calamari was sprinkled with generic cajun spice mix.  Not sure what I was expecting but I was unable to eat more than three pieces so we sent it back with all those complaints and all they did for us was take 15% off that item, so all in all I paid about $11 or so for an item we didn't even eat.  All the server had to say was \"that's weird, this is my favourite dish here, usually it's quite good.\"  yeah, thanks for nothing. That said, I gave this place 2 stars because the pizza was quite good, however, the beer selection leaves quite a lot to be desired which I find shocking for a pizza place.  All in all, if you want decent pizza and don't want to travel too far if you're in town for a game, you might be happy enough with this place if you just stick to pizza and don't mind drinking swill.  Oh, sorry I forgot they do have Guinness on the menu but were out of it that night, also not on tap. The place doesn't even have a comment card or guest survey, so that combined with the service and the pathetic discount tells me they just don't care about their guest's experience at all and are ok with getting walk-ins only.  Worst business plan ever, manager should be fired. I was also pretty shocked when I got the bill, approx $100 for two people to eat pizza and drink a couple beers.  I will never be back."}
{"text":"Small pizza for a huge price. No where near worth it. I paid close to $30 for a pizza just bigger than a personal size. Go with anywhere else."}
{"text":"Pizza Rustica... Your food is pretty good, your service really annoyed me the last time we got takeout.  Around dinner time my husband dropped me off to pick up our order, and when I approached the counter to pick it up, I was passed around by servers like a hot potato. I was confused as to why I wasn't getting my food, as I could see it from where I was standing.  One individual told me sorry, only the person who took my order over the phone could ring me in... Ok.  She came over about 5 minutes later.  When she passed me the debit machine to pay, she said \"I have to add 3 percent.\"  Confused and a little bit put on the spot, I said \"why?\" And she explained hat she needed to add that, or else she would have to pay that to Pizza Rustica from her own pocket.  Still a bit stunned and confused, I let her go ahead and do that.  I don't usually tip on takeout, and was left feeling annoyed, especially after having waited so long to pick up my order as people dodged serving me, and my husband had to keep circling the block waiting for me.  I remembered afterwards that some restaurants do this- take a percentage on every order, whether the server gets a tip or not.    I'm annoyed, because clearly this encourages the servers to avoid those waiting for takeout, so as to not have to pay the house out of their own pocket...  Additionally, annoyed that the server so casually tried to add the tip... You took a job here, and take out orders are part of the job.  It's unfortunate, but the customer shouldn't have to pay because of crappy management policies!  All in all, I have no real desire to return, since there are so many other choices downtown Toronto.  Don't offer takeout if you're not willing to facilitate it!"}
{"text":"This chain is on the major avoid list. The owners are weasels. Heck ask them if they've ever stored dog food in their freezer. Watch em try and weasel outta that one.. If only the food could save this review but we all know that's not going to happen. Nothing is fresh here. An overpriced dirty fail."}
{"text":"This one is a hit or miss for me. My first order here was the Caesar Salad, and it was fantastic. I was really pleasantly surprised when someone at the restaurant called me (it was a takeout order) to let me know the dressing wasn't vegan when they noticed I selected vegan meatballs as the topper for my salad. I'm not vegan, but I am someone who appreciates thoughtful customer service! The salad was absolutely delicious, with soft croutons and the right amount of Parmesan (I routinely find salads are either stuffed to the brim with cheese OR provide it in paltry supply). I have had a lot of Caesars and this one was memorable. My next venture was into the realm of pasta - I had an Alfredo and was impressed. It's the kind of thing that is perfect for you if you're in the mood for a greasy, high calorie, indulgent experience (healthy folk be warned). I had it with chicken and liked it a lot - got it again a few days after. Recently, however, I tried another Alfredo (with broccoli) and it had a very strong flavour (I think it was the broccoli) that was not particularly appetizing. The margherita pizza was also disappointing, unfortunately - very little cheese in proportion to how much sauce is piled on. And the crust is very thick for what is advertised as \"thin crust\". Overall, an okay experience - some winners on the menu but other items that don't quite please."}
{"text":"Not authentic Italian. Not worth the slightly-high prices. Pizza mediocre at best. Pasta dishes BLAND. Five friends and we went here and each sample of each other's plates... Eight dishes in total and nobody thoroughly enjoy any of them."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to Pizza Rustica for dinner with my cousin as I had purchased a deal via Teamsave (spend $19 get $40).  We arrived at about 815pm on a Saturday night, with no reservation. The restaurant was half full and we were seated promptly.   I went with the caesar salad ($7) to start, and ordered the Americano (green peppers, mushrooms, pepperoni, spicy salami) pizza ($14) for my main. My cousin ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza ($14) and had a beer on tap to drink (specific brand name is escaping me at the moment).   The caesar salad was excellent. It was served in a large bowl, with crisp romaine lettuce, creamy garlic dressing and herbed croutons (a slice of garlic toast was served on the side). It was a fair sized portion, definitely large enough to share.  The pizza is served on a thin crust and comes in one size (must have been approx 10 inches (the equivalent to a small domino's pizza).  It's definitely large enough for the average person (I could have shared mine and still had enough). Both myself and my cousin did not finish ours and took a portion of our pizza's home in a doggy bag.   I asked for my pizza to be made without the spicy salami and the waitress obliged my request. I was hoping that she might have made a suggestion like adding another topping, but no suggestion was made. My personal preference when it comes to pizza is for there to be a lot of toppings. I'd rather have more than less. This is not the style of pizza that one will find at Pizza Rustica. That being said, I am not going to penalize the restaurant because my tastes differ from how it is made.  This was not my first visit to Pizza Rustica, but was the first visit in quite a long time. I had a sample of my cousin's choice, the BBQ Chicken, and it was exactly as I remember. The sauce that is used is quite tangy and works quite well with the chicken and asiago cheese.  Our total bill came to $47 (excl. tip). We were in and out in a little more than an hour.  A few minor criticisms: - while the service was prompt and friendly, it was noted that they delivered our pizzas before I was finished eating my salad. This didn't faze me, however it is something that should be mentioned as some people are very picky about something like that. - when the bill arrived, both myself and my cousin presented $20 bills and asked the waitress if she could provide change for both of us. The waitress responded that they did not have enough change in the restaurant and that we would have to go to the corner store next door to get change. What restaurant can't change two $20s?!?  I know that some prior reviews have commented on it not being quite as good as Pizza Libretto or Terroni. I don't think it's appropriate to compare Pizza Rustica with the other two. The only time I've dined at Pizza Libretto, I had to wait over an hour for a table, and the pizza was marginally better. Terroni in my opinion is more of a higher end Italian restaurant that serves items like Osso Bucco or Veal Parmigana.   Conclusion: I would probably give a rating of 3.5 out of 5, but since Yelp doesn't allow for half stars, I'll be generous and give it a 4 out of 5. That being said, I'm not sure how quickly I'll return. That's more a result of there being so many other choices in the city and the fact that it's not the cheapest of places (the main reason that I went was because of the Teamsave coupon) to dine."}
{"text":"This pizza goes on a list of the worst margarita pizza I've ever had. It was like half way through making it they realized they ran out of cheese, so they emptied a can of cheap parmesan on it to hide how bad it was.   It was falling apart and didn't even have toppings to weigh it down. They messed up the size and shape of the crust and instead of fixing it they just closed the box and folded the pizza over itself.   On top of how horribly thrown together the pizza was, it took them over an hour to get it to me, one block away. You'd think all that time would go into making something that wasn't what a 4 year old in the Midwest would come up with.   Place used to be good, now you'll have better luck getting frozen pizza than ordering from here."}
{"text":"Service is fine. Pizza was burnt and some of the vegetables were raw. Serving wine was a second thought. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Visited Wed Sept 14 for dinner.   The place was almost empty, it was getting late. Service was acceptable, not sure if management has changed or not over the years.   Pros - Cajun calamari - Seemed like it was re-heated in an oven as the tops were burned. Calamari should be fried and served immediately.             Proscuitto arugula - Tasted great. They didn't pre-slice the pizza, I was expecting the pizza to be pre-sliced.             Cannaloni - Came with 3 rolls, tasted great.   Cons - Management has not responded to the bad reviews on Yelp.             They seem to be busy with their takeout service.             We asked for water and didn't give us any water glasses, we just drank the water from the wine glasses lol! When a customer asks for water, the server should offer the proper glassware.              An owner or manager or someone should really address these concerns, they have closed their Thornhill and the  Boutique location already.   Protip - The entrance is on Blue Jays Way, the address on Yelp is incorrect. Will try and update this.    Damage - $51 before tip."}
{"text":"@pizzarustica It's one of the few restaurants, close to the heart of the entertainment district which you can make a reservation at, and inexpensive but good food.   The pizzas were actually quite good. Thin crust, crunchy - with lots of different toppings like smokedn salmon/sour cream, spicy sausage, pineapple and pancetta. They also have the option for a gluten free crust! (I did not see a note on the menu for an extra charge, but I think they charged us $3 for this). It was crunchy and tastey, and no different from the regular crust.  Each pizza was $14 - 16 each. If you're really hungry you could have a whole pizza to yourself, but I think best to share.   They were able to accomodate our big group, the servers were friendly enough, and willing to do group billing. They also had a really good wine list, serving by the glass, 1/2 litre and full bottles.   What I hated was the decor. It felt like a grade school cafeteria with wooden chairs, and plan tables. Everything was the same colour, and the place itself was small. What's also worse was the single stall bathroom, either I felt guilty for taking a long time, or I had to hurry up becuase three other people were waiting behind me.  I'd totally come here for the pizza, but take out - I wouldn't wanto to stay."}
{"text":"Good wine Meh... On the pizza. But I'm a Brooklyn snob.   Service was so so. Only went as a last resort because there wasn't much else around the Renaissance hotel late at night."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on a Saturday night through just eat... we ordered at 7:00 and the expected delivery time was 8:00. At 8:30 when the food hadn't arrived I called them to ask when I could expect the food to be delivered and the woman on the phone told me I had only placed my order at 8:30... I advised her that it WAS 8:30 and I had placed my order an hour and a half ago and she said \"Oh.. well it must be out for delivery than... listen if it doesn't arrive in 15 minutes you can call me back\". We had ordered bruschetta (which in fairness I have ordered from them before and it was great) and it showed  up with garlic bread as the bread to put the tomato on... my boyfriend had ordered a panini... but he got pasta?The pasta I had ordered was correct and tasted okay, but the dessert we had ordered they were out of and didnt bother to tell us.. also the food was cold :( too bad as I had ordered from them once before and had a much better experience."}
{"text":"Never again. This place gave me food poisoning!! I got the Italian sausage and mushrooms on a pizza then I was sick for the next two days!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, its the best pizza in town.  I've been going to RUstica for about 7 years now and think its hands down better than other fancier pizza joints that are double the price.  I'd recommend the Fragola salad and Sausage&Calabrese pizza."}
{"text":"I had to update my review to reflect such a disappointing lunch. My friends and I got there around noon on the first day of the work week. I ordered the roasted vegetable panini. Well they were out of bread for the panini so I said I was fine with a substitute and I asked whether it would be a flatbread instead and it was confirmed. What I actually got was something resembling Wonder Bread. And it was barely warm. More like room temperature. I doubt that it touched the grill for more than a second. There was absolutely no trace of any grill marks. The bread was so soft when I touched it I left indentations. And inside was a couple leaves of spring mix, a scattering of goat cheese, zucchini slice and a raw tomato slice. All that for $13!  I could have made it at home for pennies. What kind of Italian restaurant runs out of bread at noon? One of my friends had the penne. It was chewy. $15 for chewy pasta.  You've lost 3 customers."}
{"text":"I move away for two years and everything falls apart. I've lived in the building for 10 years and Rustica under its previous management was great. I just got back and it's a disaster. Poor service (urg...filthy bathrooms)...and the menu is uninspired. So disappointed and sad that the previous managers are no longer there."}
{"text":"ok guys, its wed's night, and I still cant believe how bad my food was on sunday evening at this \"restaurant\"...arghhhhhhhhhhh   WTF."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre: the calamari was good but the pizza itself was not thin crust, no whole wheat option and the service was horrible with no follow up on the food or not letting us know the food will be late.  A pizza and a calamari dish took close to 30 mins to arrive.  The waiter requires more training."}
{"text":"Conveniently located near to the Second City theatre performance. For a group of three, we split the Bruschetta Rustica, Cajun Calamari, and the Pollo Pesto Pizza, which were more than enough. We thought the cajun calamari would be unique given the seasoning and it was great paired with the two types of sauces provided. The pollo pesto pizza was a good call! It came on a thin crust and had the right allocation of mushrooms, mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, and chicken. So delicious! The restaurant was able to accommodate us in a timely manner and had us full and ready to leave right on time for our show."}
{"text":"We got the pizza 50% off from justeat, but I would say it wasn't even worth the lower price. The beef smelled on the pizza because it wasn't seasoned. None of the pizzas were really seasoned. The pizza kind of falls apart, not sure if it was cooked properly. The prosciutto is really salty and the cut is too thick, and it was just kinda thrown on the pizza. Overall not good at all, and the regular price is RIDICULOUS, I would be pissed if I paid $16-18 for this tiny, sub par effort."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Around 17 dollars a plate but the pizzas are filling and if you wanted to, you could get one for two people. That being said myself and three others got four and ate them all."}
{"text":"Where to start!  I've had one amazing experience with them and one... INTERESTING experience.  I placed my most recent order via just-eat.ca in advance, for it to be delivered at 6:45pm.  At 4:45- I get a call.  They're at my condo (I'm at work) and i said.  He grumbled slightly and said they'd have to make it again.  5:30pm rolls around. Get another call.  They're at my condo again. (I'm still at work). He grumbled slightly and said they'd have to make it again.  6:45 rolls around.  Nothing. I call the restaurant after a few minutes to make sure there wasn't something weird going on- and our buzzer rings while I'm on the phone.  He's here!  Head down.  Order isn't complete.  A whole pizza is missing.  He told me I only ordered two pizzas (incorrect) until he actually looked at the receipt.  He then proceeded to indirectly blame me for the the fact that three poor drivers have had to bear the blistering cold to bring me my pizzas and that the restaurant doesn't even look at the time on the receipt- just what's being ordered.  I didn't understand how that was my problem and I refused to a) be spoken to like that and b) pay for an incomplete order.  I told him to take it back to the restaurant because I didn't want it anymore.  I went back to my apartment and called the restaurant and explained what happen, and the nice lady put the owner on for me to speak with.  I told him what had gone on and even though I really didn't want the pizza anymore, he said he'd deliver it to me himself and pretty much offered me anything extra I wanted- I told him he could surprise me with a dessert.  Well he did.  He brought the pizzas, 4 desserts and some calamari (holy crap) to me personally and apologized for the mix-up.  I felt horrible for him for having to deal with this, but was very thankful to receive such great, personal service.  It shows how much pride he really takes in his restaurant and that says a lot.  The food was incredible- I'm actually in physical pain from eating so much of it so fast- it was that good.  I will order from them again in the future (if they'll let me) but will probably never order in advance again as that seems to be where the main issue was.    Thank you!"}
{"text":"Walked passed here randomly Friday afternoon, the high winds were picking up due to rainy weather so whatever restaurant was next, I was going to eat there.  Haven't been to Italian in while, it has more of an Italian bistro feel then restaurant. Bunch of small round tables everywhere, red, gold and black decor. Kind of dark yellow lighting but I like darkness so it was fine by me. Service and food was great. I wish we were hungrier then we actually were because the 12\" pizzas looked delish, lots of interesting varieties, Pear Pizza, I will be seeing you next time. We got a salad,  it was one of the best salads ever. The green was dark, cranberries added a zing, pear was refreshing and the sweet toasted pecans gave the crunch along with the salad, we ordered the calamari. The calamari was good, nothing special."}
{"text":"I started going here around 2009 and all the food was great, but the pizza was amazing.    Flash forward to now.  I was dreadfully disappointed with everything I ordered. The pizza crust was uneven so it was soggy in some spots and burnt in others. The toppings hardly seemed fresh and overall was just bad.  The pasta we ordered was bland and felt like it was out of a can.  However it was cooked to a perfect al dente.    The waitress was awful but I cut her some slack and made a joke about her being new to serving.  She laughed and said she had been there for months.    I hope this once great place can get its feet again.  But I'm sure they will succeed even if it doesn't get any better.  The majority of its patrons are blue Jays fans on the way to a game."}
{"text":"In the heart of Downtown Toronto, on Blue Jays Way, this modern sit down Pizza joint is sure to make you feel like your at authentic Italian Eatery!  Pizza Rustica is a modern flair to your typical local pizza shop. Modern deco design shapes the kidney shaped room, and an open aired pizza oven sits in the centre of the room where the chefs show of their inspiring Pizza creations. There are many different types of Pizza to choose from - Goat Cheese with Spinach and Hungarian Salami, traditional Margaritra, and the to die for Portobello mushroom, sausage and parma. Try one of the inspiring, yet light hearted salads to start, or perhaps a tasty pasta dish as an entree. Pizza Rustica provides guests with traditional food, at a reasonable price. The location allows you to eat quickly, and catch the Leafs or Jays within a short walking distance. Pizza Rustica is also open late, which means after a night out dancing, there is a great place to get your late night fix of the munchies! They also deliver across the street to the SoHo Metropolitan Hotel. If your staying as a guest, be sure to call for a great alternative meal in your room!"}
{"text":"I'd be giving this place 4 or 5 stars if it wasn't for disappointing service. We went on a Friday, before a Blue Jays game. We had a small group of 4 and admittedly showed up just under 15 minutes late for our reservation which is why I was even willing to overlook the amount of time it took before we had menus in hand and then the further amount of time before having drinks ordered from the time of us sitting down.  I even have to say that the appetizer of grilled vegetables and goats cheese was a very impressive and 5 star quality appetizer. But then we waited. And waited. And as every group in the restaurant that arrived after us and received their food before us, my disappointment grew. Maybe they thought we were actually there for a slow social dinner, and everyone else vocalized their going to the Jays game which is why they received preferential treatment. I don't know.... All I know is that it took us 2 hours between the time of being seated and actually receiving our bill. The pizzas finally came out (again, being served last of anyone remaining in the restaurant) and while they were admittedly quite good, I can't help but feel a little insulted and disappointed that we had to arrive to an event 1/3 of the way before it ends when others made it through without hassle.  4 stars for food, 2 stars for service. 3 stars for Rustica."}
{"text":"Good food, poor service. Were passing by and decided to walk in, host who sat us was very welcoming and personable. Waitress was the opposite, could not answer our questions regarding the menu and answered her cellphone while serving."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have had great experiences. Also, I find this place is just enough off the beaten path when there are major events going on at the ACC or a baseball game at Rogers Centre. The pizzas here are pretty great and always arrive fresh and hot to the table. The food took a bit of time to come, but it was always worth it. Most recently I got the pear gorgonzola pizza which was awesome! I would not have imagined eating a pizza with pears on it but the fruit gave a lovely sweet and salty flavour with the cheese, and they used a cream sauce instead of tomato on it. Very filling."}
{"text":"We came here with two teambuy coupons so it was definitely worth it! We ordered:  Cajun calamari $11 Caesar Salad $7 Bbq chicken pizza $14 Rustica pizza $14 Seafood Linguine $17  The appetizers were both really good, the salad was shared among 4 of us and definitely sauced well, no runny water on the bottom of the plate! Cajun calamari was crispy and offered a different take on the norm,  The bbq chicken had too much sauce but was still good, the rustica tasted better but the toppings were falling off, not enough cheese on neither! The pasta was really good, seafood was fresh and pesto added a lot of taste, and was not salty like other cream pastas!  Decor is nice and could be good for groups and dates, both types was there, casual and nicely dressed!   Wine list isn't anything to write home about, washroom was single stall and the boys didn't flush :s  The waitress was really nice and not fake which is always a plus! But she did put oinions on my pizza after I asked for none but then they did replace it right away while some places will try to make it look like your fault! Some poor guy got a parking ticket across the street while we were dining! Over all its nice if I'm in the area but I'll stick to Hot House Cafe for my pizza/Italian :)"}
{"text":"I'm glad we went to redeem my voucher. Though it should have been at Stori Speritivo restaurant where the voucher should be. Food tastes good, staffs are nice! Price with the voucher is great!!!"}
{"text":"Canned mushrooms. There is no excuse for using canned mushrooms on a simple pepperoni/mushroom/green pepper pizza. If you've run out of fresh mushrooms, take it off the menu until you get more. Green peppers and pepperoni were also half-cooked.  My dinner partners enjoyed their pizzas, however, and I've had OK (but just OK) meals here previously.  It's very close to the Rogers Centre, which may explain much about the lack of attention to detail. They should take at least half of the crazy topping combinations off the menu and re-focus on doing the basic ones properly."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last week with a friend.  I had purchased a teamBuy certificat ($19 for $45 worth of food).    It was a Wed night and we arrived at about 6pm.  We were seated quickly and our drinks were brought to us almost immediately after we ordered.  We shared the mussels appetizer and it was delicious.  The portion size was really good for an appetizer.  For our mains I ordered chicken penne and my friend had the seafood linguine.  The portion sizes, again, were good.    Service was fast throughout the meal.  The decor here is a little dated, but that didn't take away from the meal at all.    Good value for the money, even if we hadn't used the teamBuy certificate.  Dinner for 2 people with drinks was around $60, which is quite reasonable for this touristy neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I didn't have high hopes for this place, but was pleasantly surprised. It may be yet another restaurant buried in a condo high-rise, and the name of the place may be uninspired, but it's cute inside and the sausage calabrese pizza is some of the best I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"BEST PASTA I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE  I believe it was a seafood linguini but it was so creamy and flavourful with just the right texture and absolutely mouth watering, I have been begging my boyfriend to go back with me ever since.  Outstanding ambiance and service as well!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  My server was great, probably one of the nicest servers I've had in ages.  The place was pretty empty at lunch when I went so I guess it wasn't too hard to be nice to her only customer but still...  The atmosphere was nice, it's a 1 minute walk from the skydome, and the pizza was very good.  I had the Rustica and ate every last bite!"}
{"text":"NASTIEST PIZZA IVE EVER HAD! my boyfriend and I came home super late from Canada day and decided to get pizza. This was around 2am. They gave us a running total of around $35 with drinks. When we protested that was high, they brought it down to $29. Food comes and the driver asked For a tip. My boyfriend doesn't believe in tipping and is offended. Pizza comes back up the stairs to me , we open it and the cheese is half melted (Can see the actual cheese shreds) , and the dough is half cooked. PISSED BEYOND BELIEF. Wasted $30 on some nasty pizza. Don't come here   UPDATE: OWNER CONTACTED ME CUSSING AT ME AND TELLING ME TO DELETE MY COMMENT/REVIEW. I will be reporting this business to the Better Business Bureau and the health department for undercooked foods"}
{"text":"Not the greatest place to go.   Not many highlights from my experience here. Our food took forever to come out. I wanna say over an hour. When we finally got our food, it was decent. Had the jambalaya fettuccine. At first the waiter gave me the wrong dish, was really confused because I was sure I didn't order a white sauce pasta. Eventually, the waiter got it right and got me the right dish.   I'd say the only positive (aside from the leafs winning that night) was the efforts displayed from the waiters. They did definitely try they're best to provide a nice dinning experience.   Don't think I would visit again."}
{"text":"Because I'm staying at a hotel nearby, I ordered from here...4 times. I am an idiot, clearly.  The food is just plain bad. It's an absolute disgrace that they charge $17.00 for a pizza that is worth $1.70.  I have dined in, had delivery and done pick up. The pizza has little to no flavour, little no toppings...I ordered a Calabrese Salami and Sausage pizza yesterday for pick up. Some slices had one piece of salami on it, some had one piece of sausage. I have also had the Three Meat Pizza...how having 3 different types of meat creates a bland, tasteless pizza is beyond me! Seriously, no flavour.  I also had a Caesar Salad. This is Romaine lettuce with industrial bottled dressing. You can get this same dressing at Costco. It's not homemade and quite horrible.  It was chaos when I showed up to pick it up. There were 3 people with their pizza sitting in boxes desperately trying to pay so they could leave. A girl working at the cash register who also has to search for peoples' pizza orders muttered to another girl also searching for orders, \"I'm so ready to quit this job.\"  I understand. Their management is atrocious. These girls can only do what they do with what they are given.  You know you're in for a bad experience when an Italian restaurant has TRIAMISU on the wall, not TIRAMISU. Really,TRIA- misu.  But bad spelling is the least of anyone's concerns.  Terrible food. Terrible service. I don't know how they stay in business. And it wouldn't take much to create quality food."}
{"text":"Very very mediocre for downtown from the food to service, although the takeout/delivery counter looked busy.    Pizza seemed to be prepped in advance and not heated up thoroughly, the aioli sauce for dipping calamari was straight up Helmans  mayo, Nutella pizza is a great idea but it was so dry and impossible to cut or chew.  Maybe we just got in on an off night who knows...  I had to wave frantically to get server's attention- had to ask for water, cutlery.  Through the main course no one came up to ask how is everything or to take away/ask for refill on an empty wine glass.  Though no one likes hovering waiters, but this is the opposite extreme.  It took forever to pay as well.  The ventilation is very poor, once I left I realized i stank of combination of garlic, Nutella and tomatoes from head to toe ... My clothes are in the wash as we speak!  I would maybe recommend to try this place for take out, but for a more pleasant dine in experience and quality pizza, take your business one block north to King street - Il Fornello or Cibo for example."}
{"text":"Ordered a \"Large Pizza\" with \"garlic dip\" for delivery.  Received a 6 slice thin as printer paper pizza with pesto in a cup. Called to ask about it and received the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Clearly the staff does not care about their customers, or the reputation of their \"company\". 15/10 would not recommend to anyone, even as a last resort (which it literally was)"}
{"text":"Really friendly service, awesome soups and salads, all good. Really liked the vibe on the inside too, not loud and dingy"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money, go anywhere else. Food is ok but the ordeal that their customer service is really makes the whole thing not worth your while. I ordered from here, they didn't have what I ordered and made a replacement without asking me what replacement I wanted. When I asked them to address it, I was told to email the manager.  Food was delivered very late and cold. The driver called me to get me to spell out my address even though I had inserted it twice during the ordering process.  Their \"tiramisu\" is some hybrid of a chocolate cake with some pudding thing on top -definitely not tiramisu, and they definitely changed the recipe because I had had tiramisu there in the past and it was reasonable. When I contacted management, I was given a rude and dismissive answer and no responsibility was taken for the situation.  Over the last three years, I ordered from this place a lot, and it used to be great, but something happened in the recent months that has turned into a terrible option. We spent a lot of money ordering from here but there's no sense that our custom or feedback was welcome, on the contrary, so I will never order from here or go to their restaurant again."}
{"text":"Joined some friends for a bday dinner before going out.  I liked the pizza.  Not the greatest I've had, but it was good.  I had the sausage (Salsiccia) pizza and they used real chopped up sausage.  I would repeat.   Cheers..."}
{"text":"Love love love!  Love thin crust pizzas ~ have been here twice, once I had something with pineapple (yummy), and the other time I ordered seafood pizza (mostly because I haven't seen it on a menu at too many places).  I liked the seafood pizza, but my friend didn't like it...she ordered the rustica pizza (but her's was covered with no less than 4 slices of proscuitto ~ so mine would be bland in comparison).  Anyways, the service is good here, and the food is tasty.  I like the \"peach champagne\" - it's prosecco with peach juice or something.  Yumm!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst food I have ever received. My first time ordering was awful, but i decided to give them another chance. My food arrived cold, the calamari was undercooked and the pizza was soggy and looked worse than if it came out of a delisio box. To add insult to injury, the marghereta Pizza we ordered came with a 2×6mm piece of black basil dead center. Do not order, don't even consider it."}
{"text":"This place just doesn't do it for me. I've been a few times and it just doesn't do it. Although the decor is nice and service is decent the pizzas are just sad. They aren't anything special, sure they are better than Pizza Pizza but that's not a hard task. I've been here a few times and just was disappointed every time.  I find the pizza crust to be more of a pita consistency than a pizza crust, the sauce was lifeless and skimpy, and the cheese tastes like it's from a package. I'm not saying the pizza is bad but when you name yourself Pizza Rustica, you should make rustic pizzas. I want fresh mozzarella chesse, a dough that's thin and cripsy but light and fluffy in the middle, and a sauce that blends everything together well. Maybe they were better back in 2004 when they were voted Toronto's best pizza but recently it just has missed the mark.  The decor is nice with lots of red, funky angled chairs, and light fixtures shaped like peppers. The service was friendly but nothing really stands out as outstanding.  Maybe I'm setting my bar too high but this pizza and I are done. Still a good place for a meal but I don't think it deserves all the pizza hype its getting but that's just me.  Overall, the decor and service was good. The prices are reasonable for what you are getting... just avoid the pizza. Kinda defeats the purpose of a pizza place doesn't it? Here's hoping that enough beer will fix it!"}
{"text":"We came here for late night pizza after checking out Second City and we were happy with our pizza experience.   We got the Chicken Portobello and it was very good!  I wouldn't plan a romantic dinner here as the atmosphere is a little cold and the service very basic but the pizza was very good and light and hit the spot."}
{"text":"Needed a place for a large group in the area and Pizza Rustica fit the bill. They allowed us to do separate bills which was a huge plus. Also one of the few restaurants in the area that is open on Sunday afternoons. The food was delicious. I particularly liked the salmone pizza, the spaghetti and meatballs, and the Cajun chicken. I wasn't that fond of the philly steak pizza but others seemed to like it. Will definitely come back, especially if I have a large group."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for a quick bite to eat. Good atmosphere, small, quaint w/ reasonable prices. Obviously you don't come to Toronto, or Canada period, for pizza...but it's still pretty good. Their pizzas are served on a thin crust. I had the chicken & (BEEF) sausage pizza that had a little spice to it, and included tomato and cream sauce, mozzarella, and arugula. Great flavor and good service. Sooo, not Italy, but still decent pizza."}
{"text":"Despite the business suffering from being surrounded by construction work, we were suprised by how quickly we were rushed out. Mains arrived before we were even half way through the appetiser. Cajun chicken pasta was neither cajun or chicken - you had to search to find any. Instead it was a bowl full of watery sauce and dry pasta. the pizza was slightly better but fell short on toppings.  With so much competition around  why would you go back a second time."}
{"text":"My husband and I had walked past this place a few times during our stay in Toronto. The smell had us salivating every time! We had lunch here on a Saturday. We were seated immediately (since we were the only people there) by a very friendly waitress. The place had just opened so it was nice and quiet and service was super quick. We skipped appetizers and went straight for the pizza. I had the Tre Carne which was great! The meats were very flavorful and banana peppers were nice and spicy. Very delicious! My husband asked if he could have a pizza that wasn't on the menu, it wasn't a problem at all. They obliged his request. Price was VERY reasonable for the area. The pizzas were about 12 inches each, more than enough to satisfy. My husband and I had a pretty big appetite and I polished off about half and my husband about 3 quarters. We had enough to take back to our hotel and have a whole other meal. I definitely suggest this place for a quick cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Downtown pasta and resto bar offers a polished ambience and good food at fair prices, and the service is always pretty good. It doesn't stand out in the way of being extremely unique, but it's a good place to go to if you desire good Italian food and a place to have a drink before the game at the SkyDome without breaking the budget or having to fight crowds."}
{"text":"I ended up eating here twice during my last visit to Toronto. The first night I had brushetta and then the Cajun chicken pasta dish. Both were fantastic. The Cajun chicken pasta dish had just enough of the Louisiana spice to heat up the mouth to a tingly level. The service was great too! Second night - a group of us shared pizzas - which were also very good and comfort to the tummy.   I would recommend both locations around the corner from each other ."}
{"text":"This place was a cross the street from where i was visiting in Toronto. Never thought you could mess up pizza. It was horrible. I should have taken the advice from other yelpers i just didn't feel like walking futher"}
{"text":"I literally NEVER in my life have written reviews but this place deserves this......The food is bland beyond belief, like it's a joke how bad the food is. The owner (guy with beard) is a complete idiot! I witnessed how he was treating the uber delivery guys and I was absolutely disgusted. He brought an overall uncomfortable and unpleasant vibe to us as guests! Never going to return."}
{"text":"Listen, first I'm going to say that I don't mind \"bad\" pizza. I work on King Street and have a fine array of choices of sub par pizza places, and I still go to them normally. Today a buddy said \"Hey we haven't tried this yet, let's go\". I went for the classic. A Margherita. Dough, Tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil. The simplest pizza anyone could want.  I swear to you, you're better off with delissio. I am positive this is the worst pizza available in the city. I'm not saying this to have a funny review or anything of this sort. The owners of this restaurant seem to be employing every cost cutting strategy they can. First off, the tomato sauce was thick. Extremely thick. It was half an inch of tomato sauce on the pizza but it actually retained its shape. You could put a finger in it and that spot would stay clear. It tasted like canned tomatoes and nothing else. Not D.O.P.. Not Italian. Just no name brand tomato sauce.  The mozzarella was entirely flavorless and not melted at all. It's as if they just tossed pre-sliced old mozzarella from the freezer on top. They were solid pieces too so each time you took a bite, the whole cylinder of cheese came off in one go. Not in a nice gooey way, but the whole piece just came off like I was biting into a raw block of mozzarella.  Then, the basil on top was shredded and brown.  I don't know what's going on here. Don't fool yourself with this place. You're steps away from Libretto and even Masseria (which is a pizza nova ffs) which are much much better. This is clearly a place meant to hose tourists in the area for a game.  I'm giving it two stars because my buddy liked it though. But, he's a 905er, so I think he just believes anything in the entertainment district is good."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say except that it was just OK.  I was a little disappointed because I had read/ heard so many good things about this place.    I went there for lunch with three of my colleagues; we split two Rustica Salads and two Frutti Di Mare pizzas.  The salad was mostly mixed greens with just a few little olives in it and not much dressing and the pizza didn't have huge flavours like I would have expected.  They were kind of lean on the fish (and cheese) but the fish was fresh.  Again, just OK.  To be honest, the pasta dishes looked a lot more appealing.  The couple at the next table had ordered the Seafood Linguine and the Meatball Spaghetti and both looked delicious; they finished every last bite.  Service was great though; waitress was super friendly.  I will definitely go back and try something other than the pizza."}
{"text":"I travelled here but it's 24 hours. They've got a \"create your own pasta\" choice which I go ham with. I personally like the pasta that I make and the taste of the sauce and how they put it together and the portion they serve. They also have cocktails and wine. I stay at the Marriott and find this place convenient and 24 hours on Uber eats for good quality food over other half ass restaurants. Idk why this restaurant only has 2.5 stars honestly."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Pizza tastes like cardboard. Delivery is always cold and they never send the drinks that are paid for. There is NO CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"Yes... Unclear on the concept of thin crust pizza comes to mind when reading the few of the other reviewers. Perhaps the other reviewers have never had an opportunity to enjoy a New York style thin crust za.  Beautifully executed in a 12 inch size, the signature style of the pizza will impress you. Great spaghetti and meatballs (made with fresh basil & veal) is a steal.  Authentic Italian Wedding soup is classically prepared and deee-licious. The patio is still open and available as the last hoorah of summer slips  by. Oh,Illly Coffee served. Nuf'said.."}
{"text":"Second time here. Was here last week while in town as well. Great hours! Food is great. Although I had the same thing twice (Chicken Supreme Panini ), others I've been with have had pasta dishes. Everyone enjoyed theirs too. Portions are good. I couldn't finish the panini either time. Doug is the best server ever."}
{"text":"I am writing this review on both the Stori page and the Pizza Rustica page because from my understanding Pizza Rustica apparently took over Stori last week (on King St East). If that is not the case I will happly delete this review from this yelp site.   This was the worst dining experience I have ever had, bar none. It was so bad that we went to McDonalds after to settle our stomachs. Below is a summary of the quality of service and food so that people are aware.  (1) Service We attended this place on Saturday April 7, 2018 for the birthday of one of our friends. Our friend made a reservation for 20 people, given the size of the restaurant you would think they would have prepared accordingly. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The restaurant had apparently lost my friend's reservation and overbooked. To make amends they offered to set an impromptu \"prix fix\" menu for the group at $20/person. That seemed like a great deal, and so we sat down for what would become the most unusual dinning experience I have had.  The first thing we did when we sat down was go to the bar and order drinks. The restaurant was empty, and it took us 5-6 minutes to get someone to take our drink order. My friend ordered his girlfriend a Moscow Mule. What he got was not that, it was most likely a vodka soda but who knows. I ordered my wife a gin and tonic. My wife's response to that drink was: this tastes like nail polish removal.   Subsequently, the restaurant apparently ran out of wine. So that's fun.  (2) The Food  What to say here? Well, the food was abhorrent at best. The restaurant was either not equipped to serve the food it was making or was making food on the fly without having any knowledge as to how to properly prepare that food.   Appetizers: fried calamari, salmon tartar, salad.  The fried calamari was anemic or anorexic. I'm not sure what the appropriate term would be. Where you normally expect a calamari ring that is roughly at least half a centimeter in width, these were strings of calmari rings that were overly fried and delivered without a dipping sauce to speak of.  The salmon tartar. What is salmon tartar? Well, by the standards of this restaurant that would be raw salmon with a ton of salt sprinkled on it on a bed consisting of nothing more than a thin slice of tomato. This was less tartar than a quick way to raise a person's blood pressure and give them food poisoning. I had one bite and had a full glass of tepid water to clean out the taste of salt and stale fish.  Main: Pizza, Risotto and Lasagna   The pizza was either burnt, overly topped with blue cheese, or was a margarita pizza covered with barbecue sauce.   When the waitress brought out the \"lasagna\" it was what could best be described as a plate of schlop masquerading as a lasagna. In fact, when asked what it was the waitress said, \"It's lasagna...I think\". That is a strong vote of confidence from your own staff. To paint a better picture: it was basically a bunch of lasagna pasta in bolognese sauce with mozzarella cheese on it. It had no shape at all and it was insufficiently salted.   The Risotto was...well it looked like vomit, I refused to try it for the sake of my own health.  Dessert: This was the only saving grace (I gave it a star for this alone). I think it was red velvet cake from a store or the Metro down the street. Whatever it was, it didn't suck.  Coffee? We asked, the waitress said they ran out of coffee... I guess the espresso machine was just for show.  Will we ever return? Certainly not."}
{"text":"We had catering ordered into our office, and the meat lasagna from this place was incredible. Best lasagna I've ever had. Sad to see that it's not offered on the restaurant menu, whhhyyyyyyy?  Note: this was catering, rating is based on quality of food, not the restaurant or service.  Edit: turns out it is available on the menu. YAY"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza! We came here on the later side on a Friday evening, and the place was mildy buzzing (not too full but not empty either) and split two pizzas and some sangria. The servers were great, especially with their recommendations. They have a pretty large selection of pizzas so it took a bit to figure out what we wanted.  These pizzas are big enough to split between two people, but the right size so that if you were hungry or ambitious enough, you could definitely eat one yourself. The sausage and calabrese was pretty solid, with spicy sausage really giving the pizza a nice kick, and the tre carne was pretty flavorful too! The cheese was particularly good, and the sauce had a nice, tangy flavor to it. The pizzas were thin and kind of floppy - this is the kind you fold in half and eat like a taco.   Pretty solid pizza - definitely gets more crowded as the night goes on. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place is an amazing pizzeria if you like your pizza to taste the same as the cardboard box it comes in! The scuz ball manager was trying to pawn off a 3 day old pizza for a discounted price witch was very generous.  All in all of you want to go to the flea market of pizzerias this is the place to be !"}
{"text":"People with allergies should beware. We tried to order gluten free pasta for our daughter, and they said they could not guarantee there would not be cross contamination. Why offer it, then? She's also allergic to peanuts, and they said they use the same utensils to measure everything out. If you are truly celiac, you probably want to avoid eating here."}
{"text":"I went to have dinner with a friend tonight.   The decor is somewhat average with TV screens showing sports everywhere, even on the patio. The tables are a bit cramped together, expect to hear your table neighbors well.   They do have a good selection in the menu with a lot of Gluten free options. The prices are fair.   To start, I had the Italian Wedding soup (4/5). Nice big bowl of pastina pasta, beef and dill .I then had the Rustic BBQ chicken salad (4/5). Good portion, tasty with the peppers, coriander and tortilla bites.   My friend opted for a Pear & Gorgonzola salad topped with a chicken breast. (2/5). He really like his salad at first, but the more he dig,the more black lettuce leaves he found. Weren't really impressed. The waitress was nice enough to give a discount on the salad.   Speaking of waitress, ours was very friendly and sweet, but the service was really slow. I think they were low staff and  it took forever to place our order and get served. The place was not full either.   There's a lot of good options around this area, I hope they will try to improve consistency in food and service."}
{"text":"I didn't want to eat nachos and hotdogs with nasty (but probably tasty) artificial cheese before the Jay's game so I opted for Pizza Rustica.  Their small pizza sans-outer crust was the perfect size for me.  I got the chicken, spinach with cream sauce.  It had a bit of sun-dried tomatoes and although I'm not a huge sun-dried tomato fan I thought that a little bit of it added a nice touch.  The thin crust was just perfect and had a slight hint of a smokey oven flavour.  I was a little disappointed that they ran out of duck and were not making their soup of the day, the two things that I originally wanted to order.  Their patio was beautiful, albeit noisy on this perfectly sunny day.  It was a true Toronto experience with loud trucks honking and traffic right beside the patio."}
{"text":"Team lunch, we had reservation for 25 ppl. They still didn't schedule an extra server. The owner just walks around and talks on the phone. Food is decent..if you order sandwich, seems like you will be the last one to get it."}
{"text":"I love their pizzas. They have good quality toppings and their crusts are thin. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very chill and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"GREAT food!  Stylish little boutique that seats maybe 10 people.  They do takeout.  This is real restaurant food, not fast food, so you pay for it.  But if you want quality in a pinch (I get takeout for dinner at work nearby) it's very nice to have so near.  The pizzas are superb, if a bit light on ingredients.  Try their salmon salad.  It's greens, with a huge portion of smoked Norwegian lox on top...very nearly a meal in itself. The calamari is great, with 2 great dips.  The pastas are also excellent.  I've never been to the main restaurant around the corner, but I imagine it's the same (but bigger)."}
{"text":"Seems as though the food is better when dinning in but for the most part I've always been happy with them. I'm not a big fan of the pizza places in Toronto but this one I will eat."}
{"text":"Desperately craving pizza, but not of the Pizza Pizza variety, I headed to Pizza Rustica for the first time on the recommendation of a friend who had walked by it many times, never been, but ensured me it always smelt \"very, very good\".  We arrived at about 7:30 on a Friday night, and I was surprised at how very small this place is. There are about 10 - 15 tables and a bar area, and unfortunately we got there just as the last table was snapped up. Luckily there were 2 spots left at the bar, and we were able to get a drink while we waited. A nice surprise occured when our would-be waitress approached us and asked if we'd like to order before we got our table, as the food would arrive as soon as we were seated. Nice one. My stomach at this point was practically jumping out of my throat, so speed was key.  Once seated (about a 20 minute wait at the bar), our food arrived approximately 5 minutes later. I ordered the Tre Carne pizza, with a ton o' meat and banana peppers, onions and tomatoes. The ground beef was fantastic, really flavourful. The pizza itself had a nice thin crust and a thin but balanced layer of sauce and cheese. I personally am not a fan of thick crust or too much sauce - less is more, so this suit me perfectly.  All in all my pizza craving was asauged, and the leftovers (and unless you are ready to eat a small horse, there will be leftovers) tasted even better warmed and with a little hot sauce the next day. The place itself is a little small, so if there are no bar seats I'd move along, as the wait isn't worth it if you're standing around for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"First, fruit fly on my date's wine and we were indoors. Not even sure if they replaced it. Not worth the groupon.   Second, appetizers took over 15 minutes. That is not up to my standards or anyone else's.   Third, management and servers made me feel so uncomfortable. Management accused me of using the wrong groupon despite the fact that I paid for it and my name isn't Lindsay. Waitress barged in on me while I was in the rest room. I'm guessing she had her sexuality confused. She was also laughing with the other staff members. They even teased my date and told her to lock the door.   Lastly, wine was way too strong and dessert was not editable. She only took two sips of the wine which she's normally a huge fan of wine and immediately complained. Dessert tasted like cardboard and they didn't have her favourite dessert on the menu.  Overall they deserve a negative 5 stars."}
{"text":"Absolute TRASH!!!  The owner and staff of this restaurant should be ashamed of themselves but based on my food delivery tonight and the horrible reviews on this website apparently neither have the pride nor the self respect to do better. I made the mistake of ordering from this restaurant and then checking out the reviews afterwards. Well I have to say that my fellow Yelpers were more than correct. The pizza took over an hour to arrive and it is thoroughly inedible. The abject abomination of the concept of pizza. This restaurant needs to close and give it up as there's nothing redeemable about the food that arrived tonight.   At Pizza Rustica, it is either complete and utter incompetence or outright malice towards those that like their food to be enjoyable. I'm now surprised there are no reviews on here of people getting sick or dying. Probably won't be long though. Pizza Douchebagica is far more like it."}
{"text":"Nice waitress who took our to-go order, food was done in 10 minutes. She was very friendly and offered us water while we waited.   The food itself? Underwhelming and on the bad side where I didn't feel up to finishing everything.   Penne vodka -- saucy, while not watery or runny, it was also not creamy. A little spice, the tang of tomato, but a strong parmesan flavor. And prosciutto on top, which I had never seen on this dish before.   Margherita pizza - Thinner crust, but not paper thin either. Way too much parmesan cheese on this. I was expecting more mozzarella cheese, some basil and fresh tomatoes. I only saw sauce and cheese. And the parmesan taste was overpowering. I let my husband finish the remainder.   Bruschetta - this was the best thing and fresh. Enjoy it the most because it had the least amount of parmesan cheese flavor, as it was only sprinkled on top. A large portion, and there were plenty of bread slices. Bread was warmed, but not necessarily toasted, and the type of bread might have been a soft loaf rather than a baguette or a sturdier bread. So it didn't hold the tomatoes as well as it could have.  Held me over until my next meal, but would not go back. Only a big draw since close to the Soho Metropolitan and open 24 hours."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery even though my friend lives next door but I was pleasantly surprised to see that condo dwellers get a 15% discount before taxes!  And the owner delivered it himself just as we were about to call to ask where our order was ;)  The salad I ordered was a decent size and the flavors were decent. The portion of smoked salmon was not too much and not too little. However I was left feeling hungry afterwards. I like how they always put the dressing on the side!   I would only order from here again if visiting the same friend, just because it is convenient."}
{"text":"Fresh and simple food.  Best pizza I have had in 4 months. Staff is really friends and cares about quality.  Nothing trendy here. Just a great product served by great people."}
{"text":"Stayed at the ritz while in Toronto wanted some pizza found this place on yelp..what a BIG mistake ..the place was empty we ordered one cheese pizza and one pepperoni pizza it took over 45 mins and the restaurant was empty so I couldn't understand why the long wait..when the pizza finally came the cheese pizza was burnt SUPER BURNT..as the waitress bought out 3 plates for my party of 7..she said she was going to back to get more she came back with NAPKINS and explained they didn't have any more plates...????? She wanted us to eat off the plates..the waitress didn't apologize and offered no other alternative we asked for the check and asked that she remove one pizza and the wine that we had not drank as we where leaving ..we got our bill and left..please avoid this place at all cost ..."}
{"text":"Just AMAZING!!! Great Italian restaurant.  The pizza is outstanding.  The best in the city!!!i this is the first place I walked in when I came in Toronto on 2009 I am still their client since that time .. Well done"}
{"text":"We used to frequent this place quite a lot. Went there after a year or so and seems management has changed. The pizza was not bad, but neither was it spectacular. The worst was that bottled beer was not priced on the menu but was shocked to pay $8.50 for a bottle of Heineken. Overall i would say not great value for money. There are better options around."}
{"text":"Great Italian wedding soup for her (still full from lunch) and decent pizza for him."}
{"text":"The restaurant is not clean and they don't respect their customers and visitors at all. The owner is rude with the customers. The food is poor too. I will not visit them back again"}
{"text":"Great place to go before the Jays game.  I came here two years ago with my Aunt, and the other day with my cousin.  The food is really wonderful, but on this most recent visit, the service was truly lacking.  The waitress was extremely apologetic, but it was ridiculous how unprepared this place was for the inevitable rush before the ballgame."}
{"text":"Great pizza, didn't know what to expect going in but couldn't be tastier.  Great service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch last weekend with some friends, let's just say both the service and food could have been a lot better.   To begin with, we didn't even get menus until we requested them ...   After that, the owner went on to bash Wahlburgers across the street complaining that they take away all of his business and that their food is crap, etc. Well sorry to break it to you buddy, but instead of blaming other restaurants on your lack of customers, maybe you should look around and see what you can improve upon!   Here are my suggestions:  -Provide free bread to each table, it's a small gesture that goes a long way, and is the norm in Italian restaurants  -Don't bash other restaurants in front of customers, it's extremely unprofessional!  -Focus on more quality dishes and a less extensive menu, the menu was huge and I was not impressed with how much I paid for such a small serving of cannelloni  -Customers should be acknowledged right away, there's no reason it should've taken so long for us to even see the menu   Hopefully you see this and take it to heart. I had previously heard great things about this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Usually I love this place but this time the serer was grumpy, my pizza was burnt and my friend's pizza had the wrong toppings. Super disappointing!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent Italian option on the west side of downtown TO. The location on Blue Jays Way in the Entertainment District is in a favorable spot. The storefront is bright and inviting and the interior is nicely done providing a pleasant atmosphere in which to enjoy a relaxing meal. Being open 24 hours is also a nice feature for those arriving late into town, as I did on the occasion I visited.  I walked in at about 10 PM and there were only a couple of other people in the place. I was seated right away and my server attended to me immediately. She did a good job looking after me while I was there. The menu offered several Italian favorites with a smattering of creativity. I opted for the Fettuccini Jambalaya which was a lovely concoction of Andouille sausage, chicken and shrimp in a marinara sauce over fettuccini. I thought it was rather tasty.  My bill was $39 CAD with my entree, a large bottle of sparkling water, tax and tip. This was a little on the high side but not necessarily out of line. It was a decent value and I was happy in general. The hotel at which I usually stay when I come to town is just down the road from this place so I will likely visit again."}
{"text":"Live across the street, come here often. Food is always excellent, service is usually good but sometimes could be better.  Love the spicey pizza they have"}
{"text":"Decent pizza in Condo-land.   I'm surprised to hear people comparing it to places like Terroni. It's good - but it's no Terroni!   Pizza Rustica serves thin crust pizzas (your choice of whole wheat or normal white pizza crust) but I feel like they are missing a little TLC. They are good but just good, I would never compare them to anything I ate in Italy! Ingredients just do not seem really fresh. Pizza is tasty but nothing to fantasize about.  That being said, the price is right ($12-$14 for most pizzas). Cheap for this neighbourhood.   I also tried the Italian Wedding soup which was pretty meh...it could have been Campbells, for all I know.   The decor tries but kind of fails, reminds me of something from the 1990s despite being a newer restaurant.  The service was very, very good. Friendly, attentive and quick.  Decent choice if you are in the area but don't travel here for the pizza. Go to Terroni or Libretto for that."}
{"text":"After I placed my order I got a call fifteen minutes later to tell me they didn't have the whole wheat crust. Received my order 1h 20m after ordering (I do not live far)  Received my pizza and it was missing the avocado (main reason I ordered that particular one). Both pizzas I ordered had vegan cheese and they barely had any on it.  Paid 40$ for two tiny pizzas with SPARCE toppings and that was AFTER a 20% discount . This place is not worth the money or time waiting. Do not order."}
{"text":"Terrible service, bad 'vegan' salad dressing, and it took forever to get our pizza. We had to ask to get more water and the sausage didn't look cooked. The waitresses said they questioned it as well.... Not a good time!"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch with 10 colleagues. It was Family Day in Toronto, and this was the only thing that was open for our party.   I've been to pizza rustica before, and while the pizzas are generally pretty tasty (with gluten-free crust options) this time was a bit of a loser. Not only did it take an hour before the watiress even took our orders, the food came out at different times, two orders were wrong (one dangerously as it had to do with an allergy), my margherita pizza was burned, and it took us almost 2 hours to get out of there. So much for a business lunch on Family Day.   Many of my co-workers enjoyed their pizzas, but not the wait time or the mistakes.   I will probably go again in the future, but not when I am in any kind of rush, or with anyone with sensitivities or allergies."}
{"text":"Ordered a prosciutto and salami panini via Ubereats this afternoon. When the driver handed me a box that was larger than expected, I was stoked to devour a massive sammy. I proceeded to open the box and unwrap a 2 inch thick focaccia. Unfortunately inside the panini there was the thinnest sliver of prosciutto and salami, with only one slice in each half of the sandwich. There was also supposed to be goat cheese  inside  but there was basically just one tiny crumble per side. What a joke, I basically ordered a piece of bread for $15. I had a bite of the bread, it was so dry and threw it in the trash. Luckily Ubereats refunded me for this poor excuse of a panini. Judging by the majority of negative reviews here, this joint seems to serve crap food with bush league service. Would definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"A lot of the yelp reviews shit on this place, but I had a good experience. I showed up on a friday night before a show at Second City (around the corner). It was busy and there were few tables; I was a party of 1. They seated me right away and took my order, were friendly, and I am not kidding you, served me in 5-7 minutes. I could not believe they cooked my pizza so fast. I had the pizza rustica and it came with goat cheese, sundried tomato, mozzarella, sauce and prosciutto. I held the mushrooms. The pie was delicious fresh and warmed up nicely a few days later. This place is great."}
{"text":"DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS RESTAURANT.   The food was average and the service was an embarrassment to the restaurant industry.   Our server could not have cared less.  Let's see.  Where to start?   **She did not know what vodka the restaurant served.   **One in our party requested an unsweetened iced tea.  The only tea they serve is sweetened.  Person ordered water instead.  Iced tea was brought to the table. **There did not appear to be someone working to bus tables.  Our server was busy doing God-knows-what and we did not receive a single additional pour of water throughout our meal.  Our glasses sat empty while appetizers were finished and throughout our entire dinner.   **Three people in group ordered starters.  Only two came to the table.  Waited for our server to return for over 10 minutes while she talked on the phone and to another group that had entered the restaurant after we did.  Finally asked the other server for our cup of soup.  She said she would take care of it and it still was not delivered to the table before our entrees came (delivered by second server).  Again, it was a CUP OF SOUP.  I know how that's prepared - ladle it in to the bowl.  HOW LONG DOES THIS TAKE?  ** Even after dealing with the person on the phone and this other group, our server never returned to our table until we were done with our entrees.  She never apologized or cared to explain her absence from our table for over 20 minutes during dinner service nor the forgotten cup of soup.  When she came to the table, she did not notice our empty water glasses nor offer anyone another drink. ** Our entrees were ready and sitting on the window from the semi-open kitchen for several minutes and our server never even looked in their general direction.   **  Caesar Salad did not have Parmesan cheese as description claimed it would. DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS RESTAURANT.  It is thoughtless and not hospitable."}
{"text":"Owner is terrible. Do not recommend supporting this place.  Pizza and pasta were subpar. Can get much better food elsewhere with better management."}
{"text":"Note to anyone with allergies - don't bother walking in the door. The server told us they have a \"30-inch prep surface\" and \"one cutting board\" that they use for mains, salads, desserts etc.  so they won't bother trying to avoid cross-contaminating allergens. She told us to leave because a member of the group had a nut allergy, saying that she \"wouldn't eat here\"."}
{"text":"Update - emailed them after I wrote the review. Responded within ten minutes. Apparently had a weekend promotion by justeat that resulted in 100 orders and only 5 drivers. He apologized and said they were overwhelmed and offered to make it right. Given the brutal weather and these circumstances, and the attempt to make it right, I updated from 2 stars to 4. Have ordered from here in the past without issues from Just eat. Will give them another shot.  --------------------------  Waited 2.5 hours after ordering and they just never showed :( The food ordering website called and called, but no one answered. They even left a message with the owner. I got a credit, but waiting until 12:30AM for food you ordered at 10PM is ridiculous, especially when they don't come at all. They still are showing up on uber eats saying arrive in 30 minutes. Avoid, avoid, avoid."}
{"text":"Along with Terroni and Pizza Libretto, Pizza Rustico completes my triad of \"favourite pizza places\" in Toronto. I have always had great service and an enjoyable time there. They have a decent selection of pizza topping combinations as well as many pastas. Service is decent and friendly but the food wait can be long and daunting.  Good place to go on the way to a Jays/Raptors/Leafs game as it's close to the Air Canada Centre and Skydome!"}
{"text":"Ordered off of foodora.   The pizza would have been alright if it was hot. Mine was cold. I also ordered a juice and they sent me the wrong one."}
{"text":"A little underwhelming. This place is SO close to our apartment and was highly recommended to us by a coworker... we had such high hopes.   I ordered the rustica pizza (signature pizza) and my date ordered the pollo alfredo pizza.  The ingredients and sauces were all good and fresh, but the crust left us feeling a bit sad.  It was thin and almost had a sweet taste to it (?) and was also orange in color... Not sure if I can accurately pinpoint the problem, but it definitely was not worth the hype.  Saving graces: sangria (YUM) and dessert (warm brownie, YUM)."}
{"text":"Delicious. Whether you get the meat or the veggie, the thin crust is handmade and fresh. The taste lingers long after the meal. Expect to pay 14-19 bucks for a medium sized, 6 slices pizza."}
{"text":"This is not a joke review - this place had the best value breakfast I have found in the city - a pizza place. I prefer spending a little more eating at Senses or Le Select Bistro - $20 each, but at Rustico you get a better value fill for $10. And I dont want to speak of the low quality of Cora's again. Cora's is passable but I cannot cook that average a quality meal in my own home.   So, Rustico, I got their special - it had bacon, eggs, home fries and toast; pancakes and fruit. Coffee as well. And I was pleased with the service and the food, mostly. The food was all great quality and big portions, except for the fruit - too much of it, given that it was half spoiled.   Anyway, I just had to write this one because I was stunned to find a great place for breakfast right outside my place - and that it was in a pizza place. It's great. Try it out and let me know if it is consistently good. Thanks.  Addendum: This venue no longer serves breakfast during the week."}
