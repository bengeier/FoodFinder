{"text":"Came to Jared's for the first time. I got the a hot dog, a cheese burger and fries. Let me tell you the food was just as great as the service if not better. Can't say enough about this place other then trying it for yourself. 100% all USA beef burgers and dogs. I highly recommend this place if your down on the Vegas strip, and the prices are affordable. Five thumbs up"}
{"text":"The lady taking the orders was super friendly and helpful about other sites we plan to see while we are here!  Food was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great establishment. A true hero works here. Witnessed an employee detain a robber. This man deserves a raise or a vacation. The food was also very good."}
{"text":"Delicious cheeseburger. Ordered some tots also. So good. Great people watching.  Service is happy to have you as a customer."}
{"text":"This place wasn't perfect, but was pretty close! We decided to go to the pawn shop where Pawn Star's was filmed we star this place close to the shop and being a burger connoisseur we decided to stop. 

The Good-

The prices were right. The menu catered to burger and hotdog lovers. They knew what they did good and stuck to it. The patty and cheese were good. The tater tots where golden and crispy. The portion you get on tots was outlandish. We could have fed a family of 5 with the order, same goes with the onion rings. The bacon appeared to be made at the time of order for my friends burger. The buns were quality. 

The Bad-  The gentleman that took my order didn't make my cheeseburger plain. My bun was hard on one side. 

Suggestions- They need to serve Heinz ketchup instead of off brand and offer season salt and vingar for the fries/tots. Also their pickles could be better. 

Over all though it was good and definitely worth giving a try!"}
{"text":"When we were in Vegas last we were 'jonesing' for a class 'A' burger. We found it ! Juicy ? Yes ,Tasty ? Yes !, Expensive ? NO !! And it is next to the famous 'Pawn Stars Shop'."}
{"text":"Love this place. Second time in a week I've been there!  The hot dogs are perfect. Good snap and flavor. The chili is one of the best I've ever had which is saying a lot. Fresh sauerkraut can't be beat and the burger was ideal and made to order.  For a great price point on the strip where you feel filled up this place cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"I came to Jared's around 12 pm on a Sunday afternoon and I just wanted a nice burger and tater tots but something happened that I will never forget. A woman was robbed right in front of our table. The robber had a knife and ran off with her purse. We started running after him, but the real hero was an employee from Jared's. He ran after the burglar and caught him hiding. He ended up getting the purse back and saved that woman's day. 

Anyway, food was delicious. You get a good selection of toppings for free on your burger and fries/tots. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"My absolute new favorite place to get food. Burgers are out of this world, everything was made fresh to order. I got a classic burger with 13 toppings on it & ALL MY 13 toppings were FREE!!! (Only paid $4.99) 
Best corn dog I ever had, the batter is addicting, got Jareds Everything I ordered was fresh and delicious, if I could I would give this place 10 stars!! Great food, great prices, great atmosphere! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"So this review is based on a togo order, however plans are in order to have a fresh taste. First off the freshness and prices are incredible. The onion rings are definitely worthed. The thickness of the rings and the taste with a cool crunch and the same on the fries. Now lets talk about the in house sauces. The ranch was incredible but that mustard is a omg! The burger and corndog was tasted and reported. The burger was on point and the grilled onions was incredible. The buns wasn't still toasted and the corndogs as well which is what has inspired the trip of freshness. Thats the only reason the 4 came in to play other than that they would have had a 5 all day. I will say the atmosphere, the team, and prices are on point and absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Unbelievable that this place had all 5 star reviews. Overpriced garbage. For a single cheeseburger with bacon and disgusting french fries and  canned soda for $12. The burger was a bland McDonald's like patty with no flavor. The french fries were soggy and terrible tasting. Only positive was the bun everything else was uneventful and I have a hard time believing any of the previous reviews are real. We have way too many good burger joints in town for this place to even be in the discussion Inn and Out burger is even better than this place and i'm not a big fan of theirs either. The only thing I can think of is people are excited to be at the Pawn Stars pawn shop because you have to have no taste buds whatsoever to think this place is something special."}
{"text":"Stopped by a few weeks ago. I ordered the Hamburger vs the Hotdog only because I'm not an overall fan of Hotdogs. I was surprisingly happy with the taste of the Jareds Hamburger. I'm very picky when it comes to burgers and sushi. Service was great, even with it being very busy and got my order faster than expected. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has the best chili dogs, hamburgers and onion rings in Vegas! Don't miss this one. Located next to Gold and Silver Pawn Shop"}
{"text":"I planned on going to Ricks BBQ but the prices were outrageous.  I saw Jared's and went into check it out.  I was greeted by a very friendly and smiley young lady named Olivia. She went over the menu with me in detail as I had not been there before.   She was very engaging and her guest service was outstanding.  The cook in the back assisted her in going over the menu and they had a great sense of teamwork.  My order was ready quickly and accurately and packaged nicely.  Olivia thanked me and invited me back to let her know how my  first experience was.  The food was AWESOME! It was hot,  fresh,  DELICIOUS and very inexpensive! We have been back twice since and have had the same fantastic service and food. The prices are great, the food quality is excellent and the service from Olivia and the team is stellar! its our new favorite burger place! I want to keep this place my own little secret but with such great service and food I am sure it will become a hot spot soon!"}
{"text":"Had to stop by for lunch today as I am a local and would like to see this plaza and it's tenants successful as a whole for downtown LV. Well lunch was \"AMAZING\" ordered the bacon double cheeseburger, fries, and Dr.Pepper  all of the ingredients are very high quality and cooked to order. I saw some chili cheese tater tots going out as well that looked bomb! I will try then next time. It is a beautiful day out so I dined al fresco with about 12 tables to choose from as you seat yourself. Lunch costs me about $14 which is fine for the high quality of the ingredients used. Both of the owners stopped by to touch my table which is a plus for customer service as well. Locals go check it out!"}
{"text":"It's amazing that it's hard to find a decent hotdog in the downtown area, now you can. Jared's is new and in the pawn plaza on Las Vegas Blvd just north of Charleston. My hotdog and my friends' hamburger were both excellent. I got my order to-go but there are tables outside. They also have Slingshot 3 wheelers for rent. 
Most important to me the staff is friendly and professional."}
{"text":"I've stopped by for lunch twice and both times food was delicious and super fresh!! The service was great as well, very friendly and attentive staff. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fresh never frozen - yummy in my tummy.
Gotta stop by & try .....jared's sauce is bad ass."}
{"text":"Just had a great hot dog and tater tots with chili. Awesome! Even better the folks working there were so great an accommodating. Thanks Jareds!"}
{"text":"Food is delish, Defintely worth the price. I paid  5 dollars for a small chili cheese fries! Omgosh it was a large in my.eyes i had to take my left overs home. It was so big, and so yummy. I love how the fries are crispy and the chili just feels your soul. Not to mention they have awesome customer service at that! True winners in my books."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Pawn Plaza!
Jared's is more than reasonably priced and very simple.
Burgers/dogs/fries/tots/rings!!
Lots of free toppings to chose from and a couple of toppings you can buy.
Service is fast and friendly and the food is good!y only suggestion....add coleslaw to the menu....this country girl living in Vegas loves her a good ole chili slaw dog!!"}
{"text":"Jared's Old Fashioned Hamburgers & Hot dogs....good food at reasonable prices...build your own burger or dog with the huge variety of free add ons...however if you want cheese, bacon or kraut....those are extra...but still not bad. Also tried the \"tot-choes\"...tatertots smothered in chili and cheese, which you can add grilled mushrooms and onions if you like for free...they were very good, and its a large portuon, enough to feed 2-3 for a side dish.  Next time we come to vegas from cali, we will for sure stop by Jared's again."}
{"text":"Found this burger place in yelp with good ratings on April 29, so I headed out there to order my food to-go and the reviews were right.  I loved the burgers and hotdogs chose your toppings from a long lists- but I was not too crazy about the fries- maybe because I had it in the bag for about 15 minutes.  Service was okay- I ordered 2 burgers and two hotdogs, but only the two burgers got in.  Hotdogs placed in order and waited a few extra minutes then I was good to go.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick bite before work.
Very friendly, clean and professional staff, greeted me as I walked in the door.
The nice young lady that took my order explained everything to me i detail and made some very good suggestions.
I love that when you order a hot dog or burger the toppings were included and not \"pay per topping.\"
The order was taken by tablet, and I signed and had the opportunity to choose to leave gratuity  on the screen, signed with my finger and was waiting for my food in seconds.
The food came out hot and delicious, exactly how I ordered it.
In short, I had a great experience and will definitely eat here again!
Thank you Jared's you deserve the \"famous\" in your name!"}
{"text":"The last two times I have been by Jared's, both within posted business hours, the place has been closed. What gives? Is my favorite burger joint gone for good? I'll be so bummed..."}
{"text":"Great place to come and eat especially if you're coming down to see Rick's Pawn Shop...Burgers were made fresh and the fries, onion rings and tater tots were all delicious!!!"}
{"text":"All the food is amazing! From the hotdogs and hamburgers (which you can customize) to the tots and fries. Literally everything is great. Fast service, friendly staff, fun environment. A great experience all around. Highly recommend checking them out!!"}
{"text":"Just all around good experience! Fun staff, delicious burgers. Love how you can customize the burgers. It's reminiscent of Five Guys but even better!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & service!!! Came here on a whim with my husband and sons ages 3 & 8. Sat outside and ate on an overcast good weather day in Vegas. talked to the owner, Jared, who was chillin outside and he asked how my food which I replied \"amazing!\" He was cool and it was good to hear the owners still really care about their customers experience. Prices are great & everyone that worked there was super friendly. The girl at the register was helpful by telling us how big things were (tots order is huge!) and the corn dog is one big one cut into 3 so perfect for sharing. Jared sauce was delish! I will definitely come here every time I'm in Vegas! Great location off the strip, outdoor seating & family friendly. Highly recommend checking it out for good eats not too far off the strip. 

Also, while we were there it we noticed a pawn shop in the same parking lot and lots of people outside of it waiting in line and running around with their cameras out like paparazzi! We then realized we were next to the pawn stars reality show shop. So the area was busy but a little busier than usual because the girl that worked there told us one of the stars of the show was right behind us. Had no idea, I don't watch it. So if you have plans to go to that pawn shop for a visit or try and catch that guy Chumlee then you should eat at this place while you are there!"}
{"text":"Near Downtown Vegas, next door to the Famous Pawn Shop, highly recommend to stop and get your grub here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Incredible service, great prices, and killer hot dogs and hamburgers!  Everything is so fresh and I love getting to pick any toppings I want with no additional cost.  Great new addition to downtown!"}
{"text":"Saw they could make some veggie stuff so I tried it. Not great. The veggie burger is a patty made of tater tots. It was pretty good but a little messy.  The bun was good and the toppings were fresh. I also got onion rings which were good but maybe a little well done. 

My biggest problem was the service. When I walked in the two employees were eating at the register. That's very odd to me. And they left their half eaten food there the whole time I was ordering.  They both seemed nice but they took forever to make the food. Considering just about everything there comes off a grill or out of a fryer, I was surprised at how long it all took.  There is also no place to wait inside which is a big deal when it's 115 outside. 

Overall the food was not great but just ok. The service was lacking. I prob won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Delicious burger. Had bacon and cheese + all toppings. juicy, tasty.  Great bun. Smokin' burger."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a snack. It's good for what it is...greasy junk food. Service was ok, again not overly impressed."}
{"text":"Let's be completely honest for a second. I love hotdogs and anyplace that is specifically catered to hotdogs or things of that nature I will probably want to go to and will probably like. I mean, I love a good hotdog. We came here to just get a quick bite before we headed out to do other things. There is seating outside that is covered so it has a nice little zippy in and out feel to it but seating so you can enjoy your meal. 

The people at the counter we really friendly and had nice things to say. I was actually surprised when they asked if I wanted a steamed dog or a grilled one. I of course asked for a grilled one. The toppings were plentiful, even for a condiment queen like myself. I thought it was really nice joint.

The hotdogs took a bit to cook since they were from the grill but once I got mine it went down fast. It was more like a foot long dog than a regular dog, or at least I think so. I thought it tasted fantastic and was a perfect little snack. 

I would suggest this place as a nice little stopping off point for people!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Jared's Old Fashioned Burgers for the first time today. It was a great experience. Not only was the burger, tatter tots and Jared's sauce amazing...the service was outstanding. The girl Olivia that took our order was so nice and sweet. She went out of her way to bring our food upstairs to the balcony so we didn't have to keep running up and down the stairs with my daughter and my grandchildren. The owner was also extremely nice and professional. He was very friendly and made sure we were happy and satisfied with them and our food. Overall the whole place was an incredible experience! My family and I will definitely be back many times!"}
{"text":"Recently ate at Jared's and hands down the yummiest spot for hot dogs and burgers! They were extremely fresh and had a lot of flavor. For me, best hot dog bun I have ever had. And you must get their tator tots! I dream about them, they were THAT good. And I can't forget about the staff, super cool people that made you feel like you were family! Try Jared's the next time you want a GREAT hot dog or burger- you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Jared's burgers and dogs are great.  This place is a hidden gem, and well worth the trip downtown.  They have tons of topping, all of which are free to add to your burger, dog, fries and onion rings.  The price is right, too.  Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Francisco and decided to give this place a try. Great burgers and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Shout out to jareds for hooking up their vegan clients with the best damn $5 in town. We just were gonna order the fried which are bomb and crispy... Then the manager offered to make us veggie patty burger with all th3 toppings excluding the mayo based stuff. Regarless this burger was piled high super high with tots grilled mushrooms onoins the whole 9. I would highly recommend any veggie or vegan to give jareds a shot just ask for a veggie patty cus its not on the menu ... Shout out to the cook and manager thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Best Hot Dog and Burger joint in town. Super cute set up.  I'm obsessed with the burgers!  Today I found out they have Tator Tots!  And you can order them with toppings. I ordered chili cheese Tator Tots!  #yum"}
