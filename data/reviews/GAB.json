{"text":"Probably the best place to work in Montreal. Located on St Laurent in the Mile End neighborhood, this is one of those places that make me want to permanently move to Mile End.  There is an espresso bar upon entrance and a really sweet barista hosting it. I ordered a cappuccino which was $3.25 (everything else is also $3.25). The cappuccino was as perfect as it could get, balanced beans and skilful steaming. You could tell that the barista tamped the espresso beans evenly before putting the portafilter in the machine because it reflected in the silky taste of the coffee. They serve in cute, black vintage cups and you can pay on your way out. They also have few options of sandwiches which I didn't try.  On a small corner, you have space for coffee shop guests and by small I mean a couch and three stools. The rest is shareable workspace that you can rent. You can rent workspace here for $1.30/hr + tax or you can buy a chunk of hours valid for one year. The desks are huge and clean. The interior is spacious and well lit for working and they provide high speed internet too. The place is mostly very quite with few exceptional chats between customers, no music even. It's the right level of noise for me. They have huge windows on the front that allow natural light to get in and have a loyalty system where you get a cuppa coffee free after 7 cups.   I will definitely come here more often to get my productivity up and might even buy few hours. Loved this place, has a lot of potential to become my favourite spot soon."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!! This place is an epic fail. You know you've lost the game, GAB, when your politics and clubhouse \"rules\" preclude basic humanity. My partner and I stopped in here to grab a coffee on a very frosty -12 winter afternoon, and when we tried to sit down with our just-purchased coffees to warm up, we were promptly and rudely ushered out of the café, and told we couldn't sit down for a moment inside because that privilege is for \"members only\". What kind of elitist nonsense is that, when we were clearly freezing and the ENTIRE café was empty?! Spread the word: you have to have first earned an a*****e badge to enjoy your coffee here, after they've happily taken your money."}
{"text":"Cute cafe to grab a coffee to sit & people watch.  Stopped in after grabbing some Fairmont bagels and doing a little shopping.  We were in search of some wifi and GAB was perfect for quenching our thirsts and resting our feet :)  Pretty spacious inside with plenty of space to set up your laptop and grab a drink & snack.  They didn't have any chilled bottled waters but the service was good.   This place is located on a busy part of Saint Laurent and there were many patrons but did not feel crowded.  I really liked this place!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to work! It's a co-working space / cafe. The internet is extremely fast (about 30 MB/s, that's 240 Mbits/s). The benches are set up for work with ample room for each person to have laptop, snack/drink, and a book or something all at once. The outlets are easily accessible with two outlets available per person.  You are welcome to bring your own food and drink to this space and they have a refrigerator for clients. There is a fee to be in the space, which can be paid by the hour, day, or month."}
{"text":"Très intéressant comme concept. Un espace collaboratif payé à l'heure pour travailler, avec café fait sur place. Super sympathique le service, qui nous expliquent avec joie comment fonctionne leur petite place.   Même leur nom de réseau et leur mot de passe wifi est marrant :)   Peut être bruyant part moments mais il y a une petite salle au fond pour s'isoler au besoin."}
{"text":"Great co-working space with plenty of seats and tables with outlet. The staff is super nice and you can help yourself with water from the fridge.  For about $6 you can work for 7 hours and $12 for the day. You are free to go out and come back to work again or you're allowed to bring outside food while working. How awesome is that?"}
