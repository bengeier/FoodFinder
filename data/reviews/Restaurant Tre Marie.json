{"text":"I had the veal in white wine sauce with a side of pesghetti in red sauce. I know a lot of people have reservations about eating veal, and how the practice in which they're raised is inhumane and whatnot - I understand, I respect that, but I don't care. I believe animals were meant to be eaten, if not, someone please explain to me why are they so tasty? It would be inhumane if they farmers flooded the barns with Celine Dion's greatest hits album through loud speakers and made the cow wear a party hat - THAT I will not stand for... no offence to Celine as she is a frequent customer to this place - you keep doing your thang girlfriend.   The highlight of this plate was the veal itself - obviously. Tender slices of milk-fed veal smothered in white wine sauce, the aroma coming off this plate made my nose drool. Meaty and bovine in taste, the veal was swimming in this sweet sauce that I would have been more than happy to drink as a soup; which says a lot considering, I don't like soup! The pasta as always was perfectly al dente and tossed with the homemade tomato sauce."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident.  Loved it. Had traditional dishes and not so traditional.  Quaint but homey feeling.  Excellent food."}
{"text":"The food here is great! Everything is so fresh and the staff are very friendly. If feels like Italy. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"An available parking space in front of the restaurant dictated our choice of Tre Marie for dinner. We didn't even check Yelp. Sometimes you just have to go for it.   Chicken Parm was really good. Just the right amount of sauce, cheese and chicken. Nice and crispy. Our waiter Rahat was fun and the place was quiet and calm so it was nice to linger.  A good mellow dinner experience, on a nice quiet weekday evening started off our Montreal trip very nicely."}
{"text":"After trying to find a spot for my family, we stumbled upon this casual trattoria. The ambience was 'homey' and quaint. The food was delicious, simple, and consistently good amount all dishes ordered. We had the lasagna which was good and the rigotoni with meatballs. A little sauce-y, but good."}
{"text":"Wow! Not only the staff were amazing and really helpful(the poor guy went through the whole menu with me cuz i don't speak a word french) but the food was just delicious.. They even have a pasta trio for undeceive people like me to get to try all sauces. If you're looking for homemade style Italian cuisine this is the place to go to"}
{"text":"Outstanding.  The dishes here are uniformly good.  I've eaten here twice. This is an authentic and very tasteful Italian restaurant in the dwindling (becoming more multi-ethnic, that is) Little Italy neighborhood of Montreal.  It is run by Italians who know their craft and is not a trendy eatery run by those blending California-Italian cuisine or some other newfangled spin on Italian.  This has evidently been a Montreal institution for decades.  I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Food tasted not so well. Salad was plain. Asked for parm cheese and I did not get any. Pasta tasted plain like out of a grocery store. I wish I ate at home. A frozen meal would have been better."}
{"text":"There isn't much of a selection of restaurants in little italy. This place isn't too far from marche Jon talon so we stopped in. It's a cute little place with a friendly wait staff. The menu isn't extensive but the pasta is fresh and tasty and their tomato sauce isn't bad."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Italian resto in Montr√©al. Every time I visit I'm left feeling so good with what I chose off the menu. All of their pastas are wonderful, especially their tagliatellle egg noodle pasta with meat sauce. Just amazing. I recently tried their tomato with buffalo mozzarella starter (by recommendation of the server) and loved it. Their house wine was perfect with my dish. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic pasta. Delicious. Service amazing.  Our first visit in Montreal. Would definitely come back if in town again. Raviolis were amazing."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give a big fucking zero for this restaurant.  I went there with my girlfriend on a saturday night hoping for a good italian rustic meal since I heard a lot about this restaurant and read a lot of awesome review.  So first of all the bread was dry, the butter was tempered but served in cafeteria plastic cup (I mean seriously?!?!). We received our starter pretty fast (that's prolly the only good thing I noticed), I had the minestrom soup witch was under seasoned, more like a potato soup with overcooked veggies and a pinch of parsley to decorate in the middle so welcome back in the 90s. My gf had the mixed salad witch was soaked in the dressing..there was like a puddle of dressing in the bottom of the bowl at the end when she was done eating it.  Then we received our main course (we both ordered the parmigiana veal with tomato sauce spaghetti on the side). Spaghetti was well cooked but not fresh (YES! NOT FRESH MADE PASTA IN A TRUE ITALIAN RESTAURANT), the tomate sauce was soo acid that it needed another 2 hours of cooking minimum. It tasted like a soup can or the bottom of a dishwasher water..it's like there was no garlic, no basil and needed more olive oil to make it more silky since it was a bit granny. The parmigiana veal was not freshly made because the crumb was soggy, the veal was tough and overcooked...well a Michelina's at 2.39$ at the grocery store would be more satisfied than that. Then the server asked us if we wanted cheese on our pasta so we said yes. He bring some fucking already shredded parmesan witch was kraft parmesan or something like that. There is no way it was grana padano or regiano because it tasted like shit.  Service was totaly absent, we had to fill our wine glasses ourselves and they never came to ask us if everything was fine.   Seriously , this restaurant is a big fucking joke and if Rosina was in the kitchen that night then I'm sorry sweetheart but it's time retire.    I will never come back and you should avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"Want to know what family run trattoria in Italy is like? Go to Tre Marie on Clark ,don't  look out the windows and you are in Italy.Went there last night and was amazed. The food was outstanding,the staff warm and friendly. Just a great place."}
{"text":"Hoping to kickstart labour, we headed here for a lasagna feast. I'd always admired the tidy, traditional building exterior, and I was curious to experience the interior of Tre Marie. We found it to be brighter and more pleasant than many traditional Italian restaurants. The service was very warm, and the food was delicious-- and served in generous portions. When the waitstaff heard about our goal of inducing labour, they plied us with their homemade hot sauce. In the end, something worked: Our baby arrived two days later. We'll definitely celebrate future events with lasagna at Tre Marie!"}
{"text":"A delightful meal. We had the Pasta trio (a nice mixture of 3 different kinds of pasta), chicken Parmesan, and cappuccinos. Everything was fresh and quite tasty. The restaurant is very comfortable, and the service was great. Highly recommended, would definitely return."}
{"text":"Tastes like really good home cooking. The pasta is cooked just right, the cheese was tasty, osso bucco cooked perfect."}
{"text":"This place is the old school neighborhood Italian restaurant you've been looking for... Everything was wonderful; the friendly service, the great food, the reasonable prices. I had the three pasta sampler, my daughter the fusilli with rose sauce, my wife the gnocchi. Just delicious!! Go and enjoy!"}
