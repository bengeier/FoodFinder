{"text":"This is my second time here, the 1st being a few years ago, and I don't know why it took me so long to return because the food was ssooo good.  By a recommendation from someone else's review I read on here, I got the mutton biyaani which was amazing. I also got the chetinnad chicken, which I didn't love because there were only 3 pieces in it and 2 of the bigger pieces we mostly none, not worth the $12! Got a popular mutton dish, but don't remember the name, it was the 1st one on the mutton list. Also got garlic butter naan which was so buttery and delicious. I'm stuffed!  The service was also quickly and friendly.  Was in and out within an hour on a Sunday evening.  Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Too few south indian options on the menu for a south Indian restaurant.. N the sambhar was tasteless..more like tasteless daal.. No south indian masalaas or veges in sambhar..n d idlis were anything but round and soft.. Won't return..!!"}
{"text":"if you are here for the buffet, it is only on the weekday mornings  except for Tuesday.   Food is awesome. If you appreciate south indian food then this is a place that you must try. Generally speaking, this particular line of cuisine is famous for using indian spices with a special focus on herb based ingredients.   The servers were fast and courteous. You'll probably have a nice experience here.   I took out one star from the review, because of their timing does not agree with me as I preferred weekend and evening eating out."}
{"text":"The food here is good but the service is extremely bad. I found a white plastic-like piece of something in my dosa which I spent about good five minutes experimenting with my guest to see whether it was harmful or not. While I concluded that it was most probably ok to finish eating the food and that what I found is something that is not non-veg (as i'm a vegetarian!), I was still disturbed by the experience. Consequently, I called the waitress and informed about it. She took the white plastic-like object from me and had a discussion with the mangers and owner right in front of me (everyone made eye contact and/or starred at me while having a discussion, lol!). Waitress came back and said that I could have gotten another dosa but since I finished eating what I ordered i'm no longer eligible AND  that it won't be taken off the bill bc they are already doing their anniversary promotion and so they cannot offer another discount. I was really upset because a) this whole thing interrupted my dinner, b) interrupted my dinner date with my guest, c) caused a lot of stress d) wasted a whole lot of my time, e) and to make matters worse they offered me a deal which apparently had expired because I continued to eat the dosa - this is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard from a restaurant manager!! and I was extremely shocked to hear it come from a restaurant that charges a hefty price!  I went straight to the owner, David, and brought up the issue. He repeated just what the waitress had told me which is that since I finished the food, they cannot offer me anything. I told him how much i'm disappointed and upset by their customer service. I raised all of the above points as well as the fact that all complaints should be handled directly by the manager and the least that could've been done is give an apology instead of arguing with the customer with a ridiculous point!! What was evident from the conversation is that the managers and especially the owner have no customer service skills and they have no interest in looking after customer satisfaction. David was simply using a cookie-cutter approach to the problem instead of looking at it in an individual basis and focusing on customer satisfaction. He said that his team of staff figured out that the white plastic-like object was in fact a piece of flattened dry rice. What they failed to do is inform that to me so that at least it would have put me at ease instead leaving me to feel that i could've potentially eaten something harmful. What was really interesting in the conversation with David is that no where in our conversation he took the ownership for their mistake which includes but not limited to: a) sending a waitress to address complaint instead of  a manger, b) not informing that the object is in fact rice and not something harmful, c) not offering apology, d) offering a deal that apparently expired because i finished eating the last bit of dosa i had in my plate, e) telling me that because they were doing a promotion for their anniversary, they cannot offer another discount for me (which was a very foolish thing to say!).. etc.   If they want business, they need to start looking after their customers!!! This is a very shocking and disturbing experience esp since this came directly from the owner! I promoted their anniversary deal by forwarding their email to friends and colleagues - I will surely be informing all of them of this experience. at least at the end of my complaint, he should've offered a statement of apology or something to make up for the stress and disturbance caused but instead he was all about wining the argument.  There's a lot for David and his management staff to learn re: customer service! Perhaps go dine at Fabbrica or Joey or auberge du pommier or even cheaper restaurants like pickle barrel to really learn what customer service is all about!"}
{"text":"Good:  Naan, Paratha.   Average:  Mutton Sukka Masala Poor:  Muttar Paneer, Chicken Biryani  Way over priced for quality of food you get.. I have had some authentic Biryanis, this one did not even get close to tasty, was spicy, but rice itself was not even well made.  Sad butter chicken.. Mutter paneer.. was a serious Meh.. these are standards and should have been made very well but were not.. on bright side, they made amazing  Naan, and Paratha, too bad couldnt enjoy it with same caliber for other dishes I got.  Place was really busy.. now i don't understand why.."}
{"text":"Our first visit here and We order this paper masala dosa which was sooooo unexpected..haha it was huge.The taste was okay! I order mango lassi too but wasnt that good...smthg was missing..Overall, the service and food was good not excellent!!"}
{"text":"Chicken biryani was like rice mixed with turmeric, salt and boiled chicken. Don't bother ordering kadhai chicken. Mysore masala dosa was alright. Have had much better chicken lollypop."}
{"text":"Authentic Chettinad food!   Chettinad, is a region of southern Tamil Nadu state in India, which is world famous for its culinary delicacies. The food is essentially spicy, with the usual full meal (thali) consisting of cooked dhal, eggplant (brinjal) curry, drumstick sambar (\"kara kolambu\" is a highly regarded south Indian sambar), ghee for flavouring rice, and sweet dishes like payasam. You can get all of these from this restaurant, especially if you go for their buffet.   The buffet includes tasty non-vegetation dishes as well... imo, the hot hot fish curry (if you don't mind burning your mouth) is awesome!  They have a good value lunch buffet (priced below $10) on every weekday (except on holidays)  from 11.30am to 3pm."}
{"text":"After driving by this restaurant many times, we decided to go in. Should have done so a long time ago. The service was friendly. The food was hot, fresh and delicious. The kairali chicken was moist and juicy with just the right amount of heat. The ghee dosa was huge! We also ordered the mutton curry and shrimp biriyani. Everything was great but the price might have been a little higher than other restaurants in the area. Will definitely go back though."}
{"text":"My family loves this restaurant and the chili gobi dry alone brings us back again and again and again!  It's very spicy, with a spice that grows with each bite, and it's addictively delicious!  The butter garlic naan is the best in the city!"}
{"text":"Nice Place for Indian food lover and Biryani lover :).  Visited with my friends.  We have ordered Veg , Nonveg starters and Chicken Biryani and everything was really tasty. Well all I can say is nice to have such South Indian restaurant in Toronto :)"}
{"text":"I have been craving dosa for a few days, and finally got my husband to take me to Karaikudi. We were seated promptly, but it took a whole before we could get the attention of a waiter. We got masala dosa and mutton biryani; dosa was good, but if you are really hungry, the dosa itself may not satisfy. I really loved the sambar, and made sure every last drop got inside my belly!  But let's talk about the mutton biryani. I, myself, barely ever eat mutton because of its distinct smell. This biryani had no smell whatsoever; it was light and fluffy and simply delicious! It was served with an egg, onion raita and sambar (i think) - both my husband and I had smiles on our faces while devouring it. Yum!!! We were asked if we were collecting points (at a restaurant??), which we had no idea about - but if the food is so good, getting a loyalty card would definitely be a wise decision!"}
{"text":"Authentic South Indian Food.  This place had a great atmosphere, it is clean, tidy and organized.  They bring you water, leave you a pitcher of water on the table and the menu is simple and straight forward, lots of vegetarian options and many vegan options on the menu.  While we were here we had Idli's and Channa Batura, they were both amazing and I would highly recommend that you try both if you have never had south Indian food before. It will be an adventure for you, you won't know what to expect and you will not be disappointed.  Food was flavourful and service was great, I would go here again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a total of 3 times over the past year.  Twice for the weekday buffet.  Once for a weekend dinner.  Weekday Buffet ($10.99) - this is pretty decent value.  Highlights are the butter chicken, chickpea dish, paratha, plain dosa roll, chicken briyani rice, vegetable briyani rice.  There is also a selection of soups, yogurt type dishes, small dessert table, fruit.    Everything at the buffet is labelled, so you know what you're eating.  The best part about ethnic buffets is that you can try small tastes of everything you would not normally order.  When I came here for dinner, it was just ok, the prices worked out to be ~$20+ per person, so its not the greatest value.  The dishes are on the small side.    Service for the buffet lunch was not great.  Our table had stacks of plates on the table and they rarely cleared them.  So it got a bit annoying since the table was getting a bit cluttered."}
{"text":"Let me tell you we used to love lamb Briyani from karaikudi, but seriously what we have received today it's not even close to Briyani simply yellow rice with some lamb pieces!!! Why ? What happened to South Indian flavorful taste in Briyani? Not gone order anymore!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great South Indian décor and a good variety of South Indian specialties on the menu. Tough tasty, I found the food a bit too spicy. (I guess that's the way it is supposed to be in India, but it could be a little to severe for Canadians or Canadianized Indians). The Shrimp Masala was excellent and so was their Sukha Mutton. Service was quick. Make sure you have enough place on your table before you order the Paper Dosa."}
{"text":"Pls do your self a favor and don't choose to go here. Instead you should go to the one right in front of this  restaurant called \"Kirali Restaurant'.    I placed an order for Mutton Kothu Rotti over the phone. When I went there and saw the bill I almost fainted.  The cost of a mutton kothu rotti is almost $15 dollars.  The funny thing is it wasn't even enough for one person. I asked the waitress why it is so much for just one mutton kothu rotti , she didn't have an answer for me. I told her this is the last time I am coming here.  She said 'oh thats fine we get enough business from other customers'.   At Kirali Restaurant it is almost $12 and its enough for 2 people.  I would never go back to Karaikudi."}
{"text":"I was just at this place. The customer service was good, but the food was horrible. I got chicken biryani and pepper chicken curry where chicken was really bad and rubbery.  Over priced and poor wu"}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in TO. The food is delicious and the service is good. Get there early and plenty of seating, get there late and prepare to wait!"}
{"text":"Very  busy  spot  reservation  is  recommended  the  briyani  is really good  try  the    chicken 65 and cauliflower  65 as well  great  place  for  vegetarians.  Full of  flavour  and  spice"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I dined at an Indian restaurant so I was looking forward to this one after a friend had recommended it.  Service was friendly and courteous.  So that alone would make me want to go back.  Since there was a group of us, we were able to taste a number of dishes.    Because Indian food is not exactly cheap nor are the portions big, I'll base my individual ratings mainly on the quality of the food and their prices/portions. This may be helpful to those who are new to South Asian dining.   [Appetizers] Chili Gobi Dry - Sort of like their version of vegetable tempura.  Was very nicely seasoned so it was very flavourful.  Because it's deep fried, it was of course a little on the greasy side.  4/5.   Devil Chicken - If you like spicy, then you'd like this dish.  I didn't find it overly spicy that you would lose its flavour so I thoroughly enjoyed this.  Good sized platter and with the flavour of the chicken, I give it 5/5.  [Side Dishes] Chili Chicken - Very very nice.  You get a good amount of garnishing along with the good amount of chicken.  Definitely worth the cost. 5/5.  Butter Chicken - Didn't exactly try the chicken but I definitely tried the sauce. I've never had such creamy sauce.  Was so creamy that it was even a little bit on the sweet side.  I usually have Butter Chicken with Basmati Rice but due to dietary restrictions (I know, dietary restrictions but going to an Indian restaurant.. lame), I instead enjoyed it with some of their Garlic Naan and a piece of Parotta (I'll get to those shortly).  Some people drink the Swiss Chalet sauce and if I weren't watching my diet right now, I'd be drinking this sauce, too.  5/5.  Boiled Egg - I know it's boiled egg but some people don't know how to boil a damn egg. I'm a (self acclaimed) egg connoisseur and I must say that these babies were boiled perfectly. If this were a scene from A Hundred Foot Journey (which every foodie should watch, by the way), I'd hire the person who was in charge of boiling eggs to be my Head Chef. Or maybe just my main boiler. 5/5.  [Indian Breads] Parotta - Delicious.  Definitely a must have along with that delicious Butter Chicken especially if you're a lame-o like me trying to avoid as much rice as possible. 5/5.  Garlic Naan - As delicious as it was, I felt a little cheated.  Seemed like they just took some plain Naan and brushed it with some butter and garlic.  Again, don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but I've had better.  Specifically at Samosa King where I literally wait 10-minutes for the fresh Garlic Naan.  The difference? The one at Samosa King seems to be kneaded directly with the minced garlic and then brushed with butter.  Because of the amount they give you, though, I'd give it 5/5.    [Biryani] Chicken Biryani - You're given a choice of boneless or bone-in chicken.  The difference is basically white meat/breast or drumsticks, respectively. That's what I'm assuming anyway because that's what I got and let's face it, drumsticks are cheaper to serve.  You also won't really know until you receive it and after digging underneath the rice (yes, I caved in and ordered rice). Boneless I'm assuming is white meat since there's a difference in price.  $2 to be exact.  With each order, you'll also receive a boiled egg.  Going back to Samosa King, I've had their Chicken Biryani but I prefer this one better.  Found the flavour of this one a little simpler yet very satisfying. But focusing on the price vs quality/quantity, I'd give it 4/5.    Overall it was a pleasant experience and I would definitely go back.  Because of its richness, though, I'd wait a little while to go back.  As active as I am, I'm probably still burning the calories earned from this lunch."}
{"text":"Went with my family for a special day out and I was greatly disappointed. We ordered chicken lollipops for starters with the rest of our meal. Gave our entire meal order at the same time cause it was hard to get a server to our table. We realized it would be a while before a server would come again to take our meal order. Well, the starters came much after the meal. Very disappointing! The food was ok but the service - wasn't good at all. People around us were upset too for the same reason. They just wanted to pay and get out after the long wait for food. Thought we wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"Been here once and will definitely return for more. Had the Kothu Roti the first time around and its my favorite Kothu Roti in all of Toronto. The quantity was great for the 9.99 price tag.  Service was good and prompt, family had the dosa, peas and puri and they loved it too though they managed to finish their food (mine I had to doggies bag as well)  Worth a visit and also a repeat trip for sure."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Today was my second time and I took my colleague along with me. She is not indian so this was her first experience. We ordered dosas and she loved it. I've had dosas at quite a few places but I've got to say the service and the taste of the dosas here is amazing. I also highly recommend their masala chai. It has such great flavour of cardamom and ginger. Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Friendly staff,  great atmosphere,  onion pakoras taste like kfc chicken.  Must try the paper masala dosa at least once in your lifetime.  Biggest dosa ever.  Reasonable prices.   Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"Great spot if you are looking to try non-vegetarian south Indian food. My favorite from the menu is mutton Biryani."}
{"text":"After craving for some South India food and being disappointed by many restaurants I came upon this place.  During the first visit I had the Veg. thali and Mr. H had the Uttappam. We also tried the Mutton Sukka and they were all delicious. The Mutton Sukka actually would make me come back... again and again.  During the second visit Mr. H and I both tried their biriyani's (Chicken and Mutton) and Oh My God! It was the best thing ever! The rice was so soft and moist, the mutton would melt in your mouth and the spicy flavour was just right.   Once again however, my food was better than Mr. H's, he did like his Chicken Biriyani a lot but the Mutton was awesome. Their service is pretty good and fast.  Next time I try the fish biriyani. :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. I usually come during the buffet. The buffet is actually a good deal, $9.99. The food is super tasty and is truly authentic.  The buffet has a decent amount of selection, ranging from a rice dish, soups, sambar, salad, naan or parotta, pakodas, chicken, and shrimp dishes etc. There are usually three desserts, payasam, kesari and fruit.  I will tell you, their dosas are the best. It is so fresh and crunchy. One time I came in the evening when they had a la carte and I ordered the paper dosa. It was huge but it tasted so good. The dosas are highly recommended."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  I bought a Groupon for this place (after checking the great reviews on Yelp) and went last night with my wife and a neighbour.  We had the following;  Aloo Gobi Masala...9.99 -Potatoes and cauliflower in Indian gravy Mutter Paneer...10.99 -Peas and cottage cheese curry Dal Makhni...8.99 -Home-style black lentils Kathirikkai Kara Kulambu...8.99 -Spicy and sour eggplant curry, goes well with rice  They were all very good and had distinct flavours.  The eggplant was quite spicy (hot).  There were plenty of cheese cubes in the mutter paneer.  We also had an order of plain rice, plain naan and raita.  My mango lassi was excellent.  Very thick and mango-y, without being overly sweet.   The only weakness occurred when we ordered Papadum as an appetizer.  There were three of us, and she brought 2 papadums.  Weird.  It is clean, has nice decor, and is worth the drive to Scarborough."}
{"text":"Not any value for your money...run away from the place if you think its vegetarian friendly!! The vegetarian items are so over priced with meagre quantities...i spent almost 14$ on entrees which had spartan snacky amounts...would not come back here ...sorryy !!"}
{"text":"Great food but need to work on customer service. It is on the pricier side but its always fresh and excellent quality so I'm not complaining. We would come more and bring more people if they were halal. Make it halal please!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite place to grab Indian food. I fell in love with this place years ago because their butter chicken is incredibly buttery and their lamb briyani is delicious but what I do not like is their prices. I find them a lot more expensive than other places (~$13.99 for a small bowl of butter chicken). Their naan bread gets pretty pricey as well (an additional $0.50 for butter naan).   Although the people who work there are nice, I find them usually short staffed even during busy hours. They have a loyalty program to collect point using your phone number which then can be redeemable for credit at the restaurant which is nice."}
{"text":"I liked my dosa. But I was influenced by my family. Dosa arrived 2 min after ordering.  Before our drinks. Red wine poured back into bottle."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Food is ok. Particularly the briyani is horrible. Looks like turmeric mixed rice..... Appetizers are good.....Ok restaurant and spoling the name"}
{"text":"This is a hawker food stall labeled a restaurant.  Food is below average but prices are high.  My wife ordered idly and it was like s rock.  The corn soup tasted like sugary strap.  They sprinkle a lot of black pepper and call it Chettinad.  Please do not insult Chettinad food.  No more Karaikudi."}
{"text":"The service was great, food was (omg) delicious, and their mango lassi and milk shake was amazing!  We ordered: Cheese Masala Dosa (8/10) Devil Chicken (7/10) I might be a bit bias about this one  Butter Chicken (9/10) Mutton Biriyani (9/10) Garlic Naan and Cheese Naan (10/10) Mango Lassi (9/10) Mango Milkshake (10/10)  The only downside is that the prices are a bit more expensive than others.  Amazing first experience, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is the best south Indian restaurant in Toronto. Their idlis are simply amazing. Being a vegetarian, I can not say much about the non-veg dishes though."}
{"text":"Good place to get some fresh Sri Lankan food. I got the Dosa and butter chicken. The dosa was big enough to share and still fill us up. The prices were a bit high, dosas averaged around 11-15$. And the quantity for butter chicken was small.    The vibe is super down low. Perfect for date night.   The staff is nice and knowledgable. If you don't know the ingredients they'll explain it to you properly.   Came here a second time with a larger group. We booked ahead and they were super accommodating with us.  Their menu is super diverse with options for everyone. All the dishes we got were delicious and filling.   Masala Butter panner - this is the sauce of butter chicken but instead of chicken, they use paneer. It's a mix of sweet and spicy and so creamy and delicious. There were enough pieces and made the curry super thick. The panner was super soft.   Veg Manchurian Gravy - crispy fried balls with a sweet Manchurian sauce.  The inside is fried dough mixed with vegetables. Super delicious and can definitely be eaten on it's own.   Chilli panner dry - this was my least favorite dish, however I still thought it was good. It's dry, fried tofu mixed with chilli. I felt there was alot of taste other than chilli, however if you're someone who loves spice, this is definitely the dish for you  Falooda- the drink was absolutely terrible. It barely tasted like an Falooda and instead tasted more like ice cream mixed with yogurt. The portion was way too small for the price it was."}
{"text":"We ordered their Masala Dosa and butter chicken. Masala dosa was really delicious. Butter chicken was as usual a bit sweet for our taste but I guess some people prefer it like that. Over all the food was good. Our favourite was hands down the Masala dosa."}
{"text":"The place was really busy and people were flocking for the food. It was very good service and probably the biggest Dosa I have ever seen. Try the indian coffee- it is an experience of its own. tastes a bit like ovaltine mixed with coffee. Very Tasty.   The vegetable's that came with the dosa were really good. The Sambar was delicious- so was the potato and cocunut raita.   Pepper Chicken was unique and different from the typical indian dishes. The only issue I had was the channai paratha was over priced and not worth the value. i would just get dosa or the naan's. Overall - had a great experience."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, there is a good reason why the dining room fills up.  Delicious and authentic South Indian food with attentive serving staff and a comfortable dining room.  Top marks go for each dish we ordered in our group. We all love spice and color in the way we eat and can not imagine being able to carry on a friendship with someone who does not eat like us!  Mutton...perfect.  Shrimp Biryani...perfect.  Dosa...to die for!  Joined their points program because we plan on returning often. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was great, a hidden gem! I got the mysali dosa and the idly. It was delicious I highly recommend it. The severs were prompt and all the food came out on time. I recommend this place for anyone having a dosa craving!"}
{"text":"Good food but expensive.  Tried devil's chicken, quantity is very poor compared to price"}
{"text":"If you enjoy spicy flavour filled meals, then this is definitely the place to go! The waiters/waitresses are fast, the restaurant is clean and the food is always consistent with taste. If you're not sure what to get, the waitresses are really helpful too! I would make reservations if you're going on a weekend evening or Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"Kairakudi is a popular restaurant frequented by South Indian and Tamil clientele, but offers a range of North and South Indian dishes.      The food and service is excellent.  Fast attentive wait staff work with quick kitchen staff to bring your meal quickly.   My only minor complaint is the sauces for the North Indian dishes are too similar (or same) such as Butter Chicken and Mutter Paneer which are almost identical flavour.  Recommended: Paper Dosa , for the ridiculous size and good Facebook photo moment!"}
{"text":"A decent place for a chettinadu cuisine. Nothing is bad at this place, ambiance, menu & service. I like their devil chicken."}
{"text":"The food her gets 4 stars, however the service was definitely a 1 star as the waiter almost contributed to the death of one of my friends.   I came here with a group of friends this past Sunday prior to catching a movie. One of my friends and I decided to share an appetizer and a couple of mains. For appetizer we settled on the ghee dosa which is basically a crepe cooked in ghee (clarified butter) and served with 3 condiments for dipping. OMFG the dosa was sublime! It was extremely crispy and flaky. The dough had a great buttery taste from the ghee; I do not even want to know how many calories were in this thing. The accompanying condiments were all good (I was not a huge fan of the coconut sambal) but otherwise these were great to dip our crispy dosa in. The presentation of the dosa was awesome too, served in the shape of a mountain this resulted in a couple of cool photo ops.  For mains my friend and I decided to get mutton biryani and butter chicken with garlic naan. The biryani was very good, it had a nice kick and the mutton in it was very tender. If you do get the biryani eat with caution as there were small bones in the mutton and whole spices and seeds for flavouring so be sure to pick these out or risk getting a mouthful of anise seed, as I did. The biryani was also served with 2 condiments; I enjoyed the yogurt with onions as it really balanced out the spiciness of the biryani.  The butter chicken was a pleasant surprise too considering that it is not a south Indian dish. The chicken was served in boneless chunks which were quite large, the gravy was very creamy and not very spicy, this dish was very enjoyable.   This was my first experience with south Indian food and all in all the food was very good, our entire table enjoyed their dishes. The service on the other hand was pretty dismal. Our young waiter seemed intimidated by our group of 7 people; it was clear that most of our table was not familiar with the menu items but he did not offer any explanations or provide us with any suggestions. My other friend wanted to order the biryani also but asked the waiter if it contained nuts (he has a severe allergy) the waiter came back and said the biryani contained cashews. My friend and his girlfriend proceeded to say that they would just share a masala dosa and a side of kotthu roti. The waiter brought them their food but failed to mention that the kotthu roti also contained cashews. My friend luckily caught this within a couple of bites but it was too late, he already had a reaction and had to leave to go get medication. The waiter looked stunned when we told him what happened and said it was a miscommunication, we spoke to the manager and he gave my friend and his girlfriend their dinner for free. I hope they learn from this mistake and start to take food allergies more seriously because if it was a child or something the situation could have been a lot worse.   The restaurant itself was pretty average in terms of décor and it definitely has an authentic Indian feel (most of the patrons were Indian/Sri Lankan). The prices were fair and most dishes were in the $8-13 dollar range. Bonus for having 2 Indian beers in stock! I will likely return and give them a second chance but they need to step up their game in the service department!"}
{"text":"Great value and decent number of options for their lunch buffet. There are curries, chutneys, rice dishes, and breads for dipping. They even have a dessert section for their lunch buffet. I also appreciate how quickly the replenish their dishes, so you never have to wait long to try something.   Warning: their dishes are spicy and if you can't handle spice, their dishes will set fire to your digestive system.   I have been told that the dishes are quite traditional. However, it was odd seeing Szechuan chicken, but it tasted more Indian than Chinese to me.   If you're coming for lunch on a weekday you can probably get away with not making a reservation.   My one complaint is the inefficiency of their payment system. They don't split bills, and requested that we pay in cash if we wanted to pay separately."}
{"text":"The flavour of food that you get here is unbelievable, I have never been disappointed with any of the dishes that I have ordered!! The service however could be improved, I feel as if the staff have to be more attentive and approach customers with a friendly attitude, rather than their usual manner! The butter chicken is authentic! Make sure you try it if you ever visit this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The sambar lentil soup was good and not too spicy. Egg dosa was sort of pricy but a huge size. I tried the mutton sukka masala (sp?) was so good and not too spicy."}
{"text":"I genuinely liked almost everything here, But when I tried to return a dish (dessert) which did not reach min standard (Not sweet at all which by basic purpose has failed) they refused to do that, which I really felt unhappy about."}
{"text":"After seeing decent yelp reviews, I stopped by for dinner today. Service was ok, we only waited 5-10 min for our meals to be prepared. My dosa was crispy and well filled with malasa potato mix. My friend had the chicken disk, a little on the small side and didnt like the bones still in. But otherwise delicious flavour.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here. Its an ok restaurant. I've had better dosa in Mississauga (check out my review of dosa palace)."}
{"text":"Beautiful ethnic decor and good food. Their egg pepper dry fry as an appetizer is zingy & delicious. Their dosas are very good with ample amount of spicy potato filling. Their veg-biryani was excellent. The staff is very friendly and dining here is a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Well, the amount of food served for the money is very small. There are lot's of other indian places that will serve better quality and quantity for less than what these guys are charging. ---Just 7 or 8 small cubes of chicken in a butter chicken dish costing 12.99. -a small bowl of steamed rice costs 5 bucks!  I am not coming back for sure, to me Indian restaurants should not be this expensive as it is nowhere near fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. This is the 4th time I've eaten here, or gotten take out. The flavor is generally pretty good, but every time the food has been lukewarm, or the sauce is hot but the centre of the meat is cold. I've concluded that everything is reheated instead of cooked from fresh. Time to find another Indian place to eat in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Chettinad Chicken masala the sauce is good but chicken little pieces bones they cut the chicken tight into 4 not good for the value $12.99  rate poor Boneless chicken biriyani was excellent.   Fish Fry was not fresh very fishy."}
{"text":"Went there for a dinner.  Very nice and clean place. Relaxing atmosphere. Very nice and polite customer service. Food was very delicious and flavourful.  Mushrooms 65 and fry fish was delicious. Shrimp Masala was amazing and so was the Mutton do Piaza. Everything had the right amount of spices and the portions were generous.  Great lassis as well. The one thing they should improve is the quality of their naan. It was little dry."}
{"text":"Great place for Sri Lankan/ South Indian food! I have visited so many other places around the Toronto area but this is the best sit down restaurant for Tamil food. We went there as a big group for a friend's birthday and they had delicious food. Their portions are huge and you will have plenty to take home.   The decor was good and they did a good job with the service. I got paper dosa and it was really huge (So big I had to get my friends to help me finish it). Appertizers were delicious ( Chilli chicken, Tandoori chicken and Chilli Gobi) - my friends got various types of biriyanis and they enjoyed it. We finished the dinner off with some desserts (Carrot halwa) and masala tea. Loved everything!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Arrived around 7:30 which was great because after 8pm it filled up quickly and there was a wait Ronnie seated. The decor is nice but tables were too close together. We ordered the following:  paper masala dosa- it was HUGE! It was nice and crispy and delicious... chutneys were just ok  Egg biriyani- rice was light fluffy overall was tasty  Fish fry- only got a fillet was expecting more, taste was great but was pretty spicy!  Uttapam- not bad not great  Vadai- hot and crispy outside with a soft inside!  Overall was a great first experience!"}
{"text":"The food was expensive but tasted bland. Spicy with no true flavour. Service was not the best. They just dumped plates and we had to lay them out."}
{"text":"Not worth the buffet for 13.99. The buffet refills took so long that we did not eat most of the items. The cook was catering to the people who order off the menu and the buffet was refilled at the end. It took for ever to get even the water. Would avoide buffet. May be food is food if you order off the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. We love the bread and the kothu roti please the restaurant is nice and clean. One down thing is the service, it is terrible"}
{"text":"I needed to buy a hard drive at Staples* so I stopped here for a late lunch/snack.  The table next to me ordered a butter chicken and biryani. I went with a Masala Cheese Dosa for $13.99. At that (high) price, I could have had a meat or seafood dish but I really wanted a dosa. In fact, I decided recently that I should learn to make dosas at home so that we could all enjoy them without spending $100.  My dosa arrived promptly - even before my neighbours' order. At first sight, I started to feel happy. Then, I smelled it. Very happy now. First taste of the crispy dosa and curried potato filling. In Nirvana! Learning to make my own dosa? Fuhgeddaboudit!  I overheard my neighbours asking the waiter about my order. I told them what it was and mentioned that it was delicious. The man exclaimed, \"I know! I had it last time I was here but couldn't remember the name so I couldn't order it!\"  He, he. Felt a little sorry for him but just a little.  * Btw, the Staples store is many kilometres away. I just needed an excuse to get my dosa fix."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant as it serves authentic South Indian Food that includes non-vegetarian options.I have been here several times and like it coz they have various options - from the Paper Masala Dosa to the Shrimp Curry to the Biryani. Everything is prepared well and I have never had concerns from any of my colleagues and friends. The only thing to watch out is that the spice level is quite high. Their mild version too can be spicy for some (LOL!).  Apart from the food, there are a few key things I like about the place 1. They take the orders through a tablet. It's pretty professional and if you have asked for some changes, there is an entry to it. 2. The staff is friendly but more importantly efficient - they realize that given the large range of items on the menu, some items take time. They make sure that they ask for your preferences as to when you want it 3. They have a nice party hall that you can use for hosting events. Inform the folks that you have a special event and they'll make some \"personal space\" for you. 4. They have some Loyalty / Rewards scheme out there. I was pleasantly surprised when the lady told me that I had been here before and had accumulated some points and got a discount. Overall, it's a authentic south indian restaurant with solid management driving the quality and experience."}
{"text":"My husband grew up in Kerala, so we're always lookin' to score some tasty South Indian bites. We found Karaikudi online and made the voyage based upon the promise of nandu masala (crab curry), one of our favorites. When we arrived, we found the restaurant to be actually quite far on the outskirts of Toronto. It is in kind of a weird, largely unoccupied shopping complex. When you go inside, you find that it feels a lot like a traditional South Indian restaurant. The buffet had lots of South Indian morsels, so we decided against the nandu masala that we'd planned on. Instead, we had chai, veda with sambar, Chicken 65, avial, shrimp fry, really nice dosa, payasam and several other curries. The service was inconsistent. The food was okay. I'll agree with Ray that it was solid. We just keep looking for South Indian food that is better than the foods we make at home, or that my mother-in-law prepares. The quest continues. At $9.99 per buffet, this was a lot of food for lunch. With a buffet waiting for diners, it is a shame that you must make multiple requests for dosa (served fresh, not on the buffet), water, and chai. Not sure what keeps the waiters so busy with the buffet going on. The dosa were really good and actually better than those served at Udupi Palace on Gerrard."}
{"text":"One of the only South Indian  restaurants that is consistently good. Best  things here would be mutton sukka, lollipop  chicken, any biriyani or fried rice  , chilli chicken, shrimp masala, pepper chicken,  shrimp 65 poori amd garlic  naan"}
{"text":"Good chetinad food. And spicy enough even for my palette. Ambience was also good. Overall a good experience and will visit again."}
{"text":"I came here for the Indian buffet and was sorely disappointed by the limited selection of food available. I've been to a lot of Indian buffets and was surprised to find that they didn't have paneer or butter chicken or any of the masala dishes that I normally see in an Indian buffet. Heck, there wasn't even naan there. Their dessert selection was also disappointing. It had a total of 5 items: a rice pudding like dish (Payasam), an orange mash like dish (Kesari), and 3 trays of old looking diced fruits (cantaloupe, honeydew, apple/fruit mix). I was so sad that I couldn't find the gulab jamun! This is the first time ever that I didn't go back for a second helping in a buffet (I'm normally a glutton, what can I say?).  They advertise their buffet saying that there's over 30 items in there but there definitely wasn't. There was maybe 10 or so that were considered actually food (the rest being sauces). The food also wasn't very appetizing for me to even want to go for seconds. For $12.99, there are way better buffets out there with way more appetizing options.   The quality of the food there was lacking. The mixed fruits that were available were browned and warm. The deep fried foods were soggy. The szechuan chicken (weird that it was in an Indian restuarant in the first place) was overly fatty. A lot of the food just isn't that great compared to other buffets. Of course, I don't expect fine dining with an Indian buffet but having gone to quite a few of them, this is one of the worse places I've been to.   It seems a lot of reviewers here recommend ordering a la carte. Maybe the quality is better othere. But given the quality of the food they rolled out for the buffet, I won't be back to try their menu items."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite South Indian restaurants in Toronto. The food is always good and fast but not hurried competent service as well.   Must try the dragon (or is it Devil) chicken to start. The have the mutton kotu roti as main. Channa batura is also soooo good."}
{"text":"Ventured here with a Groupon after seeing decent reviews on Yelp, I decided to purchase this and give it a try. It is usually a hit or miss with Indian cuisine or so I've noticed at least.   I dined here with a friend for lunch and there was a pretty good crowd in there although the outside appearance is deceiving. We were greeted and the server was very friendly, I believe the manager or owner came by and asked us if it was our first visit here and inquired if we had any questions in regards to the menu. Very friendly!  We got the Butter Chicken and Aloo Gobi Masala as I tend to stick on the vegetarian side when I am eating Indian food. The food was very tasty and flavourful. The overall price of the meal was fairly decent for the quality of the food, this is a hidden gem for Indian food. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Food was served cold and we had to returned the food to warm up. We ordered yougurt and received it after we finished!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Indian/Sri Lankan restaurant in Scar. Been there like 5-6 times already and enjoy the garlic and butter naans with butter chicken and chicken biryani is delish. Bit pricy but worth the price. Rasmali is great dessert."}
{"text":"Love!   I'd be happy if I could have plain dosa with the butter chicken and chilli gobi (dry) everyday.   My go to place for Indian food was downtown's India Palace, but it's closed down and Little India has finally won that awkward side-by-side competition. Having tried food from both, i'll always love India Palace and think their food was actually better.   Anyhow, Karaikudi has a warm atmosphere with friendly staff. I had a large dosa here for the first time and it took me by surprise- a beautifully crisp golden rolled crepe served with 3 chutneys. Dip it into the butter chicken sauce and that's where the money's at.   We also ordered the aloo gobi, naan, raita and chilli gobi (mild) with a side of rice. If you're not too great with spice as we were, definitely ask to get the chilli gobi mild. The first time I got it, it just lit our tongues on fire - but still delicious!   Do yourself a life favour and try the galub jamun with ice cream for dessert. If you haven't tried galub jamuna before it's a delicious donut-like fried ball in warm syrup. But then they add vanilla ice- cream and it melts into the syrup. #drool  Definitely a new Scarborough staple in my book.  P.S. They collect points!!! All I know is points or not, i'm coming back. I've already been here 3 times in 3 weeks and plan to take friends to check it out next week."}
{"text":"We have tried this place once. The food is good but could be better. Don't get me wrong, I would still recommend folks to try this place at least once and judge if they like it or not. My opinion is that I have had better South Indian food back in the States. Hence I am taking away 2 stars."}
{"text":"Overall:  Authentic fiery south indian food, great value  Room: Like a modern a/c restaurant in India, with dark wood furniture, and a regular rotation of current and classic Tamil hits on the stereo  Service: Friendly, nice, people, but a star lost for occasional forgetfulness   Menu: I've only gone at lunch for the buffet, and it's a solid selection, and focuses on food from the Chettinad region in Tamil Nadu, which is known for its specific spiciness.    Presentation: Buffet, not much to say, dosa made on request, south indian coffee delivered traditionally, held in steel cup placed upside down in a steel saucer  Taste:  Delivers on south indian vegetarian goodness.    Healthiness:  Good, but not great, quite a bit of oil   Value: Excellent, what you'd expect for Scarborough dining"}
{"text":"Super dosas spicy chutneys/curries If you have *white taste buds your in for one spicy hell of a ride thru the long dosa tunnel  Mutton was chewy chetinad gravy was nice n spicy Highlight was obviously ghee paper dosa bit on the $$ side   Serves halal mutton/chicken"}
{"text":"Curry Wasp or Bee on my dinner and ends up almost $50.00 a dinner last night? Why am I get served and ends up not listening to my customer service where I am not going to eat this place where I am not going back there again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars here.  Tandori chicken was really good! The spicy chicken dipped in cooking yoghurt made me crave for more.  Extra large 'crepe like thing was ok. Wasnt a fan of the dips that they offered with it. Though loved the presentation and crisp of the crepe.  Mango lassi was delicious too. Rasmalay was great though my gf didnt like the texture too much. Expensive though for 2 pcs$5 Service was slow, there was only 1 server/hostess when we arrived. 2 more staff cane after , spacious and clean looking place. Worth going  Collect point of every dollar spent. $200 =$-10 .   Would go back to try other items."}
{"text":"I went here once for their buffet as a kid and wasn't a fan but thought I would give it another chance now.   Price Range (Not Including Tax & Tip) : $8-$15 per entree. For a Tamil/Indian place I would see it's a bit pricer than I expected.   Food Quality (Taste, Portion, Menu) - 2/5  We had the Paper Dosa, Veggie Kothu Roti, Mango Lassi and Garlic Naan. I wasn't a fan of the food at all besides the Mutter Paneer and Naan. The Kothu Roti had no flavour and didn't have many roti pieces. I found the dosa to be too grainy compared to other places I've had it at. The dosa was more of a novelty as it was huge!  I liked the Naan a lot and found the paneer alright. I loved the Mango Lassi, this was the best part of the meal. They have a pretty big menu, a lot of options both veggie and meat. The portions for weren't as big as I expected, I'd say it was on the smaller side.   Atmosphere - 4/5 It has an Indian palace vibe which I really liked. The places was well decorated and it looked very picturesque.  They have a lot of seats as it is a fairly big place, so it works well for any size of group. They have their own parking lot so it's really easy to find a parking spot.   Service - 5/5 The staff was really nice and courteous. They were very prompt in taking our order, checking that the meal was okay and refilling our water. The food came out pretty quick and came out together as well.  Would I go again? Maybe 1 more try? For the most part I don't think I would go again. Theres a bunch of other places that I prefer.   Lash's Recommendations  Mango Lassi - The consistency and flavour is amazing. It's pretty filling too!   Garlic Naan - Perfect compliment for any of the curry dishes."}
{"text":"mostly i get Boneless chicken and Chicken kothu ...loved it ..Cant go regularly  a bit expensive.."}
{"text":"Great south Indian food. Parathas and curries are good. Surprising their Chinese is pretty good too. Certainly recommend it."}
{"text":"Karaikudi has a special place on our weekly roster thanks to their Fried Fish (King fish). Wifey loves it and doesn't share! :(  Our server is a pleasant guy (every time the same person) and dumb that I am sometimes, I always forget to take his name.  The places itself is nestled away in comfortable area with plenty of parking and on weekends there's a wait.   Food itself is appealing. Standard items like Dosas, Idly, Vada and appetizers are fairly good. We recently tried Kothu Roti which was very filling and worth every penny. The Mutton Biryaani is one the best in eastern hemisphere so give it a shot.  They recently upgraded and now they take orders on a tab. Adds to the glamour quotient. I know, I'm a sucker for technology!"}
{"text":"When in Toronto the possibilities are plenty for any type of cuisine. We felt like having something spicy so we chose this place.  We have never eaten south indian food before and it turns out that whatever we knew from punjabi cuisine doesn't really apply here beyond the traditional names. Hence butter chicken is always a safe bet, which it was. The goat vindaloo was really spicy for us as were the other dishes. We left impressed with the service and taste.  However, this brings me to the bad part. As always with indian food, we feel that it is a hit or a miss and hard to anticipate before we walk in a place. While we left satisfied, half an hour later we were very close to regretting our decision to eat here. Massive heartburn, nausea and the like. While I don't really blame them, it is something to consider for someone who doesn't eat spicy on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch Buffet. It' s $ 10.99 during weekdays. Compare to my previous visit, this time I noticed  choices were limited.  Restaurant was quite busy and only one server and a helper was working. Took forever to get the drinks.  When we are expected to pay the full price, I didn't like the discounted service and food selection."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Sunday night:  My husband, two sons and I.  I did some research and we came because this restaurant met our requirements: nearest to home, Dosa on the menu and they served meat.  Our menu consisted of:  Masala Dosa and Mysore Masala Dosa, Sambar (I didn't realize that the dosa came with 2 each or I wouldn't have ordered it, but it is awesome), Garden salad, Chicken Biriyani, Butter Chicken (this was just OK, a bit too mild for my taste) and Naan.  All this for $60 and we had leftovers.  I would go back for the DOSA it was really, really good.  Also, just a note, we arrived early (at 4:45 pm) so it was quite empty, but the service was spectacular!"}
{"text":"The butter chicken here is good but when we ordered the second one it tasted completely different, it was very sweet compared to the other one that was buttery and a bit more spicy. When I addressed the issue they told me all butter chicken was cooked in the same pot that even if they change it, it would have been the same. I am really confused as of why all 4 of us agreed that it was different and even the colour was different. The food here is ok but the service here is horrible I would not return."}
{"text":"Had our work lunch here on this fine sunny April Wednesday!  Recommended by our south Indian co-worker.  If you are coming from down from 401, the building is a bit angle to the south on your left side behind a parking lot (try not to miss it =P).    I had high hopes.  I knew south Indian cuisine would be super Spicy!  But was hoping to have some variety of other non spicy dishes / options.  Unfortunately, even the fried rice where mildly spicy :(  I had the butter chicken, it looks dry and actually over cooked.  Even on the second batch. So sad ... definitely for $12.99/pp I'd have expected more.  Highlight of the visit:  Co-Worker ordered us a paper dosa each.  It's like a thin crepe made with rice, coconut and etc.  The dipping sauce was yogurt ish and very tasty.     Food (Taste): 2/5 Food (Presentation): 3/5 Kitchen (Delivery Speed): (N/A)/5 - it's a buffet :) the paper dosa took a few mins. Service: 1/5 - no one came to grab our dirty / finished plates.   Ambiance: 4/5 - nice quiet place to have some chats with friends / co-workers Fun Factor: 2/5"}
{"text":"I come here very often because of  the delicious Butter Chicken and Fresh Naan, and the normally great service.   Recently the dinner service here is a bit slow and disorganized. Seems a bit understaffed on the floor, but a couple newer servers are disorganized and perhaps better suited in non customer facing jobs. At least not the service field.   I came for dinner with a friend...twice... Praising this place on great food and service. But was disappointed he didn't get to witness that.  Our entrées were brought to the table 20 mins apart - so he ate cold food once mine finally arrived. Both times lol (not funny tho) An item we ordered never arrived at all, but wasn't billed so we didn't bother mentioning when we paid.   New server squirted water on our food while spraying an empty table beside ours. And each time we inquired on our missing food items - she would ask \"oh did you order it\".   Ummm NO, we sent telepathic messages to the food and hoped it would come on its own!!! REALLY? But she never offered TO CHECK ON THE ITEM FOR US  ...hellloooooo geeez  Finally mentioned to a manager (owner?) who was going to check, until the cashier said she would...but then she never did. [Scratches head!]  I still love this place and hope they work out the training issues with floor staff. They do have a couple really terrific servers - who work their butts off, try to spot them and sit in their area if u eat here in the near future  Hope mgt reads this and improves the weak areas.  Because I love the food.    Update: Went for lunch buffet today with colleagues and the service was so much faster. I wish it were as quick for dinner, and that the buffet were available evenings.  Our group of 10+ colleagues vote for buffet at dinner service too"}
{"text":"The food at this place has definitely dipped in taste. Everything looked great, but didn't taste very authentic or good. The chutney, sambhar etc that came with it was quite bland. There are far better places. Even the thali (meal) was average at best. Unless there's no better place to go, I'd give it a miss."}
{"text":"A group of us went to this restaurant on the weekend to take advantage of their \"pay-once-eat-twice\" anniversary promo. We could smell the delicious food as we drove up, even though our windows were closed. Conversely, despite the mouth-watering aromas that greeted us, we didn't actually smell like cooking when we got home, so their ventilation must be really good. Our server was a really nice genuine guy. For 6 people it ended up being about $30/person (a la carte) so it was a little pricey compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to. But the decor is nice, they play all the popular Tamil music and the food was all very yummy. I would recommend this restaurant if you're jonesing for some authentic Chetinnad cuisine :)"}
{"text":"Came with my family here first of all the food is extremely bad. There is no taste, I do know how Indian food must taste , it was tasteless and very cold. Garlic naan did not taste anything like it. And the worst part was falooda that is listed under dessert is not a dessert but is a cold beverage. My voucher that had wouldn't cover cold beverage and I was told don't believe what's on the menu.  The waitress had so much attitude and told the manager was on break while she was right across collecting bills. This is the worst experience I ever had at a restaurant and treated bad. Never coming back here ever ."}
{"text":"I usually love coming here with my family for their large paper masala dosa. Unfortunately this time it was much smaller, like half the size than what we usually get. It was also very flat when usually its round and puffed. The main thing we didn't like this time is that it had a weird texture, as if the mixture wasn't blended properly before cooking. Other than that, the garlic naan and butter chicken are always good. I would highly recommend getting shrimp 65 for appetizers, it's really spicy and flavourful! Overall this place is nice to come to once in a while, but I have to say it's way too overpriced for the portions they give."}
{"text":"Ordered fish fry, mutton sukka and coffee. Mutton was on tougher side, and fish was alright. The coffee was the only saving grace here."}
