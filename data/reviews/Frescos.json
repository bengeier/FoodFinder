{"text":"I reserved a room here for my husbands surprise 40th birthday party and it was absolutely perfect! The staff was so helpful and kind. They allowed our family in an hour early to set up. They gave great recommendations for set up. It was so easy. The party was great. They allowed us to bring in a cake from elsewhere and cut and served it for us. I wish they would have served larger slices as a lot of our friends were asking for seconds of the cake and there was a lot left over. Aside from that I couldn't be happier with the outcome!"}
{"text":"It was a little rough finding this place, as another reviewer has stated.  Across Rt19 from Whole Foods and off the highway a bit, but totally worth trying to find it.  My wife and I only went because we had a Groupon, but we were both very glad we went.  Food was great, service was excellent, environment was wonderful.    I didn't really see it as much of a \"family\" type of restaurant, and there were no small children there when we were there.  I am wondering if Julie K. down there actually went to the restaurant or if she is just looking for something to bitch about."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place! Despite the fantastic ambiance inside and out, the food was bland and boring. The service was also slow, and it was a quiet Thursday night when we visited. We probably won't be back unless we hear that they have a new chef."}
{"text":"Please tell me why ONLY the women restrooms have diaper changing stations?!! Why don't the mens restrooms? Seriously!! This is very sexist and what if a single dad!?! I notice guy after guy coming back from attempting to change their baby's diapers to just pass them off to the mom or have to do it in the hallway!! WAKE UP and simply install changing stations in the Mens restroom!"}
{"text":"I hesitated to write this because it seemed so implausible that we waited for close to 40 minutes to have our order taken, I feared no one would believe it.  But I see that someone else had the same problem!  After waiting about 10 minutes, our waiter appeared to tell us he'd be with us soon.  \"Soon\" didn't happen for a very long time.  We were with friends who had recommended the place based on food served at a Chadwick event (same kitchen, we're told) and we were enjoying our conversation, so decided to not make a fuss, but finally when a manager looking person appeared at a table near us, we asked if we would get service soon.  Our waiter magically appeared.  Service after that was mediocre.  I went to the bar myself to get a drink rather than \"bothering\"our waiter.  Many tables were empty, so we could not figure out what the problem might be, but our waiter seemed possibly to be having a personal problem, perhaps.  My dinner was tasty and fresh, but my husband's fish was dry.  We had arrived about 15 minutes early (a Saturday night) and waited in the bar for our friends, although our table was ready.  Bartender was pleasant and accommodating.  When we left at about 9, most of the tables were empty.  Under other circumstances, we would have complained to a manager, but we did not want to cast a worse shadow on an evening out with friends.   An email the next day to explain our less than satisfying experience has gone unanswered.  I felt I would try that before complaining publically.   We won't be going back."}
{"text":"The first time I have walked out of a restaurant.  We went to Fresco's on December 23, 2015 as they offered a special discount offer as a pre-Holiday promotion.  I was visiting from out of town and my parents told me that this place had some great food. When we arrived there was nobody waiting at the front. After about 10 minutes, a hostess appeared and showed us to our seats. We overheard the waitress tell the table behind us that she was the only waitress working that night. Strange, when the restaurant was offering a special offer and had quite a few customers. When the hostess walked passed our table, we asked if she could take our order. She told us that she \"wasn't a waitress\" and \"didn't know how to take orders\" - we were clearly frustrated and so she reluctantly went to find a notepad anyway.  After another 10 min, she came back to take our orders - and clearly had no idea of what was on the menu. This made us nervous but we were still optimistic. 45 min later and we still didn't have even a glass of water.  We noticed people coming in and the hostess telling them to leave. We then heard the waitress (that never waited on us) tell a table that the kitchen was \"on hold\" (whatever that means).  We finally got our waters after about 1 hour - but after an hour and 15 min with no food and no explanation or apology, we got up and just left VERY disappointed. And there was nobody there to even notice! Worst dining experience of my life. Avoid this place. Note to management, hire more employees or stop posting offers you can't fulfill.  I apparently can't give this restaurant zero stars. That's the only reason they are getting one."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in Fresco's. My wife and I made a reservation here and were excited to try it out, as we had heard positive things. When we arrived, we were starving and were told there would be a 45 minute wait to be seated and there was a hold on the kitchen. Seriously??? We made a reservation! And they didn't even have the courtesy to call and notify us! What a joke. Ruined date night and we were excited to see the band that was playing. It may have been slightly better had the person (manager? Hostess?) not been argumentative and told us it wasn't their fault and completely disregarded us making a reservation. Overall, a HUGE disappointment and we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Frescos is the true renaissance man (restaurant) of Wexford, not some one trick pony that many in this area cut themselves out to be.   Frescos offers one of the friendliest and most welcoming dining environments in the greater Pittsburgh area, and the new outdoor deck has further help establish that amicable ambiance. This expansive outdoor venue makes parties of all sizes feel comfortable, which is preferred for post- work drinks with friends.  But not only do I visit Frescos with large groups of coworkers, it's also the place I know I can enjoy an intimate dinner with family or a close friend. With weekly dinner and drink specials, there is never a dull meal served by their knowledgeable waiting staff.    I shared a few small plates which included: fresh goat cheese and bacon flatbread, the most delicious quinoa and garbanzo bean lettuce wraps, and for dessert, a half rack of ribs, smothered in finger-lickin-good in-house BBQ sauce. My palate was completely satiated, especially by the complexity of the house made BBQ sauce.   I highly recommend Frescos to anyone in search of an after work social bar scene, a family gathering or small intimate dinner. A true Wexford gem."}
{"text":"Four of us met at the outside patio for dinner and entertainment. The waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and answered our questions about particular wines. We ordered our meals and drinks. The drinks and food arrived quickly; that's good, but our waitress kept disappearing for 10-20 min; we ordered 2nd round of drinks; we never got them. The food was not good, and my bun was moldy. We had to track down our waitress and she took the moldy food and asked if I wanted it replaced. My answer was no; but would enjoy another drink, she forgot.  She brought our check without us requesting it. The bill still had the moldy food as a charge; she forgot.  She tried very hard, not enough servers? You need a new chef. It's a shame. The inside is decorated nicely and comfortable looking.  Hope they get it together soon."}
{"text":"So happened across this lovely place coming to see a friends band called Well Strung play the the patio.  We sat on the patio which was beautiful and the wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  We got water served to us right away with a carafe to refill our drinks when needed   The menu had a nice variety and they even had a little featured menu as well. I ordered the house made sangria, which was delicious but could of used more of a kick to it.  Then I ordered the Mahi Tacos . They were amazing! They were topped avocados and a wonderful mango pineapple salsa. Only thing about the dish I didn't like is the fish was over cooked and abbot dry. If it was cooked better the whole experience would of went up a level.  Now my boyfriend ordered the seafood bisque which I tasted. That was delicious   I really enjoyed the place can't wait to come back and try other things off the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I, and my sister and her husband, came to Frescos for Valentine's Day, 2015, and had a wonderful meal! Our server, Sarah was thorough, friendly, and very attentive to our needs. She was great! Our meal was delicious, and the dessert was great! Very reasonable cost, and excellent variety on the menu. Nice atmosphere, with nice music playing in the background. Highly recommended for a very nice evening out with your loved ones! Great job Frescos!!!!"}
{"text":"Awful service and the food is even worse! Don't waste your money or time... Trust me!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in the north Pittsburgh region in the ~6 months I've been calling the area home.  The Groupon I purchased was for $40 worth of food, Sunday-Thursday only.  When reviewing the online dinner menu I thought the sides that accompany the entr√©e dishes were a little boring, so my husband and I took a less conventional route and ordered a bunch of appetizers for dinner, tapas style.  Home run!  Here's a summary of what we ordered and thoroughly enjoyed:  * Campari Tomato Salad:  Nice fresh tomatoes, and using smoked mozzarella was a brilliant twist. * Italian Pork Meatballs:  Served in a nice broth with a big crostini.  Good stuff, but this is the one dish I could have done without. * Dip Duo with Pita Chips:  Artichoke dip was tasty and the hummus just so-so.  The pita chips arrived warm and nicely seasoned; they were amazing. * Buffalo Chicken Flatbread:  The buffalo flavor/heat was mild, which was great for me because I wouldn't have been able to enjoy this dish otherwise.  This flatbread was one of the daily specials, was delicious, and was a fantastic bang for the buck. * Goat Cheese Flatbread:  Same as above--delicious and a tremendous value.  Also killer?  The complimentary bread, olive oil, vinegar, and sundried tomato and olive mixture.  A way above average complimentary offering.  Now about that online dinner menu:   it's outdated!  Gotta keep your website up to speed, Frescos.  Mid-way through dinner I mentioned the inaccurate online menu to the waiter, and it was clear he'd heard that complaint before.  Our server Bill, incidentally, was incredible and was a wonderful promoter of the establishment and the kitchen staff.  Nice guy, pleasant and professional.  Liked that he wrote the leftover flatbread names on our styrofoam to-go container; I appreciate that kind of extra effort.  When my guy and I enjoyed the dinner described above the restaurant was totally dead.  I couldn't help but think, wow, everyone's missing some seriously solid food!  When we returned a few weeks later for the unfortunately mediocre Sunday brunch--we found buy-one-get-one-free coupons in our Entertainment coupon book--the restaurant was considerably fuller though.  I try to save 5-star reviews for the best of the best.  Frescos is almost 5 stars, almost."}
{"text":"I was disappointed big time.  A club I belong to attends a yearly celebration around February for our banquet. So i received a 20 dollar off coupon for the restaurant  We decided to go Wednesday 6/29/17 6:00 pm. There wasn't one person in the place. We sat for along time just to order appetizers. That was the only part of our meal that was good. The ribs were tuff as nails and the burgers over done. The fries under cooked, and the odd thing is, we were all alone with no server for very long periods of time. Like it took 30 minutes to get food, The server was poor at best. No wonder the place was empty..... I expected alot more from this establishment. I am sad for them."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last night with my fiance for dinner at around 7 PM.  Honestly I had never heard of Fresco's before last night and only stumbled upon it while looking through the 2014 Entertainment book but boy am I glad that I did!  It's location is probably part of its problem as even though I knew where it should have been (a little off of 19 in the Wexford Flats next to the Chadwick), I still had a little bit of a tough time finding it .  Whenever we finally arrived there were a lot of cars in the parking lot with no other businesses nearby so you can imagine my surprise whenever we walked into a completely empty restaurant.  I am not talking just of customers but there was no hostess, waiter or bartender either for the first 2 minutes that we were standing there.  I believe that there was a private party going on behind some closed doors which would have made sense of the cars.  Eventually our soon to be waiter came out and got the hostess for us who sat us in a booth in a warmer section of the restaurant.  The inside of this restaurant is actually pretty nice looking with hardwood floors, cool lighting and some playful decorations. They also had an outdoor seating area which looked like it could be amazing in the summer although it was not nearly as inviting covered in a couple inches of snow.  My fiance let me know that she saw that they have live music sometimes and I imagine that if that is true combined with the outdoor seating then this place would be amazing.  For our dinners we decided to start of the evening by splitting the Garlic Parmesan fries that came with cracked pepper and basil aioli.  Before our fries came out we were given some some bread, a nice rustic loaf, as well as some olive oil dipping sauce that had some spices and sun dried tomatoes in it.  It was all pretty good and I got that first bite taste of olive oil which I often associate with better oils.  Whenever the fries came out I have to admit that I wasn't too excited by the looks of them as they were glistening a bit, almost like they were too greasy.  However the first taste immediately put that thought to rest as the fries were somewhat crispy and when combined with the browned garlic pieces and strings of melted Parmesan, they were awesome.  The aoili for them was also pretty good although it was not what I expected. The basil for it ended up being some bigger bits of basil leaf and while it was nicely mixed it, I would have thought that it would had been better integrated.  After the appetizer I was now eagerly looking forward to my dinner entree which was the braised beef pot roast with white cheddar mac 'n cheese and caramelized brussel sprouts.  It was also supposed to come with a red wine tomato demi but since red wine gives me migraines, I opted out of that.  After hearing my reasoning the waiter asked if I would like some of the Hunter sauce that is normally served with the meatloaf on the side and I quickly agreed to it.  I should probably note here that the waiter was excellent all evening for us.  He was patient with us without being pushy and seemed to be very accommodating.  My dinner ended up being excellent.  The pot roast was super tender as well as being moist which I was impressed with seeing how it came out dry without its usual sauce.  The hunters sauce was also nice and at first taste I thought the front tasted a little like ketchup but then at the end there was a distinct steak sauce flavor.  My brussel sprouts were also really good as they were halved and then caramelized as promised with a nice little flavoring or butter although not too much to overpower the flavor of the sprout.  Finally the Mac N Cheese was good although it may have been my least favorite part of my plate (not that it was bad by any means) which if you know me says a lot about the rest of my food.  My finance had the blackened swordfish for dinner and let me know that it was perfectly cooked.  She also got a small little arugula salad on the plate which I thought was great since it had pickled onions in it.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future, hopefully soon!  It is not often that I love everything that I had for my meal but Fresco's did that for me last night.  Now if I can only wait until its a bit warmer so that I can try out some of their outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I went here with my now fiance for their Sunday brunch special which runs from 10:30-2:00 PM.  It sits back off of route 19 next to Chadwick and can be a little tricky to find.  Walking in you are met with a some beautiful classy decorations that give it a very modern feel.  I felt a little out of place wearing jeans as a majority of people there were not wearing them.  We were seated quickly and got to dig into the buffet.  They had a very diverse buffet set up.  Initially on the one side you had your traditional breakfast items: scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, french toast, orange juice, and cranberry juice.  Then as you moved around you were introduced to a Greek salad, a very interesting combination of feta cheese and watermelon, and then you got into the lunch/dinners.  They had pork chops with a tomato dressing on top, some type of lamb and vegetables, a Greek chicken combination, and some absolutely fantastic breaded cod! I also tried some sides of red potatoes and penne pasta.  To top off the meal, there was dessert of which I had the chocolate and vanilla cheesecake (really terrific).    What a great selection for a Sunday brunch buffet.  You feel like you really get your money's worth in food when you go here.  The waitress was a little distracted at times and didn't come that often to collect plates or refill waters, but other than that it was a fantastic choice! I'm interested in trying this place out for dinner next time."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night with another couple. It was a good choice, it was almost empty, so we could hear one another speak. I had the bistro stack, which was prepared properly, tender beef, good crab meat cake. My wife's pork dish was good, large portion so having it today as well. Terrific attentive service! Beautiful outdoor patio was empty on a nice evening. Can't explain it."}
{"text":"Frescos advertises a Thanksgiving ready to go catered menu that customers have until Monday, Nov 20th 2017 to order. Well, I called Sunday Nov. 19th to place my order for $175 for 8-12 people. I was informed it was SOLD OUT even though the website still advertises it as available and there is no mention of a limited quantity. I asked the woman on the phone if there was anyway an order could be placed since it is still BOLDY advertised that orders were accepted until Nov 20th and was told no. I have ordered this before and was quite pleased....well obviously I will NEVER order from Frescos or eat there again. I am left in quite a quandary with family coming for Thanksgiving Thursday.  Thanks Frescos."}
{"text":"They really do a great job with their Sunday buffet. Starts at 10 AM which is earlier than a lot of them. Each dish is well-prepared, for example, the chicken has not just the regular mushrooms that you would expect in the chicken dish but also a lot of the fancy mushrooms make this dish stand out. The bacon is crispy, breakfast foods are good and lots and lots of desserts.   One of the best parts of the meal was the tilapia. It had a sweet and spicy sauce it really was great. Mashed potatoes tasted homemade and there were surprises on all different parts of the buffet.   It is worth mentioning the whole buffet including breakfast, lunch and dessert items was only 14.95. Everyone here is friendly from the hostess to the waitress to the chef. Very nice Sunday meal."}
