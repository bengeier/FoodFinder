{"text":"Ordered a Groupon and decided to use it here today.  The place is great!  I ordered the Seoul Patrol sandwich which is korean bbq beef, kimchi and, I think, green onion.   Fantastic.  Spicy and fresh.  The fries were also fried to a crispy perfection.   My wife had the fish tacos and really enjoyed them.

They appear to have 30 or so beers on tap.  At least on this Sunday,  all of the taps were 2 for 1.  I am not sure if this is the normal happy hour.  I very much recommend stopping by for a beer and a sandwich."}
{"text":"About a year over due review- Decent place with a good atmosphere, however service was incredible rude on my visit. Would go back but avoid if possible, as it gave me a bas first impression."}
{"text":"I normally don't like gimmicks, and the side door entrance of this bar/restaurant didn't help out. However, I really like this place. Beer is cheap (make sure to get the $5 pitcher of the \"now\" beer), and the food comes in generous portions. My friends and I got one of the flatbreads, a burger, and the fish tacos.

If you are looking for a casual spot, this place has ample space for medium-size parties, and it also has delicious food to boot. The burgers are cooked well, and the fries are crispy, thin, and satisfying. The flatbread isn't the best I've had, but it's above average. Like I said earlier, the portions are quite large, so you don't need to worry about that. 

The list of beers is quite long and impressive. They offer much more than the typical Wisconsin beer selection (Dogfish head, New Belgium, etc), and the ambiance is great. They have a dart board in one corner (along with a karaoke machine or music machine of some sort), and it looks like a place that you can establish as your regular spot. The pictures of side doors on the wall was a little much to me, but it doesn't detract from the experience at all.

My friends and I will definitely come back, whether it be for drinks or food."}
{"text":"The food and the service are outstanding!  This place is hard to find but very much worth the effort.  We had a grilled chicken wrap filled with fresh ingredients including lots of yummy spinach!  Also had volcano tots, pretty good and we saw other cheesy, sour cream, steaming hot tots at other tables that looked outstanding!!"}
{"text":"On point for price to food ratio, flavor, and service.
I ordered the \"Seoul Patrol\" which is succulent Asian BBQ on a bun, just bursting with wonderful flavors. 
The baked tater tots app was a heaping portion.
Great service, but we went during lunch and there was only one other customer.
Will have to visit again to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing tater tots, great beer list -differ micro brews and all only$4.  Server Aaron was also great.  Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"We went in during happy hour mid-week, following other reviewer suggestions to avoid the crowds. It was quiet and clean. The waiter/bartender was very friendly from the moment we opened the door, and stayed as attentive as needed. 

We tried the tots as suggested and we were not disappointed. Best tots ever!

We also shared a burger -which was cooked to med perfection. Great place when you crave bar food that isn't exceptionally greasy. The happy hour deals sounded good, but we were fine with water that day."}
{"text":"Only reason this isn't 5 stars is the service. Wasn't terrible but our waitress didn't check on us much after the food came out and had to be flagged down for beers.
I'd come back for the beer list alone. Wonderful selection on tap; I especially enjoyed the Batshit Crazy. The churrasco flatbread was fantastic! Loaded with toppings and very flavorful. I'd like to come back sometime."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Their tap beer selection was amazing!  I loved the atmosphere and ambiance. This is a great place to spend an evening!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They have 33 beers on tap. 33....THIRTY THREE BEERS. And they're all microbrews. This is how a Wisconsin bar should do beer. The food menu is decently sized and the portions are pretty good. Prices are a little higher, but like I said, good portions. They have gluten free pizza which my wife says is amazing, so that's always a plus. The bartender is friendly and quick with orders and willing to talk if you want to. They're never really busy, which I like. I like to sit, enjoy a beer or five and enjoy not trying to hear myself think. If you want a packed place full of talk and excitement, hit a club, not tap room. I could say this place has a cozy feel, kind of like Cheers, but without the history. I hope they're here for a long time to come."}
{"text":"Great burger! Oh my goodness! One of the best I have had in Madison!
I got it delivered,  it was fast and hot!
Great place I will go again!"}
{"text":"Great place. Friendly service with smart bartenders. Excellent beer selection and great priced. The tator tots were fantastic."}
{"text":"Been here at least a dozen times and it has always been a great experience. Perfect for a quick lunch or a bite before heading downtown or to the Union. Excellent location with ample parking. Service is good and while the menu is short, there is a variety. The Seoul Patrol is phenomenal and the Side Door and Sunset Burger are also quite nice. But, the massive Tater Tots are the best I've ever had. The Volcano Tots on the other hand is too spicy - I can handle heat, but it had too much of a kick. It is a great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Had it not been for the Groupon, I wouldn't have known of this restaurant. My bf and I ordered the South of the Border Tots as an app, which were delicious! Thanks to Yelp for the suggestion and photo.  

My bf ordered the Sunset Burger... Delicious and a bit messy, which is one of the factors I use to rate my burgers btw. Just messy enough (but not too messy) is a gold star.  The buns soaked up the burger juices while still maintaining it's form.  I ordered the Seoul Patrol sandwich, which had Korean BBQ and Kimchee on it. It was tasty (and I am a huge fan of Korean food), but I would've preferred more slices of Korean BBQ and Kimchee. Lots of beer options on the menu. I ate mine with Goose Island's 312 Wheat Ale.  Not your typical bar food... definitely a couple steps up. (see pic with meh lighting)

Staff was accommodating. Nice comfortable area below Samba Brazilian restaurant. Probably owned by the same business since my debit card transaction showed as Samba instead of The Side Door Grill and Tap. I'll be back for more food for sure!"}
{"text":"Had a groupon, so I thought why not?  My husband and I ordered the southwestern tater tots to split.  We LOVED the citrus sour cream on it as well as the underlying taste of the tater tots themselves.  Definitely excellent.  We each ordered a beer on special for happy hour, in the bottle.  Each were only a couple of dollars and very good.  They had a very decent beer list.  As we often do, we ended up getting the same main course, the sunset burger.  It was served on a ciabatta roll and the burger itself had that chargrilled flavor, but could have used salt in my opinion (easily remedied).  I liked the guac served on it along with the bacon jam.  The egg on top is typically over hard, but I ordered mine over easy, and they did a perfect job of leaving the yolk soft but not too runny.  Very good burger.  I got the salad side with it, my hubby the fries.  Fries were spiced and battered, he was a fan.  The side salad was basic mixed greens, good amount, and the sundried tomato dressing was great.  Overall a very good meal for the price.  The service was not the best, but fine.  We will definitely go back.  Excellent deal with the groupon, but good prices even without. They had an all you can eat fish taco special and an all you can eat fried fish special tonight for around ten bucks and we saw they do a Wednesday all you can eat pizza deal for $11.  If you are really hungry, worth checking out for sure.   Nice place for a casual meal and drinks."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, although the sports were a little loud. The burgers are good. I was impressed with the ciabatta bread instead of the traditional hamburger buns. What an exotic twist. 

The ordering system made me uncomfortable. I wasn't sure whether we would get a waiter or whether we should order at the bar. 

Nevertheless, good place to grab a burger and a drink."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure what to say that hasn't been said already, but i will say that it definitely doesn't hurt to follow the majority.  Many yelpers have recommended the tater tots and the seoul patrol, so that's what I did.  I went with a bunch of friends and we ordered the volcano tots and the potater tots to share.  Both were really delicious.  The tater tots were nice, soft, and potato-ey on the inside, and crispy on the outside, and both portions had a great helping of sauce (AKA sour cream + condiments) so the tater tots ended up being really flavorful.  Warning: the tater tots portion is quite big, could almost be a full meal, so I'd recommend sharing.  The seoul patrol was also great.  The sauce was delicious, the meats were well cooked (tender and juicy), and the bread was nice and soft.  The fries that come with it are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  They're also on the thin side.  I asked for barbecue sauce because I'm not the biggest fan of ketchup, and it was well worth it! There's a special \"kick\" in their barbecue sauce that most other barbecue sauces don't have.  The waitress was also really nice in accommodating all 7 of us, helping us get enough plates, refill our water, split our check, and get us (mainly me haha) extra barbecue sauce when we (me) ran out."}
{"text":"Long lists of rotating local beers on tap. 

All you can eat fish tacos or fish fry on Fridays. 

We came with our Groupon deal,  ordered two beers and one of each of the all you can eat fish and our tab before to was $12!

The fried tilapia in the fish tacos were decent,  the undressed red cabbage slaw took away from the rest of the tacos. It arrived with black beans and white rice - of which are not refillable. 

The fried cod was a winner,  with a slightly salty batter crisp enough to hold through the tartar sauce. 

The service is flighty. We asked for no sour cream on the tacos and received them. Our companion ordered the AYCE fish fry and got the tacos. But was otherwise sufficient. No real identity or ambiance as it's located under the Samba Grill and has a basement feel.

I won't come back here again without a Groupon."}
{"text":"We usually come to Side Door when we are downtown.  They have a small parking lot.  It's a clean bar with clean bathrooms.  Lots of college students but it's always chill (at least between 3 and 7PM).  Good happy hour, great beer selection, good food.  I recommend it!"}
{"text":"I understand that they have a new manager.  Seems like an energetic individual.  The food was very good and was served quickly. I would give it a try."}
{"text":"We visited on July 2nd at around 7:45pm.  The place was empty, 1 guy at the bar - who might have worked there or been a friend of the girl working - and a table of 6 or so sitting outside.  Wife and I were the only people inside, sitting at the bar.  Server/bartender comes in from outside about 5 mins after we arrive. She goes behind the bar, walks right past us to get drinks for the people outside and leaves - does say a word, make eye contact, nothing.  Another 5 minutes go by with no one from Side Door seen.  Another customer walks in and stands next to me at the bar.  The same server/bartender comes back in and takes an order from the person standing next to me, gets their drinks and leaves the bar area again completely ignoring us for a second time.  We had had enough and walked out.  I have never encountered a situation like that before, it was a terrible customer experience.  It was very disappointing considering we chose this place based on its 4 star Yelp reviews.  I can't see myself giving this place a 2nd chance after what happened."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Had the Korean Tacos. The meat was braised beef and was nicely cooked. The cabbage, pepper, and carrots were sliced beautifully thin and worked well.  The fired wonton strips and sesame seeds were nice touches.  All the toppings especially worked well in the black beans and rice.  The only problem which is my biggest problem is they weren't Korean. They had a soy and bbq reduction sauce they used to pour in the tacos. No bulgogi flavors at all and since pouring sauce on tacos the flavor didn't really permeate the meat.  At best I would call these asianesque.  Other than that it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Fantastic portion sizes.  Burgers and fries might quietly be the best in the area.  Little tricky to find, which means I have never seen it become uncomfortably loud or crowded.  Plenty of televisions.  Surprisingly great chocolate cheesecake."}
{"text":"What can I say! I am definitely a fan! Now, don't let the name of the restaurant cause you to miss it because the entrance really is at the Side Door! 

Let's start with our waiter, Aaron. He greeted us and brought water in a timely fashion. That is always a plus when you are part of a large group like we were. We were a group of about 10. Now, our of our group arrived before we did so their food came out  a lot sooner. This was cool because this allowed us to browse the menu a little longer and review the list of extensive beers that they have. OMG! I almost felt like I was at the Firkin Fest because there was such a variety of beers from different breweries. 

So since I am a beer fan and enjoy trying new beers, I asked Aaron for some recommendations based on my preference of Wheat Style Beers. He recommended Mosquito Beach by Lake Louie (sp?).  It was delicious! It had a very unique taste. Let me try to describe it. It was very smooth (and not bitter), but at the end had a mild hoppy flavor, but it was very crisp in that that hoppy flavor did not last long on your tongue. Now, that's the best that I can do, but it is definitely worth a try. 

Okay, now the food. Our group probably ordered everything on the menu and let's just say, we were not disappointed by anything we ate. Each dish was served pipping hot, had unique flavors, and was delicious in every way. So, we could not resist sharing our food with everyone in our group. I am going to try and remember what foods we tried: Side Door Burger (which came with Brew City Beer Battered Fries), Fish Tacos, Mac n Cheese, Tater Tots, Beer and Cheeseburger Soup. And I almost forgot that we tried the beer, Mob Craft Batshit Crazy. It was an English Brown Ale brewed with milk sugar to add a balanced creamy sweetness, and flavored with a delicious blend of Nicaraguan and Ugandan Coffees from Just Coffee Co-op that exhibit slight characteristics of cherry, tobacco, and brown sugar. Now that was the description from the restaurant and I cannot describe it, but it was delicious. It was not your ordinary brown ale. 

After dinner, I had the opportunity to chat with Aaron for a few minutes. He informed me that this restaurant used to be the Cabana Room and has only been open for about 18 months. Did you know that the recipe for the Fish Tacos was an original recipe from the Cabana Room? Now, that's cool especially for those that miss the Cabana Room. Now they have something to entice them to try out this place! 

As a side note, Aaron also recommended that we try out the Lemon Drop Martini at the Comedy Club on State Street. Sounds like Aaron knows a little something about beers and spirits! Oh and I almost forgot to mention the most important thing, all of the beers on tap are just $4/glass! How awesome is that!"}
{"text":"I hosted a private event at The Side Door and it was an overall great experience.  The general manager was a friendly, professional guy who was great to deal with. 

The menu has some pretty solid pub fare on it, including some good flatbread pizzas and unique wings (large drumsticks). 

I recommend this as a great place to stop in for a drink and a quick bite prior to a downtown event."}
{"text":"Wow $4 beer, every beer and most of them are very good beers. I'm used to seeing PBR for $4, but every microbrew is amazing. The burgers are huge and good, but not the greatest burgers out there. However the $4 beers are so you won't  know the difference by the time you leave."}
{"text":"another favorite restaurant found! Tasty prepared food, in amazing price. It is open at the side door so hard to find, and they only got one waitress. But really good place to eat with friends or even eat alone, enjoy delicious food!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had, and I am a burger snob. Perfectly cooked, juicy, delicious bun that was not to big for the burger. My friend LOVED the cheese sauce, great beer selections. Wish I lived close but my hips are glad I don't."}
{"text":"Cool place, The entrance is poorly advertised in a way that makes you feel adventurous. Once you find it and get in, its a pretty nice place - Definitely a bar, but everything seemed clean and well cared-for.

The food was pretty good and the serving sizes were generous. A BBQ Chicken Flatbread and a Side of Fries was enough to feed me (right after having lifted weights) and my girlfriend (who admittedly wasn't that hungry to begin with,) then leave a fifth of the meal for our leftover box. Good decision tonight. Our thanks to the Side Do'."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow, but they at least recognized and apologized, which always goes a long way. Good selection of craft beers and I liked that you could choose smaller or larger pours. Great burgers."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, baked potatoe tater tots are huge and taste yummy! The burgers were great the bacon was a little uner cooked for me so ask for it well done if you like it crispy. $4 craft beers with a big selection. The server was nice and tentative without  being pesty. Good value for your dollar.  Definitely a good stop while in Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Was there recently on a Friday night.  I still like this place.  It has many, many, many great taps.  I wouldn't suggest ordering the all you can eat fish tacos.  It's not that they were bad, but they weren't memorable."}
{"text":"Oh my...we stopped in for drinks and appetizers.  Things were not good. We ordered the Loaded Baked Potato tots. The first bite gave a zing of citrus. It was not pleasant. It was probably the equivalent of eating gummy cardboard spritzed with lemon. Not sure why but they were completely void of any taste resembling a tater tot. The chicken nachos were not terrible but sour cream that you can pour??  I would label it a ranch disguised as sour cream.  Good beers though."}
{"text":"Churrasco flatbread, truly interesting selection of beers. My kimchee beef sandwich wasn't great, but the burgers, fries, salads were all terrific -- and reasonable."}
{"text":"Have been to the side door several times and it never disappoints. Lots of great midwest beer on tap not to mention amazing beer specials. Also really delicious bar appetizers such as soft pretzels! Usually go on the weekend during the afternoon and it has never been to busy. A must stop if you are walking around state street."}
{"text":"This is easily in my top 3 places to hit up in Madison. The bartenders are always super friendly, most of them know the beers on tap backwards and forwards, and they're willing to give you a taste before you commit to a full pint. 
The happy hour deals are unbeatable- 2-for-1 beers every single day (even weekends), and all beers are $4 a pop every day. They only serve one pitcher at a time (from one tap), so you can't usually just get any beer in a pitcher form, but when a tap does go onto \"Pitcher of the now,\" the deal is great. 
I've never had bad food here, either. The Mac is obscenely good (so good that I can't stop eating it, even when I'm stuffed), tots are a must. Basically, all appetizers are good, burgers are yummy. 
Make sure to get a side of queso with your French fries. 
I can't say any bad things about this place. 
Go and make it your regular stop."}
{"text":"I love this place, have been going here for years. But tonight must have been a off night. It was kinda busy, I waited for a menu and I literally sat for over 10 mins before I had to up to the bar and order. Two servers walked by me a dozen times without even asking if I needed a menu or anything. I'm not trying to a asshole but do better."}
{"text":"After the reviews on yelp, I decided to try it. The Seoul sandwich with fries was amazing. The beer the bartender, Joel, suggested was great, even the second beer I had that was also suggested. Very friendly people at the bar to talk to. I am very impressed and would like to come back if I'm still in town  otherwise if I come back."}
{"text":"Great delivery in reasonable time. Ordered here just out of curiosity and was very pleasantly surprised. The food was good quality and arrived in nice containers, with good presentation. The bacon burger, cheese cubes and tater tots were all great. Did not come with silverware in the bag so be sure to keep that in mind. A great experience overall, will definitely order again or stop by. Kinda feeling like I need to go here in person now."}
{"text":"The receptionist at my Hotel recommended The Side Door. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. My friend and I ordered their burgers, fries and a tipsy cow beer. Everything was outstanding! The burgers were delicious and cooked perfectly! The fries were crispy and golden brown. We were extremely happy with our meal!"}
{"text":"We stopped in herefor the 1st time to see what they carried for craft beers.  Man am I glad we did.  They had a wonderful selection of craft beers.  All types of local choices or many from.all over the map.  So we had to sample several. After drinking for awhile it was now time to eat. So we decided to look over the food menu which was a smaller more limited on choices.  However the bartendar offerd some reccomendation that we each went with.  Fabulous fish tacos with beans and rice.  I will be back just for those alone. 
 I tried so many awesome craft beers this day, I dont even remember what to say about that topic.  Other than if you are looking to try something new or unique stop in the side door for a cool laid back experience!  Friendly staff, friendly patrons, chill little spot.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"A friend saw a deal for Side Door on Groupon, so we figured that we'd check it out. The place was pretty empty, and we were seated right away. The inside was kind of generic looking, and the decor wasn't great. It's the kind of place you'd go with a group of friends to enjoy some beers and burgers.

The menu had typical pub food and a pretty extensive beer selection. I split the BBQ chicken flatbread and the Side Door burger with a friend and it was way too much food! I think we would have been fine sharing just one entree. The burger was delicious, and the fries were well seasoned and crispy. The BBQ chicken flatbread was good but had a lot going on. 

The prices were fair, even without the Groupon. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food is good. But when you order for delivery. DONT ADD ANYTHING EXTRA.  Like extra meat, cheese sauce, anything. They RIP YOU OFF! I'm not even  exaggerating. I've ordered the cheese sauce three times now and each time they only filled the container about a quarter of the way full. But charge 3 dollars extra. The meat too.  I ordered chicken on my nachos and there was barely any chicken. Again 3 more dollars. I EVEN asked for more cheese in a nice way and still got shorted.  So if you enjoy being ripped off add extras."}
{"text":"Total hidden gem!!! 

4.5 stars really

Fantastic beer selection. Feels more like a pub than a bar. Waitstaff (who both visits doubled as the bartender) was extremely friendly and personable. 

The homemade tots are worth the trip alone and easily get a five star rating. We had the loaded baked potato tots which were so amazing we came back three days later to have someone else eat them. Now, these are no ordinary tots. Homemade with real potatoes and 2-3 times a regular tot (bigger than a large marshmallow). They are in a garlic sauce that is so outstanding my sister used her rarely used \"I could take a bath in that\" phrase of approval. There is also very high-quality bacon bits on top as well as cheddar and a light drizzle of sour cream. Delicious doesn't even begin to describe this dish. My mom has already planned for two more trips FROM CHICAGO just to eat these. Trust me, you want these tots. 

On to the burger. We had the one with bacon, cheddar, mushrooms and onion straws. Asked for the mustard and aioli on the side. The first time we had this they overcooked the burger, we asked for medium and it was well done. The second time it was cooked to medium perfectly. Both times you could tell the beef was fresh and high quality. Excellent taste. It is served on a ciabatta which normally I don't like but this worked. 

My mom had the side salad. She was pleasantly surprised by the amount of veggies and the freshness. The portion of greens was generous and was accompanied by a large amount of tomatoes, cucumbers and nicely shaved carrot curls. Everything was fresh and vibrant. She was a huge fan of the honey balsamic dressing. 

The space is a little small and unassuming. It was very clean. There are a few TVs to watch sports too."}
{"text":"My friend and i had a Groupon deal and decided to try this place out.  The place was empty when we walked in and nothing too special about it.  However,  the beer selection was very extensive. We both had the grilled before sandwich.  Good portion and great food. Service was friendly and prices were reasonable.  Outdoor seating is available as well."}
{"text":"Weird...that's how I'd describe this place.

Went there on a Sunday night to grab a beer--it was empty. The bar has a very \"diner\"-ish feel to it. Whoever designed this place honestly wasn't really trying--it feels thrown together, almost like a mall food court.

Anyways, I didn't eat anything, but the ambiance is pretty awful. Beer selection, though? Excellent. Well, except for Bedlam, which the bartender was surprised to find they were out of! I had a Deviant Dales. It was great!

Now, whenever I check out a new bar, I like to test the bartender's knowledge. I did, and I thought it was lacking--questions about hoppiness or certain flavors were met with blank stares. No worries, dude--I know what I'm doing.

So, in short, here's how I see it: If you have a group of friends and like good beer, go here. They've got a great tap selection. Just don't expect anything in the way of atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is a ton of fun for food/drinks with friends or a quick bite to eat solo! Kind of an industry bar in Madison, it's located right below Samba right off of State Street, but its a relatively well kept secret from the \"masses\" and as such enjoys kind of a down low atmosphere (most students will not be able to tell you where or what the Side Door is).

One of the coolest places about this place is they share a kitchen with Samba (above) which is more of an upscale restaurant, so all of their food is super good. I highly recommend the Korean BBQ Tacos when they have them on the menu (comes with beans and rice), I have actually eaten 3 full orders before.

If you are industry, bring in your pay stub for 2 for 1 deals. 

Lots of darts being played here!"}
{"text":"Korean beef tacos?beef? Nice. Kimchi?Nice. Black beans? Nice! Eating Outside? Nice! Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is very good! Love the Tator Tott concept and they are amazing. This place will never succeed based on the management accepting horrible service. We were in on Sat 12/7 around 1pm  and the \"young lady\" that was working was absolutely horrible and doesn't have a clue about customer service. We were at the bar for 1 1/2 hours to split  burger and only had one beer due to her NEVER coming back to ask!  She dropped our food  she never brought us silverware or napkins and i had to ask for silver wear after 5 minutes.The other 5 kids at the bar asked for water 3 times and never got it! Then they when they ordered soup she brought the wrong kind and when they addressed it she had the nerve to argue about it and say they ordered wrong kind of soup when i heard them order!  What in the world! What kind of waitress argues about what someone ordered! SHE seriously said THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID! The poor kid was like yes i did and i heard him the first time and she continued to argue with him! I personally saw 3 tables leave because of the service and heard several other tables commenting on the lack of her service. Then to send me over the edge a table came to the bar because she never went out to wait on them - they ordered a kiddy cocktail and she grabbed a huge jar of cherries and proceeded to shove up her sweater sleeve and dig her nasty dirty hand into the jar and toss the cherries into the kids drink! If they settle on this horrible service they will be gone in 3 months regardless of the great food!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little place off of State.  I first went here during Madison's craft beer week since they had some tap takeovers.  The beer selection is good, and you can usually find some unique options (plus they are all $4 and for $8 they have a \"pitcher-of-the-meow\").  I've only eaten here once, but I have no complaints (I ordered a Mediterranean-style burger).  The bartenders and servers were friendly and the food arrived promptly.  

This place almost has a townie kind of vibe to it and it's never been crowded."}
{"text":"So yummy. It is a regular spot that my family and I hit up. You have to try the tots!"}
{"text":"Always a chill place to come have a craft beer, and even a nice meal too.

There's about 32 beers on tap at a given time and the bartenders are helpful when it comes to samples or suggestions. Whenever I can't make up my mind, the bartenders always have something good in mind.

The prices for the beer are good compared to other places, $4 for a craft tap and 2 for $4 during their happy hour. They make good cocktails too, not just mixers.

In terms of a college bar, the Sidedoor is off the beaten path where you can come with friends and have a conversation without having to yell over blaring music. Not lame by any means though!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat in Madison! I love the atmosphere and the food is amazing! 
Try the mushroom burger, Its my favorite dish on the menu!  You will not be sorry!"}
{"text":"Side Door is an as-yet undiscovered gem, which is both good and bad.

Good because it's never overcrowded or overwhelmingly loud; you can almost always sit where you want; they're big into promotional events; and the staff is super-attentive and friendly. Our group of friends have all become regulars.

Bad because, well, we're afraid they won't survive in the long term! They're situated beneath a high-profile Brazilian grill, and you do more or less go in the side door, so they don't have a storefront the way nearly every other bar in Madison has. They're new, and many of Madison's bars are institutions, making exploratory bar seeking pretty rare. You really have to stumble upon it to find it, unless you're on a site like this.

Here's what I can say. Their menu is full of delicious surprises, both old-school and super innovative. Almost nothing comes without at least some sort of creative twist. Their various tots appetizers are just ridiculously good, and they have an enormous, ever-changing tap list with lots variety and descriptions of every single brew. And almost everything is delicious.

Only thing I'd change (besides their business volume)? They don't really play the bar angle as hard as they could. The dining room is always pretty well-lit, and the music, while quiet enough for easy conversation, could be a bit louder to set the mood without being disruptive. If they'd just add a little sense of intrigue to the place it'd really earn that last star.

Help keep 'em alive! Go to Side Door!"}
{"text":"Not sure how they were able to toast the pecans so perfectly on the Poached Pear Salad! It was as if delicious fine gems were dropped onto the salad from atop Mt. Olympus itself. Meanwhile, the greens were fresh and the chicken was seasoned to perfection. Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"One of Madison's bar scene's best kept secrets! Such a cute place, nice atmosphere, nice tap selections. I cannot attest to their food because I haven't had it but I hear their tater tots are really great."}
{"text":"Supremely disappointed, Side Door is a cool neighborhood type place that friends recommended. It is very cool on the inside, great beer selection and a fun vibe. The disappointment comes first from the service, very slow, I get that you are busy but have enough staff there or at least be polite and tell us there will be a wait instead of being snarky. I was also really disappointed in the food, we ordered a bunch of stuff to share, the spice rubbed wings were so salty we couldn't eat them, had to peel the breeding off and even then the salt was over powering. The baked tatertots, which they are apparently known for were greasy and the cheese sauce was watery.  What was good was the Mahgarita pizza, they put cilantro on it so it has a great fresh kick, if only it had been hot.  Sadly I won't go back or recommend."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  The atmosphere was very comfortable and not a bit overwhelming.  They have so many beers on tap but I of course had to order Bells Hopslam.  The bacon cheeseburger soup was delicious as was the pulled pork and fish tacos."}
{"text":"At my first visit to this restaurant, my group was told to seat ourselves outside, after which we waited for 15 minutes without so much as a hello from a waiter or waitress. We decided to leave rather than continue to wait. Not even a water was brought to the table."}
{"text":"We purchased a Groupon for this restaurant without knowing much and about it, and we were pleasantly surprised. It undoubtedly lives up to all the good reviews. Both our server and bartender were friendly and accommodating. The beer selection was really awesome, and the food was GREAT. I had the Asian chicken salad and my boyfriend had the burger. Both were delicious. This place can be a little hard to spot if you're not looking close enough (true to the name, you enter through the side door of the building). 

If we lived in Madison, this would definitely be a spot we would frequent. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. The tots cannot be described by review or photo. I've had several other items on the menu and nothing has disappointed yet. Sometimes wish the beer menu had a few other varieties but still pretty solid. I have had some less than favorable service but nothing to keep me from coming back.

It can be hard to find if you haven't been here like everyone says, but I just walk up the side (hence the name) by the patio walk in and grab a seat."}
{"text":"If you build it, they will come.  This may have worked for Field of Dreams, not so much for the Do It Yourself Bloody Mary bar at the Side Door.  We happened to wander in after learning about the 1 hour+ wait at a nearby brunch hotspot (pure definition of first world problems).  The place was empty but with happy hour 2:1 on rail drinks, bloodies, and tap beer, we were in no hurry to leave.  They have an impressive tap beer selection and while the tomato juice for the DIY bloody marys was a tad sweet, the \"add-ins\" were top notch. Speaking of top notch, the homemade tater tots were incredible.  Larger than the typical tot, the tater tot was the perfect mixture of crispy outside and soft inside.  I would come back just for them."}
{"text":"Side door was a pleasant surprise, once I was able to find the door,predictably on the side of the building! A lack of signage, leant an air of mystery, like the Safe House, spy-themed bar in Milwaukee. Once your find it, you walk down a set of stairs into a classic old \"wooden\" bar with a large dining area..

At lunchtime on a Saturday, it was not too crowded. I took a seat at the bar quite easily. The daily specials sign offered Korean Tacos, so I knew I was not in a bar with a predictable bar menu. The bartender was helpful in making my choices. She recommended the French Dip sandwich, emphasizing the house-made sliced sirloin and french bread. The tater tots here are special-they are hardly \"tot\" size, and more similar to what the French refer to as \"Quenelle.,\" More like tater adolescents. Chef Shane who popped out of the kitchen discussed the recipe, using roasted garlic mashed potatoes. They are deep-fried crispy on the outside, and creamy pleasant on the inside.I had the plain ones. There are four other tot orders which are available with special toppings. After narrowing my choice to the tacos, a swiss mushroom burger, and the French Dip, I went with the bartender's recommendation.

The French Dip was rich and flavorful and the perfect portion of meat and soft, sweet French bread. The au jus was not highly seasoned and it worked well with the sandwich. As stated, II chose the tots upgrade instead of fries. My inner carb freak cleaned this plate with no leftovers, no doggie bag. Lunch with beer around $16.00. Sweet.

I washed down my toothsome lunch with a Bell's Two-Hearted Ale. I like that the beer menu is limited, of sorts, to 30 different drafts, and the barkeep give you a nice list the minute you sit down. No need to squint at a chalkboard or eyeball all the tap handles. Service here was genuinely friendly, and included in my case, some chatty interaction with the chef and sous chef, who emerged from the kitchen for beverages and conversation.

So I found the side door (eventually) to be a very laid back and casual scene with a thoughtful and creative, though at the same time standard, bar menu. Think good burgers and sandwiches and those special tots. Chef Shane recommends his Friday Clam Chowder, too. Ieft very sated through the front door, which is also the entrance for the other restaurant in the building, Los Gemelos. If there's a back door, I still need to find it."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon for here and was pretty excited about it. Two choices of wines (a house red and house Chardonnay. No thank you. I know I'm in Wisconsin but I like a littttttlllle more options in the way of wine). Beer list was plentiful and I didn't end up thirsty so no worries there.
I ordered the warm pear salad and was really happy with it, very delicious. However...

My fiance ordered The Churrasco flatbread pizza. Described as per the menu: grilled flank steak sliced and served with chimichurri, mushrooms, caramelized onions and piquillo peppers. He HATES cilantro, like absolutely can't stand it. Turns out the chimichurri sauce is made with a ton of cilantro. Understandable, however, it didn't say so on the menu and chimichurri sauce is sometimes made with cilantro, but no traditionally. The cilantro was strong on this and included as seasoning on top. He politely told the waitress that he was sorry, and if it was listed on the menu he would gladly keep it but asked to ordered the baked mac and cheese instead. After the waitress argued with him saying that cilantro was \"what makes it green\". She snatched the plate up, said \"ooooook\", and gave a heavy sigh.
Bummer.
Baked mac and cheese was great. Felt irritated about the service especially because I don't feel like we were being rude or unreasonable. The place was nearly empty, too, btw. I don't mind when a server is having a bad day but we apologized twice about sending it back and received nothing from her.
Sad to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"One of my friends was in town for work and we decided to meet up for lunch. I heard about the Side Door and their tots. Tots are my favorite so I had to try this place out. 

Ambiance/Location
Lunch crowd is non-existent. So if you don't like crowds, you should come here for lunch. It was a bit hard to find this place. I posted a picture to show you the small sign. I didn't realize that you can enter the Samba building and The Side Door is located on the ground floor and Samba is upstairs. I haven't been to Samba yet either. So first timers --- go inside the main doors.

Appetizers
We ordered the Cheese Cubes and the South of the Border Tots. The cheese cues are hand breaded and fried cubes of Wisconsin Meunster Cheese served with a horseradish aioli. DELISH.We finished these first. The tots are masssssssiiiiivvvvveeeee. They are not your regular Sonic Tots. There were about 8 tots that were topped with black beans, nacho cheese, pico de gallo, guac and a citrus sour cream. The guac tasted fresh. The cheese made the tots perfect. The tots were hand rolled to perfection.

Lunch 
I ordered a Bacon Cheeseburger. Huge mistake --- I was full. I only ate a 1/4 of the burger. The best thing about the burger was the apple wood smoked bacon. I lied. Everything about this burger was great. The haystack onions were perfectly fried and there was a large amount  stacked. The aged cheddar melted perfectly on the burger and the BUNS were HOT and soft. I love a burger where the bun/bread is actually hot and not cold/room temp. 

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I was lost when trying to find this place and the sign was pretty small. Other than that....I will come again and try out their beers on tap; I didn't try them out this time because I had to go back to work. They had specials listed on a chalk board -- check them out!"}
{"text":"I must say, for going with the very first place we saw after parking....this turned out exceptionally well. 

I was with my vegetarian friend who had a mushroom & pepper sandwich she could not stop raving about. I on the other hand had to go with the burger that had a fried egg as well as avocado (that made it the healthy choice, right?) anywho, it was really good. Not to mention their fries were pretty stellar.

They had some other items on the menu that peaked my interest as well, too bad I'm not in this area often. I would definitely go back!

**Bonus: Nice outdoor seating. We were surprised to be one of the only tables during lunch.

**Double bonus: Our server was really nice!"}
{"text":"Go for the tots and taps. That's all you need.

The BF and I headed to The Side Door on a sunny, unseasonably warm Friday afternoon. We were a little confused to where it was until we saw a small sign with an arrow that pointed forward then left in a little table-filled walkway to the right of Samba. Once you get to the back of the walkway there's a door that leads down a few stairs and into a nice open bar and seating area. 

The Side Door is nothing fancy, but it's pleasant and, when we went, blessedly uncrowded. There's a large tap menu on the wall and they drop off several stapled pages listing the taps off at your table. While we skipped drinks on this go-round, there were a lot of tempting options. 

We started with the Baked Potater Tots - handmade tater tots doused with cheese sauce, sour cream, and bacon. They were phenomenal. Obviously terrible for you, but worth the caloric intake when you're craving that sort of thing. The taste reminded me of Tato Skins chips from my childhood, but, you know, with real ingredients. 

My gent and I each took down half the order, and I honestly could have stopped after that. I was full, but I'd already ordered dinner when we put in our tots order. 

I had ended up going with the Sunset Burger but with a black bean patty and no egg. On paper, the combination sounded good - potato bun, black bean burger, cheddar, guacamole, bacon-bourbon jam, lettuce, and tomato - ingredients I've eaten together several times before. The execution, however, didn't work for me. The bun was a little dry, the black bean burger's seasonings didn't meld with the rest of the toppings [not their fault, I made the substitution], and the bacon jam was almost non-existent. At first I thought they left it off (which would make sense with my meatless patty and no egg request) but the server said it was on the bottom bun. I had looked before asking her for the jam, and when I double checked it with her at the table she said the jam was what I thought was grease spots on the bun. My previous experiences with bacon jam is a chunky, rich mahogany spread, not an oil that's melted into the bread. The server did offer extra jam, but I decided to just eat it as the kitchen intended now that I knew it was there. With the black bean patty I couldn't taste it. 

The side salad I chose with my meal was just mixed greens and a side of my dressing choice - fine but nothing special. If there's going to be nothing to the salad besides greens I wish it came dressed with an interesting house dressing. Next time I'll have to look more closely at the menu to see what the dressing choices are and see if there's something better than my default choice of ranch when I don't know my other options. 

Now, my burger and salad weren't bad by any means, it was just a swing and a miss for my taste buds. The service and tots were great and I would happily return for them, and maybe venture into an entree salad or a flatbread pizza next time around if we're not going to gorge on the tots."}
{"text":"1st visit since the turn over again. I came with a GroupOn and will return. 
We had the Bacon Cheeseburger, Mushroom with Fontina and sauteed onions plus a Flatbread pizza that included cilantro in the pesto base (which is why I tried it). 

First, I don't like the flatbread - it's too thick. I don't know if it was wheat but it appeaered as such the next day but didn't taste like wheat. The buns were a fan favorite at the table as it was sooooo soft per the kid. 

I like the pickles - I think they're homemade as the cut isn't standard. Not to brine-y nor vinegar-y so. 

The service was lacking and we were the only table but she chatted the guy up at the bar. 
The decor is lovely but I always liked Samba and it's spin-offs. 

The drinks come from the bar wand so you do the math. 
No frozen drinks of any kind because they don't' have a blender. 

Happy Hour during every Sunday game. $5 wings, nachos, and something else with $3 pretzels. 

I hope something gets to make it here."}
{"text":"Great service! Excellent food! We ordered the sunset burger, probably one of the top 3 burgers I've ever eaten! Egg, avocado and the normal works. I couldn't finish the burger, way too big which was a great deal! Great people, cracked some jokes with the locals and bar staff. I'd come back and recommend as an out-of-towner."}
{"text":"Meh. Sh*tty food, sh*tty service. Not impressed...good beer though. Tater tots not worth it- they are just fried mashed potatoes (and that sounds far more pleasant than it actually is)"}
{"text":"The food deserves three stars, but the beer list and pricing bumps it up to four stars overall. The tap list is long and fun to browse. I like the menu with the descriptions of the beers, so I'm not choosing something new blindly. All of the beers are $4, which is not only a great price, but is appealing in its simplicity. 

We tried the volcano tots and they were all right. I got some type of Korean beef sandwich which was tasty but not really noteworthy. 

I would definitely return to try out some new brews!"}
{"text":"Shut the front door, that was a great burger. Dang. So big I couldn't finish it after I ate some fries.

Those beer battered fries were pretty scrumptious as well.  

Reasonable prices for hefty portions, classic and delicious pub-fare."}
{"text":"Nice spot. Good to catch up with a friend and grab some casual food and a drink.

Probably the best part about this restaurant is the huge list of awesome beers on tap for only $4! I ordered a cider (can't remember the name but I hadn't heard of it) that actually tasted like legitimate apple cider, just with alcohol. Very different from an angry orchard or a cider boys.

The food was really good - not the best I've ever had, but solid. I quite enjoyed my Mac n cheese and my friend liked her Seoul Patrol, which came with crispy and tasty fries. I would like to try more items from the menu, but I will say I wish there were a few more options."}
{"text":"Started my dinner off with a Mershons Artisan Cider, being this bad is the only one downtown to carry it, figured I should give it a try. A true unfiltered sweet Apple cider, beyond sweetness. 
Baked potaters tots for a starter. Almost could make a meal out of the tot-cheese-bacon creation. Tasty and crunchy, must share or you'll never eat your main meal. 
Mac n cheese on the menu means that's what I ordered. It's one of my staples that I like to order and compare at different places. Perhaps I didn't read the menu close enough but I wasn't prepared for the spicy! Not that that was a bad thing though. Perfect balance of spicy to creamy. Loved the Mac! Husband ordered the mushroom flatbread which is one of his favorites here. \"Cheesy and really like the sweetness of the onions. Delicious.\"
Super laid-back atmosphere which was quiet during our visit. Husband comes here often when he is downtown and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Very nice place for a bar and grill, clean, airy, spacious, well decorated, with a very nIce patio area. Great beer list. We tried the house made tater tots at the bartender's suggestion. Very good; large, cheesy with bacon and green onions. The sauce was odd, a sweet, lemony sour cream. We tried ranch and ketchup also but found that eating them plain was ok. We also had the 4 Ps flatbread pizza, which was fine, but underwhelming. The service was great, and the place was largely deserted due to Memorial Day weekend. We'd definitely come again and try other food offerings."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and fries. Great tap selection with $8 craft beer pitcher specials on certain happy hours. Kitschy but clean. Accommodating wait staff."}
{"text":"Went in the first time today. Looks like a nice place, somewhat decent prices. The tacos are over priced.


So I ordered a simple burger. They say it's cooked medium on the website but mine was quite well done, so much so I could not even finish it, tasted pretty burnt, like dog food. 

Very underwhelming and sad. definitely not a first good experience. Not sure if I'll go back when there's places like hawks that don't serve burnt food."}
{"text":"I took the plunge and bought a few groupons ($11 for $20 deal) after I scanned through the menu and found more than a few things that I wanted to try. Ohmygerddd those tater tots doe.

I ordered the seoul patrol sandwich with beer battered fries, and wow. I was not expecting much out of the bulgogi, but I was blown away by the bold flavors of the marinade. I would say that it compares to the bulgogi that I've had at Korean restaurants! I really loved the combination of the bulgogi and the tanginess/crunch of the kimchi. They definitely do not skimp on the meat or any of the other toppings! 

The menu is very reasonably priced, and for the portions you get, it is really a great deal. Although we didn't order any beverages other than water, I noticed that they have a pretty extensive wine and beer menu!

I'd also like to commend the server for being so accommodating with our request to sit outdoors (because the inside of the restaurant is really way too dark...and who wants to be stuck indoors when the sun is still out at 7PM??). Even though he was the only server working in the evening, he was still pretty attentive and did his best to check in on us whenever he could. 

I can't wait to be back to try something new on the menu, although knowing me, I'll probably order the seoul patrol again and again until I get sick of it. :P Jump on that groupon deal! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for a great cold brew and some appetizers.  
The homemade tater tots are indescribably delicious.  Four different varieties from southwest to loaded potato.  All four are amazing and each tot is as big as a roll of quarters but fatter.  
The bacon cheeseburger soup is my favorite.  They serve it with an out of this world chewy crusty bread to dip it in.  The mushroom flatbread is too good to leave out. It's perfect for two but my boyfriend has put a few away on his own. 
Each burger is fresh, grilled, grass fed beef on a ciabatta roll with fresh cheeses and toppings and come with uber crispy skin on fries or a side of mixed greens. 
Many, many great craft brews on tap and bottled.  Different ones each month. 
The Mac and cheese was the first I've ever ordered in a restaurant, but I had a toothache that day and it was soooooo good.  I would get it again and again.  Enough to fill you up and have some to take home for that midnight snack. 
Staff is so very kind, attentive, knowledgable of the menu and bar area.  Always feel welcome and comfortable here. great place to watch a game too."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place since we had a City Tin coupon and it has a decent Yelp rating. Sadly, there wasn't much to write home about.

First, there's no sign out front (it's underneath Samba). The GPS told us we were there, but we couldn't see it, so we walked up and down both sides of the street until we saw the menu out front and a small sign hanging from their patio gate.

Secondly, upon entry, there's no wait staff to greet you nor is there a sign saying 'seat yourself'. At least I didn't see one. (You seat yourself.)

We were promptly brought menus and a list of beers on tap. After that the service was nearly non-existent. We ordered a beer, a soda and started with the Baked Potater Tots. The tots are about 4x the side of normal tater tots and they were pretty good. Surprisingly, I didn't think they had a lot of flavor, but my husband did.

For dinner, I ordered the Sunset Burger with a side salad and my husband ordered the Seoul Patrol sandwich with fries. We sat around for quite a while talking and didn't realize how much time had gone by. The waitress had come and gone with the appetizer plate and didn't ask if we wanted refills or anything. After some more time had gone by she comes over to apologize as she had forgotten to put in our order and our meal would be on her.

Dinner came out relatively quick after that and we were asked if we wanted refills at that time. The side salad was a mix of greens, two slices of tomatoes, some pickles and dressing. It was good. The greens were tender and the veggies seemed to be fresh. The Sunset burger, though, wasn't good. It was so heavy from having guacamole, egg, melted cheese and jam that after a while it became complete mush. Neither of us liked the flavor either. My husband didn't care for this Seoul Patrol sandwich, but I had a bite and thought it was pretty good. It had great flavor and texture. The fries were also decent.

The waitress came back to check on us, we asked for a box, waited for another 10-15 minutes and we left. By this point it had been an hour and a half since we sat down, for essentially two burgers, and after seemingly being forgotten about all night we just wanted to leave.

I'm sure there are other items on the menu that taste better, but between the slow service, the lackluster food and atmosphere, it's highly unlikely that we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome little place that is well hidden and brings a cool vibe. Great beers, good menu that was pretty price friendly, and wonderful service. Very laid back and great spot to just relax and have a couple drinks and some pub eats."}
{"text":"Taters tots were good but the flatbread and Seoul were kind of mediocre.  Fish tacos were good but not spectacular.  Higher quality of ingredients could have helped menu items along, as well as a broader and deeper selection of items.  Looks like they have a good bar however."}
{"text":"I have to say, I really love this place.  Had it not been for word of mouth, I would've never found it.  Luckily I did.

All of the food is really good.  The fish tacos are ok, but I'd recommend the all you can battered cod on Fridays.  It's always been nice and crispy.  Even if you're looking for something light(er), the apps are awesome.  The homemade tots are a must.  And the house-made soups and cheesecake are great.  I honestly cannot say that, after over three years of patronage, I have had any bad food experience here.  Compliments to Shane for keeping the kitchen at that pace.

But the food isn't the reason I go there.  It's the beer.  Over 30 taps with many rotating through great craft brews.  Their happy hour makes the beer ridiculously cheap.  However, the best part of The Side Door is that they actually server beer properly!  Some places in the area use proper glassware, which is great.  What most places don't do is serve it at the correct temperature.  I find that I need to wait 5-10 minutes before being able to drink my beer at nearly everywhere else.  This place actually understands that a stout isn't meant to be served under 40 degrees.  That difference is huge on flavor.  It doesn't hurt that Spencer and the staff are amazing.

This place has set the bar for me, no pun intended.  I measure all other bars by it."}
{"text":"I had the Churrasco flatbread pizza and enjoyed it.  my wife had the Korean tacos and was disappointed describing it as bad potluck hot beef.  the outdoor patio is a nice place to sit on on a summer evening."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this bar while in Madison for a concert. I'll definitely be back. Happy hour is great. All beers are 4 dollars. Didn't get any food, but everything that came out looked and smelled amazing. Check this place out for sure."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot! Close to campus, not very crowded, good derive, delicious food! The deserts are huge and taste really good!"}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos, which I used to love. Tonight they were meh. Service was okay. My friend had the warm pear salad and enjoyed that"}
{"text":"What an awesome place. Went last night based on yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. Brews were excellent. I tried the cider first. Had two great pumpkin inspired ales to follow. Hubby had a October fest ale which was so good he stuck with it. Great variety and can't beat the price. Food was also excellent. We started with the pretzels with two dips (cheese of course) and the other a beer mustard. Both were yum. Together (yes i double dipped) such depth and flavor. The pear pecan salad was perfect for me after 3 or so beers. Hubby had the beer batter fish and chips. We left full and satisified. What a bargain. Going back tonight"}
{"text":"The Side Door is a nice reliable pub with tasty food and reasonable prices. Get the tots!

We've gone here numerous times with Groupons and simply because \"it's next door.\" It's about 1 block from our apartment and it's awesome to have a simple gastropub with a variety of apps, beer, and burgers.

On the most recent visit, I tried the Surly fish fry. It was awesome! Huge portions with crispy fish. I got tots as my side instead of fries, and it was such a good choice. Just listen to the people and try the tots. They are huge and so much better than the frozen things. I will say that I'm a little disappointed they changed the name from \"Tot-chos\" to \"South of the Border Tots.\" Those are my favorite by far: cheese, guac, and other nacho toppings on top of tots. 

I also opted for some white wine since we were sitting outside and it was a warm summer evening. SD has a bunch of $5 beers and the rest of the drinks are equally reasonably priced. 

Can't wait to come back next time we need a quick dinner or can't decide where to go!"}
{"text":"Very good.  I had the bacon chicken wrap--very tasty.  My husband wasn't as thrilled with his pulled pork sandwich.  The fries were excellent.  Service was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"We've been here before and the food is delicious but we had a horrible service experience tonight. The place was DEAD (which makes bad service so much worse). No one was in the dining room and only a few patrons at the bar. We sat ourselves and the bartender brought over menus. Didn't ask us if we wanted drinks which is usually what servers do when they greet a table. We sat and sat. I finally went to the bar to tell her we were ready but she was too busy having a conversation about becoming a manager somewhere else. I interrupted her and said \"we are ready to order and in a bit of a time crunch.\" She looked annoyed and said \"I'll be over shortly.\" I returned to my seat and told my boyfriend what she said -- we decided to just go ahead and leave when we heard her continuing her conversation. What a waste of a trip there. Too bad bc they have good burgers. Get a new bartender Side Door or at least another server who cares about making some money."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! In a great location and it's only crowded on game days. Great staff and amazing tater tots."}
{"text":"Despite never personally seeing much business at The Side Door Grill & Tap the food and beer selection is great. I can't go without ordering the homemade pretzel breadsticks. Simple, satisfying and just plain delicious. Every month they have a craft beer pitcher on special for about $8. The burgers and sandwiches have always been desirable but my favorite, most recent discovery was their Fish & Chips. Side Door does not have a Friday Night Fish Fry but luckily has the fish on the menu every night, which is now one of my favorite fried fish in town."}
{"text":"I love this place. BO-GO Happy Hour may well be the best deal in town, not to mention that they have a great tap list AND descriptions of the beers on the menu. As a beer snob, I greatly appreciate this. Beyond that, all beers only cost $4. Gun to my head, I say this is actually the best bar in the campus vicinity. Library and City Bar have a mythos about them, but I think this place has got 'em beat. I haven't eaten here, but people swear by the Potater Tots.  (P.S. The Happy Hour is from 2:00-5:00, which is a bit too early to make this place a 5-star spot.)"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a bar the south of the border tots are delish and the mushroom flat bread is pretty tasty as well :) good find"}
{"text":"Cheap drinks, nice bartenders, low-key. What's not to love?"}
