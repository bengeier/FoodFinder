{"text":"Great service & fun atmosphere. Their fajitas are yummy, and the fish n chips too! Best part is they care about their customers' satisfaction and will take good care of you!"}
{"text":"Best wings!  Tuesday night is wing night and of course the place is packed.  It's worth the wait.  Lots of flavours to choose from and it's always consistent.  Staff are friendly and as long as you are not in a rush, wing night is a deal.  We've come on other nights and it's standard pub fare, nothing that stands out.  Highly recommend the wings if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Good service but the food is terrible and very generic. Use to love this place 10 years ago during high school and not a thing has changed. Its very dated and out of touch with modern day bars. If your looking for a place to bring the kids for a burger or chicken fingers you'll enjoy this place but if your looking for a night out with friends you will have to look for another bar."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and my boyfriend's mom and her friends go almost every week for wings! The wings are awesome here, and cheap. They have a really nice menu with some cool different options than a typical pub would have. The service has always been friendly. Whenever I'm around Oakville I try to come here!"}
{"text":"Great pub style food with good service. I enjoy going stopping in at the bar as well as grabbing a bite at the restaurant. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Best wings around by far. They've remained consistent over the years. Others haven't."}
{"text":"We went in a small group: - two families with 3 kids on Thanksgiving Monday. Place was less than busy for lunch and that made our 40 minute wait for food completely unexplainable. The waitress was incredibly rude and indifferent. After 30 minutes of waiting, with all the kids crying for their food, we asked how much longer it would take, and she shrugged indifferently. It took ten more minutes to get our order: one fish and chips, three sandwiches, two kiddie grilled cheese sandwiches and one kids' chicken fingers. Hardly gourmet fare that takes a while to cook. At no point during this time did anyone ask us how we are doing or whether we want anything. My fish and chips was burned on the outside and raw inside. Left it after two bites. My son's chicken fingers at $10 a child's meal were three frozen shaped pieces of chicken that is sold for $2.99 a box in every supermarket freezer and a bunch of soggy fries. Absolutely appalling. He is not a big eater but after he gulped down that pitiful portion he asked where is the rest. I had to feed him again when we got home. To top it all off, we had to wait another 20 minutes for our bill, until another server took pity on us and produced it. Absolutely the worst dining experience in Oakvile ever. Maybe if all you want is beer on a Friday night this is a decent place, but I would suggest to any family to go nearby Burloak and try one of the restaurants there - you will eat better and spend less."}
{"text":"Good place, I recommend the Long Island ice tea and the bruschetta bombs! There could be a vegetarian burger and a vegetarian soup on the menu to make it a five star bar/restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ate last night.  this the first review I ever write on yelp  Just want to warn people that it's very expensive paid $40 for wings and 1 beer  The wings are just ok they don't even give you  Hot sauce . The restaurant is very nice the service need improvement"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. Tried the burgers, appetizer platter, and wings. Great food every time. Good service as well. Overall a nice casual and family friendly place :)"}
{"text":"Great place in Oakville. I like the food, and the mood. Every time I've been here it has been really busy.  The decor is hard to classify, I'd probably call it 'casual'. It's not the most wonderful ever, but I don't hate it. It has many little sections to it.  The food is actually pretty good. While they don't have too many flavors, the ones that they have are quite good. On top of this the wings are really big and meaty too, really excellent quality wings. A couple nights a week (I forget which but it probably says on their website) they have a wing special. The special is really good, if I recall it's two sets for the price of one. The night of the wing special is extra busy.   No matter how busy the night is, the service doesn't suffer, they've really got it down. Every server I've had has been polite and courteous.   I'd recommend this place anytime, especially to a wing-lover. Their other food is good too, I've tried a few other dishes."}
{"text":"Frozen, greasy burgers.  It would take so little to make 'real' burgers.  Instead, we were served a huge,  not thoroughly cooked patty dripping with grease.  It was kinda sad, really.    When I was 20, I'd think it was great.  Now, not so much.  There's lots of places around that serve great burgers.  This place isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Food is pretty high quality but the prices are high for weird portion sizes (salad was huge, fish and chips weirdly small)"}
{"text":"Nice people but terrible food. The nephew ordered ravioli which should have been simple- no sauce. Came covered in Alfredo sauce. Sent it back. I ordered a chicken sandwich and it arrived with a piece of paper with pen ink on it inside.  I'm aware this probably isn't a typical experience for most people who dine here, but it was for us.  2 out of the 5 of us received our food once the others had pretty much finished theirs. We weren't charged for the mistakes, which was nice...  My husband ordered the fish and chips. The batter lacked flavor except for the grease it was dripping with. The tartar sauce had a layer if skin on it. The coleslaw had too much dressing, it was quite soupy.  Sister in law had a Greek salad. Do yourself a favor and don't bother- you could make it better and more special at home for a fraction of the price. My niece had a burger and fries, it looked ok and she ate it.  No hard feelings, but I'd never go back or recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Just had dinner at the Firehall tonight.  Service was awesome!!!  The service at the Firehall used to be hit-or-miss, but it has been great the past few months.  I saw a gentlemen (I assume a manager) walking around making sure every party was having a great experience.   The Firehall is quickly climbing my list of favorite restaurants in the Oakville area.  The Firehall is located in Bronte."}
{"text":"Must have wings... Saturday night at 9pm drove over to Burlington to try it out based on Yelp reviews.   Seated promptly and servers were friendly.  Ordered wings and ribs.  Food was good and portions were generous.  Definitely worth trip back!"}
{"text":"My family likes coming here to eat! They always rave about how good the wings are! I'm a vegetarian so when we do go I find that there's not enough options on the menu for non meat eaters! I think there needs to be more vegetarian options for sure! Not every vegetarian wants to just eat a salad for dinner.. I also find it odd how they don't have nachos on the menu! What pub style restaurant doesn't serve nachos?? In my option the menu needs some work!"}
{"text":"best wings hands down. service is hit or miss. prices are very fair. this is our go-to wing spot."}
{"text":"I love their wings.   As good as or better than anyone.   Every Time I'm in oak like I like to get there"}
{"text":"False Advertising. Good food, but having to tell my two kids that there wouldn;t be any real firemen coming to visit us at our table was the most difficult thing I may have ever had to do in my life. I was under the impression real firemen would come and give my two kids a ride in the firetruck or play with the hoses. My one son, Terry, didn't come out of his room for two days afterwards. He also doesn't want to be a fireman anymore. He wants to be an accountant. :("}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because I've been back multiple times and the service has been very consistent - friendly and prompt. And the managers always circulate and check in with each table. The patio is big and I've really enjoyed sitting out there sipping cocktails while trying out their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Best place in town for wings! Tuesday's are half priced wing night and it gets quite busy in here!  They have a great patio which is always lively!"}
{"text":"Good local place.  Ok food, not great."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday late afternoon . Was fairly quiet I guess due to the time and day . Ordered wings and I have to say I was very pleased , very happy ! The wings were a great size . Juicy and very tasty ! Service was good ,friendly and prompt ! All in all I think I found my new wing place !"}
{"text":"Hands down the best chicken wings!  The place has great character. Hope they can recreate that in their new place."}
{"text":"All I keep hearing was the wings are huge! The Wings are huge! The Wings are Huge! I'll admit that the wings are bigger compared to most popular wing places but they weren't the biggest that I've seen!  One of my girls recommended this place to me, mind you I was pretty sceptical b/c she's recommended places to eat before and they were just okay. I'll still give her the chance plus I love trying new places to eat!  So me and my boyz came here on a Tuesday b/c it's 2 for 1 wings. To be more specific u get 16 wings for the price of one. One order of wings which is 8 pieces is usually $10.25, which is a complete rip off for wings but when it's 2 for 1 it's okay.   When I got to the location it was pretty busy and it was only 4pm. It was also a beautiful hot day so we decided to take advantage of it and sit on the patio. My one friend complained it was hella hot, I told him to suck it up and wait till winter to eat back inside restaurants. I like the fact that the patio had either smoking or nonsmoking sections. I can't stand that smoke while I'm eating.   The waitress was very prompt, polite, and also gave us suggestions on which wings to get. Along with the wings we all ordered a beer which was roughly a little over $5, not too bad but it could be better. After about 15 minutes our wings had arrived.   First impression, they were not the wings I was expecting. For one, the earlier reviews stated the wings were huge, they are bigger than most wing places but I was expecting like turkey size wings like they had at Rubicon in Mississauga. If you're wondering Rubicon got burned down so you can't go there to experience their turkey size chicken wings. Two,  I was expecting really saucy wings, fortunately they were not saucy at all, I'm not a fan of saucy wings, however some of the wings didn't have enough sauce.   The moment of truth the taste! Now we all got a total of 6 different sauces. Baja Chipotle, Stupid Hot, Buffalo Butter, Sweet chili, Dry Spice, Smokey BBQ. Favourites was Baja Chipotle and Buffalo Butter. The Baja was very flavorful it reminded me of more of a JD Whisky BBQ more than anything and the buffalo butter had that medium spice to it and packed full of juice and flavor b/c of the butter. The sweet chili is the same as everywhere else, Smokey BBQ had a sweet touch to it, and the stupid hot wasn't as \"STUPID\" hot as we though only b/c me and my boyz are use to eating really hot and spicy food so I would say someone who doesn't like spicy food this will ruin your meal, someone who likes spice will have no problem. The worst one was the dry spice, and the only reason was b/c you couldn't taste any of the spice it was like biting into a wing with no seasoning at all. Mind you, you can smell the seasoning but for some reason we couldn't taste it.   Good experience, the wings are good but not good enough for me to drive that far. They didn't have that effect where I wanted more like All Star Wings. If I happen to be in the area and craving wings that's probably the only time I would come back.  Items to definitely get:  - 2 for 1 wings for $10.25 plus tax - Baja Chipotle - Buffalo Butter - Stupid Hot"}
{"text":"The wings are what we really go there for. Always pretty good. I wish they would get some more creative sauces like other places but I always enjoy either way. Service has always been good. If you are going on Tuesdays for the wing night get there before 5.15 or you'll be waiting."}
{"text":"Decent bar but I've got to say, this is possibly the least vegetarian friendly eatery in the country (possibly the planet)!  Throw a veggie burger or veggie pizza in there guys!  Lots of groups that go to places like yours have at least one vegetarian (or freak as I'm guessing you'd call them) in the party...make at least a token effort...sheesh."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and all around a good time!  Went there Friday night for \"Flip For Your Fish\" where you can get your fish and chips dinner for free if you win a coin toss. I've been here a couple of times now and always enjoy it. The wings are phenomenal... the best I've had in Oakville by far. The place is busy but doesn't have that overcrowded feeling. They had a large number of wait staff so the service is great."}
{"text":"Take your kids here on Monday! They eat for FREE if they wear a fireman's hat purchased from the restaurant.  They can eat for free on subsequent visits as long as they wear the hat.    For adults, I recommend the chicken wings.  The chicken is batter fried and coated with a sticky, sweet, deep red sauce. Remarkably, the wings remain crispy and crunchy even though they are bathed in the sauce. A fun place for families!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit confused.   The Fire Hall has recently moved from just down the road to their new location. The location itself and the interior of the restaurant are actually very nice.   However, it is almost as if it is a new restaurant entirely. My family and I were there last night for dinner and we experienced what I would describe as a terrible opening night. Despite the fact that it had been re-opened for awhile, as well as the fact that it was previously a well established and functional restaurant. In my mind, you just do the same thing slightly down the road. No interruption in service... Is that naive?  There was plenty of wait staff last night, yet no one in particular was serving us. Everyone seemed to running around slightly confused, including multiple floor managers. We had to ask for a diet coke and water 4 different times before we received it.   The food we ordered from a very pared down menu (i'm talking 20 items here, total) was lacklustre. My wrap was okay, if drowning in ranch dressing. The fries were really basic, I've had better out of my own oven. The top bun of my mom's burger looked like it had been stepped on before landing on her plate. Totally mangled, we had to send it back. My brother seemed happy with his meal, though he is easy to please.   At the end of all this, they gave us the wrong bill which included liquour we never ordered. Then the young man had the nerve to appear visibly disappointed when he picked up his tip. I will not return to the Fire Hall."}
{"text":"It's a decent bar, with a fairly big patio that is nice in the summer.  Nothing too special about this place, and the few times I have been here there weren't too many other patrons.    It serves typical bar food and drinks.  The theme makes it a bit different.  But I wouldn't come too far out of my way to dine here.   I recommend this place for groups of friends, for drinks, food, and maybe watching sports.    Derek"}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place, luckily, on a Tuesday night.  It happened to be \"wing night\" and the bartender, Wendy, convinced me to try two types of their wings.  I loved them both.  Service was excellent, and so was the atmosphere, including cleanliness.  The clientele and the staff were exceptionally friendly to this out-of-towner.  i will definitely be back when I'm in town again!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  I understand this place is sort of a popular local spot. I found the food and overall experience to be just ordinary.   Ordered the wings and the fish on a Friday. The wings were sizeable but not a lot of flavour.   They have a \"flip for fish\" promotion on Fridays where you flip a coin for a free meal. We were never given the chance.  If you decide to go, I would recommend the deep fried pickles."}
{"text":"Boy this is a busy place.  I took a seat at the bar and bypassed a long wait.  Tuesday's special was 2 for 1 wings, which were huge.  As a craft beer snob from Michigan, I must take a star away for the lack of a decent craft IPA.  In fairness, the Firehall is a victim of the truly sad scene in Ontario. That said, the Molson Canadian did go down easy."}
{"text":"Best wings I have EVER HAD. I've been coming to firehall for over 8 years now, and always for wings. They are absolutely incredible, but have gotten incredibly popular. A hour wait on wing night (Tuesday) is typical, if not more. The servers are friendly and the bar is great. They are lacking a bit on consistency unfortunately. Sometimes the wings come out and taste as if they have been sitting out for a while and are lacking the fresh crisp they normally have. But when they are good, MAN... they are good.  Honey Hot all the way."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my friends for \"girl's night\" (though OUR girl's night includes talking about new comic book titles and Harry Potter board games), and both times, I was SO glad I went. We've eaten inside and out on the patio, and I definitely prefer the patio. It's so laid back, and if the weather is nice, it's nice to eat outside!  The staff are always friendly, and the food is delicious. I especially love that one of the nights, you can flip a coin with a manager to get your fish meal for free! Their wings are delicious and I love, love, love their sweet potato friends with the chipotle mayo. Just love this place."}
{"text":"Rating is a Three Minus  Good Service, Sunny patio, good place to meet with friends  Ok menu, standard pub menu, wings are average, decent watering station  basic roadhouse  best asset is close to good walking paths"}
