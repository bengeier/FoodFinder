{"text":"I'm a bit of a comic book geek so upon hearing that a there was a comic book themed restaurant in Toronto, I just had to check it out!  Even better, my birthday was coming up so I decided it would be great to do a group reservation (~12 people).  We came on a Friday evening around 6:15pm and the restaurant was empty... it started filling up around 7:30pm.  The restaurant is easy to miss since the entrance is \"hidden\".  On the outside, it looks like a small store with walls that are plastered with comic strips and a couple of collectibles on sale.  It's not until you talk to the hostess, do you realize there is a \"secret entrance\".  I was a little bit disappointed with the entrance - I was hoping there would be a long hallway or stairway you had to walk though to get to the restaurant but it just takes you directly in.  You are not allowed to take any photos or videos of the walls in the restaurant itself to \"preserve its mystery\" but there was a cute mirror near the washrooms you can take some cute selfies in.  The catch?  The mirror is situated in a space that has a lot of foot traffic coming to and from the washroom, as well as the servers coming from the kitchen.    Once seated, we ordered a couple of drinks (we asked for the most instaworthy ones) - Johnny Blaze, Maleficent and Rarely On Target.  Drinks were okay - but i'm not sure if it's worth the $20 price tag (at that price point, I'd rather pay a little extra and go to Barchef)  Figures is a tapas style restaurant so our group settled on a several dishes to share: the in-house pasta (3 - which was a tomato & crab gnocchi), halibut (2), salmon (2), canadian lamb (2) and muscovy duck (2). Overall, food was just okay - especially at the price point we were paying.  My only complaints: the foie gras that came with the lamb dish was not portioned well for the dish and the duck soup was a bit too salty.    If this was the end of my review, I'd give Figures 3 stars.  HOWEVER, service was just ridiculously slow here. We ended up waiting upwards of 10 minutes for the dessert menu (which we ended up not ordering because our waiter took too long with the menu) and then, another 30-45 minutes for our bill (we had to request our bills 3 times).  Hence, the two stars.  It was an interesting concept, but I felt a little underwhelmed and I'm not sure if I'll come back."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Amazing venue. Amazing drinks. Amazing food. Amazing music. 5 star in every way. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great Comic Book chick ambiance with beautiful artwork and friendly staff but eventhough drinks by the mixologist are delicious and orginal, they are extremely overpriced and not worth it to be honest. Also as with most tapas places expect very small portions with steep prices. I know they are catering to the rich Yorkville crowd but it's a shame that such a cool place doesn't catter to a larger audience as they could become world famous."}
{"text":"One star for decoration and fun entrance, One more star for the bar and drink. We did get management's compensation for our terrible time there.  (However the compensation was not addressed until I searched for the manager and gave him our disappointing account of this 8 week old restaurant.  First of all, a pricy restaurant given its location, hype and decoration, I get it and sure why not. But hell! give us the quality that should come with the price tag.  Small portion is fine, but the cooking technique and style feels pretentious and subpar.  Cherry clams with Thai curry sauce?  - Salty very salty, I did not get the sweet taste from the seafood.  Duck with brownie and chocolate sauce and a Mickey mouse cookie? - dense, flavour is all over the place if I am Gordon Ramsey I would say \"did the fucking chef threw up on the plate and decorated with a Mickey mouse cookie?\" Pasta also very dense but I didn't mind the flavour that's a good one. The Crab cake was also nice too but nothing amazing.  The Octopus was really well made and tender. NOW The Pork...The wonderful pork that was RAW, I am glad I know when I can't cut thru meat it's raw.  BEWARE! The lighting is so dim I needed my phone's flash to confirm it is raw. I waved three times and I was ignored until I have to shout across the room and someone came over and said o do you want another one ? Or just forget it?  I said forget it.  ( Also there were only four tables and 8 people on the floor, they were all hovering around the kitchen. I called it over staff  under service)   the drinks were nice, I do salute the bar for doing their best.  I got a nice blueberry lemonade mocktail, my friends at the table liked their drinks too.  End of night we just want to get the bill which came to around $400 with 6 of us. And the Raw Pork was billed on it.  That's when I knew we were not being taken seriously  as valuable customers.  I searched for the manager and he then apologize and said he will handle it and sorry we had a bad time. (Right 9 of you not including kitchen staff and on the floor 13 clients still managed to screw up). The bill came back reduced to $200plus...We were comp none alcohol drinks and two cheapest appetizers.  Yes I feel better that they did finally did something.  I appreciate that, it managed to subdue my inner Asian Kracken.  Will I go back? No...Will they survive the ever changing TO culinary world? NOT if they keep up that \"excellent\" service.  Also chefs make mistake, but with a max. Staff and min. Customers and still F Up so much?  8 weeks maybe a short time. I hope you can see this review and do something about it.  Hope in the future I read something from someone stating it's a Wonderful restaurant...And maybe just maybe I will try again. Good luck Figures...Your gimmick worked on us..However it will Not survive. ( WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH NO PICTURES OF THEIR DECORATION INSIDE THE RESTAURANT?)"}
{"text":"Wow. I was a kid again. The wall art is just phenomenal, the atmosphere, the service, and the drinks are out of this world. Can wait to return next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"We had a very poor meal the other night. We left hungry and angry. The server was pretentious and unhelpful. I made an unhappy remark as we were leaving and she could not have cared less. The plates were so small that we would have needed a load of plates to serve our whole family. Is the chef feeding people or making pretty little tastes for a culinary magazine?  At $20'a shot, the price of an actual meal is ridiculous. The review below describing the dishes, especially the chocolate duck pile o' barf, is dead accurate.  The music is so loud that you cannot talk to your party.  If you want to go to an empty bar and have a taste of a snack with your drink, then the place might suffice. But do not go here for a meal."}
{"text":"I love this place ! The drinks are unreal The food is to die for  The tiny details of the design of Figures is nothing like I have ever seen.  The DJ is the bomb  Amazing amazing amazing."}
{"text":"Wow! Incredible atmosphere, Figures Toronto transcends your typical night out into an incredibly culinary experience!   Owen was an incredible GM and Eleni created some of the best cocktails I have ever had! Figures Toronto is a must!"}
{"text":"Okay I went there last night with my bf, I was a little skeptical at first because I don't really care for comics or whatever but once I got there it was nice. I liked the entrance even though I didn't know a single comic book character lol I was pleasantly surprised by the inside. It's a high end restaurant lounge and it's not gimmicky, it's trendy. The drinks are delicious, the manager talked to us personally and asked about our experience which was nice. It is a high end Yorkville restaurant and the prices reflect that, but you're in Yorkville it shouldn't come as a surprise. Good date spot me and bf would come back and he totally nerded out."}
{"text":"Went here with friends last night and service was amazing. The problem is the food. It was pretty bland and overpriced. It's a neat concept of a hidden bar restaurant but certainly not a place that will frequent. Without delicious food, a gimmick and quality service won't win over customers."}
{"text":"We booked our company party in the middle of October for December 14.  On November 23rd, a month after we booked our event and 3 weeks before the party, General Manager, Owen Figueroa, cancelled our event, for which invitations had already been sent out. They even took our credit card to secure a deposit when we booked our event. Completely unprofessional behaviour. I would not recommend that you count on this restaurant's General Manager to ensure that any reservation you make there will be honoured."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way. Going back for the 5th time this evening. This time taking my father there for his 55th bday.   Every time I have gone i have been blown away by outstanding service, special accomedations to me as a vegan and a ton of creativity from the bar manager as well as the chef.   Management is always touching tables and going above and beyond to make you feel at home. They have before adjusted the music and the heat for me. No one else does that!  I love the late night drinks there. Not crazy, free of pros unlike most places in toronto. Just a great dining spot and adult playground.   If you are industry you will see the details they pay attention to that most people miss."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurants with lots of anime character. Waiter Dave was great ! Five stars definitely :)"}
{"text":"This was out first restaurant of our trip to Toronto. Hubby being a comic addict and my fam being California foodies, thought this might a good place to start. First off the concept is great. Masqueraded as a comics storefront with a hip restaurant behind a secret door, so fun! The place isn't huge, but a good size with a nice bar. Service was awesome and attentive. But the food was pretty meh. Presented nicely, but more looks than tastes. And for the price, you're paying for the ambiance then anything. They also aren't too keen on you taking photos of inside the restaurant. As for trying again, probably not. But it's fun for a comic nerd, not expecting too much from the food."}
{"text":"Came here for desserts with my boyfriend for his birthday and we were definitely not disappointed! The entrance was very cool and the hostess was incredibly kind and accommodating. Our server was incredibly professional and well-versed in the menu. Although we were only here for a quick bite, we will definitely be returning! We ordered the cones desert which came very beautifully presented, and they also made my boyfriend feel very welcome and special on his birthday, something I really appreciated. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"AMAZING PLACE!!!  Can't say enough about this place. EXCELLENT food and FANTASTIC drinks. GREAT service. BEAUTIFUL ambiance. Such a COOL comic book/super hero themed bar/restaurant.   If I had one complaint, it was the music. It was WAY too loud. It's not a club and we were screaming at each other while eating our amazing dishes. PLEASE lower the volume?  I love loud music but save it for a club, which you are not?  You're kick ass bar and amazing restaurant!!    You must try this place!!!  Cool comic book and movie goodies to buy at the entrance as well. Treat yourself to this unique, and cool secret hang out."}
{"text":"This Comic Book themed restaurant in Yorkville means HULK SMASH your wallet . Figures.  Finally visited Figures after being in my list for a while. Food is ok overall, but the experience was unremarkable - nothing spectacular to justify the high price. All dishes are tapas style so they are small portions. My favorites were the Arctic Char and Canadian Lamb, and they were the most worth it too in terms of portion if you decide to go.  7 foodies split 8 dishes plus I had an $18 cocktail (cheapest they have is $16 ). My bill before tip was $50, and I felt like I only ate an appetizer that dinner. A kryptonite to my wallet ."}
{"text":"Figures has successfully combined superhero fun, with a 5 star cocktail selection and menu. The staff are warm and attentive, and the service is excellent!  Very satisfying dining experience for adults who are young at heart. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So much fun with interesting delicacies.  Fun cocktails and energetic warm staff with a great knowledge of the menu.  Alex and Owen are great and Dillion and Patrick behind bar are master mixers"}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious and enjoyed the meal, so I thought I'd go back and try their regular menu - totally regret it. It took about 50 mins from the time we ordered for our food to arrive. We had the Perogies, which was yummy!  We also got the wings, which in my opinion is on par with just regular wings. Very small portions - 3 pieces each, and each cost about $20. For entree, we got the TV dinner and Wagu burger. All I can say is SALTY!!! (And I like salty foods!) Would not mind the $120 bill if the food was at least good. Lots of REALLY GOOD places that you can go for that price, and you will get better food and probably faster service. Gave them 3 for service because they at least kept us hydrated while we waited... also to possibly combat all the salt we were about to be served."}
{"text":"A superhero-themed restaurant where the theme seemed to encompass everything other than the food. The first thing I noticed was the entryway smelled strange, the actual restaurant didn't smell much better. The drinks were tasty. The waiter was friendly but not particularly helpful. They tout this as a sharing/tapas restaurant, but recommended only getting 2-3 plates, which was confusing. The food was quite good - I'd categorize as Canadian - but expensive for the portion sizes. The scallops were my favourite dish."}
{"text":"Amazing venue, everything from the drinks to the food was amazing. I had some really unique drinks! Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"We LOVED it here- neat environment the food  was DELICIOUS but, portions were a little smaller than expected (and we wanted MORE).  We ordered the Halibut and the Salmon as well as an appetizer.  The only other complaint we have is that their least expensive bottle of wine was $50 and their mixed 'specialty' drinks were close to $ 20 each.   But, honestly the food was DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a bachelorette party I had helped plan because I found it on Opentable and thought the concept was interesting. Unfortunately the experience went downhill after we walked through the \"secret\" door.   We were the first to arrive of our group of 10 and immediately the waitress informed us that we have a 1.5h seating limit because they were booked solid. Worried that the rest of our party would not show up in time to order and eat, we were rushed into ordering before the entire group arrived.   Our waitress informed us that the plates were meant for sharing. She suggested about 2 plates per person but given each plate was $20-50, it seemed quite steep. When describing the dishes, the waitress was extremely pretentious and tried really hard to make the dishes sound fancier than they actually were. She even described a dish completely incorrectly when it arrived, calling veal lamb and reciting everything she memorized for the lamb dish. Hungry, we were really disappointed to find out that $20-50 could only buy you 3 shrimp or 2 small pieces of meat with 3 brussel sprouts.  How exactly did she think 10 people were going to share that? You couldn't even tell where the lamb was in the pot pie. Needless to say I've been to fine dining restaurants with way better value. Some of the girls actually went to Mcd's afterward.  Admittedly the cocktails were creative and reflective of the super hero theme. This is the onky reason why I awarded 2 stars instead of 1. Although they were pricey, they used flames, smoking cinnamon sticks and liquid nitrogen to justify the $20 price tags.   By the time our 1.5h were up, we had finished all our food but did not have time for dessert. When I asked the waitress for the bill in order to speed up our departure, she told me not to worry, she was able to push the next reservation to another table. If she had told us that earlier we would not have felt so rushed even though the restaurant wasn't even full.   Bottom line: Save your money and go to a real fine dining restaurant where the experience isn't such a gimmick. I expect that this place will go out of business as soon as the novelty wears off as I can't imagine there being very many repeat customers."}
{"text":"Swanky, young and good music and the food and service was great.  The dancefloor opened up later and it was a really good looking crowd.  Loved it"}
{"text":"Figures is located near Yorkville in downtown TO (although not directly in the heart of Yorkville; it's on Avenue Road) and thus was part of a more posher area than other neighbourhoods.  The hostess found out it was our first time to the restaurant and gave us a brief introduction about the restaurant.  Once we were inside, we weren't allowed to take photos of the mural wall but that everything else was okay.  Then she directed me to press a button in the design of Captain America's shield and the hidden door (camouflaged by comic book figures) opened to reveal the restaurant itself.  This was really cool!  The area where the hostess's table was also acted as a vintage toy store where there was a shelf with items for sale.  One look at the drinks menu told me that the price point for this restaurant was going to be high.  The cheapest cocktail was $16 and ranged all the way to $30, the most expensive one.  Only a few of the drinks had some relevance to comic books.   K ordered the \"Web Slinging Spider Hombre\" since its name sounded like it might be uniquely themed.  When it arrived, it had some blue foam at the top but no comic book figures (are my expectations too high?!  Lol).  Taste-wise, it was a little sour but did taste good.   Again, the menu items were quite pricey when portioned individually and the server did inform us before we ordered that it was going to be more of a tapas style dinner where the dishes were in small portions and designed to be shared.   When we placed our order, the server informed us that these weren't going to be enough for the seven of us and that it would be better if we picked two more.  Hmm... to me, it sounded more like a firm insistence on the extra items rather than a polite recommendation.  Nevertheless, we gave in and did order one more dish and added the Calamari.  The server again insisted that we needed one more item, like an extra Quail perhaps.  But we resisted and said we were fine and would order more afterwards if needed.  Thank goodness we resisted.  The Global Artichoke had shallots and balsamic.  There was a jelly on the side with a character imprinted on it.  Overall, this dish was all right.    The In-House Gnocchi was all right.  It was soft but could have been more pillow-y.  I also thought that the crunchy vegetables on top of it didn't go well with the gnocchi.  The Norwegian Calamari had sweet peppers and oregano.  I enjoyed this dish!  The calamari was so flavourful and perfectly cooked; it wasn't firm or rubbery at all.   The Spanish Octopus ended up being an interesting dish.  Other than the tentacle part, there were a few strips of meat that didn't look or taste much like octopus at all.  The dish itself did smell fishy enough to suggest octopus but many of us tried the meat and thought it tasted more like the texture of chicken instead.  It was such a mystery to us that we actually hailed the server down and asked about it.   The Arctic Char was beloved by many at our table.  This was a really good portion too (the biggest we'd seen thus far) and came with cauliflower and tarragon.    The Soft Shell Crab was disappointing.  I love soft shell crab in general.  This came with corn and poblano which I thought didn't match well with the fried crab at all.  This dish was difficult to share.  The Quail came with apricot slices and coffee cream.  The quail meat was all right.  Quails are very small birds and thus there wasn't much meat to share (no wonder the server recommended two quails for our table -- but seriously, $30 for a quail dish?).  The apricot slices were very fresh!  Last but not least, we got one more redeeming dish.  This was the Canadian Lamb dish that came with summer squash and rosemary.  The lamb was delicious!  It was moist, a little over-salted but delicious and juicy.    I thought that it was cool that our bills were presented in actual comic books that we could then take home!   For the amount of money that we spent on the bill, we really only got a couple of bites in (I recognize that we were a table of 7 and didn't order the number of \"recommended dishes\" to share but still I thought the prices were very inflated and the portions were small).  We actually decided to go to a pizza parlour right after the dinner to fill up the rest of our stomach space.  I left the restaurant having gained insight into what Figures was all about but definitely felt disappointed and jipped.  Only one dish had any visual allusion to a (comic book) character and the rest were all just fine dining dishes where not everything tasted great either.  Some ingredients were great and some not so good.  In other words, the dishes weren't consistent in their tastes.  Unless you have the money to blow on tiny tapa dishes and really want to come here for the hype, I would suggest trying another restaurant instead."}
{"text":"My friends and I are both nerds and foodies so we decided to come check out Figures. We were sat at the bar and the amazing Eleni (YOU ARE AWESOME!) was our bartender/server. The food and cocktails were EXCELLENT.. service IMPECCABLE. The atmosphere was chill and we loved the comic book themed decor. Every dish we ordered was fresh, delicious and meticulously prepared. They are tapas style so don't expect quantity but definitely quality. Cocktails were creative and based off of various comic book characters. Each drink was artfully created and not only looked but tasted great. Eleni was attentive and readily available to answer any of our questions despite being the only bartender making drinks for the restaurant while we were there. No, this place isn't cheap but definitely worth the experience. We will be back the next time we visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"There is a cocktail on the menu called \"Rarely on Target\" - that's also the review for this restaurant. Your time is better wasted rewatching Attack of the Clones."}
{"text":"In the high end, Yorkville, restaurant environment you need to be creative to stand out and Figures definitely does this. When you first walk in the door, it looks like a small little hobby shop with a cool collage mural and it's not until the hostess presses a button to open a hidden door to reveal the rest of the restaurant. From that point on, you keep discovering new things, from the imaginative artwork on the walls to the Pacman inspired ceiling lighting and more. You almost want to walk around and take in every piece as if it's a museum (but I don't think the other diners would appreciate this so much!)  The cocktail menu was divided into traditional and modern cocktails and I was able to try a few. As people have mentioned, this place is clearly not a place you go for cheap eats and drinks but the cocktails were boozy, well-balanced, and included a lot of premium and interesting ingredients I like to see in a cocktail menu. I would actually say they were great value for the price.  The dinner menu is \"small plates\" style and so our waitress suggested we order a few. I loved the beet dish and tried the Kobe steak as well because if you're going to go all out for fine dining, you might as well, right? It was everything people say kobe beef is; I could cut into it like butter and the flavours were amazing!  I should note I was also very impressed with the service throughout my experience. The way the bussing team quickly and discretely attacked the table to clear items, crumb the table, and reset fresh cutlery for every course was truly impressive as someone who works in this industry!  All in all, I truly enjoyed my experience! The price point means that not everyone is able to enjoy it every day but if you're planning a special occasion or want to treat yourself, Figures is certainly one of the most inventive new restaurants in the city to do this!"}
{"text":"Very cool entrance to this place and the comic theme with the art work is amazing.  It's like a speak easy concept.  Food and service is good, dishes are tapas size so need 2 or 3 per person and it's a little bit pricey in my opinion but worth a try."}
{"text":"Big Lame. This place will be gone in a matter of months. Let's start with the stupid ropes and the multiple front people. What is the angle?  Why do you need security for an empty restaurant at 630 in Yorkville?  It's like the owners went to LA once and are trying to replicate.   We went at 630 because we were told it was fully booked. When we left at 830 the place was basically empty...on a sat night. They didn't have a single full seating. They had the thick velvet drapes at the front but then had no coverings on the other windows, so it felt like you were in a night club for the staff meeting. So lame. The extra light made it easy to see how they had cobbled together the design. Mixing different looks. The benches at the front didn't even match.   The crowd was sparse. A couple of families bringing star wars fans. A couple of tourists. Our table was trying to have a fun meal before a concert...we thought it would be a great place to kick off a sat night out, but in the end spent most of the meal balking at the lack of confidence the place had.  It was like you were seeing the 'pilot' and they were hoping to be 'picked up' - like they were trying it on for size but it didn't fit.   I ordered a dirty martini. Was told 'we literally don't have the ingredients for that' and 'we only work with fresh ingredients so no olives' which is code for 'we are contrived and uptight and lame.'  I then tried to order the first cocktail on their menu and it was 'sold out'. Ick. The wine list was a farce. First the waitress awkwardly tries to push some wine on us telling us it is 'on special'. Then there is a tiny selection of whites. All over priced and no sauv blanc under 90$. Give me a break.   The food was pretty good. Carrots and beets especially. Not sure how the food and the theme go together. Agree identity crisis.  Small portions. Left hungry. Wait staff could hardly explain the menu. Oh and give me a break with the foam- it isn't 2005 anymore!  So clumsy and the front of house manager was more worried about napkins than the lack of good wine.    Most annoying, other than the total lack of vibe, was the constant peeping from passer by. How does that work?  You go to all the effort to pretend your place is exclusive and then you then every passer by pop their head in to 'check it out'. So lame.   It takes more than a theme and some spray painted figurines to make a concept restaurant work. I would bet the partners on this never fully agreed on the vision and will be closing soon. I will give two stars because they were trying on service and some of the food was tasty and that location is cursed so I feel bed that they even opened there."}
{"text":"We, my husband and I,went for Winterlicious and we loved the place. Very unique interior design, and the dishes were hands down great!"}
{"text":"The one star is for the actual food and cocktails.  They were delicious and so kudos to the chef and the bar for this.  However, the rest of my experience here was the most incredible combination of disappointment, frustration, and bewilderment I've ever had at a restaurant.  I've never written any Yelp reviews but my poor clusterf*ck of an experience here has inspired me to start.   We went here for my friend's birthday.  We had a large party, and so I was informed by my friend that due to this, the restaurant was requiring us to \"pre-order\" our food in advance.  Ok fine, not a problem.  More on this later.   We were there on a Friday afternoon, about 5:30 onwards.  There were about 4 tables occupied other than our own when we arrived, and around 6 wait staff.  We ordered cocktails, which came out in a reasonable amount of time.  From there, this is where everything went downhill.  Remember the restaurant making us \"pre-order\" all our food?  It took a massive amount of time for the first dish to finally come out, almost 45 minutes after we arrived.  What's the point of pre-ordering food if we still have to wait this long to get it?  Our party was split into two tables, and for some reason they only brought food to one table and not the other, despite our repeated requests to divide the food evenly between our tables.    After the first 3 dishes were brought out, they cleared our plates and utensils.  I assumed they would quickly replace them with clean plates and utensils, but no, this did not happen.  2 more dishes came out and we had to flag the waiter down to inform him we required utensils and plates.   After this, they cleared just our utensils, and then once again I had to flag down wait staff to get us new utensils because more food came out but they never came back with new utensils.    We had ordered one more item, the octopus dish, but it never came out.    At this point we were at the restaurant for over 3 hours.  We just gave up on the octopus, and asked for the bill.    When the bill came out, low and behold, we were charged for octopus that never came.  But the waitress told us she wasn't able to take it off, so we'd have to manually subtract it.  With all the drinks on one bill, and the food on the other, we had to calculate the cost of what every person had to pay, with no help from the waitress who told my friend to get her calculator out.  While calculating payments, my friend asked the waitress for a few more numbers, to which she condescendingly responded \"Sweety, I don't know what you're confused about\".  She then went and came back with a new bill, one that did not include the octopus.  I'm not sure why they didn't do this right from the get go to begin with, instead of making us manually subtract everything.   Overall, horrendous service.  Long waits for food, dirty plates and utensils sitting on the table for 20 or more minutes, food items not coming out then being charged on the bill.  And lastly, an unhelpful and condescending waitress.   This place is trying to be a high end restaurant.  When I'm paying $15 per small 3 bite portion appetizers, and $20 per cocktail, I'd expect some kind of stellar service.  Instead I found the service didn't even meet the bare minimum.    What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"After reading about this place I knew I had to at least try it out.  First things first - is it cheap - nope.  Do you get big portion - nope.  It's tapas style restaurant on Avenue....so \"figure\" it out yourselves.  The front of the restaurant is where the hostesses are - it's covered in comic book wallpaper and have action figures on shelves.  You go in through the \"hidden\" door that the hostess opens up for you by hitting the shield.  Inside is more lounge like than restaurant.  The wall art is amazing - apparently the gu that was commissioned to do it is colour blind.  IT's quite impressive.  Look up at the ceiling - you'll find some interesting old school art there as well.  The food menu is broken down into 3 sections - veggies (from the Earth); seafood (from the Ocean) and meat (from the Land).  Our group ordered several items:  - octopus salad (so good);  - oxtail with plantain chops - delicious that we ordered it twice - the lamb shank - nice and tender, not too gamey  - beet salad - while good you only get 3 thinly sliced beets - I would pass on this - the pasta - nice and creamy  - the eggplant dish - wasn't a big fan of this one - save your $$$ for the seafood/meat options  Because we were running late for another event we didn't have time for dessert.  The cocktails were delicious - Diablo Blank and I had the Bramble Bee.    I'd come here for a drink and a bite to eat and a dessert.  if you are hungry hungry I wouldn't come here and expect to be full (unless of course you don't care about $$$$).    I'll definitely come back again!  They bring your bill along with a comic book (that you get to keep)!"}
{"text":"If you don't want to starve avoid this place. Unfortunately this place doesn't  even deserve a 1 star rating, it should be 0.  A weird entrance and incompetent servers, you would expect 5 star service when you pay for an average check of $75 per person but nope, you get a newbie at our table and another server who could not calculate our bill after overcharging us.   We went to FNL Rom afterwards and to be honest they had better service than here, food was cheap, alcohol was cheap. I spent $20 and it filled me to the max. Spend $75 dollars at Figures and you will only be starving to 10% full."}
{"text":"Came into Figures for the first time, was pleasantly surprised. The food special was amazing, cocktails were very good, but most of all the service was impeccable. As the night carried on they transitioned into a lounge vibe, which includes a DJ and more of a party atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Bit of a style-over-substance situation over here.  Decided to try out this interesting dinner spot at Ave and Dav...'interesting' in the sense that it has an amazing comic book shop-type-thing at the entrance. But despite the Yorkville prices and stylish interior, nothing I tried really blew me away. I had such high hopes for the TV Dinner (fried chicken, honey, whipped mashed potatoes, creamed corn) which was served in an adorable TV dinner-like dish. Points for presentation. But the food was nothing special. Black truffle risotto was also disappointing...kinda thin, not a whole lot of flavour going on. Was hoping for something more rich, more truffle-y. Likewise, the cones for dessert were presented beautifully but the flavours were lackluster. Guess I'm spoiled with a premium spot like Hotel Gelato around the corner from my house.  The best dish of the night was definitely my husband's \"Oxtail Pancake\" with grilled pineapple and scotch bonnet romesco.  Anyhoo, overall it missed the mark for me...but the entrance was fun and the interior was slick. Try it and decide for yourself?"}
{"text":"The food is great. Typical tapa bar, service not so much. Really slow wait for tapas and to get the bill.   Server also spilled a drink and dropped a plate. If you're looking for a good customer experience you're going to have a bad time.  Don't really like the comic book gimmick at the entrance with people trying to sell you overpriced comic book collectibles and the brief warning of no photos allowed indoors for the decor.   Really weird vibe overall. Fire alarm also went off for a good 5 minutes and they didn't even give us complimentary drinks for that.  Also didn't even have a flash comic at the end. Lame!   P.S. This review was written in the time frame for waiting for our bill to come"}
{"text":"This has by far become one of my favourite restaurants in the city.   I guess I can start with the fact that the owners are obviously kids of the 80's much like myself and have a great collection of figures and toys for sale at the front when you first walk in. I only wish I knew my castle greyskull was going to be worth $500 I would have held on to it, but that has nothing to do with the food lol.   You walk into the place and there is a small store like setting and the hostess, she gives you a brief disruption of the front and then asks you to hit a button, now I think it should have been a Bat Symbol versus a Captain America Shield but that is just the DC geek in me coming out.   Now once you enter the actual restaurant it is beautiful there is art on the walls that I wanted to buy, the place is outstanding from the Starwars art to the large pop culture mural to the Pac-Man inspired neon lights I was in heaven.   The waiter was great and he told us about the cocktail menu that has several drinks all inspired from a specific character. I won't ruin it but they are all very good a little pricey but hey if your not ready to spend money then this isn't the right restaurant.   The food was outstanding the plates are designed for sharing so don't expect large portions. We ate the Duck, the steak and the scallops, all of which were perfect. Now I am not a fan of duck and I usually would prefer anything else to it, however the waiter told me to just try it as it's one of the best dishes they have. It blew me away I loved the hint of citrus with the duck and it was perfectly cooked with a ton of flavour.   I already booked my next visit and I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"After seeing the video on Facebook I shared it with my friend and we bookmarked this place to come down while at Fan Expo and that's just what happened.  After a long day of walking and standing around at Fan Expo a cocktail and possibly a bite was needed before heading home to Buffalo. Looking online, possible Open Table my friend saw that there were no open reservations but possibly we could get a seat at the bar. After the typical drive through Toronto we made it to our destination. Conveniently parking is right next door and with a ton of Canadian change I gladly filled the meter.   Walking in you'll see a non descript exterior, they do have a sign and some gold painted dolls in a case. Walking in you'll see a great wall of comic wall paper and their \"store\". My friend apparently didn't watch the video and when asked if we were ready to enter she started to walk outside opposed to hitting Cap's shield. As the door opened you are suddenly aware of the different ambiance.  Guests are asked to NOT take pictures of the walls or decore however more than welcome to document food and drink. Walking past the Star Wars display near the entrance I loved the Millennium Falcon and Death Star againt a mirrored space and above the bar there is a Pac-Man scene which sadly wasn't lite.   After glancing at food and drink menu we opted for only a few cocktails. To start I enjoyed the Malificent, a dark and stormy cocktail with activated charcoal. Served with a blossom and half a lime set a blaze with a brown sugar cube and absinthe. After blowing out her witchy magic I poured what's left into the drink to enjoy. Malificent, like her name sake can be deadly as you do not taste the alcohol inside.  My second cocktail was a Johnny Blaze and although not a whisky drinker the curiosity of tobacco smoke infusion couldnt be passed up. I found Johnny smooth, balanced and the hint of tobacco really compliments the blend.   All in all I appreciated the experience however am finding a lack of authenticity in the comic cover to this high end restaurant. The comic \"shop\" covering the restaurant is more small display than shop and isnt a space you'd hang out in to browse comics or collectables. Behind the wall, besides light decore and cocktails you wont find a heavy influence. This space seems more niche than serious comic enthusiast especially since they had no plans around Fan Expo.   Overall our experience was great,  the bartenders were a great team. Extremely friendly and courteous, they both were well trained in the mixology trade and personable enough that we didn't feel uncomfortable sitting there for about an hour."}
{"text":"A hidden lounge that is a comic based bar. Entrance is bright with comic related designs but you press a button to get into the secret cave. Inside is dark with loud music and more comic decorations. Food is ok, drinks are ok but cheap ($50 per bottle). Music is ok. Crowd is a bit weird. It's a very broad spectrum of people."}
{"text":"This place is undergoing an identity crisis. Upon entering the first door the hostess asked me if I knew where I was and told me it was a comic book shop. I told her I had a reservation. She asked me if I wanted to buy anything or take a photo. I answered no. She asked me again if I knew where I was. This process repeated several times until another hostess showed up and informed me that I was actually in a comic book shop with an 'upscale restaurant in the back' and asked if I had a reservation. I told her I did. She opened the door to the 'upscale restaurant' and lead me inside.   The first thing I noticed was the strong smell of sewage. The second thing I noticed was how many empty tables there were in the room after seeing the hostess turn away two couples at the door. Between the smell, the cheap looking decor (think ceiling-to-floor velvet curtains mixed with superhero wall murals and video game themed light fixtures), and the loud top 40 remixes played by the DJ, it was a sensory overload, and not in a good way.   This place is expensive. Cocktail prices are on par with Dbar - think $20 each. The one I tried was good - it came with a burning cinnamon stick on top, which I was grateful for since it provided a few seconds of relief from the sewage smell. The food was also expensive, especially considering how small the plates were. The waitress suggested five plates for two people, and with everything being priced between $20-$50, that adds up. I am willing to pay for the quality of ingredients and the work that goes into creating dishes but I found that for the food we ordered (we tried the carrots, pasta, octopus, oxtail, and pork) the prices were over the top. For example, the octopus was priced like it's from Buca Yorkville but it was a quarter of the size and consisted of one small tentacle on 'black garlic aioili'.   One thing to note is that apparently this place turns into a lounge at some point - I left at 9:45 pm on a Saturday - there were only four tables occupied and an abundance of staff. According to our waitress they were waiting for a 'big party'. Ok. The bill came with a comic book, which we were allowed to take home (no need to buy them from the shop out front, you guys!).   Does this place want to be an 'upscale' restaurant (and comic book shop) or a lounge that offers small plates? Hopefully the owner *figures* it out soon."}
{"text":"Just love this place! I had heard about the new superhero restaurant and decided to check it out when I was in town. I am always looking for something different and Figures did not disappoint. I am not a huge superhero fan but I really enjoyed how they pulled together the theme. The food was on the pricier side but definitely worth the money. I have a few food allergies but the staff did a great job with accommodating my needs. Also their drinks are amazing and I really enjoyed having them set one on fire for me. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the portions you get, and while the concept is interesting, the execution is like an art dealer's idea of nerdy fun.   Good service though."}
{"text":"Full disclosure I did not eat here. I had a reservation to which they f***** up and made me awkwardly stand beside a table for 2 when it should've been for 3. No one apologized and no one informed me that my table would be up shortly. Instead, I was told by the bartender to sit at the bar while I waited for my friends. It was clear because I was in jeans and a casual jacket whilst everyone else was in suits or a cocktail dress for a Thursday night, I was not a priority and was therefore outright ignored by the host and manager.  Furthermore, there is a reason why their menu is not online. Because 1) it probably changes on a weekly or daily basis 2) it is trying to be a speakeasy and 3) the prices are astronomically ridiculous.  My friend showed up, and was told they were talking to me about the little blunder that the ill-trained hostess had made. However, I was left at the bar alone with water, and no information about when my table would be ready. Seeing as I was handled poorly and the restaurant is clearly not as advertised I decided to walk out. And again, was never given an apology about their royal f*** up.   My impression of this restaurant was not what I had at all expected and due to the way I was poorly handled I will not be returning. any. time. soon."}
{"text":"Tried this place for our first Winterlicious. Overall, average food, novelty of decor will drive traffic.   I thought it would be more of a themed restaurant with the superhero experience integrated into food / drink / service but not the case. Apparently they turn into a club on weekends and that's when they have some superheros walk around"}
{"text":"Not much to say here. Foods not great. Small portions. Lousy drinks. Everything was way over priced. Cool concept but this place needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"Unique taste, beautiful presentation, good quality, excellent service, and great entertainment!"}
{"text":"Food was flavourful. It took 45 minutes for our food to come out. I told the supervisor on site about it but little compensation/customer service. A good try... But I probably won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Stopped by this spot for dinner while visiting toronto for the weekend and I have to say I was not disappointed! I dont know why this place doesn't have higher ratings but I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience here.   The restaurant is comic book themed when you enter and you press a cute button to enter a back room.   My friend and I started off with their cocktails, specifically the bramble bee and the Johnny blaze. Both very good (for our specific tastes) and presentation was on point. As for food we ordered the truffle frites, truffle wagyu burger and oxtail on plantain pancake. There could have been more truffle on the fries but they were still really good if you like a thick cut fry with a crispy exterior. The wagyu burger was overall good but I wish it was cooked more rare to really get that fatty wagyu flavor. The oxtail pancake however was the real winner and I would DEFINITELY recommend it to anyone visiting. The sauce was delicious if you like spice and we even asked for extra. We would have ordered dessert but were super stuffed from dinner.   The highlight however of the night was the impeccable service. Our waiter was always making sure we were well taken care of. When we asked for recommendations he was more than helpful and even got the GM to give us a bunch of recs. Thank you Owen for going above and beyond with making sure we felt welcome in Toronto with a whole list of spots to check out! :)   Definitely recommend this spot and will return next time I'm back in toronto."}
{"text":"I'm a Yorkville regular and this spot is a great addition to the neighbor. Great wine selection, pairs excellently with their menu."}
{"text":"Super cool place. The restaurant and bar are hidden behind their wall that's decorated by an artist with pieces of comics and graffiti. The cocktails are interesting but they're around $17-$20 per drink. The food was expensive and not that great. It's a fun place to be in but everything else was meh."}
{"text":"Great place to dine and stay for the lounge portion as well.  I like the vibe with the DJ, drinks and cocktails.  Went last week on the long weekend so wasn't too crazy and came back again this past Saturday and it was insanely busy.  Loved coming through the shop at the front to enter a secret restaurant.  Second time coming here this month and the menu changes frequently which for me is great because I live in the area.  Cocktails favs are Rarely on Target and the Maleficient.  Favs on the menu are the Beet, Oxtail and Kobe.  This place is very much a cocktail bar and have some good wines too.  Great for large parties and sharing."}
{"text":"The latest Yorkville restaurant, Figures, brings the beloved world of comic books and fine dining together to create a rather unique and memorable experience. From the moment you walk into the lobby, you're greeted by walls plastered with pages from comic books and shelves full of collectable figurines for sale. If you were to just pop in from the street you would have no idea that a restaurant was located behind the masked comic door. Once you're inside, you'll witness the elegance of an upscale lounge combined with walls and decor of your favourite cartoon characters and superheroes.  After admiring the murals and the eye-catching Pac Man light installation on the ceiling, it's time to look over the food and drink menu which is unfortunately not featured on the website. They like to keep it a secret to allow the chef to change things up by incorporating seasonal ingredients. That way, you're not always ordering the same old dish every time. It also allows patrons to have an open mind when it comes to ordering and perhaps venturing outside of the usual go-to dishes.    At first glance of the cocktail menu, the drinks seemed to be expensive ($18 to $20); but after ordering the Maleficent and the Bramble Bee, I understood why. Both cocktails created by mixologist, James Bailey, pack some real punch and contained an abundance of unique and delicious ingredients. I love how each cocktail is named after a comic book inspired story or character such as the Stormtrooper cocktail, 'Rarely on Target'. How clever!   Next up was the food menu. Executive Chef, Ron Stratton, has created an inventive seasonal menu divided into three categories: earth, sea and land. The dishes are meant to be shared, so 5 to 6 plates would be sufficient for two people . We tried a few dishes from each category:   Beet three ways with Deep Fried Chevre - $14  Lobster Claw, Salad & Caviar $38   Octopus Escabeche Salad with Black Garlic - $20   Cherrystone Clams with Fava Beans and Kathi Lime Broth - $16   House-made Fettuccine with Chanterelles & Macadamia - $22   Oxtail, Plantain & Red Stripe - $18   Lump Crab, Watercress, Old Bay - $26   Poached Pears in Red Wine with Red Wine Sorbet   White Chocolate Brownie, Rum Soaked Banana \"Spring Roll\", Ice Cream - $14   My favourite dish was definitely the Lump Crab. It came with a cold crab salad underneath the cake which had lots of tender and juicy crab meat. The crab cake itself was spectacular. Very flavourful! I also really enjoyed the Pasta Dish and the Oxtail Dish. Great depth of rich flavours in both, which made every bite so scrumptious. My least favourite was the clams, they were a bit too chewy for my liking. I also didn't care for the white chocolate brownie, although the banana spring roll it came with was very good.  Restaurant owners Patrick and Nader Marzouk (&Company Resto Bar) really brought their love for comic books and cartoons to life by instilling it ever so precisely throughout Figures. The comic-theme really made the dining experience feel laid-back and casual which is always welcoming especially when in Yorkville.   Figures is open for dinner or late night bites with music from their resident DJ. The restaurant is located at 137 Avenue Road in Toronto and the hours are Tuesday to Saturday from 5:30 p.m. to 2 a.m."}
{"text":"My friends and I came in the other night for late night drinks. They accommodated us perfectly with a table and bottle service. The staff and management were amazing, we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Obviously an interesting place to go! The staff is amazing, very accommodating and courteous. Prices are not cheap and portions are small. But the cocktails are unique:) should try!)))"}
{"text":"Specialty Drinks are expensive here, not sure why ..they didn't taste very good..   The food expensive but tasted awesome. Only thing that pissed us off was that the portions were so tiny!!! we were still so hungry after our meals which were $30 each.."}
{"text":"Except for our fantastic server who was very apologetic we had a terrible experience for their 'intimate' New Years Eve celebration. Overpriced small portions, inconsistent food quality, some was great some was horrible! We couldn't get out of there fast enough after the dinner service! Our group  spent over $2000 on food and drinks yet we were  told we would  lose our table because they opened the doors to the public and needed the space?!?! Wow, talk about a horrible decision by management!!! For $125 a person there's far better NYE options in the city."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Amazing environment, food, and overall a fun place to be. Staff is friendly and helpful as well. Atmosphere is different from other restaurants/lounges I've been to."}
{"text":"A restaurant suited for superhero, comic, and pop culture junkies. The 'lobby' is small with velvet ropes. The walls covered in pages from comic books. It literally feels like you're trapped in a comic book. Upon going inside the restaurant is dark and packed with people. We are escorted to our table and cannot take our eyes off the walls. All the walls are covered in paintings representing superheroes, comic characters, and popular culture icons. Every time I glanced up I saw new images and details. Unfortunately, you are not allowed to photograph the art. It was very tempting but of course, I held off.  I've seen a lot of pictures of their cocktails on Instagram but decided to get something different. The waitress recommended the Zombie Punch for 2 as she said its flammable and no one has Instagrammed it yet, her words.  I, of course, heard the word 'zombie' and 'flammable' and I was in. For our mains, the waitress explained that the menu is meant for sharing and 4-5 dishes would be perfect for 2 people as the dishes are small. The menu is divided into 3 sections; From the Earth, From the Sea, and From the Land. We ordered the fairytale eggplant, beet with chevre and truffle, Pasta (Carrot gnocchi), Coho Salmon and the Lamb Shank. All 5 of those dishes were OUTSTANDING! Each dish composed of small elements with rich and smooth textures. Cheers to the chef on an outstanding menu.   I had an incredible first experience and it will definitely not be my last visit. The food and atmosphere were incredible, the only complaint I can think of is that I wanted more! Each dish is prepared with such elegance and attention to detail.  The food, atmosphere and overall execution of the comic book theme transformed a regular night into an exciting dining experience."}
