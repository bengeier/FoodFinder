{"text":"I was very impressed with a quick lunch I had here with my buddy after we decided it was a good mid point to meet. We had lunch but the named goods on display ensures I'll be back to try those. I had the BBQ Korean Taco and my friend had the lamb burger. The consensus on both was excellent. The decor is pleasant and welcoming and the staff follows suit. It was a rainy day so we ate upstairs which had plenty of seating. On a better day, I would be tempted to eat outside. I'll be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"We were going to stop just for a butter tart because they are outstanding. I didn't know that they had a gelato stand set up outside. Amazing lemon gelato! Light texture and good tart flavour. Then decided to have a crispy chicken wrap and coffee. The wrap had crispy chicken with Caesar dressing, BBQ sauce, and lettuce. It was ok but nothing spectacular. The coffee was quite good for drip. And the butter tart was as delicious as I knew it would be.  We sat outside at the tables out front to enjoy the wonderful weather. This spot is very popular and on a weekend there are a steady stream of cyclists.  There is a great selection of baked goods as well as prepared and frozen foods. Goodwood is far from trendy but this place is definitely a gem and worth stopping at."}
{"text":"I come usually here when I do a long road cycling ride with my friends. I'm glad they're open even on public holidays and have a big bike rack parking available.  There's upstairs indoor and outdoor/patio seating available - and it gets pretty busy during the morning when other cyclists come here to hang out. Staff are very friendly and they bring out the food once it's ordered.    The place is a bakery with breakfast/lunch available.  For breakfast, I tried their eggs benedict - which are cooked to the right perfection and with good portions.  For lunch, I tried their classic sandwiches - which you can choose to mix and match with what they have available for that day.  Overall Annina's is a very nice place to swing by, even if you're not in road cycling.  It's very clean, cozy and friendly service."}
{"text":"Annina's Bakeshop is as good as it gets. The bakery is a popular destination for cyclists and any time during the warmer months you're likely to find quite a few people dressed in spandex. So if that doesn't bother you or if you have a secret fetish, this is the place to be!  :D   During the warmer months there are several tables placed outdoors, so that gives plenty of room in addition to the already pretty decent sized top floor.   Huge variety of delicious pastry! Good coffee! Amazing sweets! Super friendly staff. In comparison to some similar places in Toronto, the place is reasonably priced.   Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great place ! !  Awesome  pastries, but I  have  to  try it for lunch  and  breakfast  also!!"}
{"text":"Goodwood has one traffic light, a gas station with a Subway restaurant attached, a gift shop and Annina's. However this little jem is always busy and speaks volumes to the quality of its baked goods. Its recently renovated sitting area located upstairs is modern and clean. I come here often since it is our local joint but I am not bias, really I am not. The chef and owner is classically trained and I understand that he use to or still teaches cooking at a nearby college. The food is familiar with regular breakfast items, sandwiches, wraps and salads. All done exceptionally well. But the real draw is all the fine baked goods from staples like butter tarts to croissants to cakes, pies to breads. This visit we went for brunch.  I had a great breakfast sandwich, with bacon, eggs, lettuce,  tomatoes on a great heated bun for under $5. My older son had peameal bacon with eggs and great home fries. The other son had 5 pancakes with whip cream and strawberries.  All awesome in taste and price."}
{"text":"Annina's is cozy, warm, and delicious. Located Northeast of Whitchurch-Stouffville, it's the perfect restaurant to drive to whether you're coming from the GTA or are a local, as you pass rural landscapes of farms and rolling hills.    We came here after hearing good things about Annina's from my aunt's friends, so one sunny afternoon, my aunt and I decided to check it out.   Annina's has a large variety of baked goods - from butter tarts, mini pies, and cookies to brownies and apple pie pastries.  They also have a menu suited for breakfast, lunch, and early dinner offering items such as soups, burgers, salads, sandwiches & wraps, and pasta. My aunt and I ended up ordering a Skor butter tart, a couple of milk chocolate cookies, a grilled chicken sandwich with bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and a chipotle type sauce, and coffee. We took our baked goods and coffee to their upstairs dining room while my aunt waited for her sandwich to come (they bring you the food if it isn't ready to serve right from the counter).  On our way home, we bought more baked goods for the rest of the family - a regular butter tart ($2.95ea), a mini strawberry rhubarb pie, a mini blueberry pie (mini pies were $4.50ea), a raspberry-filled glazed cookie, a Skor cookie & another milk chocolate cookie (cookies are $0.75ea/$8.50 dozen), and an apple pie pastry.   The store also sells baked breads (made in-store), condiments (dressings, mustards, pickles, honey, jams, etc. ), and has a fridge & freezer section for meat pies & quiches, etc.   The food is very yummy - butter tarts are sweet but not so crumbly, which I appreciate. The cookies are nice little treats and the  mini pies are great - not overly flaky, a bit tender, and filled with flavour. My family really liked their apple pastries and my aunt enjoyed her chicken sandwich - it was pretty big and filled with fresh ingredients. I really enjoyed the coffee they serve - smooth and well-roasted.   Service here is friendly and helpful - the server was good with recommending different things to try out and was patient with us the whole time.   The upstairs dining setting is really cozy - it's a dining area split into sections where there are booths, lounge chairs and tables, a counter with seats, and regular tables big enough for 4-6 people each. The upstairs area can probably hold up to 20-30 people. In the summer, they provide outdoor seating (not upstairs, just outside near the front doors).   I definitely recommend Annina's - whether you're passing by, on a road trip, or want to make it here as a mini day trip, Annina's baked goods, coffee, and foods are delicious and perfect for any day."}
{"text":"Mmm... Delicious strawberry rhubarb pie. It's tart but full of strawberry goodness. If you like it sweeter, it's perfect with ice cream. I loved all by itself.  Pecan pie was good. Mind you, I was never a fan of pecan pie. I love pecans and I love the pie crust, but something about the goop in the pie I don't like, but this one is good. Not too sweet and it doesn't get stuck to your teeth.  I stocked up on a bunch of meat and dessert pies, so I'll be trying a few more over the next few days.  Getting here, don't follow the directions on their website (I ended up at the wrong place). Make sure you are at 300 Hwy 47, GOODWOOD. Stoufville (according to the website) will take you further and you'll never find it. Luckily a customer at McD's knew what I was asking about when I asked for directions. Easy to miss, but it's worth the adventure.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pie's done the right way!  I usually don't eat pie, because good pie crust is hard to find, and Annina's does it just right! The pie crust is not too think or too thin, it's crisp and has a nice light taste that compliments and doesn't overpower the real and fresh blueberries in the filling. The crust is NOT oily, greasy, pasty, soggy or strong tasting, things I hate and usually why I don't eat pie.  The interior of the bakery restaurant is very clean, including the bathrooms, and there is plenty comfy seating on the second floor. Outside in the well kept garden are a bunch of tables and chairs and some shade. To accommodate the dozens of road bikers who frequent the place on weekends there is plenty of rack space.  Next time I'm going to try a chocolate pie and some of the food off the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection of fresh parties in an out of the way location. Totally worth the drive.  Try the all beef sausage roll, seasoned beef in flaky puff pastry. Cinnamon meringues, Linzer cookies, crescents. All the classics plus mini pies and decadent cookies. A must visit if anywhere near Uxbridge.  Did I mention that the service is outstanding? Friendly smiling faces carefully packing delectable treats."}
{"text":"The pastries are fantastic, especially the butter tarts.  Nice little place to have a break out of the city and worth the drive."}
{"text":"A staple to not only Goodwood but surrounding towns. Excellent to walk in and eat. And amazing catering services! Busy but worth it! A must try for everyone"}
{"text":"What a cute casual stop in the country for fresh made goodies. We went today for Mothers Day sand thankfully had made a reservation so we scored a table inside. 10 minutes in rain erupted all over the outside diners.  The upstairs loft is a great space with nice windows. Clean. Service is casual - they will take and deliver orders, you pay at the cash downstairs.  Lots of yummy treats. Off menu grilled cheese for my kid - homemade bread with lots of cheddar Scallop tacos were very messy but good Pulled pork on waffles mixed reviews. The bite that I had was delicious, but they weren't temperature hot. This was a special. Veal in a bun was large and enjoyed I had the squash and pear soup which had just a hint of curry. This was yummy and very filling. I also had the special, a delicious arugula salad which I could not finish because of the soup.  On the way out we stopped at the treat counter. Let me just say how awesome the chef was. First my father asked if there was lard in the pies because he wanted to share with a friend with pork allergies - no lard. While he was there I asked about egg in the pies - Dutch apple no egg but the others are sealed with egg. Now this is where awesome comes in - he offered if we call ahead next time that he is happy to make double crust pies without egg for my kid to try. Oh, we will be back again!"}
{"text":"Customer service was a 5 really helpful girl helped me navigate their menu but the food was a 3.  I had the pork tacos and mushroom soup to dine in.  Then I took home a blueberry pie and a frozen Mac and cheese.  The first meal was good but the Mac and cheese was over cooked and had no flavour.  The pie was OK.  I would try this place again but I'm not going out of my way to hurry back."}
{"text":"Busy spot at noon on a weekday. Eat inside or out in a shady tabled garden. The very fresh (including thankfully the outer wrap itself) jerk chicken certainly packs a bit of a wallop!  I just bit in to the mammoth pecan butter tart and it is perfect. If ever again in the area I will be back."}
{"text":"Yesterday I went with my cousin for lunch.  I haven't been before.  I really liked it.  I took home a muffin and it was delicious.  I had a salad for lunch there that was very good. I highly recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Pies! Tarts! Cakes!  It may be a bit out of the way for some of you but it's worth the trip if you love tarts or pies!  Discovered this bakery today as we were passing by Goodwood.  I can't believe all the different flavoured tarts...maple walnuts, butter pecan, chocolate pecan, lemon, apple caramel and more!  The tarts are amazing!  We also bought a Chicken Pot Pie to go and baked it tonight and it was the best one ever!  It was filled with chunky pieces of chicken, baby carrots, peas, corn and potatoes.  So so good!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wanted to rate them higher but service was not good & found some of their products were on the oily side. No kid friendly items on their food menu.  Disappointing because it is on the way to my cottage and i have 4 kids. Baked goods are ok, but food leaves a lot to be desired and there is no consistency for taste, presentation or quality. Also on the pricey side."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. I personally like the eggs Florentine. OMG just amazing. The eggs are done to perfection. I have had the Seafood fettuccini.. that too was just spectacular. The bakery itself contains many amazing desserts. This place is full of cyclists at the weekend and is always quite busy. It is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Annina's Bakeshop has excellent baked goodies. I highly recommend their butter tarts which are quite sizable and have different flavours!  Aside from sweets, they do have breakfast/brunch offers.   The upstairs area is quite spacious but can get really busy on weekends.  They also carries condiments, frozen entrees/soup/appetizers that are made in house. Great to pick up some for entertaining at home.  Worth stopping by if you are up in the area."}
