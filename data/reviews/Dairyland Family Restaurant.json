{"text":"This place charms the hell out of me. It's friendly with a familiar old folksy decor. The problem may be that other reviewers don't know a whole lot of stuff about stuff. What I know is that the food is good with big portions, the place is always clean (this aint really a greasy spoon my folks) and the service is EXCELLENT and friendly. Only downside is they aren't open later."}
{"text":"it's like most other \"family\" restaurants that aren't chains. their menu is almost too big. they've got everything from spaghetti to eggs to butt steak. and they can't seem to spell omelet consistently.

i've only had breakfast items; usually two eggs scrambled with a slice of american and a bagel. their hashed brown potatoes are really just smashed up spuds, so if you're looking for the shredded kind, you'll be disappointed.

they're always refilling your water or coffee, and the food comes out quickly even when the place is packed.

meat-eating companion would like me to point out that their biscuits and gravy \"suck\". they use a chicken based gravy with bits of sausage over some toasted floury things that barely pass as biscuits.

but, they're cheap! which is why their regulars are in the retirement zone."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Friendly staff. Great service and delicious food. Poached eggs cooked to perfection. Delicious fruit cup with fresh fruit: grapes, pineapple, cantaloupe. Nice choice of bread. Nice variety of foods on the menu. Many types of omelettes with great flavor."}
{"text":"So, this is about what you'd expect when you think of a greasy-spoon diner: Nothing fancy. Nothing gourmet. Just basic, simple food. Skillets. Sandwiches. Meatloaf. Quick service. Lots of retirees. Always packed."}
{"text":"Horrible. Sad, tired, low-end joint with food that is just not good. No redeeming characteristics. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Breakfast is very good. Dinners are ok nothing fancy but... very fast. Always feels like we are family when we go there."}
{"text":"Bad service and even worse \"food.\"  I'll never go back while in the area.  I'd rather eat McDonald's or at some other fast food place - they offer about the same number of \"healthy\" options. 

They get 1 star because of all the adorable old people there.  Other than a hospital/old folks' home - I've never seen so many walkers and oxygen tanks in one place!"}
{"text":"Very solid greasy spoon fair. I've been twice for breakfast (in the afternoon) and have come away completely satisfied each time. Service was excellent and you can't beat the prices. The ambiance is grand-folk friendly and if you don't have a problem with that, you'll be good to go."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times, I like to go for breakfast on a Saturday morning. The food is your typical diner food, good and affordable! The place could be a little cleaner, though."}
{"text":"Great classic diner. Went for breakfast and it was exactly what you'd expect. Giant menu full or breakfast dishes and classic diner food. They had homemade soups, homemade desserts, and looked like one of their specialities was fried chicken based on looking at what others around us ordered. Tried the homemade chicken wild rice soup and it was awesome. I ordered the Dairyland Farmer's Omelette Supreme- huge of course. It had tons of meat and veggies. My side was hash browns with cheese and onions. It was all very good. Our waitress was super friendly and we didn't have to wait despite it being 11am in a Sunday. Service was also very quick, great diner. I added pictures of the food the others at my table ordered because everything was good. Chicken fried steak, patty melt, eggs Benedict, and a strawberry crepe. I'm an eggs Benedict lover and so I tasted the hollandaise which was fantastic. Also, many of us opted for the homemade biscuit instead of toast which was amazing! Actually best biscuit I've ever had, I was impressed. Great experience, no complaints- exactly what we were looking for."}
{"text":"This restaurant isn't fancy but the food is great, have a wide selection, good price, and everything made by hand and onsite. If you are looking for good food without a lot of frills I highly recommend at least checking it out."}
{"text":"Ok, so Dairyland gets a really bad rap. I get it, it is small, simple, nothing special.  The service is good.  The food is decent. However, the place is not awful.  It is just your local breakfast place with food options under $10.  I had the ham and cheese omelette. Was it great?  No. It was a plain ham and cheese omelette. This restaurant reminds me of cute little hole in the wall breakfast places.  

It is very family friendly. They always have ample parking and can accommodate large groups.  Unfortunately, it just can not compete with some of its neighboring restaurants."}
{"text":"Years ago I loved this restaurant. Not anymore. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger and I had the veggie Benedict. Rotten tomatoes ruin your taste for anything. Then I sent the beni back and ordered a chocolate pancake which was also gross. It's pretty hard to make a bad chocolate chip pancake. Also the coffee was not good. We were, to say the least very disappointed. Our waitress was nice. Otherwise a complete waste of our money."}
{"text":"Best diner close to home. We always roll out of bed at 11 or so and head over here for breakfast/brunch on the weekends. Never have trouble getting a table. Most we've ever waited was 5 minutes. I used to always get the Denver omelette because it's delicious every time, but now I'm addicted to their country fried steak. The boyfriend always gets the corned beef hash!"}
{"text":"We had stopped in here on previous occasions for breakfast and decided to stop in again as we were going to be on the area. Or previous experiences had is enjoying this establishment, but not this time.
The food was bland, my wife ordered eggs over easy while my son likes them over medium, the waitress placed the food in front of the wrong person, the carpet looks like it hasn't been cleaned in months.
We were disappointed, good chance we will not be returning."}
{"text":"My grandpa loves this place!  We never think about going because it's all they way on the otherwise of town for us, but he's a regular, so that's where he always takes us.  It's always a pleasant surprise!  Great breakfast foods, but also lunch and dinner are good too.  Breakfast is served all the time so I normally just go for that anyway! Great waffles, chocolate chip pancakes, and crepes.  My dads favorite is the biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"Very good family diner,  food is very tasty and you get plenty. Not pricy, a very friendly host. All the staff is great, I have been going their off and on for years!
This really is a good solid diner, if there is a problem just tell them and they will take care of it. I have eaten here over a hundred times in the last 10 years. I consider myself a fussy eater and this is a great diner!"}
{"text":"Dairyland is probably a 1.5 star joint, and I debated between rounding up or down before ultimately choosing the latter. I went for breakfast on a Saturday morning after not being able to find parking at small dive up the road. The diner wasn't particularly busy, but it wasn't empty either. 

The menu is large but somehow didn't have a whole lot that sounded appetizing. There were some inconsistencies (like being able to get a short stack of some pancakes but not others) and no a la carte options. When you're indecisive, options like these are crucial.

I eventually settled on the carb/starch double-whammy of a Belgian (on their menu, Belgium, if I recall correctly) waffle and American fries - a truly worldly choice on my part. While not at all healthy, I knew it was a pretty safe bet. The waffle was exactly as good as every make-your-own waffle option found at hotel continental breakfasts, and the potatoes were cooked through but had barely any browning and no detectable seasoning. Warmed syrup in a small metal pitcher was dropped off at our table, but was somewhat off-putting with its thick skin on top that crinkled as you moved it around. 

My boyfriend got the chicken-fried steak with sausage gravy, and just thinking about it makes me nauseated. He enjoyed it, but from across the table the sausage appeared weirdly pink and closer to cut-up hot dogs than any sausage I've ever seen. Yuck.

While Dairyland does got some bonus points for their chairs being upholstered in a ridiculous cows-in-the-pasture print, they lose mega points for cleanliness. The walls at our booth were filthy. There were brown stains that looked like little kids had smeared their ketchup/syrup/soda on the walls twenty years ago and it never got wiped up. In general everything is just kind of run down and could probably use a good dusting/swipe of disinfectant. My mediocre meal would have been fine on its own, but the creepy-crawly feeling I got while eating it kind of put a damper on the morning."}
{"text":"Perfectly good all-American diner-type breakfast offerings (sadly, no oatmeal!).  No surprises,  coffee served immediately and always refilled before you run out.  Popular with the old-folks for sure.

Not the kind of place I would pick for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This is quite the average \"small-town\" diner. It has the basic all day breakfast. The first time I came here was mid morning, and I got the country fried steak. It was a tad more..  ah.. done than I like it. Slightly burnt, but still edible. The second time I came was mid afternoon. Got the veal parmesan and the sauce was good, the veal had an extremely good crisp coating on it. There was a literal piece of cheese (mozzarella slice??) on it. I didnt like that and ended up scraping that off. This place has a bunch of older folk here. Which is fine. Eh. Overall food is a 4/5 for what it is. Decor?  2.5/5. Its has small 200 person town diner decor."}
{"text":"Perfectly ok restaurant in the breakfast-specialty mode. My kid has tried several of the soups--they look really good and truly home made. Can't miss taking the old folks there. They will love the endless cups of coffee and great service. Nice people."}
{"text":"Just found this place today. I only got French toast and sausage but ended up eating a piece of my moms sour dough toast with some strawberry jam. VERY good on my end. My mom got an omelette and my dad got pancakes. Their pancakes are plate sized, btw! Staff was super nice and checked on our table when necessary. Inside the diner is nice and cute. 10/10 would recommend! Btw- their incredible food is very affordable. (:

Update: went a second time, got waffles with strawberries on the side. Incredible. My mom ate my leftovers and loved it too. Got sourdough again too- loveeeeee still."}
{"text":"What did I just eat?

I'm not 100 percent sure.  I've been all over America and I've had sausage gravy over biscuits just about everywhere.  I've been down South and had amazing sausage gravy.  I had really, really good sausage gravy at a Motel 6 in Custer, South Dakota (no lie!).  I've had passable sausage gravy and biscuits all over this great land of ours...but what I just ate at the Dairyland Family Restaurant comes nowhere close to being sausage gravy and biscuits.

The gravy itself was passable as gravy.  Lifeless and sad, but gravy.  The biscuit chunks in the gravy was where things start to go awry.  They were all uniform in size and shape (warning!) and they tasted not like sausage, but more like something that was killed out behind the dumpster last night.  Maybe it was raccoon sausage.  

The biscuits themselves are where the whole train truly derails.  They actually served that slop over freakin' Pillsbury, out-of-the-can, cook 'em yourself at home biscuits!  That, my friends, is unforgivable.  If I want that crap, I'll stay home and cook it myself.

On the plus side, the service was good.  The eggs were fine.  And the Pepsi I drank was sweet and perfectly carbonated.  

The decor of the place looked straight out of 1985 and desperately needs some updating.  

The price would be reasonable--if they had given me decent food.  At the price I paid for what they gave me, I feel a tad overcharged.

I'm not going back.  Madison is a big town.  You can do much, much better."}
{"text":"Best food ever!!! Their deep fried cod is awesome!!! Their eggs benedict is divine. Highly recommend going. Lots of food for a small price"}
