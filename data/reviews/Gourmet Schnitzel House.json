{"text":"Found this place by accident and man one of the best schnitzel I've had, and amazing super friendly owners.  I had their mushroom schnitzel on rice, so delicious and not greasy or dry. My husband and daughter had their cabbage rolls with potato and it was a hit with my picky daughter.    The owners are so friendly and helpful.  It was such an amazing dining experience!!  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Over the summer my wife and I sampled all of the schnitzels and found them both moist, tender and wonderful.  But the Goulash soup was fabulous."}
{"text":"The owners are absolutely lovely and provide good food with friendly attentive service. The house schnitzel was delicious as was the dessert, a palacsinta (crepe filled with apricot jam). The atmosphere is warm and like being with family."}
{"text":"Loved the cabbage rolls served with sauerkraut and sour cream just the way I like them best. They were savory and delicious. The schnitzel on the other hand I found to be a bit dry. The red cabbage and the cucumber salad were also great. The service was a bit slow and I found our seating cramped. We had made a reservation and were put in the back corner like we were meant to wear dunces hats. I did not like that. The prices are reasonable. The parking was limited. We almost did not get a spot but then maybe the little street plaza was just super busy that night. My friend had the goulash soup and found it to her liking. We have decided it is more of lunch than dinner place. They no longer make the potato salad which is disappointing. We were partially headed there because it was listed on the menu and few restaurants carry it these days."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews brought me and my family here when we were nearby. Being eastern European, we're very familiar with goulash soup and schnitzel. My parents were very impressed with the goulash soup and the serving was plentiful in size(easily enough for two). The schnitzel kept us impressed with a full plate serving and its good taste. The price value of the food was phenomenal and we'll likely come back for more. Worth mentioning is that this is a family restaurant."}
{"text":"I had been here a few years earlier when the kids were really too young to enjoy a restaurant. This return was much better. Food is authentic not just typical. With a family of six we tried most of the dishes. Portions are all very generous. Easy to split a main between two adults so we had a big doggie bag. Paprakas was wonderful. Schnitzels were great. Disappointed that the German potato salad has been discontinued. Hunter schnitzel was different than I have been used to but delicious. Same with the mushroom schnitzel. Didn't have room for dessert. Good service and atmosphere. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite places to grab a quiet dinner in the fall and winter, with the warm and welcoming service pairing nicely with the freshly prepared food.  Their schnitzel is light and never greasy, with thin cuts of either pork or chicken that are paired with other home-cooked delights.  BF prefers their Corvina schnitzel with mashed potatoes, a massive schnitzel covered with a sauce of tomatoes, peppers, and onions and melted cheese.  My favourite is the Cordon Bleu, stuffed with ham and swiss cheese, paired with fluffy rice.  Don't miss their tomato, feta, and olive salad to start, and if you are feeling really ambitious, you can't go wrong with the palascinta (try the sour cherry ones) or home made apple strudel for dessert.  The portions are so generous, many times I just cut everything in half for another meal.  The BF sees the Corvina as a challenge, so he tends to rise to the occasion.  Come hungry or be prepared to take food with you!  They are licensed and have a nice selection of imported beers to wash your schnitzel down.    Clean, and casual location perfect for a relaxed dinner.  Parking is limited in the plaza but there is always ample amounts available right on Kingston Rd."}
{"text":"Had found this place on Yelp I happened  to be one block away! What  a absaultly fantastic find. Was not busy when I went in around 8 pm It is a small very clean establishment I take it owned and run by husband and wife. Ordered Chicken Schnitzel dinner with rice. Wow the portion was huge fried perfectly and sooo tender and flavorful I had too force myself to finish. Hands down the best Schnitzel I have ever had. Service was exceptional  they now have a new regular.  Think I will try Cabbage Rolls next visit."}
{"text":"Homey, quaint family run restaurant that serves simple tasting schnitzels.  Came here for dinner on a Friday night and it wasn't busy at all.  Most of their business I would assume come from the locals doing take out.  I came here specifically for their schnitzel which I ordered one of the most expensive on the menu, the Corvina ($13.95) which comes with rice or potatoes.  It's like veal parmigiana except it's a breaded pork cutlet, deep fried and smothered with a tomato sauce & mozzarella .  The taste was what I expected and I was full afterwards.  If you're looking for over the top complex flavours, this place would not be for you.  Sometimes simple tasting food is what you're in the mood for then come give them a try.  And if you're still not full try their homemade apple strudel or palacsinta, Hungarian crepes.   Plenty of free parking in the lot and if taking the TTC, grab the 12A Brimley from Kennedy station & get off at Sharpe street & walk towards the Tim Hortons, it's right next to it."}
{"text":"Small restaurant serving authentic Hungarian schnitzel. The schnitzel was crispy and not greasy at all (they drain it vertically). The portions were generous (we had to get a doggy bag) and the service friendly.  Although I wish that there were more vegetables served, we enjoyed our meal and will return."}
{"text":"We decided to go there on Saturday evening, the place is open only 5 till 9 on this day.  The place was not busy, only a few tables were taken.  I was disappointed that bread was not served while we waited for our meal which took about 30 minutes to table from when we ordered.  The server was attentive enough although he was not talkative or offered any information about the menu.  I am half Hungarian so I was able to decipher the menu and offer my companions my suggestions.  I ordered the pork schnitzel with mushrooms.  They ordered the chicken schnitzel.  The portions were huge, offered with either rice or potatoes. My pork schnitzel was good although I found it a bit bland.  I am formerly a chef and half Hungarian, so I make schnitzel from time to time at home. There could have been added a bit of garlic powder and paprika to the breading.   I found that my friend's chicken schnitzel to be tastier and moist and tender!  There was no menu item offered with optional gravy although they did have a Hunter sauce(tomato based.)  The mashed potato was excellent however my companion said that his rice was dry.   Although the portion was more than adequate, I would have liked a coleslaw, or small salad or perhaps a beet salad or a seasonal vegetable with my meal.  The salads offered were a bit pricey.  For dessert I had the crepes, which were okay however a bit doughy.    Parking was limited and no disability spot was offered as I use a cane.  The prices on the menu were reasonable and not expensive."}
{"text":"AVOID; do not recommend!  We came with a party of six around 7PM-ish on Saturday night.  They had maybe 3-4 tables and we were seated promptly; then it just went downhill from here.  We waited about 30mins for our menus but only two people were working at the restaurant (one eastern european woman and a silver haired guy with glasses)  He brought over cutleries, menus and took our drink orders.  After about 1.5 hours, we assumed it was taking longer because it was six of us but I noticed the woman yelling at the guy in the kitchen and fighting.  We were getting really hungry after 2 hours of waiting so I walked up to ask how our food prep was going.  As I was walking towards the server, I noticed the food coming out for the table that arrived perhaps an hour later than us.  I inquired what was going on and she started attacking me saying our orders were complicated and since the other table made reservations, they served them first.  Our orders were not complicated since their menu is very simple - just schnitzels; and I've never heard of that before where making reservations meant your food comes out first as well.  At this point, I told her that she was inappropriate to treat customers differently,  and I heard her saying \"fuck that table\" in the kitchen to the silver haired older server.  I didn't realize until the moment that she was talking about us.  She did not apologize once for the terrible service but the older guy apologized for what happened as we were walking out.  If the owner is reading this; you may want to ensure that your future patrons do not experience what we did.  In the case the owner is that rude lady; your terrible attitude towards your employee and customers was deplorable and I sincerely hope you do not continue your behaviour."}
{"text":"Excellent Schnitzel with ham and cheese and was thoroughly impressed. Paprika on mashed potatoes! Definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"Great local spot for some delicious home cooking.  Portions are HUGE and fantastic for a hungry family.  We've always gotten take out (never eaten in).  Great for when you're craving comfort food."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem: schnitzel house. Had this homemade goulash soup. Yummy! Looks like what we had in chinese food, lol. I  usually don't quite like deep fried food with batter. But this rocked! Very first time had this Eastern Europe dish schnitzel, not regret! The batter was so greatly done, not greasy nor dry. It was very crispy and nice. Personally I think the seasoning was just right. Not like most fried food I had that is salty. This is a big piece. Halfway through I need some soup or drink or salad to finish it. But that may be  just me, because I am not used to such a big chunk of deep fried food.  Owner told me this is a German or Poland dish, so I guess it is Eastern Europe style! Meat and potato? Lol. I know one of my coworkers would love this.  Good job! I didn't have enough cash (only debit or cash) so I had to give up the dessert, which looks yummy! Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Went with the family on a lark. We wanted something different and this fit the bill.  My wife and children had the Chicken Paprikas - the portions were huge and the kids managed to split just one order. Delicious.  I had the Corvina Schnitzel - it was amazing and it did not have the dryness problem most schnitzels have. It was tender, tasty and made me happy!   Then I had the apple strudel (get there early or on non-busy days to get this as I understand it sells out). It is a traditional version (not what you get in stores or commercial bakeries). Wow - this was great and reminded me of strudel that a small local place used to make (they are sadly retired now :(   ). The strudel was made in house and used apples with the peel on. Loved it.  Would recommend for those people looking for an unpretentious atmosphere and some great home made food (cooked for you when you order)."}
{"text":"Very nice family run place. Great schnitzel. overall very tasty and inexpensive.  Worth checking out.  Gonna be back next time I'm in the area. Maybe check out other items"}
{"text":"The nice owner/server at Gourmet Schnitzel House asked me \"Who sent you here?\"  \"Yay! My Yelp Friend sent me here..........\"  He probably realized something fishy going on, when he saw me walked into the empty restaurant alone at 2:30 pm looking for food......  House Schnitzel with Potato ($9.95) - The dish is garnished with a lemon slice and potato salad as in traditional Austria Schnitzel - The meat itself though I found it a little dry and not as tender as I would expect... the batter though flavoured was a little on the heavy side - It was a struggle to try cutting up the schnitzel due to the toughness of the meat  They were out of Apple Strudel which is the usual dessert I would have ordered, so I ended up having   Palascinta (crepes) with Apricot/Plum ($4.95) - It was just Meh... - The crepes itself is the more doughy and was pre made, all they did was just put the filling inside - The apricot one was not bad, but the Plum once was just overstuffed with fillings all I tasted was the sour Plum...  Maybe I came in during their down time as they don't really expect anyone to be ordering food? The owner though really nice, kept asking how my food was.... can I tell him just read my Yelp review?  The parking lot is pathetic... but there's free one hour parking right on Kingston Road after 9 pm... so parking should not be an issue.  2.5 star"}
{"text":"Schnitzel Mecha? (I hope I didn't offend) I consider myself a schnitzel aficionado. I thought I knew everything, and then I discovered Gourmet Schnitzel House.  I'm going to have to come here a lot to fully explore the menu, which is extensive.  Its quite well priced, family friendly. The Goulash soup itself has caused me to start a new list.  Its way off the beaten path for me. But I'm so pleased I stopped in."}
{"text":"Do not recommend at all!! We had schnitzel  there, a very thin layer of meat excessively breaded! He charged us $10 per bottle of urquel pilsner as if you are having a drink at times square! Owner was very indifferent upon our arrival and could care less for the customer service, try it yourself if you dare!"}
