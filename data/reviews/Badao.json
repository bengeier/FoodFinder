{"text":"Really good noodles and large portions... maybe it's changed since the previous reviews. Gave us a lot of free tea on a cold day."}
{"text":"overall very disappointed and most likely wont return again..1.superrrrr small portion compare to most noodle places--their bowls are super wide but very shallow..can finish the small ones in 4-5 mouthful; 2. ordered the spiciest one but not spicy at all; 3. chef probably forgot to put salt; 4. on the pricy side considering the portion; 5. not many selection on menu...."}
{"text":"Just opened has some potential but Kind of bland it seems they just dump a lot of pepper in the broth.... most times on the menue were not available"}
{"text":"Updated review: 
I was expecting more honestly, they need to look back and determine what is the issue, i have tried to come back here 3 times and waited for a very long time each time. The food was a little bland and the portions small, the prices were not reflective of the quality you received. Overall, it is a shame but if they choose to improve i will come back"}
{"text":"Really homey tasting Chinese food. I had the cucumber salad and it was spicy but refreshing. Steamed dumplings were good as well. I had the braised beef noodles as my main at level 1 spice and they were SPICY so keep that in mind. Today is the Dragon boat festival (???) so as per Chinese tradition we had Zongzi (rice dumpling) and it was on the house!! Service was prompt. I really enjoyed this experience. Portions are good and the prices are really affordable. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Spare Rib noodle bowl. I went on a Saturday and this bowl was 15% off, so of course I had to get it. Badao was not crowded at all, so we were seated quickly. Our food came out within about 6 minutes which was very impressive. 

You can choose the spice level for the bowls! I chose the least spicy (I have a fairly high spice tolerance) but this was still pretty spicy. 

My only complaint is that the water cups were so tiny. For a spicy dish, I would've loved to have a large pitcher of water on demand! Otherwise, the service was great and the ambiance was very relaxing and quiet. 

This was a classy, yet affordable dinner. 
I recommend eating here, but I would honestly ask to have a full pitcher of water (not sure if that's possible, but I would try to!)"}
{"text":"A new Chinese noodle joint around Guy.

Came on a Wednesday evening and it was very quiet but cozy. The menu is simple and small. Me and my friend ordered the braised spare ribs hot noodle soup, which you can choose your preferred spicyness level (note: they make their spices stronger than most places). The small size of the noodles looks more like a snack, while the large size is a normal meal size. 

The broth wasn't as rich in flavour than it was in spice, tasting almost a little watered down. The spare ribs were delicious, however you don't really get much as they are about 5-6 small pieces with bones and 80% noodles. The dumplings were cold and not as flavourful, but their stuffed pork buns were delicious but again small. 

Overall, the food was okay with decent prices."}
{"text":"Excellent Ramen and very professional service. 
I took a Very very very spicy Ramen with beef. it was delicious! I recommend!"}
{"text":"Mistakenly walked into this place instead of the ramen beside it. It's a cute place for just noodles. There are two levels, we sat on the second level; which was pretty cozy. I felt bad for the waiter have to go up and down for orders, drinks, refills. They need to manage that better for employees and customers as sometime there's no one serving due to waiter is busy downstairs. 

I like the noodles; the texture is good, better than most noodle place. The broth and varieties will need improvement; not much choice, they are pretty spicy even for least spicy and they somewhat taste the same, just different toppings. We ordered the cucumber and beef (Don't remember) appetizers. They are pretty good! The small size for noodle is relatively small imo for its price. I have to get two smalls which is more or less equivalent to a large in price and quantity. 

We wanted some dim sums. But they were sold out. Either they are very popular or they are under prepare. A little bit disappointed. 

I am unsure if we will go back. But it's something to try once at least!"}
{"text":"This was the first place I went to my first night in Montreal. We wanted to go to some place close to our hostel and this place caught our eye. I got a noodle broth bowl with spare ribs. The server told us that they had a discount for that dish today, which is why I ordered it. The food came out almost instantly which surprised me. We also got a complementary tiny salad and a cup of tea with our order. The one thing that I would criticize was that the cup they gave us for water was really tiny. The dish I got was relatively spicy which meant that I needed a refill pretty routinely, but the server wasn't always readily available. The food overall was pretty good and for the price I think it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"The last time I had to add salt to something was when I was 12, when I added salt to my friend's glass of water while he wasn't looking.

Crazy lines in the first 2 weeks of opening, but it's much quieter now. Badao has a small selection of dishes, which makes it seem legit.

For starters, we ordered a side of spicy cucumber sticks. Salted, spicy, and has good crisp. Not bad.

I went for a braised pork noodle soup. The noodles had great texture, and absorbed the soup really well, but the soup itself was watery. In fact, I typically complain about things being too salty, but this one was bland to the point I added salt for the first time.

But salt alone wasn't enough to save the soup. After adding a quick dash of vinegar, distinguishable flavours started to come out. I still believe they could have made a tastier soup, especially since they have broth from the braised pork that they can add to the dish.

Also I think the meat could be fatter, or braised for a little longer, for some pieces were tough.

In terms of decor, the place is well lit and spaced out, so I would bring a first date here, and pray that she isn't a picky eater."}
