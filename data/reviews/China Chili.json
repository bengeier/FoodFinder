{"text":"Giving four stars to China Chili doesn't necessarily mean I think the place is fantastic -- but the spicy garlic eggplant is fantastic, and I'm still pondering its fantasticness hours later. My husband and I also enjoyed the rest of our meal -- yiu-shan chicken and one of the house specialties, black pepper prawns and scallops. Yes, I concur with other reviewers that some of the dishes are not gonna be fantastic. Still, I look upon the place as reliable, clean, moderately priced and efficient. I don't need P.F. Chang's."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. They somehow make green beans and tofu delicious. Miracles never ends.  
Their orange chicken is the best I've ever had (no hint of that nasty ketchup flavor you get a some places) and the sizzling rice soup...there are no words."}
{"text":"Not \"special\" but if you are a fan of the old school Chinese restaurants, this is a pretty good one. Fast lunches, solid menu, and fair pricing - this place is always busy and for good reason."}
{"text":"Excellent and interesting Chinese food! Its not fancy, but has a nice Asian ambiance,  and is inexpensive for sure. I've only been a handful of times and everything has always been delicious but this last time on New Years Day I had the szechuan prawns. Omg. Amazing!!!! Huge portion and the sauce was spicy tangy sweet and perfect."}
{"text":"Some seriously good and authentic Chinese food in Phoenix, of all places. Mapo tofu is pretty darn spicy and delicious. Their peking duck with steamed buns is perfectly cooked and cut for easy consumption. Plenty of delectable crispy skin. Check this place out, but don't expect any sort of endagered animal express."}
{"text":"Our go-to for Chinese ( which I don't eat often due to high sodium).  Always get the orange chicken with sauce on side to go.  Chicken always good- not overly coated and fried.  Sauce just enough kick.  Owners always friendly and on their game"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because a GIANT fly was flying around our table. We almost think it came out of the kitchen because I swear it appeared when we started serving ourselves. 

China Chili is great! The spicy garlic eggplant is so freaking good. The soup wasn't anything special, but is you order chicken they almost give you the whole chicken! It was more like a whole breast cut up into pieces as opposed to individual pieces breaded and fried and whatnot, so it is obviously more healthy... They give you a TON of food and the price is good. Huge place so you will almost always get a table."}
{"text":"Had a great meal!  The sizzling rice soup was very flavorful. Main course entrees were delicious, as well. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is very friendly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular at China Chili for over 10 years. Sadly once they moved to the new location on 3rd Street and Flower their quality has been deteriorating.  

Went recently for lunch and ordered the Mongolian Beef and Beef Foo Young and both were awful, no taste, no flavor and very sub standard.  The prices have gone up the quality is shameful.

I think that the Orange Chicken is possibly their best item right now but sadly did not have it.  Thought I would explore to other dishes but never again.

Not sure I will be back, possibly for lunch for the Orange Chicken. With so many other choices of Asian Food.. this local favorite has not kept up its quality."}
{"text":"Went here today because it was on the way to a destination and near by. I've been trying honey walnut shrimp/prawns at different places to see where I can find a favorite. I was by myself and made a smoothie for my journey so I didn't need a drink and planned to tip well because of it. Definitely got a weird look but I expected that.. The dining room is just a big open room and lots of white linens so it's very bright. The food came in a flash and was delish. The shrimps were huge and the batter was almost perfect, slightly mushy, but I liked it. I always ask for extra sauce to mix with the rice and it was a good amount. I'm kind of a stickler about rice, growing up in a half Japanese household. The rice was the best so far although still kind of dry but I can imagine because it's made in copious amounts. I asked the server for a box because I had about 6 shrimp I couldn't finish. The server brought the box  and offered to pack the food for me :). I declined nicely because it was only a couple shrimp.I asked for the check accidentally assuming he would have brought that too. After ten minutes I think he might have forgot, trying to make eye contact with other servers was difficult as they seemed uber focused on other things or not really wanting to help a solo eater such as myself haha. Eventually I got my bill and due to the tasty food and maybe for them to pay attention to people like me in the future I tipped well and left with a happy tummy. :) I will be back."}
{"text":"I was really craving chinese food today... too bad this place was NOT what I had hoped for. I ordered the orange chicken, fried rice, soup, and crab puffs. The chicken is dry and tasteless (on the menu it said SPICY however it is not spicy or flavorful at all). The rice has no vegetables or anything - it is just flavorless, oil soaked grains. The soup container was LESS THAN HALF FULL and smelled so wretched I couldn't bring myself to taste it. The crab puffs were decent, but not enough to make up for the 15 dollars worth of wasted food. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place gets packed easily, but I manage to be seated quickly. Drinks & Food are served at a fast pace! The food is amazing & really great quality! At the end, I'm very satisfied. I recommend this place to be one of the best Chinese Food around Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I've had in the phx area. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly, and the food was awesome. I'm glad I have finally found a good Chinese food restaurant. I will for sure be going back!"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place from my boyfriend so I had to try it.  I perused their menu and figured I'd try their famous House Special Chicken Lunch Special (included Sweet and Sour soup).  Since I also went there for dinner (serves food family style), I also tried their Orange Chicken, Sizzling Rice Soup (enough for 4 bowls), and a Shrimp dish (the name escapes me now) -- they were all *very* good.

While the House Special Chicken wasn't extremely spicy (for my taste), it was still delicous to me. :9  I wouldn't say their food isn't authentic Chinese, but it was definitely adjusted to make this place unique from all other chinese restaurants I've been to--which gives it a plus in my opinion.  I really liked how their chicken or shrimp dishes were tender and not dry.  Most places cook the chicken until it's overcooked.  They did a great job here.

I really enjoyed it here and highly recommend it for people who are bored of \"the usual\" :)"}
{"text":"My family and I go here all the time. Best place in the valley great Chinese food. Crab puffs are delicious, mongollion beef is awesome and the best lo mien! Defiantly a must try! Service is fast and food is a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I have been to China Chili a half dozen times mostly for lunch with co-workers.  Their food is consistenly good.  Wait staff are not very friendly but make up for it with sheer efficiency and quickness in taking your order and bringing your food. We have never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated without a reservation during crowded lunch times.
The restaurant decor is spacious and inviting reflective of Chinese art/culture; 
Two of my favorite dishes include: The Orange Chicken :  generous breastmeat  not overly breaded with the right amount of heat. Delicious. Spicy Green Beans with Tofu is another excellent dish with green beans not over-cooked and flavorful braised tofu that absobs the garlicky sauce.  I am not a huge fan of Chinese food, prefering instead Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese  cuisine which, for me, has more interesting ingredients.  But CC rates far above the other chinese restaurants I  have tried.

{"text":"Well, after hearing how wonderful this place is, my husband and I decided to give it a try. Our first visit was dine-in.  Food was average and service was pretty bad. Next evening we decided to try their take out. I ordered sweet & sour chicken with the sauce on the side. After picking up my order and beginning the drive home, I realized that the onions, green peppers and pineapple was missing from the chicken container. I went back to the restaurant and was told that the veggies were in the sauce (because I ordered the sauce on the side) to keep them crispy.  I said \"great\" and left.  When I got home, I opened my container of sweet & sour sauce and found 1 bite size piece of pineapple, 1 bite size piece of onion and 1 bite size piece of bell pepper!!  Won't be back..."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant if you're a fan of Chinese food.  I seem to gravitate around the spicey dishes, like chicken and beef.  On their menu, the spicey dishes have a little red chili pepper next to the dish.  Their soups are very good, too.  I tend to go there for lunch because I work near the state capitol, so I'm not sure what the menu looks like at dinner time.  The prices are very reasonalbe, but if you do go there for lunch, go early!!  The place really fills up, and there is not much off-street parking.  After noon time, there are always people waiting to be seated.

Years ago, this restaurant was located on Central Avenue in a little, tiny brick building painted bright pink in color.  They lost their lease in that former location, and the building was torn down, so they didn't exist for about a year and a half.  Finally, they reopened at their current location at 3rd Street and Flower.  I'm glad they returned!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! First time here we took my sister in law here before she leaves to China for 3 months. Food was really good! I will be back and highly recommend"}
{"text":"I have eaten in restaurant only a handful of times.  The service is friendly but lacking.  Now, I only eat here if it is catered at work and even then if I haven't brought my lunch into the office.  The vegetables are always overcooked, mushy and taste oily.  The chicken is always over done.  The beef is gristly and flavorless.  The sauces on the food, and the ones on the side, are gloppy and thick, often oily and often flavorless.  The egg rolls are small and greasy, maybe they need to drain them more before serving?  
The good parts:  I don't pay for the lunch when it is catered at work, but like I said...I still only eat this if I didn't bring my own lunch for some reason and the fortune cookies!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Phoenix hands down. The hot and spicy prawns are a must and so are the house chow fun noodles."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT orange chicken with just the right sweet and spice, crispy exterior, and whole breast meat. $9 feeds two humans, or one hungry American."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Not a fan of their Kung Pao Chicken though. Service was fast and friendly and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I wish there were half stars with yelp because I would give this one a 3.5.  While the food was pretty good, and the service was fast.  It seemed very frantic and pushy.  Good food just not the place you want to go unless you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Very authentic, reasonably priced. I am from 
Chicago and the interior and vibe at China Chili reminds me of Chinatown back home. I just love this place, I eat here 3-4 times a month."}
{"text":"China Chili is back!

It was gone for too long. Basically, China Chili has good chinese food, and is incredibly fast at getting it to your table. You could set your watch to how long it takes them. It would be scary if the food weren't so good.

Get the orange chicken (did I just destroy my credibility for recommending orange chicken? Probably. But just try it. For me. This ain't no Panda Express orange chicken.)"}
{"text":"I think as far as the food goes it's pretty average.  Have never been disappointed with the food but it's not \"great\" by any means.  What I do have a problem with is their service is TOO GOOD.  I'd like a few seconds after I lay down my fork to chew before you come and snatch my plate out from under me.  Servers are all over your table all the time.  I know they assume this is good service but to me it's annoying.  I love good service just as much as the next person does but it does not take 18 (yes I counted) visits to my table and 3 different waitresses to accomplish good service. You got to give them credit for trying but sometimes I think they try a little too hard.  My first visit I was impressed and thought \"wow what great service\".  The rest of my visits I have just found it overly annoying to have a server at my table 15+ times every time I visit for dinner. Slow down !!!! It's ok if my plate sits on my table for empty for 2 mins even 5+ minutes. Just as long as you eventually clear it BEFORE bringing me my check you'll have accomplished your job of good service.  But 15+ visits from a server EVERY time I've dined here is becoming annoying. I feel like I\"m talking to the servers more than my dinner guest."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars for one thing. Peking duck. Their duck is by far the best I have had at any American Chinese restaurant. The duck is steamed until cooked then it is flash fried in a wok to crisp the skin. The duck is then cut with bones removed and served with sliced green onions, plum sauce and steamed rice flour buns. I don't live in Arizona but when I am away I dream of Peking duck!"}
{"text":"Comida China chingona. Came in here on Friday night, busy night. Wait staff was friendly,  environment was nice, delicious food. Even though they were busy they were friendly and fast, only thing is I couldn't understand anything they say. Order the orange chicken- best orange chicken outside of China.  Don't mind the older gay crowd, they like comida China chingona too."}
{"text":"Came for dinner on weekday maybe 1 to 1.5 hours before closing, with the family when my uncle was in town visiting.  We ordered maybe 8-10 dishes and shared family style.

The majority of dishes I tasted were alright.  The vegetables and tofu generally tasted bland or overcooked.  The Mapo Tofu and Salted Fish fried rice were decently good.  

Near the end we ordered Orange Chicken, and that, was probably the best orange chicken I've had in my life.  Chicken was sliced thin with crispy breaded edges, and good/mild level of orange flavor.  So, if going I have high recommendations for that dish.

For the distance, I would probably not come back again, I'd get something more local that has better dishes overall."}
{"text":"I've driven by this restaurant for decades and always wanted to check it out..So took 2 of my friends there last Friday night and was not disappointed by my meal. The decor is very dated and it looks like any generic family run Chinese/Asian restaurant. The staff was attentive and friendly. Usually I don't order appetizers or soup before my meal but we ordered a large bowl of the egg drop soup which was very good. I ordered Singapore Rice Noodles and was very happy with the entree. All in all it was a good experience, my friends who went with me eat there at least once a week.  The best part is the food is relatively inexpensive, our meal was $32 for the 3 of us, you can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Moo Goo Gai Pan was good
Egg roll was ok
Got takeout
Price was right!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get Chinese food. I have lived in San Francisco and have had some of the best Chinese food there. You must try the szechuan prawns. They are one of the best dishes like no other and so very delicious, and my favorite when I eat here. I cannot say I am very fond of the service. They tend to move like stealth waiters, all of a sudden out of nowhere they are right at your side taking something off your table. It may seem like the are trying to hurry you out but I do not believe that is their intention. I just ignore them until I am full and ready to leave. One other favorite is the orange chicken
 I highly recomend them for their food."}
{"text":"I love China Chili. The food is definitely Americanized Chinese, but it's also delicious!

Around lunchtime, the frenetic staff buzz about delivering drinks and soups and entrees and checks. You don't really have a waiter as much as you have a zone defense! The lunch menu is consistently good. The service is very, very fast. Considering the large portions, the price is very good.

For dinner, the place is calm and quiet and very pleasant. And the dinner menu is enormous. You could probably eat dinner at China Chili every night for 100 days and not have the same dish twice.

Great for takeout, too!

Some tips:
-If you like Orange Chicken, you will absolutely love the way they prepare it at China Chili. Instead of small, battered chunks of mediocre chicken, they batter a whole juicy chicken breast and then serve that sliced and drowning in the orange sauce. I order this dish about 2/3s of the time.
-The Salt and Pepper Beef is very good.
-Chicken Corn Soup might be my favorite soup ever.

Anyway, now I'm hungry for Chinese food. Time to make a China Chili run!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good!  The interior of the restaurant however leaves a lot to be desired, it is very mauve & green. It is your typical Chinese food restaurant, and the servers are not overly friendly. They do however, provide prompt service. This is still the best Chinese food I have had in Phoenix that does not belong to a chain."}
{"text":"China Chili, is quite possibly, one of the best Chinese food resteraunts you'll find in Phoenix.  I've been to a couple of places in the Chinese Cultural Center Plaza (the closest thing to a \"China-town\" you'll find in Phoenix),  but I still am drawn to China Chili.  

There service is fabulous and the food consistent.   We started our meal with a Chinese beer and appetizers (potstickers, and Veggie-rolls).   The orange-chicken meal was fabulous and all the servings are for two, possibly three people (i.e. easily shared).  I also tried the Sweet and Sour Chicken....so tender and yummy.

We never feel rushed or packed in.  We were there on a Friday night and there was a steady stream of customers, but the service or experience did not suffer.  

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ate in and had wonderfully prepared scallops with spicy garlic sauce and the Hong Kong style crispy noodles.  Very authentic and delicious.  Close to getting a five star rating from me except for the limited beer selection."}
{"text":"Fair is fair, I wrote a terrible review for a Chinese restaurant last week, Now for something completely different...we were in Phoenix on a visit, and after last week's disaster at the Chinese buffet where the food was cold, tough, and tasteless, I figured we couldn't do worse...Yelp helped me find China Chili; with 154 reviews and almost all of them 4 or 5 stars, I figured it was our very best shot at a decent meal.

My standards for Chinese food are very high as I lived in San Francisco for 20 years and have been to China for the real thing; so don't take my 3 star rating as disrespect. It's really quite good, certainly the best Chinese I've had since I left San Francisco. 

Décor usually isn't an important part of the experience for me but China Chili is quite attractive inside, it looks small from the outside but was quite spacious inside. Despite being one very large room it was possible to have a quiet conversation. The lighting is quite relaxing without being dim,  and the décor traditional Chinese.

We had Hot & Sour soup, and were asked if we wanted it spicy; we did; it was. Really quite excellent, among the best Hot & Sour I've had. Very rich and full, I was surprised at the shrimp and chicken, which were perfect in texture and taste; the veggies were just the right crispness, the broth was spicy but not too hot, and all in all I really recommend this soup; my companion said it was his favorite part of the meal. He's from rural North Carolina and had never had it before, nor much Chinese. As for me, I'd come back for more.

Next up the Kung Pao Chicken was little disappointing, in that it had too little chicken, too much okra. But it's a minor point, the flavor was delicate and pleasant, the mix of other vegetables offset the okra and what chicken there was, was nice. Unfortunately it was not very spicy, especially after the soup, and so if you order it I suggest you ask for it to be extra spicy. But still a pretty decent dish.

My personal favorite of the meal was the Prawns in Lobster Sauce with black beans. Perhaps a little salty but the flavors overall were delicate, the prawns large, tender, and juicy and no hint of greasiness.

Last we had house special fried rice which was excellent, very fluffy and well seasoned, with beef, chicken, scallops and shrimp. Quite gingery which I like. 

All in all, while it's not up with the very best Chinese cuisine in San Francisco, the food and service were more than acceptable, prompt, unobtrusive, helpful and the price very reasonable, $40 for four dishes and sodas including tax; and the portions were more than generous, we took home more food than we ate (by intention). The Soup alone could have been half the meal...

If you're in Phoenix and you want Chinese, you couldn't go far wrong by choosing China Chile."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It smelled glorious as soon as we walked in. The servers were attentive and the food was delicious. We got the potstickers, veggie chow mein, and orange chicken.  The potstickers were perfectly cooked, steamed with a little bit of crunch. They were truly the best I've had and they were filling too. The chow mein was flavorful and the orange chicken was perfect. It had just enough breading to make it crunchy and had quality chicken. Note, you can get the orange chicken at different spice levels (mild, medium, and spicy). We went for the mild and it was perfect. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"The best chinese restaurant in the valley for the price. I highly recommend the half duck, walnut shrimp and house rice. This is our goto place now for chinese restaurants. My friends from the bay area love it too."}
{"text":"With a name like China Chili, you might expect that their food would be a bit on the spicy side. Especially the \"House Spicy Chicken,\" described on the menu as finished with a \"spicy garlic sauce.\" Why then, would it arrive without a hint of heat, and no discernible garlic flavor? It was like KFC and gravy with green onions. The sweet and sour chicken, sweet and sour pork as well as the fried rice, egg rolls and crab puffs - all unremarkable as well. The service is over-efficient to the point of annoyance, and like all Chinese joints, even the younger workers seem to go out of their way to be phonetically incomprehensible. All that said, it's cheap and fast and edible - and the portion sizes are very generous, so... two stars."}
{"text":"Still the best in town! Our old favorites remain the same and hit just the right spot when we are craving Chinese Food. Even if you don't like tofu, try the salt and pepper version. Jalepenos and a paper thin crispy crust surrounding the steaming hot custardy tofu is delicious!"}
{"text":"It is chines take out...  Fast good and cheap.

if you like Calimari, order the \"Salt and Pepper\" calimari.  It is fantastic 4 out 5 times and good 1 out 5 times...  I am addicted to it.   Ask for extra onions and jalapeños!

Everything else is good, and if you are in a hurry for take out, this is your place"}
{"text":"The food was ok and the service was very poor. The servers were rude and basically yelling \"excuse me\" at us when they say the food on the table. I had no idea she was behind me, she didn't need to be so rude. We never got enough silverware or soup bowls. We had to ask for bowls twice and the first server just walked off when we asked. Turns out they were right next to us, so she had no intentions of even getting them since she went the opposite way. I'm not 100% sure but I think my family and I got food poisoning from here. We hadn't been around my in laws before this and yet 24 hours later all of us got severely sick at the exact same time. Hard to imagine it was something else since we don't all live in the same house but got sick at the same time. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Just the worst chinese food ever. Lacks in flavor regardless of dish and the meat was just suspect. Asked other's if their opinion and the responses were the same. Don't do it. You will be disappointed that you didn't listen."}
{"text":"I found this place quite by accident, my friend was looking for a Chili's where we could meet for lunch.  She gave me this address and I was delighted  to find China Chili instead of one of the run-of-the-mill, not even Mexican food Chili's.  

I ordered the House Chicken and was given the choice of spicy or not.  I opted for spicy, it was delicious. 

So many people have complained about the decor, it was simple and to be honest I did not notice what, if anything, they had hanging on the walls, and I really don't care!  I'm there to eat and enjoy the company of my friends.  The food was great, the service was good considering how busy it was for lunch and the prices were reasonable.

I've recently relocated to Phoenix from the east coast and where I came from there was one decent Chinese restaurant in a 50 mile radius.  China Chili is better than the best my town had to offer."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks a little outdated on the inside but the food makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"Celebrating my mother in law birthday, thought this would be a special place to take her. We ordered 2 Mongolian beef. Food was served there was no visible beef on plate just onions and veggies, fried rice was ok. I told my husband at the end to tell the staff they lack beef. In response the waitress told my husband they didn't have enough beef for the second order so they split it...no offer to comp, no apology."}
{"text":"My friend called and wanted to meet for lunch.  I was at Salon Embellish, getting a cut from the awesome Dionne.  I was also on my bike, as per usual!  I did a quick Yelp search to scope out prospects in the immediate area that would be bike-able.  My friend agreed that we'd often talked about China Chili, so we agreed to meet there.  It took me 5 minutes to bike there; I beat my friend by 15-20 minutes.  There is a sad lack of bicycle parking; I ended up locking up to the fence in a designated fire lane.  Businesses with a bike rack automatically earn an extra star from me!

The restaurant is old-school Chinese restaurant.  It's very clean and comfortable.  There are parking and entrances in the front and the back, which is a big plus for a central city business.

We ordered the crab puffs, sweet & sour prawns, and pork mu shu.  We were satisfied with each of these items.  The menu is large and varied; I will most likely return again to try other items.  Located on 3rd St. in central Phoenix, this place is easy for me to access on my bicycle."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for kids and adults--a very extensive menu.  My biggest gripe is that like most Chinese restaurants, there seems to be a lot of variety on the menu but it comes down to about 4-5 different sauces with various combinations of fish/chicken/tofu/beef.  But the sauces are good, and the service is quick and efficient.  I would recommend the soups, Hong Kong noodles, and Peking duck.  All were really delicious."}
{"text":"DECENT LUNCH MENU. The interior is festive and well decorated. Its legit chinese.

My husband and I went here for a lunch date. The thing that was MOST impressive to me was the lighting-fast service. We both ordered from the lunch specials menu (which included and entree, rice, eggroll and hot & sour soup for about $7.50). As soon as we placed our order, the soup was at our table. Our drinks never ran low. Our main meal was out in about 5 minutes. It was FAST! 

The meal itself was good (not SUPERB, but good.). I LOVED the hot & sour soup. I tried the lemon chicken dish and my husband got the orange chicken lunch dish (both good. i liked his orange chicken better). I wish that on the lunch menu they offered some side dishes. -- i would have enjoyed some veggies or tofu options. None of that is listed on the lunch menu. It seems like the dinner menu is a LOT more comprehensive and offers more family style service, but i wasn't sure if they only offered that menu in the evenings, or if you could order from the dinner menu any time.

Good for a relatively inexpensive lunch meal. 
I would love to go back some time in the evening to experience the dinner menu. It looked like there were a lot of tasty dishes worth trying."}
{"text":"My first visit here was around dinner time, Christmas night. All things considered, we were seated within an hour. Really not bad considering how many other people were ahead of us and waiting. Standing room only is an understatement. Shortly after being seated, our waitress was ready for us to order. We needed a minute. She disappeared for a while and eventually a different waitress arrived. Again, Christmas night so no big deal. This place was incredibly busy. We ordered two appetizers and two entrees. Everything came out in a timely manner. My only critique was the appetizers were a little skimpy. I'm not sure if this is usual, or because they were incredibly busy. BBQ pork was especially on the light side. Other than that, No complaints. The Hot and Spicy Sichuan Prawns were awesome. Not what I call even in the same area code as hot or spicy, but delicious. We also had the Pillow Chicken which was a nice balance with the Shrimp dish. This is not the most authentic Chinese I have ever had, but I will go back again for sure if I'm in the mood for Chinese. Something tells me it won't be as chaotic."}
{"text":"On a Friday night restaurant was busy, but the service was top drawer. Food was very good and we will be back. Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Food was GREAT butttt the prices are high and you can't pay one dollar extra for fried rice you have to buy a whole separate order of rice smh."}
{"text":"This place is the best place to get Chinese food in phoenix! We do not go any where else to get Chinese food anymore. Food is fantastic and so is the service! If you say other wise you just don't like REAL Chinese food and have no eye for good service....Enough said!"}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty. No two dishes taste alike and they are always efficient getting orders together. I just wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"Service is fast! It's not luxurious but the food is good! They will even pack up your left overs."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. Food is horribly bland. I go there once every 5 years."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I got a mushroom soup and it was huge!!  It must have been the family size because the bowl was bigger than my head. The broth was so good though! I tried my friend's dish and it was really good, too. I would definitely come back. I need to try more food here to see if I should maybe give them 4-stars."}
{"text":"They do not use fresh ingredients, or at least they cook so badly to make it seem that way.

People must have to convince themselves that this place is good because it's the trendy thing to do. But you're better off going elsewhere if you want good Chinese food.

Here's a general tip for you guys: if the place isn't predominantly Asian, leave. That's a definite sign that the quality is sub-par. But if you're white and have never had genuine southern Chinese food, you'll probably just barely choke down your \"food\" and agree with most people that this place is decent."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times, first because of a recommendation of a friend and other times because people wanted to go here and I was dragged along. The food is underwhelming!  I've tried a different dish each time I've eaten here, and frankly, none were good.  I guess most of the people who give this place 4 and 5 stars are regulars at McDonald's."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that is more of a landmark than a fine dining experience, yet the food is always good. It's quick - at lunch time they have your entree out to you within minutes of order (usually while you're still working on your soup). It's reasonably priced - $8-$10 gets you soup, entree, egg roll and a drink, The lunch crowd is pretty faithful so if you get there after 11:30 you may have to wait for a table. Call ahead and pick it up if you ever have to order lunch for the office. 

I like their orange chicken, mildly spicey. And, I always get the most profound fortune cookies. Today's message \" Working with children has a miraculous affect on your spirits.\" Ahhh."}
{"text":"China Chili, we love your food, service and everything about this place,  it's fantastic!!! One request, maybe a little music in the dining room??? It makes a huge difference in the dining experience.. other than that don't change a thing."}
{"text":"I don't know if it changed owners or what but the service was slow and no one smiled.  When we asked to be seated at a round table for four instead of a small square one--- NO was the abrupt response and no explanations.  Very rude!  Also, there were only 4 groups of people there.  Not even half filled to capacity on a Thursday night around 4 pm.  Ordered the Mongolian beef And orange chicken. The orange chicken was disgusting and very sweet. Also the chicken was very dry and over fried where it was hard and tough.  Panda Express makes a better orange chicken!  Shame!  

The Mongolian Beef was OK , but it was swimming in green onions and white onions on top of a crispy white noodles deep-fried bed.  Disgusting!  The only thing that was good was the hot and sour soup and egg drop soup. The rice was not even jasmine rice used!  Will not be returning to this venue. Very difficult to believe that this was rated highly on KAET channel 8 on a show called CHECK PLEASE.  In the end, all I needed was my check.  Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and the food is pretty good. There are a million options for dishes and what I have had was pretty good. Its not the best Chinese I have ever had but definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"China Chili is good, but it was better before the city tore down the old little pink shit-hole building and made them move. 

The new space is much larger and I think the kitchen struggles to keep up. The quality of the food is not what it used to be, but Chinese is like pizza- even bad pizza is still good- and China Chili is the same way. The Szechuan green beans were disappointing- they were much too salty. The Mongolian chicken and the hot and spicy prawns are awesome, though. Those two dishes alone almost redeem the restaurant for any other misgiving I ever had about the place. 

The lunch specials are cheap and tasty, the service is quick, and the dining room has no problem accommodating large groups."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed after reading other reviews. Maybe what they had was good but I was recommended the house ho fun and it was pretty tasteless along with the house chicken. Tried to put chili powder along sweet and sour sauce (which poured out strangely watery) and to no avail. Wouldn't bother giving it a second chance but portions are huge and the service is really great"}
{"text":"i wasgoing to give this place a much higher rating until i read the latest county health score in the arizona republic on august  26, 2011. the restaurant was tagged with four critical violations, an unacceptable mark. just the week before, i was with a foodie group that immensely enjoyed the aromas and tastes of the various soups, appetizers and entrees we shared. and a large glass rotating plate in the middle of the large round table made it easy for us to try all the dishes we ordered. i enjoyed the sizzling rice soup. thought the corn chowder a bit bland. portions were enourmous, as were the shrimp in the dishes we ordered which included  fried rice, and a spicy sauce. two of the group ordered orange chicken. not a favorite of mine. but they liked it quite a bit. so, if this place can take care of keeping in clean, and maintain the high standards and ingredients they use to cook their dishes, it will be a top neighborhood hangout. but health comes first, and i will not be going back until i see the next score and hope there is improvement."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm jaded from all the places I've traveled to and lived in, but I honestly didn't see the big deal about this restaurant.  True, their appetizers are decent and the Hot and Sour soup tasty.  But the main dishes we had -- Garlic Eggplant and a half duck -- both very highly recommended by other reviewers, were mediocre at best.  I suspect most Americans wouldn't know \"real\" Chinese if they saw it  and this restaurant perpetuates the myth, that what they serve is actual Chinese food  (after bringing a friend to a Chinese restaurant off of Northern (Wahsun), which makes real Chinese food, he was shocked to taste what real Chinese food is).  Most of the dishes at China Chili are overly salty and/or sweet  (to be fair though, as a diabetic, I usually avoid both, so I might be overly sensitive on that point).  The service is indeed excellent and friendly.  My biggest complaint was the party of 15 Latinos sitting next to us celebrating a birthday, who apparently think it's okay to have screaming children ruin everyone else's night.  But that's not the restaurant's fault, since machine gunning guests is (still) illegal and there was nothing they could do about it.

In summary, the food here is okay, with the appetizers being their strong suit.  I've tasted much better in the Valley and don't really think this place deserves all the hype it gets.  Then again, there ARE a lot worse Chinese restaurants out here, so this may be your best bet.  It doesn't hurt either, that they're open till 10pm; a remarkable exception in a city, where the norm is to close at 8pm or 9, even on weekends and which, of course, is ridiculous for a \"major\" city.

I truly recommend \"Wahsun\" in Phoenix, if you want to try real Chinese food.  I think most people would be surprised to discover how very different it is from what they're used to.  The food takes some getting used to, but once you get into it, you'll never go back to China Chili or their colleagues."}
{"text":"Went to China Chile very recently with four friends. The parking lot was jammed and I thought, this place MUST be good!  Wrong!  I don't understand the stellar reviews of this place...maybe they save the good Chinese food for the dinner service?  Our lunch was just so so and that's being kind.  I ordered the 'special chicken' which was supposed to be spicy.  I ordered it medium and it had NO spice at all...very bland...certainly nothing special.  One friend had the lemon chicken...bland..so so.  The same with the Kung Pow chicken the other three ordered.!  BLAH!

 One friend was a few minutes later than the other four of us, and the server acted like she was just sooo inconvenienced that we couldn't order right away. When we did order, the food came out within 5 minutes!  We couldn't believe it!  It had to be precooked and warmed up...that's what it tasted like. 
I would never go to this place again.  There are too many good choices these days."}
{"text":"Seriously, people giving this place high reviews? When we went here last, the chicken was dry and had a burnt coating that slid right off. And it was somewhat temperate in the middle, confirming my suspicion that this was made earlier and then just re-fried, cut, and served. I don't think any restaurant should get any stars when they just open a can or packet (yes, I'm talking about the vegetables and sauces) and mix with pre-cooked meat. That IS NOT good Chinese food. As someone who has lived where there are actual Chinatowns (Boston and San Francisco), I know what very good Chinese food is, and this place certainly is not.

Oh, and the lighting. Who said that bright, overhead lighting creates a pleasant atmosphere for dining? 

I have yet to find a Chinese restaurant here in the Phoenix area that actually puts together fresh ingredients from scratch. If anyone knows of one, please let me know."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken! They use strips of chicken breast with a thin batter. The orange sauce has a tang to it. All-time favorite! I get take-out so I really can't rate the service but they are fast."}
{"text":"China Chili is the restaurant that Orange Chicken built.  While that dish is tasty, this place has so much more to offer.  Venture away from the lure of the Orange Chicken tractor beam and try such tasty morsels as:

Boiled Won Tons -- a standout dish; the spicy peanut sauce is more like broth than sauce, but in a good way
Chicken Corn Chowder -- a reliable standby
Honey Walnut Prawns -- deep-fried shrimp enrobed in mayonnaise with honey walnuts; what's not to love?
Lover's Prawns -- half the prawns are in wine sauce and the other half are in spicy chili garlic sauce; very balanced
Pillow Chicken -- along the lines of deep-fried chicken croquettes with savory Black Pepper Sauce
Sichuan Style String Beans (with pork) -- a fantastically spicy dish

The lunch menu includes a number of their most popular dishes (including Orange Chicken, of course) that are very tasty and wallet-friendly as they include a cup of the daily soup and an egg roll.

This restaurant is run by a large extended family and the place has a very convivial atmosphere.  The people watching here is great.  The customers represent a broad range of Phoenix residents and there are usually a few gay peeps in the house, which is always a bonus.  

The decor at China Chili really improved when they moved from Central Avenue due to the Light Rail.  This place doesn't have the decor of C-Fu Gourmet, but it is pleasant enough.  The enlarged dining room can now accommodate a crowd, which has really cut down from the long waits at their previous location that was so much smaller. 

Besides table service and take out, China Chili also caters.  The BF and I recently used them for our Tacky Tiki Gay Pride Brunch.  Johnny handles the catering and he's great to work with.  We asked Johnny to create an appetizer buffet, which was something China Chili had not done before.  They did a great job building a custom menu for us and the food was great.  I highly recommend their catering; it's a great way to feed a crowd on a moderate budget."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was young and they were located on Central, this is a geat place to have good meal family style. #RWJ"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by stating that I've only ordered take out. With that, China Chili is my go to place for those days where I don't feel like cooking and want a quick meal. It's the best mom and pop Chinese restaurant I've ever been to.

I'm a strict vegetarian, and China Chili has been very accommodating. I'd recommend the Hunan Style Tofu with no chicken. 

I'm not a big holiday person, so I'm looking forward to spending Thanksgiving and Christmas here."}
{"text":"Not to be mean but you other yelpers are f**king nuts.  This place is beyond mediocre.  I work across the street and have ate here many times including with co workers and vendors.   The food comes out about 30 seconds after ordering it.  The chicken mean is dry as all hell, get asweet sauce when i order kung pao, etc.   The only halfway decent part is the eggroll with the lunch special and the hot mustard is OK.  Overall if you think this is a 5 star restaurant well you are wrong.  Go out there and try some other places or go to the east coast if you have to."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good Chinese restaurant ever since my favorite Shangri-La location closed down and I've found it! Their food is so delicious and flavorful. I usually go for the orange chicken and the beef chow mein. I love how their orange chicken are sliced fried cutlets, I've never had it this way until now and I love it a lot more than the other places who make their orange chicken 90% breading and 10% chicken. I still haven't gotten around to taking my friends here yet, but whenever my boyfriend and I are craving Chinese food we always come here."}
{"text":"Always excellent. I reserve 5 stars for anything that wows me. I should give China Chili 5 stars because they're always reliable. It's a good good spot for transplanted East Coasters like me who like Chinese comfort food without an overgrease laden spoon. Love that they know how to pack mushu to go, no added instructions or confusion. Meat & seafood are always fresh, well cooked. Vegan dishes are just that, vegan. No muss, no fuss. The chef can make a dish to order if it's not available on the menu!!! We keep going back for: hot & sour, YuShang, Salt & Pepper, old standards. Their specials are great.  We always try a dash of anything different than what you can't get anywhere else and have not been disappointed yet. Overall very happy we found this gem in the desert!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Their portions are extremely generous, taste of food is great with the right balance between meat and veggies.

They give you a small cup of soup and an egg roll, service is fast and waiters are very nice."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today after hearing all the colossal raves about it. However, once I walked in, I realized that any semblance of having an authentic Chinese meal went out the window (no offense, my hungry white friends!). 

I decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn't going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I'm brown, people). Anyway, that's my issue.

The hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don't make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I'm more willing to give it 2.5 stars. 

So why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service. 

The waiter:

* noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star.
* is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will.
* When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with...\"oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano.\" Bonus points for knowing that.

Anyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I'll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn't mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous. 

All in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot. 

And there you have it."}
{"text":"Great Food. Usually a weekly or bi-weekly stop for us.  
They are there to please thats for sure. Never have to worry about your glass getting empty either. 
Maybe sometimes too fast. We've learned to order our appetizers and wait till they get to the table before we order our dinner so it all doesn't show up at the same time. But otherwise a great place for Chinese!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I spent 2 years in Honolulu and used to eat at this great little place in China Town. I have been craving that food since I got off the plane to move back to Phoenix. Well, I found China Chili and I am SO glad I did! The Honey Walnut Prawns are so  yummy! The fried rice and lo-mein noodles are smoky tasting, and hot out of the wok. Is it healthy? Maybe not. Is it non-greasy? Um... not really. Is it delicious when you're craving some really filling Chinese food? Yes. I wish it were closer to my place so I could have it more often, but I'm sure I'm sparing my waistline of more issues!"}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch if you are in a hurry. Tons of seating and minimal wait time. Parking is okay though you probably will have to settle for the street or dirt lot across the street. 

The portions are huge! I would dare say you could split a plate and ask for sides of soup and egg rolls. The kung pao is seasoned well with lots of veggies. It is made with dark chicken meat, zucchini, red bell pepper and carrot. The salt and pepper shrimp dish is great. The lemon chicken is very tasty as well. It has breaded pieces of white chicken breast fried crisp and served in a lemony sauce. 

The service is good though about five different waitresses will hit your table from beginning to end. Every time I looked up it was a new person bringing me soup, lunch, water, and the bill. Some smiled - some looked like they were really focused on the job at hand. 

Overall it was a good experience. We've done take out a few times and it is also quick and easy!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! And the staff is very attentive you don't have to call them over for a refill they are all working together and helping out. The food have such a great flavor very authentic and filling!"}
{"text":"Every dishes is China Chili is extremely good and delicious!I highly recommended the Orange Chicken,Honey Walnut Prawns and the Peking Duck!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant here in the Valley! I love the way they seat people, all along the wall to reduce noise. I could actually have a conversation without having to yell. The workers are respectful and quick. I have been there about six times, and each time I get the same thing because it is so good! Best lomein noodles I can find down here. There eggplant soup is amazing as well! I will keep coming here time and time again. The only con is the tiny spot they have for parking..."}
{"text":"The orange chicken is so good! It's not deep fried like usual so you don't have to feel so bad in eating it. The walnut shrimp was good but it was too sweet and fatty (sauce) for my liking. But I will defiantly eat here again"}
{"text":"I have gone there a few times now because friends have chosen it.  The food is ok.  It is very inconsistent on taste and the look of the meals.  Prices are reasonable for what you get.  Always seem to run into people I know there so others do seem to like it more than I do!"}
{"text":"Our go to place for Chinese food when we visit Phoenix. They usually have a good crowd of people. The soups at night are big bowls to share. We've tried the chow mein and the Mongolian beef. We like the broccoli beef too. The service is always spot on. Very friendly staff. They all help take care of all the tables."}
{"text":"Legit chinese restaurant with decent prices and hefty portion sizes. Service is lightning fast which is perfect for a lunch break. Your choice of entree includes a heaping mound of rice plus an egg roll for a side treat. Food was delicious enough for me to want to go back and try other dishes. For now, the Mongolian Beef and MaPo Tofu get my vote!"}
{"text":"The lunch menu is all 7.95. The Kung pao dishes are all great. service is top level. Awesome and consistent food top to bottom on the menu. I come here every year with my wife from Alaska. This is one of our mandatory stops while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times but I never reviewd it...it is good Chinese!  It is located on 3rd st just south of indian school rd.  It is a huge restaurant...in fact I do not think I have ever been in an authentic Chinese restaurant that is that large in my life...lol...there is plenty of parking on the side and back of the property.  You walk  in you are greeted by the hostess and they will take you to one of the many many tables...this place is always busy because it is very popular.  The servers are on it...they are used to getting people in and out fast because as soon as you sit down they are asking what you would like...didnt bother me because I like to get my food!  hahaha...they have great lunch specials for no more then seven to ten dollars...i like the kung pao shrimp...lots of veggies and the spice is pretty good...the house chicken is good and I enjoyed the mongolian beef when I had it too!  Once you order your food you will get it in like 5 minutes.  It is good food!  I enjoy it and I will be back!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant near downtown now they raised their prices and are charging for bland fried rice for lunch and the soup looks like a bowl of snot! I will not be back!!"}
{"text":"Only thing ive had is the Orange Chicken and white rice. Hands down the best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here a few times now with co-workers, and everytime I come, I leave with leftovers and content with my experience.

The service is great and fast (important for those on a time budget), the food is really good, I enjoy the Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao Chicken, and the prices are very affordable - $6 to $8 for the lunch special. 

It's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Temporal cooking at its best! I can't remember how many times I've ordered and the food was out before the water was... you definitely get a LOT of food for the price, and everything I have tried has been awesome."}
{"text":"so we wanted Chinese, and decided to eat at the restaurant. What awesome service. We started with the potstickers ($4.95). They were lightly pan fried. Perfectly chewy with a nice crisp on them. Wifey went with her go to dish, the amaaaaazing Singapore rice noodles with BBQ pork and Shrimp (8.95)  This dish is EASILY enough to feed three people. (yes, she brought most of it home) I went with the salt and pepper pork chops. If I could marry chinese food, this would be my bitch. Holy cow. Awesome thin cut pork chops breaded, salted and served with jalapenos and chives. I don't ever ever ever eat fried foods, but these were seriously one of the best chinese pork dishes ever. Overall, great great great. Super stoked that this place is right around the corner."}
{"text":"I have no idea how or why this place got such good reviews, but we went here specifically because it got such great reviews and we were so disappointed. The food is bland! Like, so bland that chili sauce, duck sauce, and soy sauce didn't even help. I ordered the Thai noodles and it would've been a great dish if it had any flavor or sauce of any kind on it, and my husband got the Yu Shiang chicken. He thought that the sauce was good but the bamboo shoots were undercooked and woody, and the dish was plain all around. Very disappointing considering that there are a huge number of Chinese, Korean, and Thai restaurants in this city that are much better than this place."}
{"text":"I saw this place has great reviews and wanted to try something new. I was completely  underwhelmed with the food. 

I ordered the teriyaki chicken spicy and the crab puffs. The taste of the chicken was gross. I thought at one point I may have gotten duck or something. Not good at all. The crab puffs were awesome.

I gave two stars for the exceptional service and cleanliness. I will not be returning though."}
{"text":"One thing I like about China Chili is they are consistent. Food is always delicious, the portions are big, and the service is fast. The first time I found China Chili via Yelp of course, was on my first business trip to Phoenix in June of last year (2015). Who would have thought that I would move to Phoenix almost two months later!! I work and live less than two miles from China Chili so yes, I am a regular patron now. Please continue to make the best Chinese food in Phoenix and remember that good customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"This place has been consistently wonderful every time I have eaten here. I typically order the sweet and sour prawns and the kung pao octopus and have enjoyed it each time. The thing to keep in mind is that the service is fast and they will get in and out promptly. Great lunch spot and great place to eat if you have any additional after dinner plans."}
{"text":"China Chili is very good, my favorites include the orange chicken, the pot-stickers, and the vegetable/or beef chow mien, and the chicken corn chowder. Restaurant is clean, and service is good!"}
{"text":"YUM.  

The Orange Chicken is great, the Salt and Pepper Shrimp, the House Fried Rice are all fantastic.  But I highly recommend the Dragon meal.  You get Hot and Sour Soup, Chinese CHicken Salad, Crab Wontons, Chicken with Pea Pods, House Fried Rice and Honey Walnut Prawns (Which I suggest you swap for Hot and Spicy Prawns.  They are neither not nor spicy, just reeeeeally tasty).  Best meal!!"}
{"text":"A bummer. We had dined at China Chili for several years, but the last experience was a disaster. On Saturday March 15th, my wife and I had dishes we'd loved before, such as chicken with sizzling rice soup and chicken in birds nest (chicken with vegetables with a potato chip like basket).

Within hours, I suffered severe symptoms of food poisoning. Without a day my wife did as well. For the next month, I continued to suffer severe gastrointestinal problems, and remain under a doctor's care. My wife was OK after a couple of days, but this was a nightmare.

This is direct cause and effect. I've never had such severe problems before, and this was the only meal where my wife and I had the same dishes.

I complained to the Maricopa County restaurant examiners, but they weren't interested unless others complained as well. Meantime there is no way I would ever return. I don't need the aggravation."}
{"text":"My husband and another friend went for an early dinner on a Sunday. We were there by 5pm and the place was already hopping! When you order the dinner for 2+, you get a delicious chilled chicken salad, a choice of soup & some of the best crab puffs in town. My friend and I enjoyed the Chicken w/ Snow Peas & Walnut Shrimp. No complaints! Hot, fresh and plenty to take home for lunch at work the next day. My husband enjoyed the Sweet & Sour Chicken. Big pieces of moist, white chicken. We drove from 1-17 and the Carefree Hwy to check this place out. Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Very good old school style Chinese restaurant. Good service and good sized portions. We took food home. As others have said parking is not good. So you may be driving around a bit. Also the boiled Won Tons are awesome!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I got take-out here last week. We got the house special pork and General Tso's chicken. Definitely a cut above typical Chinese take-out (a guilty pleasure I almost always regret immediately afterward, because it's rarely ever really that good). We both felt like it was a little bland though. 

Nothing mind-blowing, but next time I'm in the mood for Chinese take-out, this'll be near the top of my list."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The staff was very attentive and the food was great. We ordered two sweet and saucy dishes and won't do that again (too much sweet and vinegar with two dishes) but it was all very good tasting. Portions are huge and there were plenty of leftovers.

We had the Hot Spicy Sichuan Prawns which were the best part of the meal.
We had the Orange Chicken which was okay but we wouldn't get again.
House Fried Rice which was very good.
Vegetable Chow Mein which was good also.

Net time we'll get the Hot Spicy Prawns again and get another savory dish as these are plenty sweet.

Highly recommend this place and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place when I heard 'chile' for the name of this est.. Well, to cut this short; I am a spicy fave type of guy. I didnt experience any 'CHILE let alone some black pepper for my black pepper chicken.  Had i wanted some dry chicken calamari imposture whatever it was I wouldve payed for the real thing, this est. upset me and I threw it, what they tried to feed me, in the trash. THIS PLACE WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT. I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN. Even if they dared try to redeem what happened."}
{"text":"I haven't had much here, as I live in North Scottsdale. My sister lives a few minutes away, however, and I had the pleasure of having the food here for Christmas dinner. The first time I ate here, I ordered the orange chicken, and I was unimpressed. I'm guessing that flavor depends slightly on which cook they have on. On Christmas, they couldn't answer the phones, as they were packed, so my brother-in-law just went over to order the food. He took a picture of the restaurant, and it looked more like a packed music venue than a restaurant. I think that's the first sign of a good restaurant-locals who regularly visit.
The following dishes were great: Beef with Snow Peas, Orange Chicken, and Hunan Tofu. The Sichuan Prawns, however, were absolutely amazing. I would gladly drive the 20 minutes or so there and back for this dish alone. My sister and my brother-in-law order the orange chicken regularly, but my order on  Christmas converted her to the Prawns. Unfortunately, he has the palate of a 3 year old picky eater and doesn't eat seafood, so she can only have them on occasion. 
There was a write-up on the prawns in Phoenix magazine within the last 6 months or so that made the writer sound like a complete idiot who likes to talk about nothing at all and has no way of actually discerning different flavors in a dish, but the one thing I would agree with him or her is that the Prawns are excellent.
My name is Stirling Peters."}
{"text":"Boiled wontons are delicious! Order them spicy and with some white rice! Place can be crowded but the wait is rarely long."}
{"text":"We were driving around & decided to Yelp nearby restaurants. China Chili popped up in the list & had received good reviews, so we decided to stop by. The parking spaces in front & behind the restaurant are limited & when we got there, there were no spots open so we had to park on the street. When we walked in, we noticed the restaurant was much larger than it appeared from the outside & was pretty busy - a good first sign.

We were promptly seated & brought our drinks. We ordered the Fried Golden Prawns for an appetizer and the Chicken in Phoenix Nest & Sesame Chicken for our meal. The prawns were good but nothing special. There were sweet & sour and horseradish sauces on the table which were the only reason that the prawns had any taste. As for our meal, the Chicken in Phoenix Nest was in an interesting tasting sauce - the first couple of bites were good but left a weird after taste. I only ate 3 or 4 bites. The Sesame Chicken was the same way. I understand that it's a different preparation than the sweet American version but this plate just had a bunch of slices of fried chicken with a gravy tasting sauce poured on top. I only ended up eating about 4 or 5 bites of this as well & was done.

Additionally, one of the things we noticed was that our waiter was really nice. We had a few questions about the menu & he was more than happy and nice, answered everything. Some of the ladies who were waitresses there, however, were not friendly. They glared at people when walking around picking up plates & dropping off meals. It was a little un-comforting / intimidating to get these looks while eating. Overall, due to the taste of the food & experience, we probably will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure. I drive by it all the time, and never checked it out because it seemed kind of grungy from the outside. However, it always looked busy, so I thought I'd give it a try.
My large family and i ordered A LOT of food. We all shared it and had leftovers for days. We ordered the shrimp fried rice, the moo shoo vegetable, the spicy eggplant, crab puffs, spring rolls, orange chicken, vegetable egg-foo young, and a couple of other things that were great. Their food was delicious. One of the best Chinese restaurants in the valley, for sure. Their crab puffs and moo shoo vegtable stood out to me. My dad loved the orange chicken and said that in his 72 years of life, it was the best orange chicken he has ever had. 
I recommend this place. They have great lunch specials, as well. The service is amazing and the women are very attentive. Our drinks were always full. 
We will definitely be back many times."}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best Chinese I've had in Phoenix since I came out 7 years ago from NYC.  I ordered delivery through DoorDash and ordered Pork Fried Rice, Mu Shu Pork, Half Duck, and Singapore Rice Noodles.  Each dish was absolutely marvelous!  So glad I've finally found Chinese so tasty."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good, dependable Chinese restaurant in the neighborhood for several months, but didn't find anything exceptional.  We tried China Chili last Saturday on sort of a lark, and were totally delighted. The food was excellent, service was fantastic and for 2 people, with appetizers, soup, 2 entrees and plum wine it was only $40 (with food to take home!).  The only issue is that the room is cavernous, but if you've ever tried places in NYC or SF Chinatown, you will feel right at home."}
{"text":"We shared potstickers, cream cheese puffs, orange beef, house special chicken and sweet and sour chicken. The sweet and sour sauce was amazing and the chili sauce for the potstickers was awesome. None of it disappointed. We would recommend this over and over."}
{"text":"Ehhh, its ok. The best thing about this place is the service. We were in a large group of people and everyone was taken care of as if there were only a few of us. They even put our outside cake in the fridge for an after dinner celebration.

The food...it doesn't taste bad...and then again it isn't remarkable. I always end up (this wasn't my first visit) with the same thing, Garlic Green Beans and Fried Tofu. This is the most critter-less dish i can find on the menu. I don't know how you get so much grease outta green beans and fried tofu...I'm talkin' pork dish grease. Ok, so that's my gripe.

I'm pretty sure i'll go back for another birthday celebration or when there's a large group of people trying to decide what will satisfy everyone, or when i need a quick lunch that's not drive thru."}
{"text":"I was covered in the spicy prawn sauce and the stray cats in my ghetto neighborhood surrounded me, trying to lick it off me.... Then I woke up and realized it was the most horrible dream I've ever had!

This dream occurred the same night I had China Chili again after a long hiatus. I used to come here all the time for lunch when I worked closer. The lunch specials were great, about $10 for soup, a wonton, an eggroll and my favorite SPICY PRAWNS. 

The prawns were tempura-battered, deep-fried and drenched in a spicy, tangy sauce and served over rice. It usually has been very good for me. However, my recent experience left me drinking lots and lots of water. Not that it was spicy or anything but the sauce has gotten EXTREMELY salty. 

Did they have a change in chefs? Am I just more sensitive to salt? I'm not sure but this was not the same China Chili I once knew and loved. Now I only, \"like\" it."}
{"text":"My friend and I were interested in trying a new place in Phoenix and we found this through yelp. Rated high so I was looking forward to it. It's a nice, older Chinese restaurant. Decor is a bit outdated but it felt like a throwback to one of my favorite Chinese restaurant. 

Service was nice. Not overly attentive but enough. We ordered beef fried rice, salt and pepper pork chops and house chicken. Every dish was delicious. It felt like a lot of compare and contrast to other places we've been but we thoroughly finished everything. We liked how the fried rice had more eggs then most places. We like how the seasoning of the pork chops was on the batter and not the meat. Tasty! The chicken was crispy and the sauce had the right amount of garlic to it. Order it on the side not on top!

Overall, I enjoyed the place. A tad bit pricey compared to others but good food. We'll come again in the near future to try other dishes."}
{"text":"We love this place! When compared to the other places in Phoenix, China Chili is at the top.  My favorite is the Black Pepper Sizzling Beef. Pork Imperial Sauce is also a favorite. Service is good and friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite chinese dish is honey walnut shrimp. One day I was searching for a place that has honey walnut shrimp. After I read all the great reviews, I was sold and I had to give this place a chance. The dish is very good. Will definitely be eating here again!!"}
{"text":"China Chili is a great spot for lunch if you are craving some Chinese in the city. I had the Orange Chicken and my dad had the Sweet and Sour Chicken. Both were excellent! The lunch specials include a cup of the soup of the day, rice, and a spring roll all for under $8! My dad and I are both big guys and we couldn't even finish half of our meals. The service was very good. The servers all float around and split the tips so we had 4 or 5 different people help us refill drinks, bring the check, and to-go boxes. A must try if you are in the mood for good quality Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Downtown Phoenix is severely limited when it comes to good Chinese food unless you venture off into the suburbs or head towards the Chinese Cultural Center. For this part of town however, China Chili was definitely my go-to place. They've got a cheap lunch special and had an oddly nice dining hall. The service is always very attentive and the prices are fair. The food is a mixture of authentic Chinese dishes with the occasional Americanized dish here and there,so it caters to nearly everyone. Vegetarian friendly and good for groups, China Chili was the place I went when feeling home-sick for Los Angeles and in dire need of some good won ton soup, but didn't have a car or time to go to the Cultural Center. Not my favorite, but gets the job done. Just slightly less greasy than Siu Wok down the road."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!!! You must go, authentic and delicious :) My favorite is the orange chicken and shrimp fried rice!! This food is great for a Netflix night and Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Found this great restaurant when I first moved to the area and really enjoyed the food. I was there at a slow time so received excellent service."}
{"text":"I always hear hype about China Chili...now I've been there a few times and it is decent but nothing to rave about.  Unfortunately I never made it there prior to the big move but I really cannot imagine that much changed in the way of food greatness.  My vote still goes to GHoHK."}
{"text":"A local favorite of mine. Fresh and quick. No small talk from the servers but I don't mind. The food is always delicious and hot. Great spot to check out. Try the lemon shrimp or the king pap duo."}
{"text":"My first review of China Chili was 4 stars. After today's experience I am down to 1 star. I had Kung Pao Chicken and my wife had Lemon Chicken. I like it spicey but this was just sour. I had to leave it. My wife enjoyed her Lemon Chicken but 1 1/2 hours later became sick to her stomach. I wonder if anyone else had a similar experience there today. We have been there several times and were always pleased with everything. This was the first time we had this type of experience. Service was good, food was not."}
{"text":"My husband and I rode our bikes here last weekend for dinner. We loved it! The decor is a little old timey and charming and the food was delicious! We ordered the mushroom soup, crab puffs, vegetable chow mien, and scallops. It was all really good and now we know why this spot is always packed! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"After being sat we waiting 20 mins before anyone even acknowledged our party. The food was really basic Chinese food nothing great about this place. I ordered some egg rolls and they were smaller than a spring roll, so disappointed. The only thing I could say good about this place was the Chinese beer. I would only go back for that only."}
{"text":"My friend was starving and wanted Chinese food after being on the road for a full day coming from California. So glad we stopped here! The food was good and our bill came out to $39 for 1 appetizer and 4 main plates."}
{"text":"We walk to China chili during our short lunch hour hour. They get us in and out in exceptional time. The food is great especially the orange chicken. Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with a very close friend , I ordered the sizzling rice soup and the fried prawns for an appetizer. Both were quite tasty,the prawns were quite large,and not overly breaded.The soup was very tasty , and much like other reviewers , we barley finished when the main courses came out.
I ordered the kung pau beef, my companion ,the snow white chicken . Both were very good, and the portions were so large ,we both had an extra meal out of it. Would definitely come back again, although, I do question the claim of best Chinese in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I ate here with some coworkers for lunch. The place was definitely busy. I would say the food was just okay. I had the orange chicken and have had better versions at other restaurants. The fried rice was not the greatest. My lunch was on the cheaper end but I really don't need to go back."}
{"text":"Still the absolute worst customer service! Wow I keep giving them a chance and the fail. Throw my plate in front , eat with three of us and they bring one plate at a time with about 5-10 min between . I am done wasting my time and money on this place for subpar food"}
{"text":"Always great food and service! I love the pillow chicken, the sizzling rice soup, and the hot and sour soup! Consistently great!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the service is awesome.  They can customize some dishes and very accommodating.  The owner Sally is always there and its great, affordable and quality good tasting food.  I love the salt pepper pork, shrimp, scallops, etc...  Good Chinese food for Phoenix."}
{"text":"We ordered Hot and Sour Soup, Salt and Pepper Prawns and Honey Walnut Shrimp.  It was very good and quite inexpensive. Their dinner selection is more extensive and more authentic than their lunch choices."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. It's a favorite locale for my husband's family and I love going to dinner with them here. It's always a very positive experience. My favorite part is the lazy susan centerpiece. We all order our own plate and have it placed in the center. Everyone shares and we all get a bit of everything. It makes for a very diverse meal. 

I love their boiled wanton soup here. It has just the right bit of kick. I crave this like crazy and can't get enough. I love any of their shrimp dishes and often order shrimp chow-mein. I also highly recommend their orange chicken. It's among the best that I've ever tasted. It definitely beats Panda Express.

The environment is casual and friendly. There's always a buzz of conversation, but its never overly loud. The staff are really great and will have a drink refill on the table for you before you're even halfway done with the first one. It's very clean and well decorated. This place certainly attracts a crowd, but you wouldn't know it from the great service. It's definitely a perfect place for large families. You get incredible food for a very affordable price and the somewhat calm environment allows a great opportunity to socialize."}
{"text":"Still the Best in Town hands down. I've never had a bad meal here and the service is always tip top."}
{"text":"The best in Phoenix!  We have been going to China Chile for many years....while they were at their old location.  I know there is better chinese food in other cities, but it's the best Phoenix has to offer.  We have many choices of mediocre Chinese restaurants.  This is NOT mediocre!  First we always start with the boiled wontons.  If you haven't tried them, you are in for an outstanding surprise.  We had never eaten them in other restaurants, even LA or SF or NY.  These are causing my mouth to water (as I sit here writing the review!)because they are sooo delicious.  We ask them to not put chiles in ours, but they are still fabulous.  We like their eggplant, Moo Shu, Singapore noodles( new for us last nite and we would order again.) Honey Walnut Prawns are yummmm, the lettuce leaves with minced chicken are really good.  We've had thier noodles, their various soups, various pork dishes.  WE have always walked out of China Chile saying \"too bad it's so far from our home\"  But we still trot back there at least once a month!  Restaurant is pretty attractive, and quite large, the same staff has been there for years. You won't be disappointed!  It's a winner!  Oh I forgot one other thing we like: The Lover's Prawns.  After eating here so many times, we are very pleased to have China Chile in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town.... they do salt and pepper EVERYTHING (Chicken, pork chop, shrimp, and squid)! 
Not to mention they are quick! You can call them up and no matter how big the order is it will be done in 15 minutes. I always joke about it but it's not a laughing matter when other restaurants have you waiting."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal, definitely recommend the chicken fried rice and the orange chicken."}
{"text":"Being a Visitor in PHX for a week and looking for a good Chinese food, specially that the first attend to eat at a Chinese restaurant failed. 

I had to reach out to my FB friends who Recommended this place. And they were right, love the food here and the service was efficient. 

Tasty food indeed, this place is the bomb! :-)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty good. They are friendly, make and serve your food fast, and the prices are reasonable. The ambiance is OK but not romantic. It's more like a group cafeteria setting but comfortable. The food is tasty."}
{"text":"Great place to get some delicious and legit Chinese food.  Do not expect speedy service but the food is worth the wait and we all need to slow down anyway.  No need to rush all the time :) Kung pao chicken and fried bananas are both among the best I've had.  Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Two words: Boiled Wontons. If you pass by them on the menu without ordering them, you have missed out on one of their best appetizers. As other reviews have mentioned, China Chili's orange chicken is on point and their service is swift. Highly recommend this place if you are craving some Chinese food and are in the area. You honestly can't go wrong with any item on the menu."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Chinese Restaurant experiences I've ever had...everything was delicious...there were dishes there I've never seen offered before. This was my first time there but will definitely eat here again when in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"There is really one reason that I go to China Chili all the time...The boiled wontons.  The rest of the food is pretty typical chinese fare.  Best to take a group of friends and mix and match dishes. 

Our favorite dishes here, besides the boiled won tons, are the spicy eggplant and the green beans and tofu.  We order them extra spicy to kick it up a notch. Even extra spicy and Dan will load up both the boiled won tons and the dishes with the hot sauce at the table.  In fact we usually leave the hot sauce jar empty by the time we leave the restaurant.  

Parking is a bit hard to find on busy nights there and I usually end up parking on the street.  

The portions are gigantic and I always have take away dishes for the next day.

Prices are reasonable.  If you do order the soup realize you can order it and share for the table."}
{"text":"Super cheap, authentic... and delicious local Chinese food. The restaurant is always packed and the staff busy but decently attentive. They never lack on the amount of the food on the plate for the price. Good place to go for lunch with friends/coworkers."}
{"text":"This place was pretty solid. I ordered the sesame chicken and I was lost in the sauce (in a good way). The sauce was really sweet and went perfectly with the lightly battered chicken. I would say the only con was the fact that the dish came with a small amount of rice.

I'm excited to return and try more of the dishes!"}
{"text":"Food tastes good and service is very good as well. We ordered egg flower soup, mapo tofu, house special chicken and vegetable deluxe. Egg flower soup and mapo tofu were especially good."}
{"text":"The food quality was really good. I ordered the orange and kung pao chicken with a side of chow mein and fried rice. My only dissatisfaction was with the kung pao chicken but I usually only order it for the family so I don't think I can really say what good kung pao chicken is supposed to taste like. All the rest of the food even tasted great the next day after reheating."}
{"text":"I must admit that tonight being Christmas Eve was not the best night to go, but they should be prepared for the business that they're going to receive on Christmas Eve.

We ordered $85 drink and food for a party of four.  The staff that Sally had on that night was insufficient, badly equipped, very impatient and rude.

Our appetizers Eggrolls, Crab Ragoons were cold, geasy and soggy!  The soup was Luke warm to room temperature!
I brought it to my servers attention and she never came back to the table and totally ignored me the table next to ours have the same problem I don't know what their outcome was. 

After dinner,
I took the Sally the owner aside privately and told her that I was not satisfied with the appetizers but the dinner was good!  I also told her the soup was cold. 

This was not the first time I've had a complaint with China Chile.  They always have an excuse!  Denying anything that they did wrong and make they make no exceptions on the bill and offered no apologies.  Sally is always right!  I will never spend another dollar in that establishment. There are many other Chinese restaurants in the Phoenix metro area to go to that are accommodating and respectful to their customers!  China Chili's decour is dated and cheap! The atmosphere makes you feel cheap and cheated.  Lighting in many areas is poor The food is expensive, it's mediocre at best!   The bathrooms are filthy dirty and there's no hot water in the mens room.  I intend to call the health department!  If they can't provide hot water and a clean bathrooms  in the establishment,  I shutter to think how dirty the rest of the restaurant is and what other health codes they are breaking?  

There is absolutely no excuse for saying NO to the customer when they say they are unsatisfied with the service or food!  

She's going to learn that one dissatisfied customer can create fifty more by social media and I intend to be the one to make her learn that!  If I were you I would dodge a bullet and never frequent this business!     

I found it absolutely infuriating that she had the audacity to come to our table and tell me I was wrong and that she would be willing to do nothing and offered no apology no exception on the bill. I must also inform everybody on YELP,  that we tipped the waitress her 20%. Unlike Sally the owner we realize that it was a holiday and that her employees should not be punished for her lack of poor management. 

I also need to mention that we all became ill after the meal and I am sure it had to do with the Eggrolls and the Crab Ragoon.  I wasn't as sick as two others that decided it was too much of a hassle to complain about it. So I only ate half of each. 

I frequent many restaurants here in the Phoenix area and I would do yourself a favor and avoid giving this establishment your hard earned money and respectable business. 

There is a new business that seems quite impressive,   a restaurant directly across the street from China Chile that has excellent food,  excellent service ample parking for the same money!"}
{"text":"Parking is a little  difficult.  But service  makes up for it . There must  be an army in the kitchen.  We  recommend  pork fried rice. Sinapore noodles. Salt and pepper  pork chops . Eggs and shrimp."}
{"text":"Excellent and fast service during lunch hours. Over priced Mediocre food."}
{"text":"Had the hot & spicy Sichuan Prawns, expecting too hot, but had the right kind of spice! Yum, yum, yummy. Wish the would Chinese Fried Chicken more often, last time I tried to order, they had run out, so had crispy duck. It was good, but still wish it was crispy chicken...LOL"}
{"text":"A lot of people from work seem to like to go here. After being there several times I still dont get what the fuss is. Maybe its because they are quick with turn around? They sure can move food to the table very quickly and get you out fast.

As far as taste goes, I have had better. With the Chinese Culture center not too far away either, I would chose that place over China Chili any day. A couple co-workers after having been there over the course of several years seems to be in agreement with me as well. If someone recommends it, we usually know of a better chinese place downtown than China Chili."}
{"text":"I've been enjoying lunches and dinners here over the years with friends, with my swim team, and with visitors and guests. Each and every time the food was delicious, served in generous portions, and it didn't take long for food to be brought to the table even when I was with relatively large groups. While definitely Asian, the flavors lean a bit toward westernized - not a bad thing here, really; the food is always very tasty. I especially love how they prepare their fish: really tender and succulent. I also recommend their  tofu dishes and if you want a different spin on this Asian beancurd staple, try their pillow tofu. The restaurant itself is big and spacious, a bit gaudily decorated as most big old-fashioned Chinese restaurants are, and the service is fast and efficient. Oh ... and something to keep in mind now that the holiday season approaches: they're open on Christmas Day ;)"}
{"text":"Service  is always  great . Food will be on your table so fast . Food is fresh and hot . Parking is a problem.  Portions  are large. My favorite  is Peking duck . Dumplings.  Salt and pepper  pork chops. Pork fried rice"}
{"text":"I can't get enough; my absolute favorite Chinese food in Phoenix. The duck is top notch, I love the tofu with string beans and basically everything else I've ever tried, the service is fast, friendly and efficient. I highly recommend China chili- I even have it in speed dial  five stars!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that is basically overrated just because of its location and longevity. There are so few places that have survived in the downtown Phoenix area for as long as China Chili has, and for that, it probably does deserve a lot of credit. 

That being said, it's basically an average Chinese restauant. Comfortable, convenient, clean, and it offers all the standard fare. It's everything you'll need for a weekday dinner, but not much more.

Try the sizzling rice soup. It's very good. Plus Jerry Colangelo is known to take out their sweet 'n' sour shrimp...or is it the chicken? Who cares, either way, that's pretty cool."}
{"text":"Best chinese food in central Phoenix Lin's is better but this place is really good to.."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Shows up hot & fast and the service was some of the best I've had. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"solid place that is fast and good for a work lunch. Come here with my coworkers at least twice a month and the food is consistent and solid."}
{"text":"Just came from China Chili for lunch. First time for me. The service was very fast and friendly. The food was fine too, nothing really special but fine. I would go back if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is OK. Nothing above the ordinary, but not below average either.
The food is good, the service so so . I have heard so many good things about this place that maybe I was dissapointed when I was not overly impressed with it.

Very little parking, bathroom is clean.
Food comes out nice and hot and the tea is decent. The place could use a bit of a shine up for sure. Prices are good though. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Short: Great consistent food. Good lunch deals. I get the House Special Chicken. Maybe a dollar or two expensive for the type of Chinese food it is.

Longer: Been going here for years and when I worked nearby I would go frequently at lunch. Their lunch specials are great and comes with soup and a vegetable egg roll. The only problem is that it's maybe a dollar or two too expensive for the type of chinese food it is. It's nothing fancy, just good solid Chinese food. The place is pretty big but is always packed when I go. 

I personally get the House Special Chicken. Other good items depending on your mood:

Appertizers: Veggie Egg Rolls, West Lake Soup

Seafood: Almond and Cashew Nut Prawns

Chicken: Besides the House Special Chicken, Chicken in Black Bean Sauce

Pork: Sweet and Sour Pork

Also, I get the fried rice which is an extra $1 at lunch.

Service is super fast especially at lunch, otherwise, typical Asian service, not very personable and even if they were, it may be difficult to understand so maybe it's better to save for the awkward conversation anyways. Also, I'm not one for overly friendly (fake) service anyways, so it's not necessarily a bad thing."}
{"text":"If you like Chinese Buffets, then this place is not for you.  China Chili is probably the most authentic Chinese food I've had in AZ.  Makes me feel like I'm in New York, or better yet, CHINA!  I have a theory when it comes to Chinese food - if there are lots of Asian people there, its prbably good, because for them its food.  Order the orange chicken, salty squid, eggplant in garlic sauce or the mayonaise shrimp and walnuts.  All are out of this world!  I even had my wedding rehearsal dinner, that's how much me and the family love this place!  The staff are attentive, courteous and happy to answer any questions you have.  It doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed with the taste of food here, as the restaurant really looks inviting, authentic with great and fast customer service. Hot and sour soup was good. My Mongolian beef lacked spices and a kick. Egg foo young was swimming in a sauce that could have had more depth in flavor. Still looking for good Chinese in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ok, so I lived in Chicago and California with the best Chinese food. Been in Phoenix for six years and haven't found good Chinese food until now!!! China Chili is the best!!!! They make amazing Shrimp Fried rice and Orange Chicken. Good service and great atmosphere. You have to check this place out."}
{"text":"China Chili strikes again. We are not big Chinese food eaters but whenever we do have a craving, China Chili does not disappoint. We end up eating here about 4 times a year and are always happy. Tonight we had the orange chicken, house chow mein and ss pork. Nothing too adventurous but great taste and great price. We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Ducks on the menu. I love a roasted duck meal. Woo way to much for just me but it was every bit of delicious."}
{"text":"Bomb!! 

Bomb orange chicken... Not like weird
Mc nuggets covered in sauce. We order it extra spicy 

Szechuan beef so so

Bomb egg rolls 

Bomb pot stickers 

Bomb spicy mustard"}
{"text":"Came in with my co-workers a few times and had to write a review.  This place just blew me away.  The amount of good food you get for such a small price was shocking.  My order of Mongolian Beef was practically falling off the plate and after everything including tip I only forked up $10.  Place is quick as well which is a big plus for lunch hour plans.

Highly recommend this place for anyone working near the Capitol."}
{"text":"Service was friendly as always. However, the food was very bland. And the rice was burnt. The soup, the rice, the Mongolian beef, and the broccoli chicken was BLAND. Even the egg rolls were BLAND. The only flavorful thing tonight was my Coca Cola. Today was not their day."}
{"text":"China Chili is back. It's now located near 3rd St. and Osborn. I never ate IN the restaurant at the old location --- I always ordered take-out --- but I have now eaten at the new restaurant twice.

The food is as good as you remember. Delicious, generous portions of Chinese in every chicken, pork, beef and seafood option you can imagine. 

My only criticism is the new location itself. While it is larger than that previous, two things bother me about it.

First, it is one giant room. You can see everyone and everything. I might be used to having booths or partitions to help create a smaller more intimate feel, but I felt a little exposed. Of course this is a bonus if you like people watching. You can pretty much spy on anyone depending on where you are seated.

The other thing I find odd is the room itself. It is VERY well lit. (Again, a bonus if you are into checking out what the table across the room is having. Not so much if you want to have an intimate dinner.) Many huge, brightly-shining chandeliers adorn its ceiling and every one is one. No burnt out bulbs here.

But like I said, the food is still the real draw. I may just stick with ordering take-out."}
{"text":"Huge portions, order two items and it will serve four. In a funky location but really good \"American Chinese\" food."}
{"text":"A truly authentic Chinese restaurant.The Boiled won tons are outstanding.We also ordered the Singapore noodles ,equally as good.The lettuce leaves are wonderful. In fact almost every dish is worthy of praise. 
Service is good. The wine list is fairly priced . Also worth mentioning,  it is a kid friendly Restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow! what a great meal last night. Kinda nervous to go back after being there a cpl of years ago for lunch and not loving it. BUTTTTT 2 words: Boiled Wontons. Order these and u will prob crave them for days. Spicy broth with boiled wontons in a light peanut sauce. I also ordered my fave, Peking duck. Very impressed with the quality and will be going back more. They do bring the food out superman fast so you kinda feel rushed but other than that, i see why they are sooo packed."}
{"text":"If I could put 0 I would. I'm from San Diego and I'm used to eating decent food! The food here is garbage and so is the service. The salt and pepper chicken did not taste or look like chicken, it looked like battered chicken skin.  If you want to try delicious Chinese food, make the drive to San Diego, you will never want to come back and eat here."}
{"text":"Order the Salt & Pepper Shrimp, and Dip it in sweet and sour sauce! Everything was Delicious! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Very good food. Don't like their sweet and sour sauce or their pillow chicken but they can sure pull off a mean sesame chicken and those boiled won tons are to die for! 

I haven't gotten to test out their duck yet but their food has me wow'd compared to some of the crap I've gotten from other Asian restaurants near the area!

Definitely give this place a try and more than once because not everyone likes the same things, but you will find a dish you like on their menu, believe that!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch this weekend after not visiting for over 10 years. 
We were warmly greeted and quickly seated.  We ordered the steamed potstickers to share and I enjoyed the snow white chicken with snow peas, mushrooms and chicken in a white wine sauce with a side of rice.  The portions were pretty large and the food was quite tasty.  We'll definitely add China Chili to the repeat list whenever we're looking for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese food in Phoenix. Big portions, decent prices."}
{"text":"Finding a traditional Chinese restaurant that serves more than just fried rice, orange chicken, mongolian beef and the usual staples is always a satisfying experience, especially when EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS FANTASTIC! I've found my go to Chinese place when I'm in Phoenix and that is China Chili. 

Walking through the 100+ degree weather to get some Chinese food didn't deter me, although I was drenched by the time I got there. Inside it looks like your usual Chinese dine-in place with the low lighting, cheap leather seats and rather large round tables. I was promptly greeted and my order taken, I got fried rice, prawns, soup, orange chicken, etc. All of which was surprisingly cheap and after a 15 minute wait decent sized portions.

When I got home even though the food has gotten cold it was still great! I can only imagine what it would be like fresh. Everything was flavorful and cooked to perfection. My family thoroughly enjoyed things over the next couple of days. 

Overall, great food, good atmosphere, friendly staff. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll make sure to stop by here."}
{"text":"Went today with co-workers for lunch.  It's my first time there.  The place was busy but we didn't have to wait to get a table.  Our orders were taken soon after.  
We all had the soup of the day which was hot and sour soup.  It was decent, not bad. I ordered the Kung Po Fish from the lunch menu.  The food came out really fast.  The potion was big and the taste was fine but a little bit too sweet.  It came with egg roll and white rice.  I only finished eating half the meal and had the rest including the whole egg roll put in a 'Kari out' box.  

I think I would come back to try other food.  But, I really hope they would have more choices on the lunch menu.  The current lunch dishes are mostly deep fried or battered.  More stir fry or less sweet on the sauce would be nice."}
{"text":"China Chili has been our go to Chinese food spot for years and years. The best Chinese food restaurant in Phoneix."}
{"text":"I swung by after a Last Chance session and picked up takeout. It was super duper fast and quite inexpensive. I couldnt wait to tear into the goods when I got home. When i did, I was unimpressed.

The lunch special Kung Pao Chicken was filled with gross dark meat chicken \"parts\" that I didn't even feed to my dog. The shrimp fried rice was overly salty, oddly colored, and not very tasty. I am still on the hunt for a GOOD chinese place here in Phx. This definitely wasn't it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service. Huge portions. Love that I never have to ask for a refills on drinks. Every dish I've ever had at this great place has been delish.  I'm hooked. We go here at least once a month. Faves: Lemon chicken & Mongolian beef. Dang...it's almost 10pm and now I'm craving China Chili!!!!"}
{"text":"Best boiled wontons. Get them everytime. If you like garlic and peanut sauce you will love them. OMG and they wontons are a very good size dumpling. I always ask for extra peanut sauce and alittle more spicey and it's wonderful. Enjoy my friends."}
{"text":"Based on so many comments on Yelp, my wife and I visited today for lunch.  I had sweet and sour chicken.  Wife had sweet and sour shrimp.  We both were impressed with the size of the dining room.  Service was swift and immediate.  We both thought our dishes, although good were nothing out of the ordinary.  Both tasted bland and well....just ordinary.  We were only given a lunch menu which was a bit limited.  The dishes that other yelpers reviewed about must have come from the evening meal servivce.  They sure weren't on the lunch menu.  Prices were good.  Service was good.  Lunches were from a steam table I'm sure.  Based on what we saw today, I don't think the place merits a trip back.  We live near Glendale and 35th ave.  The food is hardly worth the trip.  May try again some evening but doubt it.  There are so many good restaurants closer to us that bland unseasoned food is hardly a magnet."}
{"text":"The reviews for this place are about as far off as they can be. Yes it's cheap but Panda Express makes a better plate and I refuse to eat at panda. Staff is rude, food is bland. Yelpers....... you have failed. I live a block away and won't be returning."}
{"text":"One of my favorite quick, easy and reliable work day lunch spots!!!!  Carryout or dine in, you can't go wrong. I personally have an hour lunch and this place is a 5 minute drive from my office. I can sit down, enjoy my food, mingle with co-workers AND get back to the office with my doggy-bag and not feel rushed!  

My favorites are the orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken. I appreciate that for their lunch special you not only get your entree and rice, but also a spring roll AND their soup du jour!!!  Yum Yum  Yum! There are always left overs (well if you're me) and sometimes I share with a co-worker and it's just enough for two ladies."}
{"text":"The lettuce wraps were very flavorful and a huge portions for 2 people.  The plum sauce complemented the wrap well and it was tasty.  

The egg drop soup, the Kung Pao Chicken & Black Bean Chicken was a large portion of food,  and had great texture and consistency.  Unfortunately, those entree were slightly bland for my taste"}
{"text":"Lots of seating & pretty good Chinese food! The sesame chicken & house chicken are delicious & a nice change from the breaded nuggets like most places serve, this was a whole pieces of boneless chicken that's fried then sliced. The noodle dishes are pretty good as well. Service can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"Fast service, good prices. I ordered the special shrimp fried rice it was delicious. I also ordered the Chicken corn soup. This place is huge! It's a stand alone building. Perfect for any large event or outing I would think the restaurant can host over 200 people."}
{"text":"Bland taste for what this restaurant's reputation has in the neighborhood.  I was not impressed at all.  I had Sweet and Sour Chicken, Pork Fried Rice and Wonton Soup.  Nothing to write home about.  It didn't WOW me.  The rice was very sticky, the soup was very bland in richness and the Chicken had a Boneless Buffalo Wing texture to it.  

Lucky Kitchen down the street is cheaper and is more authentic in taste."}
{"text":"GREAT CHINESE! I came here during a business trip to PHX and was told to go here by the locals. Everyone including my Lyft driver praised this place. I ordered the Mongolian Beef and it was very good. Very flavorful and chocked full of beef, which can be absent in most asian beef dishes... The service was prompt and my food came lightening fast."}
{"text":"Great service and food was amazing. I got the Mongolian beef lunch special. The portion was enormous and I took half of it with me (cold Chinese food makes a great snack.) The Mongolian beef was perfectly spicy. The hot and sour soup was delicious as well... And they gave me a free refill on it too. My drink was never more than halfway empty and I felt like I was being treated like a king. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"There is an inherent dilemma that affects all ethnic cuisine in this country. That dilemma is: How authentic are we going to make this restaurant? Basically, this question is answered by looking at the bottom line. If you are in an area with a relatively low conentration of that ethnicity then in order for your business to stay alive, you need to cater to the tastes of the local majority. The beauty of China Chili is that they walk this line and do it successfully. Restaurants that lean towards authenticity typically tend to alienate the majority of people because its simply intimidating. On the other side, a restaurant that caters to American tastes is hated on for the watered down ethnic experience. What China Chili has managed to do is make Chinese food accessible to the demographic around them. The Asian population in the Phoenix metro area is concentrated in the East Valley and Northwest Valley. There are very few Chinese downtown and that is shown by the lack of Chinese restaurants in the downtown area. China Chili has understood this and has beautifully adapted their menu to reflect the area they are in. In response to the people who commented on the lack of authenticity of the food here, I would say that I agree with that in part. However, being Chinese, I know that if you go into any Chinese restaurant that has Chinese people working there and you ask them, you'll find that there are additional items that the kitchen can make for people who are looking for that authentic experience. China Chili is no different. Just ask for something more authentic and in most cases they can tell you what they have available. I can tell you from first hand experience that they have ALL Chinese cooks in the kitchen. Its not like they don't know how to make authentic Chinese food, but like any good restaurant, they know their audience. 

Now to the food. Most of the things on the menu are pretty tasty. One thing that they do that most other places don't is tailor the food to your exact specifications. They can make it spicy, or less spicy, or omit veggies, msg, meat, or add basically anything you want. Some favorites of mines are the House Special Chicken, Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Chicken Corn Chowder, and Spicy Garlic Eggplant. During lunch, they serve hearty lunch specials that after make you wish you were going to nap time rather than work(to some that may be synonymous). They have even more dishes that they can make for lunch specials than the ones they have listed so make sure you ask. 

As for the decor....lets be honest. Chinese decor is tacky. I'm Chinese, I admit it. If the decor of a restaurant causes you to not eat there, then sadly you have probably missed the most amazing meals of your life because some of the biggest holes create some of the tastiest food. Its not dirty or messy, its just tacky, so please get over it. The Chinese are prone to gaudy, extravagant presentations, or did you miss the opening ceremonies of the Olympics?

In any case, I love China Chili because it allows people who would never walk into a more authentic Chinese restaurant to put a foot in the door of an enormous culinary world. And at China Chili they can venture in as far as they would want. ."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I order from here! Their house chicken is my absolute favorite food to order. The staff is very nice and even give you forks, plates, lots of soy sauce, and whatever else you could possibly want!

It's unfortunate that they won't deliver, but that's okay. It's worth the trip! Best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix, in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! We got the house special and orange chicken and seriously, it was good. Big thick white meat slices, very impressed. They give u an option of the degree of heat, we got medium. It was good, but if I go when someone that likes a bit of heat, def going for hot! Orange chicken sauce isn't your typical orange panda express flavour, so don't go in expecting that, it has a hint of brown sugar as well as the smell of it. I love jasmine rice and really liked that they served that. Will def be back to try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"The. Food is good and it comes out fast. The issue I have is I feel rushed by the employees walking around. They seem to walk by a lot and stare at the plates to see if your close to be done w/ your food. Great at 1st trek refills after that your forgotten. Caught one waitress staring at me that made me very uncomfortable... But again the food is good though..."}
{"text":"This place has the oiliest food I've ever eaten in my life.  I had carry out one evening (two dishes) and the entrees were soaked in oil.  I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach.  I wish I could've washed the other dish too (but it wasn't one that could be washed--it was a wide-rice noodle dish).

Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too.

Really not sure what the fuss is about."}
{"text":"If you live in central Phoenix and need chinese food, this is a good place to go.  It is a huge restaurant that serves all the normal chinese dishes.  I had the mogolian chicken and added broccoli.  I could have done without all the scallions and onions and would have liked more chicken.  The dish was good and I will probably go back again."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite restaurants to go to for dinner and I definitely agree.

All of the dishes are always fresh and delicious. I especially love the green beans with tofu. It's extremely authentic and not many places have a spicy garlic sauce that can compare to the taste of this one.

If you like quality Chinese, check this place out."}
{"text":"Went with family tonight and a lot bang for the buck. Prices are really reasonable for dinner menu and the food was amazing. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is so highly rated. The service was poor and neglectful, it was during lunch but the place was not full and we had a time line to keep being on lunch ourselves. We were seated promptly and drink order taken, when returning with drinks placed them down and quickly left without a word. Sat for 10 minutes and flagged someone for an order. Soup for the lunch specials came out after the food, wasn't good. The Mongolian Beef I ordered was a plate of onions with approx 2 oz of beef. My boyfriend ordered House Special Chicken which has always been at every restaurant I have ever been to a crispy chicken in a brown broth heavy on ginger, onion and garlic...not here. I don't know what it was but it was awful. Corn starch thickened red sauce that was sour and spicy, blunt flavor without dimension and honestly inedible. We sat for some time trying to get attention of anyone to get a bill, was ignored. Finally got a bill and the person dropped it and left never to return or point us to the bar which is where you pay but never having been there and not being directed we didn't know. I am a skilled home cook and I make better than this on a Tuesday night, for $17.89 I could have actually eaten my food at home instead of leaving 2 full plates behind."}
{"text":"Downtown, want a fast sit down Chinese lunch with a large portion this is an option.

The menu is pretty standard item wise. Lunch includes soup a spring roll and white rice. lunches range from 6.95-8.95 plus drink. $1 more for fried rice or brown which seems a bit steep to me.

I had the ma po to fu. To fu in a \"spicy\" sauce with a few veggies. They oped to use a soft tofu making this into almost a soup like dish, firmer is almost allays better with tofu. I asked for mine very spicy and I still had to add allot of chili paste.

What I don't get is the interior decorations. It seems to be a mix of pseudo 80's night club meets china. 

It is nice that you can get your own bill making paying or a large work lunch a breeze

If only the food were better."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and has not had any bad experience. It is not fancy, just real good Chinese food. 
Walnut shrimp, chicken corn chowder, garlic eggplant, peppered pork, walnut shrimp, and a couple of other Chinese American staples.  No frills, not fancy, just classically good Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. It's what I think of when I remember the chinese food places my mom and dad used to talk us to growing up in the phoenix area. Recently it seems like most of the places are super run down, the service is mediocre, and the products used in the food are down right embarrassing, well China Chilli DELIVERS! Their food was great (Veggie Lo-Main, Spicy Garlic Prawns *i dont know if this is exact name*, and the Fried Tofu special with jalapenos which wasn't bad for somebody who doesnt like Tofu) and the service was above average. The tell tale sign of this place was two things before I ate the food, how clean it was inside (and kinda chinese cheesy) and the parking lot was full when I drove by and when I came back to eat in addition to that there was a constant flow of people ordering take out. If you are in the mood for chinese take-out or to pop in for a quick bite, I would definitely recommend this over any other place around Cen-Pho that I've come across."}
{"text":"I recently started working really close to this restaurant and came for the first time about a month ago. I now order take out for lunch once a week or once every two weeks. It's really tasty, fast & my order is always accurate (have never had any problems with take out orders). My favorite dish is the Kung Pao Shrimp. It's very good! I'd recommend this to anyone in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"We have ordered via delivery service several times and love all the main dishes.  Their friend rice isn't too salty or soaked in soy sauce like some places. The house lo mein and pepper calamari are both so addicting. Flavoring is great and not too greasy. We love that they poke ventilation holes into the fried items so they stay crispy.  Their soups however have been a little meh. Tried hot and sour and egg drop and neither really lived up to the rest of the menu. This is one of our favorite places!"}
{"text":"Let start of saying I used to live in Beijing and chengdu for 10 years so I feel I know Chinese food very well. This is not the food they eat in China, But it is delicious American Chinese food! I read a lot of of the reviews here on yelp. All were pretty much spot on. The pot stickers we really great. Huge and crispy on one side. We came because of the check please review this weekend of this place. We knew from that that we should try the Orange chicken. Very good. The sauce was just right,  not to thick not to thin. We also had the Sichuan green beans. Good but we have had far better at the really authentic Sichuan resturant in Phoenix at the Sechwan Palace at the chinese cultural center. We also had the Mongolian beef that a another yelper had suggested. The best dish we had. Finally we had the veggie fried rice. I thought it was ok but my wife thought it was not good."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst. But the way I am feeling incredibly am pretty sure there was MSG somewhere. The wait staff were minimally attentive."}
{"text":"Never disappoints , the Pork fried rice and orange chicken are on point! Clean atmosphere and the few times I've gone to get take out, the staff seems to remember everyone's name and story."}
{"text":"Salt n pepper pork was DELICIOUS! Clean dining room, Very attentive service and people kept coming in."}
{"text":"China Chili is pretty decent on the side of american chinese food. Hubby and I went around 8:30p and ordered, good service, delicious food. If we happen to be in the area , will def go eat again!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I am worried that I live too close and will get too fat based on this."}
{"text":"I have never ever had a bad meal here! The spicy garlic eggplant is to DIE for!!! Love it! The potstickers are yummy as well!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Fast, fresh, delectable! Great location. Actually this truly is one of the best Chinese we have in the valley.... Very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I ordered their House Chicken dish and found it HOT other than that no other flavors. I took it home and added some veggies and sweetness with some pineapple. Shouldn't have to remake the \"House\" recipe. 
The chicken was also disappointing, sliced very thin and rubbery."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese that I have had in the valley. Prompt service. Vast menu. Eat in or take out. On busy nights, finding parking can be an issue and like every other Chinese spot in the Valley, THEY DON'T HAVE DUCK SAUCE! WTF?!?! Duck sauce must be an East Coast thing..."}
{"text":"OMG first time coming here and it won't be the last. Everything was delicious from the magnolian chicken to the vegetable fried rice, the steam pot stickers and the vegetable spring rolls. The service was amazing the food was plentiful.. you can definitely taste the love. Amazingly awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food , had the fried pork chop with jalapeño and was very tasty !! Also tried the pot stickers , Hugh and loved them .. Definitely will return !"}
{"text":"China Chili is one of those places you visit when you want something you know you'll like and need to get in and out really quickly.  I started working on Central and Indian School just around the time China Chili closed prior to the lightrail construction, so my first experience was at the new place.  I wish had gotten the opportunity to eat at the original location just to see if the experience was any better.

I have ordered two things at China Chili: the orange chicken and the sesame chicken.  I only order the former now.  I have never had to wait longer than five minutes for an order.  This is good yet slightly unnerving.  It makes me feel as though everything is ready-to-serve in the back, even though the freshness and temperature of the food says otherwise.  The orange chicken is out of this world.  An entire breast fillet is battered, deep-fried, sliced, and covered with a really delicious orange sauce.  If you ask for it extra spicy, be prepared to feel your face melt off.  The consistency of the heat level is a bit hit-or-miss, but when they get it right, you'll be simultaneously pleased and in pain.

My biggest beef with this place is the wait staff.  Very rarely is service pleasant.  Most of the waitresses are brusque and a bit too efficient for my liking.  When the dining room isn't full, they tend to huddle up near the kitchen and watch the patrons as they eat, usually talking quietly amongst themselves.  It is quite unsettling and makes me feel as though I'm not welcome.  The one exception is one of the very sweet older women who reminds me a bit of my grandma in that she always has a smile and is always so quick to ask if I need a refill.  I don't know her name, but I always hope she's there when I go.

So, visit China Chili when you're in a hurry and craving the best darn orange chicken you'll ever have.  Also, beware of really terrible parking options."}
{"text":"Some girl I know said she went to China Chili and it was the best Chinese food she's ever had. After she told me that I went to China Chili the next day. The menu is standard for a Chinese restaurant nothing special. We ordered some beef dish for our meal and a side of chow mein. The beef was chewy and the chow mein was bland. I do not understand why people love China Chili. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy!"}
{"text":"Go there for lunch about twice a week.  Portions are great and the service is very good too.  Their food is also very good and different in some cases where I've been pleasantly surprised.  Will continue going there and will recommend."}
{"text":"oh no no no no!  i ordered the tofu and um, well, it was silken tofu.  i would figure that they would know which tofu to use and how to cook it but i was so unhappy with my meal.  i will never return and i would just like to forget about the whole thing."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night.  We were sat quickly and efficiently.  We had great service, great food and great service.  

Yes I said service twice because man the wait staff is attentive and kind.  They serve the first round of the food to you and made sure our drinks were topped off.   

The food is excellent and high quality.  The menu has a lot of variety.  It was a great dinner.  

Only four stars because this was our first visit.  I am sure this will go to five stars soon as we will be back."}
{"text":"This is the Best Chinese place in town. I used to live 3 miles away and would order Take Out often. I have since moved to North Phoenix and STILL make the drive for Take Out...it is THAT GOOD. I recommend the Salt and Pepper Shrimp ( I eat that as an appetizer) and the Hong Kong Crispy Noodles...YUM. Service is Fast and Friendly."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch with my coworkers and this place exceeded my expectations! They are. Dry quick to take your order and the food comes out really quick, which is great when you have an hour lunch. I order the house chicken lunch special which comes with soup, egg roll, and white rice. The chicken is REAL! It's very yummy and the rice was cooked to perfection. I definitely plan on coming back. I see why people would complain about the service but honestly I rather them get my order right and be quick."}
{"text":"In a town where Mexican joints outnumber their Chinese counterparts by like 50 to 1, you've got to find those rare oriental gems and keep them close.  China Chili wears the crown in the relatively uncrowded field of Chinese entrants.  

Take a group of friends and order 5 or different dishes to sample, just make sure that one of them is the Honey Walnut Prawns.  A good Chinese meal to ensure that your palette gets the much needed diversity that it deserves."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic as usual. Sometimes the service can be a little slow but it is always worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food! But the best part is the service! Drinks stay full and the servers are happy and quick. Lunch special is a good bargain. I got House Special chicken and very much enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Just not good

Today my lunch companion and I were  in the mood for Chinese cuisine so we thought we would give China Chile a try. It has been a long time since I last visited China Chile.  I realized China Chile receives many positive reviews but to be honest, it just wasn't good, in my opinion. Maybe I caught them on an off day.

The service is very rushed at China Chile.  We barely sat down and glanced over the menu when the waitress came over, very ready to jot down our order. So we choose our entrees, Orange Chicken, and refreshments.

Pior to our entrees we were given a complimentary bowl of sweet and sour soup, however I just didn't like the taste. The portion sizes at China Chile are large, but the taste of the of the orange chicken was too sweet, salty, and the liberal usage of corn starch everywhere, made for an unpleasant taste and  both our dishes were smothered in sweet & sour sauce, the entrees just weren't good.

Having tried China Chile on several occasions, I have always been disappointed."}
{"text":"easily one of the best places for Chinese food in the central Phoenix area. the food is flavorful and the portions are gigantic!

China Chili's orange chicken has become my baseline for how orange chicken should taste; the sauce has the perfect balance between the sweetness of the oranges and the heat from the chili peppers. Soooo delicious! Also try the salt and pepper chicken.

The service is quick and friendly, you seriously cannot go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"BEST CHINESE FOOD IN PHOENIX! I am completely obsessed with this place. The boiled wontons are my absolute favorite! We've also had the noodles and Mongolian beef and everything was beyond delicious! I will go back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food we have found in AZ.  We live about 25 minutes away and do not hesitate to drive here anytime we want Chinese.  We don't even try places closer to us anymore.  I have not had anything bad here, but our favorites are the hot & sour soup (we get it without shrimp because my husband doesn't like seafood), Szechaun green beans, beef fried rice, hot and spicy Szechaun prawns (you have to try these if you like shrimp), and the holy grail, the salt and pepper chicken.  I dream about it. Really good food here, always a good crowd but still fast efficient service, and they get your order right."}
{"text":"I live downtown and always WANT to love downtown businesses. I'm also aware of China Chili's status as a downtown institution. But the truth is that I've eaten here 3 times, and 2 of those times the food made me literally sick. 

Needless to say, a .333 batting average where \"eating without getting sick\" is what counts for a hit is not particularly impressive. And unfortunately, when I checked the County website to give a fair review regarding their cleanliness record, their entire history is no longer available since they moved to their new location. So I have nothing to report to you, folks, other than I've only eaten here 3 times and my Darwinistic instincts will not allow me to go back.

EDIT to add: I don't want to speculate about something that would harm a restaurant without solid proof. But my reaction to the food here is eerily similar to how I would feel after ingesting MSG. No scientific basis for me to say that. But that's what my gut tells me."}
{"text":"Can't understand the rave reviews, as this is the worst 'chinese' food I've ever encountered.  Most of the entrees are full of zucchini as a filler.   Everything tastes the same."}
{"text":"As this is the first time here, I am quite satisfied with everything we had. Egg foo yon,  orange chicken, house chow mein, and egg drop soup. Prices were excellent..... Now that we have been back several times to eat here, I would recommend this place (and have) to anyone. We always come home with boxes and boxes of food for the next day."}
{"text":"Very good food. Beautiful ambience. I honestly wasn't expecting such a nice place considering the location. Will be going back."}
{"text":"China Chili is not only a 4, it is a very solid 4. I was on my way back to the West Valley, from the East Valley, and did a search on my beloved Yelp for a highly rated Chinese Food joint that was on the way. China Chili kept appearing. We called in the take out order, and it was finished before I arrived. 

We ordered the House Chicken, Spicy Garlic Eggplant, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Fried Shrimp. And... BAM! It was bomb!

The House Chicken was delicious. Garlic-y, with little bit of spicyness to it, and a very subtle nuttyness to it from the oil in the wok. Great texture, great smell... It was fantastic.

I'm not an Eggplant fan, but my gf is, and she ordered it. She said the Eggplant was a 3.5. Good, but not the best she'd ever had.   

The Kung Pao... Again, a very good dish. If there was a complaint, it was that it was a tad heavy on the zucchini in the dish, which was just a tad overcooked. It changed the texture in the dish in an obvious way.

Mongolian Beef. NOM NOM! Perfect. Great flavor, great texture. Very happy with the dish. 

The Breaded Shrimp was perfect. I can only handle so much fried shrimp. Tried one, and it was spot on. 

This was a perfect way to end a 15 hour day."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite Chinese places in town.. they make some very special dishes that I just crave!!!

Boiled Wantons
Salt and Pepper Shrimp
Orange Chicken

Ive had other things but for me these dishes are just bursting with flavor! Plus the service is great! They seem genuinely happy to see us when we show up!"}
{"text":"Food is typical of Phoenix Chinese food, very boring. After everything I'd heard of the place, I was expecting alot more.  Was hoping for  along the lines of San Fran, or NYC, , but no such luck. Will not be back. I agree that portions were big and food was delivered fast, but doesn't make a difference if the food isn't good."}
{"text":"Always good! ...Portions are big! ...Great spacious place, lots of tables. ...Always a reliable place for some good Chinese Food!  ;P"}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant provides ordinary, average, middle of the road cuisine. The dishes ordered such as Orange Chicken, Shrimp Fried Rice, Sizzling Beef, and Pork Dumplings did not amaze. This is simply a place where you can come and get full on large portions of food. If you're looking to pack on some weight gains the over sugared sauces in every dish will help you! Nothing about this meal experience was memorable. People with higher standards when it comes to Asian Entrees prepare to disappointed! I had to take stars away also because of China Chili's lack of cleanliness."}
{"text":"Always fast and tastes great.  The only down side is they do not Deliver themselves, but you can use Postmates to get your food delivered.  FL-z31f if you want $50 in free delivery credits too!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to China Chili and it was a great experience. We had a family style dinner for 4 people and it was more than we could eat. All the dishes were outstanding and I would recommend the restaurant for the authentic Chinese food. 

The service was great and everyone were really friendly. Two of our party had been there several times and the staff remembered them by name. Just a great day with friends and great food."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious! They have both good authentic Chinese food and Americanized food, so there's something for everyone! Great service! The owners are so nice and charming! Go there! :)

Did I mention the service there is composed of probably the sweetest waitresses and servers that you will ever find in all of Phoenix? Plus, FAST FAST FAST! :) Love it."}
{"text":"Not ordinarily a fan of Chinese food, I am a fan of China Chili! 

For $10 (and that's with a soft drink) the lunch special portions are huge (like enough to get a box and take home leftovers, huge!) and the Mongolian beef  is an option. 

Service is wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am but that works for a weekday lunch at a place that's 6 miles from the office.

Enjoyed dinner here with the family a few weeks back and service had a much more enjoyable pace.

Food has been consistently tasty. I like the batter they use for items like the lemon and orange chicken, etc. and the meat quality is good (i.e. all white meat chicken). 

This place could get me craving Chinese and that's an accomplishment!"}
{"text":"The food is really tasty here.  The decor is like a Chinese version of an old folks home, so I wouldn't say the ambiance is special or even nice.  My daughter's chicken fried rice was delicious and my sweet and sour pork was very good.

The wait staff was not that friendly but that may have been a language barrier--which we like when eating at a Chinese restaurant.  The price was particularly good as our meal cost $25 for two which included a $8 glass of wine."}
{"text":"I was dissatisfied with this place after reading all the rave reviews. We ordered for 3. Pork fried rice, lemon chicken, and sweet and sour chicken.

Pork fried rice was way over-cooked. Chewy flavorless pork and little rice rocks were in abundance. It really had no flavor at all. It is hard to mess up this dish, but somehow, they did. 

Sweet and sour chicken. When you open the container and the veg is burnt, we have a problem. Hard over battered and over fried pieces of dry chicken were placed strategicly throughout the box. The sauce... well its sauce alright. Ketchup based. Thick. Gooey. Snot like sauce.

Lemon chicken was ok. Not great, but not bad either. Good bits of chicken. Ok flavor. Sauce was so so. Overall the best of the 3.

Recommendations... go to Mu Shu instead. See the owner there. His name is Gary, he will give you real food. Eat it and be happy. Without the (insert pun here) afterwards."}
{"text":"Thankfully I'm not one of those individuals that are effected by the addition of MSG. Therefore I can enjoy my periodic visit to China Chili with no adverse reactions. 

Quite a bit has already been covered on the expansive room, so I won't dive in to that. And most of my favorite dishes have already been covered in other's reviews so here are the ones that stand out in my mind (that haven't already been described at great length):
* Chicken Corn Chowder - one of my favorite \"I'm sick\" meals. Think egg flower with minced chicken and corn.
* Honey Walnut Prawns - not quite as good as Big Wongs, but damn good!
* Pillow Chicken - minced chicken with a bunch of other crunchy good things, fried up mouth-sized dumpling style and blanketed in black pepper sauce -  yummo! 
*Sichuan Style Green Beans - the menu version is made with pork, but I have them make it vegetarian with extra spice and IT IS TO DIE FOR.

I've never actually experienced the \"frozen vegetables\" that others have suffered, so I have to think that this is more anomaly than practice. They are always willing to alter dishes to my liking (more spice, no meat, different meat, etc.) - this is a HUGE plus in my book because I love spicy Chinese. The staff is Stevia sweet - meaning they are all naturally friendly! And drum role please.... I can call in my order, hop in the car, pick up my food, and get my chopsticks on in front of my own TV within 15 minutes! LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Definitely my new go-to hole in the wall. Great food, huge heaping portions, and a menu that is more a novel than anything else. Decor is a bit dated but who cares. Don't go here for date night. Go there for some of the best comfort chinese food in the phx area."}
{"text":"Can't say this is the most authentic Chinese fare around.  It is however, dependable and tasty.  The lunch menu comes out in a flash, (parking is horrible) but you can actually get in and out within 40 minutes if you have to.  Dinner again is good, nothing mind blowing but worth a try.  Get a mix of the regular dishes and then try out the less ordered stuff  (i.e. they actually do have a secret menu in Chinese, just point and order if you have to)"}
{"text":"Very surprised by the current rating of this spot (4 stars).  People always raved to me how amazing and authentic this place was.  After living in Phoenix for 2 years - I finally gave it a try.

Space - pleasantly surprised.

Food - My mom wondered aloud why she would be served dog food bc she's a person too

Wont go back.  

Go to New Hong Kong or Szechuan Palace or Panda Express or PF Changs for better asian food."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Phoenix.  I've been going to China Chili since it's original location on Central and Osborn and followed it like many of its fans to its much larger location which accommodates all of its patrons.

I don't usually bother writing reviews for places that have over 50 reviews but after reading some of the reviews, I want to set things straight.

First of all, I've been to the Chinese Cultural Center and am not a fan whatsoever.  China Chili blows the Cultural Center out of the water.

The beauty of China Chili (and only you regulars know this), they will make everything made-to-order.  In other words, if you want white meat only, with just light sauce and medium spice, they will do it just like that and deliver it steaming hot to your table within 5 minutes.  

The wait staff, if you get to know them, are extremely nice, kind and so sweet.  They may not be too chatty but don't take it personal. 

So next time, if you want your Chinese food in a certain way, just ask.  They will give you exactly what you want."}
{"text":"I went with two friends to China Chili for lunch this afternoon. It was very meh. I had the chicken salad (chicken breast, lettuce, cilantro with hot mustard and sesame oil) and a side of white rice. It was very bland. If it had hot mustard and sesame oil on it, I totally missed it. The rice wasn't cooked well at all...seriously, WTF? The soup that came out beforehand was nothing to write home about. My two dining companions had the tofu and said it was not very filling at all and that is was just OK.  

The lunch menu is not very large and to me seems to be quite lacking in some staple Chinese dishes that you would expect. The prices were pretty standard for a Chinese restaurant. Thankfully service was fast and pleasant."}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot of good things about China Chili, and decided it was time we checked it out.
Now the setting is great. Beautiful inside, the server was friendly, but the food itself was very average and a little overpriced. I wanted to give this place a 5-star review, but I feel like I'd be lying to myself and anyone reading this. Perhaps I'll try it again during their lunch special, and not feel like it wasn't worth the money spent."}
{"text":"So my first experience here was not so hot. The dishes we ordered were pretty bland (all needed a generous amount of soy sauce). The one thing I did enjoy were the pot-stickers and the yummy dipping sauce. I ended up pouring that pure yummyness all over my main entree. To tell you the truth, I was hesitant on trying this place again until I took a peek at some reviews and found people had lots of good things to say about the place.

So i gave it another shot. The atmosphere in this place is like sitting in large asian shoe box, it's one big dining room, yet it's not off-putting. It's strangely welcoming. You feel like your family with everyone else eating there. I went on a Saturday night and I was surprised to see so many old people. I'm all \"this place has to be good if the older crowd is here\". The  psychedelic plastic lighting fixtures cycling through all the colors of the rainbow makes me laugh but I love it. The service is quick and attentive, however when we tried to order a Mountain Dew and Dr. Pepper, the small asian woman had no idea what we were talking about and blurted out something I could not make out. I heard \"Coke\" in the jumble of words and just said \"yes\". They work as a team there which makes for some speedy service. We ordered a few appetizers: Pot-Stickers and Crab  Puffs. The Pot Stickers were good but the Crab Puffs were not. The inside lacked any crab at all and had a runny constancy that quite frankly, surprised me. Eww. Avoid these. I remember reading a review from Alexander C. suggesting the Orange Chicken. What a great choice! The dish made up for the runny crab puffs. The meat was top notch; moist with no grizzly chunks like a lot of places have. The sauce was bursting with flavor and had just the right amount of heat to it. I highly recommend this dish.

China Chili...glad I gave it another shot :)"}
{"text":"update on the chinese chicken salad: you can order it WITHOUT breading!
i like to get this to-go, with extra lettuce (or i add extra at home) and dressing on the side... i add an avocado to it and BAM! instant heaven salad."}
{"text":"China Chili always has good Chinese food for when I'm in need of it. I love the fact that they also do catering, and I was able to cater a big party and they made accommodations to substitute two dishes that were not on their catering menu. It was a huge hit, and everyone loved it. I've also ordered takeout a few times now from them, and I've been satisfied every time. Their portions are pretty large. One dish plus a box of rice will last me three meals! Although the taste here is a little Americanized, I do like their chicken with black bean sauce. That is usually my go-to. The vegetables are very fresh, and the meats are always cooked well. When I order ahead for takeout, they have the food ready in about ten minutes. Even for catering, I think I only had to put in the order a day or two ahead. The staff here are usually pretty friendly too."}
{"text":"People... the Peking Duck. 

I went here once for a lunch and was not particularly impressed. Seemed like fairly run of the mill Chinese food. Then my girlfriend started telling me about how great Peking duck in NYC is, so I started on a quest to find it in Phoenix.

It's here.

To be fair, I had never had this dish before, so I don't have a lot to compare it to. But my then girlfriend (now fiancee, in no small part because she introduced me to Peking duck) has had it many times and we were both enthralled with the dish at China Chili. It's kind of a unique experience as well as your server will assemble what are essentially succulent duck tacos (duck slices wrapped in Mandarin pancakes) right at your table.

I'm not going full 5 stars because I haven't been particularly impressed with anything else here and the ambiance is nothing to get excited about, but the duck is most certainly a 5-start entree."}
{"text":"Love their food, very fast efficient service."}
{"text":"It's been hard to find decent Chinese food in Phoenix, but this is the exception with great food! The Hot and Sour Soup was super spicy, but really good.  Be sure and order the Orange Chicken, it was great.  Not the usual super deep fried chicken.  This was moist and the sauce was so tasty.  I look forward to returning and trying more dishes."}
{"text":"There aren't many options for Chinese food in Phoenix, but this is definitely the best."}
{"text":"I'm having a moment with China Chili. I kind of forgot it existed, and then I went there on Christmas day eve and was blown away! We shared orange chicken, mongolian beef, and chicken chow mein. Everything was so fresh and delicious, but I was specifically enchanted by the orange chicken. And the chow mein. Honestly, I couldn't stop eating it because it was so good! The chow mein is especially flavorful and addicting, I dream of it. I'm looking forward to coming here more often."}
{"text":"Food was average. Service was GREAT!... The only memorable thing was: Open on 12/25"}
{"text":"Thank you David and Lisa S for introducing us to China Chli this past Friday night!

We're always on the lookout for good Chinese in the Valley, and now we have another option (not too far from home) with China Chili.  I didn't expect CC to be such a large restaurant, and they were hopping to boot!  The atmosphere was welcoming - casual and old school; I especially love the disco ball in the main dining room.  The servers are serious and efficient, perhaps because they don't speak much English, but with so many customers, it works out fine... I imagine most people are there for the food anyways.

So without further adieu, here's what we ordered for our family-style dinner:

-Pot Stickers (I didn't have these but everyone else did and enjoyed them!)
-Sizzling Rice Soup
-Honey Walnut Prawns
-Sichuan Style String Beans (we ordered with no pork and extra spicy thanks to a tip I found in Julie P's yelp review)
-House Chow Fun Noodles
-One of their house special steak dishes (I think it was Sizzling Black Pepper Beef in a dark sauce).

Yes, I know, that's a lot of food for four people but we did have plenty of leftovers and I liked everything that I ate!

Thank you -  (Xièxiè) - China Chili, David and Lisa, for a memorable meal!  I look forward to returning soon to try some of my other Chinese favorites!"}
{"text":"What a nice change pf pace from all the others.  The restaurant is wide open with plenty of room.  Portion size was enormous - one side of pork fried rice could be enough for 4 adults.  Orange chicken was a-ok, a little heavy on the sauce.

4 stars for the price!"}
{"text":"Good but not amazing. 

And, not terribly authentic, it seems. My exchange-student son said his Hong Kong-style noodles ($8.95) were not like he'd ever eaten in his home town (of Hong Kong), but he gobbled them up anyway. 

I though the menu was very diverse and appealing, but very pricey compared to other similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Service 5 stars, we were first timers and they rolled the red carpet out. We came for a late lunch and they gave us the lunch special prices. The Mongolian beef was excellent!!5/5 the Szechwan chicken 3/5. Came with lots of vegetables which was nice. Bottom line is we were impressed by their service with a smile,speed, and quality of food."}
{"text":"Too salty.. prices are reasonable but not worth it.. the quality is just not there..  too bad it's a really nice restaurant location."}
{"text":"Good location off your choice of major arterials. Parking isn't abundant but isn't bad for a near downtown restaurant. Spacious, neat and clean dining area with some window seating. 1:00 Saturday afternoon we were seated promptly and as hide bound water drinkers, we were given our drinks pronto. All the servers seem to work together so there are no time gaps. 

We looked over the menu and ordered a seafood soup, salty fish and chicken fried rice and Kung Pao seafood. The excellent seafood soup came first and fast. It was very tasty and was entirely consumed by the time our entrees showed up. The other two weren't bad but weren't great either. We ate our fill and took the remainder as carry out. Our server boxed and bagged it at the table. My opinions on the food are a matter of detail regarding fish not salty and squid overcooked...I've had both these dishes at other places and I'll stand with my opinion.

I think that with a few visits to identify  the cooks best talents, this  could be a fine neighborhood Chinese restaurant, worthy of regular patronage."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food! A friend recommended this place to us and coming from Flagstaff where there is no Chinese food, we were so happy to eat here. Attentive service, nice atmosphere, and very large portions. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great Chinese Food! Real Chicken served fresh unlike the double fried chicken you get at most places. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I go here during my lunch break it is fast and easy. Prices are decent and the staff is always friendly. Anything you order turns out tasty. Only down side is it is salty so be prepared to drink a ton of water. And if you can split the lunch plate it's enough for two!"}
{"text":"China Chili is my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Phoenix. They prepare their food the way you would at home without the typical mystery meat. The menu is full of lot's of choices. One of my favorites is the Honey Walnut Prawns. The Pillow Tofu is good even if you don't like Tofu. One of the Vegetable dishes (sides) that they are known for is their Spicy Garlic Eggplant.  The servings are large though, so consider sharing and getting a couple of items. The Chicken Salad is a great summer lunch dish. It is great to go. The managers are some of the nicest people you will meet."}
{"text":"I had an instant craving for some Chinese take-out and fortunately there were 15 minuets left before closing so I hit China Chili on the speed dial. I ordered the House Chow Mien which was ready just as I walked through the door. I could feel my food still sizzling through the Styrofoam to-go container. I couldn't get home fast enough and the smell from the back seat was so tempting I was close to pulling off to the side of the road and diving in. So I get home rip open the plastic bag to find my noddles steaming and filled with shrimp, pork, chicken, and scallions. This was one delicious meal (way better than Pei Wei) and the portion was huge for just under $9 bucks. I stuffed my face crazy and sill have enough for left overs or until I get hungry again in the next hour or so."}
{"text":"My comrades and I were craving good Chinese food and this place delivered! The Lovers Prawns dish was terrific!"}
{"text":"I showed up here to meet a couple of coworkers for lunch.  We work in different buildings so we decided to get lunch outside for a Friday treat.  I got there and thought that the only parking they have is the 6 spaces out front.  I learned later you can park all along the side and back of the building.  HA!  

We walked in and was quickly greeted and seated.  3 seconds go by and a serve shows up ready to take our drink order.  She came back in like 30 seconds with the drinks.  And asked for our food order.  We were not ready and asked for a few mins.  She looked away from us and walked away.  She did not seem happy we were not ready.  =(  We quickly scanned the lunch menu and made our choices.  She was back in 3 mins. We ordered and she was happily on her way.  =)  

I got the house special chicken, I asked for not spicy (SORRY, I am a whimp).  It was tender white meat lightly battered & fried then covered in special garlic sauce and served with a egg roll.  It was a nice garlic sauce (not too garlicy to kill all your coworkers but just a good amount).  The chicken was completed cooked, tender, and juicy.  But before all that we got chicken corn soup, not bad at all.  Food was not too shabby!

Overall it was a quick lunch and taste good.  I am a full and happy camper.  Now back to work!!!"}
{"text":"China Chili is a main stable for good reliable Chinese food.
Lunches here are affordable, fast with a great variety of Chinese specialities. Lunch hours are packed, best right after 1pm.  Dinners are also popular here with weekends being a time for a full house. Like most restaurants this place has some not to be missed dishes. The boiled wanton soup is so good! You must try the boiled wanton and its spicy, peanut goodness! This is great shared before your meal. The Honey Walnut Prawns here are amongst the best I've ever had. The orange chicken is overly fried, pick around the fried chicken and enjoy a mildly spicy orange sauce. The Mongolian Beef is also a favorite. The restaurant does use an abundant amount of onion scallions, I often ask to omit them. The staff here is generally very attentive and you can customize your dishes. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ended up here by accident but I'm glad we stopped by!  Service is very attentive here, and we were quickly seated.  We ordered the cheese crab puffs and the potstickers.  I'd pass on the cheese puffs, they had a bizarre flavor, that I still can't put my finger on.  The pot stickers were perfect.  I ordered the pepper beef and it was very good.  The red and green peppers were cooked just perfectly so they were not too soft or crisp and the beef was also done just right with the perfect amount of pepper sauce.  It came with white rice, which I'm not use to, since I usually have brown, but that was fine also.  Decor is fine, a little 60's china-ish but it seems to suit the place.  From the diverse crowd that was there last night enjoying themselves, it seems they agree with me.  This place is a hit."}
{"text":"This place is on the way home from my yoga studio, and I had been wanting to try it for a while. The building looks small from the outside, but is rather large inside. 

Location: 3rd St and Flower. Parking is limited in front, and there's some in back but not a ton. 

Food: OK but not overly impressed. I guess I think my food was rather bland.  I got the vegetables with white sauce, which is not advertised as spicy but just had very little flavor. That said, the vegetables were cooked well and not too mushy and not too underdone either -just right!"}
{"text":"Always solid. My kid's favorite for sit-down or take-out classics. We stopped here on Saturday afternoon with friends who had never been. My daughter had (as always) beef chow fun. Fat rice noodles, tons of scallions and onions. Just a big ol' plate of comfort food. Sweet & sour chicken for her friend, who loved it. We shared a delicious salt & pepper shrimp dish, some hot & sour soup and crispy that was as good as I've had anywhere. Bonus points to the server for taking the time to speak in Mandarin with my daughter's friend, who is 2 years into learning to speak the language."}
{"text":"Always FAST and Tasty!!! The staff are always great especially the young man that always waits on me. THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Chinese food. It's always fresh and yummy. I typically get the orange chicken with rice. The chicken is white breast meat and not prepared the typical deep fried way. Also their soups are good. Everything is always great and super fast takeout!"}
{"text":"First time sitting in China Chili and so glad that I did as I was able to get their fresh wonton soup. (Unfortunately I could not remember the name of the soup--thank goodness the table behind me was eating it and I was able to point it out the waitress) The wonton soup came with 8 large wontons, broccoli, chicken, green onions, and other Chinese vegetables in a savory white broth. The soup came out in a large bowl and was piping hot--almost burned my tongue a couple of times, but it was worth it as it was very flavorful and not too salty.The soup with tax came to $8, which was a surprise as I thought that it would be more for the size. I would definitely come back here for lunch as the price you pay for the amount of food that you get and the quality is great. The only negatives was the service (the waiters stood around not too far from our table looking extremely bored) and the chicken corn chowder soup, which was bland and left a lot to be desired. I only ate it because I was very hungry and had to wait 15 minutes for my friend to show up (smile)"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to China Chili in about four years and a business trip had me staying right around the corner.  Something has changed big time!  The kung pao chicken was disappointing and the beef fried rice had a strange flavor."}
{"text":"ordered the mapo tofu and the hong kong style beef for takeout. the mapo tofu tasted like hot and spicy soup and the hong kong style beef only filled up half the takeout box for $13. overpriced Chinese food and only tasted mediocre at most. not coming back again"}
{"text":"Food exceeded expectations. Waitress was quietly attentive. We are discerning Chinese diners and will definitely come back.  Spicy Hunan Tofu very nice!"}
{"text":"Incredible food. Make sure to try their boiled wontons - delicious!"}
{"text":"Being kind of picky about Chinese food, you will never get me to a Chinese restaurant where there isn't a single Chinese patron. That being said, the food here really is as good as everyone says. The ginger scallion lobster had a fantastic flavorful sauce. The salt and pepper chicken wings were fried to a nice light crisp with jalapeño and garlic flavor. The green beans were saucy and with kick of spice. Those were my least favorite since they didn't taste like Szechuan dry fried beans at all-- they were sweet and sour and very saucy, but I still enjoyed them. If I lived in Phoenix, this would be one of my go to spots for takeout."}
{"text":"We went to this place after an appointment at the VA and it's so good! The crowd is eclectic, the staff is fast and attentive, and the food is good and authentic. The lunch special is very reasonable, portions are great, they have bomb sweet and sour soup, and it's a very low key environment. It's not fancy, but that's charming."}
{"text":"I was craving Hong Kong style chow mein really bad so I busted my Yelp app and China Chili was one of the first on the list. We got to the restaurant and were seated promptly. 

Our order: crab puffs, salt and pepper shrimp and Hong Kong style chow mein. We first got our crab puffs and they were slim. Once I started eating them, there was practically no crab meat. For $6, what a rip! Then we get the chow mein and shrimp. The entrees weren't any better because they were bland, bland, bland! I was so disappointed. Service was practically non-existent and what we paid was definitely not worth it. I'm probably not going to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I needed to cater a lunch for an office meeting and decided to take a chance on China Chili even though they don't deliver. The lack of delivery option is really the only bad thing I can say about China Chili. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, my order was ready exactly when I asked for it to be, everyone at the meeting loved their various dishes, serving sizes were generous (especially for lunch specials), and the prices were very reasonable.  I was advised by my staff in no uncertain terms that we should cater with China Chili again, and I would certainly return on my own."}
{"text":"Large portions, fast take out service! I recommend the salt n pepper chicken and house special chicken. I'd stay away from egg rolls and soup though, didn't care for them"}
{"text":"I have tried this place 4 times because its supposed to be good but each time the food has been less than mediocre.  Ive tried 4 different basic items from the lunch menu and they were all equally flavorless."}
{"text":"Great tasting food. Me and my wife were trying to find a great chinese restaurant that we could enjoy together since all the other ones we went to were not that great. We ordered Lemon Chicken with their chicken fried rice. Really big portions to share so we only needed one order of each! It was delicious!! The food got to us within 15minutes! Awesome atmosphere and nice service! Only problem is limited parking!"}
{"text":"Walked out when I realized they put MSG in their food. :S
I have tasted their take out before at a family
Members house. It was delicious which is what brought me into the restaurant. But when I asked if they use MSG they said yes. Rather get of PF changs or pei Wei. Even Panda Express doesn't use msg. It's bad stuff."}
{"text":"Your food will arrive in less than two minutes!  Its almost magical.  My personal favorite is the orange chicken.  The chicken is very lightly breaded and the sauce is the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  Delicious!  The one and only downside, the inevitable sodium-induced post-lunch coma."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!! This place is amazing. Everything is homemade and the real deal. It's so hard to find good Chinese food here in Arizona and this place is just awesome."}
{"text":"Love love love China Chili. We've been searching for a good Chinese food place for years ever since our old standby closed down and we've finally located a winner! My favorite is the Mongolian chicken, crab puffs, and fried rice. The service is prompt and the place is huge and comfortable. One of our new favorites!"}
{"text":"Good food, fast service, and convenient location. This place is very busy, and parking can be a problem."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the whole on Phoenix metro!!! I come every chance I get! The staff are always very friendly and the service is lightening fast. Be sure to try the Boiled Wonton appetizer; a Pad Thai-esque broth with delicious pork dumplings boiled in it. A great way to start your meal! I hope this place is around for a long long time!"}
{"text":"Place is always packed, food only  so so.  Had better.  Wife had mongolian chicken,  all onions"}
{"text":"Ample open seating area, with generous proportions. We've gone as a group, ordered different plates and have just all shared everything. My go to is the Kung pap chicken and sizzling rice soup."}
{"text":"Standard American-ized Chinese food.
Will sub tofu for any meat of any dish.
Huge, HUGE menu.
Super fast service.
EXTREMELY strong cocktails.
My father and SO both openly love it.

Sold."}
{"text":"My first time at the China Chili on a trip up from Tucson.  I am a critical reviewer on Yelp--- but I can't find one criticism  for this place ( maybe clean their carpets).

All was piping hot and so so good-- and we will return"}

PLEASE for the love of god
bottle that orange chicken sauce
and sell it

keep making the best orange chicken

don't think panda express orange chicken
this is on a whole other level or orange chicken
just an entire chicken breast
that is incredibly juicy and tender
lightly (very lightly) breaded and fried
with this incredible sauce
wish i was there right now"}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times, but usually just for takeout as there is nothing better than laying in bed, eating Chinese, and watching a movie.  I was never totally impressed but it's the closest Chinese restaurant to my house and so I went back.  

Then one magical day I decided to dine in.  It was a momentous day indeed.  It was the day I discovered the trick to China Chili.  You see you need to go in.  Sit down.  Order way more than you are going to eat.  Munch a bit at the table.  Then get the rest wrapped up.  For some reason if you call in a to go order the food is not nearly as good.  

Favorites you ask?  Well, thanks for asking.  All time favorite is the pillow chicken.  It tastes just like foil chicken but is much larger with out the hassle of all the foil.  Next favorite?  Anything with scallops.  Seriously the cooks in the back must have a PhD in scallopology.  They are consistently cooked to perfection.    Last but not least is the egg foo young.  It's not on the menu but ask and ye shall receive.  

The only reason this place doesn't get a fifth star from me is the take-out.  Food is delicious and service is ridiculously good.  I wish I didn't have to play the games I do but will continue to do so to ensure great take-out."}
{"text":"The Orange Chicken is no joke. Breaded and fried perfectly, so that the breading accentuates the dish, doesn't detract from it. Wife got vegetable dish also very good, but get the Orange Chicken, will not disappoint. Sauce is worth getting by itself."}
{"text":"What can I say about China Chili that hasn't already been said in glowing write-ups in local magazines and the Arizona Republic? Probably not much. But, because you adore me, I'm going to throw in my opinion anyway. You're welcome.

I first encountered China Chili while it was still operating at it's doomed Central Avenue location. Of course it wasn't doomed due to bad food, lousy service or any other detriment other than the light rail project's existence. So, it moved. 

After about 9 months it's back and ready to serve some of the best Chinese food in town. I've yet to venture to the part of the menu that offers duck, but I've tried several beef, chicken and pork dishes and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. My current favorite is the orange beef. Slightly sweet and a bit spicy, it's cooked golden and crispy and makes my tongue extremely happy. 

The dining room is wide open. No booths. All tables. The volume can get a little loud when there are many patrons, and there usually... there are many patrons.  

One thing that sets them apart from other Chinese places I've tried is the way that some of the chicken dishes are prepared. Typically, little bites of chicken are battered, fried and covered in sauce. At China Chili, the entire cut of chicken is battered, THEN sliced and covered in sauce. This makes it visually more appealing and you aren't consuming so much batter and grease.

I'll be back many times in the future so I can get my Chili on."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't done a review for this place. So far nothing I've had in the valley compared. Coming from the Bay Area I have high standards for Asian food and this is so far my most favorite place to go. All the food has met and exceeded my expectations. Hot and sour is just right although I add extra vinegar and hot paste. Lol. Hunan beef is one of my favorite things to get even though it's not on the menu they make it for me. Eggplant is bomb and all the apps are yummy. I love the fact that you get refills on drinks too!! Prices are reasonable decor is ok but those things are secondary for me. Big seating area and prompt service with parking close to downtown keeps me coming back! You won't be disappointed I know I haven't!"}
{"text":"So I heard this was the best Chinese place in Phoenix. I hope not. 

PROS: The staff is efficient. They are on point from entry to exit.

The place is very large and can accommodate tons of guests. I went after the lunch rush and there were just a handful of people in there.

The tallest soda cups. 

Quick Service. My food is was out in less than 5  minutes after ordering. 

I ordered the Orange Chicken. It's always good to try the popular dish at the new place to see how they prepare it.

Cons: It did not look very appeasing to the eye. It sorta looked just slopped together. Presentation is key with me.

WAAAAAYYYY too saucey! The chicken and rice were drowned in the sauce. I could not even finish it.

Maybe I need to try another dish or maybe just order the sauce on the side next time, but I'm still looking for the best Chinese food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"It's very hard to find decent Chinese food in Phoenix and this place is your standard fare. The house chicken and vegetable chow mein were very good as well as the vegetable spring roll. They're set up in what looks like a banquet hall which is a little weird at first but I do like how open it is. Definitely come with a group and order a few plates to share. We couldn't finish the two dishes between us - tons of left overs!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  Love the calamari.  Lunch specials are great and cheap."}
{"text":"My review:

Please understand that I am a hard rater.  I rarely award more than 3 stars.  My definition of 3 stars is a good, solid meal with good service.  It is a place that I recommend you try and a place I will likely return to.  

The food here was tasty and the value for what you pay is within reason.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Both made for a positive dining experience.

Today I began with a large bowl (enough for 4!) of chicken corn chowder.  I found it to be slightly bland.  Next was sweet and sour chicken and house fried rice.  Both good.

I was disappointed that they did not offer combination plates.  Everything was ala carte (Sat).

Take a chance and eat here.  I think you will enjoy it.  Tell them Chris S. from Yelp sent you.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but you may get a good laugh out of it!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from China Chili, after leaving my choice for lunch up to Urbanspoon today. I mean, I'm really broke nowadays, and I regret when I spend the little money I do have on so-so food, and I kinda regret today... 

They offer lunch combos here, but today's side soup was something with pork in it, so I had to get something else. I ordered the Vegetable Chow Fun, and it had no flavor to it what so ever. I'm serious, just nothing. The vegetables tasted ok, the rice noodles we're ok. but mostly this was just a bland dish. I have put the remainders of it in the refrigerator in hopes it will taste better tomorrow. 

The staff was courteous and pointed me to the takeout desk. While I was waiting for my food, which wasn't long it was done pretty quickly, I took a good look at the place. It looked for the most part to be clean and reminded me of the halls that people rent out for those 20K budget weddings. Many family style tables and flat screens on the walls, with \"Chinese\" decorations scattered in between. Wait, did I see pseudochandeliers with multicolored lights? I think I did..."}
{"text":"If i could give China Chili less than one star, I would.

Friends keep dragging me there because it is walking distance from their offices.  If they keep insisting on China Chili, i might have to show up too late to get lunch. I have never had a good meal there. The worst was mushu that tasted like the vegetables in it were canned."}
{"text":"A good restaurant for a nice family dinner. My friend had the seafood duck dish and I had the spicy pepper chicken with garlic sauce and brown rice. We shared hot and sour soup. 

My friend liked The duck seafood dish. I also liked my chicken pepper dish but for me it was too greasy and too much sauce. The soup was good and we both liked it. I'd definitely recommend coming here as it's nice, quiet and service is good and fast."}
{"text":"Yum. Great place to be a regular. All the hot tea you can drink, fresh and homemade dishes. The Salt and Pepper Calamari is unbelievable! Seriously, one of the best dishes in Phoenix....salty, spicy, rich. My #1 pick for local Chinese food"}
{"text":"I like Chinese food! The Waiter was patient and friendly, what's more, the dishes are so delicious. My friend ordered a piece of Set meal named Phoenix with me. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"So ill start off by saying the food here is good but nothing spectacular. But for me what makes this place somewhere I go back consistently is that the service here is so quick that i can eat there within my 30 minutes i get for my work."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. You can never go wrong with China Chili. Also they are open christmas day! Great service dining in and great for take out."}
{"text":"I hate to be a Debbie Downer because clearly so many people love this place, but it's not for me. I have tried many times to like their food but I just can't! China Chili gets ordered regularly  in my office and every time I take a taste I am disappointed. Their fried rice is terrible. Not a single veggie or egg piece to be found. Chicken is rubbery and the sauces always tastes a little off."}
{"text":"This is my homey Chinese to-go spot. Whenever I don't want to cook, I called them and then picked it up."}
{"text":"If you want great food, fast service and good prices, make sure to come here. Lunch is fast and ready to go. Service is impeccable without being overbearing. It is a no frills, but clean place. Originally located on Central, it was moved to this big old building during the Light Rail construction. There are some amazing things that are not on the lunch menu but they serve when requested. Don't miss the Boiled Wontons. I go out of my way to eat here whenever possible, which isn't often enough."}
{"text":"SSSSSSS-boy is it hot at China Chili! And I don't mean because the AC has gone on the fritz. It's because China Chili frequently lives up to its name as one of the hottest Chinese eateries in town!!

The old Central Avenue hangout was forced to move due to Light Rail [hisss] but that' OK because it all ended up for the best--they're now in a lot bigger building on 3rd Street! Which means that you can get in for some great food much faster than ever.

The service is fast, the food is above average Asian fare, those who love hot n' spicy Chinese are in luck too--they have plenty of hot stuff here. 

You may even see Her Honor the Guv here, I have it on good authority that this is one of her favorite dives--oops, I meant restraurants [it's not REALLY a dive any more since they moved to the new digs]."}
{"text":"I read all the great reviews from China Chili and I hate to say it, but I disagree with many of them. I think one of the biggest things to consider is how many different styles of Asian cuisine there are. Maybe I just don't like this type of Chinese food?? The dishes I have tried have varied anywhere from their house special chicken to the their Mongolian beef and their deep fried prawns. Every dish I have had from here have been made with good quality ingredients and have been prepared nicely but to me the flavor just isn't there. My fiancée really likes their food however, which is the reason I've eaten it on several different occasions. If I do order from here, I typically get the Pillow Chicken which is good and had a really interesting (in a good way) texture. I love a good hot and sour soup, and again their soup just doesn't quite do it for me for some reason. The service here has always been good, take out has been fast and efficient, and the lot is seemingly always packed. So on this one, I'll just chalk it up to personal taste, which is just a confirmation that everyone is different - which is fine with me."}
{"text":"I just love this place. Have been coming for years but not very regularly. I'm never disappointed. Great selection of dinners, nice portions, and real moist and plump chicken. Got n sour soup is outstanding. Need to come back now often."}
{"text":"I like china Chili..

Definitely would come back. I always end up going here maybe 1 every two months. I like specific dishes they have here. Chicken Salad  and Salt and Peppered pork. definitely order those if i come...mostly because it is a craving. I can't turn down jalapenos. :)"}
{"text":"China chili is about a mile up the street from where I live. The food is pretty good and the service is great as well. This is a sit down Chinese restaurant type of place. Food price is average but you get a lot of good for the buck. I have been here a few times and I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"The orange chicken and house rice were perfect together.  We added in a pork dish and it was a great combo.  They seated us quickly and had our drinks out right away.  The server checked on us consistently but wasn't annoying!"}
{"text":"I was told this is some of the best Chinese food in Phoenix. It doesn't really compare to what you can find in LA, but for Phoenix, it's a definitely thumbs up. My favorite dish here was probably the least Chinese dish of all - chicken salad. I'd get that again for sure - in Phoenix or LA!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! I love China Chili. This place is perfect. Great food, timely fashion and clean. Super great service. A must try if you're in the down town area. Simply amazing. I cannot say enough great things about this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm only half Asian so I'm not sure if my opinion counts. tho the price is cheap and the service is lightning fast the food does not stack up.  yet the place was packed.  

There was enough oil on my food for me to deep fry my thanksgiving turkey, luckily it was not peanut oil otherwise i would have ask for a to go box."}
{"text":"I swear. Some friends never steer me wrong when it comes to deliciousness. 

I was told the house special chicken is the thing to try at China Chili. However, after looking at the menu, and discovering an item by the name of pillow chicken that included the phrase \"pillow shaped morsels\" how could I resist? There was none of that resistance crap. That food was in my belly fast! The pillow chicken was chicken mixed with onion, bamboo shoot and I believe something else and breaded into little pillow sized wonder. It was laid on top of steamed broccoli and then covered in a black pepper sauce. I wish it was spiced with something more than pepper, but other than that I have no complaints. It was so filling (in the good way, not the I'm gonna get sick way like most Chinese I have) I was only able to eat half. 

I loved the huge round tables in the center with the lazy susans. They reminded me of ones at a fantastic restaurant near where I grew up. The inside is really spacious and has some fantastic traditional decor. The menu was so large that I found several things I'd like to try next time including a whole section of chow fun food. Fun? Yep. I'd like some.

Downside? The parking lot is tiny and narrow. Parking in a space perfectly if there are cars on both sides of the spot is a feat I'd love to see mastered."}
{"text":"Now this is my joint, when I am looking for real , let me say it again, real Chinese food. I mean I want take out, I want fried shrimp and I want to walk away feeling like I just added enough food to my system to sleep through the winter , I come to this place. This is my number 1 Chinese take out place. Please do yourself a favor and just order from here. They actually fill your order with the items you want. You want a side of coconut shrimp , you will be eating more shrimp than bread trust me. If you get chicken lo trust me, you will get more meat in there than filler . love this place ."}
{"text":"Food was horrible. I would never ever go there again. It was weired because we got our food served after like 2 minutes we ordered it. I'm not sure if they served us some leftover food because they did not have enough time to cook all the food we ordered in under 5 minutes. 
We got a fried rice, which was not too bad. But the orange chicken we got felt undercooked and the beef we got seemed overcooked. We returned the beef because it was not edible. Overall not a good experience"}
{"text":"It was just ok for me. I went for lunch on 4/21/16 and ordered the kung pao shrimp. I asked for it to be extra spicy and only got two extra chili peppers. The egg roll was not great... The insides were soggy and not very tasty. I'll go back though, it's as good as it's probably going to get in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Got take out from here for the first time.  The parking situation is bad. Their lot is too small for venue size so you end up parking in a gravel lot behind the business behind the restaurant. The food is okay.  Pot stickers and spring rolls were good but at the end of the Hunan Chicken I wasn't as satisfied as I was hoping.  The flavors were not as deep and seasoned as I have had with this dish."}
{"text":"Second time here, and it was way better than the first time. Got the Spicy Orange Chicken and it was really good!

First review: Meh..I got the Sweet and Sour Prawns and I was unimpressed. All I could taste was the breading. But my friend got the Spicy Orange Chicken and he thought it was perfect. Another buddy got the Mongolian Beef, but it should be called Mongolian Onion because that's all there was on his plate. They are fast at lunch which is a plus."}
{"text":"Went for my third time its good, but my food was not as hot and it had of a funny taste."}
{"text":"yet again, we are spoiled with such a great spot so close to home. 

we have been coming here for 5 years now, and it never lets down. CC is the closest to the east coast style Chinese i grew up with in NJ here in phx, and everything we have tried is delicious! affordable, accomodating, only warninig is that the best stuff here is all fried- not the place to come on your well-behaved days. if you are ok with getting stuffed, grab some pot stickers, fried prawns and the salt-and-pepper pork, then go home and take a nap. grab a bowl of boiled wontons for later!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Great customer service! The outside and inside are very nice and it is very clean. I ordered sesame beef and it was okay. I expected it to be crispy and sweet like sesame chicken, but it fell a little flat. I would definitely go back and try them again because this was only my first visit."}
{"text":"Best not to order the Sesame Chicken, it's unrecognizable and bland. Also they have a House Specialty Chicken that a staff member likened to General Tao's chicken~ it was terrible, we didn't even bring it home for the dogs. A friend recommended the chicken corn chowder, and while she seemed happy, no one else @ our table (of 8) liked it. The crab puffs sucked. And while I'm complaining they have no egg rolls on the menu, only spring, and they don't have crispy noodles. I didn't like their sweet & sour sauce either, too runny, dripping out of bottles, you couldn't get enough of it to stay on the food. We got the last parking space (upon our arrival @ 6:30pm) although there were only 6 seated tables. Naturally, waiting for someone to leave so you can park is less than ideal.

On the other hand they have wonderful potstickers, perfect potsticker sauce too. We were also VERY happy with the Mongolian Beef. They have a chicken dish called \"pillows\", I know it sounds strange, but It's good~ I spooned the potsticker sauce inside, yum."}
{"text":"I've been here 5-6 times over the years. I know it's got a decent reputation and always seems busy but I have never been highly impressed with the food. Nothing that bad, but I was never just delighted by my meal. The kung pao chicken I got tonight was at best average tasting and they gave a small portion of steamed rice. The vegetable egg roll was odd. They were sliced in half diagonally and very greasy. I have gotten better food from hole in the wall places. But you can do a lot worse than China Chili."}
{"text":"I hear that in China, people can be very pushy, even rude, by American standards, shouting across a dining room, ordering their servers around.

Don't worry, no such behavior will be necessary here. All the servers are speedy and attentive. Expect to order drinks within seconds of sitting down and food arrives faster than McDonald's. 

One of the cleanest and largest Asian restaurants I've seen. They have family sized tables with a huge turntable in the middle. 

Lunches are large enough to share and dinner is family style.

The shrimp dishes are particularly exceptional, large and always de-veined. Try the \"prawns with vegetables\" or \"honey walnut prawns.\" 

Sizzling black pepper beef is great too."}
{"text":"Wanting to go to a Chinese restaurant that wasn't a buffet, I stopped by China Chili in Central Phoenix. The inside is a vast room filled with beautiful chandelier lighting and stunning Chinese artwork. Looked pretty fancy for the price, so it's a good choice to take someone special with the apperance you have money. I asked for a small table in the back corner to eat in peace among the sparse group of younger and older people present. 

Menu was quite large, with a deep selection of various choices. I was feeling seafood tonight, so I went with the Kung Pao Calamari which according to the menu is spicy and hot. Faster than I could say Toa chie, the dish arrived. No joke, the server walked into the kitchen and the food came out in about 2 minutes. That's insane and impressive. 

The Kung Pao Calamari in presentation was great and looked delicious on the oval plate. Red, green bell peppers, cucumbers, peanuts and of course the calamari. Scooped up some calamari with various bits of vegetables and upon first impression it was quite good, although the calamari was fairly rubbery more than what I'm used to. The chewing went on longer than I was hoping. Good nonetheless and acceptable. Portion of food was more than adequate with a side of rice as is customary. I did not sense any spiciness to the food which I found disappointing as I do love a little kick in my seafood. I'd honestly like to try something else next time I come here. I sense the potential here.

Overall, China Chili for the price and the atmosphere it's worth it. I would actually rate this place if I was able, close to 3 and half stars as the food wasn't as dynamic as the more upscale authentic places I've been to but then again I didn't expect that either. If you want Chinese food that has a little more class that doesn't kill your paycheck check out China Chili."}
{"text":"Yes Go to China Chili! 
I was tipped off by a friend to this place...a little bit out of my \"hood\" but what the hey. 
For starters they are good about QUALITY, Yeah I said it QUALITY. We could make wonton soup and let it get mushy and bland. China Chili's is very fresh tasting...lots of mildly crunchy cabbage...YUM! 
My husbands new love affair with Singapore Noodles was once again renewed. He ate almost the entire (giant) portion. 
I was intrigued by Pillow Chicken (where do you find this at other places?...you don't!). Chicken and water chestnuts wrapped in a light almost rice dough...with black pepper sauce. All the right combinations working together to make a great dish! 
Will we go back..YES! Now we just have to drive a bit further to great Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Really good house chow fun!  Meats were not dry!   Usually this level of Chinese food starts with cooked meats and just adds different sugary msg sauces.  While the chicken had been sitting,  it drys out.   Not this place.  
All my meats were juicy and tender.  $9 for a dinner size which was huge. My wife loves the chop suey, and she's picky."}
{"text":"What is the hubub over China Chili?!?! Don't understand the high rating this restaurant is getting?!?

I had not been back to this area for 5+ years and wanted to stay near downtown Phoenix where my friend lives. I looked up high-rated Chinese restaurants in downtown Phoenix and China Chili, of course, came out on top. Well folks, you yelpers here are totally fooled!

First of all when you sit down, the menu gives the impression that this restaurant is a Szechaun or Hunan restaurant. It's NOT! The chefs at this restaurant are Cantonese serving Szechaun and Hunan dishes.

For starters, my friend and I ordered Sizzling Rice Soup. As entrees, we ordered Szechaun Shrimp and Braised Tofu with Beef. I had a hint of what was to come by listening to the waitresses... Surprise! They all were speaking in Cantonese!

The Sizzling Rice Soup was very good. 

The Szechaun Shrimp turned out to be a Sweet and Sour dish...  Shocking! There are almost NO dishes in Szechaun cooking that are Sweet and Sour! It looked nice though, the shrimp was ringed around the plate by thin slices of cucumber. The Braised Tofu with Beef was almost as bad, chemically tenderized beef that probably is used from another dish and dropped in the Braised Tofu. Both dishes were supposed to be HOT... NOT!

The only redeeming thing we got out of this adventure was that our wallets were not affected that much by the experience!

Demographics of Customers @ 6pm - less than 5% Oriental, 40% of capacity.

If you want an authentic Szechaun restaurant, travel down to Tempe to Wong's Place on Baseline Road off of I-60. I will be going there tomorrow night and writing a review which will be more positive than this one!"}
{"text":"Best orange chicken in phoenix--this place has a cult following and great service - green beans are amazing as well as the chow mein! Phoenix's options for great Chinese food in downtown/midtown are limited but China chili is great no matter the context"}
{"text":"He a group of six, all we very happy. We all ordered different items and appetizers and had to bring home food. Portions are large and service was great."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant with very tasty unique dishes. Why am I giving it 5 stars? 
My mom said that she really enjoyed her meal, and was the best Asian dinner she's ever had. 
I was glad to hear that because I liked my food too! 

Although this restaurant is called China Chili, it takes its inspiration from Singapore and Malaysian influences. 

The egg rolls were even different. I was pleased to see that they use rice wrapper instead of the thick flour kind that most Chinese restaurant use. I don't really like those because they are too thick! 

Also, being a vegetarian, I was also very impressed with the vegetable selection here. My roommate ordered the Ma Po Tofu. I ordered the Tofu with green string beans, and my mom ordered the cashew chicken. 

The dishes were prepared to a high standard and served in good-sized portions. 

The service here was quick and friendly, and the prices were very reasonable. Will be back again. :-)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for real authentic Chinese food , you can't go wrong here!! From the Roast duck to the fried rice you can't go wrong !"}
{"text":"I give China Chili 5 stars because it has some treats I can't find anywhere else. I've had quite a few things on their menu and I've only disliked one thing. My favorites include the steamed won-tons (very speesy spicy and sweet at the same time, so my man and I will literally battle if they give us an odd number. It gets bloody.), chicken corn chowder (introduced to me by the harbinger of good soups and even better taste, my dearly departed best friend Andre), mushroom and spinach soup (HUGE meaty mushroom chunks with tofu and spinach in a light chicken broth... it's light but flavorful), and my aforementioned sparring partner/boyfriend is crazy about the salt and pepper beef, which is a reasonable and edible facsimile of pepper spray when you get it made like he does. I can't even swallow the stuff, but he just powers it down like drano in a tub.

We very rarely eat there because the decor is just so tacky, but we love it so much, we ordered out for it on our anniversary. Be that a testament to its deliciousness or our stubbornness is your decision."}
{"text":"When here for lunch great food and very friendly staff :)...gave us free egg rolls,cheese wontons & a soda...I it's the small things that really count! Thanks for the great service and food!!!"}
{"text":"Very delicious and affordable food! I will definitely recommend this place for everyone! Very fast service and fresh food! Nothing more to say."}
{"text":"i have to second deborah's sentiments that just because there are 4 stars doesn't mean it is awesome --- but it's all the things i think a chinese restaurant should be.
1. close to my apartment (ok that's bias but its important to me)
2. really fast. seriously i stopped in and gave them my order and it was ready in less than 15 minutes.
3. tastes good
4. afterwards you feel guilty because you're pretty sure it had 4 days worth of calories in it and its sitting like a rock in your stomach. and the oil is coming out of your pores.

this is what i expect from all chinese restaurants, and i am frankly disappointed when it's not there (pei wei for instance does not have this)... so for that reason, there are 4 stars. it's my local takeout chinese place, and i love it for it... but im pretty sure i'd never actually eat inside."}
{"text":"I ordered one of China Chili's more pedestrian lunch specials: The House Special Chicken.  It tasted...well, pedestrian.  Don't get me wrong, It was not nasty at all.  
I suppose compared to Pillow Chicken, this dish seems like its from a different restaurant altogether. Perhaps I should have cut my teeth on something a little less flamboyant than the Pillow Chicken when I first went here, because each dish I've tried after that has left me disappointed.  

However, keep in mind that I've been ordering off of the lunch special menu lately, and those dishes are usually a little less spectacular on anyone's menu.  But I guess that's no excuse, as anything you serve to your customers should be prepared to the utmost.  

Anyway, today's dish, House Special Chicken...  Its described as battered chicken in a spicy garlic sauce.  Its battered and spicy, but not very garlicy.  Still its decent.  A good taste, just not a very eventful taste.  Of note is how tender and delicious the chicken was.  I felt like taking it and putting in a sandwich.

Again, the soup of the day was the one that I cannot eat.  Don't know what this stuff is...but I guess somebody on this planet must like it.

Oh well, I can either hold this place in high regards related to the lone dinner entree I've tried and downgrade it for the few lackluster dishes I've had afterwards...or I can give them a break since most 'lunch combos' are only good enough to fill stomachs at the office and not to wow the tastebuds.  

Meh.  The stars remain.  I keep going back...so I guess its accurate to state that:  Yay, I am a fan indeed."}
{"text":"Great service, superb food! Definitely a place to take friends & family!  We came for lunch and are leaving with full tummies!"}
{"text":"We tried China Chili for the first time this past Monday with my family, after hearing about it from friends and family for a long time.  The place did not disappoint.  It is clean, spacious, and nicer than some of the other Chinese food dives that we love to frequent.  The service was fast and attentive.  

We ordered the following: West Lake soup, honey walnut prawns, beef chow fun (dry), sesame chicken, mongolian beef, house fried rice, garlic green beans with tofu and Peking pork chop.  Our favorite restaurant is Hong Kong Dining on  24th St and Indian School, but China Chili has some dishes that surpass them.  The West Lake soup was good, not too thick with good flavor.  I thought the garlic green beans were top notch, as were the honey walnut prawns.  Those three dishes I would come back for any day.

The sesame chicken was ok -- it was sliced chicken with sesame sauce poured over it.  I prefer the more Americanized version where individual pieces of chicken are deep fried in a sesame sauce.  I would say the same of the Peking pork chop -- I prefer the dish made by Hong Kong Dining.  CC's seemed to have too much sauce that was maybe a little too sweet.  

All in all a gem of a Chinese restaurant that we will definitely frequent when we are on that side of town!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on the 1st of July, around 6pm and it was a great first experience. The restaurant was super clean. The staff was very friendly and always quick with refills. I don't recall my glass ever getting halfway empty.

We order the Egg Rolls and Crab Cheese Puffs, for appetizers, the eggrolls were different a little small in size but very yummy. The Crab Ragoons were better, filled with cream cheese a little crab and green onion...gave them a good taste. 

For dinner we opted for the Honey Walnut Shrimp, Orange Chicken and Pillow Chicken. We were a little disappointed that we could only get white rice. To get fried rice we would have to order it as an entrée. The Honey Walnut Shrimp was really good, nice size Shrimp with tails removed.  The Orange Chicken was different than normal orange chicken - it reminded me of a buffalo chicken with a sweet kick to it. The Pillow Chicken was something I never had before and personally I did not like it. It reminded me of a crab cake or salmon patty...two things that I do not like; it is a texture issue not a taste issue. 

The staff was willing to box everything up with extra steamed rice. We even order a chicken fried rice and Mu Shu Beef to go, which proved to be very yummy leftovers."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about this being the best Chinese in town, so disappointed!!The people very nice friendly as can be. They get five star's it was the food. I got one of the lunch specials egg drop soup came with it, I added crab cheese puffs.  First there was NO crab in the crab cheese puffs, just cream cheese. (one of my biggest pet peeves when ordering this dish) The soup bowl was not even half full and the soup had no taste. My main entrée was o.k. nothing I would order again Its clear they have a loyal customer base. It may take another try, but for me that wont be anytime soon."}
{"text":"They can make the hot and sour soup with veggie broth, no chicken and no shrimp for vegetarians!!"}
{"text":"I love that we live so close to CC, because our friends from all over the valley come to eat at CC! I have never ordered anything I don't like. The Szechuan Shrimp is my favorite and you can never go wrong with some hot Jasmine tea. Also, the food always comes out so fast and because it's such a large restaurant we never have to wait. To top it all off, the lunch specials are amazing!"}
{"text":"This was very good Chinese food! I'm pretty picky and we really have enjoyed our meals here both times."}
{"text":"remember back in the '80's that Chinese restaurant in malls your dad would take the whole family while mom spent endless hours shopping? where the food was just bland unless you ordered fried battered shrimp drenched in sweet and sour sauce? this place is keeping those memories alive. 

ordered the spicy lover's prawns. not spicy and nothing to love. even the egg rolls were nothing more than fried dough with specks of cabbage thrown in. the prawns with seasonal veggies smelled fishy and was tasteless. 

everything on Yelp has four stars. we chose this place out of convenience. i'd rather make the drive to Scottsdale and eat decent Chinese food next time."}
{"text":"Best value for a spicy, tasty lunch. The servings are generous enough that I almost always have food to take home. Lunch comes with soup -- the good days are Monday and Thursday; that's when they have hot and sour soup. The other days is some kind of egg drop with corn (too bland for me). You also get a cute, little vegetarian egg roll.

In order of wonderfulness, try the Kung pao fish, Kung Pao shrimp, Mongolian beef, and Szechuan green beans. I've only ever tried the spicy stuff, so I can't comment on the other offerings.

The wait staff is ALWAYS friendly and amazingly efficient. 

The dinner menu is good, but the lunch is the best value."}
{"text":"The orange chicken is great. This place is always packed."}
{"text":"We went this past Saturday with my sister-in-law and her husband.  She works in the area and suggested we go to dinner here. 

I was extremely pleased with our meal.  We started with Egg Rolls, Pot Stickers and Boiled Won Tons.  The egg rolls were crispy and flavorful, the pot stickers were plump and the filling was delish, but the star for me was the boiled won tons.  I have never had anything like them, They were packed full of meat and served in this savory peanut flavored broth. My sister-in-law was a little wary of trying one, but she did and concurred that they were quite good.  She is not the most adventurous eater so that is really saying something!

For our main courses we  shared Mongolian Beef, Peking Shrimp, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, and Sichuan Beef.  The Mongolian Beef was tender and seasoned perfectly, The Peking Shrimp had a spicy red sauce the had a little tang to is and was served with snow peas (nice and crunchy not over cooked) and onions.  The salt and pepper shrimp were fried with a nice light batter that was salty but not over done and the jalapeno peppers were just right.  The Sichuan  Beef was my least favorite, I thought the sauce made the batter a little soggy but I really liked that sauce so was still a good dish.

The portions are huge, I was full after the appetizers as were my dinner companions, so we took a lot of our dinner home, and it tasted great the next day.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  I especially appreciated that she boxed up our leftovers instead of just dropping off some boxes at the table.

From the outside the restaurant doesn't really look like much, a sand colored stucco building, but inside it is furnished and decorated nicely, the tables are spaced  so that you don't feel crowded and the lighting was bright but not overly so.

My only complaint would be that their tofu dishes had meat in them so there weren't as many vegetarian options as I would have like to have seen.  I didn't get a chance to ask if they can adjust them for vegetarians, but will the next time I go and before I take any of my veggie buddies there."}
{"text":"First time in here, at lunch break. The place was busy and have line to wait for the table. The fun part is you even can share the table with stranger so you can make a new friend, I guess :).
The shrimp spicy was the delicious, the soup was great. The price is even better. I enjoyed everything here and would like to go back to try something else. 
Great place to eat lunch for sure."}
{"text":"Everything was superb.  Egg flour soup, pot stickers, orange chicken --all fantastic.  Great prompt service."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a more traditional Chinese experience for your pallet while in a traditional American setting with actual silverware look no further. Always yummy, it's one of my favorite Chinese places."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Start with the boiled wontons, so much flavor it's to die for. My favorite is the orange chicken, honey walnut prawns, and we love the Mongolian Chicken with string beans instead of onions!!! We have been going to China Chili for the longest time and NEVER EVER had any issues. 

The staff is super attentive and always friendly. The food is always hot and delicious. Sally, the owner is so nice and always comes over to greet us. 

China Chili has to be one of the top Chinese restaurants in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our dinner here. I saw a lot of good recommendations on Szechuan prawns , sauce was great, but it had too much of batter for my liking. BBQ park appetizer was tender, dumplings could have been pan fried for a little bit longer. We will be back to try other dishes. Oh yeah , service was great and fast."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant in Phoenix for a long time. We had heard about this place but for whatever reason never tried it. Well we tried it today and YAY! We found a GREAT CHINESE RESTAURANT!!! We ordered the egg rolls-very good, Curried Chicken-super flavorful with tender chicken (NOT that weird chicken some places have). We ordered it mild knowing it can be pretty spicy. The Beef Chop Suey isn't on the menu but when my mom mentioned it they said WE CAN MAKE IT FOR YOU! The meat was super tender and the dish full of flavor. She said it's the best chop suey she's ever had. They are very happy to alter the meals to your liking. 

The restaurant is pretty. Tablecloths and chandeliers. Service is exceptional. We will definitely be regulars! Try it!!!"}
{"text":"We always call in for take out and the order is always ready with in 10 minutes. Great, fresh and hot is the best way to describe this place. Over 4 years of coming here we have only been disappointed once. Not a bad record."}
{"text":"Yummy!!

It is expensive but they do serve a lot of food so it's worth it.

China Chili has delicious chow mein and crab puffs.

The parking is TERRIBLE, parking on the side of the building is easier if there are spaces but it's usually packed full of people and cars."}
{"text":"So yummy & so fast! House special chicken & orange chicken are my favorites. Plus they use all white chicken breasts. I love that \"spicy\" dishes can be ordered a little more mild; satisfies the entire lunch group dining together."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, I was seated and order taken right away.  I was only given the lunch special menu, and they brought my soup (hot & sour) no kidding within  2 minutes of placing my order.  The soup was great, I was only half way through when my entrée arrived, I ordered sweet and sour chicken.  The serving was large, easily enough for 2 meals.  It was ok, nothing to get excited about but....what I didn't like is the pieces are huge, like a breast cut in 4 very long strands.  I could not get a knife, so it was hard to eat the chicken, it wasn't tough meat but it didn't cut well with a fork.  I didn't like my leftovers enough to take them with me.

They are really fast so if you're in a hurry at lunch it's worth I try.  I'll probably try them a couple more times and would like to view the full menu.  

If you dig hot and sour soup, you should definitely try theirs.  Nom!!!"}
{"text":"We had the boiled wontons because another reviewer said they were so good and they were awesome!!  The Honey Walnuts Prawns were also AMAZING!! Chinese comfort food!! Very good place & highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This was good standard Chinese fare.  Great for large groups"}
{"text":"I wouldnt say the best but certainly was good. The orange chicken is nothing short of amazing. Real chicken. Very fulfilling. Loud restaurant, lots of people. Id def come back and try other items! The cashew chicken wasnt my favorite."}
{"text":"I love going to China Chili for lunch because they are so fast! The food is delicious too!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to China Chili in a few years and decided to go with a group of six. The food was decent, my only issue was the speed of the food and service. The speed of the food - was Extremely fast.  Why would that be an issue? We ordered 7 different dishes and from ordering to delivery was 5-7 minutes literally. The restaurant must precook the food and then when it's ordered, they throw some sauce on it and warm it up. For the service - we had to beg and stop the servers for water refills, more rice and getting the check. A water refill shouldn't take longer then preparing 7 dishes."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for years and really can't think of a single complaint! Food is always fresh and delicious and the staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"It's not that good, it's just convenient and well-known. At least it's exceptionally an quick option for takeaway. 

Orange chicken is usually a safe dish, but this one was just drowning in sauce. There is so much vinegar in this sauce, it bothered my eyes as I opened my styrofoam box. Oh my goodness, I am kind of impressed because I have never had that happen to me. There's really not much complexity, however. Just sugar, vinegar, green onions, and maybe orange as an afterthought. 

The veggie egg rolls that come with combos are tiny and some of the greasiest ever. 

The egg drop soup is totally bogus. 

As for my dining companion's meal, they were not a fan of the kung pao (?) shrimp. Loaded with veggies, it looked a bit more appetizing. But it was loaded with salt, as well as what I believe to be chicken broth, which is a strange choice. 

Look, it's not like this place is a disaster. I'd eat it again...if someone else were buying. I don't really feel like coming back."}
{"text":"This place is addicting, I've been coming here for years and I can count 2 times that the food hasn't been up to par, other than that, it's always fresh, fast and great tasting.

Their prices did increase when the move occurred but I think most people expected it, their previous location was bursting at the seams."}
{"text":"Woohoo Chinese food!  Found out about this place from neighbors.  It's close enough to walk from my new condo.  Great service.  Once you step inside you get the feeling that you are in San Francisco for Chinese dining.  We loved the walnut fried prawns and the chicken curry!  This will be my new go-to place for Chinese food (dine in and take out).  China Chili, I'm glad you're nearby."}
{"text":"My husband grew up eating at this restaurant since he was young. From the staff to the food, there is nothing to complain about. We love so many different dishes here, but if we have to narrow it down to 3 it is... extra spicy orange chicken, salt and pepper calamari, and the Szechwan shrimp.

The orange chicken is whole chicken breast that is breaded instead of little nuggets. You get more chicken than a ton of breading. The orange sauce is amazing, especially with some spice.

The salt and pepper calamari.. may not seem all that exciting or exotic, but it is delicious! I love the favors the green onions and jalapeño with the salt and pepper. 

Our newest favorite dish is the Szechwan shrimp. It is different from what I had growing up. I don't like szechwan anything, so I would have never given this dish a second glance. Of course one day, my friend ordered it and I just about died! I know I am pretty optimistic with my reviews, but I mean it, this dish is delicious and weirdly refreshing. It has undertones of cilantro and it comes with cucumbers!"}
{"text":"Yeah not so bad Chinese food, big portions, family style.  The service, does not go out of their way but does their job very well.  
This would be a classic 3 and a half stars.  
I like plates that come out sizzling from the heat.  This is a nice place to have a larger group sit down and eat family style.

Look for their sign off 3rd st."}
{"text":"We have been searching for a great Chinese restaurant in the Phoenix area for 14 years, After reading so many great reviews I thought this would be it. Sadly, it isn't.. We had such high expectations but I give this a C+ at best. We ordered takeout. When we got home, the Salt & Pepper Chicken we ordered turned out to be very chewy Salt & Pepper Calamari. Our Orange Chicken had very little heat and although it was listed as lightly battered and fried ours had no batter on it at all and appeared to have been sauted instead. The fried rice was decent as was the Pork Egg Fu Yung but nothing to get excited about. So the search continues."}
{"text":"Incredibly fast lunch time service, and you get a pretty complete meal for the price. I have really enjoyed everything I've ordered from here. Entrées are dominated by rich and flavorful spices. Rather than overloading you with heat, they manage to have sauces that are tangy, sweet, and spicy simultaneously."}
{"text":"We have only recently become a regular at China Chili! The food is fresh and beautifully served. I am a big fan of won ton soup and theirs can't be beat. The prices are good and the service is quite pleasant. This has got to be a stop if you are in the mood for any kind of Chinese food as the menu is quite extensive."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for affordable and tasty Asian lunches is the China Chile Restaurant (302 East Flower Street, Phoenix, AZ 85012). The Lunch Specials Menu offers a variety of mild and spicy dishes reasonably priced. I prefer the spicy dishes that are characterized by the restaurant's namesake. My normal selections are the \"Spicy\" Kung Pao Shrimp or Kung Pao Chicken which come with an egg roll, steamed Jasmine white rice and a complimentary cup of the Soup of the Day. I am always amazed by the efficiency of the restaurant staff. The meals are served fresh and at lightning speed. I highly recommend this eatery if you are looking for a quick and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Took my daughters here, so the adventures were already going to be limited.
Ordered the pot stickers, which were delicious.

We ordered beef, chicken, and pork chow mein, and shared it amongst us.

The dishes were large, and delicious.

The spicy relish they provide on the table is amazing.

I have been wanting to go here, and I'm glad I did. I will probably be back."}
{"text":"Perfect for a Quick lunch. And I mean seriously quick. Like ninja light speed fast. 

Under two minutes consistently from order to table. How can you beat that! One time they clock-in at 1min 45sec for a table of five. 

My favorites are the House Special Chicken, the Orange chicken and the Prawns. can't go wrong and you will leave stuffed and satisfied."}
{"text":"everything was fresh and super good, def coming here again when i'm in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The seating is just a bunch of tables in a big room. The food is fantastic! You should go as a group and share dishes, as the portions are quite large.  The service is great and it's a nice place to share conversation and good eats with friends."}
{"text":"By far the closest I can get to China Town here in AZ!!!

I have eaten in numerous Chinese restaurants including buffets here in AZ and by far this is the best one I have tried.

The BBQ pork with veggies, house chow ming, Thai noodles, snow pea beef, Peking duck etc.. All are great.

They have always since day one of me and my family eating here, have given us excellent customer service and served us with a smile.

I recommend this restaurant to anyone felling nostalgic from being far from China Town in LA or San Fran! 

Try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The orange chicken is very popular with my coworkers. In fact, some would eat there everyday if they could. I think their food is mediocre at best although they give very large portions and their service is very, very fast."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

This review is more like 3.5 stars.  It's also going to be way more effusive in its praise than the 3.5 stars it deserves.

If I'm to be completely and totally honest with myself, this is a good but average Chinese restaurant.  Or rather, Chinese-American restaurant, as the vast majority of the dishes are not traditionally Chinese but more Chinese-American (think sweet and sour whatever, Mongolian beef, etc.)  Also, I can only speak to the lunchtime experience as I've only been here for lunch.

Despite all this mediocrity, I LOVE this place.  Not sure why.  I order the house special chicken almost every time I come.  A fried chicken cutlet, sliced, covered in a slightly spicy brown sauce.  Served with rice and a small spring roll.  A small bowl of soup also comes with every lunch.  Maybe its because the soup is on your table within 5  minutes.  Maybe it's because you have your food 3 minutes after finishing your soup.  Maybe it's because fried chicken in brown sauce is pretty tasty.  Again, I love this place for its 80's Chinese restaurant kitsch, speedy service, and tasty food.  

I can barely think of a cheesier Chinese joint to love."}
{"text":"Service was SO fast which is great for a working lunch, but I've had better egg drop soup. My friend, who doesn't like eggs at all, was not offered a different option for the egg drop soup. Otherwise, the meal was great. Everything else tastes delicious. I've heard this place is pretty busy, but the day I went it luckily wasn't very packed and we were able to get in and out in no time."}
{"text":"Great Food very tasty and some unique dishes I'd never seen before like Pillow Chicken!  Large portions and nice presentation on plate.  Open cafeteria style dining room.  Prompt waitresses and waiters..."}
{"text":"Wow, that was good Chinese food.  I went at lunch and the place was packed and took about ten minutes to get a table.  The prices were a bit high but you get a ton of food.  Service was good... the staff are all Asian, they want to get you in and out fast which is great...  I'll be back"}
{"text":"Chinese food is one of those things for me... once I find a place I love, I stick with it!

That was the story for my last Chinese Restaurant until they abruptly closed one day without notice...yes I am bitter.  The restaurant I am referring to was a little place called \"Silver Dragon\" south of Dunlap on 19th Ave.  It was the Cheers of Chinese... I walked in and everybody knew me, and immediatley started to make my meal (they would double or triple it, if I had company).  My favorite dish, was called Singapore Rice Noodle.... obviously a rice noodle dish that included stir fried spare ribs, chicken, shrimp, green and yellow onions tossed with a non-spicy curry sauce.

When they closed, I was in a state of depression for nearly two years!!  Until last night, when I happened upon China Chili, not my first visit, but my first SIT DOWN experience with the restuarant.  I do what I have done at every chinese restaurant since Silver Dragon... I opened the menu and went directly to the noodle dishes to see if they offered \"Singapore Rice Noodle\".  Much to the delight of my stomach, they did and it was EXACTLY the same as I remember it at Silver Dragon.

I am already conspiring to have it again today for lunch!!!!  Oh... they have the fastest service here too, not more than five minutes after we ordered appetizers were already coming out!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious before the light-rail pushed it back to 3rd St., and it's still the best Chinese take-out in my area.  I've been about 10-15 times in the past year, and haven't been disappointed yet.  My guaranteed winners:

* Spicy eggplant
* Boiled wontons (in peanut sauce)
* Mongolian beef
* Sliced pork
* Hot and Sour Soup
* Crab puffs
* Green beans with sliced pork

I'm sure there's more--the menu's pretty sizable.  Takeout ready in 10-15 minutes is another big plus, and the dining room is clean and comfortable if you choose to eat there."}
{"text":"China Chili serves up good food, better than PF Changes and less expensive.  I have been there several times and the food and service have always been consistent.   Some Yelpers have complained about the interior, and while I agree that it is not the \"Starbucks corporate America standard\", I think it is very nice for a semi-authentic Chinese food joint, a much better décor than that of Gourmet House of Hong Kong, which offers up better and more authentic Chinese food in a less than appetizing atmosphere.   (GHHK used to be painted pepto pink, but I think they have upgraded to sea foam green).

I really like the sizzling rice soup, it's a nice change from the standards, but the wonton soup is good, and the hot and sour soup is average.  The shrimp/prawn and chicken dishes are tasty, but have been Americanized.  The live seafood options and duck are much more authentic."}
{"text":"Saw the restaurant on Check, Please and decided to hit it for lunch on Friday.  Arrived around 1:00 - still quite a few lunch-goers there but we were seated promptly.  They are geared to get your lunch to you so if you have to get back to work, it won't be their fault if you're late!  While we were still looking at the lunch special menus the server brought us the soup of the day - egg drop with lots of corn in it.  Very tasty.  Wife ordered Mongolian Beef and I ordered House Special Chicken.  Drinks were brought quickly and by the time we were finishing the soup our entrees arrived.  Great lunch servings - large plate filled with entree, rice, and vegetable egg roll.  The egg roll was the only thing about the lunch that I didn't like.  It is one of those very thin fried rolls that I eat by imagining that it's a fried won ton.  But the entrees and rice were excellent and a great value for less than $8.  Will definitely be back for dinner."}
{"text":"The lunchtime service here is so fast they either use cooking ninjas or a microwave. No human can cook this fast.  Maybe the servers read your mind?

Consistent, hot and cheap.  A Phoenix staple... Probably why I see Jerry Colangelo here all the time."}
{"text":"awful, food was not good, people with me got sick and will not go there again."}
{"text":"Negatives first:
The shrimp were not properly deveined. I'm not sure if this is the norm since was my 1st visit.

Positives:
Food - Very flavorful American Chinese. In fact, probably the most flavorful I've had in years. The menu isn't typical either. There are some awesome menu choices.

Parking - Plentiful. There is parking all around the building. And it's needed, the restaurant was super busy this Friday night.

Price - Excellent price points. You get plenty of food without breaking the bank.

I ordered a carry out of the house chicken and the house fried rice. I paid $20.  The portions were large. We had enough for two and have plenty left over.
The sauce on the chicken is yummy goodness. That thing was made with love! It's garlicky without the strong aftertaste. The chicken was fresh and tender. It was well sauced yet the batter was still crispy.
The house fried rice is very good. The rice, cooked well. It is served with chicken, shrimp and beef.

I usually enjoy quaint romantic restaurants, so I don't know if I'd ever dine in. The dining room and kitchen are pretty wide open and bright. No where to have a quiet convo.

China Chili is added to my list of favs while here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for at least 15 years, dating back to its previous location. There are so many good dishes. But there are also some items that are more American dishes that are okay/good, but I wouldn't recommend you ordering them since there are a lot of way better dishes.

So. I'm just going to list my all time favorite dishes :) 
Peking duck. Salad, chicken not fried. Salt and pepper pork chops (but the shrimp and calamari are also good). Spicy prawns. Seafood soup. Beef chow fun. Honey walnut prawns. Boiled wontons (and you can add noodles and make it a meal!). Orange chicken (or beef. It's fried. Who fries beef?! But it's delicious!). Szechwan green beans. 

Please remember you can pretty much customize your order to what you want. If you don't want it fried, just ask. If you don't want MSG (which is in some dishes apparently), just ask. If you want it less or more spicy, just ask. No meat?  Just ask. They try their best to accommodate their customers."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant- great food - amazing service. Duck is wonderful. Kung Pao Fish is terrific. Have never had a bad dish. We dine here regularly always consistent. Hot n sour soup is the best in town."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food, satisfied my orange chicken craving. Got a to go so I don't have any comments on the service. Got orange chicken, rice and a pork appetizer (forgot what it's called). All of it was hot and tasted fresh. Not your typical orange chicken- this was slices of chicken with the orange sauce but it was pretty dang spicy for me. But I'm also a spice wuss, so it could be average spice. We def will be back to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Second visit and it was ON POINT, again!  The food is good, hot and DELICIOUS!  Veggie spring rolls-EXCELLENT! Mongolian chicken-EXCELLENT! The egg drop soup-EXCELLENT!  In the neighborhood-EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"Hooray for the reopening of China Chili!  The new location seems to be much larger than the old one and has way more parking (two lots!).  The decor of the giant dining room is still pretty plain and the music was an odd selection varying between traditional Asian music and Kenny G.  

Ambiance aside, I thoroughly enjoyed my favorite dish, Sweet and Sour Chicken.  It was a radiant shade of orange and simply delicious, as always.  I especially appreciate the fact that they give you a larger portion of your dish than of white rice, a proportion skewed at some other Asian restaurants.  I could have gone for a knife to cut up the giant pieces of chicken that make up the dish, but I powered through. 

I'm generally pretty picky about my Chinese food, but China Chili hasn't yet let me down."}
{"text":"Wanted to branch out and try something new after an appt today. SO GLAD WE CHOSE HERE!!!! The food was not only delicious but we were served in less than 5 minutes. Tip and all out the door with satisfied tummys for less than $20. Needless to say we will def be back!!! If lunch was that great I can only imagine what dinner will be!!! Yummmm!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  It's what you should expect for above-average chinese food in Arizona.  I've been twice, and it was good both times.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food here recommend this place to any first timers looking for a change. Next time I'm back in town I will try this place again"}
{"text":"I've been hunting for a place like this since I moved to Phoenix in 98'.  My wife and I ate here for lunch a couple of weeks ago.  Nothing fancy on the inside or outside but the service and the food are great.  My wife and I shared a plate of the Orange Chicken and a plate of the Mongolian Beef.  They were both great!  Within a minute of ordering, we had the egg drop soup in front of us.  It wasn't the best I've ever had, but above average.  You can't get better service either.  Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I just pulled into the parking lot and felt compelled to write this review before I went inside. China Chili is on my \"top 5 favorite places to eat\" list. The food is SO good and it's out unbelievably fast. Everyone that works here works together to get you what you need and they're all very friendly. I'm here AT LEAST once or twice a month (for the last 6 years). I'm not sure if that's something to brag about, but I'm just being honest. ;) You should eat here! #saltandpepperchicken #beefandbroccoli"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The Orange chicken is awesome, not all breaded up. Order it spicy, it's perfect. Also, get the boiled wontons trust me. And the size versus the price is great. $10 should fill you up easy during lunch. I drive from Happy Valley Rd to go eat here."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch the other day and had the Mongolian Beef, House Chow Mein and Boiled Won Ton. All of them were very good and the service was ridiculously quick with refills, etc. Would like to go back and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Although the view from the street, the front of the building and the decor not too appealing the food by far made me forget easily how the old building looked. Lemon chicken is my new favorite.  Fresh, light breading and NO heavy sugary syrup, actual light and thin sauce."}
{"text":"This is a Phoenix institution and like most such long-lived restaurants it is safe but lacking in edginess. The food is properly prepared and served, but there is little spice to be found. Sauces are mild if slightly oversalted for my taste. The busy but congenial atmosphere works better for lunch than dinner. One positive indicator is the number of Chinese folks who eat here. I certainly would return when it was convenient."}
{"text":"Love this place. Quick for lunch, food is consistent, and very affordable. Friday's are the best because they have the corn showder soup."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food y loved this place everything is good here and good prices in the tow"}
{"text":"Some months ago, my boyfriend took me out for dinner at China Chili and I've been hooked ever since! The food is fabulous! The portions are excellent and I've yet to have something I didn't like. My favorite is the Orange Chicken and the Hot & Sour Soup. These two items have become a staple in our diet. I'm also all about those cream cheese crab puffs, shrimp lo-mein, and the house fried rice.

I've turned several people onto this place and everyone tells me the same thing: OMG! THIS IS THE BEST CHINESE FOOD EVER!!!

If you are looking for a good meal with excellent portion sizes, China Chili is worth the extra $$. Give it a go! You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for lunch. I love the food. If you are on a quick lunch break, you will love the quick turn around. Generally, the time between order and plate averages 5-7 minutes. 

The Chicken with vegetables and brown rice was absolutely delicious. However, I saw those irresistible prawns on my husband's plate and oh my God, they melted in my mouth. BTW, the egg flower and hot and sour soups are great."}
{"text":"China Chili doesn't sound like much, and frankly it doesn't look like much either. But then when I opened the door from the 3rd Street side I was struck with the loud noise of a full house of hungry and happy eaters. So far I've only had the spicy Sichuan prawns, and it delivered. It was a hot, spicy and a wonderful blend of spices including garlic and chilies. Most of the items on the lunch menu were labeled 'spicy', and so hopefully the others are this good too. By the look of the other diners, the smiles seemed to indicate good stuff. The service was efficient and fast, too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food here is better than run-of-the-mill Chinese/Asian, but what really sets it apart is the speed of service.  My friends and I laugh that the staff is almost clairvoyant, because your food will arrive just about the second you finish ordering it.  I particularly like the Orange Chicken, because the sauce and the breading seem very home-made, not processed.   The only downside to its popularity and speed of service is there can be a wait for seating during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"It was ok, but not great. I thought the prices were ok and you do get a lot of food. The service is ridiculously fast...from order to food on the table could not have been 5 minutes.  Would go again but not my first choice."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time as it came recommended to me online. A brief look at the menu and the name China Chili piqued my interest as it may be a Chinese eatery with an emphasis on spice. I'm a full blown Chili addict and a fiend for spicy dishes so I figured I'd give it a shot. 

 Place was nice and clean, had a very well established vibe, and quite a few locals and staff were eating when I popped in. I tried two dishes and had the egg rolls as an opener. None of what I ordered was spicy, even though the menu *indicated that they were. This is not something that I fault them for, since anymore it seems like no one in the valley is actually from here. All snowbirds and transplants from middle American-wherever, who likely piss and pad about their food being \"too spicy\". Perhaps I should have emphasized to make the dishes extra spicy. I've had this experience in the past with what are now some of my favorite places, and had to tell them YES I am absolutely sure I want it extra spicy, or Thai hot or whatever. Next time, I'll be sure to ask. 

 With that being said, while the dishes weren't spiced to my liking, they were absolutely fresh and very delicious and a healthy dose of chili sauce made up for it. House special chicken was fantastic and a definite highlight. Thinly sliced white meat chicken, with a crisp outer layer and a savory brown sauce. Would definitely order again. The food was delicious and the staff was great. When I'm in the midtown central area in the future, I'll be sure to stop in again."}
{"text":"Wow, so this is the mecca of Chinese food in Phoenix? I mean don't get me wrong, I had some enjoyable items, but this is the Macayo's of Chinese restaurants. Undaring dishes with expected flavors delivered witha reasonable price. Now, mind you there is a hell-a-handsome tattooed waiter, who while I'm waiting for my to go food, I do the blue steel, eye lash flicker while I'm puckering up my lips look. While I'm sure I think I look hot and flirty, he and the rest of the staff are hurling up the mid afternoon dim sum. I'm just saying so often the famous favorite that's been around forever can be stale and uninventive. But on a Sunday, the pork lo mein, crab puffs and broccoli and beef nicely soak up the cosmo overdose I suffered at the hands of the previous night bartender who overserved me. The nerve. Chow Mein yelpers!"}
{"text":"Some friends of ours brought us to this place a few days ago.  The food was amazing.  We ordered the Phoenix platter for four people, which gave a salad, appetizer, soup, and about four or five different meals....all of which, awesome.  The food was delicious and fast.  The prawn rolls were my favorite.  Looking forward to going back and trying other things.  My friends who brought us here told us that they have tried nearly everything on the menu and haven't had anything bad there....it's all been great."}
{"text":"You want great chinese food with good prices and service this place is the real deal!! Came here last night everything was on point from the food to service to prices would definetly recommend"}
{"text":"After failing miserably in Scottsdale trying to get decent Chinese food two days ago, I drove 30 minutes to China Chili last night.  I ordered the same dishes that I had two days ago (stir-fried noodles and dumplings) because I seriously wanted to compare the food.  

My reaction: It was pretty good.  

In comparison to the food from couple of days ago, this could have been labelled as being great.  

However, considering that I spent my teenage years working at an awesome Chinese restaurant to pay for my SUV that I rolled off the interstate, I cannot say that this was the best Chinese food that I have ever had.   I'm also a bit of a snob when the dish contains any type of noodles. The noodles I got yesterday were too overcooked and drowned in oil.  It had a good balance of flavor, but again, I don't want to be drinking vegetable oil by spoonfuls either, you know?  The meat and the seafood were in good size and cooked well, so kudos for that.  

I would go back to try some different dishes, but the overall content of the menu seemed quite general to me.   I'm still on the hunt for the best semi-Americanized-Chinese restaurant in the valley yet again this week."}
{"text":"Went on Tuesday with a few people from work. 3 out of the 4 people that went were out with food poisoning having the worst nights of their life. Somewhere between the Sweet & Sour Pork and Lemon Chicken only I remained safe with some decent Sweet & Sour Chicken."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. This is our goto place for bdays and friends and co workers lunch and dinners. Good food at a great price. Quick service for lunch when you only have 30mins."}
{"text":"I'm not surprised to see the wide variance in the ratings for China Chili, to be fair they tend to be incomsistent. It has been a staple for us going back 15 years to their location on Central. We have visitors from SF, Vancouver, NY, LA who are consistently amazed to find Chinese food of this quality in Phoenix. Even if they are the best of Phoenix on a good day, they are not rivals for the 5 stars in those towns though. 
Here's a few tips for getting the most out of China Chile. Don't do take out. Always get a soup, hot n sour is our favorite. Chicken Salad is special. They never miss on spring rolls and pot stickers. Honey walnut prawns get my luv one Jonesing to go there. Orange chicken and orange beef have not disappointed. Noodles have. Chow fun or chow mein should be on your order. They do shell fish superbly, especially scallops. Whole fish is a mixed bag some great, some not so. The pork chops and chashu are a bit dry for my taste. Special menus on the whole have been disappointing. It's boom or bust, but if they offer seared beef tenderloin take the risk. One night I'm raving to fiends about how good it is, at the same time a guy at an adjacent table is complaining to the manager about the very same dish. That's China Chile."}
{"text":"Always great. Always friendly. The four musts: honey walnut prawns, pillow tofu, orange chicken and hot and sour soup. Four of us last night got to have them all- best meal in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I dont like to give bad reviews but the food was bland from the soup of the day, to the House Special chicken to the Kung Pao chicken.   Watered down sauce. Kung Pao had literally 7 peanuts, meat cuts were chewey,  loaded with too much water chestnuts.  They should of named it Water chestnut chicken.
I hope others have a better experience and the recipes improved.  Unfortunately I can not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"To each their own. Maybe cause I grew up in NY? We love Chinese food. And I was hoping this would finally be the place. Honestly in my personal experience I'm not that impressed. Gets 1 star for ambiance, 1 more star because it's an actual restaurant with servers. And the third star is for their menu of choices and some of the items we ordered were pretty good. But why not 4 or even 5 stars... Well..I ordered their house chicken with fried rice. Looked great but no flavor. My daughter ordered Orange chicken, looked exactly the same as my dish but the sauce had a hint of orange..which was not bad but not impressed. Mom had Mongolian beef..tasty but nothing to scream off the top of a mountain. Which is what I was hoping for...from at least one dish. On the other hand their pot stickers was the only and one thing I would go back for, handmade, hearty and flavorful.
Also, the server highly recommended the salt and pork dish for us to take home to my Dad...let's just say it went back in the box and has been in the fridge for a while..sorry."}
{"text":"The quickest lunch in town.  We timed it.... 4 minutes from ordering to it arriving.  Not sure if this is good or bad in some people's eyes but good when you are lunching on a work day and need to get back to the office.  The lunch special prices are phenomenal -- I always get the mongolian beef, it's huge and delicious.  You get soup, your meal, rice and an egg roll. All for under 10 bucks (with a drink) and maybe even tax. 

I love China Chili, something about the colorful disco balls in the giant dining area and the curtness of everyone-- it makes me love it even more.

They do takeout too and it's excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, you are always greeted at the door and never have to ask to a refill. Great Chinese food in general, comes out quick for those in a hurry. Also, I am more willing to drive across town just for their boiled wonton spicy peanut soup - phenomenal"}
{"text":"Wonderful quality food. They have a delicious WonTon Peanut Soup Appetizer that we frequently enjoy. Huge giant shrimp here that is also great. Their Kung Pao is also wonderful.

Very good service and the atmosphere is very nice. Recommend them without reservation. (No pun intended!)"}
{"text":"My favorite is the orange chicken! It's quick & inexpensive... with a far higher quality then you might expect judging from the price!"}
{"text":"I went here with my dad today for lunch at his suggestion. We got here around 11:45 and this place was hopping! We were sat right away and the very efficient servers came and gave us soup straight away. It was egg drop with chicken, which isn't my favorite, but it was ok. We decided to order some potstickers and an order of Hong Kong style noodles with chicken. It took five minutes for them to bring out the food... wow. The potstickers were really good, and the potsticker sauce was a nice balance of savory and sweet. The noodles were also very good. They were crispy, just like I like them. All of the veggies tasted really good, I could taste each veggies' individual flavor. It had snow peas, broccoli, carrots, and celery. It was all really great. So why four stars? I didn't really like the soup so much, I think it is so lame that restaurants give egg drop soup (In my opinion, it is the worst, and what about people with egg allergies?), and also the sauce on the noodles could have been more flavorful. Overall though, this place was really good, and I wouldn't mind going back here again."}
{"text":"Fastest sit down lunch in Phoenix! 

Lunch is always delicious, dinner is great as well!

Service is very efficient.

I'm stuck on the house chicken and the green beans."}
{"text":"We met a fri me here for dinner the other night 
Wow !! I'm very impressed !

Service was excellent and the food was awesome 
Large portions 

A great value !

If in the area again we would for sure stop in here again..."}
{"text":"China Chili is my local go-to Chinese lunch special by work place. The lunch specials are very reasonably priced and they give you huge portions and extras like comped soup and a spring roll. The service is efficient and incredibly fast. The food itself is decent- nothing to get super excited about but good enough to fill you up without being super disappointing. It is best to come here for lunch rather than dinner because they do so much volume at lunch that the food is always freshly made by the time it gets to your table."}
{"text":"House fried rice is really good I haven't sat down to eat there I always order to go. Everything is always neat and clean and the employee are nice. It's a very quit atmosphere."}
{"text":"They have yummy egg drop soup and jasmine tea. I tried their teriyaki chicken and was disappointed in the sauce :/"}
{"text":"It wasn't until going into Frances, the other day, that my husband and I were stopped in our tracks with an amazing smell wafting from The Prime nearby. You know it has to smell good when it is after lunch and he is trying to talk me into stopping in for a \"small bite.\" Yeah right! Well, when we looked at their menu last night, it wasn't cutting our tastes and decided to go for China Chili instead.  I've tried this place before and it was so-so but I believe in second chances. Thank goodness for second chances. We ordered this curry rice noodle dish mixed with chicken and shrimp. That was my favorite part and reminded of the Hamun noodle dish we used to get at the now-defunct Big Wong's. The dish was $9 and was enough for 3 adults. We also had the BBQ beef app ($5) and the egg rolls ($2). I wasn't too much a fan of the egg rolls but everything else was great in my book. Total with a couple bucks tip was $20. I wonder how soon I can talk the husband into going back. Maybe right after our next lunch for a mid-afternoon snack..."}
{"text":"To find out how the culinary skill of any Chinese chef, Ma Po Tofu would be the dish to order because this dish required the knowledge of how to mix the sauce properly.  Sadly, it was a disappointment from two angles:  1) The sauce had too much vinegar to it so it was very tart , 2) the vegetable that came with it was store bought carrots (Ding Ma-square diced) and peas which tells me they didn't invest much preparation on this dish at all and it was served without minced pork which is the absolute essential to this dish.  The restaurant didn't have any Asian patrons which was a bad sign.  In order to have an ethnic restaurant that earn the gold seal of approval, their own community have to support it which this place lacked.   This place may be busy but it isn't my cup of tea just like the way Chinese screw the British and offer them the worst tea (Black TEA) and charge them the most money so if you wanted American style Chinese food, this will be the place to go."}
{"text":"I got the spicy orange chicken here.  Granted being from SF I've become such a snob for what constitutes as good Chinese food.  However, I stepped into this restaurant recently and got myself a delicious meal with my coworkers.  I was really impressed with its authenticity and I'm glad there is a place like this near my work.  Especially with a good lunch special deal."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best place for a quick, affordable meal. The staff are prompt, the restaurant is very clean and I have never been disappointed with my experience. If you're looking for a great place for lunch - you've found it here."}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch date....both impressed. I had the orange chicken, J-Luv had the lemon chicken. I liked his better though....and luckily he learned well in kinder that sharing is caring! Keeper, right? Loved it! Big lunch sizes, and they come with egg rolls and soup. Going back and it is in my neighborhood! :)"}
{"text":"China Chili is great when you want good food FAST.  I don't know how they get their food out so quickly, but it's pretty awesome - especially when you only have an hour lunch break.  I came here for lunch with my co-workers during the lunch rush and we all got our food within ten minutes of ordering.  I also came and ordered to-go after work one day and my food was also ready within ten minutes.

On top of being fast, the quality is there too.  I ordered the seafood blossom soup and it had nice chunks of shrimp and scallop in it and wasn't just all broth.  I also ordered the mapo tofu, which I really liked.  I can't say that its truly \"authentic\" Chinese food, but it's really tasty and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place very skeptically, turns out to be good. Food is priced well, tastes good and service great!"}
{"text":"I went here for my friend's graduation dinner.  We were served the traditional and authentic 10-course banquet-style dinner.  I didn't even know this place existed until that night!  The food is pure Hong Kong style cooking without the unnecessary frills --- just the way I like it!  The food comes hot and fresh and the wait stuff is friendly.  I can't remember every single dish that was served as it was an extremely festive night with lots of loud talking and cheers but I do recall the roasted duck and steamed fish in soy sauce with ginger and onions being amongst my favorite.  

Come for the delicious food and not the atmosphere because this place isn't that cute.  ;D"}
{"text":"I consider this place to be one of Phoenix's hidden gems! The service here is always great and fast! I am a creature of habit when it comes to this place. I always get the house chow fun and hot and sour soup, both are amazing!

I have also been here a couple times for lunch. The dishes are great for lunch portions. Definitely check out this place if you haven't before!"}
{"text":"Very fast service. Servers are so nice. It seems like a clean place. The food is at a decent price and great."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good! The portion sizes are decent so it's really easy to share as well. We tried the shrimp app and some crab angels. Pretty typical for these. The egg flower soup has a ton of veggies and was really delicious and just enough for all 6 of us. We decided to try the lemon chicken, not overly lemony and perfectly cooked. The peppered beef had a ton of onions and peppers, the walnut shrimp were good sized and the sauce was amazing. The star of the show was the veggie chow mein. That dish sounds simple but you could taste how fresh all the veggies were and the noodles have got to be homemade. We got a side of fried rice as well and it had a ton of veggies too! Service was fantastic and we all really liked this place!"}
{"text":"This place is officially our favorite spot for Phoenix Chinese food! Everything we ordered was delicious and the service was top notch. We started with the Egg Drop Soup and then ordered the Chow Mein, Sweet & Sour chicken, and Mongolian Beef entrees. Next time we go we are going to try something different since everything sounded good. The restaurant has a welcoming atmosphere and is great for families since they have large round tables throughout the dining room. I definitely recommend anyone to try this place if they are in the downtown Phoenix area."}
{"text":"NASTY! 

I have lived in Phoenix now for 7 years and have been searching and searching for an up to standard Chinese food restaurant (specifically Sesame Chicken)... and thought I would give this place a try after reading the reviews. 

Another disappointment. The lunch menu is tiny, they didn't even know what Sesame chicken was and my food came out in literally 1 minute which makes me think they have a vat of it sitting in the kitchen pre-made. My  mom ordered the sweet & sour prawns and we were both surprised she could even take a bite to try it... just looked plain nasty. 

The soup was disgusting and offered no choice besides the \"soup of the day\" nasty vegetable eggdrop and I have never before see some of the things that were cooked inside the eggroll. Scary. 

Guessing I will just give up on my search and have to fly into NYC or California for a plate, thank god I am a flight attendant and can do so! 

Such a disappointment Phoenix Chinese food restaurants are, how is there not ONE good go-to? You Phoenicians have no standards when writing these reviews, I will never yelp another Chinese place and take the locals words for it's rating. 

Pei-Wei it is, unforunately :-("}
{"text":"Yummy! Veggie egg rolls are excellent - really interesting, complex flavor. Egg flower soup is full of vegetables and is a lot heartier than I expected.

Lemon chicken is pretty good - not terribly exciting, but not bad by any means. The ma po tofu is really good with a nice, spicy kick.

I'll definitely give China Chili another go round and try out other menu items."}
{"text":"Great Chow Fun! Lunch specials are only OK though."}
{"text":"I would say this is the best Chinese food I've had so far in Phoenix area. Have eaten twice, though both times take out, when having dinner with friends who live close to the restaurant. 

The honey walnut prawns are really tasty, and my other favorite was their eggplant. So delicious!  I wish they were not so far from where we live or I'd go back more often."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Try the orange chicken and the chicken corn chowder soup... It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Best service you will find from a restaurant. The chicken is great, sliced chicken breast, not like the fried nuggets you'll get at other Chinese restaurants. I highly recommend it as a lunch spot."}
{"text":"I love this place! Wish my work was still close to it because I'd eat there at least once a week for lunch.  Their lunch specials are so inexpensive!  We're talking $5-$6 a plate which includes the entree, rice and a cup of soup.  Can't get better than that.  Their service during lunch is amazingly fast.  That way if you only have an hour for lunch, you're in and out with time to spare. 

My most recent review is when 14 of my friends and I went to China Chili for dinner.  We actually planned on going to Gallo Blanco but it was almost a 2 hour wait to accommodate our party.  So off to China Chili we went and there was no wait to boot!  We ordered the peking duck, mongolian beef, house chow mein, fried rice, walnut shrimp, peking pork chops, crispy noodles, ma po tofu...and really, that's all I can remember.  Some of the guys also had beers and sake.  I can't think of one dish that I did not like.  This place does NOT disappoint.  After stuffing our faces, we were delighted that our bill, plus tax and gratuity ended up being $10 a person.  What a deal!!!

I am a huge fan of China Chili!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for hangover food. Excellent life giving food.  When the waiter served our hot and spicy soup I was revived. Absolutely great customer service. Quick and reliable."}
{"text":"We love this place!
They had me at Beef Chow Fun. Our order was at the table so fast. Wine was delightful. We will be back."}
{"text":"There is no way I could say a single bad thing about this place.  Every time I have been here, it is the exact same thing.  The service is quick and attentive, the food is fantastic and brought out freakishly fast, and the meal is always fairly cheap.  Funny thing is, I used to be afraid of this place because of the name.  The husband always wanted to try it, but I said it sounded creepy.  As a side note, I am not a fan of spicy foods.  I have since come to realize I really like Asian spicy, I do not like Mexican spicy.  So I'm a food racist.

Our first time here we ordered the orange chicken and the lemon chicken.  The orange chicken was nice and crispy, with the chicken being super juicy.  The orange sauce was amazing.  It was subtly spicy at first, and then the heat just built up from there.  We still order this every time.  The lemon chicken is nice.  A light sauce that doesn't overpower the chicken.  Another good bet.

Since then we have tried many other dishes, the Almond Cashew Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, and the Honey Walnut Prawns.  Holy Crap!  You have never tasted how good prawns can be until you eat the Honey Walnut Prawns.  The lovely little crustaceans are served on a bed of shredded cabbage.  They are smothered in a sweet and tangy mayo sauce (I know it sounds kind of gross, but trust me and try it).  Then sprinkled all over the top are this wickedly good honey glazed walnuts.  What an amazing dish.

China Chili, I learned my lesson... Never judge a restaurant by it's name."}
{"text":"Good authentic Chinese Food, just need to know what dishes to order and to ask for spicy or non spicy. Good Peking Duck, House Special Chow Mein and Tofu with Cha Sui. 
Very busy during lunch with downtown customers where they will seat you in a table to share with others.
Service is always good and prompt with good prices. 
Pretty clean for a Chinese Restaurant, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in the valley! No frills, lousy decor but delicious food every time. Try the spicy shrimp dish and the tofu and green beans."}
