{"text":"Took kids for a nice evening and as we wete leaving decided to cash in tickets. We Waited 15min at the gift shop for help and saw no staff at the front counter or on the floor. We yelled out for help with no response. Eventually paged overhead for help using their intercom."}
{"text":"An hour into the buffet and this is still what pizzas are available. Kind of a waste of $20 for four people."}
{"text":"Chuck E. Cheese.  It's pretty basic where ever you go.  Pizza. Games. Fun.  Not much more to say.  

(Only I'm not a fan of the pizza, but I won't tell that to the kids who I bring with me on field trips!) At this location the managers are pretty laid back and very helpful.  They are always checking with my coworker or myself if we or the children need anything.  Very helpful staff, though I've noticed that they have a high turnover rate for hosts."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed for the money spent on a birthday. Standing in line for over 10 minutes with one cashier only. The temp was ridiculously hot the whole time. The music is so loud you can't talk to your child. I tried to order an extra cake for the party, assuming it would be quick since it was pre-made, nope. And it came with the employees finger in the side (see pic) It was not well run at all. Will recommend somewhere else to friends. Upon ending the karts and paying I was told I was upgraded and the foodies bags alone were were $50, I was supposed to spend $8.99 per kid, I was charged $20 and upon arguing with the manager I received $10 off. Please don't have a party here."}
{"text":"Never have we ever been treated so poorly. We just threw our son a 2nd bday party here last Friday. We were there 11-1, and home by nap time. On our way home (about 15m drive) I realized we didn't pay, but to reserve the party we used a credit card, and figured that's how it all worked since no one asked us or offered us a bill. As soon as we pulled in the driveway the general manager called. Right off the bat threatening us, as if we tried to dine and dash or something. I asked if he could just use the card we reserved it with and he said they couldnt take payment over the phone and he kept asking why we couldn't drive back. Naptime of course, he asked if we BOTH had to be there for nap time, with 4 kids yes we do! After he hung up on us numerous times, and called the COPS on us (we didn't know about the cops till my husband went back to pay) my husband decided to just go pay. He was soooo rude and called my husband \"shitty\" and kept winking at my husband to be a jerk. We will never go back! Glad our son had a fun time! But we will spend our money elsewhere or until they get a new manager! 

Side note- the employee at the front told my husband that they get complaints all the time on the manager!"}
{"text":"The kids who work here are always very nice considering they deal with other people's children all day. I've been here a few times with my daughter. I wait for the coupons in the mail to save a few dollars because it can get expensive."}
{"text":"At First Glance

The ambiance is fairly casual, I've noticed there's no coat check or dress code. This is my 3rd time in an establishment like this as I never did attend such galas as an adolescent. Quite impressed as a spectator, although I overheard that it was a pretty penny to accommodate a large group with pizza and plates.

Eatery

Classic thin crust pizza in the variety of supreme, pepperoni, and cheese is what we requested and it was most excellent. Thin, cheesey and sticking to the crust is what to expect with the classic flavor. The pepperoni is fortunately not spicy or slimey or uneven like it can be so many times. Most impressed.

Entertainment

Chuck.E came out center stage 3x while I was there. The enthusiasm level seemed somewhat low however I assume the costume helmet is very heavy and cumbersome. There are several tvs playing dance numbers and singing from staff performer groups.

Sanitation

The tabling and play area is clean and well maintained. No smell and neat tables. The bathroom could use some improvement and be tended to more regularly although it is my understanding they are understaffed and it was very busy at the time.

Overall, I'd say this establishment is quite becoming. Quite."}
{"text":"Held a bday party for my 2 year old.  Aaron the District Manager is one of the worse people I have ever dealt with.  Even his employees complain about him behind his back.  I will never do another Chuck E Cheese just for the simple fact that they have selected him to run their stores.  Unprofessional, arrogant, rude, even to the point where I asked to talk with someone else because I refused to talk with people like him, his response \"your talking to me right now aren't you\" and he winked at me as he walked away.  I would highly encourage EVERYONE to not come to this location for your kids birthday party."}
