{"text":"Stopped there on a bus lunch and went back after work great food and nice people"}
{"text":"Thoughtfully prepared and properly cooked cheeseburger on a grilled bun (w/ all the crisp fixins) and an ample serving of freshly cut and crisp fries for $6.45. Bonus is the fine tips on the ketchup and mustard containers that allow you to explore your creative side in application of said condiments."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars mainly bc the bartender there is so awesome! I can't remember her name but she has short blonde hair and a great personality! She makes u feel welcomed there. The food is alright. It literally takes over an hour for the cook to finish cooking my food. And it's been more than once and it turns out over cooked every time. Used to be amazing a few years back. But although the service there is great n very comforting."}
{"text":"I think Rion down there is confused. This place is on the border of Slavic Village and Newburgh Heights on Harvard. The new menu is good, great ambiance. Hard to find a place this nice and clean around that neighborhood especially one that serves quality food. It's a traditional \"bar food\" menu but they have daily specials like potato pancakes and meatloaf that are more of a home-cooked style meal. Must be doing something right as it's normally packed for lunch during the week"}
{"text":"Meh.  For being in Slavic Village this place is an oasis.  Pretty dope beer selection but I cant see anyone in this neighborhood ordering it so I wonder how fresh it is.  Food sounded good but a tad pricey.  Server girl was super nice but wasnt very chatty or anything.  No daily specials with food or beer that I could see.  Maybe thats why I was the only one in there besides some old dude watching Judge Judy talk smack to some deabeat landlord on TV.  Wing nights and happy hour pricing on beers would keep me here longer for sure next time..."}
{"text":"Been here twice and found the food to be very good and reasonably priced. Not your everyday bar food.  Have tried the pulled pork with homemade chips, chicken tortilla soup, cheese steak hoagie and homemade soft pretzel and would recommend all of them.  I hear they have lobster bisque on Fridays. Can't wait to try it"}
