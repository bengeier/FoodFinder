{"text":"This place has such amazing biryani, you can get lamb, veal, chicken, or just the rice.  I haven't had the lamb or veal, so I can't attest to the quality of them.  The rice is fluffy, long-grain basmati, seasoned with saffron and biryani masala, and shockingly, no turmeric.  It is the best I've had anywhere.    The place is a dive in a strip mall (why are these always the best places to eat?!).  Horrible decor, with only 8 or so tables, it's at least clean.    Their curries are amazing, mostly Pakistani style, and very spicy.  The seekh kabaab karahi (sic) was probably the spiciest curry I've ever had, and I absolutely love spicy food. Their butter chicken is superb, thick and creamy with a slightly sweet note.  The chicken tikka masala is loaded with onion and chunky green peppers in a thick tomato gravy, it's a winner.    I'm working my way through the curry list, but everything I've had has been excellent.  I heartily recommend this to lovers of Indian and Pakistani cuisine, you will not be disappointed.  Just stick with take-out, or ignore the pedestrian decor, which won't be hard once you start eating.  My rating might have been a 5, but the sit-down service isn't great, and they often bring me a small garden salad before my meal and while this is a nice gesture, it's not very fresh and has no dressing with or on it.  No thanks to the plain limp lettuce!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place quite a bit.  My last meal here was not very good at all.  We bought about $50 worth of stuff, all the meat dishes were merely bones and the biryani was bland! We decided to give them a shot another time, my wife called them up, starting placing the order and the person on the phone began snapping at her when she asked a couple questions.  I'll never be back now."}
{"text":"This place has very sub standard south Asian food. Ordered naan and chicken tikka once and they were not even cooked properly"}
{"text":"This place surprised me! I must confess I wasn't expecting much when I walked in but the food was delicious.It's a short walk from the Delta hotel where I stayed for 2 weeks and during this I must have tried at least 6 dishes and everyone of them was good .Their Karahi Chicken,biryani and nehari warrant special mention."}
{"text":"Love their Chicken Biryani. (not too oily as Mystic) Good taste but unfortunately I was not a fan of their Curry.  Cheap and affordable pricing for take out."}
{"text":"Tried the takeout bryiani after online suggestions.  Was consistent  ( lamb ) tasting for 5 or 6 times. Service lacking more each visit from on ready to no forks and missing salad thingy.   My last visit I got 2 small pcs of meat and a large bone....."}
