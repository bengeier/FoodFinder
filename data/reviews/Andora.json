{"text":"Food was very good, service right behind that. The only issue was the noise level we could not hear ourselves think, even at our small table of three. It was partially the large group that sat next to us after we had been there for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I was here for a special occasion, and must say that it was not what I expected.  The menu offers a wide variety of options, but you should be sure to ask your server what they suggest as in small restaurants like this they typically know what is better to order.  I got a steak here and was not impressed.  While it was cooked to temperature, the steak was dry and was lacking in seasoning.  For the price, I've had better steaks at Atria's or Bravos in the area.    My girlfriend got the crab cakes, which were great.  I recommend these as an appetizer or an entrée.  Our server was knowledgeable, but she could have known a bit more about the wine list.  That being said, I must mention that they have $20 bottles (A decent variety) that offer value to their customers.  I would go here again and steer clear of the steaks. I feel as if my experience would have been better if my server would have suggested a better entrée."}
{"text":"Overpriced. The food is decent but the menu and decor do not keep up with the times. I want this place to be good since I live so close but it just doesn't do it for me. The outside patio is very nice."}
{"text":"Spent New Years Eve at the restaurant.  Service was great, far better than I expected on New Years Eve!  Still had a romantic cozy feeling even though it was an incredibly busy night.  I had the salmon which was very delicious and my boyfriend had the prime rib which he was very pleased with as well.  Formal atmosphere but not stuffy as I was not looked at rudely for having a short black dress with exposed tattoos!  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"ambiance inside was a pleasant surprise in relation to the outside setting. Seating was quaint and comfortable, allowing for a sense of togetherness. The 1st course (i.e. starters, appetizers,) was appetizing and correctly portioned; ordered the baked brie, roasted beet salad and complimentary bread/ oil. I purchased the ribeye and was a little disappointed with the cut choice by Andora's. The red onion jam that accompanied the steak was great but the cut was mediocre.  Wine selection was great, giving sufficient choice for pairing of all foods on the menu. The server spent the time to talk with each table, keeping patrons satisfied and lively."}
{"text":"A great menu. Virtually everything sounds good. The zucchini ribbons and seafood fettuccine are both excellent and are my favorites. The service is professional. You might be neglected if you choose to dine in the bar, so I suggest getting a regular table. The drinks are first rate, and the atmosphere is elegant. The clientele is a little stuffy for my tastes. Also, if cost is a concern, there are no bargains here."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for awhile and, frankly, it is a schizophrenic place. The ambience is nice. The addition of the louvered screen over the patio make much of the outdoor seating much more useable.   But there have been dramatic changes since the restaurant first opened. Overall, the menu has become much more \"safe\" at the expense of being creative. Seafood preparations are inconsistent (but so are Pittsburgh tastes with respect to how seafood should be prepared).  Expensive seafood (such as scallops) have been replace with cheaper alternatives (chicken) with no change in price. A few weeks ago someone asked for shrimp to be added to the salad and was told that it would be $3/shrimp. 21/30 ct shrimp are $13/lb meaning that 4 shrimp would have bought between 21 and 30 in a bag.  The restaurant's main recommendations are the servers and bartenders, who show the customers great respect and attention, but they seem to be hampered by a management more interested in profit than value. They remember what you like and try, very hard, to remember names, but they seem far less motivated than before (and watch our for surveillance cameras which seem to be everywhere in this place, in case you are in witness protection).  Case in point. A few weeks ago another customer was treated to a glass of white wine which replaced the \"premium\" wine by the glass that they normally serve (if people read my other reviews they'll know that I am of the opinion that Pittsburgh restaurants gouge their customers on wine, charging more than 4x/bottle off the wine store price). The glass price was more than $8, but the wine, which was on sale at the local PLCB store was $9.99 for a 1.5 liter bottle! So ONE GLASS cost the equivalent of 8 pours!  In essence, they substituted a cheaper wine for their \"house\" price, but failed to pass the savings onto the customer. Pittsburghers used to understand value. Perhaps they will, again.  This is not the first time that I have seen this. Awhile back they offered a \"bluefin\" tuna dish as the special but claimed that they had run out and that they would offer a yellowfin for the same price.  Now, there is not THAT much difference in taste between bluefin and yellowfin (since all the good bluefin goes to Japan), but there is certainly a difference in price. And to offer the latter at the same price as the former is ludicrous.  There is lot to recommend this place. The ambience and the staff are at the top of the list. But this was the flagship restaurant of the (now) chain and it seems to have lost a lot of its luster."}
{"text":"Very happy that Andora has come to the South Hills of Pittsburgh.   The food in consistently good and the service is outstanding.  The zucchini ribbons are a must try appetizer.  Both the horseradish crusted Atlantic cod and the grilled salmon were very good.  You could feel comfortable in jeans and golf shirt or in a jacket and tie.  We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Great food, and love the vibe.  Sit out on the patio under the pergola and enjoy the breeze.  Inside is nice too -- cozy on a cool or rainy night. Staff is lovely and attentive. We go here anytime we deserve to celebrate."}
{"text":"Having heard lots of good things and seeing quite a few 4.0+ ratings I figured this would be worth a shot.  1,000's of people can't be wrong, right?     The place was clean and service was great, we had reservations and were seated almost instantly.  The food was a different story.  Very timely but overall just not that good.  Brussel sprout salad read to be very good but was just steamed with some bacon and a splash of oil.  I found it rather disappointing that bacon didn't help make a difference here at all.  Very bland and the addition of pecans seemed out of place with what was served.  I got a steak and portobello ravioli meal that was good but I expected a little more food. They were great but 5 small ravioli just seemed a few too short.  My wife got a chicken dish with numerous small pieces that were dry and chewy.  She elected to get he sauce without tomatoes so perhaps they add a significant amount of taste but otherwise it was quite bland as well.  We chose to pursue desert elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday and split the calamari which was great.  Salads were fantastic and everyone highly enjoyed their meals.  We had the veal, pork tenderloin and snapper special and it was expertly prepared. Service was great also. Nice wine selection too.  Will definitely go back in the summer to enjoy the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"First time I came was in December for lunch with my significant other and was amazed by the interior. The guy I went to lunch with walked me around, showed me the place and told me the history of the building. The staff was very friendly and even though it was my first time there, they really accommodated to everyone's needs. They were very willing to take some time and explain the building and I could tell that everyone involved takes great pride in working there. l The fire place seating area was the best and the food was amazing. The price of food is definitely well worth it."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience we have ever had at a restaurant. We have been going to Andora in Sewickley for years and years. It had always been our favorite resturant.   We will never return! First, on a Sunday, at 6:00P.M., we walk in and the dining room is just about empty. We had reservations for a party of seven. Our waitress was nice, but very inexperienced and dirty. We tried to order our drinks. They had the Pepsi, but no White Zinfandel. Then the special of the day, they were out of. Tried to order appetizers, they were out of shrimp. Tried to order scallops, they were out of them. We asked if we could get our grandson a burger, and she said she had to ask the manager. He told her to ask the cook. After sitting there for 10 minutes with no bread, no appetizers, no reply or visit from the waitress, we left. We did leave money for the two Pepsi's. My husband had even went to talk with the manager. He just said they had had a busy weekend. I truly doubt it, since there was no one in the bar, or dining room, except for two other tables. And only one waitress to be seen.  What a shame! We don't know what has transpired there.  I only gave it one star because I felt I had to."}
{"text":"Went here with another couple for a birthday celebration.  The food was very good. Out waiter was excellent.  He was very knowledgeable regarding the menu and made two great recommendations from the wine list."}
{"text":"Visited Andora with a date on the recommendation of a co-worker.   The location is very convenient, right off the highway but in a wooded area (not sure how bad the bugs are in the summer).  The facility is clean and well-kept.  Dining rooms are beautifully decorated, fancy but not too fancy.  We were there at 6:00 on a weekday and they were near full capacity.  Not chaotic though.  A wide range of clientele, business people to families with kids.  So as nice as the place was I would not go there for a romantic dinner that required quiet conversation.  Here's where it gets weird.  Our server was brimming with attitude, she was way beyond having a bad day.  She was dismissive and rude.  This ruined the whole experience for us.  The food was quite good.  The menu is stocked with basic fare with flare, everything we had was above average in quality.  I would not repeat due to the terrible attitude of our server."}
{"text":"This was our local go-to place, until tonight, unfortunately. We brought guests from out of town and one of their dinners - pork - was undercooked and red. The bigger issue is how this was handled by the manager. Twenty minutes after informing our server, the manager found time to stop by. She told us that the pork entree had been a recurring problem (clearly the issue isn't the pork) and she offered us free desert. It was as if we were eating at a family buffet instead of a nice restaurant. It was noteworthy that the manager was busy hanging coats and hauling firewood, but didn't have the time or inclination to take care of customers or deal with real issues at the restaurant.  Afterwards, an attempt to tell her that we had recommended Andora to many people and discuss our displeasure was met with a debate. We can't in good conscience recommend this restaurant any more. Too bad..."}
{"text":"Andora is a beautiful restaurant inside and out! Tonight we got to sit outside on the back porch. I loved the outside! The back porch had a roof over it but it also had steps which led to a small enclosed back yard with more tables and a beautiful water fountain.  Lily was our waitress, very personable and attentive- always a plus! We started with the Calamari and Chicken Flatbread. Both delicious! The Calamari had an Asian sauce with it, mmm.  The Chicken Flatbread had about seven pieces! It said good for two but you could honestly split it with three to four people.  I stayed simple after our appetizers and had the Shrimp Bisque Soup and Strawberry Fields Salad.  The Shrimp Bisque was good. However, it had two large shrimp in it. I was fully expecting shrimp in the soup (obvi) but it was two randomly large pieces of shrimp ...with tails included... just unthawed and thrown in the soup. It was odd but didn't change how delicious the paste was.  The salad was good, very good. It was topped with Feta cheese, strawberries and sugar coated walnuts plus it was mixed with a balsamic glaze. Hit the spot.  The prices are a bit high. Entrees are anywhere from $20 to $35. I would recommend for a nice romantic night out."}
{"text":"We recently had a wedding rehearsal of 30+ people. Andora was wonderful! The food was unique and delicious. The staff was accommodating and provided excellent service. The setting was comfortable for our group and adequately private.  Both the party planning process and well as the meal service itself were very well handled.  We can't  wait to come back for anniversary meals!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I was here. Had family dinner on Sunday and it was not that crowded.   Our server was great and very attentive.   I had the shrimp bisque. I like to think of myself as a bisque pro. But this was not really a bisque. It was way to oily. You had to stir it each time as not to have an entire bite of oil. You could even see the separation of oil and cream. The shrimp were small but ok.   I had the crab cakes which were great but a little on the smaller side. But the mashed potatoes and veggies were delicious. Plus the plate was filled with them helping to fill the plate.   Had a nice plate of Pinot noir which was a house choice.   Also had a brownie dessert which was amazing.   Overall a great dining experience and looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Had a great meal at Andora last night with my wife, my brother and my sister-in-law who were in from out of town. Food was delicious. We had the pumpkin tortellini, ahi steak, a filet and a crab cake for entrees. All were well prepared, interesting, and very tasty. Nice ambiance, especially the bar and fireplace room in the front. Service was fine and the drinks were good.  All in all, a wonderful evening.  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Great American Cuisine. Haven't  been in a long time but the service is usually a bit delayed sometimes but it really is hit or miss. Summer these guys are completely on their game however. Outside patio is too enjoyable and relaxing! Our waitress and server 'Maddie was one of the best and most professional I have ever had! Terrific try for a casual Saturday night meal with friends or the lady!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite local restaurants but has gone completely down hill. I attended a family party at Andora in Fox Chapel this weekend and was extremely disappointed. When we arrived, the entire staff was standing in the parking lot because no one had a key to get into the restaurant. Then, my kids and I watched as a waiter took a large rock and broke a glass window to the kitchen and climbed in to let us all in. He then had to continue the day serving with bandages on his arms from getting cut. As a result of no one having a key, nothing was ready and no food was prepped. My family member who planned the party was even asked to reschedule her party (as the guests, who came from hours away, had already arrived).  The wait staff was helpful and apologetic but the food took entirely too long, since nothing was prepared prior. Half of the guests were kids and were complaining that they were starving. Then...the kids meals didn't even come out before the adults' meals did. The food, which is typically their strong suit, was sub par. Burgers were burnt to a crisp and were brought out well after the other adults had almost finished their meals. To top it all off, we were over charged after having the whole menu/prices pre-planned with the staff! All in all it was an extremely disappointing experience and the whole thing was very poorly managed. This used to be a favorite place to visit but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love Italian food but this place was a disappointment. The ambience was charming, great for big groups and the wait staff was very friendly. Unfortunately, the food was not anything extraordinary, and definitely not worth the price. The asparagus salad sounded so delicious on menu but when it arrived it was underwhelming and I couldn't even taste the lemon honey dressing on it. The main entrees (especially the fish dishes) were under seasoned. Few of their dishes were delicious though, and if you plan on visiting I would suggest the Andorra chicken (probably their best dish), from the appetizers - shrimp in Thai coconut red curry sauce, lobster mac n cheese and the shrimp bisque."}
{"text":"Live in Texas and my wife and I have eaten here a number of times. I'm a tough grader but always would give this place at least a 4 with an occasional 5. Surprised by there overall rating below 4. This place is better than most of restaurants with a 4.0 rating."}
{"text":"Andora is our favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Great outdoor patio seating in good weather with a beautiful large fountain and flowers and plants surrounding outdoor tables.Had two wonderful meals, scallops cooked to perfection and delicious walleye with a great light sauce. Their crabcake are the best in town. Nice wime selection but also reasonable corkage on BYOB. Nice friendly staff. Great spot for a special occasion dinner and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here many times, and almost every time, we are pleased! Once, I was wearing a white sweater, I spilled pasta sauce, and the waitress got me some club soda to get it out! Definitely a perfect!"}
{"text":"On a Saturday night we had reservations and sat right away, four adults in our party.  We all had salads, 2 house and 2 iceberg wedges.  Nice portions, but not anything extremely fancy.  All tasty!  For dinner we had ahi tuna, Andora chicken (2) and a scallop dish.  My chicken was wonderful!  It came with asparagus, and risotto, and topped with a caper, artichoke and tomato cream sauce.  I asked them to spice it up and it was delish!  Nice size portion, I could have gone for double the risotto because it was so yummy!  My hubby liked the scallops and the other hubby liked the ahi tuna--all beautifully presented.    We had the creme brulee for dessert, the other couple had the bread pudding and cinnamon ice cream.  The creme brulee was not the best I ever had, but it was up there in the top 5!    Noisy!"}
{"text":"We have never been disappointed in the food or service at Andora. The outdoor patio is great in the summer and the bar is laid out well with a nice selection of good wines. The crab cake is the best I have ever tasted. It's not inexpensive but the quality is first class."}
{"text":"Went to Andora with my son at 8pm on a Sat night.  The decor is very traditional and we were by far the youngest people in there, probably by about 30 years, but that's OK, because I'm not there for the crowd or the decorations.  I had an ahi tuna dish that was cooked to perfection.  I asked them to give me the tuna almost still alive and that they did.  It was tender and melty in my mouth, no knife required.  There was a wasabi mango, I almost want to call it a chutney, on top of some rice as a side.  They went a bit heavy on the wasabi, this coming from a sushi lover.  The pours of wine were more than generous.  We didn't have dessert, but they looked incredible as the servers were bringing them out to the other tables.  Our server was outstanding.  Always there when you needed her and a really sweet girl.  We'll go back once we've tried a bunch more places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Am giving three stars based more on their lovely patio seating. The land is more industrial than anything, but you wouldn't really know when you're out on the patio, green lush surrounds you.  The food wasn't that great. The best thing was the calamari for an appetizer. I had the crab cakes with rice and veggies. Absolutely no flavor. So bland. Was veggies with butter and rice with butter, nothing more nothing less.  Would go here if I wanted a nice patio and okay appetizers. But wouldn't suggest going for a good entree."}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's Day. The food and service were fantastic. The server had great suggestions and was well versed in wine pairings. We got the creme brulee for dessert and it was good but not the best. Would definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Crab cakes, salmon salad, everything here is delicious & high quality - - even my son's chicken strips! They should have a much better rating. My only tip is that if you want to save some money, go for lunch. If you do go for dinner, make it a date night."}
{"text":"An interesting old building - it was once a brothel! - from the outside it looks tacky, with signs all along the road causing local cyclists to swerve out in to the road to get past. It tries to be upscale - it says on its web site that it's in Fox Chapel, a posh area, but it's actually not, it's in the next township along. Lying to make yourself sound good is never a good start. However, the prices reflect that they think they're a cut above. Some friends got as far as the door and decided against those prices. The room on the right as you enter used to be, under previous owners, a nice place to sit and chat and have a drink. Now it's crowded with inappropriate tables.  Staff were OK - neither good nor bad. We started with the flatbread which was fine but too much. I ordered Grilled pork tenderloin, balsamic apples and carmelized onions with mashed potatoes and broccolini. Thought it sounded mellow and autumnal. When it came I couldn't taste any of the flavors because it was so highly spiced. I told the waitress that it should have said on the menu that it was quite fiery. She shrugged and said that was how it came. My husband's dish was fiery too but it had said it had pepper so he expected that. As someone else has said, the music was bad and intrusive - and really unnecessary. Not hurrying back."}
{"text":"I took my niece and nephew here for their anniversary. We were seated promptly but then things went straight downhill. It was a 45 minute wait for our entrees to arrive.  Their two young boys were with us and understandably got a little fidgety and cranky. When the entrees finally did arrive, my steak, which was supposed to be cooked medium rare, was basically seared and raw and mostly gristle and fat.  Pretty unedible.  We were considering taking my nephew's mom here for her seventieth birthday but have taken this place off our list of prospects.  A very disappointing  experience."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Very nice.  The food is excellent.  It is a good mix of meditterannean and American influences.  The wine selection, of course, is commendable.  The patio in the summer is terribly romantic!  It's situated in an odd spot but I think that adds to it's appeal.  Make it a point to have a meal here!"}
{"text":"Andoras has been a favorite go to for us since they opened.....until last evening. We took our nephew to an off to college dinner and I ordered my usual....the used to be delicious grilled salmon. My husband ordered the same. First off the presentation was un inspiring, second my salmon was raw and third the fish looked like it had been butchered! The piece was thin and ragged. The rice side and chefs medley were under seasoned and well blah! My nephew ordered the filet which he thought tasty but again the piece of meat was badly cut. It looked like a flat hockey puck! The manager gave us a free appetizer for a future visit but I think that may not happen. Sometimes expanding the restaurants causes a problem with quality and it certainly has here. We ate outside on the patio which is the best part but they should think of putting cushions on the seats. The table came to mid chest which is awkward for eating.......so disappointing ."}
{"text":"Went to eat last night for our yearly Christmas dinner.   Scallops were terrific but the pork tenderloin was overcooked and dry and the entire entree was luke warm.  Service was awful and waited 15 minutes until we were able to put in a drink order. Its a great place but was  not tops last night."}
{"text":"Went there Friday night for dinner- service was slow and had the chicken and pasta w goat cheese entree. Pasta came sitting in 2 inches of broth and no goat cheese or pine nuts which was part of the description . Told the server and she took it back and remade it - it was poorly made and bland - no apology and it looked like they just threw the ingredients in what they took back when dish came back out - for $22 and no salad included I expect more than this crappy food sloppily made - and sever could have cared less -"}
{"text":"You know I have probably whipped around the corner that this place is located a million times and nothing really peaked my interest. I tried this place because a buddy and his wife asked us out for dinner and I was really blown away by what a tasty joint this is!  WE had reservations on a Saturday night which from the looks of the place it is probably recommended if you want to be seated in a timely manner as it was packed at 7pm. We started off with 2 appetizers the zucchini ribbons that had a pepper cream sauce on them and the shrimp spring rolls. The Zucchini was pretty tasty and I know that quality over quantity usually applies with me but for the price I think there is room to bump up the serving size of the zucchini a little bit maybe 2 extra zucchini pieces would suffice. The Shrimp spring rolls where not the fresh type but the deep fried version. Even though they were deep fried the wrapping was not overcooked and it was fairly light and crisp. I would have the spring rolls again over the zucchini.  The special Lady had the Crab Cakes which I swear to god are some of the best crab cakes I have ever had. So take that Maryland! Seriously though not much filler at all in these crab cakes and I would almost say that the large lumps of crab meat were almost on the side of too much meat and not a enough binding agent. But man they were tasty. I had a wedge that was also dynOmite with a really nice twist added to it with some corn on it.  Then I had the Potato Crusted Seared Tuna which I was like holy crap you all have to try this but psyche, I'm not letting any of you guys try this it is all for me. I liked the crispiness of the potato flakes on the outside of the fish but it was cooked perfectly medium rare for me. It was then topped off with some sort of chipotle sauce that really made this dish fantastic.  The bar area looks like it could also be a great place for a few drinks and apps, maybe I will try that next time. I also Thought that their wine list was expansive and had some great choices as well as a nice array of beers to choose from on tap.  The service was very good  as our server was very attentive and everything came out at the appropriate times and we did not feel rushed at all throughout our meal. I really recommend giving these place a shot with your next paycheck."}
{"text":"Extremely nice people, relaxed but fancy atmosphere nice little places tucked away! We lived in and had absolutely wonderful food!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful relaxing outdoor dining area.   Great service, good food."}
{"text":"Good food but eat inside as they haven't figured out that they need a few bug zappers! The gnats have taken over their outside eating area."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time on the weekend.  The atmosphere was great.  However, I felt the food was good and the presentation was very nice.  I had the filet Oscar and thought the filet was tender but the topping was too salty.  I felt that the meal was over priced."}
{"text":"Stopped here one night with a friend--found it to be way OVERPRICED!  Seafood Nachos had only specks of shrimp--$18.00. Grand Marnière on the rocks--$13.00 (whole bottle at store is only $39) Tito's Vodka on the rocks--$7.75 (whole bottle at store is only $18) Crfatworks Chardonnay--$9.00 glass (whole bottle at store $17)  It certainly was not for the ambiance--dimly lit bar and no music. Thought this was just a snobbish place with very high prices"}
{"text":"Andora plays to the middle market quite well. For those who don't want to get all dressed up and head to a fancy restaurant but also want to avoid the Eat'n'Park type places this is the place for you.   Having been a loyal customer for years it is clear to see why Andora has a cult following of loyal customers. The menus change seasonally, but aside from the nightly special there tends not to be too much variety. The food that they do have is prepared well 90% of the time. (There are nights when you can tell the chef is a little off but those are far and few between).   The ambience is \"dressy casual\", but you can literally see people in jeans and tshirts seated next to those in dressier attire. It is a nice family restaurant (provided your kids are at least somewhat behaved), but it is also a nice date place as well. If you call ahead they are excellent with larger parties.   In the winter they have the fire place going, in the summer the patio is gorgeous. It is a very good year-round place to eat, and I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We recently moved into the area and thought we would give Andora a try for a birthday dinner. The service was very quick (almost too quick) and the waitress was pleasant. We started with the calamari which was above average. Our entrees, however, were subpar, especially for the price. I had the chicken with crab and the whole dish had one note and was under seasoned (the chicken was cooked well though). My wife had the veal and the dish was overpowered by the tomatoes in the under seasoned sauce. We are not planning to return."}
{"text":"Walk in to sit at the bar and get something to eat.  The bartenders could care less.  They have their regulars and that all they care about.  Very rude, would not even look me in the eye.  I ask for my food to go, since they were so rude.  I received wilted carrots, raw,.  The pita bread was cold and stale.   Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We love this place!  They have a long time staff who get to know you with a friendly bar and good service.  Food is very good and consistent, and reasonably priced in my opinion.  Always serving fresh fish features that never disappoint. Can't beat the jumbo lump crab cakes.   Beautiful outdoor patio.  Always a go to place when we can't decide on anything else!"}
{"text":"Great service and food in an adorable old building that is over 100 years old in the heart of Fox Chapel.  Reliably good-- I love the salmon as well as the zucchini ribbons.  Definitely a local favorite.  Nice bar area with wooden paneling, cozy."}
{"text":"We had a. delightful experience. The food was. exceptional,.especially the shrimp spring. rolls. The staff was exceptionally. courteous to our family. They even found a \"parking space\" for my mother-in-law's walker before I could even. ask."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood so this place is close and I try to go there often. I love the outdoor patio. The food however leaves much to be desired. Last week the seared tuna appetizer was cold in the middle. It is obviously purchased pre-prepped and frozen. This week I tried the calamari. It tasted like it was also taken from the freezer and put into the deep fryer.  They came out luke warm in the middle. The Chile sauce was something straight out the bottle that they probably purchased atrRestaurant Depot or from Sysco Foods. The people next to me sent their scallops back to the kitchen because they too were cold. I really want to like this place but the consistently sub standard food makes it impossible. I like the physical space but I think may be limited to the salads."}
{"text":"Third visit to Andorra last Sunday and it was disappointing. The restaurant was not full but the waitress seemed over busy. Seated in a draft. No bread and when the entres arrived they were not hot. Crab cakes were excellent as was the Chicken Andora. Portions were generous. Just a shame they were tepid. May give them one more try."}
{"text":"New menu.  The new menu is tasteless and not up to the caliber of the old one. The new Tuna is a disaster. The sauce is sweet and boring. Also where did the scallops go?  We used to go there a couple times a week, now not so sure."}
{"text":"We hosted a baby shower here for my sister this past weekend.  From the initial outreach through us leaving the venue, the Andora staff was excellent.  Tiffany and Andrew (General Managers) did a great job helping us plan the shower and accommodating requests (accessibility for guests, dietary restrictions, custom menus, etc.).  There was an appropriate amount of communication beforehand to make sure things ran smoothly.  The day of, Tiffany was on site to greet us.   She and her staff offered to help carry things in, set things up, and tuck away some unsightly boxes that were used to transport decorations.  Her staff throughout was solid, especially Nathan.  He was courteous, quick, and professional.  We appreciated their flexibility and willingness to work with us.  Thank you, Andora!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch with high hopes as it had been recommended.  Arrived 12.45 pm. We waited for 7 minutes at the hostess stand and only saw one waiter who dutifully ignored us even though he went by several times.  While standing there we heard one customer say they had been waiting for their entree for over one hour!  No one at the bar, only one waiter. Lots of people there ( maybe half full) so we gave up and went to Hoffstats which is always good!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fabulous service, fresh fare and warm ambience.  The homemade shrimp rolls are to die for, the salad fresh and tossed with the perfect amount of dressing,"}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner with friends this evening.  The monkfish was delicious.  The ahi tuna appetizer was perfect and tasty.  The atmosphere was great and we sat and enjoyed each other without any interruptions.  The waitress who waited on us couldn't have been more attentive and helpful"}
{"text":"I'm surprised Andora doesn't have a solid 4 star rating considering the food is consistently delicious and presented in a timely manner.  I normally go for the seafood; any of their grilled or seared fish is worthwhile.  The tuna is personally my favorite, it's melt in your mouth kind of tuna.  Crabcakes come with baltimore style large chunks of crabmeat and is easily.  I have heard they have a pretty awesome back porch during fair weather months."}
{"text":"I was waiting for this restaurant to show up on YELP ! I have been here several times since it opened last summer. It is housed in the same building that used to be The Colony, Cafe Euro and then Jasmine restaurants. Hope they do better than the previous two although The Colony was open for approx 30 years ( My parents used to love that place ). I was told they are going to open a patio for outdoor seating next summer.  The food has always been good with many nightly specials but I feel the best thing is the wine. They feature many quality bottles for only $20 each !!!  The cheapest I have ever seen in a nicer restaurant. The bar area is a nice area to sit and have a drink or even grab a bite. This place is busy for lunch and dinner so be warned.. call ahead. If you like DeBlassio's or Atria's , you will love this place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the food was mediocre.  The staff was friendly and accommodating.  To start, I had the Zucchini ribbons.  They were probably the best part of my meal.  Next I had the shrimp bisque.  It was salty and average.  To be fair, I'm very picky when it comes to soup.  My salad was the wedge salad.  It had a nice mix of ingredients.  My gripe here is that it was very cold and tasted like it had been refrigerated for it bit.  My entree was the gruyere and sherry chicken with Mash. Potatoes and asparagus.  It was just ok.  I had higher hopes for Andora.  The people were nice and the environment was very nice!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey may need to help! Visited the Mt.Nebo Andora last night and I was very disappointed in the food. I had the veal dish, which ended up being very tough overcooked veal with a lousy gravy ( almost tasted like store-bought ), overly salted mashed red potatoes, and 4 pieces of undercooked Asparagus. My guest ordered a Chicken pasta dish - and it was pretty apparent from the taste and consistency that the chicken was from frozen inventory. It really had the taste of freezer burn. For the price that was charged for each dish, I expected much better quality."}
{"text":"Started w/ the crab cake appetizer since that is what they are apparently known for.  Comes with a red onion caper sauce and very little filler; which is a bonus when you actually get crab in a crab cake !  Great tasting too.  I had the seared scallops w/ a habanero infused olive oil.  Came with asparagus & a risotto that had a little bit of a kick to it.  Loved all of it.  Hubby had the steak & portabella mushroom ravioli.  While he did like it; it only came with 6 ravioli and that was not enough for him.  Topped it off with bread pudding that came with cinnamon ice cream on top and caramel sauce.  Superb!"}
{"text":"I was very glad we tried this place!  The stuffed banana pepper appetizer was out of this world! It had a good kick to it just how I like it!  We tried the crabcake salad and the ahi tuna salad for lunch. The crab cake salad  was a little smaller than I expected but very very tasty. It had a great mix of greens and the perfect amount of dressing. The crabcake was definitely different from what I've had before.  It wasn't crunchy but more so creamy. Delicious either way!   The ahi salad was quite a bit bigger. The tuna was cooked perfectly and very tasty! The salad had a horseradish dressing on it which was surprisingly good especially because I don't like horseradish!  We sat on the back deck. It was absolutely adorable!  There was a very nice back deck area as well as a rock garden area with tables!   This place would be a great spot for date night! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We went for a special occasion and had reservations.  My mom made the reservation and told them that I am handicapped.  They have two floors of seating and there is no elevator.  When we arrived for our 6pm reservation we were told that we would be seated upstairs.  When my mom told the hostess that  she reserved a downstairs table she was told that they overbooked and if we wanted to sit downstairs we would have to wait until 9pm.  By the time I made it up the stairs I was exhausted and ready to go home.  While our waiter was very nice, the kitchen was unable to accommodate my dietary needs.  We knew that I wouldn't be able to order off the main menu but the plan was that I would order a baked potato.  Apparently they do not serve baked potatoes but offered mashed potatoes.  When we asked why I could not get a baked one, the waiter whispered the the mashed potatoes were powdered.  In a restaurant of this caliber I would have expected the potatoes to actually be real potatoes.   My mom and grandmother ordered the salmon which was overcooked and rubbery.  The only highlight of the night was that my aunt ordered the ahi tuna and she said it was prepared excellently.  Needless to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"First time here. Close to Audobon facilities in Fox Chapel. Lunchtime. Shrimp Bisque is very good and hot. Chicken salad on croissant also very good. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We have been there many times before with experiences going from decent to good.  Our most recent visit was unfortunately horrible. Reservations at seven, seated at 7:15 and ordered appetizers and drinks shortly thereafter.  The appetizers showed up quickly and we're good, but one hour later the manager stopped by and asked what we were waiting for and we told her we are waiting to order dinner.  The waiter showed up soon after and apologized and took our order but it was almost another hour until dinner showed up.  And when it did they only brought three of four dinners.  The fourth dinner didn't arrive for another 15 or 20 minutes.  My Ahi tuna was flavorless and cold, the other dinners were Ok, but 3 of us were done eating before the 4th dinner showed up. The waitress then said that we'd get free desserts, but we were full and didn't want any - to which she replied that we had to have one or she wouldn't \"be able to sleep tonight\". So we ordered a dessert to share 4 ways.  When they delivered the dessert I asked for a coffee with Frangelico, which took too long again and when it showed up it was a cup of coffee with no cream or sugar and a snifter of Frangelico - not at all what I wanted (which was a coffee drink) and her answer was to bring me another coffee - to split the Frangelico between - and then charged me for both, despite the horrible service, offer for free dessert that we didn't want, and the lousy service.   We left there and went to another place - ran into another couple who coincidentally was at the table next to us - and we all agreed that it was the worst experience at Andora ever.  And they had a different waitress - so that at least wasn't the whole issue - beyond disappointing!  We were trying to take friends out for a nice dinner who have been having a hard time - and by the end of the night we could only laugh about how bad things had been.  Over 3 hours total for dinner, with LONG gaps in the middle..."}
{"text":"Lovely patio and setting which made for an enjoyable lunch.  Lunch menu offers something for everyone and everything is very fresh.  Highly recommend the zucchini appetizer.  I also enjoy the crab cake salad/any of their salads."}
{"text":"Andora was just ok for me which was disappointing given the price tag on our meal.  I made reservations for Father's Day this past weekend for 5pm and when we showed up, the place was nearly empty.  The interior is nice and classy and the patio is beautiful. Our server, Patrick, was really accommodating and nice and it made for a great experience.  I ordered the crab cake dish, my dad had the seafood pasta, my mom had Andora chicken and my brother had the special which was a surf and turf with filet topped with sauce and crab, a crab cake and sides.  We started with the rolled zucchini, shrimp bisque and fresh baked bread.    My brother ordered the filet medium rare. It came out completely well done - brown all the way through.  While he is not one to complain or send food back, we did end up mentioning it to the server and he was quick to remedy the situation and have a new steak brought out for him.  We were already there for an hour and 15 minutes at this point, and the new steak took another 20.  This time, the steak came out bloody and raw in the middle.  At a $56 price point (the price was not mentioned at the time of hearing the specials and we only saw it on our final bill), I would expect the chef be able to cook a proper piece of filet.  Everyone had finished their meals, so my brother just boxed his food up to take home and said he would heat it the rest of the way through later.  Other than that, my side of veggies was unseasoned and the rice pilaf was just fine.  My parents enjoyed their food and our apps were good.  I probably wouldn't order the bisque again.  Overall, I think there are better places to have a dinner, but I wouldn't be opposed to come back and have drinks and apps on their pretty patio. Plus, it is close to home for me."}
{"text":"Andora catered my wedding this past year. My experience was extremely poor.    Management: During the 10 month planning process, I dealt with 3 separate catering managers, either b/c the previous one had quit or was fired by Andora management because they were not competent enough to handle the job. Each time I got a new catering manager, I had to re-explain the vision for the wedding down to every last detail. As busy as I was during my wedding planning, this seemed like something that should have been captured by the company and passed to the new staff. The new catering managers were not even quick to contact me when taking over my account even though my wedding was within weeks.   Food: During our tastings, the food was excellent. I was nervous that the change of management would affect the plate decisions, but was assured that since it would be the same chef, our food would taste the same at our wedding. Unfortunately, we were let down. Most of the food was only luke warm, and the vegetarian meals were complained about, stating that they consisted of only zuccini on a plate.   Payment: Through all the confusion of changing management for our account, an original contract was never signed. After asking countless times (nervous about their fulling their commitments during our wedding), we finally were able to sign a contract stating specifically the itemized cost of the services Andora would provide. The night of the wedding, the newest catering manager handed my mother a bill as we were packing up. The total cost was $10,000 more than previously negotiated. Although the catering manager tried to have my mother give a credit card on the spot, my mother said she would review the contract and call with a credit card number the next day. The next day, my mom found out from Andora that the owner decided that her contract was not valid b/c it was not a standard contract they used in the company, (recall: his staff gave it to us). When questioned about the difference in cost, they blamed one of their incompetant ex-catering managers for mispricing many items and then told us they expected us to pay for their employee's mistakes. When we tried to compromise by splitting the difference, the owner threatened to involve his company lawyers. On top of that, they charged the credit card in the midst of our dispute, without our consent. In the end, they ended up giving a few percent off the difference and we covered the rest, eager to just put this behind us.   Summary: Andora has good food at the restaurant, and the 3rd catering manager did seem to want to please us, but due to their company policies, flakey management staff, unequal quality of catered food, and poor general customer service, I would not recommend this vendor for any bride who wants to be sure her wedding planning goes smoothly."}
{"text":"I visited this place almost on accident after my coworkers and I ventured out for lunch. There was traffic on 28 (surprise surprise) so our boss suggested Andora. A restaurant I haven't tried? Sign me up! The location is a bit different, as it appears to be in the middle of a neighborhood and if you aren't looking for it, you may just drive right past it. It looks like a house! They have a beautiful outdoor dining area that I am completely smitten with. It's quiet, cozy, and has a water feature and fire pit for the evenings!  Their lunch menu has a little bit of everything but I settled on the lobster roll. It was divine! I asked for a side of coleslaw instead of fries, but the coleslaw left a bit to be desired and didn't have much flavor. I picked a few fries off of my coworker's plate and good lord are they good! Definitely getting the fries next time!   Service was great and they even fulfilled my coworker's request for a beet salad, which isn't on their lunch menu but it IS on their dinner menu. I left here pleased with my meal and overall experience. Prices range from $6 (soups) to $15 for lunch items that range from salads to sandwiches and a few entree choices as well!"}
{"text":"I was impressed by the food and the service.  The crab cakes are certainly the specialty of the house and worth ordering.  I also had the Spice rubbed pork tenderloin over roasted corn and poblano cream, topped with green chili and roasted corn salsa, served with chef's vegetable medley.  It was a creatively prepared entree and very flavorful.   So with a very good wine list and excellent service, I don't see how you could miss with Andora.  We sat out on the patio, which was a treat.  We were dressed a little casual from our hike, so that was a nice option to sit outside."}
{"text":"Food was great!   I ordered the scallops and subbed out the risotto for broccolini, scallops were nicely seared, good portion size and nice flavors.  Being from the Maryland area, we opted not to get crabcakes, but the server told us they were excellent and one of the more popular items on the menu.  As an app for the table, we ordered a variety of small plates, but the calamari really stood out.  Calamari was crispy, nicely breaded, but not too much breading (many places are very guilty of this).  Great flavoring and not too salty.  I also ordered shrimp bisque as a starter - would not recommend, it was over salted to the point where I could not finish it and I usually love soup!  Service was excellent, especially accommodating the one child in our group.  Our server also made sure I always had a drink in my hand!  Be sure of where you plan on sitting too - we thought we originally reserved the outside dining area, but they could not accommodate us as a larger group and we sat inside instead.  Not a big deal, but I've heard the outside dining area is even better."}
{"text":"We like the ambiance and quiet of this charming old inn, but find the food less than memorable. We've eaten there four or five times, usually because other places are closed. Each time we remember how poor the food is. Undercooked bread, bland soup,  boring menu. Too bad.  Also it is quite expensive."}
{"text":"It's fairly consistent for sure. The food is good but not anything really special. The shrimp bisque was good. It has a nice consistency for me but I don't like it real think and creamy. I prefer it slightly thinner. I had a bacon, caramelized onions and gorganzola flat bread that was smothered in gorganzola (a little to much for me).  My bf had the salmon. It was pretty good. I have had their salmon salad for lunch before and really enjoyed that. It's worth a visit, because the food and atmosphere are good. Just don't have crazy high expectations.."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and the atmosphere has really changed.  My husband and I went on a Saturday evening and sat in the bar to order drinks and dinner since the restaurant area was busy. The appetizers were ok but the Andora chicken with risotto was undercooked and soggy.  The drinks were pretty good but it was very hard to get the attention of either bartender.  I was a bit surprised to see how inattentive 2 bartenders could be on a busy Saturday night.  One older bartender was catering to the rowdy drunk group that included a drunk grandma.  She also left a tray of glasses sitting right next to us the entire time. The younger bartender was going on and on about her baby to a different  group of (uninterested) guys. It was a very unpleasant visit that will definitely be our last."}
{"text":"The gnocchi was better than average, and cream sauce was good, but for nearly $20 it came with no sides and I had to pay an extra $6 for a side salad. Though the service was very good for the price I know I can get better. if you are going for wine they do have a good assortment at decent prices."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner last night and got the chance to sit outside. The food and service were very good and the shade garden is quite enjoyable at this time of year. Overall, another excellent experience."}
{"text":"Superior food quality, service, and atmosphere. You receive five-star food and service without feeling uncomfortable like you might at a very fancy restaurant.   I ordered their cheeseburger (my parents both got their chicken salad croissants). We also got shrimp bisque. Holy cow - delicious! Also, the burger was literally the best burger I've ever eaten. This place has food hand crafted by the gods, at a reasonable price, served by extremely kind people, in a relaxing and warm environment. Must visit!"}
{"text":"Best Mother's Day dinner ever. Dinner included appetizer, soup or salad, entree, and desert. We arrived10 minutes early but were seated immediately. My wife and daughter enjoyed the menu choices and the service was very good. We normally enjoy this restaurant but tonight we had an exceptionally good time."}
{"text":"Andora used to be lovely 12 years ago, but now is a disappointment. The food is mediocre and the service at a bare minimum. I've retried twice in the last three years, hoping I just hit a bad day, but Andora seemed to prepare and serve my food grudgingly, as if I was an imposition."}
{"text":"A local pittsburgher would love this place. It smells like a cafeteria, not a fine dining establishment . The crowd says it all.  First off the benches outside were faded and ruins the atmosphere. Store bought bread was served with oil, yuk. We asked for butter. It came in ice cold packets. Not classy.  The zucchini rolls were not appealing and they were poorly pan fried with greasy blobs of cheese inside .   Crab cakes, flavorless, colorless and with mushy breading. Veggies on the side were pretty but tasteless. .  Soup was bland, ok but wasn't from scratch, it tasted like Sysco prepared all of the sauces here.  The French fries were crispy but had a weird coating on them. Almost a sweet taste, most likely from Sysco also.  This would seem upscale to a blue collar crowd.  They try but it's not enough.  Place is clean.  Oh, the bathroom  was freezing. This was very uncomfortable"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to begin my review. Andora is one of my favorite places I love to visit while in Pittsburgh. The service is impeccable, waitstaff and bartenders are extremely friendly. The food is always on point. You can never go wrong with any of the appetizers, especially the ahi tuna, zucchini, or crab cakes. The bar is an extremely relaxing atmosphere to enjoy some cocktails and an appetizer at the end of a tough day. If you are there in the summer, make sure to check out the patio, I see why it's been voted one of the best outdoor dining spots in Pittsburgh. It's a never miss for me and my friends."}
{"text":"Cute local gem in Fox Chapel area. Ambience is cozy and distinctive, and as far as mid-upscale dining, better food than anywhere else in the area. The pork ribeye is ridonculous good.   The service isn't as \"sophisticated\" as say Donatos, but the people are genuine and authentic (translation - not douchey).   Tips - Bring your own wine and pay the corkage, and plan on 2 hours for dinner."}
{"text":"Andora...I just can't say enough good things about your food.  I'm not sure I've ever disliked something I've ordered.  The food is always cooked perfectly and seasoned appropriately.  They have a pretty big bar and a great outdoor patio.  They'll even provide lap blankets for a cooler evening (plus there are heat lamps).  Order anything from the menu, you won't be disappointed.  I love the crab cakes, the salmon (although I think they changed  menu recently and there is a different sauce on it from the last time so I can't make any guarantees on that) and the seared scallops in a soy sesame glaze.  The risotto that came with the scallops was creamy and cooked perfectly.  Also, the zucchini ribbon appetizers stuffed with cheese in a roasted red pepper sauce...I could eat them for a meal.  All of the salads are tasty too although I'd recommend splitting one if you're ordering appetizers and dinner.    The downside of Andora's is that it's a little pricey and it's tough to escape from there with under a $30 per person tab for just dinner (no drinks, salads, appetizers or dessert).  You're paying for the quality of the food so it's worth it but it's not a once a week dining experience.  The other downside is I think the indoor dining area is a little dated.  It's not terrible but it's a little stuffy and old-fashioned.  Also, they don't take reservations except for larger parties so you're in for a long wait during peak weekend dining hours."}
{"text":"Bridget was a great waitress!!!  Very accommodating !   Food was tasty"}
{"text":"Place is beautifully decorated and love the layout so i expected food to be wonderful too but it was all very bland.  We started with appetizer a habanero enfused risotto with scallops & expected some spicy heat but nothing not even a tingle. Our meal the same my friends poured on so much salt & still nothing. We didn't have dessert because already disappointed with dinner why bother.  Should we guess the rest of our stay this week will be bland food?  The service though was great the waitress felt bad we told her not her fault its cooks or that's just the way they cook out here. :/"}
{"text":"I was excited when I found Andora because I am always looking forward to trying out new restaurants. The menu and prices seemed reasonable. We went to Andora about a year ago in December. The place is decorated like we should be in the early 90s eating a formal dinner with family. The menu and food was good but my complaint was the service. Yes, I will admit that my spouse and I look young but we dine out more than most people and are well traveled. I found the server and staff to be stuffy and did not feel like an appreciated customer. I will not go back for that reason alone.   I would like to give them one star but feel that wouldn't be fair since the food was decent."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need to indulge!!!  This is my favorite spot to eat, if only I could afford to eat here everyday!!!  The food is absolutely delicious.  I always order the shrimp bisque, which has never been anything but spectacular!!!  They are known for their crab cakes as well.  If you ask they can offer you a smaller filet with a crab cake, which is my favorite meal to get!  The filet is always prepared to perfection!  They have outside seating in the summer.  I would suggest making sure you get a table with an umbrella.  I sat at a table with no umbrella once and received some unexpected surprises from above in my water.  The patio is gorgeous for any type of event or dinner.  This place doesn't offer your run of the meal dinner.  They provide you with great service that is friendly and properly timed out.  I prefer to have an eating marathon not a sprint!  They provide this type of service.  As many times as I have been here I Have never complained about the food at all.  I will say that it seems as though the pasta dishes don't seem to be as appealing as the other dishes.  Love this place and would suggest to anyone looking for a great night out to try it out."}
{"text":"The seared scallops , and jumbo lump crab cakes are fantastic. The service , and atmosphere are wonderful. We will definitely return!!! Thanks"}
{"text":"I have lived in the Sewickley area and have always gone to Andora a couple times a year and always enjoyed the food even though it needs remodeled desperately. We had a reservation for 10 for outside the service was exceptionally slow and the food has been substituted with a cheaper version. It took about an hr from appetizer to salad and salad to entree. The ahi tuna was dry and not fresh, the steak was one of the worse cuts of filet. We live close to the restaurant and the place looks empty every night now we know why. Will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a wonderful meal. We shared the Zucchini Ribbons and we both absolutely loved it and decided this appetizer dish will be ordered each time we dine here.  I ordered the crab cakes and my friend ordered the scallops.  Both entrees were well prepared and very satisfying.  The house wine complimented my meal nicely.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"SKIP IT!!  Lousy and extremely overpriced, our meal was over $200 for four of us. Steak was cold, crab cakes were a disappointment, service was laughably poor, we even had to send a bottle of wine back.  Skip this place, it's not what cross keys used to be. Only saving grace is that the bar is really cozy, and they've created a nice space out back to eat outside. But don't expect them to light the heaters. Also the music they played was extremely bad (backstreet boys? Really?)  Also the bathroom was disgusting, I won't mention what someone must have done in there ahead of me but it was unusable, just foul."}
{"text":"The food was spectacular. The service was excellent. I recommend this stuff zucchini appetizer and beet salad. Ask for Adam!"}
{"text":"The food was ok at this place. I had the special of the day \" fish meal\" and it was tasty with the side sauce. If it weren't for the sauce the meal would have been blan. The service was ok and there is ample parking."}
{"text":"We have been here once before and enjoyed it but since then I've needed to go gluten-free, not too many options if your gluten free. I got one of the specials that was $47, Oscar style Delmonico steak with mashed potatoes, the steak had no flavor. My husband got the ribeye with Gorgonzola and raved about it. He said it tasted amazing. Our waiter was interesting, not very personable and it seemed like we were holding him up when we were ordering. He also forgot to bring us any bread, it had been in the oven but when it was done he didn't bring it to us we had to ask again.  We sat outside which was so beautiful!!!"}
{"text":"Tuesday half off wine bottles is perfect for the summertime to sit outdoors! Good meals- recommendation on the Cona coffee dry rub rib eye pork loin, the salmon, and stuffed peppers for an app."}
{"text":"Friday night.  Place is packed.  We didn't have to wait too long for a table.  Pretty good start to the evening.  It was a bit chilly but we sat on the patio under the heat lamps.  The service receives top marks.  We never had to wait or want for anything.  I started with the cheddar ale soup.  This had a nice blend of flavors and neither was overpowering.  They also get you going with a nice bread/oil thing which is always nice.  For dinner, I tried the surf and turf.  This was a crab cake and a fillet.  The crab cake was delicious.  'nough said.  The fillet was perfectly prepared.  The bar area was hard to get service.  They were busy, but really didn't pay attention to who was next (-1)."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. It's in a convenient location for us and it's upscale, but comfortable. The decor is traditional, classy, and it's a generally quiet restaurant. You can go dressed up and it would be nice for a date, but it's also good for a delicious family meal. The bar/lounge looks really cool, but I've not seen it busy. My mom lives very close to Andora so we tend to visit on off-nights, I think.  The crab cakes were mentioned to be a house specialty, so I tried their surf and turf (crab cake and filet mignon) on my most recent visit. I had the filet rare, and it was cooked perfectly. The crab cake is very meaty with just enough filling to hold it together.   The menu changes with seasons (they were offering a pumpkin filled pasta dish recently) and everything is fresh and presented nicely. If you want a salad, this is more of a $$$ Yelp dinner, but well worth it!  They have a lot of interesting wines that you don't see on every menu and there are options priced for everyone. The waitress was cool and let us try some things before ordering a glass. The glass pours are generous. Her recommendations were spot on.  Andora is located in the old Colony Restaurant location that has changed several times since the long-standing Colony closed. I hope Andora stays because the staff is friendly. There is complimentary valet parking, so don't be afraid about their narrow parking lot.  My mom also said they get a big lunch crowd, but I've not seen that. I would be interested to try it for lunch sometime!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorites and I'm lucky enough to live less than 5 minutes away! The Kona-crusted pork chop is awesome. They have flatbread specials daily and appetizer specials during happy hour. I always sit at the bar and have attentive and personable service. It's a great bar atmosphere if you're looking for a splurge."}
{"text":"I went to Andora recently and really enjoyed the food.  I got the grilled salmon and it was perfectly cooked, not too dry or raw - flaky just how it was meant to be.  The flavor was very light so if you like a heavy hand of seasoning, maybe choose another entree.  The portion was just right and the service was good.    The decor is all fancy inside, but well done.  I forgot I was in Green Tree...or I guess Mt. Lebo.  I had never heard of this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the positive experience."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in the food and service here. We had gone to the one in fox chapel and it was amazingly, so it made the lack luster experience here that much more surprising."}
{"text":"Not insanely crazy about this place although I hear certain people swear by this place.   The bartenders weren't nice. They weren't mean, but I noticed their interaction with other people and mine just wasn't the same.    We sat at the bar because we were on a time crunch and figured we'd get our food and drink quickly.  Let's just say by the time the bartender got to us we had to order food immediately and they never came back to me for a drink order (their loss).  It made me kind of sad.  One of my girlfriends had a bridal shower here and the staff and food was great, I was kind of disappointed with the service we recently received. Will I come back? Sure, but with the other food options with better service it'll probably take me 6 months or so.  There aren't many food options in that area, but I'm willing to take a drive for better service and some tasty beverages."}
{"text":"I ate here this past weekend for an early dinner with my girlfriend and her parents.  Since I was meeting them there and they arrived before me,  I did not actually see much of the restaurant other than the room that we were located in which had a small number of white tablecloth covered tables.   Our group decided to start off our evening with both the Southwest jalapeno corn cakes which were covered in a drizzle of poblano cream and raspberry chipotle sauce and also the crispy calamari which came with a side of chile sauce.  The calamari was good as it was crispy, yet not tough to chew and tasted great when covered with some of the chile sauce.  The corn cakes were also good with the raspberry topping adding some needed sweetness although it was difficult to taste much of the jalepeno.  For my entree I decided on the horseradish crusted Alaskan cod that came with a lemon butter sauce, mashed potatoes and asparagus.  My cod was cooked perfectly and came out warm but was very disappointing in taste.  It seemed like the horseradish crust on mine was missing and since cod is such a mild fish, it was almost like eating something flavorless and wet.  This was only only helped by the fact that my lemon butter sauce seemed to be MIA.  The only saving grace of my dish was that the asparagus was cooked nicely and the mashed potatoes were extremely creamy.  I was also able to try the sesame crusted tuna which my girlfriend had ordered and was covered in a soy sauce glaze with wasabi aoili.  It was actually very good with the sauces on it providing some depth which stood in stark contrast to my meal.  For dessert my girlfriend and I decided to split a creme brulee which came topped with some strawberries.  The custard of it was a bit watery but that did not seem to affect the good flavor of it and you could actually see the vanilla bean in the custard.   The bottom line for me is that based on my meal, I would probably not head back here in the future on my own accord.  However, my girlfriends dish was pretty good and I have heard from a friend that his horseradish encrusted cod was very good the night before and so maybe I just got a bad one."}
{"text":"This is a great meeting place for me and my friends- somewhere inbetween the north hills and south hills. The food is always outstanding- however the service isn't. They seem to be somewhat annoyed and irritated. But over all a nice little spot."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a dear friend.  Lunch was very lovely, food was good.  Good portions, resonable price.  Wait staff was wonderful.  The place was beautiful.  I would recommend for lunch and small gatherings.  They have some party spaces for an intimate gathering.  I would love to have one in the room off of the foyer on the right with the wood burning fire places.  So quaint!"}
{"text":"We've been to Andora's many times and make it a special place for my birthday each year. While the food and service has always been outstanding all of that changed for the worse tonight. Anytime we see restaurant discounts offered on Living Social, Groupon, etc we take advantage of the opportunity to save a couple bucks on our next visit.  Tonight we were fed a story about how the PA LCB just so happened to be in the restaurant this very same day and informed the staff that they are not allowed to discount liquor sales.  The issue that I have is that we purchased the discount coupons under certain rules and regulations at time of purchase. These are factors in the decision making as we often pass by on offers that do not include beer and wine sales. The Andora's offer had no such stipulations.  The staff were offensive and embarrassed us.  We will not return to Andora's and recommend the same to you.  Now excuse me while I make a sandwich."}
{"text":"Made reservations, which worked out great.  When we got here we sat at the bar got a drink a and an app, the ahi tuna very good, portion was a little small.  Sat outside for dinner, highly recommend that when able, outside area is great. Got the surf and turf, filet and crab cake and pasta with seafood that also had peppers and sausage in it. Dinner was great, we left happy and stuffed!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here with my parents on this beautiful Sunday evening around 5:30pm. We had reservations for the patio, which were absolutely not needed since we were the only table sitting outside. Once my boyfriend and mom kept being eaten alive by flies- or some other insect- we understood why no one else was seated on the patio. First off- the atmosphere....the beautiful gardens in the back with the fountain surrounded by flowers is just gorgeous! Such a serene and peaceful area. We were all quickly brought glasses of water and greeted by Kristy, who provided friendly and efficient service throughout our dining experience. We began with a bottle of Malbec- an excellent bargain at $30! We were brought bread and seasoned oil- which was delicious- while we perused the menu. Since I had heard they are well known for the crab cakes I went with that entree, which came with rice pilaf and mixed veggies, however I substituted asparagus instead. The good: the crab cakes were mostly meat with hardly any filler and were quite large. Also the onion caper sauce provided a sweet and tart compliment to the meaty cakes. The bad: the sides- the rice was flavorless and the asparagus flavorless and well undercooked. My dad and boyfriend both had the salmon, served with a teriyaki glaze, rice pilaf and asparagus. The consensus was the same on the rice and asparagus: flavorless, very bland. My dad enjoyed his salmon while my boyfriend also did, with the slight complaint it was undercooked. I did see part of his salmon and must agree with him- more on the medium rare than medium side. My mom ordered the walleye with a citrus sauce and same accompaniments. She enjoyed her walleye and was in agreement with the rest of us on the sides. We ordered dessert- two orders of the warm brownie with vanilla ice cream, caramel, chocolate, and nuts. This was the highlight of the meal for all of us but it's very hard for a dessert like that to not be absolutely yummy! Overall, I enjoyed the main part of my meal- the crab cakes- so I'd be eager to return and try some of the other dishes that received rave reviews!"}
{"text":"My family had dinner last Thursday night at Andora.  We have liked the ambiance and location of this local historic restaurant in visits under previous ownership.  We were disappointed with the food.  My surf and turf was bland all around and the meat was rare not medium-pink as requested, my son's sauteed chicken breast with sherry gruyere sauce should have been much more flavorful and all of the food could have been presented better.  My husband wasn't particularly impressed with his filet mignon and my daughter didn't comment about her pork tenderloin but took most of her dinner home.  The appetizers, however, were delicious (flatbread, calamari--nice and light and not overdone, zuccini ribbons) and we all agreed that the best way to experience this restaurant is probably with drinks and appetizers in the cozy social room near the bar with a fireplace.  The quality of the entrees did not live up to the price.  The service was adequate.  Our server was willing to take my steak back but I preferred to bring the rare portion home to heat up as leftovers.  Also, the hot tea served was an inexpensive bland brand rather than the Tazo or comparable better quality teas served at most restaurants of this level."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in because one of our diners had a gift card...  So we headed north on 79 after an evening at the Point (to see the giant duck).  The lot was full, and we almost headed back toward Ohio River Ave, but got out to check.  Nice place, but located between a gas station and housing complex.    When I entered, I was weary to see the table-tops -- immaculate with fine settings - but I was in khaki shorts.  As I turned to leave, the incoming group had small children, and looked as if they were dressed for a little-league game.  Mesh shorts and all.  So we stayed.  Glad we did.    \"Casual Fine Dining\" is an understatement.  Professional staff and fine food served among casually hip (or not-so-hip) soccer moms on the way home from practice.  Decent wine list, and small menu.  The calimari was some of the best around, get it! Great with the (bottled) sweet-chili sauce.  The stuffed zucchini ribbons were tasty, if soggy.  The veal marsala had a great sauce, and the stuffed double pork chop was cooked perfectly, bones frenched, and lightly stuffed with a mix of green apples, sausage, banana peppers and sage.  Amazing.  Unfortunately, the mashed reds were cold and congealed.  The pasta dishes were bland and boring.  Olive Garden serves better.  Choose wisely, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Lovely building and interior, and very pleasant service--but the food at our recent dinner did not meet expectations. We ordered the pork tenderloin and Alaskan cod. My mother's pork was dry and tough, while her green beans were essentially raw (some with stems). My fish and asparagus were lovely, but the lemon sauce was tepid and starting to congeal. The smashed potatoes were cold and dry. I was very disappointed, as I had hoped to treat Mom to a really special meal. Instead, she had to gnaw her way through overcooked and undercooked food. I had previously had lunch here and had an excellent salad, so I may try again. But Mom won't go back."}
{"text":"Food was amazing,  the waiter suggested a great bottle of wine for a compromise between red and white.   We ordered from the standard menu,  everything was amazing.   This is now my new special occasion place.   Thank you for great service  and outstanding food.   I can't wait to get back to Andora."}
{"text":"We had dinner here the other night and the food was fantastic. I had the pasta with shrimp, scallops, and sausage. One of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. Only wish there were more shrimp and less scallops. My wife had the scallops and they were very good also. Only negative or not great part was the noise level and space in the dining room. Wasn't much room for the waiters to maneuver between tables so someone was always standing like right behind me.. It was also very loud and I couldn't hear conversations at our table. All in all though great food and will be back soon hopefully to sit outside"}
{"text":"I agree with Julie D. The Surf and Turf was excellent. One of the best steaks I've had. I'm not even a crab cake person, but I have to agree that it is the best I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews, but this place deserved one! I was home visiting from Philadelphia and was sick of eating at the same places in my hometown. So, I found this place and I'm glad I did! From the staff to the food it was amazing!! I brought my grandmother here for dinner and we had the crab cake appetizer, she had the chicken with crabmeat and I had the goat cheese ravioli. I only eat seafood but she said her chicken was done perfect and finished almost all her meal. My ravioli were amazing, I was very curious about how the goat cheese would be and it was great. Very flavorful, I ate the whole plate it was the perfect portion! Kudos Andora this place will be on my top list! I already told all my friends who live locally to go here for their next night out!! Next time I'm home ill definitely be in! Next time I hope to try and leave room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I have eaten there a few times now and usually like what I get. My fiancee loves the place. The best shrimp bisque I've ever had! The pasta dishes are small, but my most recent meal was the surf and turf special. It was good and very reasonably priced. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly. Seafood pasta is very good - scallops very tender. Pumpkin tortellinis were also good. Needed to go to a performance in Pittsburgh and they were very good about getting the food out in a timely manner. Highly recommend this local favorite!"}
{"text":"When you stop in because there are only 5 cars in the parking lot and the patio has one table seated and the young girls working as hostesses  tell you that they have a lot of reservations and they won't seat you. Then you turn around as you are walking out and they are rolling their eyes and laughing at you.  Yep. Not going back there until they can hire people who know how to behave in a customer facing job. You blew it, girls.   This place is NOT worth that level of attitude."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to take your significant other and want to impress them then andoras is the place to go. My wife and I came here on a recommendation from a friend and we were completely blown away. The atmosphere is warm and cozy as it appears that this restaurant used to be a former dwelling years ago. The noise level can be a little loud but if anything it adds to the atmosphere.  The wait staff at andoras is very knowledgeable and courteous.  When ordering wine they give you the option to sample it to ensure that it is what you're looking for. This may be common practice at higher end restaurants, but for the location of this venue it is a pleasant surprise that this is offered.  The food is second to none. Having gone here in the dead of winter you can sometimes worry about the freshness of the food, but this was not the case at Andoras. The vegetable medleys that are served with many of the dinners were very fresh and delicious. The salad selections were both pleasantly fresh and creatively made.  For the main entree enough can't be said on how fresh literally everything is. My wife had scallops and I had the filet mignon. Very rarely do I order a steak at a restaurant for fear of it being frozen prior to it being cooked. The meat was lightly seasoned and was topped with herb butter as it was brought out to be served. The steak wasn't overly coated in seasonings and sauces which was great because it allowed the flavor of the meat to truly come out.  Overall I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. If you want to impress someone take them here."}
{"text":"Crabcakes don't get any better - pure lump meat, zero filler.  The patio in the summer is my favorite.  Also - 30 under $30 for the wines can't be beat."}
{"text":"We went for a girls night, and although the atmosphere in the dining room was a little stuffy (we should've went to the bar area), the food was great! I had the lobster and crab pappardelle and it was worth the slightly high price tag with tons of lobster and homemade pasta. My friends got the chicken penne, mozzarella linguine, and shrimp bisque and all enjoyed their entrees as well. I would return."}
{"text":"Excellent entrees, salads, and appetizers, terrific service, pleasant atmosphere, and accommodating people. Love it. One of our favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Lovely outside seating. Nice bar area. Lunch is reasonably priced. Staff is attentive and professional. Their crab cake was pretty good. Nice wine selection. Nice and place for a party."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick drink.  Met a friend for a quick drink.  Place is nice and relatively large.   Had the jumbo lump crab cake appetizer with a red onion caper sauce that was very good."}
{"text":"Andora is a great spot for outdoor dining, as the food is great and the atmosphere is delightful.  I really enjoy the outdoor dining area, so if it's nice, give it a shot.  Andora can get very, very busy on Friday and Saturday nights, and usually has a large crowd during the week as well.    The bar is good too, and if you're only going for drinks know that the crowd is my parent's age, not mine.  The crab cakes here are some of the best in the city, and I find it hard to pass them up when I go."}
{"text":"We were visiting the Pittsburgh area and drove by this restaurant, saw the back patio and turned around.  The parking lot was full that night so we figured that there must be a reason for that.  We sat at the bar until a table on the patio opened up.  I had a glass of their sangria.  It was one of the best sangria's I have had (other than my own).    Our server, Rebecca, was lovely and attentive.  She brought out fresh hot bread with their house dipping oil.  It was delicious and she cheerfully offered to bring us more when we finished it.  The rest of our food came out quickly.  We ordered the zucchini ribbons which is a house specialty (we can get calamari anywhere).  They were very tasty and we really enjoyed them.  My bf had the rib-eye which had a nice sear to it and was cooked perfectly to his liking.  It was one of the best steaks we have had in a very long time.  I had a craving for pasta. The spicy seafood pasta (which was just a little spicy) did the trick.  We were too full for dessert.    The restaurant has a homey comfortable feeling inside, if a little dated, but it is the huge back patio that is the standout.  It's the perfect place to be on a warm summer night.  I am sucker for those little string lights which were all over the patio.  The landscape was also lovely and we felt like we were dining in a secret garden.  We loved it and when we are back in the area again, we will surely return."}
{"text":"I've frequented Andora at least 5 times. The food and drink are always on-point. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't really impressed with this restaurant. My salmon was a small portion and was really char grilled tasting. Came here for Father's Day with a group of family members. Although the brownie and ice cream was good"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path, on Mt. Nebo road, you will find Andora's.  A friend at work told me about this place and I had to try it.  She said it's one of her favorite restaurants.  \"Best crab cakes in Pittsburgh,\" she said.  We'll just have to see about that, I thought.  Don't be fooled by the exterior, inside the dining room, while formal, it's warm and cozy.  Windows are covered with formal flowered valances and blinds, tables are covered with white linens and cream colored napkins, complete with fresh flowers.  We were seated near a fireplace.  The tables are all a different angles, so it still feels intimate.  Wood wainscoting covered the walls and also the angled ceiling in our dining area.  They have a nice wine list, but we opted for our favorites drinks.  Bread was crusty and fresh from the oven and served with perfectly seasoned oil dipping sauce that included sun dried tomatoes.  Me and my friend Robert decided to share a Cesar salad.  The salad was very good.  Served with a fried crisp of asiago cheese and a hard slice of toasted bread for the crouton, the salad included marinated tomatoes.  Delicious!  Since I heard so much about the crab cakes, I opted for the Turf and Surf, which was an 8 oz. filet mignon served with a crab cake.  Both were delicious, the crab cake had no filler and was served with red onion caper sauce.  The steak was very thick and perfectly cooked.  Sides were green beans/baby carrots and mashed potatoes served with bacon and cheese.  The potatoes, while very yummy, were not much to look at.   The veggies were very yummy.  Robert had the salmon teriyaki.  He's very nice, he shares, it was very good!  Perfectly cooked.  For dessert, we shared a huge thick slice of cheese cake drizzled with a raspberry puree.  It was very creamy and smooth and served with a dollop of fresh whipped cream.  Service was warm and friendly.  Not crowded, but busy, we went on a weekday night.  Very nice meal.  Other items on the menu included scallops, pasta dishes, pork.  Looking forward to summer, the patio looks very nice.  Don't forget, they serve lunch.  Parties of 6 or more require reservations."}
{"text":"I took my husband to Andora for a belated birthday lunch today. They don't open till 11:30 am but I called around 11:15 am and Susie took my reservation. Shelley greeted us at the desk and was very personable and checked in with us a couple of times during our lunch. We had a wonderful server whose name is Kara, we have had her almost every time we have gone to Andora, what a sweetheart and a blessing and she is excellent! The food was amazing and delicious! Thank you Andora, Shelley and Kara! Merry Christmas! Shelley seated us in the corner by the fireplace."}
{"text":"Had been here twice for work related events.  First time for lunch was good, but dinner this past week was good but not outstanding.  I had the Parpadelle Bolognese which was not that great.  The sauce was good, but the pasta noodles clumped together.  The cheesecake was delicious and huge.  I think the ambience and service is great, but a bit disappointed with the pasta for an Italian place.  I had the sole for lunch last time and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Very pleasant restaurant in Fox Chapel near Beechwood Farms. The food is of high quality and reasonably priced.  I would recommend their outside garden for its ambiance.  They do have a Half Price Tuesday wine offering. The wines are of average quality with high prices. Many times waitresses forget to apply the discount."}
{"text":"The food is so so and I was over charged thousands for the food at my Christmas party but the waitress slash bartender Debbie needs to go.   My girlfriend and me were at the bar after dinner talking about the economy and how I've been able to hire an employee and how my girlfriends retirement gained thousands in a week thanks to the economy under President Trump and Deb who was listening verbally lashed out out at us in front of all the bar patrons and called me an idiot etc etc. The conversation got pretty heated. She needs to be unemployed #1 because she should keep her mouth shut and #2 because she has no respect. She likes her free healthcare that us republican business owners provide. She should have been fired on the spot and had I not been paying with gift certificates the bill should have been credited.   I will be calling the management in the morning. If she's working go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place but I'm afraid there was a chef change or something and it is headed down hill.  The service was great- absolutely top notch.  HOwever, I got a pasta dish and had tons and tons of oil and wasn't very flavorful.  My dining companion got the steak which was overdone and tough.  I'm hoping they can turn this around!"}
{"text":"1). Ambiance:  4.5 stars. Located in a historic house, this restaurant is simultaneously 'cozy' and bright and elegant.  Definitely a place I would feel comfortable having a formal dinner in as well as drinks after work.  The outdoor patio isn't open yet (still too cold), but it looks great and I would definitely want to come.  2). Service:  4 stars. We sat at the bar.  The bartender was very attentive and personable.  The hostess was accommodating when we came in.  No complaints.    3). Food:  2.5 stars.  When everyone in the room -- including strangers-- laughs and comments on the appearance of your food when it comes out, there is a problem.  I had the fried eggplant.  It was ridiculously huge and ultimately not attractive .  It was piled on top of a giant pile of pasta that was overcooked.  Didn't taste good.  Not a winner.  Much of the food was kind of over large and not presented well.  Overall, a good place for drinks and outdoor seating.  Will try the food again in the hopes they work it out."}
{"text":"The food was good enough. The server was nice and helpful. The host who sat us pretty clearly didn't want us there. I'm guessing it was because my children, ages 2 and 3, were with me but I can't be sure. They have a kids menu and kids cups so probably they're ok with having kids there, but he was not at all welcoming. He barely looked at us, waved us to a table by the door, didn't give us menus, and made it pretty difficult for us to get his attention to tell him that there was someone else's glass of water and sugar packet sitting there. He moved us to another table- right beside the door to the kitchen- so basically the 2 worst tables in the building. Eventually our server brought us menus. She was surprised we didn't have them already. My sautéed chicken was average, but I have high standards for chicken so that could be me. My kid's chicken tenders were removed from the oven moments before being technically burnt. They were really dark brown. The food took a long long time. My kids are actually pretty well behaved but I was starting to feel like the food was taking so long I should no longer be held responsible if they lost their minds. They didn't quite lose their minds but the food taking so long really was a problem. So, overall... The food was ok, that host was taking excellent care of other guests so he's not all bad. Just don't go there with your small children."}
{"text":"Always excellent food. Love this restaurant. Cozy fire in the winter. Beautiful patio under umbrellas in the summer."}
{"text":"This restaurant is close to home and is always consistent . The food and service is always great and when the weather is good , the outside dining area can't be beat"}
{"text":"Nice Catfish special dinner, and I am not a fan of catfish. Good salad. Cappuccino was good; Desert seemed from a box, but good. It a long ride from the PIT airport hotel, but there is nothing else around (I could find). Glass top on table to keep the table cloth clean. No smoking"}
{"text":"I took my daughters here recently for a special night out. It started off kind of rough, as we sat for 25 minutes with just water in front of us. I finally got up and asked the maître d' for someone to wait on us.  After that everyone was very attentive to our table and apologized profusely.  I had called in advance for a reservation, but they said they had a lot of walkins which I felt should take a backseat to folks with reservations. I have to say the food was excellent. I had the salmon which was done exactly how I wanted it.  My daughters also enjoyed their meals.  They even offered us free dessert due to our long wait time but then added it to the bill anyway. I didn't feel like hashing things out so I just paid the entire bill.  I probably won't be in a hurry to go back."}
{"text":"We had fun here the other night.  Annie and I sort of last minute met up with Dave and Megan here on Tuesday night for happy hour.  I was trying to think of somewhere convenient to Cranberry (Dave and Megan's home) and the city where we spend our time.  I've been to Andora a few times...the last time for dinner and always thought it perfectly acceptable, but not quite fine dining.  The bar scene is much more fun.  The restaurant interior itself is quite intimate.  There are white tablecloths flattering lighting and the tables are close, but still provide enough privacy.  They also have a back deck that I'm told is a lot of fun, but obviously we couldn't try it on Tuesday due to the \"snowmageddon\" we are currently experiencing.  The bar is a bit of a contrast from the warm and subdued small dining room.  It's a relatively big bar for the size of the restaurant with a couple of TV's, some hi-tops and relatively full given the weather.  The folks seem to be mostly local ranging from 30's to 70's.  The bartender was a lot of fun (Jimmy) who certainly is a professional.  It's clear this is what he does for a living and seems to have a lot of fun.  He did this trick a couple times where he lit part of the bar on fire and then using his finger picked up the flame and blew alcohol over the flame creating a huge flash of blue for the whole bar to see.  He also made a relatively stiff whiskey coke on a cold day.  Dave and Megan were there when we arrived and we were all seated at the bar.  The drink orders were taken quickly.  Annie and Megan had a glass of wine and Dave and I had a couple of beers.  The wine Annie ordered seemed okay for a house wine.  My Guinness was poured properly.  We settled on a few apps'.  Annie and Megan had the wedding soup, which was a pretty large portion of homemade soup.  It was pretty good, however somewhat under seasoned.  Annie also ordered the flatbread of the day.  It is supposed to serve two, but quite frankly it was much smaller than a personal pan pizza.  This was okay, again not that memorable.  The crust wasn't crisp as it should be for thin crust pizza and the cheese could have been cooked a bit longer.  Dave ordered the ahi tuna tataki, which was probably the best thing we tried.  The tuna was fresh and good quality served at the right temperature.  The wasabi was especially strong which I like.  I also ordered the crab cake which is probably one of their signature dishes.  It was excellent.  There must be some type of connection between \"willow\", \"andora\", and \"Monterey bay fish grotto\".  They all have great crab cakes that seem to be made exactly the same.  I'm not sure what the \"damage\" was because Dave graciously paid the tab.  This is a good spot for better than average selection and quality of bar food in a nice atmosphere with good people.  I certainly would be happy to have a sit down meal here again, but I think the bar scene and probably the outdoor dining is the reason to visit this spot."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for date night. Made my reservation on OpenTable, but wanted to make sure I had a cozy table and called to speak with someone at the restaurant. Can't remember the name of the guy who helped me, but I explained that I was trying to treat my lady to a nice romantic evening. He immediately suggested sitting outdoors and that he would make sure i got a table by the fire. And he delivered! The table was perfect, literally right by the cozy fire. This service alone earned my praise. The restaurant is set in an old building up in the rolling hills of Ohara/Fox Chapel, so for us urbanites it is remote and rural-feeling while still be close to the city.   The dinner was very good. I had the seafood linguine, which comes with shrimp and spicy sausage. The shrimp was very fresh and delicious. My girlfriend raved about her salmon and her Moscow Mule was excellent.   All around excellent. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The Bartenders were excellent.  It was a busy Saturday evening, but they were willing to take the time to learn... and make... a drink that was new to them as long as they had the proper ingredients or suitable substitutes.  The wait staff was attentive but not intrusive.  But the food... well, it was just average.  Their signature dish, a crabcake, was tasty- lump crab meat, good seasoning, limited breading.  However, their main courses were basic in construction and flavor profile, lacking visual and taste contrast.  I had the chicken salitmbocca with parmesan risotto.  I simply could not distinguish between the flavor profile of the risotto and the saltimbocca sauce.  In the end, it tasted more like chicken fried chicken with bland country gravy."}
{"text":"Consistent.  You can always get a good meal and decent service here.  Cozy rooms and nice ambience."}
