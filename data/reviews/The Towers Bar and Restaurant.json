{"text":"A family meal...two teenagers two parents and a grandparent. I guess we are kind of pizza snobs, having been disappointed many times Irish bars and restaurants. Two of us decided to take the chance... And both were pleasantly surprised.  Teenager one is vegan and being too self conscious to ask if there was anything vegan, so she ordered salad and chips. They thoughtfully put some falafel in her salad. It was a fairly uninteresting salad without them. Teenager two had a steak... Rare. It was very good. Grandma had scallops. She loved them.
 So.. The food was good... The service wasn't great... Lots of staff and not much attention to diners....a pity really. Also...I can't understand the absence of proper and pepper grinders... Desert selection wasn't very compelling.

A few tweaks and they've got a good restaurant. They need sort it out... It was Â€100 w tip. I don't mind paying that.. but would like proper service and attention to detail"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat in Westport with live music and seafood, and we were fortunate  to stumble on The Towers right in the harbor. Delicious meal, friendly service, live music and lovely ambience. One of our sons ordered mussels and the tub was huge and the mussels very fresh and the wine sauce so good that he sopped it up with the brown bread. Our other son had fish and chips and just wait it was the best he has ever had. I had stuffed salmon wrapped in phillo dough. Delicious. 
Our server was lovely: friendly and attentive. 
We had a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Very good great food and has been in business in Westport for years.  The lamb and lasagna is excellent."}
{"text":"The Towers had a name for great food way back in the 90s but then solidly lost their way and started serving up some pretty mediocre fare with healthy price tags.

Happily, after a bit of a revamp recently (and change of ownership I think) the place has come alive and are producing some of the nicest food you'll get in Westport. 
It's not fine dining but its good quality with attentive staff and if you get a table at the back you get some wonderful views of the sea to add to the experience.
It doesn't cost the earth either which is definitely a bonus.

...also (for even more bonus points), they serve a very nice pint of Guinness."}
