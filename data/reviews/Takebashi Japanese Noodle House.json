{"text":"I very much enjoyed this place while it was open. It has recently closed and been replaced with another Ramen place, which is good - but different.  Does anyone know if Takebashi has just moved to a new location, and where that might be ?"}
{"text":"This is a place without fancy decoration.  The dining area is small but neat.  However, in terms of their ramen, I am a fan!  The ramen there is above average at that reasonable price.  And yes....their green tea ice-cream tempura is highly recommended.  The portion is not small.  It is good enough to be shared with 2 or even 4 persons as a dessert!"}
{"text":"I came here the other day with my best friend.  I've been here before, but didn't have much of a recollection of how good/bad it was.  So we decided to opt for some food.  We ordered a \"sake roll\" - which included salmon, avocado, cucumber, and masago on top.  I wasn't very impressed by the sushi.  It was a little dry, the salmon wasn't that great, and the contents within the maki fell out when I picked it up with my chopsticks.  I ordered the \"red miso ramen\" and my friend ordered the \"beef noodle.\"  The amount of food wasn't a lot - but as the previous reviewer said, \"it's good if you're on a diet.\"    I've found that the other ramen places that I've been to so far were much better.  However, the place is quite cheap."}
{"text":"Another yummy frugal eat place! I love having the House Noodles here. I must say they have put in less ingredients compared to previous years (been coming here for a LONG time). I don't come here often but always order the same thing so I know... :) There used to be much more mushroom, corn, meat, tempura (there used to be 2 !) etc. But for $ 6.50 it doesn't really matter I guess.   If you have room, try the green tea tempura ice cream!! A great delight!  Service is super fast, friendly. Parking can be a bitch on weekend at popular dinner hours."}
