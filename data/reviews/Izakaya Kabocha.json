{"text":"Like any proper izakaya, you will be (cheerfully) yelled at in Japanese when you walk in the door by everyone in the kitchen. It's a bit disconcerting but sort of wonderful if you just embrace it.  I am writing this review based on the squid ink poutine. It sounds ridiculous, looks like it'll be awful, but it'll be your favourite thing -- which is saying a lot, since we had lots of blow-torched mackerel and hay-smoked salmon that were amazing in their own right. The poutine was hearty and tasty and full of squid and even some beans thrown in for good measure. It can't be properly explained, you just have to try it.   Also, the servers were extremely attentive and nothing but prompt in getting our orders and filling our glasses throughout our stay.  Overall, given the fact that this a Japanese pub rather than a high-end resto, it hit the spot. With more than half of the clientele being Japanese, I wasn't alone in this."}
{"text":"Food was really top notch and beer prices very fair. I wanted to try this place. Have been to Imadake a couple of times and always found the food meh. I guess I have been spoiled by Guu in Toronto. The vibe on a Saturday night was pretty tame. It just didn't have that really loud vibe you would expect from a izakaya, but being a new restaurant and still early in springtime, this is understandable. I expect this place to be bustling come summertime, especially late at night. They have $16-17 pitchers but we opted for $5.50 Asahis instead. This got our appetite going which was a good thing since  the food started coming out fast. Portions were generous and I over ordered (like always) but still managed to finish almost everything. The tonkotsu ramen was by far my favorite. It wasn't too salty, the noodles were fresh and the pork and egg were plenty flavourful. The seafood yakisoba was nice and light which was nice which is in contrast to the squid ink curry poutine. Although the poutine was really good, the squid rings were slightly overcooked and there was too much black gravy by the end of it. The salmon sashimi was fresh and cut really thick which is the way I like it. The karaage was extra crispy, very meaty and not expensive at all. The only disappointing dish of the night was the hamburg. It literally was a hamburger patty on a sizzling plate with no asian spices or anything that made it worthwhile. But all in all the food was great. We were 3 people, ate like kings, and the bill came up to $40 per person tax, alcohol and tip included. The menu is diverse enough that you can go cheaper (think delicious ramen), more expensive, or just go for late night drinks and a snack. Oh and they take reservations."}
{"text":"L'ambiance est chaleureuse, le cadre mignon et les serveuses sympatiques. Voilà en résumé les points positifs ! Les plats (parce qu'au final c'est quand même le plus important) sont vraiment très moyen, manque d'originalité et parfois de saveur comme le porc bbq et son riz insipide. La soupe de ramen n'était pas vraiment chaude et le plat de poulet frit (4 morceauw!!wow!) au curry noir était baigné dans la sauce contrairement au porc. Rien de bien intéressant, basique sans plus."}
{"text":"Food was great and atmosphere as well, especially when you have 2 kids.  Was sat at the front of the restaurant at the community table and they opened the windows for us.  Kids had great time as well as great food.   The service was also outstanding.    Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Had the miso ramen, delicious broth but I'm pretty sure they were vermicelli noodles, not ramen noodles."}
{"text":"Ordered one miso ramen, waited 45 minutes. Inbetween, waitresses came up and said the food is coming out soon, only until realized that my food hasn't even started cooking. It wasn't like the restaurant was busy either - there were 2 other tables occupied besides me, and yet they didn't even realize that I was the only one without any food after sitting there for 45 minutes. No sincere apology, so I just got up and left. I can't speak for their food, but based on their services, DON'T EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance in the restaurant was really nice and the food was quite good too. I got the Hell Spicy Ramen which was amazing. Others at our table got different items like grilled beef, spicy chicken & rice, tempura & rice, sashimi, squid ink poutine etc. Everything looked and tasted really good.   The staff was very friendly but service was honestly very slow. We went there with a group of 8 and we ordered at the same time. But they brought each dish to the table with a fairly significant time interval. In fact, we had to wait almost 40 min between the first person and the last person at the table to get served, which was quite unusual for any restaurant. The service really took away lot of the shine from the delicious food. I hope this was an one-off experience because I really wish to come back here again for the food."}
{"text":"The Service (4.5/5) Went here recently with my boyfriend on date. It was a Wednesday night so it wasn't particularly busy. The staff were super friendly and welcoming and happy to answer any questions. In general the service was pretty good.   The Food (5/5) he food was really great, when I go out to eat I expect to be served something I wouldn't have been able to make my self at home, and that's exactly what I got. We had the Teppan Yaki (beef and veggies you can cook for yourself on your own little grill), the Mackerel (which they blowtorch right in front of you) , Buta Seiro (steamed pork and veggies) and Kabocha Creme Brulee for dessert. We also had some hot sake that was a great accompaniment to the meal. Everything is artfully plated and we didn't wait very long in between dishes.  The Price (4/5) All the food was excellent and the price fit the quality, though I felt the portions could be a teeny bit bigger.   Recommendations: I'd definitely recommend their creme brulee, it was  nice change from the usual green tea ice cream found at most east Asian restaurants in Montreal! We will definitely be back there, to try some of the more innovative things on the menu, like the Squid Ink Poutine."}
{"text":"Je suis TRÈS déçue. L'ambiance, le menu, le prix, le service, décevant.   1. Les petits bancs en bois sont extrêmement inconfortables.  2. Le menu n'est pas très varié et très cher 3. La serveuse revenait pas très souvent et ne débarrassait pas souvent la table. On a souvent manqué d'eau. Les plats commandés étaient oubliés.  3. La musique (non-japonaise) était bizarre et que dire des vidéos sur l'écran ??? Des vidéos de cascades Youtube, à ne rien comprendre.  4. Le staff n'est aucunement japonais, sauf les 2 à la cuisine.  5. On a commandé un plat à 24 $ (zembu-nose) et on devait faire griller la viande sur des tout petits plats en fonte au dessus du gaz. L'huile a volé partout sur la table, même dans mon visage, sur mes bras. C'était TRÈS désagréable et ça sentait très mauvais (le gaz). La serveuse a dû remplacer le gaz au moins 3 fois, et la plaque en fonte 2 ou 3 fois aussi.  6. Le poulet était coupé tellement gros qu'il était presqu'impossible de le cuire en entier.  7. Le dessert (crème brûlée kabocha) était chaud et d'une texture vraiment douteuse. 6.50$ en plus! 8. Dans les toilettes, des papiers ''cheap'' avec des phrases en japonais traduites en français, un gros bof. Je n'y retournerai pas. On dirait que ce restaurant est géré par des gens qui ne sont jamais allés au Japon. Bizarre.  ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful evening here. The food was delicious, different and fun. Maybe not your thing if you don't like loud noises, as they greet everyone in Japanese. The service was good, but maybe should be a little more attentive, especially with refilling glasses of water. But a great night's fun!"}
{"text":"The best izakaya you could find in Montreal. Reasonable price and amazing food. Service could have been better. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had the best experience here, super creative asian food (not sure how authentic because haven't visited japan yet). Izakaya pattern is (explained to us by the waiter) basically small portions of highly flavoured and cured food items so don't come here if you're someone who likes a bang foe your bucks. Come here with an attitude to appreciate east asian flavours and possibly spend a little more than average to truly enjoy this place.  First off, the ambience is absolutely amazing. Came here on a first date and our original choice of restaurant was closed so my date took me to a \"surprise spot\" and this was the place; was totally impressed by his selection because this is exactly the type of food pallette I love endeavoring myself with. Ambience is chill but not too casual. Noise level is good enough for conversations.  We started with hay smoked salmon which came in this ceramic bowl layered with hay stacks in the bottom. The waiter lighted it up and covered the salmons on a grill on top of it. We were to remove the lid after 2mins but we might have left it overtime so oit salmon was pretttyy smoked, kind of tasted like ash and cigarette. It wasn't my thing.  But then our drinks came and oh god my strawberry liquor think was an absolute goddess nectar. If you're into sweet and smooth alocholic drinks, then this is your drink. It had a japanese spirit and this milk like Japanese drink in it. I'm sorry that I forgot the name.  We also had chef's grill selection which is basically strips of marinated beef, chicken, octopus, shrimp and veggies with a side of chillinand hoysin sauce. You have to fry the raw meat on a crystal grill. Loved the chilli sauce with the chicken and beef and pairing the hoysin sauce with the mushrooms. This was an interactive way to participate with your \"ready made\" food and I had a marvellous time grilling and enjoying the warm and fresh meat and fish.  But the best part of my experience was the kimchi fried rice. Omg what is this thing. Soooo gooood. We took it because all the other reviews mentioned it and so glad that we did so. Just go for it. Trust me. You won't regret."}
{"text":"[My Order] :  ABURI SHIME-SABA  ( Was really happy with this - good combo of flavors of sour, salty, and sweet - Definitely order this)  GYU TEPPAN YAKI ( Grill it yourself style - a little gimmicky / overpriced )   BUTA SEIRO ( NOT LIKE THE PICTURE AT ALL- super plain and overpriced to the max -  do not order this)  KABOCHA (perhaps their namesake dish - it's the japanese pumpkin prepared in different tasty ways)  AGEDASHI DOFU (nice crispy batter, soft tofu, excellent tofu)  AGESOBA ( was interesting to taste the squid ink and fried noodles, but definitely too much of the same taste - kind of flat - also there are some beans that kinda make this dish look more unappetizing than it actually tastes )"}
{"text":"I was here two weeks ago for a little gathering for one of my co-workers that was leaving.  We decided to eat family style and share a bunch of appetizers including, Salmon Sushi, Sashimi Salad, LOTS of karaage (very good!), spicy chicken, squid ink poutine (surprisingly good) and I supplemented my meal with a Tuna Poke.  Everything was fantastic and we topped it of with shared tiramisu and squad cheese cake which were great as well.  Definitely will have to return with friends."}
{"text":"A small and cozy Japanese fusion restaurant caught our eyes while strolling around Quebec. A pleasant and cheerful waitress sat us down with virtually no waiting, how lucky was that? Within few minutes of placing our order, Yakiniku Teishoku (sauté beef) and Karaage Teishoku (deep fried chicken pieces) bento boxes delivered with coarsely mashed potatoes, marinated salmon pieces, fresh vinaigrette salad, and small bowl of rice came with each order. The sweet sauté beef with vegetables tasty enough, and fried tonkatsu-styled chicken was soft and tender. All came with their own sauce which must be used to deepen the flavor of the dish. Side order of Sashimi Trio rounded up our scrumptious lunch. The food presentation were beautiful, good and tasty entrees and reasonable price make us come back for more."}
{"text":"They honestly need a new photographer 'cuz their food taste much better than they look!! I had an all-in-one bento box and my friend had a sashimi bento--both are really good with fresh sashimi."}
{"text":"Very delicious food but very understaffed and slow service. Took 40+minutes for our edamame beans to arrive. They didn't have one of our orders and also forgot about two, but offered us a free cocktail and gave us a free desert. Took so long I almost lost my appetite. A shame, as the food is fantastic once it arrives."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptic upon walking in, because it was Friday evening and the restaurant was almost empty. Also, the decor looked underwhelming - but that's just me being fussy.  Prices looked ok, so we ordered an omakase box (for two). The drinks list had a large selection of Japanese alcohols, but unfortunately the lack of description made it difficult for non-connoisseurs to make a choice (e.g. Tamano Hikori Tokusen, Masumi Karakuchi Ki-Ippon). On the other hand, the cocktails were well explained. My boyfriends ordered a Kabocha cocktail (pumpkin sirop, Baileys, cinnamon, milk), which was quite good, although a tad watery.   We waited quite a bit for the food, but found it delicious. The omakase box was beautifully organized, and portions were satisfying. The tempura was hot and crispy, the sashimi fresh, the beef tender and flavourful. Even the fillers (pickles, veggies) were good.   Overall positive impression, but did not exceed expectations."}
{"text":"Great location on a busy street. Fresh seafood , good service ,great ambience and price ok. After dining you can also grab a famous ice cream~"}
{"text":"I had an excellent dish of sashimi on cold ramen with poached egg. Perfect for a summer afternoon. Ramen was perfectly cooked. Texture was just right. Firm and flavorful. Fish was fresh. Service was pleasant."}
{"text":"So, this place looked lovely and fun and the food looked enticing, but we were super disappointed. Drinks were adequate at best. Beef carpaccio was nicely presented but tasted mostly of onion and the sour daikon (or some other grated pickled veg)that topped the meat. My sashimi salad had three pieces of fish and consisted mostly of bonito flakes that tasted awful! The greens had no perceptible salad dressing. I tried removing the flakes but they were everywhere. I tried sending it back and it took several tries to track down a server. They said they would charge us for the salad if we sent it back. This was the first time I've ever attempted to send back food in my life and I didn't think it would be an issue. My husband dish was the teriyaki hamburger and vegetables. And a poached egg. There were no vegetables; only undercooked fries and onion. The burger was over cooked as was the egg.Try Imadake or Kazu for Izakaya. Never coming back to this place.  Update: They comped the salad in the end. Still not motivation enough to come back."}
{"text":"AU TOP !  Vraiment génial : peu cher, plus original que des sushis, et tellement bon !  On a pris la pieuvre marinée au wasabi, le porc avec les légumes dans le cuit vapeur, le tartare de saumon flambé et le maquereau vinaigré et flambé (devant moi !)... pas de préférence, tout était à tomber !! Vraiment VRAIMENT au top !  Et coté alcool, on s'est fait plaisir, avec cocktail vodka pamplemousse (le pamplemousse vient avec le presse-agrumes et débrouille toi ! c'est drôle :) ) et calpico et garigari (qui vient avec une gale bleue fluo dedans ! vraiment surprenant!)... On était bien ambiancé pour le reste de la soirée :D  ON REVIENDRA !!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place doesn't have more reviews or 5 stars?  Had the sashimi don and it was perfect...the hay smoking technique is brilliant!  Perfect drink pairing?  Asahi Extra Dry!  Eat here...post a review"}
{"text":"Cadre sympa mais la nourriture est simple et peu goutu.  J'ai pris le plat avec la viande de porc sur le riz. Ce n'est que de la viande légèrement marinée sur du riz blanc donc assez sec. Et pour le prix on pourrai s'attendre à mieux. Mais le personnel est vraiment sympathique donc cela console un peu."}
{"text":"Really tasty japanese delights. I especially liked the ramen. I also liked that they had weekly Sake discounts."}
{"text":"Excelente comida con bella presentación"}
{"text":"Le menu est carrément exotique. Je n'ai jamais été au Japon mais ces plats me semblent très authentiques. Les prix sont raisonnables, le personnel agréable et ce n'était pas très occupé.    Ma dégustation: - Sashimi de saumon au foin: un saumon flambé devant vous sur place. On sent l'odeur du brûlé qui aromatise le saumon. Show time!   - Les huîtres frites au panko : une recette originale qui satisfait l'amatrice de friture que je suis. Ça fait changement des crevettes panées.   -Shoyu Ramen: Mon premier ramen dans un restaurant. Eh oui! Le bouillon est tellement savoureux. - Un riz dont je ne retrouve plus le nom, assez épicé, mais bon c'est juste du riz.  Je reviendrais certaintement goûter à la crème brûlée à la courge kabocha. J'étais trop remplie pour en commander, c'est un must sur ma liste à l'avenir.  La poutine avait l'air débile, mais la serveuse a oublié de l'amener et c'est tant mieux, ça sera pour la prochaine fois!"}
{"text":"This place was so fun and fantastic. We ordered a large selection of the menu including the kabocha combo plate, smoked salmon sashimi, kimchi fried rice, and something where you cook everything (beef, chicken, shrimp, octopus, and veggies) on a small grill. All the plates were carefully prepared and the presentation was beautiful. My favourite dishes were the kimchi fried rice which contained extremely fresh mushrooms and eggs and the smoked salmon sashimi. It was fun seeing the staff greet all the entering guests- made for a lively atmosphere. The staff did seem to be still getting used to their new jobs- as they were chatting quite a bit instead of refilling water, tea etc. Nevertheless, I'll definitely be back to try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Sashimi boat delicious. Spicy miso ramen yummy. Service great except for the little bit of waiting. Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ate here with one other person, sat in the open window on a warm night and it was a great and affordable meal!   We chose it for being one of the cheaper options in the area, and having super cute ambiance (wooden chairs, outdoor seating, video games projected on a wall).   The sashimi box was a really good deal for dinner, that my dining companion got, and I got a mushroom soup. Everything was delicious, and more food than we could finish.  The beer was cold, service was friendly, they kept the water coming, and the place is super cute and had a great little birthday celebration for another patron while we were there that was very festive, but not too loud or obnoxious.   The \"ginger Moscow Mule\" (usually called just a Moscow Mule in the US) had ginger ale, not ginger beer, in it, which isn't super typical and wasn't terribly delicious. There are lots of other great, fun cocktails on the menu, and a cold Sapporo went great with the meal - just skip the Moscow Mule unless you want a vodka ginger ale.   Overall, will definitely want to go back here if I go back to Montreal! Highly recommend for dinner with a friend, a small birthday celebration, or a date."}
{"text":"The recommended chef dish \"yakiniku don\" was an absolute disaster. The meat was dry/rubbery, definitely not cooked by a trained chef. The taste was unbearable to the point that it was inedible. The other dish which I can't recall its name but it was supposed to have seafood with mushrooms, was also inedible. It literally consisted of rubbery squid rings, heaps of fried onions, and some mushrooms. My husband and I both didn't eat our dishes, waitress saw that we didn't eat our food but didn't say anything. What a waste of money. Avoid this place at all costs! bunch of young idiots calling themselves \"chefs\" what a joke."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants in town. While it's on a busy street in Montreal, there is enough space to accommodate your visit during a busy night! (Much better than other ones where you have to wait in line for 15 minutes+). They offered a wide array of Japanese specialities including tapas and larger portion meals such as Dons and Ramen. During my visit, I had a pint of Sapporo, edamame, salad, and a very unique Water Eel Omelette (first time I've ever seen this dish.) If you are looking for a fun environment and to experience Japanese culture in Montreal - here is the spot!"}
{"text":"Super découverte !  Nous avons pris un plateau avec plein de petites choses différentes à partager : du cuit et du cru (surtout). Tout était délicieux ! Et contrairement à ce que l'on pourrait croire c'était assez copieux."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our food. We had a sashimi (6 variety), a raw octopus salad, a box size sushi, and a hay smoked salmon. I like them all but the wasabi in the salad was too strong for me, caution required if you never tried it.  The service was good too. The greetings from the waiter and waitress is not like other izakaya. They don't shout out aloud their greetings. I think this is more comfortable for me.  Like the place will go again."}
{"text":"The food does not taste as good as it looks in the photos. Go to Big in Japan instead; they have a smaller menu, but the food there is amazing."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and service was so bad. Was so disappointed.  I ordered chicken tori and then gave me a plate of raw chicken with a 3x3 pan.  And this was after my husband was already done with his food. I thought the food was taking long thinking cooking chicken took awhile.  If they were going to give me a plate of raw chicken, shouldn't they have brought out the dish before my husbands appetizer and ramen?   So ridiculous."}
{"text":"Nouvelle izakaya sur St-Laurent, entre Prince-Arthur & Des Pins. Mardi soir, 19h, quelques clients déjà mais pas foule, reçu comme il se doit dans une restaurant comme au Japon. Tous les employés, vous souhaites la bienvenue ( ???????? ! ). J'ai mangé au bar avec un ami, le menu est sensiblement comme les autres izakayas montréalaises, les prix aussi. La nourriture était bonne mais sans plus dans mon cas, mon ami a beaucoup aimé. La déco est minimaliste comme la plupart des restaurants japonais, mais il me semble que ça aurait pu être mieux, il manque quelques choses. Y'a une belle table en bois à l'entrée sur votre droite. J'ai donné un point de plus pour le service, car notre serveuse était toujours attentive pour nous servir. Vous pouvez pratiquer aussi un peu votre japonais car le personnel est 100% japonais ici. Le proprio est d'ailleurs japonais, c'est son 1er établissement en Amérique du Nord, il en possède déjà au Japon & en Chine. J'ai terminé le repas avec un verre d'umeshu (vin de prunes, typiquement japonais). J'y retournerai peut-être d'ici quelques mois. 4/5 visité en février 2015."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my meal there. My friend and I shared the yasai dengaku (vegetables in Miso sauce), which was very disappointing. The sauce was good but the veggies were not cooked and the whole thing was cold. We also shared the karaage (ginger and garlic fried chicken), which tasted good but the batter was not crispy and the quality of the chicken was unsatisfactory, to say the least (no one likes a piece of chicken fat rolling in their mouth for 30 seconds). The best thing we had was the pork over rice, but again, it was nothing special and we had to ask for hot sauce to make it more flavorful. Overall our meal was very bland, including the sake we had. There are many good izakayas in Montreal now, don't waste your time at this one."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Must try the fresh hamaichi sashimi and the miso tankatsu ramen!! Some of the best ramen i have ever tried!!"}
{"text":"I went there on a Monday night with a friend that I haven't seen in a long time. It's a really good place to go if you want to spend quality intimate time with someone. We weren't rushed at all.   We ordered the zenbu-nose wich is a plate of raw meat and veggies that you grill on your own. It was good. We also had the aburi tuna (sushi flambé) which was also pretty good. I would come back here again to try other things in the menu."}
{"text":"For me Kabocha used to be the best Izakaya in Montreal. I used to go there every month when I lived in dt. But today I went there again, although the layout the decorations or even the price are still the same, but the menu was totally changed and the taste is not like before any more. So sad I feel like me favorite Izakaya is gone"}
{"text":"This place has a nice, dim ambience and the fusion food is delicious! I only came here once and took a risk and tried the squid ink poutine. I know. I was a bit weirded out too but it was the best decision! The squid ink gravy complemented the fries so well and made it very savory and delicious! There wasn't a lot of cheese curds or gravy for that matter so wouldn't neccessarily call it poutine but love the creativity of the food. Next time, since this is a bar style restaurant, will definitely get some drinks and probably some food since the chicken karage looked bomb!"}
{"text":"I had plain ramen in chicken broth, and my husband had the pork ramen in spicy broth. It was excellent! We also got the litchi sake. Can't wait to go back!"}
