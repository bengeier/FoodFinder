{"text":"Girlfriend and I decided to try this place out.  Went there this afternoon and was very pleased with the service and food.  Stacy was taking care of us and she did a great job.  I had the Junior Cheeseburger and it was done perfect and very tasty.  Girlfriend had the Cuban which I had a taste of and it was very good.  Asked for the fries crispy with Cajun seasoning and they came out great.  The menu has a good variety, we plan to go back and try some of the other offerings.  Would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars if It was allowed.  Food was horrible.  They were out of hamburgers.  How can you be out of hamburgers if you're a hamburger joint?  Wings are child size and the food looks nothing like its typed on the menu.  The service was horrendous.  1 waitress for 10+ tables in a packed house?  Waitress telling customers to order food at bar, bartender getting mad cause she was telling people to order from waitress instead.   I waited 20 minutes before my order was taken and that's cause I asked the waitress for service and she said to wait 5 more minutes.    I will never come back to this place ever again.  Even when the place is dead you still have to wait 20 minutes for service."}
{"text":"We heard that this place had just opened recently and decided to check it out. We happened to get there just as they were opening, so the place empty, but I'm glad we stayed. We had the parmesan wings and burgers. The wings were very crispy and had a great garlic flavor. Small, but a generous number of them were in the order. I had the Kickstart Burger and I'll definitely be heading back again soon! The burgers were huge. Handmade patties, they were juicy, cooked well and delicious. Fries weren't anything special, but were satisfying enough. Service was a little gruff but friendly. The menu is limited, but I believe they're planning on adding to it as they settle in."}
