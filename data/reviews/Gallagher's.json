{"text":"Got my iced tea and then waited for over an hour with no service. Left without eating, and will not return. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Fried zucchini was refrigerator cold when served. Chicken tenders overdone. Tasted like oil was rancid. Server told us it would take about 20 or so minutes for our food, as a large order was before ours. 6:30pm, about  full. We had to flag down the server to get the zucchini taken care of. Large chunks of zucchini dripping with grease.  Do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I much prefer drinking here to eating here.  Sometimes it is the only place close and I decide to order food and I always regret it.  I'm a vegetarian so maybe I'm too limited and the burgers are awesome   So stick to traditional fare.  The salads my daughter and I had yesterday were pathetic"}
{"text":"Note to self - yelp has a mobile app, use it! I wish I would have read the reviews for this place before stopping in for lunch but I was in the area and figured a chain couldn't be bad. Ha!  A sign told us to seat ourselves so we did. A server stopped by and asked if we wanted something to drink. We all ordered but I almost had to argue with the server to get a root beer. She told me it was from the tap and was $4.50; she said this like she was trying to talk me out of it but she did add that I would get free refills. Ha! More on this later. She didn't give us menus and left for about five minutes. When she returned she brought menus but forgot the straws so she disappeared again. I should note that there were three servers for six occupied tables.  We finally got to order. I had the parmesan chicken sandwich. It was pretty bland. I got potato salad for a side, also bland. I tried the Philly Cheesesteak and, yep - bland. I also tried the fries. They were OK.  The server never did stop by to see if everything was OK or to refill our drinks. I waited patiently for my check and finally got up and hunted her down. She was chatting with the other servers. I got my check, paid cash so I wouldn't have to spend any more time and left. On the way out I noticed a sign that said we were entitled to a free dessert. Someone might want to mention it to the server.  Overall, bland food, terrible service and an expensive root beer."}
{"text":"Beer on tap was Luke-warm and was harassed by belligerent customers to the point of changing seats. Multiple patrons at bar were served after being way over intoxicated.  Bartender was discussing upcoming court date about Dui and prescription drug offenses with customers. I just wanted to watch hockey play-off game. One of worst bar experiences of my life. And I'm a 40 years old male... Will never go back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  A very large menu with lots of stuff... I've had the boneless hot wings (not wonderful, but still tasty... I'll order hotter next time) and the chicken fajita salad (hurt myself cause I couldn't stop eating it). Lots of different wing flavor options. I'm not a drinker, so all I care about is the food, but I know my fiance got excited because a large draft bud light was 2.50 (I guess that's good? haha I don't know). Relaxed atmosphere, but yes, I've had to go up to the bar to order my food since there doesn't seem to be a waitstaff here (that doesn't bother me one bit). I have a feeling I'll be seeing this place a lot in the future."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant, and while the service was fine, I hardly call this \"food\". I ordered fajitas and the spinach queso, to share with the hubby. We were afraid it wouldn't be enough food, but the servings we decent sized, and we STILL couldn't finish them. No reason to eat more than to have something in your belly, because the food isn't good enough to finish. Reminds me of the pre-packaged stuff you get warmed up at event venues, or amusement parks. Fatty, over-salted, and with wilted veggies.   I also question how clean everything is...the appetizer plates and tortilla warmers were covered in greasy smears and fingerprints. And the plates were recently \"washed\".  I would come back for a happy-hour beer, but nothing more..."}
{"text":"My wife ordered the chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes and I had the hickory burger. I ordered the burger medium,  it came more done than I like and had a pretty chard like flavor, it was ok, but can get a much better burger in a drive thru. The chicken fried chicken was not good.  The chicken had a weird cornmeal flavor and the gravy tasted gross.  Had a younger server, was not on his game, seemed like he didn't want to be there.  We have come here a few times for football games but not sure we will return, was poor quality all around."}
{"text":"Second visit Great patio but so many damn flies- and it's been like that for months- seriously need a fly trap- in my beer, food, all over the tables- disgusting."}
{"text":"Best March 17th!! Jake and the crew made it happen! Seating was fast and service was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss. Sometimes you'll get a really good server while other times you'll get a terrible one. Those terrible ones consist of waiting for what seems like 20 minutes for your drink order to come, then another 30 for your food, all the while they're off doing who knows what. The manager is probably the most customer-friendly food service manager I've seen. If he catches wind that you're not having the best service he's there to make up for it.  Aside from that its your typical sports bar.  I was here in May 2014. You used to be able to sit yourself wherever you wanted but now they have it set up where they seat you. I guess that works for them because they're regular dining area is kind of cut off from their bar area so servers may not realize people are back there.  Food is alright. Some things aren't worth the money but it is what it is. I think its Wednesdays in which they have 50 cent wings if that's something you're interested in."}
{"text":"Good news - Gallagher's on Union Hills is back!  We had been going to this bar for years and then it closed.  Reopened as \"Cheerleaders\" and was God-awful.  Then Gallagher's came back and their menu is more extensive and the food is even better.  They're in the process of remodeling and we were told will have new seating in the dining area so bare with the crappy booth seats for now.  We've have the wings every time and they've never failed us - also breaded zucchini is so much better - light Pachenko type of batter.  We've also had the sliders - meat portion was good but they need to improve on the buns as they were kind of stale store bought kind.  Other than that, the food is great and tons of TV's to watch sports on!"}
{"text":"Went with the Wife for our first trip ever to Gallagher's.  It has a great menu and I was totally surprised that for a Saturday night it was pretty dead.  We ordered appetizer (mushroom and zucchini) and the half rack ribs which were on special.    Our server was uumm how you say...different?  Not very friendly for someone who works with customers but we were hungry, new to the area, hungry, and wanted someone to cook for us.  It took awhile for the apps to come, he did ask if we wanted them first, and yes, they did come first.  2 min later, here comes dinner!!  Now this is a pet peeve.  I spent enough time in a kitchen to know you hold the main course order until the appetizer is done and they customer is ready for the main course.  The fried veggies were ok, I love deep fried mushrooms, and these were on the low end of good.  The dinner however was far from good.  Ribs were dry, over cooked but had good sauce,  baked potato was over done, and putting frozen butter on to a luke warm over cooked potato just does not help much.  The garlic toast was yummy, but not worth what you pay for the rib dinner.  Wife had twice baked potato and it looked like a mess.  I don't think she liked it much and her steamed veggies were awful.  $37 for some crappy food and mediocre service.  Sorry guys....wont be coming back ever.  Wow....I hate it when going out on a Saturday is such a bad experience.  Should have just grabbed some Samurai Sams and headed home to watch the ASU game."}
{"text":"Waited 54 minutes for our food!!! Told the manager and he never once apologized. He just said \"let me see what's going on\". Then when we finally got our food it was barely warm and MEDIOCRE at best. This was out second time in. The 1st time also took forever and I remember the food being bland.  We live right down the street and will never step foot in here again. They need new management and more staff here"}
{"text":"I have to say this place is so much fun. We did part of Pinnacle on Thursday and worked up quite an appetite for food and more adventure.  We go here often as they have everything we need: A fun atmosphere, friendly servers who know what they are doing (we have a few favorites), a good variety of food (veggie option), online trivia, sports on the many TV's throughout, patio, OTB, full bar, and a vending machine that dispenses little bouncy balls. What more can you ask for?  One more thing it seems. It just so happens on last Thursday, and possibly every Thursday they have live trivia, like as in run by a real life person who repeats the question (thank you :) ) - it started at 7:30pm I think - double check that. I didn't know this in advance so it was a happy surprise and so entertaining. They give the winner a gift - I think that's pretty cool. The winner wasn't me BTW, not by a long shot but it was a good time.  Are there times they are busy and you have to wait for a seat or you have to ask for something twice? Probably. Nothing I can think of off hand but it happens to the best of us. Back in the day I served beer and bread so I know how demanding the job is. It's where we go to have a good time and I hope you do too!"}
{"text":"Went to try this place out.  Alas... it is no more.  From the more recent reviews, guess this shouldn't be a surprise."}
{"text":"Ok on Sundays I go to gallagars because of Wendy she is friendly. Always bubbly and happy."}
{"text":"I normal have a great experience here but this time I think they had the dishwasher make my grilled salmon salad. No diamond grill marks, two small tailpieces and the lettuce was wilted. I should have known better when I saw the \"Seat Yourself\" sign. I will give them only one more chance but that's it..."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Went with my sons for all you can eat fish. After 45 min of waiting....no fish. We left very disappointed. What a sad waste of time."}
{"text":"Just left restaurant without eating. Waitress ignored my mother and I.  Apparently you don't serve elderly patrons. Will never go again."}
{"text":"Love the food and the iced tea is delicious. Service is good and the atmosphere is great. My boyfriend and I eat here all the time.  Tried other bar and grill places didn't like so I always come back."}
{"text":"We have been to this location before and really enjoyed it, but this visit was not enjoyable. The waitress was nice, but not quick. My husband ordered the Bourbon boneless buffalo wings which looked dry and tasted disgusting, my husband finished them but didn't touch the second round of hot wings. We sat out on the patio and notice a cockroach crawling around on the pillars. My husband really enjoys this location so I am sure we will give it another try, but this time around I give them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Wings are good. Beer is cheap during hh.  Lots of tv's."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. \"Wing Wednesday\" 99¢ wings...and they are barely bigger than your thumb. They are small, dry and overcooked. I've given them FOUR different chances, thinking maybe they just had a bad batch one week. Nope. They are always like this."}
{"text":"The service was good. The girl behind the bar was moving to help a good crowd. Blu cheese burger sounded good but as quickly as it came out you knew it wasn't prepared very well. Lettuce looked like it was sitting around, burger wasn't very tasty, the fries were good! Too many other bar food places in the area. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Probably the worst food I have ever eaten ,I enquired at the end of my meal how this place ever got a food license ??"}
{"text":"Very disappointed today.  Stopped in for some wings and drinks. Apparently management decided to send some staff home for lack of traffic. Unfortunately there were not enough staff to take care of the customers that did show up. After waiting far too long, had to go to the bar multiple times to order and deliver our own drinks. This was a problem a year ago and it seemed management got the message and service became very good. Don't know if this is going to continue but it does will be returning very often."}
{"text":"Descent place. Never full capacity, so it's a great place to watch Sunday or Monday Night Football or even Baseball. Okay, even hockey!. Plenty of TV's throughout. Huge outdoor seating area with outdoor bar and a very large dinning indoors surrounding a horseshoe bar. The food is good (try the tenderloin skewers), the staff is very friendly and helpful. It's a bit off the beaten path, but worth the drive if you want a guaranteed seat and be able to hear the action on the screen."}
{"text":"Unfortunately didn't get to try this place. No body here on a saturday night was wondering why. Walked in, ordered a Corona, but they claimed they were all out. Waitress extremely rude!! Ordered a raspberry tea, that taste like dirty tap water. First and last time I will ever visit here. John Taffern - this place could use your help!!"}
{"text":"This place need's some serious attention. Like other reviewers we want to like this place because it is close to our home. We've been there at least 6 times in the last year and every time we have been disappointed. The service is horrible and that's being very nice. They honestly have no idea how to run a restaurant. We've wanted extended periods of time for service to the point that we joke about it now. Living in cave creek it offers a convinent location so we keep subjecting ourselves to this misery. After tonight we will never go back. We came in and had to seat ourselves because no hostess was there. We then waited over 15 minutes for our drinks and the menus. There were only about 3-4 other tables needing service so the place was not busy at all. The waiter walked past us several times and then ended up chatting with another table for several minutes and never even took our food order. We were so frustrated that we spoke with the manager who really didn't show much concern at all. We finished our drinks and headed across the street to Wendy's where the service was perfect!"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant/bar. Good food and cold beer. Service at the bar and in the restaurant is friendly and attentive. They have live music outside on the patio as well. It's a good place to eat and drink."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Gallagher's overall, but that's primarily because of what it is - a sports bar - which I tend not to frequent, for a couple of reasons: 1. I don't like sports, and 2. they aren't usually very veggie friendly, unless you like salad, which I don't. Gallagher's though, serves up a pretty good veggie burger. You've got a couple of options when ordering - you can either build your own Gallaburger (B.Y.O.G.), or order one of the other burger options and just substitute the veggie patty. There are quite a few to choose from, some better than others, some actually pretty fucking good, like the Baja Burger with jalapeño jack cheese, sliced avocado and fresh salsa (I think this one comes with bacon by default, but from my experience, they're very receptive to mixing and matching, which is nice). Or the Maui Burger with swiss cheese, teriyaki sauce and pineapple salsa."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! First waited forever for seating and then wanted to separate us. Now we wait even longer for the food! Horrible!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour deals! Awesome food! Great local restaraunt/bar :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome breakfast and lunch with my family. I ordered the fried cheese curds for my appetizer, they were delicious!!! Next came my breakfast plate  Called the Rookie , perfectly done scrambled eggs , crispy country potatoes and 4 slices of thick rye toast . I would recommend this Restaurant !!! Great place to watch Football games too"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a Sat. lunch.  Only 1 waitress was available.  She had the outside area plus inside.  We ordered sandwiches and when they came, we opened the napkin to get the silverware and were shocked.  The silverware was disgustingly dirty with film and stains.  I reached to another empty table and tried that silverware, same thing.   We finally waited 10 minutes (while our sandwiches got cold) till we could get our waitress.   We asked for the manager.  He came to the table and when I showed him the silverware, he said he'd make sure this problem was taken care of.  No apology. The waitress came back and handled us two sets of wrapped silverware.   I said, \"Are these clean?\"   She assured us that they were clean.   I opened the wrapped silverware and they were just as dirty.  Now almost 20 minutes have gone by and we still don't have clean silverware.  The waitress finally came back with partially cleaned silverware.    We finished our lunch and then sat almost 10 minutes waiting for our check.  The waitress was no were to be seen  My husband then waked to the bar, where the manager was socializing with the pretty bar maid.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and the service gets worse every time. How this is possible when the ratio of staff to customers is 2 to 1. Sat at the bar tonight when a waitress came up and loudly exclaimed \"someone needs to buy me a shot or I'm going to kill someone\" and then proceeded to complain about a customer. Its really really sad because the cooks put out such good food. The staff ruins the experience. If you are in the area drive a few more miles up into Cave Creek for a better experience."}
{"text":"I've been to this location maybe 20-30 times over the past couple years, and it's always been a dependable place to go. Decent food, decent beer, friendly service, lots of TVs, specials, etc. That was until last night, which was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at any restaurant or bar. I rarely feel the need to take the time out of my day to complain, but this event is deserving.   First, lets talk about service. There was a new waitress, and she seemed about as qualified to be a waitress as I am qualified to be a brain surgeon (and trust me, nobody wants me operating on them). She didn't know any of the specials, she got my friend's order wrong (a wrap instead of a sandwich), and she rarely checked in on the table. We sat with empty glasses for most of the night. I honestly don't know how someone like her gets hired. Then, when it came time to pay, we asked for the check to be split. I wish I was exaggerating when I say that it was 25 minutes later when the GM finally came over to claim that their \"screen was freezing\" and they weren't able to split the checks. And this 25 minutes came after another 20 while we were waiting for someone to come back near our table so that we could even ask for the check in the first place.   Now, if those issues weren't already enough, before we ordered, a cockroach started climbing up my friend's leg. We were able to kill it, and notified the waitress who told the GM. He shrugged it off and was actually laughing when he came over to pick the dead roach; he gave no immediate apology or explanation. When my friend's food came out as a wrap instead of a sandwich, already being grossed out by the roach incident, he decided just to send the food back. It wasn't until this happened that the manager finally came over to half-heartedly apologize for the roach, saying that \"they come out when the weather is hot.\" I'm sorry, if his explanation is true, then I should pretty much see roaches at every business and restaurant I go to in the Phoenix area. He offered to buy us a round of drinks, but we declined the offer.   After the check splitting problem, the GM told us that he was the new GM (as of 4 days ago) and that we could mention his name the next time we came to get a free appetizer. I can't speak for my friends, but I know that I won't be going back to this establishment. Especially after reading the health inspection reports from the county, I am now not surprised that we encountered the cockroach. The last two inspections have instances of food with no expiration dates or food still in the walk-in that was expired. There were hand-washing violations, and some raw food was too close to other foods. This makes me wonder what dirty, contaminated, or expired food I've eaten at Gallaghers over the last few years. All of this is unfortunate, but the quality of this restaurant has clearly degraded over the past few years. It's pretty clear that this restaurant now does not care about the cleanliness of their establishment or the safety of their customers. Maybe the new GM will turn things around, but given his reactions last night, I highly doubt it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been here before and never had a problem.  The food is nothing special but they have great hamburgers.  Tonight we had the worst service.  First we seated ourselves, then the waiter failed to tell us about specials and really didn't say much after he asked what we wanted to drink.  He tossed our food onto the table as he ran by, after a long wait for the food.  He never checked on us, we had to get silverware from another table nearby.  We were there around 5 pm so there wasn't much of a crowd, even with the NCAA tournament on all the screens.  The food was good but the service was so abysmal I could only give 2 stars."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times in the past and had a decent lunch. But my lunch today will force me not to go back.  I ordered a Southwestern Cobb Salad.  Service was decent and our order was out in a reasonable time.  But after eating a little of the salad, I discovered a latex glove at the bottom of the salad bowl.  A very disgusting and unreasonable thing to find.  The manager did come out to the table to retrieve the plate and appologize.  The waitress came back shortly and said our lunches were covered.   The manager did not bother to return."}
{"text":"This was the last time we will vistit.The food has always been bland, but now the prices have gone up. When on an early Friday evening, sat in the bar, and expected happy hour prices as stated on the table tent. We didn't receive them and when we questioned the waiter, we told we should have asked for them. How much more clear should it have been when we order draft beer and cheese stix? We could have paid less for better quality down the street. You're better off with a boring chain like Chili's or Applebee's, better food and better prices"}
{"text":"Horrible service and theives the wait or tried to take my change after we paid for our bill"}
{"text":"Too bad used to go here frequently with vendors or just for wings after work, they are not very fast most of the time, but food and drinks were mostly consistently good, today that all went downhill, went with co worker at 1135am for lunch ordered burgers wings fries and 2 waters, got waters right away, waitress friendly, came by about 12 and said she saw food it would be right out...1215 no food, she sId the kitchen got backed up due to health inspection! 1217 we left went to DQ! Customers first idiots- if I have to wait then at least let me know coworker is hourly and list pay, such crap, I will find other places to eat!"}
{"text":"I live around the corner (walking distance) from this corporate bar.  The only time I ever enter a corporate establishment is when I'm slumming . . that's right, I said slumming.  This is the typical neighborhood watering hole, complete with a mediocre beer selection and uninspiring menu.  The food is OK, but what I don't like about this place is that when I ordered a salad they brought out a very small ramekin of dressing.  Then they had the audacity to charge for more.  The manager even had the gall to suggest they made their own dressing.  I'm calling BS!  I've worked in kitchens, including fine dining, and this was your typical Sysco product.  The ONLY reason I'd go back to this restaurant is if a large group I was part of wanted to go despite my objections."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. The atmosphere is nice. The servers are friendly and attentive. The food is just bland. I've tried many things on the menu in my quest to like this place. The food is edible, but just not good."}
{"text":"this place is our main stay for good happy hour , lunch or dinner. the food is good and the service is usally top notch."}
{"text":"Service? What service? They have good food, beer, and TVs, but don't expect any service. Waited over 10 minutes for someone to greet my family and I. Then waited over 20 minutes to order. It would have been longer if we didn't say something. If you don't mind long waits and being ignored, come here!"}
{"text":"3 stars is a little generous. It should be somewhere between 2-3. It's a good enough atmosphere and had solid lunch crowd (though, there isn't much else around).  Standard sports bar fare with an emphasis on wings. There were plenty of TV's and it looked like a decent bar.  For lunch, though, it was nothing special. My server was good: attentive and efficient, but no hovering.  I had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap (grilled). The flavor was good, spicy but not too hot. The. Chicken was clearly precooked and a little rubbery. The Cole slaw was fine, but nothing special. Supposed to be made on premise.  I've had plenty of premade that was every bit as good. Finally, the iced tea was just bad - even lemon wedges couldn't help it. New water  filter time, maybe?  Sorry tips pile on, but maybe time to update the music - '70's AOR may have finally expired and that's my era..."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another chance.   It was even worse than last time.   Food quality declined.   Reuben sandwich bread was total wet mush on one side, pizza wasn't what we ordered and was basically something cheap from the frozen food section in grocery store (yuck), fried calamari had so much fried batter that we could barely taste the calamari...if you want to sit outside and enjoy the fresh air forget it.  Only air you'll breath is from all of the smokers.  YUCK.  won't likely return."}
{"text":"I got a buffalo chicken wrap, fiance got nachos and a salad, and friend got chicken soft tacos, which amounted to just chicken and globs of cheese.  I haven't written many reviews, but I'm going to start now.  I wouldn't go back unless it was absolutely necessary.  I will say our waitress was pretty nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Great hang out. Huge menu, I have tried about a third of it and the only thing I am not a big fan of is their smoked meat. I am a home smoker, so I may be biased. The staff is great and accomidating.   The bar is what I really like. They have off track betting on the horses and dogs, which is fun. There are are so many TV's, that where ever you look, you'll find one. Whoever is behind the bar is friendly and (usually) a kick in the pants."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed to receive my bill and notice that we were charged for ice in our scotch. Our waiter was terrific, overworked as he was handling the whole dining area. The food was decent, but the overall experience was not worth the prices that are being charged. $2.31 add on for ice in our drinks. Absurd!"}
{"text":"NEW MENU UPDATE  Looks like they re-vamped the entire menu!!! So far we've tried a few things including wings (the new Fireball sauce is awesome), the steak fries are superb & extra yummy with garlic, the Cubano is bueno, and the patty melt (add hatch chilis) is my new fav burger.   I come here every week anyway, but now I'm excited because all of the new things to try.  The bartenders are very seasoned and get food out fast and hot. We have been going there for a years now and are always greeted by name and treated awesome. Great neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"I want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there aren't many other options around here, but this is probably the worst restaurant/bar I've ever had the misfortune of going to.   My last trip I sat down to order a beer at the bar.  The bartender takes about five minutes to get me a beer, despite the bar being nearly empty, as he was too busy for me with his time and focus instead spent flirting with one of the servers.    I drink my beer and want another.  The glass sits empty for about five minutes while he paces around the bar.  I try on three occasions to get his attention and ask for another.  The dude is just ignoring me at this point.  I guess they don't want my business and I just leave.  He can have the 8 cents he owes me in change for a tip... I just want out of here.  I feel bad when I leave that he even got the 8 cents from me.  I hope he spends it well.  On other trips here my wife and I have had the food.  It's not any better than the service sadly.  I have an English Bulldog at home with a poop eating problem and I'm not sure he would even find this food acceptable.  Overall just the worst restaurant around and it's no surprise why the place always looks so dead out front.  Nobody's there because it's simply horrible.  Avoid at all cost.  I wouldn't eat here again, but would give the bar another shot if I heard the replaced all the help.  Whoever owns this place needs to clean house.  Looking at other reviews on here, I see I'm not alone in my feelings about the service.  Get rid of these people already... just sad!!"}
{"text":"This place sucked 5 years ago. Food is much better. I was sitting next to a couple watching NFL. They agreed it has improved significantly i recommend it now"}
{"text":"Been eating there occasionally over 4 years.  No more.  Several recent visits with poor food and reluctant service.  Soggy salads, fries; overcooked dry fish, burgers.  Cottage cheese is a winner!  It's all about beer and liquor, not food."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this place in a long time, but since close to my house I decided to stop by today.  Interior has been completely changed since last time I was there.  It was late morning and pretty empty.  Waitress - not a very friendly person - came up and asked if I wanted anything to drink.  Yes and what I wanted.  Mind you, there is hardly anyone in this place.  She disappeared in the back and I didn't get my drink until about 12 minutes later. I saw it, my drink had been sitting there waiting to get served for quite a while. Pretty pathetic. That drink done, it just sat there empty for quite a while in plain view.  She went by to other tables but didn't even bother to ask if I needed something else, much less to take my order for food.    After quite a while a manager comes up.  You need anything? Looked him square in the eye and told him you have terrible service here. I didn't ask for a manager, don't know why he came to my table, but he took responsibility for it right off and he went to bat.  Was there every 5 minutes.  I'll give him kudos for that and it made the experience not too shabby.  Still, that waitress........"}
{"text":"If your looking for a great wing selection this is the place to go on Wednesdays. They do the standard 40 cent wings but have a large variety of flavors.  Personal favorite is the Triple H. Only issue was service was lacking last time I was in.  Usually have great service but was stuck waiting 30 minutes for check even though only 3 other tables in the bar. Will be going back real soon but not until later in the day."}
{"text":"0 stars!! This has got to be the worst service in town! Been waiting at least 45 minutes for our food. Our male server continually avoids our table. Have had to ask for our drinks at least 3 times. I live in Cave Creek and will never be back here. The service has sucked since the start."}
{"text":"My first time at this location. I realized I had a gift card from a year or so ago and I wanted to see if it still worked. I had an awesome waitress who took my order and was very pleasant, always smiling and very sweet. I will be going back to this location in hopes of having the same waitress and great customer service.   Thank you Vanessa and thank you Gallagher's!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I have been to Gallagher's many times over the years because I work in the area.  I have been there for lunch, dinner, done take out and had company celebrations at this location.   The food is usually pretty good, although the last few times I've had some issues with quality.  However the service is always on point for the most part so I continue to return.  Recently I went with a friend to dinner to catch up and there was a shift change while we were there. The waitress brought one receipt when we had asked to have 2 separate receipts.  She came back and we were so engrossed in our conversation I just gave the waitress my card without looking at the receipt.  My friend paid in cash.  The next morning I saw on my account that I had paid way more than I should have.  I pulled out my receipt and saw that it had both our meals on there.  I called and talked to Mike an afternoon manager and he was very helpful and courteous.  He listened to me and took all my info including the receipt info and looked into for me.  Called me back the same afternoon and told me it would be hard putting the money back on my card, so I asked if I could just get a free salad next time I came in,  he said no problem!  Wrote my name down and I put all the info on the back of my receipt as well as proof of our conversation.  Fast forward about a week or so later, I decided I would order my salad.  I went to pick it up and the person I talked to got the manager on duty right away which I figured would be a normal procedure, no big deal.  A man introduced himself to me as Jake and I told him what happened and showed him the receipt with all the info Mike had previously given me. He made a face and said the other manager didn't know (know what?  I have no idea) He said that two people couldn't pay for the same thing because their registers would catch that (huh?) And he needed to go check the information out. I was a little annoyed at this point because I felt like he was calling me a liar and I was standing in the middle of the bar area with customers looking at me. He came back with a copy of a receipt that looked like mine but with a different waitresses name and time stamp and said my friend didn't pay for hers and I paid for both meals (how would he know that without her receipt) and that it's OK he'll pay for mine now.  Um,  I saw my friend pay her bill in cash and leave a tip. Whatever I didn't even argue. This experience left a sour taste in my mouth.  I stood there feeling like I was stealing or lying to get a $10 salad.  I won't be going back or recommending any longer."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow but not horrible the food was very good though and seemed reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Just left here after sitting at a table for 30 minutes with no service. At one point a waiter came by maybe 15 minutes after we sat down to give us menus but that was all. Won't be going back there ever again as they obviously don't give a crap about their customers."}
{"text":"Great people watching, dive bar-esque. One time we were in, the karaoke DJ dedicated feel like making love. To his mother for Mother's Day. No joke. If you're cool with watching your bartender eat food and snack on fruit non stop behind the bar and don't care about unevenly padded barstools, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Great Bloody Mary's.  I had the guacamole burger and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"Good place to watch sports and chow down. They have daily specials on food, and food on reverse happy hour (10-cl). Everything I've had there has rocked! The burgers (on special Mondays) are awesome and the shrimp tacos (Tuesdays for a Buck each) are sooo good. The big domestic drafts are 2.50 during happy hours, though the liquor is a little pricey on average. Oh yea the boneless wings (2.99 during any happy hour set) are totally kicking for the price, with a wide selection of flavors, honey hot is a favorite, and the regular wings are 40¢ on Wednesday and reverse happy hour....good local hangout...not too busy so you can get decent service and watch what you want. Plus really good all you can eat fish on Friday for ten bucks. Coolness. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Normally great fish on Friday fish fry. Unfortunately tonight the service was almost non existent. Even the manager who was waiting tables couldn't get a simple order right. Waited 10 minutes after \"seating ourselves\" and had to go to the bar to get a beer! Spoke to a couple on the way out that said they wouldn't seat their party even to get a drink because the kitchen was too backed up."}
{"text":"The worst service ever!  I went there tonight for dinner with my wife, son and parents.  The waiter forgot to put my wife's order in (it was a salad).  When our food came, we waited for the salad, or the waiter to surface, and neither did.  I asked two other employees to send our waiter over, and 5 minutes later (It wasn't busy either) a different waiter came by and asked what we needed.  We let him know that the salad hadn't come out, and it has now been 10 minutes since our food was delivered.  They let us know it would be out right away, and 10 minutes later we still hadn't seen it.    My parents and son ate their food, mine was now cold.  Finally we told them to keep the salad, and they could also keep my uneaten burger, and that I would not be paying for either.  They agreed and I left a 10% tip, which was 10% more than the waiter deserved.  Thank you for wasting 90 minutes of my night!  There are plenty of other local places like Azool's that will get my business in the future."}
{"text":"Looking for a decent neighborhood bar to have a beer and watch some sports? This is it. Looking for good food?  Not exactly their specialty here. I like Gallaghers for the Thursday night  trivia once in a while, but service can be spotty, wine glasses are sometimes dirty, they air conditioner feels like it's set at 80 degrees in the summer, and food is expensive and not that good for the price. I feel like they have you over a barrel because it's convenient for our neighborhood and the only sit down restaurant/bar nearby."}
{"text":"We read the recent reviews and decided to try this place anyway. We sat at the bar and immediately noticed the temperature of the bar area was a good 20 degrees hotter than just a few feet away. Yes, it was hot out that day and we wanted cold beer and a cool place. Bar was about half full and a few people were eating. I asked the guy next to me who was eating wings if they were good. He just rolled his eyes and said does it look good. No it didn't. Enough said. We finally figured why the bar area was so warm. The heat from the kitchen was being pulled right out to the bar! Really? Aren't there exhaust fans in your kitchen? We had one luke cold beer and left. Didn't want to chance the food."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while and tonight decided to drop in as I was craving a burger and a beer. The indoor bar area was full so I went and sat at the outdoor bar. I sat for 15 minutes and a server or bar tender never came outside. There were other patrons out there that had food and drinks so I wasn't alone. I got tired of waiting and went and sat in the off track betting area. The sign at the front had read 'seat yourself' so I didn't feel the need to go inform a hostess where I was sitting. Once again the section was totally ignored for around 15 minutes. At this point I was pissed off and didn't want to give them my service this evening. For that I can't rate any higher than 1 star since I wasn't even acknowledged. It'll probably be a while before I go back again. South Phoenix is in desperate need of another sports bar to compete with this place."}
{"text":"I come here to eat all the time. This place has good food good people especially the bartender by the name of adi."}
{"text":"Gallagher's on Carefree Highway and Black Mountain Parkway has a great new menu. Their Happy Hour from 3 to 7 has some really great priced food & drinks. I had 3 chicken street tacos for $5 and a glass of wine for $2 Friday. Looking forward to trying the other menu items. They have great Friday fish fry also! Nice place, Nice People!"}
{"text":"Very bad food and service. TV's are accessible and decent beer selection. Don't plan on eating or drinking a good selection of beers."}
{"text":"The wife and I were in for dinner and sat at the bar. The service was good and the bartender was attentive to us even with a full bar. The food was typical bar food. But the smoked ribs were awesome. We love the trivia and the energy from the bartender. You can tell he likes his job and was having fun. There needs to be more options for Happy Hour food. The boneless wings were a great recommendation But we would like to see other things included."}
{"text":"This location has benefited by the addition of a new manager named Rob. Since he started here, the level of service has risen to match the food which is excellent. Everything I have tried off the menu is at least 4 stars. Drink specials every day. Come in this weekend and see. Ask for Marci at the bar"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent this local bar very often as it is close to home and Happy Hour prices are nicely done..... Always great service.. we usually sit on the patio... great place to go and hang out for a few after work, or on a lazy weekend afternoon.....had the Mediterranean Wrap with Fresh steamed Veggies( don't laugh we're on a fitness program) it was very good for splitting and was fresh and pleasantly tasting... goes to prove you can find healthy food at a local bar lol..............  Been going here off and on for 12 years wont stop!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food outdoor patio live horserace betting lively crowd trivia games fun great atmosphere"}
{"text":"The wings were great and they carried local micro brew. Watched the giants beat the cards, and even better than that they had excellent service. My new go to sports bar!"}
{"text":"We came to town for an event and decided on Gallagher's for dinner.   Always looking for a local establishment and not a chain while visiting new places.   Atmosphere was of a good sports bar and grill with plenty of game choices on dozens of TVs.  Highlight was their food.   7 in our party and we ordered numerous things and everyone was happy with their choice.   I had the Big Ben Blue Cheese 1/2 pound burger and the flavoring and cooking was just right.   Well done.  If we are back in town we will come again."}
{"text":"Gallagher's is one of my favorite bars in the area.  I love places I can go get a few drinks, talk to (and hear!) my friends, and maybe play some pool or darts.  Gallagher's is nice and low-key, has friendly staff, and really good food.  Their chicken wings are great, and this is one of the few restaurants I've been to that offers pulled chicken, not just pulled pork!  Prices are totally reasonable, too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Even though it gets really packed the staff is very quick and always seem so happy. I love coming here for sports games. Highly recommend this establishment"}
{"text":"Okay Okay I'll admit it THIS WAS THE BEST BONELESS honey BBQ wings every. See you next week! Our server was fantastic! Didn't get name but she called us darlin' all the time. Very very good!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar with beers on tap & bazillion TV's & OTB. Addy behind the bar on Saturday's makes it all good"}
{"text":"The service we had was good, food was alright, the prices seemed high.  Just a sports bar.    Fine never going to again."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, I usually just have the wings, hot and they are very tasty. Service was pretty quick and server seemed nice.  Its always nice and fresh inside and there beer was cold.  I would reccomend this place to someone who just wants a relaxed sports bar.  most of the time ive gone its not too packed.    4**** stars!"}
{"text":"The staff is awesome! Friendly and keep the refills coming!! The wings are yummy and the other food is too!! The entertainment is fantastic."}
{"text":"A good burger and lots of screens for the sports fan.  Food is not terrific but staff is friendly, with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Terrible service!! Ordered drinks during happy hour that were watered down!  When we told the staff they told us to make it a double and we will charge you more!  What! Never again!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but the daytime service is so slow. There were only a couple of tables so she wasn't very busy. She may also take care of the bar but still the service was much too slow. If you need a quick daytime lunch do not come here. I would have given one star due to the slow service but the food was fine so two stars it is."}
{"text":"My only experience at Gallagher's was similar to the one described below by Glenn G.  Went there with a large group from work and found the service to be excellent.  Everyone enjoyed the food.  Rarely do you have a large party (we had about 10) and request separate checks without getting attitude; but here they were happy to do so.  Based on this visit I would recommend Gallagher's."}
{"text":"Unfortunately Yelp requires at least one star so to leave a review I was required to provide one.  However, this Gallagher's does not warrant any stars.  My husband I came with our sister/brother-in-law and their kids who are regulars here (they raved about the boneless wings and bloody marys, but warned of the service).  As we were not in a huge hurry I wasn't terribly worried.  SInce it was Saturday and the place was basically emply I thought \"how bad could it be?\"  My sister-in-law ordered 3 happy wings and 2 kid's meals to start.  Hailey, our waitress, asked if she wanted 6 or 12.  Perplexed my sister-in-law said how they usually come - 12.   We ordered a few beers, mimosas, iced tea and the kids ordered soda ($2.50 each for kids, not included with a kid's meal!).   In hindsight my sister-in-law said that the kid's melas do come with a drink, but I didn't know.  Our drinks arrived, but I should note that we were never offered refills on any of our drinks including the free refills - my brother-in-law had to ask for a tea refill twice.  It was NEVER proactively offered!  This in itself certainly doesn't warrant giving no stars, but it certainly contributes to the disaster.  When Hailey dropped off our drinks she asked what else we wanted to order and I wasn't ready so asked for a few minutes.  20 minutes later she came back (was nowhere in sight) and when I told her we were ready to order she said \"Finally?\"  OK?  My in-laws ordered a SW Chicken salad split and my husband and I ordered a small nacho with the onions, tomatoes and jalapenos on the side.  A few minutes later our wings arrived (if you were counting it has now been about 25 minutes for the wings to get here).  We was surprised the wings had bones in them & asked if they were on happy hour because they wanted the boneless wings.  She assured me they were.  Rather than refuse the bone-in wings most of our party started to eat them, but I refused and placed an order for boneless.   20+ minutes later the salad, half order of nachos and boneless wings arrived.  I noticed immediately the nachos were missing sour cream and told Hailey - she informed me they did not come with sour cream.  Unfortunately for her I can read and know it was on the menu - she then corrected herself and said that they usually drizzle it on, but since I asked for so much on the side they must have decided not to (WTF?).  Then my sister-in-law mentioned that the salad usually comes with bread and asked for that.  Did I mention that she didn't bring an extra plate for them to split the salad?  By now we are pretty annoyed especially when we realize that the wings that they expected to be $2.99 were now $.49 per wing (according to the happy hour advertisement on the TV screen).  Oh and the wings were rubbery and not good according to those that ate them.  There were over a dozen left out of 3 dozen.  When we got our check the wings were $25.47.  As my in-laws are regulars I decided to say something.  I expressed that we didn't want the bone-in wings and wasn't happy about the charge.  She asked me if I wanted her to talk to the manager.  Um, yes - that is what I brought it up Einstein.    5 minutes later she comes back and says that she spoke to the manager and since we basically ate the wings he would only take off one order (fair point, but absolutely terrible delivery).  And if we really wanted to talk to him she would get him and come over.  I was flabbergasted that the manager did not come over himself.  We said no, but then noticed that if the wings were $.49 we were still being overcharged - then she informed us that was only on Wednesday.    So... $72 dollars (plus a $9 tip I didn't even want to leave) later we left very unhappy.  I have already informed my in-laws that we will never return here, so when we are in town don't even try it.  The food was terrible and the service sucks.  Honestly the worst service I have ever had.  And I can't even imagine that Hailey is the only problem waitress - with an unresponsive manager I am sure that place is swamped with people who have no idea how to do their job.  You are way better off going across the street to Wendy's or honestly, anywhere but here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went on 08/30/2012 about 5:00pm food not good at all but the beer was very cold if you go just get beer The staff not bad"}
{"text":"Been here 3x hoping that it may have just been the time of day or server but ALL 3x we went the service was horrible, bathrooms unusable and food just gross.  On our final visit both my wife and I were sick the rest of the night.  Approach with caution... you have been warned!!"}
{"text":"Great choices of food. Also Great food. Good service for the most part. We are weekly regulars here. And their white chocolate chip macadamia nut cookie and ice cream is one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Gallaghers is like most sports bars, bar food and beer! This is the type of place you come to hang out after work. Lots of regulars. Food is good for a sports bar, better than chain restaurants for sure!"}
{"text":"\"Meh,\" is exactly how I'd put it. Friendly staff, but the food isnt' all that great. Everything is processed, as are most food establishments, but the chicken seems like it was taken out of a bag, microwaved and served. My coworkers seem to like the fish 'n chips, which I have yet to try. The fries are alright, nothing spectacular. I guess it would be a fun place though just to relax at lunch or after work - it's a sports grill, but the food just isn't up there with me."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered a salad with steak on it.  The steak was blah and there was hardley any of it on the salad.  I took two bites and couldn't eat anymore.  So I ordered the chicken cesear salad...that was the most bland salad I've ever had. You know how there's supposed to be that slight twang of lemon there was none.  The chicken was so bland and chewy it was very difficult to eat.  There was no seasoning on the chicken whatsoever.  I'm thinking it was some left over chicken from somewhere.  Needless to say I left there hungry.    My lesson learned...when you go to a bar, order bar food.  You should have better luck with the wings."}
{"text":"I can see why the stars are falling. Clearly, overlooked fish, but plated it.  Fail Sauce."}
{"text":"Good prices and good food. Lots of specials on drinks, or at least whenever I happen to go. Friendly staff. Decent amount of draft beers"}
{"text":"This is a neighbor hood bar that I only can see one coming to if one lives right by. There is nothing I consider redeeming by this place. They have beer, they have standard grub and standard everything else. Nothing to yelp about ;) It's almost as if they went out of their way to maintain anonymousy if it wasn't the gloom atmosphere with a hint of depression and melancholy.   I don't thing that Gallaghers has a format that is desirable, at least not for me. I have other establishments to force my taxed monies upon.  I had some great company, but I can't credit the establishment for that. I cannot see it in the stars that I will return, to this or another namesake establishment.   They do have trivia. If anyone is into that, but they won't deserve my mercy because of it.   .. und das ist nach ein enttäuscht kritiker"}
{"text":"Slow service, items on their reverse happy hour menu online are outdated and they no longer honor them, and can't review food because it took too long for our order to come out so we left. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came in at 2 PM for late lunch - place wasn't busy at all. Looked around and the bowl game I wanted to watch wasn't on so I asked the server if they could change the channel. She said she would ask the manager - she asked him 3 times over the course of 45 minutes and he never came over to our table. We watched him talk to his regulars and avoid us - maybe he was too incompetent to change the channel so he was embarrassed? Our server did a great job - very attentive and made sure our orders were correct. But this manager should realize if he wants to build his client base he should attempt to make an effort."}
{"text":"As long as Stephanie is working the bar the customer service is great! Wings and beer on Thursday is great"}
{"text":"Great beer and decent service. That's the end of it. If you're going for happy hour I'm sure you'll be pleased. If you want food, RUN!   Gallagher's has been the only decent bar/restaurant in the area (besides Amano's, which is excellent but a bit pricey). They used to have good (not great) bar food, but apparently being the only game in the Baseline corridor has softened them. Their burgers were - were - above average. I'm very picky, if you won't serve it medium rare or less I won't bother. But they've gone waaaaay downhill. Now if I order a burger, it will either be well well done or blue rare. Horrible. So I switched to chicken since that's usually...chicken. This evening, I went for takeout, a buffalo salad (quite tasty) and a bourbon swiss chicken burger. They brought me a guacamole burger (though at least it was chicken). Can't eat tomatoes so I returned it. Thank goodness I checked it! Re-ordered the bourbon Swiss burger, received it promptly (good), took it home, sliced it in half, and beheld the pink hue before me (BAD!). It's hilarious that I can't get a medium rare burger, but I can get medium rare chicken! Of course now I'm at home so I guess my dinner is fries. Thanks, Gallagher's. Thanks.  ** I wrote that review 3 weeks ago on my phone, but reviews don't upload until you log in on an actual computer (BTW Yelp, I wish you'd change that). Anyway, tonight I was out of options, being in South Phoenix. Well, to be fair I did have fast food options (which I should have exercised, stupid me). Since I had nowhere to go but Gallagher's, I decided I would just get something deep fried and hope for the best, since it's pretty easy to make deep fried food. Silly me.   I asked for the Monterrey chicken sandwich. Again, I will note that back in the day, this used to be delicious. Now it's an overcooked (ironic, considering my issue a few weeks ago) slab of chicken on a bun. It's supposed to come with cheese, black olves, and ranch dressing. Personally, I think warm ranch dressing is really gross (as is warm mayonnaise, eww) so I asked for ranch on the side. Lo and behold, the sandwich doesn't just have ranch. the bun is literally drenched, it's soggy and disintegrating in the ranch. I'm so diappointed and angry with Gallagher's. It's my own fault for ordering food to go instead of waiting there and sending it back 10 times. Live and learn.   BTW, yes, my dinner is fries again. I hate you Gallaghers. I hate you. HATE YOU."}
{"text":"Good food but initial service is slow.   Most of the times we go for lunch it is \"seat yourself.\"  It often takes 5 to 10 minutes before a waiter/waitress brings you a menu. Once the process starts the service is very good."}
{"text":"We had the Cobb Salad and Steak salad last night. While my Cobb was great, the flavor from the cut of meat was Excellent. Next time it will be two Steak Salads..."}
{"text":"First time here.  Sat for 20 minutes before asking for our order.  After which took 40 minutes to get our food and it was cold and for bar food/sports bar my buffalo chicken sandwich was very lacking in flavor and ranch was watered down.  Never even  got asked if our food was ok like standard waitresses do at the beginning of your meal.We should have looked on Yelp first and gotten a sign when Filibertos has more stars than a Gallaghers"}
{"text":"Considering there is an extreme lack of food options here in \"The Creek\" - Gallagher's definitely meets the need for: 1 - ICE COLD Beer 2 - Quick / Casual Food  I'd prefer more food options outside of the 'chain restaurant' category.  But I will happy go to Gallagher's any night of the week if it means an ICE COLD beer, the ability to wear whatever it is that I am already wearing, and a great selection of meal options (many are standard chain options - but  there are some extra choices as well).  Did I mention ICE COLD beer - reason alone to go. The only draw back - and this is bizarre - they don't have a beer list.  You have to go up to the bar to look at the taps.  Many of the wait staff have created their own cheat sheet which I find very admirable.   Not sure why the manager has yet to create one himself.  I am a sucker for that silly quiz game - the one where you get the box from the bar and compete against other bars around the country - that is a definite bonus.  TVs Galore!  Any game, any time, any where - you can certainly see it at Gallagher's.  They have pool tables and not sure what else - I haven't ventured into that corner of the place.  There is outdoor seating - with plenty of TVs as well - and the set up is pretty cool - they made it so that you don't feel like you are in the middle of a strip mall parking lot (even though you are.)  Great seating options for groups and families - and they are easily split - when you walk in - the seating to the right is more family oriented - and the seating to the left is more group and 'older crowd' oriented..  They even have those fabulous chocolate mints at the host stand!  Just remember to ask your server if they have a beer list - and enjoy."}
{"text":"Solid sports bar always delivering nice chilled glasses with beer and pretty solid bar food. Sometimes it's good sometimes it pretty bad. I like all of the tv's everywhere and like the boneless wings. Not the best happy hour but better than nothing. I like the back patio with the waterfalls. This place gets packed in the winter. It could use some games like shuffleboard, pool or darts but there's not enough room I guess?  I like some of the bartenders there but the staff can be a bit darrison at times. Sometimes they are too friendly with each other. Sometimes they are a bit careless and not as clean as they should be.   I haven't had a horrible experience yet, usually have a great time. I will continue to go here."}
{"text":"came here last night and service was so slow but the place was empty.  the nachos are the ballpark cheesy kind.  i prefer the shredded cheese type on my nachos.  the wings- good. again, just come here for wings and you may have to wait for the waitress to come over for a long long time."}
{"text":"Staff wasn't all that excited to be staff. I guess it's a Phoenix thing but my dollars spend the same in every state so that's no excuse in my mind. Fish fry isn't beer battered cod loins, it's corn meal battered filets. Kind of unexpected. But the beer was cold and the waffle fries were delicious. The live music was nice."}
{"text":"it is the worst place starting with the service as much as the one in charge of the restauran very bad way of attending or solving a problem nothing friendly was dirty the table took 45 minutes to take our order"}
{"text":"Every time I think of giving this place a try, I am disappointed. The wait staff is glacially slow. The food would be all right, if it didn't sit under the lights quite so long. I sat at the bar tonight, hoping to get out of there in a reasonable amount of time, and was treated like a second class citizen. I waited and waited for my mediocre meal, (fish tacos, not worth the money) which were overdone. and cold, except for the cabbage, which was warm from being under the light. People who, I guess are regulars, got served instantly. They were chatted with, checked back on, etc. Their food arrived steaming hot, very quickly. They were asked how they were doing, etc. I had to wait and wait and wait for the bartender to do her job. She acted like she was just tolerating my unwelcome presence. I asked for my check, and had to wait some more while she waited on the other few people at the bar. The place was fairly dead. My time was wasted, and I ended up swearing never to go back there again. By the way, never, ever order a mixed drink here. Trust me, they can't mix to save their lives. (I was a bartender on the Strip in Vegas at one time). I've done every job in the restaurant business at one time or another, and I know how things are supposed to run. They have some good recipes, but the staff needs real training, management and some standards."}
{"text":"This place is okay, as far as bar food goes. Lots of TVs, OTB and juke box. For happy hour, we ordered Jake's boneless wings and 1 dozen GOAT wings. The boneless wings were dry as toast. GOAT wings were pretty decent.   Wait staff courteous and prompt."}
{"text":"The only reason the stars are so low is because all the regulars who come here don't think to use an app to post how great it is, and of course the people who have a bad time can't wait to blast the company. I've been coming here for a while and have never had any problems. Lindsay has always real and gives me great service, definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Just found out they aren't doing heaters on the patio this year?!?! WTF They promote Friday live music and DJ but without heaters, no way....I was just here on Thursday for trivia and there were 6 people outside and the inside was crammed because they don't have heaters!!! Dumb I'm dropping to 2 stars until they fix this!!  ----------------   Been coming here off and on for a long time, this is a great place. Despite the reviews the servers are very personal and get to know you. They learn your name and are super friendly. The breakfast menu is good but I love the new menu tons of great things for everyone. I had the pizza flatbread and cheese curds. They have tons of beers on tap, slot of local brews as well.  They have the most tvs I've seen in a long time and the layout is great.   I'm a karaoke fan and coming on a Saturday night was a blast!!"}
{"text":"I've lived nearby for a decade and come in a few times a year. The food and service has always been excellent until recently.   It had been a few months since we came in and the menus have changed. We started with the chips and guacamole. Guacamole is pretty hard to screw up, but they managed to do it. Completely bland. Just avocado and tomato. No cilantro. No onion. No Serrano peppers. No garlic. No lime juice. No salt and pepper. So disappointing.   I ordered the green Chile Mac and cheese. Again - completely bland. Cheese sauce bland and not enough green chiles. Had to salt and pepper the crap out of it.   My husband got the Philly Cheesesteak. Again, completely bland. He didn't even finish  his plate.   It was pretty dead for a Saturday night and our waiter was terrible. We waited over 15 min to order our food and it only happened when I walked up to the bartender and complained that we hadn't seen our waiter. When he finally showed up, it seemed like we were an inconvenience and interrupting his night. All I can think is that they got a new cook and management has no taste buds or eyes to see what's going on.   We'll probably give it one more shot but if things aren't better I can't imagine we'll be back."}
{"text":"Yes definately go on Wednesdays to enjoy their $.40 wins and do ask for them to be charbroiled.....very goooood! Garlic hot and habanero hot! Will be there every wednesday from now on!"}
{"text":"Just had some of the best service.  The food was basic bar fare but George our waiter made for a great night out!  He greeted us with a big smile and made sure we had everything we need.  George is the reason we will be coming back.  Great Job!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed we went to watch horse race and they only have the tiny screen we asked if the three screens in inside the area that  have otb could be changed to horse racing be cause we couldn't see the screens the said it wasn't on the same feed. We wouldn't even come here but there isn't any closer place to bet horse racing in South Phoenix.Ps waiters did try to hel its. Management. Well The waiters manged to get Tvg on for us have to say that made things better and the food was great Thanks George"}
{"text":"This place was great. Our bartender Shannon was fantastic. The atmosphere was very friendly. The only thing that I have was disappointed about was that they got rid of the queso dip."}
{"text":"We go to Gallaghers every week for the wings! The raspberry chipotle wings are amazing! Try them with the sweet potato fries! The Hot is a great buffalo sauce ! Try them with the jalapeño burger!!"}
{"text":"Great hang out spot in Phoenix!    Staff is amazing and I will definitly come back next time in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"We love this place after enough times driving past finally stopped in and it was so good I'm a vegetarian and it's hard to find restaurants that accommodate drinks are good service has always been great and I often find myself craving the food."}
{"text":"this place has lousy service and the food is terrible if you get lunch or dinner. we went for brunch twice and they make a very decent breakfast. the service in the am is also not bad just not as friendly as you would like. their breakfast is one of the better ones in the limited variety of restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Gwen is the number 1  bartender in phoenix ! Love her does a great job ! Beautiful woman also ask for her to serve you ! Any questions call me Aka sexy chocolate love you mrs Gwen!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great. We got the mozzarella sticks, buffalo chicken wrap and some shots. Service was quick and the seating outside next to the waterfall was great."}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for the last ten years  and regularly came in for dinner and brunch.   I like to frequent the local restaurants because I want to do my part to keep them in business.   That being said, I'm moving on.    The new menu for dinner is a complete disappointment.    Gone are the best food items they had, and everything has been replaced with basic bar food.  We decided to truly the pulled pork sandwich and a Cubano, and I can honestly say they are no longer even competition for Applebee's.     I can only hope that a new restaurant comes into the neighborhood so I don't have to travel to Tempe for a decent meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in North Phoenix. There are tons of TVs, perfect for football season if you want to watch multiple games. There is an OTB, not really my thing, but pretty cool anyhow. There are pool tables and dart boards and a little claw machine! The restaurant is very open. There are places to sit at tables or booths, a bar off to the left and nice seating on the patio.   The best part, though, the food. I frickin love their food. So many great things to choose from and they have a large menu selection. Some of my favorites are the pulled pork sandwich, nachos (they make their own cheese sauce) and the burgers. My absolute favorite is the bacon cheese fries (sub seasoned waffle fries for regular). You are in a serious carb coma after eating them, but whatevs, they are too good to even care.   The staff is always consistently friendly and on point. I really do love it here and am super happy it's so close to home!"}
{"text":"We've been meeting friends there once a month since last February - and we're thinking of going somewhere else from now on. They've removed a lot of items from the menu and the prices have seriously gone up. None of us ordered a burger on this visit, but I wouldn't be surprised if they're now using frozen patties instead of the handmade burgers that they used to serve. I say that because everything - and I mean everything - on our plates very obviously came pre-packaged from a factory (including the pulled pork that they used to smoke on site) and just warmed up and assembled there.  I think they probably fired the cook and now just have someone who tends the microwave. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Wasn't quite sure what was wrong with the service today. Went there for St. Patrick's Day and got in right away. They sent us is the betting/gaming section. The lights were incredibly bright there so we asked if they could be turned down like the rest of the restaurant. But they said they could not do it. I figured it was because of the betting  going on. We ordered wings and they were pretty good but for some reason when we ordered steamed vegetables we ended up with two baggies full of steamed vegetables stuffed into a small jar. Definitely not a way to serve steamed vegetables. It was borderline disgusting. Also I ordered Guinness which is typical to order on St. Patrick's Day. I got a plastic cup with my Guinness in it."}
{"text":"Kinda of a rough and tumble crowd at times with the OTB booth in the back corner of the bar. Place is usually crowded after work with the blue collar drinking types and unless your a regular you will probably get ignored like I did on a previous visit. In this case, finally tried the food and it was surprisingly good. The waitress said that the buffalo wrap was good, so I went with grilled chicken tossed in mild wing sauce and that went into my wrap with the usual cheese, lettuce, some blue cheese and maybe a touch of bacon? THe wrap was huge and the chicken and blue cheese melded perfectly together. On the side dish selection wheel, I went with sweet potato fries - this was a decent version of that variety, but the raspberry sauce? served as a dipping option was a fail. Great service on a saturday afternoon and reasonable prices ($8.99) for a filling lunch."}
{"text":"I gave one star cause the Wings's are amazing went to watch the packers and bears  game I sat my self tho it was pretty packed I waited 10 minutes no one came to take my order get me a water or even to say hi ... this has happen before I'm over it my money is good as anyone else"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there today.  I had a draught beer and a \"Mini G burger\" plate (sliders). My wife ordered a egg and bacon croissant. The sliders were OK, nothing to get excited about, but not bad.  My wife really enjoyed her sandwich.  The beer was served cold, not frosty, but OK.  We would have stayed longer, and probably doubled our bill, except for a very loud, annoying table behind us that kept yelling and clapping. (sunday football games were on the multiple TVs)  I understand fan's excitement, we were there to watch football , just like most of the other customers, but this particular table could be heard all through the place.  They made the experience so bad that we left and went to another establishment to watch the rest of the game and have a few drinks. Service was OK at best.  Lots of tables, not so many servers....seemed like they were unorganized."}
{"text":"Mid August I hosted by husband's birthday happy hour at Gallagher's. Things we great in the beginning. Our reserved table was ready and waiting for us and we had two wait staff moving throughout our group. I was very pleased with my decision to hold it there. As the evening wore on we rarely had service and our guests were ordering from both the happy hour menu and the regular menu; they would have earned quite a nice tip if the service hadn't fallen off. For about our last hour and a half we had to beg for service. We'd flag a waiter down to order then have to beg 30 minutes later to get what we ordered. It was embarrassing for my guests to be treated like this.  When we were ready to go we had go find a waitress to ask for the bill (even though most of the party had departed because they were tired of waiting); that took a while to get. Once we had the bill my father-in-law pointed out to me a gratuity was included in the bill because the size of the party and that was fine. I wasn't please with the service but I still would have left a tip. We put the cash in the bill folder that had been left by departed guests, my father-in-law and I added our credit cards, and then asked the waitress (when she eventually came by again) to deduct the cash and split the bill in two.   When we got our slips to sign my father-in-law told me not to add a gratuity because he would add more even though there was an included gratuity. I wrote 0 in the tip and wrote the total on the total line.  Fast forward to me doing bills... someone at Gallagher's decided to add their own additional $15 tip on my receipt. This is NOT okay! I realize a big party is tough but the service was terrible and they had already included and included gratuity and my father-in-law added more.   Even though it is a convenient location with decent bar food I WILL NOT GO BACK!"}
{"text":"Can't say this was the greatest place to eat. The waiters was also the bartender and also the person for everyone to have a conversation with in the back. Waited and waited for food ordering and drink ordering. Food came out cold and dry. I ordered the parmesan wings and got dried out something?"}
{"text":"Ate here a while ago. Service was always good for us. something happened that made me not want to ever eat there again. The family and I went for lunch and we sat in a corner booth. As soon as I sat down I accidentally hit some type of device that was on the floor against the wall. First thing I though was someone dropped their cellphone. Well, it wasn't a cellphone. It was a roach motel. It was a roach trap with a roach inside that was still alive. I could not believe they had a roach trap under my seat. That alone made me think how many more roaches are hanging out in the rest of the restaurant or in the kitchen. We loved eating there because they had decent food. But no thanks, don't feel like eating roach salad. Hopefully they get things cleaned up."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. I came here on New Year's Eve with a date. The fact that there was hardly anyone here should have been my first clue. In fact, a one is too high of a score. Our server was very inattentive. Had to make several trips to fulfill our order. The prime rib was cold.  The potato like warm and the butter hard, we had to ask several times for the tv channel to be changed to the New Years ball dropping... I could go on and on... this is not a good place."}
{"text":"We went the evening of my little sister's 21st birthday to get shots to start the night out. She had never had alcohol and was excited to try her first shot. However, the waitress, Amy, was completely RUDE to us! After looking at my sister's ID, went to get a waiver for her to sign because her ID was, of course, still strait up and down. She laid it on the table and said in her snotty tone: \"Be prepared, you're gonna be filling out A LOT of these tonight!\" The only other words she communicated to us were rude, as well. Of course, the rest of the night, we didn't sign one single waiver. We told Amy we just wanted the two shots and then we'd like the check, but she didn't come back for another twenty minutes after giving us the shots! WE had to flag her down to get her to finally come back to the table, and the place wasn't busy at all. My fiancé and I had been to this Gallagher's many times before and loved it, but Amy ruined our experience and we won't be coming back.   We came in smiling and she totally killed the mood."}
{"text":"First off, I want to say the two waitresses that served us were awesome, prompt, and very respectful.  That is where it ends for me as I exit the establishment.  I have been coming to this place for over four years and have never encountered raw food or  baby roaches.  The waitress immediately took the food back and had to cooks put them back in the oven and called the manager, who by the way was not on the premises at all.  When she was finally about to get in touch with him, he did show up.  He shows up in shorts and a t-shirt like he doesn't have a care on the world.  Now I'm willing to accept that it may be his day off so maybe he just came in to resolve the issue.  What I don't like is when anyone tries to undermine my intelligence like he did.  I cook and smoke various meats all the time and I know what raw or undercooked chicken looks like.  When they brought the wings back out after putting them back in the oven, they still were not cooked fully.  To tell me that they cook the wings for three hours before they are served and then they cooked them again to order before they give them to customers is ABSOLUTELY crap.  To not even address the the fact that there was a baby roach on one of the plates was even worse.  Then you has the audacity to charge us for them.  I am so disappointed in the fact that this is the type of manager that apparently  thinks that this is ok.  I would like to say that the other food was great but I will never go here again.  I never have had this type of service from this site before and best believe I will not ever again, can you say food inspectors and board of health need to drop by soon!!!"}
{"text":"Props when props are due. Being someone that has worked within the service industry for years to pay for school, I pay attention to service staff and I only have good things to say about this place. Staff were awesome when I just needed a place to hang out for a few hours and relax after a bad day. Special shout out to my server Colton who was friendly, courteous, and made the experience hassle free. Better than most of the servers I've worked with. I got some ciders and chips & guac and have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible.  Took the whole family (all 6 of us) and everyone ordered something different.  Nobody said they wanted to come back, myself included."}
{"text":"I have visited Gallagher's a couple of times.  The last time I went, I ordered the hot wings (happy hour) and they were GREAT!!!  Just like I like them.  The only reason why I did not give this place a 5 star is because when ordering drinks, they were completely out of what I normally drink, which would have made Happy Hour greater. Since they did not have my drink, I ended up having to order something much more expensive.  I believe that you should never run out of a beverage that you have on the happy list.  Nevertheless, I love the fact that you can sit inside or outside.  I can't wait to try the other food on the menu, but I may have to stick with the draft beer during happy hour instead of ordering my normal alcohol drink."}
{"text":"The beer is ice cold. The food is good bar food with low prices during happy hour which starts at 11am. The one- in my opinion is the fact that it is very very loud. It is tough to have a conversation with a friend. The building is not acoustically sound. They have plenty of televisions but the sound is never on. They're always playing rock music when I've been there"}
{"text":"Stopped by with a few coworkers last night after work. Good sports bar. Service was average and so was the food. We tried the shrimp tacos (decent), mini burgers (below average), and the fish and chips (average). Eh."}
{"text":"Awesome place Shannon is great food is great and the bathrooms are clean will always resolve a issue if u have one"}
{"text":"Not even worth 1 star. Management is extremely rude and completely negligent to their customers. I even overheard a manager (found out her name was Rachel) speak to the staff in a complete unprofessional manner. Not to mention she was cussing at them and treating them as if they were her servants. Food is awful and always inconsistent. I know the guy Steve who used to ''own'' the chain and he is the biggest idiot, ignorant, and rudest person I've ever had the painful memory of meeting. Don't waste your time there, there are so many other BETTER places to go and get a cold beer and watch some sports!"}
{"text":"Ghost chili wings are out of this world here if you can truly handle hot food!!! A casual sports bar atmosphere and with TV's everywhere and a pretty decent patio this place is a great happy hour spot. Just be sure to wash your hands after eating the ghost chili wings and don't rub your eyes!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, had to wait an hour for the food to get to our table, place was not busy at all, when food got there it look old food was almost cold like it was sitting for a long time, waitress by the name Alicia keep forgetting things that we order, even to get a glass of water took 20 min, service and look of this place had change, looks run down, won't be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Love it here. Lindsay is the best bartender. Connor is an amazing server and so is Gabby. The drinks are well above average and the food is pretty good too. As a regular, I can attest to the greatness."}
{"text":"We like this place for the Packers games and morning specials during the football season.  Food is decent, although I think they changed chefs, as some things have changed a bit from the fall.    They have some beer on tap and usually good domestic specials.  Plus, they're on the Western Canal, so you could walk or bike home if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times now, based on the fact the my friend lives right down the street and there is no other place to go.  This is not a destination place for us, just a place to get out of the house and have a drink.  It's a sports bar with bar food.  The appetizers are pretty decent, but I had the chicken fried steak and it was inedible.  You know it's bad when your fork bends when you're trying to cut through the steak.  The best part of Gallagher's is that they have many tv's and it u want to watch several games at once, you can."}
{"text":"Our apartment complex had catering from Gallaghers and I really enjoyed the chicken bacon ranch wraps! Very delicious! The wings were a little on the mushy and fatty side, could've been fried and crisped up a bit more, but otherwise we were very pleased."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Gwen and Corey are a force to be reckoned with.  An awesome team that kicks ass every time were here.  Great service.  Always get the boneless wings.  Try the g.o.a.t wings too.  Badass.  Lots on good food to pick from."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, and I will continue to go (due to lack of other sports bar options in the area), but this place just is not that great though it has the potential.    The few times I have been there, there have always been problems with the food - and I mean service issues, not quality issues - which leads me to believe the management could use a little makeover.  I have had cold wings served (I mean cold, not just not hot).  Wings take over 30 minutes (at which point they were canceled).  The food is fairly decent though, for bar food.  Nothing I crave, but something that will get me by during a big game.  Last night I went in to watch the ASU/UA football game and they had the sound on for the Cleveland/Heat game.  Really??  Do you know what state your bar is in?  Did you happen to notice that half the people there were wearing ASU or UA gear?  Apparently the manager wanted to hear the starting lineup.  I can kind of get that - I had curiosity around the game too - but if you want to see that, then tune into Sportscenter AFTER the ASU/UA game.  After the starting lineup was announced, and about 15 minutes in the football game, they changed the sound which was greeted by loud applause in the bar.  Little things like that make me believe the management is not in tune with the wants of their patrons.  They do have PLENTY of TV's to watch games and accommodate requests for game changes."}
{"text":"Friendliest Service (Vanessa), Fast Beer Refills (Lindsey), no nonsense management with complementary piggy back rides all night (JAKE!)"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Gallagher's sports bar off and on for years and have always had a good experience and tasty food.  Some of these reviews were awful and I can't see why.  They must have come on a very bad day or are just too picky.  This is a fun sports bar with a million TVs playing various sports, fun chatty waitresses and it can get noisy.  It is supposed to be noisy in a Sports Bar, no?   Shannon the bartender is just the coolest, fun, easy going person and always gives great service!  My food has always been fantastic.  I have had nachos, chicken cordon bleu sandwiches, chicken fingers, and a number of different burgers that were all cooked well and delicious.  I also love their small cut, crispy french fries.  All paired with a cocktail or an ice-cold beer and it is always a great lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I've ate here many many times because I fell in love with the boneless wings! The service is super friendly and the restaurant is always clean. The only con that just recently came up is that they changed their happy hour so now I won't be coming for lunch as often. Love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great place with many TVs to want the games.  Friendly staff and good happy hour menu.  Food and drink come quickly."}
{"text":"I love my girl KAITLIN!  She's always on top of everything!  She can read my mind!  She takes care of us girls!  She knows who we are...she \"rocks\" pours better than anyone!!!  Love you Kaitlin!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for some off track betting and must say the service was horrible! Took 30 minutes to get our 1st drink order. From that point on everything we ordered was incorrect. Asked for 2 waters and only got 1. Then had to ask for the 2nd water 2 more times before it actually arrived. Ordered bloody Mary's with salt came back with no salt. Ordered vodka soda with lemon came back with lime. Asked for ketchup gave us an empty bottle. I will say the server was nice enough but just very overwhelmed and it made our experience horrible. The food also took over an hour to finally make it's way to us long after the race was over. The food was ok but the overall experience was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I just want to thank the manager for honoring his word and taking the 2 extra pieces of cake they charged me for. I do want warn everyone this establishment charges by the slice when it comes to cake and probably everything else. My final bill was 88 dollars for one cake."}
{"text":"Service was bad, food was worse.   I'm almost certain the grilled chicken and buffalo chicken were just old frozen product.   My chicken had hard spots that were inedible.   The hamburger was extremely dry.   We waited almost 20 minutes before anyone even said hello or brought us drinks.   This placed used to be ok but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Been going here for at least 4 years with previous great service. Always had chicken fried steak with grilled asparagus, great meal. However, been away for 6 months and the place fell apart. When we entered about 20% of the tables were not bussed, dirty plates and food laying around. Our table was void of debris but when I sat down it was sticky, obviously not cleaned. I was told no more asparagus, too expensive and no green beans either. Got sweet fries that we didn't order followed by raw meat and frozen potatoes. We got a bill for stuff we didn't order. The waitress said there had been a lot of changes in the last 6 months,yuk. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Wow!! Stay away from this place unless you like being ignored by the Wait staff and have 45 min to wait for Appetizers. Thought I'd give another try, first visit last year was very slow service. Stopped in for Happy Hour after a Spring Training Game for Beers & Appetizers. Waitress didn't inform us of the Happy Hour, we happen to notice it on the table tent on table. Took FORVER to get our drinks and food never came. Finally after 45 min we asked for the bill and canceled the order. Super RUDE, LAZY and Manager didn't care upset customers were leaving unhappy. Not a Discount on the drinks, no I'm sorry vouchers to make sure we came back... NOTHING!! Place was not busy either. I'll never be back.... I'd rather get drinks & Hot Dogs at the nearby Circle K then to ever give this place my money!"}
{"text":"The owner was there and was extremely snobby. The wait staff is awful. Food was gross. And mostly... the clientele was disgusting. Nothing but drunk old men making any girl feel super uncomfortable with the constant stares. Gross."}
{"text":"It's right down the street from home for several of us, so we come pretty often. I'm usually satisfied with the food, burgers or other sandwiches for the most part. Because there are smokers in our party we are usually on the patio. After the outside bar closes (around 9pm?) the service on the patio is hit or miss."}
{"text":"First time at Gallaghers. Arrived for Monday Night Football and it was 1/2 full. We ordered nachos, which were okay but the salsa was disappointing. More jarred taste than made-in-the-kitchen taste.   I ordered Bill's Blue Cheese Burger and a beer.  The burgers here are big, so I had trouble finishing but it was a good meal. The side of Bleu Cheese was very runny though.   All told, we ordered one burger, one wrap, two baked potatoes and 8 drinks plus nachos for $76 plus tip. Pretty High for bar food. The entrées  were ample but the sides were sparse.   Service was great. Lindsay was efficient, followed through with special requests and checked in on us appropriately.   I wasn't overwhelmed but I'll probably try Gallagher's again."}
{"text":"This is a great local hangout and happy hour place. My friends and I came here twice because of the great deals.  On our first night, we wanted to watch the Sharks game but they don't have the channel on their dish. Oh well. For dinner, I had the sesame chicken salad and a Loaded Baker, which is a baked potato with sour cream, butter, diced bacon, cheddar cheese and diced green onions. Both were satisfying. I forgot what my friends got, but both liked what they had. Since we came during happy hour, you pay $2.50 for large domestic drafts, so the Coors Lights came to our table in waves. Then we found out that it was Trivia Night, which we were excited about. AND WE WON! We beat another table by 1 question (What president preceded Andrew Johnson?) and the answer was just guess (Abe Lincoln). LOL The prize was a $50 gift certificate which we used for our bill.  We came here again the next day and got the $2.50 large Coors Lights and the $2.95 boneless wings. My friend and I split an order of twelve because he likes his wings spicy and I don't. I wanted mine with honey bbq. They messed up the order (all 12 were spicy) and gave me six with no extra charge. We did have dinner here again and once again, I thought the food (Southwestern burger) was great. If you stay long again, you can catch reverse happy hour.  Also if you like horse or dog track racing, you can place your bets here. They have dedicated tv screens for that. Those dogs look so sad though."}
{"text":"Great attentiveness from the staff, friendly, chatty, positive attitude,  and overall welcoming and inviting. The gal behind the bar was 110%. I hate going to bars to enjoy spending my money and having the barmaid or man, treat you like shit for asking for a drink. This place is the opposite. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in late night. Bartender was very nice, poured a good drink which I always appreciate. Price was fair.  They do have a full kitchen, I did not eat.  I did enjoy the smoking patio which I was able to take my cocktail with me, bonus!  They have OTB if you like that kind of stuff. I tend to gamble with my life, not my money ;) Not a bad neighborhood spot!  You can trust me, I'm in the business ;D"}
{"text":"The food is bland, no seasoning on anything. The mixed drinks are weak. Keep driving til you find something better"}
{"text":"We met some friends here for dinner and to watch the Badger game.  Colton was our waiter and he was awesome.  Great job and personality. When reviewing the bill we saw that my friend had ordered a scotch and water.  There was no ice in the drink so she asked for a small glass of ice for her drink.  They charged her for the ice.  It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.  I will think twice about ever going there again."}
{"text":"One star cuz they had alcohol. Food was Absolutley awful after waiting 45 mins. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Go there once a week for a late lunch. They have awesome specials and a new happy hour that can't be beat. Food is good, bartenders and servers are good. Jessica is the best! She has an unbelievable personality and knows just how to deal with anyone she is serving. She turns the eating experience into a fun social visit. She makes sure you are leaving with a smile on your face.  The atmosphere is wonderful. You get your choice of sitting outside on the patio, in the dining room, at the bar, or even back by the off track betting. If you choose to watch the tvs you have them available everywhere."}
{"text":"I have been to Gallagher's in the past.  Same problem tonight.  No to get our beverages No one to take our order.  As I watched others get up for service also.  Don't think I will ever try them again."}
{"text":"Food was burnt, worst service, I can't believe this place is around. It's alway empty and they can't seem to get it together. Such a bummer since it's so close by."}
{"text":"Went here twice this past weekend, the food was good and the patio is really cool. The downside was the service... Servers seem uninterested in working.. Both times this weekend we were met with looooong gaps in between server interactions. Took over 5 minutes to get drinks and once we got drinks it was 15 minutes (finishing our beers) before the waiter even came back to take our food order.. saw him go greet a couple new tables in the mean time (Restaurant was probably 30% full.. no excuse for the time frames).. Not impressed.. There is zero sense of urgency with the staff... But at the end of the day this is probably one of the only spots open late in cave creek, so just gotta deal with the bad service! I am pretty sure a family member of one of the staff was having a gathering, since multiple servers were hovering to the corner of the place at that table while ignoring the rest of the customers.   However the food was pretty good, I had the wings (boneless) with hot sauce, i would get them again.   Also had a blue cheese burger, asked for it medium, seemed closer to rare, but i was hungry and did not feel like sending it back. Normally its the other way around so at least they didn't hockey puck it!  All in all, i would come back.. but not set my expectations high for getting actual service.. they were nice people.. but just painfully slow."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. A pleasure to see Wendy behind the bar. Fantastic service, always a smile."}
{"text":"Not bad.  You get bar food but I think you expect that going in.  Nice enough ambiance for lunch.  Great service.  The veggie burger was edible.  The sweet poatoes were edible.  The green tea was good.  I will go again since I live so close by."}
{"text":"Waiter tried,  but service was 1hr til we got food,  Luke warm.  Half completed order (no sauces with food).  Bills were all messed up n we stood at counter 25 minutes to pay.  Asked for manager... Don't have one.  Joke!"}
{"text":"I took my grandma and younger sister out to eat since it was close by. It was hard to find a clean table because they were all dirty. As we sat down eventually ordered our drinks and appetizer which was fried Zuchanie (however it's spelled) it tasted as if it came out of the freezer because the fried Zuchanie I have had is fresh for sure. We went to get a fork to eat and part of our silverware is dirty. It wasn't just a stain it was like someone used it and they reused it again for another customer. The salad we had ordered about half the leaves were rotten and my hamburger was really bland and was not appetizing. Our server was wonderful though. I must add not to be all negative three years ago this place was absolutely good and the onion rings and burgers were fabulous. Now it's just disgusting it must be a new owner."}
{"text":"Love coming here! I come on Fridays and hang out in the bar. Gwen is a great bartender and it's always a great mix of people. Their food is great too. Much better than any bar food I've ever had. If you're looking for a great local bar where they know your name and drink order this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Highly impressed!  Went for brunch on a Sunday. First time going to Gallagher's. Very cheap mimosas and margaritas!  If you're in the area be sure to check this place out. The Pancakes and the sausage were very good!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and terrible food at this place. Really went down hill and has lost many regulars from the area."}
{"text":"Was recommended this place from the hotel My family and I are staying at and I'm regretting ever walking in! The service is terrible. My waiter disappeared for 30 minutes and we only had waters. Another waitress came to take our order and mention how she couldn't figure out where our original waiter went. All the food was cold and burned. So to say the least I would never come back here especially with the attitude our waiter had. I'm mostly surprised that this restaurant has a chain of stores, definitely wasn't expecting that."}
{"text":"I usually don't post negative as everyone has bad days but this is second time the service has been horrible. Overworked, understaffed, out of dishes and silverware, beers poured and left out at least 10-15 mins (sat by bar). Chips and salsa was ordered, we were warned the kitchen is way backed up. Ha, chips and salsa, as the guy went to every table warning them of the shite service tsunami coming their way. Chips and Salsa- pour chips in basket, pour salsa in bowl. Deliver. After 15 mins no beers, no chips. No show. Worst part is owner sat there and stared at us and talked smack to staff about us impatiently waiting for someone. No one could break from that worthless huddle to take ten steps away from their dramatic clump of despair lamenting how busy they are(n't). Again, having happened repeatedly, this owner clearly has zero care for customers and more for having a good time at work. Shame, food is not bad..."}
{"text":"Service was okay, took a while to order our food, all you can eat fish Friday's, fish was fried Alaskan cod and it was okay, tasted plain in my opinion maybe it needed seasoning or salt, had better fish and chips and pubs. Other than that Stella on tap witch is always a good thing for me."}
{"text":"I love Gallagher's!  The staff is so friendly... the manager (Rob) always goes above and beyond to make sure we are having a great time! Its an awesome neighborhood bar! My friends and I look forward to trivia every Thursday... its our favorite night of the week!"}
{"text":"This place is just gross.  But a good place to watch sports and that's it. Food is horrible.  Sometimes I am forced to come here for lunch during the work week. Is it bad when you don't want to order one thing off the menu??!   I will give props to the outdoor patio area but this place is just a straight up bar. There are many TV's for viewing and shouting, whichever you prefer."}
{"text":"High priced DOG food. The boneless chicken wings were barely edible and made my stomach gargle for hours. This was the first time in a long time that I was actually concerned about getting violently ill. The bartender was terrible to say the least. Perhaps working New Years day was too much for her. Gallagher's is a sad establishment; with better management and improvements to food quality it could easily become better than Applebees. Management: Stop offering discount wings during happy hour, your staff gets rude to people who order them because they believe they aren't going to get a descent tip, your not helping yourself."}
{"text":"The Sweet Potato Fries are awesome and the raspberry sauce that goes with them kicks it up another level. Overall though I think this is just the average sports bar food."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous server. Thanks Rebekah! The only thing I would suggest is a REAL au jus.  The au jus you have is oily and has the wrong spices in it.  Just doesn't work.  Other than that, I had a great experience."}
{"text":"I have lived in walking distance of Gallaghers for the last 12 years. I have to say that it now wins the award for the worst restaurant in all of Cave Creek.  Like most people who live near by, I honestly have to say, I am finally done with them."}
{"text":"We have been eating around a little now that we are retired and have time to experience new places for lunch. We arrived just before noon and there was some activity and all the TVs pumping all sorts of yesterdays games or today's sport news.Being the grump I am I asked if one of the 30 or so TVs could be turned to CNBC business news as I like keeping up on my other game.It never happened.  I asked what of three sandwiches would be best today, Philly, Reuben, or french dip. It was suggested that the Reuben. Only half good. The meat was bland as it was held in a water bath to keep warm and its texture was weak. The bread was so so and french fries average. I won't be back. Service was average but had like 4 different peeps at the table.which I don't  care for. I like dealing with one server."}
{"text":"Service is ok. Food is good. Lots of TVs and they have trivia. I go here once in a while. Always get the chicken cordon blu sandwich and a Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"I'm really not picky but service is a bit slow and the food is ok. But $10 for a burger is a bit steep.  Happy hour for a blue moon, $4? Hmmmmm...... What's the regular price? $4.25? 10 minutes to get some Damn hot sauce with my shrimp tacos"}
{"text":"Lindsay is the best!! Great service and always pleasant! The drinks are amazing!! :) Love this place!"}
{"text":"How can fantasy football draft pick last 4 hours?    Hubby and BIL met up with their croanies, where in the past the whole thing only lasted a couple of hours.  Most guys had their high tech strategies all figured out on their lap tops should've made the pick easier and faster, right?  My assessment was that they thunk a little too hard and dozens of empty beers bottles on the table left from imbibition temporarily paralyzed the left hemisphere of the brain.  Just maybe the interceptions of many wives and girlfriends calling them up asking \"what's up, are you still there?\" or \"get yo a$$ home right now?\" slowed them down even more?  I can only speculate.  My BIL got reamed and all he had to say was \"What do you want me to do?\" is his usual appeal.   My hubby got off easily, because it was a day to myself, so I didn't give much of a hoot.  I did make fun of the reaming the whole night...fun times.  I wasn't at gallagher's with them that afternoon, but hubby gives it 3 stars for good burgers.  i hope this event did not set a precedent to the long 4-5 months of football I have to endure."}
{"text":"We went in today to watch a World Cup Game. Every single item we order was stone cold and with no flavor. Seems like they only had about 3 staff employees For the entire restaurant. Tho the place was pretty empty they still took about 45-to an hour to being food out."}
{"text":"Love Em' new ownership, better atmosphere!  Food is always tasty!"}
{"text":"Best service is at the bar   Shannon has my ordering memorized  Constantly refilling my drinks  Always in the ball. She is a great asset to the company"}
{"text":"Great service great food. And the bacon queso fries are my new addiction."}
{"text":"Colton was our waiter, friendly and efficient.  He checked on us often and made sure we had refills on our soda"}
{"text":"Gallaghers is my favorite place to watch games! The service is awesome and so is the food. Vanessa is one of the best servers and jake is an excellent manager!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was good. I had the French Dip which was plenty of food! Real easy going place and definitely will come back."}
{"text":"My friend made reservations for her brother's birthday. We got there early so we could set up the table. When we got there it took forever for us to be seated and we were rushed. It took forever for our food and drinks and on top of that there was gratuity because of our big party. I wonder if the waitress didn't care about the service because she knew she would be tipped a certain amount regardless. Gallagher's is an average sports bar and without customer service I don't see why anyone would come back."}
{"text":"I went with wife and infant baby. It was what I expected from a sports bar but it can use some updating on the furnitue, layout, and menus. Lots of choices on food and a full bar; I'd go again but only because I live close by."}
{"text":"Good rib.. not too greasy. Not too  saucy.. just right. My friends went for all you can eat fish fry and they enjoyed it too."}
{"text":"FUCKING HORRIBLE !!!!! SO MANY TIMES I LEFT NO TIP BC THEY ARE SHIT!!!! everytime I go I LITERALLY wait 15mins for someone to notice me.. last week I went on my 1 hour lunch break and NOBODY. came to take my order I literally had to walk up to the bar and ask someone for a waiter.. then after they came 5 mins later.. AFTER. they NEVVVVER checked on me and forgot my ranch for my wings!!!! I had to get up and once again walk back up there to ask for my ranch... AFTER I finished my food I sat there for 15 mins before I HAD TO GET UP A THIRD TIME to ask for my damn bill!!!!! they are so fucking horrible this one on baseline should be shut down for shitty customer service !!!!!!! it constantly happens when I go by myself (18yr old female) but when I go with my parents they give \"ok\" service... I hate this place and I'm gonna call corporate on them if they do this again"}
{"text":"The portions are soo small! Menu should be a kids menu. The portion sizes are ridiculous, Handful of fries, shrimp should come with a small side or salad. I will say the soda comes in a huge cup so that filled us. I think this company and location is just trying to cut corners or maybe they didn't want to run out of food. They charge you so much and give you nothing."}
{"text":"Good Neighbour hood bar . The food is decent and I like their wings and shrimp skewers !! The cocktails are great . They have a good kids menu . The sweet potato fries and Mac and cheese are great for kids !!"}
{"text":"Drink prices are nice and low! This place is low key and kind of fun to just chill at. My problem was not with the place, food or drinks. The issue is the people the waitresses/bartenders are kind of clueless. They pay attention to the few old men who are regulars there and ignore everyone else. Oh well, you cannot expect the world in a place like this."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, got sub par service. My drink and a few others were empty for 5+ minutes and I had to ask each time for a new one.   I also had to ask for a menu AND for them to take my order, which came out wrong.   I'm sure the service is much better at a table."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drank and get some munchies! Friendly staff and a decent environment! Their ghost pepper sauce is actually hot."}
{"text":"the smell is just absolutely terrible. server named sam is a sassy sass. just a stinky smelly place the food and the smell"}
{"text":"Gallaghers is a decent neighborhood bar and grill.  We went last night for their fried/grilled wings and they were amazing! The prices are decent and the people are super friendly."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd year coming to Gallagher's for Super Bowl game. On occasions we will stop in for lunch. Generally speaking, they have pretty good food. The service is really good. The owner, i think he's the owner, we see him every time we come in and he is always checking on us even after our server has been by. I really like the hands interaction he has with Gallagher's, to me that says alot. Last night i ordered my Kobe burger med-well, it was more like rare, there was no way i was eating that. The owner came by and asked how we were doing and i asked if they could cook it more, i wanted med-well. No problem, he said. Everything else was really good. I had a bloody mary that was really good. Friendly, happy employees. Good place to go if you like off track betting and lots of tv's, drinking and entertaining groups of people."}
{"text":"My son and I just went into Gallagher's last Sunday, after not being in there for awhile. I'm not sure if they're under new management or what, but the menu looks new/updated. Wendy was our server and so awesome. Poor girl was super patient with my 5 year old acting like a maniac and myslef asking a million questions, because I couldn't hear her over my crazy kid. She suggested the Pacific Rim salad, which isn't something I would normally get, but I sure am glad I did! It was A M A Z I N G! The only downfall for me is that they don't show PP fights."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative rating I would. We periodically revisit this place since it is close to home and convenient, but that won't happen again. We were there Saturday at 7ish and sat at the bar-bartender Josh was OK. The issue I had was the patron in the bar, a lady with short red hair with a older gentleman with a cowboy hat. This \"lady\" was so drunk she could barely walk, and every word out of her mouth was a swear word and she was screaming F*** you Josh! Sh*t! F*ck! Apparently her words were not working for her this evening. She was CLEARLY over served, and should have been escorted outside and into a cab. She loudly refused to pay her tab, and was a general embarrassment to all. The food was average-my medium burger was rare, hubby med-rare was well done. If you go, sit at the bar for service-but look out for sloppy drunks and make sure you cut your burger in half before you take a bite. This place also put an OLIVE in a lemon martini-so you can kinda see what you are working with. The manager also sat and bad mouthed patrons with Josh AT THE BAR while we sat there. I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"Me and my work friends pop in here on our lunch break because it's fast and the food is good. There is a ton of parking and seating - and when the weather is nice, the patio is an option. There is bar seating inside or restaurant seating but either way, the service is typically friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has some terrible reviews. I decided to eat here a few times before forming an opinion just in case. I would not say by any stretch of the imagination that this is a cool, hip, stylish local place. What it is, is a fine place close to my house, that allows (encourages, even!) dogs on the patio and will feed you and offer you a cold beer.   If you're looking for innovative, local, trendy restaurants, look elsewhere. If you live close and want a no frills bite to eat and a beer, go here. The wine selection sucks but it's cheap. The service is also not terrible. It's a busy bar and they do a good job to check on everyone every once in a while. There's also a side of the restaurant that is booths if you don't want to sit in the bar area.   My husband loves wings, and they were happy to accommodate him with four wings of each type of wing sauce so he could sample the ones that sounded the best to him.   I have no complaints about Gallaghers. It's not nearly as bad as all of the reviews below. It's just a neighborhood bar with food and tvs. Good for either hanging out with friends or takeout. Give this place a break people!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here when we don't want to eat in Cave Creek and don't feel like driving very far. We usually go in the middle of the day and for the past couple years our server/bartender has really taken care of us. She is always attentive and friendly, I think her name is Adriene.  They have a good beer selection and price point, the food is kind of lacking but what do you really expect in a sports bar?"}
{"text":"Adilene is the sweetest bartender.  She's always super fun and I never have an empty beverage.  I would recommend stoping in and saying hi."}
{"text":"The jalepaneo burger was a good burger. The Chris cross fries were tasty too.  The food took a long time but the manager was cool and gave us my burger free.   Our waitress was from India and really friendly.  Good spot if you like lots of sports TVs."}
{"text":"Wing Wednesday! Always best wings around. Great service and staff is very friendly. Between my husband and I we had bourbon glaze, hot honey mustard, hot teriyaki, hot garlic and an order of bacon skins with sour cream. Down right finger licken good! Gallagher's has about any one beat when it comes to wings. The bummer of this whole story, we have to go out of town to get them, BUT it makes it a greater treat. Our waitress this visit was great, thank you JESSICA."}
{"text":"After reading some dicey reviews on various sites, I was a little hesitant to try this place.  I was very happy I did.  The first, not so surprising, find was the extensive beer list.  Gallagher's has more than 20 micro brews plus a host of major labels.  I quickly found a nice dark that was to my liking and then started looking for a dinner entree. I quickly found a smoked meat plate that sounded excellent.  The two meats that I chose were turkey and corned beef.  I'd never had smoked corned beef before, but I love it and it sounded delicious.  Since it was a busy friday night, I was curious to see how quick the order would show up.  I was pleasantly surprised to get my meal quite quick, even though the ample number of televisions and NTN trivia were keeping entertained.  The smoked meats were all deli sliced thin like sandwich meat, which had me skeptical. However, that's where the doubts ended.  The meats were juicy and wonderfully smokey in flavor.  The smoked corned beef was divine and the turkey wasn't a bit dry despite being thin sliced.  The mixed vegetables were a surprising al dente, delicious and fresh tasting, which is something you don't typically find in your neighborhood pub.  All in all, a very satisfying meal at a decent price.  Even with a lot of possible reasons for things to go wrong, I was pleasantly surprised that Gallagher's delivered much more so than I would expect from your average neighborhood pub.  Good food that went well beyond your average pub fare with quick service and a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Heart and Soul is our go-to, but it was closed last night for a private party.  We had been to Gallagher's one time before, it was okay, so we crossed the parking lot for a second visit.  It will be our last.  I thought the Yelps I had read from previous diners were a bit harsh, but last night we got the full \"Gallagher's experience\".  Sign at the reception desk said: seat yourself.  We did, after searching thru a mostly empty dining room for a clean table.  We sat there maybe 5-6 miutes without a sign of a single staff.  I looked at my watch about then---7.45.  That's why I know it was twelve minutes later that the server finally showed up, sans menus.  She asked for our drink orders and then said, \"Oh, I guess you guys want menus?\"  (Um.,..yeah.)  About 5 minutes later, a Hispanic guy shows up with menus and asks if we'd been taken care of.  We said yes and he starts to walk away and we are like: wait---leave the menus.  He gives us this frantic look, like we are mugging him for the squares of laminated paper, but then he reluctantly hands them over.  (Score one for our team!)  A few minutes later, our server shows up with our drinks and some menus and she frowns at the menus we had scooped from the guy, puts our drinks on the table and starts to walk away, and DH says: no, wait, we are ready to order.  (We did't want to take the chance of losing her!)  I got the fish and chips, DH got the Cobb wrap with onion strings.  It arrived fast and ice-cold.  My chips (fries) were limp and greasy, fish was crispy looking and golden brown, but interior was dry and stringy---can we say over-cooked?  DH said his wrap was bland and dry---the tortilla was so bereft of moisture it was sucking the saliva out of his mouth.  His onion strings would have been delicious hot---they were surprising good even cold and congealed.  He did ask for some mayo to try to lube up the wrap, and seriously---she brought him about a teaspoon in a small black cup. (Gotta watch those food costs!)  The manager did do a drive-by a few minutes after we got our drinks but before our food arrived---how can I answer \"how's everything guys?\" when \"everything\" is iced tea and water with lemon?  (BTW, the iced tea was very good!)  He never came by to check in again. Neither did the server, although she did drop off the check about three minutes after the food---that's when DH was able to ask for the mayo.    Like another Yelper, we paid cash so we didn't have to endlessly wait for change and then got the heck out of there.  And no, we didn't leave a tip.  If our server didn't care about our dining experience, why should I care about her working experience?  Frankly, horrible service and horrible food.  You know, we desperately need another reasonably-priced \"family\" restaurant here in Cave Creek/Carefree---but Gallagher's isn't it.  So if you ever wonder why an attractive place with a decently varied menu is always mostly empty---read and believe the Yelps--I think they are only still open because they have like a bazillion tvs and (no pun attended) they are like the only game in town for that level of restaurant."}
{"text":"Friday fish fry was on point. The service was great, the food was good, the place was clean.   I had fish fry AYCE. The fish was small 2.5 oz chunks so go ahead and reorder as you get your first plate. It was not the best ever but was far from the worst. I would say good not great.  My wife had the burger. I ate a 1/4 of it and was impressed. It had a real nice flavor to the meat.  Child uno had fish... but just a single plate and she was full (17yo) Child dos had the chicken strips and ate them all. (14) Our  cousin had the kids mac and cheese, fried mozzarella sticks and a salad. We all liked our meals."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. We got there about 10:15 to get a cookie dessert. You seat yourself so we picked the one booth that wasn't covered in dirty dishes, napkins, food, etc.. There were maybe 5 other tables of people in the whole restaurant yet it took the waiter a solid 15 mins to say anything even after making eye contact twice with us. After we ordered we waited 25 mins before our cookie was brought out. It was totally burnt and black and tasted horrible. We politely asked for another that was not burnt and the waiter took it back. Waited another 20 mins with no service, meanwhile a group of 8 had already gotten all of there food and finished by the time we got fed up and just walked out. It should never take over an hour to get a cookie dessert and some decent service. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"The beer is cold, the drinks are reasonably priced. This is a nice bar to go and hang out with friends after work and unwind."}
{"text":"I would rate this 3 1/2 stars (3 stars if it had competition).  There is truly a lack of choice in this part of town.  As a lunchtime place, Gallaghers is acceptable.  I generally either have the Bacon, Ham & Cheddar sandwhich w/ Cottage Cheese (instead of frys), or the Chicken Fried Chicken w/ mashed potatoes & Side Salad.  Both are priced around $8.50.  The wait staff is generally pretty attentive, although I have been in there where the wait time is excessive and it is hard to get service in a timely manner.  Perhaps the evening hours provide a more lively atmosphere, but for lunchtime content, it gets an average score."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if you can find better wings in town.  We always get the smoked and grilled and it never disappoints.  I haven't tried much other than these but I'm sure everything is just as great."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here for months there food is very good the  staff here is the best  I've ever met they treat us like family I've celebrated birthdays with the staff my wife is going to one of there  baby showers , people need to lighten up on comments I've been to Many of so called fancy restaurants and there food is horrible along with there staff so if you like fun especially on Saturday nights that's the place karaoke night see you there"}
{"text":"Typical local sports bar and grill that offers the familiar staples i.e. Wings, burgers, fried appetizers etc.  big screen TVs on every wall, you know, you've been to that place. I was really impressed with their starter salad, not your typical iceberg, but actually had Spinach and some mixed greens.  The burger was excellent and full of flavor.  The standout were the waffle seasoned fries.  Cooked to perfection and just as tasty.  If you are craving a bar and grill, you can't go wrong with Gallagher's."}
{"text":"Moved to the area about a year ago and this is one of the only places nearby where I can grab a burger and a beer.  The food is just awful - every single time I've ever gone there the buns have been stale, wet (to the point of being able to squeeze it and have water/juice come out) or otherwise gross beyond description.  The service is spotty and usually they seem like they're annoyed you're there and making them work.  Overall just not a good food experience - NEVER try to dip sandwich."}
{"text":"I love this place !  The best patio in the area .....an abundance of great eats , family friendly.....a super staff.....great place to work !  I play there as often as possible ....."}
{"text":"This place was awesome and Gwen was fabulous. I came here last night after a friend of mine and I were trying to find a place to grab drinks close to where we live. Gallagher's came up on the search offering happy hour and reverse happy hour 7 days a week. Score! We walk in and it wasn't very crowded yet so we grabbed a couple of seats at the bar. Gwen let us know they had specials on Coors light and a special drink for Halloween called vampires kiss which was only $3.00 all night. Yummy. Oh and after 10pm when karaoke starts, long islands ice teas are only $2.00 and believe me, with some of the singers we needed one.   Oh final thing, their wings are amazing and cheap after 10 on Saturday. Our bill was a shocker to us because we drank alot and ordered some wings. So very reasonable. We will most definitely return soon."}
{"text":"I rarely post positive things unless the restaurant is extremely excellent.  I do however post negative reviews when I am not at all pleased.  In this case, we never even made it into the place before the self proclaimed General Manager offended us before we were even parked.  As a manager of commercial real estate, we encourage all businesses to have employees park in spaces of least desire to the patrons.  Here in AZ, we all seek parking spaces that are shaded during these summer months.  We located a few behind the building and there were NO PARKING RESTRICTIONS posted.  It happened that this day about 3:00 pm, we were asked not to park in these spaces as they were reserved for employees.  When we asked where the signs were, he admitted there weren't any but, insisted we park elsewhere.  We did, at another venue.  My only point is that when the self proclaimed GM feels customers are not as important as the employees, we all felt it was not the place we wanted to visit.  Instead another venue received our couple of hundred dollars."}
{"text":"This is a great local hangout.  The food is always fresh, and the staff make it our favorite local spot.  There are tons of flat screen tvs, and pool tables in the back.  They remodeled it last year, and made it very nice.  They run lots of specials, and it is a very friendly place.    And karaoke night is always good for some laughs!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty ok and the drinks were inexpensive and well-made.  My biggest problem with this bar is that despite the karaoke bringing an interesting crowd, there was a huge brawl out front and we had to be locked inside the restaurant until the police came and made an arrest.  The male in the fight had beaten a female so bad that she was immediately taken to the hospital by an ambulance.    Lesson learned--even though this bar is in a decent area, females...do NOT go there alone! (the female apparently did not know the guy)"}
{"text":"So I was down the corner at Magnums for an early drink and smoke.  I heard about this place as a decent dive in town, and it was just down the lot from me.    I walked in and saw what looked like a pretty decent place.  It was a slow night for a weekend, so I went to the bar and stationed a bar stool.  The bartender did the usual \"Hi, what can I get you.\"   I had a country fried steak and a beer.  For 12 dollars, it was a decent meal, and I was happy I ordered it.  Cheap eats and decent booze..  A weekend later I came back.  This time there was two bartenders and the bar was full, so I took a seat at one of the booths.  I sat for about  ten minutes waiting.  One of the kitchen guys saw that I hadn't been helped and showed up with a menu and asked me what I wanted to drink.    I was thankful he helped me.  I ordered a water and a kiltlifter, a Phoenix microbrew.  He told the bartender that had ignored me up until that point that I was indeed there and had intent to be a paying customer.  She showed up with my Kiltlifter and asked if I wanted to eat something, of which I did order the country fried steak off the night menu again.  I reminded her I wanted a water too.    So I get my food. Still no water.  I ask for it again. She said sure.  Ate my food, then got my tab.  Still no water.  First experience: Good.  Second experience: Not so good.  I would recommend this place for a good bite to eat, but don't expect to be able to rehydrate here...  I've heard it's a good place when it's hopping, but I didn't see any eye candy while I was there.  It's a decent neighborhood dive, but definitely not a place I'd expect stellar service, although some of the staff seems well trained, once they pass you on, you may want to flip a coin."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this location a lot with my husband and son but stopped going awhile ago because I really never left feeling particularly satisfied with the experience.   On a whim this week I asked my neighbor if he wanted to go to the neighborhood bar and have a drink... off to Gallagher's we went.  I was pleasantly surprised at the offerings of Hendricks and titos on HH for 5$!  On happy hour there was also a great choice of food options.  I  like to eat pretty healthy as well and the fact that I was able to order sides such as sliced tomatoes, cottage cheese, and slaw very inexpensively and off the menu (so I didn't feel like a burden) was super nice.  The dishes were plated in a very visually appealing manner.  The big po po was nice and crispy on the outside (the skin of any potato is my favorite part) and the portion side was huge for a happy hour dish.  My neighbor enjoyed the chicken tacos.  I wish I would have gotten the bartender's name as she was very friendly and accommodating.  I am glad to have given this old haunt a new visit and will be back!"}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if we could. Sat at table near bar 820pm Saturday night and waited almost 15 mins for server to come by. It was not even moderately busy at this time. We had horrible service throughout our entire visit. Our server never checked on us. We walked up to the bar to get our own drinks. Had 3, left. Dead crowd, dirty wine glasses. Went here because it's a nostalgic old neighborhood spot. Sad. Won't return"}
{"text":"Walked in the door right after 10 with the boyfriend to grab some food. They had karaoke going on in the main room, so we grabbed a booth in the bar area. I am not a yelper, really, but I work in the restaurant industry and I wish I had a chance to write something better. However, we sat down and not one person or employee greeted us for about 5-7 mins. We listened to 3 karaoke songs and nothing. Servers walked by us, sat in the well waiting for their drinks and still nothing. By far the worst way to start off. We looked around and finally were over it and walked right out. At least greet your tables!! Cmon I get it, I manage and bartend elsewhere. They were about half full too, so no excuse. Wish I had something better to say, but they weren't busy at all, just seemed to not care on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"A girlfriend of mine told that a few of them are getting together for some drinks and laughs and that I should join them, so off I went to meet up with them at Gallagher's. When I got there I knew I was lied too, this wasn't just about getting together and sharing come laughs.  Yep my friends were there, but there was no laughter, they were deep into their football games. They are some sport lovin chicks, but the cowgirls where losing (why did they expect it to be different) and they needed to drown there sorrows in beer, well not really I was the only one who ordered a beer, got me a Blue Moon, which was cold and great tasting!   I did order there bake potato, random thing to order I know, but I did. Ordered the veggie baker; it had bell peppers, onions, mushrooms & cheddar cheese. It was good. Also ordered a gooey chocolate chip cookie Sunday, oh man that was delish; a gooey warm cookie topped with ice cream & chocolate syrup, man that was sweet heaven!  Gallagher's had great service, and they have lots, I mean lots of TV's, you can catch whatever sporting activity your heart desires! It was a fun time with my friends."}
{"text":"Went to Gallaghers on a Thursday night for a blind date, I can't really say much about the place because the date and I just wound up talking nonstop and only ordered drinks, it was a great 1st date, but not really great for our waitress who was waiting for us to order, have to say on Thursday nights there is a trivia  night, which brought out a good crowd, but with the questions being asked my date and I felt like we missed the study class and jumped right into the test, wow we only got one answer right , and that made us both laugh too. So went back on Friday night for a follow up date from the 1st, smaller crowd, but great service, we actually ordered this time.  It's a fun little sports bar and I would be back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with my dad- for pub food, it was pretty grand. He had the fish & chips & french fries.. yum! The fish was golden brown and the fries were perfect. They have $1 shrimp tacos on tuesday, so I had three shrimp tacos, as the waitress said they were excellent. Really, they were just three small shrimp in tortillas with cheese, but cabbage and tomatoes came on the side to juice it up. They also were served with a green jalepeno type sauce- AMAZING :) I'd go back just for the green sauce! I got a side of corn on the cob- disappointment! It tasted like the frozen cobs my mom used to boil as a child...   They have a great selection of burgers, with emphasis on jalepeno jack cheese & other spicy treats :) They even have veggie & turkey burgers which I appreciate. After lunch we played pool- small tables, but a nice little game area. $1 pool games after a decent lunch works for me!   Props for their menu variety, nice staff, and a clean relaxed locationnn"}
{"text":"Went there for St. Pattys Day.  They had an add for a free shirt.  After we had ordered food and drinks, we asked about the shirt.  A manager came out and said they were only for regulars and a limited quantity.  We said ok we just asked because we saw it in an add.  He gave us 1 shirt with a horrible attitude.  Never again. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"We went with a large group for lunch and the service was great. Friendly and totally cool about having separate checks. The food is decent too. I wouldn't say I'm a fan but it's better than OK. :)  Check out their daily specials too!"}
{"text":"This place is always top-notch with frosty beers! We come here at least twice a month with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I've worked in the industry for over 15 years and I have never seen such pathetic service, or lack there of.  I have told TONS of people to stay away.  I walked in and after 5 minutes of sitting, by the bar, by the POS system that 4 waitresses were using, I finally got a water.  Then I sat there for over 15 minutes and I was never approached.  They walked by me over 20 times and didn't say a word to me.  I can't rate the food because I was never served but there was no service!  You must be a regular for them to care that you are there or you must be in a pre paid party!  I will never stip into this place again and I will continue to tell everyone I know to stay away."}
{"text":"Service has been good to us. Erin is a great bar tender. The food or  the other hand is awful. Don't get the pizza. It and many other item are previously frozen, then microwaved tasting."}
{"text":"Can't believe I got charged $5.00 for a very small portion of fries. The manager was not accommodating at all. How hard is it to bring out more fries? I felt like it was the twilight zone. Never going back."}
{"text":"Jasmine stuck her tongue out at me. Heckin rude.  But food is heavenly so it's all good."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Consistently slow and rude. It's a shame because it is one of the only places in the area open late on weekdays, but would rather make the drive to desert ridge for better service and food!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming here for their wings. Unfortunately I will never go back. The last time i ordered them, I received really pink and uncooked wings. I didn't eat it so i ordered a different item on the menu. I didn't request a manager but I'm assuming the waitress told her manager and he ended up approaching me. The manager basically lectured me on how they 'smoke' their wings. I was irritated by his approach, i told the manager i always dine at this location and never had a problem. The manager just seemed like he wanted to just argue and justify my order.  It was definitely my last visit here."}
{"text":"I eat here for lunch frequently. I have always found the service to be fantastic. They are attentive and fast. Love to sit outside on their patio. Even when we are the only ones outside a server comes right out to greet you and take your order. Their food is always consistent and great! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. The staff have no clue what food they are out of or currently have. my daughters boneless wings had frost bite on them and tasted rough. The drinks tasted horrible. I ordered a margarita and it was disgusting. Like their margarita mix is expired or something. I will not be returning EVER."}
{"text":"This place is alright.  It's your standard issue bar food and TV's all over the place.  Nothing food-wise sets it apart from other bars.  I definitely liked the outside patio area, it's a wonderfully themed atmosphere; although the misters don't seem to do much in even moderately hot temperatures so I can't imagine wanting to eat out there during the summer months here in AZ.  I think this place is good for the most part but there are plenty of other places that are good too."}
{"text":"Decided to take in a late lunch and a game on a recent NFL playoff Saturday.  Followed the directions to seat myself and sat in the main dining room away from the bar.  It was 1pm and there was not a soul there, very bad sign but I've lived in the area for 6 months and so wanted to have a convenient place to watch sports and have a bite to eat.  I am not a picky guy or a big complainer but I need this place to improve for my own selfish reasons.    They nicely put the #1 UA bball Wildcats on one of the many flat screens, good marks there for having the PAC12 network....BUT...they wouldn't turn on the audio because a couple of other patrons sat down and we had to listen to elevator music the entire time.  I guess their policy is to only put the audio in for the NFL games but they weren't gonna start for another hour.    Burger- good Seasoned waffle fries-really good Wings-disappointing..they weren't crispy Kids menu -a lot of options but the chicken fingers were dry..the sliders were ok Service-ok...could of use more refills otherwise fine."}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday night the start of college football. Had a great time!! Service was fabulous! Food was good, it's bar food we had potato skins, boneless wings and sliders.  We liked the garlic Parmesan wings better than the regular Buffalo sauce. They had some Happy Hour specials on those and other things from 3-7pm.  They had all games on that anyone could want. Tons of TV's. Also at 7:30 trivia started!  No buy in but a chance to win a Gallagher's gift card. Definitely a fun spot to watch the game."}
{"text":"Great sports bar with lots of TV's, off track betting and a huge patio."}
{"text":"Adi the Bartender always smiling and extremely pleasant one of my favorite on the weekend!"}
{"text":"While we were entertained by reading some of the other write ups.  We cannot say anything bad about our experience today.  The server (Adriene) has been with the company for 18 years, 8 at this location and I asked her what changed.  She said that she does the day shift but knows issues exist in all restaurants up in this area.  The issue is well known and attributed to their location.  Only a few restaurants up here and exceedingly hard to staff adequately.  There are not a lot of workers up here so the management does expedite in evenings and weekends (stay in the kitchen making sure food gets out quickly).  With the intention to minimize problems.  I have been here once before in the evening and the service was sparse at best.  I'll need to give it another try and see how things are.  Our food was prompt and delicious.  Absolutely nothing to complain about but nothing ultra stellar either promoting a 5th star."}
{"text":"Decent eats, and cheap beers during happy hour. I used to like their nachos but after new management the nachos changed to shredded melted cheese, which I am not a fan of."}
{"text":"The food is good. But the women's restroom is always disgusting and smells horrible - as in gag and hold your breath."}
{"text":"Not a lot of choices in Cave Creek so we keep trying this one over and over again expecting a different result (isnt' that the definition of insanity???) My husband enjoys the all you can eat fish and chips on Fridays.  Problem is, the service is so slow that there is no way you have all you can eat because it takes forever between orders.  Then there's the problem with asking for refills on your beer because that, too will never come.   Finally, last night was the last straw.  My husband ordered the hamburger with fries and I ordered the Caesar Salad.  The waitress put my husband's lovely burger in front of him (albeit a bit skimpy on the fries)  and then put three or four leaves of lettuce in front of me.  I ask \" Is this the caesar?\"  She said yes.  I said \"is this a side salad?\"  She said yes.  I asked \"if my husband is ordering dinner, did you think maybe I would like dinner too and not a side salad?\"  She apologized and assured me she would bring me the real salad (with chicken and full sized) within five minutes.  Fifteen minutes later, I asked to see the manager who admitted they were having troubles with staff and that if we had sat in the bar area, we would have better service.  Good to know HOWEVER, as soon as she walked away, my husband spotted a MOUSE running across the dining room and we were now done. Never will we walk in there again. Now I know they are in the desert and have a large back door to the patio leaving them probably more vulnerable to creepy crawlies but I , for sure, cannot see one reason to ever step foot into that place again.  I do hope they get their act together one day."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar and grill that is always inviting, friendly and has one of the best group of bartenders in Phoenix.   A special shout out to Addie, Lindsay, Sam, and Bri.  Great table service from Mike and Conner.  Obviously we are happy regulars"}
{"text":"In a couple dozen visits, I have had acceptable service only twice at this place and the employee that provided it both times doesn't work there anymore.  I go because it's a sportsbar with lots of tvs that's close to my house.  The food would be good if served quickly, but that rarely happens.  In fact, this place would probably get four stars for the food, beer selection & tvs, except that the service is just so rediculously bad, it ruins everything.  EVERYTHING.  Maybe someone from Gallaghers will read this, fire everyone on the wait staff, and then start over.   I hate people that tell isolated stories about their one experience with shitty service at a restaurant and make it all one sided like they are not ass holes, but I have this great story I gotta tell about this place and yes I hate myself for it so fuck off.    I got a table with a buddy once outside (we were seated by the hostess) and got passed up by a server for 20 minutes of staring them in the face as they walked by, and then i tried waving my arms around when it appeared one of them was looking in my general direction (which did not work), then my buddy actually got up and snagged one of them, who promised she would be right back.  10 minutes after that I went to the bar & ordered a couple of beers for us.  The bartender acknowledges my beer order and, at that moment, a waitress comes in from outside and tells the bartender that she just doesn't have time for table #xx outside and if he could go get their order that would be great.  So I watch him forget about me and walk out to MY TABLE, talk to my buddy, then walk back in and pour us a couple of beers.    I decided not to say anything because I was actually laughing at this point. Bartender tries to flag down the waitress to give her the beers to take out to the table, but she kept ignoring HIM!   Yes the bartender was unable to get the waitress' attention after he did her a favor.  So, finally she's in the little computer area behind the bar (I'm still just standing there being entertained), and shes keying in some order from somebody, and the bartender walks over to her and says \"I have your two beers for that outside table\".  She says \"what outside table?\"  Bartender: \"The one you asked me to get the order from\"  Waitress:  \"Well take the fucking beers out to the table then\"  Bartender:  \"But that's your table.  I have other customers at the bar\"  Waitress:  \"Then fucking give the beers to somebody at the bar.  Or drink them yourself.  I don't care, I just don't have time for this shit\"  This is so great right!   So the bartender just stands there and looks at the waitress, who has her back to him and then, resigned, he walks back behind the bar, picks up the beers and takes them out to our table.  He comes back in, and asks me again what I wanted (because he forgot all about me), and I order a couple more beers because I know that I probably won't get served for the rest of the night.  So now we've got four beers.   Bartender agrees to \"put them on my tab\".  Over the course of the next 30 minutes with zero visits from the waitress, we work our way through those while shooting the shit.   As we're about finished, the waitress actually has the gonads to come up to our table all sweet and nice, and ask us if we'd like anything else.  No.  She puts the tab (for four beers, so she knows or should know that I went in to the bar to get beers at some point) on our table with a little heart on it and then goes into this whole story about how sorry she is and that the bar has just been sooooo busy and it's somebody elses fault bla bla bla bla.  Thank you.  No tip.  In fact I would take money away from you if I could lady.    Wow that was long and the finish wasn't as good as I remembered.  Oh well.   Go to Native New Yorker instead."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place hundreds of times and never stopped.  The parking lot always seems to have cars in it, especially at happy hour on weekdays.  They offer typical sports bar type food.  My chili was very watered down and my guess is from a can.  My salad was wilted and my loaded baked potato was good but came out on a bed of greasy Chinese fried noodles. ???????  Service was good, but I am always more tolerant when I have a cute waitress (that went really heavy on the mascara and eyeliner - LOL).  Fair meal, fair prices."}
{"text":"The food here is so so. It bar food, cant be *too* picky about it.  Lots of TVs- awesome.  My only real complaint is that, who I can only assume was one of the managers, was walking around w/ a halter dress on that showed way too much cleavage (not to mention the pen she had sitting in it). Theres a time and a place for outfits like that. That time and place is *never* a place that has a kids menu IMO."}
{"text":"Excellent food Service very slow and rude. Watch out Bald headed guy works OUTSIDE TABLES.  Very slow Very very RUDE..."}
{"text":"This place is cool, I usually come on Wednesday becuz its wing's Wednesday's and you cant go wrong with that. The bartenders are cool and nice to talk to, they are pretty flexible about ordering different flavors of wings in small quantities, we have even done 3 wings of each flavor in the book just to try them all. My favorite is the Raspberry and the Garlic."}
{"text":"Changed their menu. No waffle fries, for some reason, they now call chicken wings GOAT wings. No fries with happy hour menu. Happy hour menu sucks. Wing Wednesdays is 99 cents per wing, which is not a good deal. Used to be my go to spot after work. There's a pizza place across the street. Less fun, but at least the food is consistent."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here when they cancelled the Turf Paradise race. We sat at a sticky table and even though the service was okay, the food wasn't. I ordered boneless wings and a side of fries. The wings reminded me of the Gravy Train dog food and had a tough chewy texture. The fries were fantastic but they only give you a small bowl of them. Definitely not worth $2.50. All in all, I wouldn't order food here again and I'm debating about asking for a refund. Even my friend had the Cobb Wrap and said she didn't enjoy it. The bacon was burnt and the taste was bland. I guess we forgot this is a bar and their primary focus is drinks and not food."}
{"text":"New beer prices, new food items, new happy hour, new management, the only place to watch sports on televisions. If you haven't been here in a while, this is worth another try. The yelp reviews are mostly outdated, i don't know why they are so harsh because the place is great. Service is good too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Even though it gets really packed the staff is very quick and always seem so happy. I love coming here for sports games. Highly recommend this establishment . I've had a great experience every time"}
{"text":"Great if you like cross contamination. The boneless chicken wings are breaded in the same as the mushrooms, onions and cheese curds. Just ask to look in the kitchen. You wouldn't eat there if you did."}
{"text":"It appears I'm the last person in north Phoenix & cave creek to know about happy hour here in middle of day on Saturday!  $6.00 appetizers!  I ordered honey BBQ wings baked then grilled.  They were delicious.  Ask for extra crispy as well as that's my favorite! Huge screens everywhere and comfortable seating."}
{"text":"Horrible service, cold food, long wait time. Will never go back to this place again. Use to come all the time and decided to come for my son's 21st birthday only to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here almost once a week the service is bad but we choose to come back do to the good food this visit stopped by to get my son a 3 year old some food at another place I understand it's not from this location but there was 6 of in our party right away the manager (Stacy) came to our table with a very disrespectful an mean attitude telling us \"You can't have any of that food here we don't allow it\" I understand if 3 or even 1 adult brought food from somewhere else but a 3 year old kid??? I believe it's just ridiculous they should understand it's a little kid and they should have more consideration towards them. We live on the west side of town which is about a 30 minute drive from this location and I chose to come here to be treated like this is not a good thing last time we come here!"}
{"text":"Had to meet the wife up on north Cave Creek Road last night, and we stopped into Gallaghers for a quick bite. The staff was friendly and fast, the beer was tasty and cold, and the BBQ hot wings were tasty and cheap (40 cent wings on Wednesdays!). I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I have tried food here a few times, but their food is food... I keep coming back for their pizookie. For those of you who don't know, picture happiness in a skillet. For those of you who want more details... picture a skillet with the most delicious cookie dough still warm and googy with ice cream on top! It is a ten in itself with no need to mention the kind friendly service or other good food (such as wonderful boneless wings that are easy to eat and taste great)."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for wings and a place to watch some college basketball. My fiancé had the medium and I had the honey BBQ. He enjoyed his but mine were way too saucy. I had to wipe quite a bit off to enjoy them. The flavor was good but just too much. The restaurant is clean and our server was good. The only other complaint was there was quite a bit of horse races on and people around us were very serious about the races which made watching basketball a little bit of a challenge. It seemed like if you weren't into the races then you were kinda ignored."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, attentive server. This place was recommended by my sister. The burgers were good, and the waffle fries were great."}
{"text":"Best service in the bar and on the patio (Vanessa and Lindsay)  Great place for football and trivia  Piggy back rides do happen... I've witnessed this"}
{"text":"Come on back.  Ben's back. Things are really looking up.  No more mediocre service or food."}
{"text":"Um...Karaoke night is terrible.. the speakers are turned up WAY TOO loud so not only do you hear bad singing, but your ear drums get murdered by it... I mean be a DJ and control the sound too, it's not too hard.  Well drinks are nice and cheap, but you get what you pay for. Crappy pours. Bartender needs to go back to school on how to do a decent pour.   Only thing that brings it to two stars is that you can gamble on dog races there. That was new and a little amusing.  Happy hour is okay. They could step up their game if the bartenders would give you a real pour and not make excuses when a drink tastes like more water than it does alcohol or soda... you think to keep good PR you'd at least comp that drink of the customer is adamant on the drink sucking (unfortunately my friend didn't get that normal service)."}
{"text":"I can imagine Gallagher's would be a great place to come for football games or other gimmicky nights.  I am not from the area so I came on business for lunch with a few associates.  The food was decent.  I had the chicken, potatoes, fries, and garlic bread.  The bread was different and pretty good (compared to anything on the east coast).  The fries were run-of-the-mill seasoned curly fries, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The best part about this place was, in my mind, the waitresses. Whoever the hiring manager is must have been a former manager for Hooter's, if you know what I mean.   With that said, i'd go here for the plethora of flat-screens and atmosphere, not really the food."}
{"text":"Always pretty solid. Chicken was a little chewy this time. Watched mon night football.  Had the chicken fajita salad and was more than happy."}
{"text":"Cinco de Mayo, last minute decide to hang out with a couple friends but don't want to get too loco since we all had to work early the next day.  We figure Gallagher's would be a safe bet and it was centrally located to all of us.  Two of us get there first and walk into a practically empty bar.  I mean, I know we didn't want out of control, but it would have been nice to have SOME kind of background noise going on.  The annoying thing about all this was that even though it was dead the service was S..........L.......O.........W.............  When my friend and I walked up to the bar the bartender didn't acknowledge us and took about 5 minutes to pour a couple beers for the 3 people sitting around.  Once he finally did make his way over to us he wasn't friendly and took his time pouring our two beers as well.  Once we finally had drink in hand we made our way to the patio outside to try to escape the elderly gentleman who had started serenading me and also enjoy some of the springtime air.  Unfortunately it appears that if you sit outside you do not get to enjoy the privilege of a server so we had to venture back inside whenever we needed something.  Luckily for the sake of our evening we had a good time hanging out with each other but no thanks to this place at all.  It would have been practically the same experience if we had gone to a grocery store, purchased some beer there, and then sat in front of the store.  So you better believe that if that's the kind of scenario I'm looking for, I'm gonna save myself the money and do exactly that rather than paying bar markup prices."}
{"text":"If I could give it less than one star I would. I was told this place was good and boy were they wrong. The only good thing was the burger. The food all looked old and tasted rotten. The server AARON was one of the meanest and rudest and laziest human beings to walk this earth. The manager was not much better. He was all what can I do for u ..what can I do? And then walk away or stare at us.  And then he did take off some of the bill thank goodness. Overall do not bother with this horrible place of an excuse of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Have been neglecting this place terribly recently, but a friend and I used to go here many nights a week for a late-night drink...Gwen is AMAZING at the bar, we love her...she's attentive, hilarious, nice, everything. The food is better than your average bar fare and they usually have a good drink special going...the karaoke is hilarious to watch ;) Interesting mix of people, great place to people watch and just hang out. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely horible, they can't even get french fries right after sending them back. The attitude of the staff was horrible nasty. They had a blond womes walking around asking how everything was every five seconds. She should have been in the kitchen making sure the food was edible. I will never go here again and i suggest you stay away."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times I liked it. 1st sat at the bar and just had drinks with a friend, the staff was nice and quick.  The 2nd time I went I had lunch it was a little pricey because I went to early on a tuesday and had the honey hot -hot wings if it would have been wensday they would have been half the price. They were really good though and I plan on going in on a wed. for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Lots of tv's with different sports on. I was surprised how good the food was for a sports bar. They have off track betting here too. Thursday nights are trivia. Comfortable booths and clean tables. Good prices even when it's not happy hour. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I live in this neighborhood and I have been a few times.  I think about once every six months I come back because that is how long it takes me to forget why I stopped coming here.  We were not off to a good start when they were out of Miller Light.  It was very disappointing.  We got the queso dip and the chicken sliders.  The queso dip was very runny and the chicken was dry on the sliders.  Our waitress barley checked on us, but as soon as she dropped off the check she was back at our table within minutes to cash us out.  I am actually surprised I came back after the owner yelled at me the last time when I asked to watch the Tigers baseball game, he yelled in front of everyone \"what is her problem\"  um is that anyway to treat your customers?  I think the owners just need to sell it to someone that is going to care about the quality of food they serve.  This is sad because I try and support South Mountain businesses but this place makes it hard to support."}
{"text":"Gallaghers is my favorite local bar! I stop by daily for lunch. Vanessa is a stellar server that gives excellent service and Shannon fun & sassy bartender that will always one up you if you want to play the game! Be sure to sign up for the yelp reward of 7% cash back on every purchase plus the in house rewards which is in store credit of $10 for every $150 spent!! Great place"}
{"text":"We were here on KY Derby day and while the betting was fun the service bordered on discriminatory. We were walked by at least 7 times without being acknowledged that we were there at our table. This while the table beside us got service and backslaps every 5 minutes. We walked out. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Monday night bartender won't get out from behind bar and great customers. Second Monday same thing I walked in he looked and started a conversation with a coworker. I sat and waited. Finally got up and left.  All other times service has been great.  Don't go on a monday"}
{"text":"Sean did a great job tonight. Food was hot and tasty. Ambiance is mellow, low lighting and music."}
{"text":"Great sports bar, and off track betting too.  Nice inside and plenty of TVs.  Wide variety of food and a good happy hour.  May be the best sports bar north of the 101."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch today, my first time at G's.  Since I already checked out the menus online, I was ready with the first of many questions regarding my numerous food allergies to ask my server as soon as he walked up to my table- Yes, I'll have iced water, please.  Oh, and could you find out if your bbq sauce contains ...?  (Some don't, you know.)  Next thing I knew, Liz the manager was at my side.  After mentally jotting down which of the \"major\" allergens I was most worried about, she disappeared into the kitchen to do some research: are the sauces safe?  is the cod fresh or frozen, and is the batter *-free?  the fish is def. not frozen, but she'll check re * ingredients... are the breads made in-house?  (home-made reduces the chance of * usage.)    and the verdicts?  lay off all the sauces, just to be sure; not sure on the batter, so stay away.  breads are made locally, and she didn't have any ingredients info.  and with all of that data, i pretty much had most of the menu items crossed off (sandwiches/burgers that contained buns and sauces, entrees that used sauces (award-winning ribs, entrees adorned with sauces,  marinated meats, etc.), fried fish, anything battered.  this left the wraps (well, those that did not use *, sauces, etc.) and the sweet potato fries.  Ah, the SPF!  What was I thinking, laying off of the raspberry mayo for the first half?  This sauce brought the greatness of the fries to a new crescendo.  I REALLY love crispy/crunchy textures (probably due to my compulsion to be healthy and stay away from deep-fried anything most of the time.  Plus, grease-flavored foods really don't rock my boat.  Oh, but these SPF's with the razz mayo were really good.    The meat wrap, $7.95.  With beef tenderloin, $8.95.  Comes with choice of side.  Other sides not listed may require an upcharge- most likely with my SPF.  My beef wrap looked quite appetizing- thin slices of beef tenderloin with SW rice and shredded cheese wrapped in a chipotle tortilla, with shredded salad mix and salsa with sour cream drizzle on the side.  Took a bite.  Mmm... very tasty, but wha?  Is that * in the SW rice?!?!  For the rest of the meal, I was picking * off.  What I really should've done was return the wrap and get one sans rice, since the * juice would be all over the rice.  But the first one took so long to reach my table- I had eaten all but five sticks of the fries- that the option didn't even enter my thoughts.  The fries cost an extra $3 bec. I was served the app portion.  Whatever.  I'm also thinking that the chipotle wrap had * in it.  (I was in pain for the rest of the day, and still am, twelve hours later.)  Yes, I was disappointed, but I can't say all of those minutes chatting with the manager were for naught.  I just wished she and especially the staff were more knowledgeable of all of their dishes and sides.  I'll return for the sweet potato fries and razz mayo.  And maybe a delectable icy beverage.  Anyone know how the margaritas, pina coladas (haven't had one of those in years!), and daquiris are here??    Inside atmosphere (standard booths and rectangular bar tables and chairs with TVs everywhere you look up- like a cafeteria) is a striking contrast to the lazy Sunday, who-knows-who's-coming-to-dinner vibe (bossa nova music was playing in the background) I felt outside as I walked past to get indoors.  One problem- I just can't stand inhaling cigarette smoke while I'm eating.  I can't stand inhaling tobacco smoke anywhere, anytime, actually.  I hope I didn't offend anyone just now... For some people it may be flatus or body odor that offends them; for me, it's smoke.  Unless it's a clove.  Love that spicy scent.  (Body odor offends me, too.  But I digress...)  Anyhoo, for all you sweet potato fry lovers out there, try them here.  You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Boring. Kind of the same thing recreated.  Will go there if I am meeting people but won't go out of my way to be there."}
{"text":"Pretty good little sports bar. Staff is friendly. Had hot honey wings. They were ok, not fantastic, but not bad. I'd get them again. Friend had sliders and onion strings and he loved them. Overall a good place for a beer and catch the game."}
{"text":"Peter was our server and did wonderful all day football Sunday. We're a group of gay men who love good service and football. Peter is our guy! The bartender was a younger girl who was awful.."}
{"text":"During the weekdays, when Adrienne is there, everything works very smoothly. As far as the food, eh, it's ok, but she makes everything work. It's a favorite lunchtime and dinnertime place for me, because I work and live close by, and I love that they have Buzztime Trivia. BUT on the weekends, and in the evenings, it's horrible. The service stinks and a few Sundays ago, I went there for brunch, ordered the country fried steak with gravy on the side. Nothing came out right, and the steak was RAW. I mean RAW, as in still cold. The manager was horrible in dealing with it. She acted like it was somehow my fault. She did take it off the bill, but still was so unprofessional. I will go back, and have, but only unless I know Adrenne is working. She holds that place together. She should be the manager, because she's the one managing it."}
{"text":"Went to see a band we like on Friday, they played on patio from 6-9, had a great time. Happy hour appetizers were tasty, servers were nice, and just attentive enough. Was a bit surprised when ordered 2 beers at the bar when we arrived- $6/ea for a Modelo, and they charged tax on the beers too - so 2 beers were $13.00 - just seems like more than average cost we are used to paying. I guess those tvs above the urinals need to get paid for somehow.  Had fun, will return, a cheap ride with Uber helps."}
{"text":"I waited tables throughout college, it's not hard to provide good customer service. Apparently Gallagher's hasn't learned this.   I've been coming here for years. The menu has tons of different options, there are plenty of tv's, & the patio is cool with the art & waterfall. The service has never been good, but today was exceptionally poor.   We arrived as the same time as a bicycling group after completing a race & grabbed a patio table. We were the only people on the patio not from the race. We waited 5 minutes & didn't even SEE a server. I went inside to get a drink & waited another 5 minutes to even be acknowledged by bartender (even though there was only 1 other person at the bar). I asked for 2 beers & she refused to serve me without seeing IDs & my boyfriend was still outside. Ok fine- I understand & comply with the law- but when I expressed frustration that there were no servers outside, she was curt back to me saying there were 3 & I had to be patient. No. You knew this group was coming & failed to adequately staff your restaurant. Your problem, not mine. As a paying return customer I did not appreciate her attitude. It still took 12 minutes to get our drinks & service continued to be poor. I never received the water or toast I asked for- and the manager was beyond annoying when I ordered the toast so maybe it's a good thing I never received it.  Read the reviews & visit at your own risk."}
{"text":"My coworker and I both got salads with chicken on them. The chicken was very tough and could hardly be eaten so I left most of it. The best part of the bird was clearly not chosen. I see this a lot in restaurants when folks don't take the time to cut and prepare chicken properly. It makes for a disgusting meal. The service and ambience was good. There are plenty of tvs to catch the game or sports news."}
{"text":"Close to home so it's our go to spot... Lindsey the bartender is the BEST! We love her so much she has such a sweet smile and is a bad a** bartender! She makes an awesome blueberry martini!! The outside bar is super nice for football! But the automatic door is broken so it seems difficult for the servers to get in and out with trays of food/drinks :("}
{"text":"Just... Ok :-\ Had wings and fries and they were nothing to write home about. Not to mention they only had one waitress for 17 occupied tables in my section. I must give her credit though.. She was extremely polite and did her very best!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is subpar, and far too expensive. We ordered the wings, and they were rubbery and dry. The staff was friendly enough."}
{"text":"Went after workout on Sat noon for lunch.  Had tenderloin/chicken combo with baked potato, bread and corn on the cobb (1/2 an ear).  Very good and filling.  Lots of TVs tuned to different college football games, and off-track betting if you want to play horses (didn't for now).  Servers were prompt and kind."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night around 8:30 for 2 beers and it was next to dead.  I can see why.  Bartender, an \"attractive\" young female, was at best ambivalent.  Tried to make conversation, but she wasn't interested in talking, at lesat to this first-timer.  She spent a good part of the time either eating or texting.  When I got bill, it referred to me  (customer) as \"Dude.\"  I may be one, but not in your establishment; it wouldn't have done me good to confront her about this failure in  professionalism.  First-timer and last-timer, at least at this branch."}
{"text":"I'd give negative stars if I could. This is the second time we've walked out of this place.  At this Gallaghers you seat yourself, which is not a problem but no one pays attention or cares when you walk in and sit down. We sat there for 20 min and then had to go to the bar to ask if anyone was working the dining room.  Someone came out, took our drink order, and gave us some menus but never came back to take our order.  We sat there for 15 more min and no service. This was Sunday evening at 530 pm! We always forget how terrible it is, and since there aren't many restaurant choices up here  we always end up giving them another try.  As soon as we sat down we remembered why we've repeatedly said \"we're never coming back\". Well, this time we mean it.  Gallaghers needs a whole new management team that actually cares."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could. I received my burger with a gigantic hair inside all the sauteed onions topping my burger. I went to get my server and asked to have my burger remade and she came to look at it. I showed her the hair and she first told me that she didn't see any hair. I then had to touch the hair and pull it all the way out of the onions and put it on the plate for her to see it.  I understand sometimes this happens, but it was handled very unprofessionally. The other people in my party completed finished their meals before I got a new burger. Nobody ever came out to offer me a salad while I waited, and a manager never came out.  Finally my burger came out after 20 minutes and it was covered in cheese, and I had specifically asked for it to be removed because I'm lactose intolerant and can't have cheese. At this point I asked for a manager and was told that there wasn't a manager present in the building.  I was then informed by my server  that she could \"take the item off the bill if I wanted something else.\" Now why would she possibly think I would be paying for this burger at all after finding a hair in it, having to wait for 40 minutes for my food after receiving it the first time, and waiting for two remakes??  I won't ever be returning."}
{"text":"It is bar food but it's more of a sports sports themed Applebees. I'm not a really big fan but the service is pretty good."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  Sat at the bar and the two girl bartenders we're too busy talking to each other than waiting on the guest. Asked for a menu and never even got to order before gave up and left."}
{"text":"Horrible food!!!!! Great Service:) The wings were not seasoned properly. It was not appetizing and probably won't go back to try something different...."}
{"text":"Huge place, multiple seating areas. I came on a Saturday afternoon, there are a bunch of locals with no hosts, probably because it is not very busy (maybe 25-30 people)? So don't expect a lot of attention. I sat myself around the perimeter of the bar then waited a few minutes & the bartender (from behind the bar) hollers \"what can I get you\"? Then comes around with my drink & a menu, Same procedure for my order. I am not complaining just explaining my experience, I don't mind @ all since I like a local bar with plenty of room & a casual (bar atmosphere). Honestly too many places think they are upscale & charge you for the \"hospitality\". The place is clean, cool & roomie.  They have off track betting! Happy hour all day (11-6). Approximately 50 TV'S. Ordered the boneless wings (cut chunks of chicken deep fried with honey hot) good taste & texture. $5 I will be back."}
{"text":"Dinner last night was awful! Burger was very rare (not done) yes....burger! Spud had very under cooked bacon....yuck!!! Management was not concerned about our disappointments! Won't go back again!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and shrimp taco Tuesday.   The tacos were very tasty and a great value for $1.75.  Also had the boneless wings and sloppy nachos.  Both were very flavorful.   Overall, the food service and value make this a four star stop.   We will definitely go back in the future."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Gallagher's Saturday night for dinner.  Yes, it was Valentines Day; but my wife and I have been together for 15 years and neither of us like to do Valentines dinner out for the obvious reasons (crowds, long waits, mediocre food, etc...).  We would rather enjoy each others company and have a good time just being together.  I have been going to Gallagher's on Fridays with a group of friends for lunch.  I have enjoyed my lunches.  So far, the service and all the food I have tried has been very good.    So anyway, we walk in and grab a booth.  The server comes over, introduces herself and tells us she will be taking care of us this evening (standard for most places).  We ordered a couple of iced teas and checked out the menu.    We ordered our meals and an appetizer that was on happy hour special.  This was about the last time we saw our server (other than her walking by and looking at the table).  The manager (I'm guessing on this, he could even be the owner...) delivered our appetizer, our meals, refilled our tea, checked to see how we were doing, etc...  Our server wasn't overloaded w/ tables, and the place was not packed (we went early, about 5PM), but it seems that we were an annoyance to her and not a table of customers that she was supposed to be \"taking care of\".    She did show back up when we had finished our meals and asked if we wanted desert.  We declined because we were full.  She brought the check, I put my card in the folder for her to run.  When she returned the folder, she just set it on the table while walking by; no \"thanks\", no \"see you soon\", no \"go to hell\", nothing.  I won't put the server's name on here because I don't want to embarrass her.  I understand it was Valentine's day and maybe she didn't want to be there, or maybe it was because we were not drinking alcohol.  I don't know...  My wife and I are pretty easy, we don't ask for a bunch of substitutions, we're not needy.  Just bring us what we order, fill our glasses when they're empty, and check on us once in a while.  Do those things and you will earn yourself a nice tip (I usually tip about 25% up to 40%).    I will also say that we had dinner on Friday night at the Gallagher's on Carefree Highway.  The food there was also very good, and the service was great (and they were busier than the Union Hills store was on Saturday).  Our server checked up on us a couple of times, the manager came by to check on us, even the young gentleman busing the tables wished us a good night.  This review is not so much about the food, which has been very good to excellent on EVERY visit (worthy of five stars!), but about the service we received on ONE occasion when we stopped in for dinner."}
{"text":"Unlike the other reviews I've read. This place is actually good to me. I think it all depends on were you seat. I've been at the bar/sports area and yes, my service was fair and my food was lukewarm (cookie not close to hot) and great drinks.  When I come, I sit in the dinning area (located on the other side of the bar) service is wonderful (Thank you, Jennifer) food is nice and hot and even looks freshly cooked and sent right out. Maybe tips are better LOL. Will I be back? Yes, where would I be seating myself? Take a guess ;)"}
{"text":"Great TVs. Cheap drinks. happy hour food prices are too high.  Game room with pool and darts.  Nice patio.  Like that they turn on the sound for games.  OTB.  Clean, decent sports bar."}
{"text":"Totally dead on Tues night.  No TVs visible when sitting at the bar. They need TVs instead of liquor bottles above the bar.  Like about 10 of them.  No TVs on Patio.  Very outdated decor.  This place will not be open much longer."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was pretty disappointed. The wings were tiny, seriously the smallest wings I have ever had, like mini wings. The meat plate sounded good, we ordered chicken breast in bourbon sauce and pulled pork. The chicken was good, tender, juicy and had great flavor. The pulled pork was served dry and had a weird taste to it, like rubber.. Even with tons of BBQ sauce it was still dry. The corn on the cob was mushy and the salad was wilted. Bad meal overall, but good service and icy cold blue moon."}
{"text":"Great food for a sports bar. A lot of TV's and modest pricing. The wings have multiple sauce options and are always cooked perfectly, absolutely a must try."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give a good review, I just cannot. My waitress talked me into the rib special, and I ordered an appetizer with it.  The special came with 2 sides.  My waitress came back 2 times cause she forgot my sides, and then forgot what type of beer I ordered.  Of course she did not write it down.    My wings and ribs came out together, first thing that I should have realized that no one really cared how I was taken care of.   I ate my wings first and then cut into my ribs to separate the bones.  My ribs had only been at my table for 10 minutes but when I bit into my ribs the felt like they had just come out of the fridge and never really heated up before they were served.   I am sure they were heated, but not enough to bring the meat up to temperature.    Of course, they were not good, incredibly below average for a smoke house.  My waitress was pretty involved with other people, and I am pretty sure she stayed away because she knew I was not happy with the food.  I cannot speak to any other items on the menu as I did not have any, but the service and the rib special here was just not something that should have been served."}
{"text":"I hesitate to give these guys three stars, but I feel that it's four stars half the time and two stars the other half, so three it is. I went there tonight for a beer after the Phoenix Suns game and actually received attentive enough service from the bar. This is good because it allowed me to try some of the great local microbrew selection. My last trip, however, I walked out due to lack of service -- same problem I've had on other occasions."}
{"text":"Jorgie is awesome , always a great night talking with him. Dinner was good. Disappointed to see the country fried steak off the menu.   P.s. Jorgie rocks."}
{"text":"OTB, and like all the others I've been to, feel the beers are a bit overpriced. We only go here for the Kentucky Derby due to location and a friend's invite. The service has always been really good. It is definitely nicer than the Arena Sports Grill which I find dark and dingy compared to Gallagher's. They also happen to have one of the better patios although it faces west and is too hot in the warmer weather. If you are a gambler, I would imagine this is a great place for OTB."}
{"text":"Why would a vegetarian want to eat at a sports bar? Because Gallaghers makes it easy. Three different times, from three different servers, I've asked for a modified wrap (sub chicken with avocado). The servers are all very kind. The food comes out uber-fresh.  FRESH SPINACH!!! And they don't charge extra for the substitute. The side dish for this wrap offers steamed veggies, that come out steamed perfectly. Not overcooked. I am THRILLED with gallaghers. Wendy and Adrienne are both super friendly. I nearly forgot to mention how very ice cold the beer is served, in frozen glasses."}
{"text":"First off, I used to love this restaurant. Staff was always courteous and friendly, food was exceptionally delicious, etc. However,  since new management this place has taken a dive. Heard a gentleman (whom I presume to be the manager) shout profanity whilst children were present. Which in a bar setting is to be expected, but this was in the afternoon. Carrots tasted like soap and gnats were in my veggies. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Oh Gallaghers my local spot gotta love this place a cheers of South Phoenix good beers and drinks new menu is much improved a plethora of TVs to watch any game you want!! Good times!! Cheers!!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times with friends. This is a great place to watch the game and have a few beers. They are very accommodating to large groups. There are three completely separate seating areas.   The bar and surrounding seating is lively and usually busy. The staff is pretty attentive and there is always a buzz.  The patio is spacious. It is more busy in the evening and has a laid back feel.  The dining room is big and much more quiet. It is much darker than the bar area. It is usually pretty empty in there. Wait staff is a little less attentive since they seem pretty busy in the other seating areas.  They do karaoke one night a week in the bar area. Honestly, the crowd doesn't seem very interested. The hostess sang more than anyone else and the songs are dated.  Overall, I like the place. It is a good place to hang out."}
{"text":"Okay. I've stuck by this restaurant through all the bad customer service, even gave them a good review, and have continued ordering food repeatedly. But seriously, enough is enough! I've ordered take-out from this place no less than five times. Every single time, there has been something wrong with my order: no bread, wrong dressing, missing ingredients, etc. This last time, I ordered the filet salad with asparagus, and there was no asparagus on the salad. Okay, I decided. That's it. I called and complained. The woman I spoke to informed me that asparagus was out of season and that's why! First of all, this was late march--prime asparagus time. Secondly, you don't just leave ingredients off a dish without informing your customers. She tells me a manager will be in a couple of days later to address my concerns.  In their defense, a manager actually did contact me. I decide I won't obliterate them on Yelp. Then she tells me the same thing as the other woman. \"Asparagus is out of season. That's why.\" Again, LIES ALL LIES!! Late March to Mid April IS ASPARAGUS SEASON! It's like 2 cents a pound right now at every grocery store, but at Gallagher's, it's out of season! Ridiculous!   I think I'll use Gallagers's logic and open a restaurant. I will offer a wonderful prime New York Steak plate with a baked potato and broccoli for only $19.95. Only when you get your dish, all that will be on there is a plain potato. Because, duh! Prime New Yorks are out of season. And Broccoli is out of season, too. And so is butter and sour cream. Here's your plain potato. That will be $19.95.  I told the manager I should at least get a refund for the asparagus since it was advertised as a salad with asparagus and there was no freaking asparagus!! She says she'll leave me a gift card at the restaurant. Fine. I decide once more I won't obliterate them on Yelp.  Except I get to the restaurant and the gift card is for $5!! Not even enough to order a cheap dish there! And to top it off! They don't give me the bread for my salad lol!   Sorry, Gallagher's, but you've lost a loyal customer with your horrid service and complete chintzyness. I'm done with you! Good riddance! Buh-bye!"}
{"text":"I live really close to this restaurant and have had 6 bad experiences from service in this place!   When we first walked in tonight, no sign to tell us to seat ourselves, actually have never seen a sign but I took it upon my self to seat our family.  Our server came by and took our drink order, after 10 minutes he came back and asked us if our son had his Sprite, it was pretty obvious there was no glass in front of him.  I was also told our beer orders were in and they will be right up.  7 minutes later the drinks showed up. Then after that we noticed our waiter in a nice long conversation with a table a few away from us.  We kept looking but it did not phase him, at this point I was done and said finish our drinks and we are gone.  I noticed another person of staff come around the corner and look at our server for at least 20/ 30 seconds with a stern look on his face so I figured it was a manager.  I got his attention and told him our problem, saying this was our 6th time with bad service and we were hesitant about going back but it was Sunday and we live close so we would try it again.  BIG MISTAKE..........  I had my conversation with this manager and then our server realized he was in trouble so he decided to listen in.  I explained everything and saying this has not been our first time, and we have many friends with the same experience cause we all live in the community behind this convenient restaurant.   This restaurant needs to get a real serious manager on board and fire the entire wait staff !    If you want to drink at the bar this place is for you.  If you have a family and sit at a table then STAY AWAY.  Too many excuses whenever we go there.    I really wished a different restaurant would buy them out and we saw a new breath of fresh air.  It's really convenient for a lot of people in this community and someone needs to wake up and read these reviews.  We are telling the truth.     We ended up at Wendy's."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the food is always sub par in my opinion. I understand that it is bar food but even bar food should at least meet the value of what you are paying. They take a long time to serve you as well. I got wings last night that were the smallest chicken wings I have ever been served. Like others have said, they have a lot of nice tvs but if this place wasn't the only game in town they probably wouldn't be around anymore."}
{"text":"Big groups are hard to take care of, and when you're out with a party of about 15, you expect a few sides of of dressing, or maybe the request for no cheese on the sandwich, to be forgotten. No big deal.  But when 2 people in the party are forgotten completely and no effort is made to make them happy, that is a big deal. The manager even came out and asked if everything was fine, and when we pointed out 2 people were missing their meals, the manager said \"I'll go check on that\" and was not seen again for the rest of the evening.  The food itself was fine, but there's no much the kitchen can do when they don't receive the order.  The next day one of the party checked her statement and found she had been charged for 2 different bills. When she called to get it corrected, the manager told her \"oh, they rang you up wrong but I told the waiter to let you know we reversed the charge.\" No responsibility taken.   Next time the office has a reason to celebrate, we know this is not the place."}
{"text":"As much as I would like to have a decent eatery near-by, this ain't it.  Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.  Equally important to us is how the staff tolerates F-BOMBS from all the sh*t-kickers who come here with their pea brains.  Can never bring my kids here.  The staff do nothing because I suppose the booze brings in more money than the food.  Heart and Soul is just a few yards away and while they don't have the TVs-galore, the food is better and the environment is much more family-friendly.  This place needs to die a quick death."}
{"text":"It took a LONG time to get noticed / get some service. The tables were nice and clean. The 'boneless hot wings' looked more like cat food with mystery sauce on them - EASILY the worst wings I have ever had... At least the Lagunitas was served cold and tasted good. The fries were 'meh, kind of ok' - overall a missed opportunity and a disappointment. Do NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!!!!! Don't go Saturday nights. There's a waitress with black hair cut in a bob and a waiter with a pointy beard. Both must hate their life because they certainly act like it. him more than her. Been there many times thinking they just had a bad night but it is like that every visit we've gone. Straw that broke the camels back he decides to overindulge himself a $50 tip. Didn't notice it till the next day when we called to try to get our money back all they offered was a gift card to that nasty restaurant. The owners would be so disappointed to know how these waiters and waitresses gave their company such a bad name. My friends and family and I will never step foot in another Gallagher's again."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this place. My burger was good and I had a lot of choices  but my husbands chili was very generic and tasted like it was microwaved. The staff seemed good at first but as the night went on it only got worse. Not the worst place to eat but not a place I would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Awesome place. I just moved to Arizona and use yelp to find everything and I am glad I found this place. It's my new spot!"}
{"text":"Some times they don't notice your even there because you seat yourself but the food is good especially the build your own burger"}
{"text":"Haven't hear for a long time as the food is no more than mediocre.   They don't seem to try.  We had the sloppy nachos.   We got the large order for us to split.  It cost $12.95 which seems like a bit much for the portion size.   While reasonably tasty, the cheese was cheese whiz.  Come on! !  When we got therr, there were many tables that needed bussing.   Makes me a little nervous   If this was a Mexican restaurant,  I would have sent it back.   Will we come back?   Most likely,  no. There are just too many better alternatives ."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here before, so I may be back and sample the grub. I wandered in here on a Thursday night because I found out on-line that Gallagher's had wireless trivia you could play against other participating bars all over the nation. I got a little hooked on the NTN/Buzztime trivia recently during a trip to Austin, TX, and now I wanted to find a place in my backyard in which to play.  There are a ton of flat screens throughout the bar. I spied the trivia countdown being broadcast on one mounted beyond a comfortable viewing distance from my barstool. The bartender was very accommodating. He set me up with a wireless box and beamed the trivia broadcast to a screen right next to the bar. After I logged on, I was good to go.  This place was kind of underpopulated and underwhelming. Maybe a dozen bar patrons total and about five folks alternating turns at the karaoke microphone. But I was able to hunker down with my pint of Kiltlifter ($5 each... kinda pricey) and geek out on trivia. Placed 12th in the nation during one round but was the only player on-line here. Kind of a bummer, since it can be fun to talk trash to the other trivia hounds if you're lucky enough to be in a bar packed with nerds."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sports pubs. Our team generally goes here straight after practice or after the game almost every week. We have been there at all times possible almost, and the service has been good. The best part about this place is that the happy hour is on everyday and great prices. A lot of appetizers are dirt cheap during hh.   My 3 most favorite or common foods here are   1. boneless wings (toss them in so many different flavors - try the honey hot by itself, or mix it with mustard or the habanero hot if u have balls for spiciness :))   2. Chicken fajitas, they are so good and plentiful. i always substitute chicken with veggies  3. Habanero burger: - its one of the best combinations of a burger i have seen. I of course sub the beef out, but others have told me the reg beef patty is good too.   I love the side of cottage cheese too.   The restrooms are decent and they have pool tables. They have a lot of TVs with lotsa games playing all the time. They also have a jukebox. I have never been here after like midnight, so cant imagine how the scene is there then. looking to reading about that though."}
{"text":"We went for the first time last Wednesday and let me start off with how amazing the staff was. Wings were amazing especially the boneless wings definitely returning happy hour on point!"}
{"text":"Simple review, if you're in a hurry Gallagher's is not the place for you. Short and sweet of it is this. \"Nice staff, slow service\". Ordered our food at 1230 got our food at 0115. Will not be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible! I've gone a handful of times hoping that this time I will have a better experience.\" but no luck. The food is okay - typical bar food nothing special! Wait time is long..."}
{"text":"Used to come here for one of the best fish frys in town but the quality of fish has really gone downhill. It's obvious they use the tail end and that's it. I can't give it any less than three stars because the rest of the menu is really good. Too bad about the fish"}
{"text":"Nobody in here, and service is horrible! Waitress hasn't come around one time. Flies everywhere (and we're inside), no excuse. I had a pizza that was not good at all."}
{"text":"The Arizona  Cowgirls had their Christmas  luncheon there Wed December  2nd  and Amy and her staff Jessica and Michael did a awesome  job waiting on  40 of us. Thank you"}
{"text":"In our six months living in South Phoenix, my husband and I avoided this place, thinking that it would just be another Applebee's, Chili's, Native New Yorker - you know, a chain with typical, bland American food. We finally decided to check it out last Wednesday night (our night for a mid-week outing) and were pleasantly surprised.   We sat out on the covered patio, which is really nice. It's really spacious, has two sections (one with low tables and one with high tables), features three huge flat screens, and has plenty of misters. You can also smoke on the patio, since the entrance to the restaurant is around the other side.   Our server greeted us promptly and was very friendly. To drink, we ordered vodka sodas, which were priced very well at $2.75 a pop! We noticed that on the menu they feature tons of different burger preparations/styles and let you choose your patty type (between an Angus patty, Kobe patty (for $3 more), a chicken breast, turkey burger, and a veggie patty) and your bread type (ciabatta, sesame bun, multigrain bun, sourdough, multigrain bread, rye, and bed of lettuce, which is nice for those watching their carb intake!). We had heard good things about their veggie burger, so we got the Southwestern style burger with the veggie patty. We also got the seasoned fries and a dozen hot honey BBQ wings (which are $.40 each on Wednesdays).   All in all, we were really impressed with the food. The veggie burger was among the best I've had, the fries were crispy and not too greasy, and the wings were flavorful with a nice kick of spice. We also only spent $30 or so for all of the food and three drinks.   This is a great spot for some mid-week relaxation, cheap drinks, and solid food. With the weather as nice as it is right now, the patio is also a great feature. We will most definitely return."}
{"text":"I went to this place for late night food so there was not a whole lot of choice that I knew of.  The food was your typical bar food.  It was nothing spectacular but I would go back if I had to for some food.  One thing that was funny...my buddy tried to order Negro Modelo since there were signs advertising this beer and it was no longer available."}
{"text":"Crazy cat lady was hilariously funny, charming and prompt with beers and service. Sex panther on tap is a plus!"}
{"text":"Decided to give Gallagher's another try yesterday. It had been 5 months since the last time I was there. When I arrived there were 5 people sitting at the bar and one bartender. It was pretty dead at lunch time on a Saturday. She saw me come in and acknowledged me, I asked for iced tea and  a menu. She brought my tea, but no sweetner, so I grabbed a couple of packets of a table behind me. It was at least 10 minutes before she came back to take my order and there were no other people at the bar. She never told me her name. I ordered the Baja Burger with a chicken breast and she asked me how I wanted it cooked. Hmmm My food came, the sweet potato fries were good. The bun was dense and dry and I took it off and only ate the chicken and avocado with a fork and knife.  When she came back I told her that I didn't like the bun. She seemed uninterested. I asked for my bill. She brought it, right away, but didn't pay any attention when I wanted to pay and leave. About 6 people came in and she waited on them, and I kept trying to get her to cash me out so I could leave.  I'm done with this Gallagher's. They just keep getting worse.  This Gallagher's location is now closed."}
{"text":"I'm taking back my review how they were the 2/3rd best wings in Phoenix .. guess there is a new cook in town. Doubt I will go back honestly why risk it .. they are quite inconsistent this year. Oh well"}
{"text":"The tvs are smaller than the location on carefree highway but the wings are better and local brew choices"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. Hit it miss service. Once we walked out when nobody showed up at the table. Today, we found the burger and bun size shrunk and the portions of fries got smaller.  Asked the manager what happened to the rest of the fries and her response was 'they portion the fries now'. I asked if they portion the price and she said no. So, like the Obama economy, we are getting less and paying more (or maybe the same). The menus changed so I'm sure they jacked prices too.  And, finally the sloppy nachos.....after getting 1/2 way through it, we found a long hair entangled in it!  Wow!  How unfortunate. The sloppy nachos was a nice portion and the best part of the meal and they messed that up too!  The polish dog for $4.99 was a great meal but again, the fry portion was inadequate. Come on folks.  Don't cut the portions, raise the price to accommodate your shortcomings!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting this location was Friday evening. I had wanted to check it out for years but it kept slipping my mind prior. My boyfriend and I sat in the restaurant side. We ordered many tasty wings and a few beers. We ordered the habanero hot, honey hot, and ghost wings. They were some of the best wings I have tried thus far.  Our server was awesome. He was prompt when we needed service, but not an annoying hoverer. He even asked if we wanted extra ranch which is always appreciated in my opinion. I will be returning and bringing friends."}
{"text":"I like how close this place is from home. Their wings are pretty good and there drink specials as well. The have plenty of TV's surrounding the bar so you can watch your favorite game."}
{"text":"Clean, hot food, solid service.  Went in not expecting much and loved how many tv's were on different events."}
{"text":"Good hang out for sports. This place does get very crowded on peak hours.  Good Happy Hour!   Awesome wings if you get them baked and charbroiled. Ghost pepper wings are legit. The Best and only boneless wings I will order in AZ."}
{"text":"This is our second time here and feeling the same way as the first. Bar area is too full to sit in so we sit in the back dining area with tons of tables and it's all seat yourself. We had someone come right away for drinks but then can never really tell who our server is and it takes a bit to order.   Last time we ordered an app and 2 entrees and got the app after the entrees - which sucked because we ended up having too much food. Large portions, food is good for bar food. Didn't like the chicken tenders, but had good wings and a wrap. Have a large menu and seem to have decent specials.   Sadly we live in south Phoenix and thus will probably continue to come because it's the close sports bar with the best draft list. Lots of Four Peaks and other crafts."}
{"text":"Husband is a regular here and the staff is always welcoming and happy to serve. I've never had a bad experience. Food can be hit or miss though. Husband swears all the food is amazing, but I've had weird moments. Some items are exceptionally amazing (the Alfredo on thursdays is divine) and somethings just aren't my style (all their sauces for the wings are kind of odd). Good beers on tap and good service - excellent vibe and food."}
{"text":"I've been here at least a half dozen times if not more. Always neat atmosphere but hit or miss with the food. I really don't like their chili burger with bits of sirloin in the chili, nasty!! Their country fried steak can be nasty as well; however their chicken fried chicken is pretty good. The best meal was their chicken taco salad...really delicious.   The atmosphere is OK; they have a lot of TVs all about even the outdoor patio. I think it would be difficult to watch NFL Sunday games there; the place is not large enough to have the sound going for each game without it' simply being noisy and can't hear your game.   At most, this place is a nice local joint for South Mountain, OK meal, and OK beer selections to meet up with friends once in a while."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place only has 2.5 stars!! This is our favorite neighborhood spot to go to. We've lived nearby for about two years and find ourselves in here about once a week, sometimes more! Trivia night is so much fun (rapid fire questions during commercial breaks of whatever is on so be aware, it's not the usual question then a song or two to answer ... also it gets BUSY so be patient with the staff, they're moving as fast as they can!), karaoke night is way fun (I don't sing but the people that do are really good!!), and the drink specials are great!! The beers on tap are always fresh and cold. The food is delicious too!! I love their boneless wings when with a few people and the g mini sliders and waffle fries or Caesar wrap for dinner!!"}
{"text":"The service and the food were equally awful.  I ordered skinny chicken flatbread, which was supposed to be chicken, mozzarella cheese, a drizzle of baja sauce and a touch of cilantro.  We were on the patio, which was dark and poorly lit; my food arrived and I started eating it.  Two bites in, I realized they had thrown in jalapeno hot peppers, which were buried under the mozzarella.  Since I'm allergic to them, I was unable to eat more of my dinner.  I wrote a letter to them over a week ago explaining that you can't throw ingredients into a dish that are NOT on the menu...frankly, it's dangerous.  I've heard nothing.  If I could give NO stars, I would."}
{"text":"Benjamin is the best!! We love coming to his restaurant every Friday for our safety meeting!! He's super friendly, very accommodating and so much fun!  Our food is always fantastic. I suggest the fireball burger!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! I have only been here one time but my one time was worth it! I came here for appetizers with a friend and we got the potato skins which were amazing!"}
{"text":"We ate here awhile back on a Friday night to have their fish and chips. Needless to say, the only good part of the meal was the coleslaw. We had to send back the fish as it was cold, so this told us it was either frozen fish or they just don't know how to cook authentic fish and chips. We received a new order and it was okay but ate it. Offered an apology but no indication they would consider paying for the meal. Wouldn't order this again, and we also heard from some other people in the establishment someone had told them they just can't seem to figure out how to use the fryer to make fish. So if that's the case, maybe they should take it off of their menu until they figure out to use the fryer and make good fish and chips. Thank you for listening."}
{"text":"Really great place for lunch. Had the Wedge Salad and it was terrific. Service was good and the waitresses are really nice. Really good portions and will definitely go again."}
{"text":"First & LAST time. I had friends from Florida visiting, I was embarrassed taking them there. First of all, we went MID DAY. There was literally no one there. We had to sit ourselves because no one was at the front. I ordered boneless wings. What I got was what looked like a chicken breast diced and breaded with the sauce on top.. Did not taste well. The server... if you hate your job, at least try hiding it... With no one at the restaurant and around 15 tv's on, we requested a specific channel. The manager came to say it's not possible... WITH NO ONE THERE... You are better going off going to Native New Yorker or Applebee's for reals..."}
{"text":"This Sunday afternoon I had an hour to kill while my daughter was at basketball practice so I searched for \"Sports Bar\" in my Yelp app.  Gallagher's came up and I was surprised.  I haven't seen on of these places in quite awhile.  I honestly figured the info was outdated, but it was the closest location to catch the Cardinals game...  What do ya know... it's here!  From the outside I figured it was dead.  One couple was on the patio watching a football game.  When I walked in though, almost every seat was filled.  I think every game was on TV or on many TVs.  I didn't count them, but I think they must have have 25 TVs.  The Cards game was on 25-30% of the TVs including the big screen in the bar.  So...  I grabbed the only booth I saw available and sat my butt down and ordered some chili and a coke.  The chili was pretty good.  It seemed to be better than a freshly opened can of Hormel, with more meat than beans and topped with onions and cheese.  Perfect afternoon snack.  The service was OK.  I got helped within a few minutes of sitting down and she checked back every few minutes.  My soda was delivered in a couple minutes and my chili came within 5.  I'll certainly come back here on gameday if I'm in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Shannon is the best! Always makes our day enjoyable. We come 3-5 times a week just because of her."}
{"text":"First time here. Staying in Yuma for vacation. Staff great. Food great. Prices great. Definitely b back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I didnt have a terrible time here, but it wasnt a \"wowing experience\" either.  The bartenders have that \"dont bother me\" personailty. Not what you want when you walk to a bar, and an empty one at that. Its cool that there are games attached to the bar tops, will keep you entertained. I feel like the crowd here is a little on the trashier side, not saying I'm classy or anything. Just an observation.  Egh, probably wont come back."}
{"text":"Great fun local spot for the baseline corridor. Good staff that treat you like family. Smoked meats are good"}
{"text":"We've given this establishment our dollars on many occasions since this location has been opened.  The visit on Sunday (9/21)  will probably be our last. We were looking forward to watching football in a fun, group setting.... eating some awesome fall off the bone ribs and having a couple of beers.  A portion of the bad experience can be faulted towards other customers - screaming (like bloody murder) kids, parents who ignored them and a much older guy who kept staring and inching his chair closer to our table.  Eww.   But I digress.  I'm here to talk about the food and service.  After finally being seated (because of the football crowd), we waited for 10 minutes at our table before anyone even acknowledged we were there.  Then we ordered our food... which we waited... and waited for.  When it finally came, the ribs were fatty and barely warm. The fries were cold but the ranch dressing was good.  The garlic bread could have been used to replace a roof tile. To round it out, the zucchini was fair to middlin.  The beers were not that cold... so that couldn't even save the day.  We left before halftime - and to you other sports fans out there - you know it had to be bad!  While the restaurant cannot control who walks in their doors, they can provide good food and proper service.  Bad on them....  disappointing."}
{"text":"Three of us went here last week because the locally owned restaurant where we wanted to eat was closed that night for a private party. I think we arrived around 8PM. We might as well have been invisible. No one even acknowledged us for the first 10 minutes. When the server finally came to our table, she hardly knew anything about the drink menu or the food menu. It said 'taco Tuesday' on one of the lists at our table, with no explanation as to what that meant. Turns out you get 3 tacos for some reduced rate. Can you have one of each kind?\" The server didn't know. We ordered drinks while waiting for her to find out. Fully 10 minutes later she brought water to my mom, but no drinks to us. We had just about decided to have our drinks and just go without dinner when she finally brought our drinks and took our food order. The drinks were expensive and definitely nothing special. Twenty minutes later our food came. The only reason I've given two stars is the food was really good. My sister and I split the broiled fish which was delicious. We also split the sweet potato fries which were crispy on the outside and still creamy on the inside. Mom really liked her Rueben sandwich too and took 1/2 of it home.  We all agreed we won't be wasting our time going to this place again."}
{"text":"It's sometimes the little things that matter. This could have been a 4 star review. But... I went here with two friends to a fundraiser for Arizona Dog Adoptions. Gallaghers was donating 20% of all food purchases to the rescue. My friends and I had a very positive experience, and will gladly go back if given another reason. That being said, there were a couple of things I feel compelled to point out. When serving drinks, small bar napkins would be nice. I squeezed the lime into my drink, and then had nowhere to wipe my fingers. Putting side vegetables in a little cup reminds people of middle school cafeteria food. Bar nachos should never have convenience store cheese sauce on them. If you're a bar, check on drink status please? When charging extra for celery, either mention it beforehand, or at least give more than a stalk and a half.  The positives? The Tilapia was cooked PERFECTLY. Their margaritas aren't from a gross mix! The mozzarella sticks were shockingly good. My Bloody Mary was delicious. And, did I mention that the staff was very nice?"}
{"text":"I went for lunch today and thought it was pretty good! The sweet potato fries were awesome though, I'd give them an extra half star if there was the option. There was also this weird raspberry jelly stuff that was tasty - try it on the fries for something different.  It's a typical sports bar with a million TVs so if that's your thing you'll love this place. Me, notsomuch into sports, but for a nice sit down lunch this place is a good value for money. The service was good, the bathrooms were clean and they split the check without any complaints."}
{"text":"Any place that offers sweet potato fries is worth remembering, in my book.  Their seasoned fries are also outstanding!  I've ordered a veggie burger here twice, and, I must say, they've done a great job!  All accomodations have been made, when I have special requests like extra cheese or extra pickles on my veggie burger.  The service has always been prompt and wonderful in my visits.  It's always busy here, it seems, but that never seems to slow down the food making its way to our table.  It takes long enough for me to know it's being cooked to order, but it's fast enough to make it to my mouth before any complaints have made it out.  ;o)"}
{"text":"Stephanie the bartender, seems to always be there when I am...consistently takes 20 minutes to even approach you. She is not friendly. Management is never around and the young black woman who is always managing is no peach herself. Good luck with the service. Too bad cause the food is great...best bet is takeout or not at all."}
{"text":"This place is good to have a beer and catch a game but stay clear of the food.  It's isn't even decent bar food.  Ordered a salad wedge and it was really bad.  Half a head of lettuce cut in half mixed with bacon and blue cheese - very weak.  Fried fish on Fridays was frozen and pretty bad.  You clearly do not come to a place like this for food but these guys don't even try to serve decent stuff.  Drink your beer and head to jack in the box."}
{"text":"The table was dirty. The server was ditching us constantly she obviously hates working on Sunday's. I'm glad to say the service was way below standard I felt ignored, another server had to come by. Thanks. This place has definitely changed the past few years that I've been coming here. Come on Gallaghers, check your yelp reviews and start getting things back to order."}
{"text":"I have been a regular four the last three years. When ever I am in town on Sunday I always stop in for breakfast. I sit at the bar where Wendy always has. a big smile. They take great care of me Stacey always check in to make sure all is good. I recommend Gallaghers to any one."}
{"text":"A local spot... big dining room, which is good if you have a big group or kids.  The servers are pretty good.  The food is fairly good and priced well.  I like the pulled pork sandwich or the Gallagher's salad.  My daughter likes the bbq chicken wrap (grilled chicken), and my husband likes their burgers (the Santa Fe burger is pretty good, according to him).  Get the seasoned fries or pay extra for the sweet potato fries - good!  If you're really hungry, get the ribs - always good.  Ask the server what the special is - they don't really advertise them and they have one every night - sometimes they are really good deals!  Oh, don't get the cookie thing for dessert - it's always raw in the middle (gross).   I would recommend this place for a casual dinner spot."}
{"text":"Nice people and good sports atmosphere,  but food quality is very low. No real flavors or special items. The server was very friendly accomodating so service was great."}
{"text":"Gross is all I can say.  We don't have a lot of choices in Cave Creek, so we figured we couldn't go wrong with a couple sandwich orders.  Wrong!  My sliders were charred around the edges, which left a terrible after-taste.  My husband ordered the cod sliders and said they were ok.  However, they charge for pickle slices???!!!  No thanks!  Terrible service and food!"}
{"text":"Decent place, great for daytime drinking... you can meet all of the other alcoholics and feel accepted, without having it feel like a 12 step meeting.    Server was a bit surly, food took way too long, and daytime prices weren't exactly much in the way of specials.  Food alright.  Beer selection above average for places like this, and this Gallaghers had much less skank feel than the Union Hills/7th location.  Good parking."}
{"text":"Off-track betting lounge place with all of the traditional atmosphere such places have.  Reminds me of bowling alley bars too.   Daytime drinking alcoholic?  This is your place.  Do beer after beer in the morning and I doubt anyone would raise an eyebrow.  Oddly enough, they have few Bud/Miller/Coors options on draft, and quite a few craft beer drafts.  Blue collar place for sure, if you didn't surmise that already."}
{"text":"Upon entering you can notice it is a large, clean sports bar with a very good amount of televisions. Seating is self serve.  I waited a bit longer than I like to get the attention of a server, and had to flag one down, but after doing so, got immediate and fast service. The place was packed.  The food never fails to be pleasing. It is all the usual bar food, so do not expect anything but bar food. Along those guidelines: it is top shelf.  The have daily deals every day, as well as early bird and late night deals. Taco Tuesday, Wing Wednesday, Thursday Trivia, big fat fish frydays; and so on.  I may be biased slightly since it is in walking distance of my home, but I would recommend the location.  Edit: I changed my rating from a 4 to 3 star because of service. I was willing to accept the fact that we got lost at first in the busy shuffle, but when it came time to take care of the check, I had to get up and find someone to process our check so we could leave. Waiting 20 minutes is unacceptable."}
{"text":"First and last time I will come here I waiting 45 minutes and no one acknowledges us. No one even bothered to get our order. I walked out it was so bad. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"If I could give this location a 0 star rating I would.  I've gone to Gallagher's in Chandler and off of 16th St, both those locations were fine (food, service, atmosphere). But one day after my daughter was born I had recently moved into the area and decided to go there.  I was harassed by the patrons for bringing my daughter into the restaurant part and then the staff members didn't really do anything.  So I told the patron off and never went back again.  Poor staff, worse patrons."}
{"text":"My favorite boneless wings in the valley with the Bourbon Glaze of course.  They used to have awesome shoestring fries but now they are just the thick steak ones ... that makes me sad.  Oh well, now i just get the wings and a salad.  The turkey melt is awesome as well.  Fun to go for happy hour now and again... Not impressed with the burgers - as long as I stick to my favorites, they keep their four stars ... otherwise would probably drop to 3."}
{"text":"I ordered their wings for lunch and it was delicious. Great service and wings for a decent price. I will come back here for lunch again."}
{"text":"I've stopped in Gallagher's a time or two in the past year.  What a nice sports bar.  Tons of TVs all around.  The outside patio is always packed and a lot of TVs out there too.  I absolutely think this is a fantastic place to go watch a game.    I wouldn't go here if you're looking for anything that resembles fine dining.  This is strictly bar food.  There's nothing exciting to mention about the food at all and I've pretty much stopped eating there and will only have a drink when I go there with the occasional order of fries.  I like their martini menu.  They have these cute sweet martini's for 6 bucks.  They also have 4 Peaks Kiltlifter on tap and some other local beers.  What makes me come back from time to time on Saturday nights?  The karaoke.  There is a little lady that comes on Saturdays who wears her cowboy hat and sings her country music.  Then, there's me.  The country loving black girl with the big curly afro who gets up and murders a Gretchen Wilson song!  Oh, just murder the song.  Poor song has died a million deaths at my hand, I'm sure.  If you are on that side of town, perhaps staying at the Legacy down the street, you will find that this place is AWESOME for catching a game while you're in town on vacation.  50% of the times I've gone here was a game night and the place was packed with people, particularly that patio and the bar.  Great for a late night drink too."}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer and maybe watch a game. The chips, salsa and Guacamole are excellent. Adilene is incredible! She definitely cares about providing world class customer service!"}
