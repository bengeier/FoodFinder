{"text":"Best sushi ! Never fails! Quality is #1 and make sure you get a loyalty card = free sushi ! Best price & quality for what you can get on the Plateau. Perfect for a quick fix lunch or dinner. Get the Mexican, mini-kami, rainbow...they're all great."}
{"text":"Really like this place! We went as a group of 4. service was great and since i really like sashimi i was really happy that they have resonable prices for only sashimi plates :) It is usually hard to find"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery the other day and was really happy with  my choice. The sushi was fresha nd delicious, the prices are decent  and the delivery was fast. (20-25 mins)  Ill be orderng from the, again :)   They have a a few vegetariamn and vegan choices which is great too."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!  Very fresh and the best sushi delivery in Montreal.  Tons of choices, and very reasonable prices.  They also give bonus free sushi if you order over a certain amount!"}
{"text":"The price is really good. The food is really fresh. The place offers delivery. You get a $10 discount for every hundred dollars you buy there (If I'm not mistaken). And To make things even better, they actually have a picture menu for all the sushi they have which is great for those who are visual like me and love to see what they're going to eat prior to ordering their food. Couldn't ask for more! I love this place and I strongly recommended it."}
{"text":"Excellent rapport qualité-prix. Je suis allée dans des restaurants de sushi considérés plus huppés et la qualité n'étais pas a la hauteur de Ichi Sushi. Les sushis sont frais, bien roulés et surtout il n'y a pas trop de riz - ce qui sous-entend que les employés ajoutent plus d'ingrédients autres. Bref, une place sans prétention; beau bon pas cher."}
{"text":"C'est mangeable, sans plus. Ça ne goûte pas particulièrement frais. Et puis le personnel n'est pas des plus sympathiques... Surtout quand on compare au wawa à côté, où les employés sont toujours souriants!"}
{"text":"Waited for an hour. We did a sit down for food. They decided to pack it and set it and forget it.   I would only suggest this place if you have no choice, Montreal is vast and there's a lot of restos."}
{"text":"Les sushis ne sont ni bons ni mauvais....rien de particulier ou d'original! C'est une place correcte pour commander des sushis à emporter quand on a plus rien au frigo et une flemme extrême pour aller faire des courses!  Croyez-en mon expérience! Il ne faut pas vous attendre à de la grande cuisine....les associations de saveurs ne sont pas uniques ni surprenantes et la qualité est juste correcte!  Un petit conseil...préférez utiliser votre propre sauce soja car j'ai trouvé la leur pas très fine ou peut être trop diluée.... Un point est sur en tout cas c'est que vous ne mangerez pas pour cher...en effet les prix sont vraiment bon marché!  Est ce pour ça que la qualité/originalité laisse à désirer?!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a takeout review, no clue about the quality of the dine in restaurant, which is why I've given it a 2 star rating. Takeout experience definitely a 1.   Once we ordered sushi from here and it was ok. The second time we ordered, the sushi was so old, it had obviously been made the day before. The rice was gluey and cold. The fish was rubbery and fishy tasting. We couldn't eat our sashimi without choking on the rice. Even the pickled ginger was limp and chewy... No way the entire platter wasn't premade, which we shouldn't have received for $87.    I'm thinking that the first time we were lucky and got a relatively fresh plate, but this time was terrible.   The sushi that I did eat, because I was ravenous, gave me stomach issues. There is better sushi for the same price. No way I would order from here again."}
{"text":"I discovered it with a friend a bit more than a year ago and since I can't stop going there... You definitely shall try the Tayo and Ocean. If you like seafood, you gotta try the Seafood Miso deliciously fresh. The sauvage Octopus was the only thing in their menu that I don't like, too spicy and chewy..."}
{"text":"This is definitely a half decent sushi takeout place. Do not expect to walk in and be teleported to Japan! It's good... It isn't great. But if fairly inexpensive sushi takeout is what you're looking for, this might be your place!"}
{"text":"great place for pick up. sushi is fresh. I love the ichiban thing. As well as the tartare. They often give some free hosomaki. And the price is fair."}
{"text":"Delicieux. Toujours frais. Pas dispendieux comparé à d'autres endroits. Sushis reguliers mais aussi une belle gamme de sushis originaux. Je fais le detour de 20min juste pour en avoir. SVP ne changez pas votre politique d'entreprise ou vos recettes.  PS: mon chum et moi aimons beaucoup les Ichiban (tres grosse portion) et les patsu !!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi here. Hidden gem at the corner of mont royal and saint Laurent. Great place for a quick bite or take out. Walking distance to the mountain where you can sit and enjoy quality sushi.  I've been going quite often to this place and always a pleasure. Service is friendly and the portions are fair. It's definitely a mouth full!  Amazing selection and great flavors. My favorite are the rolls with sweet potatoes and Fuji apples.  If you don't eat real crab they are more then happy to replace it. Just ask!  The fish is always fresh and never got sick.  I would highly recommend this place and if you do go often they have a sushi card to help save a few dollars. Already for what you get the price is fair and worth it."}
{"text":"Sushi in Montreal is expensive (but where is it not when I'm still comparing it to west coast prices!?) and despite being a rather unimpressively decored little mint green box (blaring Mandarin pop), Ichi Sushi is no exception. Thankfully though, if the craving hits and you've got somewhere nice to go al fresco, the sushi here is pretty good.   Beside a large number of regular and chef special makis and the to-be-expected a la carte nigiri and sashimi options, Ichi also has refreshing tartares and rice paper rolls. The menu layout of makis by size (small, medium, and large), is also different and caters to diners with varying appetite sizes and preferences for variety."}
{"text":"Within steps from a popular corner of Mont-Royal and St. Laurent there lays an unassuming little sushi spot. Now, let me briefly explain how I luckily found it.  By chance that afternoon rain was about to fall, and as usual I forgot my umbrella (or lost it). Thankfully, I saw a place close by with a simple fish shape for a sign. I figured they served some sort of Japanese fare, as a large sushi menu was placed in the lower left window corner.  Taking shelter from the passing showers seemed a good time for a mid afternoon snack, so I surveyed the interior of the small but welcoming shop.   They have an open fridge with some ready-made sushi plates, wraps and salads plus a selection of cold beverages. They offer free hot water and green tea bags, but usually beside a hot tea a cold drink is enjoyable with Japanese fare (not that day with the chill from the rain).   The owner happened to be behind the counter (with a sushi chef to his left who was very focused on the tasks at hand). He happily explained the new promotional one page double-sided menu sheet (with most rolls named for towns in France). One simply called \"salmon avocado\" caught my eye.   It turned out the avocado was extremely rich and tasty, as I found out they are proud to serve very fresh avocado. Totally 5 stars for that ingredient (on that day), and it typically blends well with fresh salmon among other things. I got a little container of spicy mayo for dipping on the side, which was well balanced.  I sat at their clean bleached wood finished tables. The décor on the whole looked fresh, simple and had a nice amount of Asian decorative wall hangings - including the requisite golden lucky cat on a shelf in the corner.  They have a larger double-sided menu, which would make for much more than a snack. Perhaps for take-out, party platter or delivery another time.  It's good to know there are still well established local sushi places in and around Montreal's city corners - especially nearby a historic \"Main\" one."}
{"text":"Ordered from this restaurant many many times and got used to their late deliveries. Put up with it because the sushi was fresh and good for the price. However, they recently lost us as customers because of a bad experience.   We waited over an HOUR AND 45mins. By the time the sushi came it was freezing cold and the rice has hardened. The deliver man was very nice and called the restaurant for us because we requested a discount for this subpar experience and quality. The restaurant declined, knowing that we wouldn't pay 50$ for frozen sushi.  Our dinner party ended up ordering a pizza (which came within 25 mins)."}
{"text":"Francais plus bas We had a little get together with friend at work and order large plates of Sushi of all kind from Ichi Sushi. At the beggining I was quite worried. The last time my employer had bought some, it felt like eating a sushi with overcooked rice, no seasoning, bad product. Enough to make you stop eating sushi for 1 month. However this place is definetily ok. Good bargain and great variety too. It is Sushi on the Cheap side of sushi so you can't expect nothing more than average   On a commandé un plateau de sushi au boulot pour célébré puis je ne mentirais pas que j'avais très peur d'avoir les mêmes sushis que la dernière fois il nous avait apporté. Je parle bien sur de sushi avec le riz trop cuit, les assaisonnements dégeux genre de la sauce soya VH hyper salé qui tue toutes forme de goût . C'est semblable à la compétition sushiman et kanda je dirais mais c'était pas mal bien comme endroit. Je parle dans la catégorie du beau bon pas cher, c'est vraiment bien. Mais c'est sur que c'est effectivement moyen!"}
