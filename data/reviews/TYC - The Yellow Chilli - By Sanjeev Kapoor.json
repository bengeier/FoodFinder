{"text":"I literally just waited 40 minutes for takeout.  There was two other tables in the restaurant.   If they would have told me I was going to wait that long (they said ten minutes) I would have left.   Even if this mea is delicious I still have an incredibly sour taste in my mouth.  And for 65 dollars for two curries and three nann I doubt it will be worth it.  Opening week failure BIG TIME.  Update:   The nann was paper thin and crunchy.  The  food was not worth the price.  Don't do it.   Not even an apology for the appalling service."}
{"text":"Ordered through delivery services - Karahi Paneer was floating in oil and assorted basket of rotis only had plain naan, butter naan and tandoori roti! Assorted basket has all the breads on the menu. Very disappointed this time, previously when we went to the restaurant food was better - less oily and was as per the menu."}
{"text":"We came here to try it out and were pleasantly surprised. The lunch special was a good size, and very flavorful. Didn't try anything a la carte, but for our first time there, we were very happy with it."}
{"text":"Website says they open on Saturdays at 11am but the door was locked till 12.10pm. No one answered the phone either. Menu looked good but given their poor work ethic, did not get to try it. If they are so irresponsible with basic things, I can imagine the slack with food preparation."}
{"text":"A nice little Indian place at Yonge and Eglinton. Charming decor with a warm atmosphere greeted us as we were seated promptly. The menu had a large number of options and their lunch specials we're all great. (Something for everyone, great for vegetarians) The service was a little lacking but not for the servers efforts, I think they were just understaffed. The servers were trying but we waited a long time after eating to get our bill and even for our order to be taken. I had the mutton Biryani and the portions were fairly large and the flavours were delicious.  The lamb was a bit on the dry side and not quite as tender as I had hoped. My friends really enjoyed their tikki masala.  Overall, it was not bad and probably is one of the better Indian places nearby (or at least according to my Indian friends) and was good for lunch."}
{"text":"The legitimacy of this review comes from a lifetime of living in Scarborough - I know my Indian cuisine.  While there's a little bit of sticker shock at these prices, the food is very good and not too greasy.  The vegetarian stand out is definitely the Shaam Savera, the koftas were so very delicious although there were only 4, sadly!  The Lalla Mussa Dal was very flavourful but the Sarson Ka Saag, even though it packed the most heat, was a little lacking compared to the other dishes.  This is a nice treat for something different from the pub fare in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered via Skip the Dishes.  The menu was kind of confusing for some people as dishes don't have adequate descriptions.  I had to Google some item to get a better idea of what they are.  In addition, the spinach and paneer dumplings had too much sauce to the number of dumplings (only four!!!!!) and I was a little surprised that the kids' butter chicken and rice came already premixed.  I assumed that it would be separate because some kids prefer to eat things separately (yet want their own foo).  I DID enjoy the tandoori broccoli and the avocado salad."}
{"text":"I placed my order thru Skipped the dishes- ordered the Chicken Biryani and the Lawrence Ave Tandoori chicken. I had asked for some red onions and some raita on the side. A few minutes later I get a call from a rep from skipped the dishes to advise me that the restaurant contacted them-and that if I would like some onions on the side the charge will be $3.   This made my blood boil- The biryani is $15 and half a chicken is $15, which I feel I paid a premium price. This is part of a global chain and I would expect some standards for their staff meet. To go thru the trouble of contacting the courier and telling them there is surcharge is so petty It made me question if the management in the restaurant are confused? if maintaining the prestige higher tiered status is less important than  offering a paying customer some slices of onion. I can go to McDonalds and buy a $2 sandwich and ask for free onions but I get charged in a premium restaurant? I request to cancel the order but the skipped the dishes rep told me that it was too late. I don't know if TYC knows that it is in the same neighborhood as some amazing Indian Food with top notch service like :  1) Great Maratha 2) Banjara's 3) Copper Chimney  All 3 premium Indian restaurants in close proximity who can cater to similar needs.   Aside from the service end and just pettiness. I will not take away from the quality of their food. I was sort of already expecting some cheap quality, low in meat ration just from the experience I had about some extra onions.  However the food was delicious. Lots of meat in the biryani with amazing spices. The tandoori had a kebab like taste to it which was fantastic and was accompanied with a great salad with mango dressing.   If management is reading- how much do a few slices of onion really cost? spoil your customer's in love and they will return with their friends and family."}
{"text":"Ordered prawn curry which was excellent. Beef vindaloo was not the best. Naan was a bit dry and hard to eat. The food was extremely oily. We had to drain the excess oil out before eating. Used a groupon- I would go back for the prawn curry. Good service."}
{"text":"Tried The Yellow Chilli tonight. First and LAST time we will be going here. Two chicken dishes ordered - butter chicken and the creamy chicken tikka dish. Both dishes had so much gristle and fat that each mouthful of food had to be spat out. So tired of paying good money ($16 and $17 per dish and the chicken tikka portion was quite meagre) for rubbish food. When I called to complain, the manager told me that next time I should ask for white meat (!) and apparently some people like the fat, gristle and bones in their food. After asking why isn't everyone served food that doesn't need to be spat out, he reiterated that some people don't mind pieces of meat that literally cannot be cut with a table knife and to ask for the white meat. I took our food back and asked for a refund. Anyone reading this, save your money and go to Indian Street Food Co. When will Yonge/Eglinton get some decent Indian food?!"}
{"text":"I have been passing the restaurant and always noticed high prices compared to other Indian restaurants. I thought it would be a good time to try it when they introduce lunch specials as they were more affordable. So today I went and wanted to order one veggie/one meat and rice combo. Well I was told there is no special for that today, I had to go for a veggie and veggie special. All I wanted is Channa Masala and butter chicken with rice. So I decided to get their butter chicken only lunch special. I told the waiter that I wanted it with rice. 2 minutes later I go and pay, and he punched in naan instead and he had to run to the kitchen to correct it. Now the food. The rice was a good portion and the butter chicken not bad for the price of 10.99. That's where it stops. The chicken was too chewy, the sauce not as thick as I'm used to. And it looks like this restaurant is adapted to Canadian taste, not being spicy at all. For the prices they still charge for normal diners, not sure it's great value. And the confusion on which day I can order a specific lunch combo is baffling. I got the impression that the specific waiter had no clue what is what."}
{"text":"I'm from Europe and very picky with customer service as well as food... I have to rate this brand new restaurant since it is far from what I was expecting... - Service: very good, great and attentive waiters, polite and efficient  - Food: amazing. I didn't expect such a good cuisine, the garlic bread is delicious, as the rest of our dinner - Environment: clean and pretty restaurant   stars well deserved, some other Indian restaurants should take the TYC as an exemple, because before this, my experiences with Indian restaurants was mediocre."}
{"text":"So I've been here a couple times and also did a full size blog praising The Yellow Chilli and how I felt it was one of the better Sanjeev Kapoor restaurants. But last night at TYC changed everything. I take back my words and possibly also going to edit my blog.   The chicken that we ordered (lazeez murgh) was extremely dry and chewy. I've had the other chicken dishes earlier and felt the same thing. Too dry. It was totally overcooked to the point where the pieces had shrunk. We sent the chicken back and the manager who also calls himself a chef gets all defensive and says that it's dry cos the pieces are breast pieces.   One advice on cooking:  maybe next time use a whole chicken or cook with the skin on. Go boneless and skinless, and you're basically asking for a dry, stringy piece of meat.  Another piece of advice: maybe next time accept your mistake, say sorry and try to correct it instead of getting defensive and giving lame excuses.   That was not the first excuse of the night. When we asked him to get use garlic naan instead of the Pyaaz Mirch ki Roti cos the roti was too hard to chew, he responded saying that is because we let the roti get cold before eating.   Forget correcting their mistake, at the end of the night when I had to pay for the meal I see that I was charged full price for having literally two bite size pieces of chicken and also the roti.  EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK"}
{"text":"Okay guys, I have been here twice before, and was disappointed... So I went back after more than 1 year to give them a chance to redeem themselves.  Masala papad: Two cold pappadums sprinkled with seasoned salt, a little bit of diced supermarket tomato and red onion. All I could taste was salt. ($4.95)  Pindi chana masala (chick peas): Didn't really have much flavour.  Definitely not an authentic North Indian dish. ($13.95)  Meet Moilee (coconut fish curry): How do I describe this? The tilapia was chewy (most likely frozen). The sauce was insipid and had a strange, gloopy consistency. It just didn't taste very nice. ($21.00)  I ate a few bites and left the rest. I said, \"Look, to be honest, it wasn't very good.\"  ... Utter silence.  The bill came. With a glass of juice, tax and 15% tip, I was charged: $56.00.  I hope this helps someone. TOFTT"}
{"text":"I recently purchased a Groupon voucher for takeout/delivery, as well as one for dining in (set menu). For takeout, I would rate them lower than dining in, as you don't get to experience the ambiance, so you are rating solely on the food. The impact to my wallet felt more noticeable on the takeout order, as I've had Indian food that has been just as good, at a much lower cost. However, the restaurant itself was really nice, the service was great and the food presentation was fantastic. I enjoyed every dish, with the exception of the Naan bread, as it dries out so very quickly (removed one star for this - naan is basic and should be perfect in a \"fine dining\" Indian restaurant)  For my takeout order, I had the Garlic Naan ($3.95), Appetizer Mixed Platter ($13.00), Nalli Rogan Josh ($21.00) and Dum Gosht Biryani ($17.00). The food didn't take long to arrive, so that was a plus. However, after opening the food containers, I was a little dismayed to see the portion sizes and presentation for the amount they charge. The naan was a decent portion, but it was very thin in the middle, and it dried out to the consistency of a cracker - it literally snapped when I broke a piece off. It wasn't sitting out for a long time, either, this happened as it was sitting on my plate while I ate my dinner. The outer edges were ok, but a big waste when the whole thing should've been like that. Soft and tender, not dried out and crunchy.  The appetizer platter consisted of 2 pieces of paneer, four mushrooms and two pieces of broccoli, covered in some type of sauce. Really? For $13? Not worth it. The Rogan Josh was delicious, but again, the portion was very small for $21.00. The Biryani was the highlight of the meal, as the lamb was very tender and had excellent flavour. At $17, it's a tad pricey, but I felt this dish was worth it, as there was a decent amount of lamb in there.   For dine in, we had a set menu (Groupon price of about $56) consisting of the following (plus butter naan & jasmine rice):   Starters: Tomato basil soup, Papads, green salad. The soup, I thought was a strange addition for an Indian restaurant, but it was nice.   Appetizer: Chapata Wings - I thought these were really good. Spicy, flavourful and cooked very well.   Mains:  1) Pindi Chana Masala - loved this dish - I was never a fan of chickpeas until I tried them in an Indian restaurant years ago, and now I love them. I would definitely order this again.  2) Butter chicken - really velvety texture to the sauce. One of the better butter chicken dishes I've tried.  3) Rarha Bhuna Gosht - Lamb & Mutton curry dish - this was my favourite dish of the evening. The lamb was very tender and the sauce was so good. I wish we'd had some leftover for my lunch the next day!   Dessert: Gulab Jamun - served warm with pistachios sprinkled on top. Delicious.  Bottom line: I see this restaurant as more of a \"special occasion\" spot due to the high prices. If they offered a discount for takeout, I would gladly order again, but can't justify the price otherwise. There are plenty of good Indian restaurants in the area for good takeout."}
{"text":"Sanjeev Kapoor is a big brand name for Indian cuisine. Visiting this place means you are signing up for some real differentiated food and  a great service. You come here with expectations and obviously have a standard that the food needs to match up to. The good news : Yes, the food is nice, ambience is awesome and the staff is friendly. The sad news: There are a few better Indian restaurants in the GTA (not near this one though) that beats this place hands down on service, ambience and food. We were the only ones in the restaurant that evening and it took them for ever to prepare the food. Service is incredibly slow. Also, I am not sure why they would play some punjabi dance music for that ambience - just did not go with it. I thought some nice melodious bollywood music would do the trick. The folks are also worried about any additional ask. We asked for some raita and also some onions. We were immediately told that it would cost us extra (LOL!). I'll give it a 4 star given it has a Sanjeev Kapoor brand and the food was different. I am hoping that they will address some of their teething problems as they operationalize the restaurant and live up to Sanjeev Kapoor's fame."}
{"text":"Went there with few friends of mine while visiting Toronto from California, loved everything about this place the infrastructure , warm welcome by staff and the best part the food was perfectly cooked and served timely, living in San Francisco this kinda restaurant seems like a Michelin contender in near future, thank you for making our visit memorable TYC."}
{"text":"Tried go there for lunch on a Sunday Website said they closed at 3:00 pm and we got there at 2:45 pm to find that all the tables were cleared. The host said that they close at 2:30 pm and were about to change the website (rather indifferently) Drove uptown and paid for parking, not sure if I'll be back bc of the flippant manner in which we were treated"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant; amazing service and delicious food! I was served by Isma and she was absolutely wonderful! The meals are unique and very tasty. Also the serving sizes are very decent. I highly recommend trying the chaats."}
{"text":"Service isn't good, they are so slooow! However it is the best Indian restaurant that I have tried in Toronto. I loved everything I tried. I had the Shabnam ke Moti- mushroom filled with cheese as appetizer, I had the garlic naan and the Lalla Mussa Dal which is 36h slow cooked lentils. But I also tried from my friends the Gosht Saagwaa which is lamb spinach curry (or some other greens) it was the most delicious curry and tried and the Puran Singh - chicken curry also so good. The we go complimentary desert, the rice cardamom pudding, kulfi ice cream and some type of warm cake. I loved the rice pudding it's sugar free but still tastes sweet. I'll come back hopefully service is faster."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! We enjoyed every single dish. Our favourite was the Shaam Savera, it's a must-try. The Shabnam Ke Moti was a bit spicy (the menu did mention this) and the waiter was so nice to keep bringing water and even mango lassi for us! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"When TYC opened in my neck of the woods, I was happy to see another Indian option but I had no idea that it was a worldwide brand with locations all over the globe.  So when a Groupon promising an incredible amount of food for a reasonable price came along, I just couldn't resist.  We started off with a Tomato Basil Soup and a Green Salad. The soup was actually pretty mind-blowing. Its flavors are so beyond what you expect from a tomato soup that it's pretty ridiculous. The Green Salad was actually much, much more interesting than its name implies, as it also boasts a variety of interesting Indian-themed flavors. (I should note that the dressing is mango-infused, which we never would have known had my mango-allergic dining companion not asked.)  (The Groupon also lists the appetizer course as including Papads, which we did not receive.)  For our mains, we picked the following three options: Pindi Chana Masala, Chowringee Chilli Chicken, and Lamb Vindaloo. The Masala and Vinadaloo were both among the best versions of these venerable dishes I've ever had, and the Vindaloo was especially quite flavorful and spicy. The Chilli Chicken, on the other hand, was baffling. It tasted like a mediocre adaptation of a Chinese dish. There was nothing about it that stood out or was terribly interesting. I have no idea why this was an option, but it absolutely should not have even been on the menu. (It would be like seeing Spaghetti Bolognese on the menu at a Mexican joint.)  For dessert, we each received a small bite of Gulab Jamun. Though the portion was awfully tiny, it actually turned out to be pretty perfect. And again, this was probably the best version of this dish I've ever had.  I'll definitely be eating at TYC more often, but I will certainly stay far, far away from the Chowringee Chilli Chicken."}
{"text":"The place is nice and clean, the servers are kind and helpful. I really liked the food, it's one of the best Indian food that I had tried in Toronto. Some meals comes a big portion, lots of food, yeeeeey! Sometimes the food take a little long because they make it fresh, but it worth. The desserts are amazing, maybe my favourites!"}
{"text":"Great, authentic Indian food and the restaurant has a good atmosphere.  Menu is varied with good choices and we haven't had a disappointing meal to date.  Biriyani is tasty albeit a bit spicier than I tend to like but they are happy to adjust dishes to suit.  I was not overly keen on the samosa's I had once - the filling was scarce within the pastry. That said, the Rogan Josh Lamb Shank and the Lalla Mussa Dal (a house specialty) are both delicious - lots of flavor and in the case of the dal a tasty, creamy texture.  Service here is decent.   It is a bit on the pricey side so in terms of value it's 'ok' but we're happy to spend if we have a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Terrific experience.  Service was excellent and food was superb.  One of the best dining experiences here so far."}
{"text":"We asked the server to recommend a few drinks from the signature menu and she said \"I don't like any of them.\" Kind of awkward moment.  We would ask for things and the servers would forget or it took so long to get it.  Or the server would come back after a long time and ask \"you ordered.... right?\"  The food is ok, there was one item we ordered that we could not digest and asked if we can just get a plain nann in replacement and the server said no and offered to smear butter all over it to hide the weird taste.  At the end of the meal another server gave us the bill and kept telling us the bill doesn't include tip so be sure to tip.  Kind of awkward when the service wasn't good."}
{"text":"1st weird thing. My friend ordered the Indian Mule cocktail which is vodka with ginger beer and lime. They brought him a brown drink and right away we knew something was up. First sip reveals it's made with Root beer!!. When we complained the server said they don't have ginger beer in Canada. So they make it with root beer?? Tasted crazy sweet and also definitely didn't have any lime. Then it was just awkward silence and my friend had to say he didn't want it and wanted something else.  Masala fries were super bland and very over priced for what they are. We tried the potato wedge ones. They did not bring any sauce and we had to ask for some. I do not recommend this dish. $14.00 for bland potatoes.   The mains were much much better. We tried the black daal and mixed veg dish (has paneer in it even though not listed in the description). Both were quite good.  The person next to us must have been very special, the kitchen staff came out five or six times to speak to her and the servers kept mentioning that her dishes were complimentary.  After she paid she was brought a free dessert. It made us feel weird, all this attention this woman got in comparison to the service we received which was mediocre."}
{"text":"First of all I always look for good food and service, no mater how the ambience is. This one had a good ambience but food and service was pathetic. We had ordered butter Roti and butter naan which were good along with panner ki sabzi and black daal which were tasteless and no salt or masala. I am use to eating food which is medium spicy and with great flavours. Both weren't there in the food. The service was also slow was turtle,we ordered for 2 diet cokes which came in after we told 3 different people to get it because at the first place we didn't get it. The starters had no taste and no flavours. I just wanted to pay and leave. I got stomach ache when I left the restaurant. I expected good flavoured food,but didn't get it. I thought it's  Sanjeev Kapoor restaurant,its going to be good,but it was so pathetic I couldn't even swallow the food. I don't  recommend this place.JUST DONT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT. THIS LOCATION IS AT YONGE AND EGLINTON TORONTO,ONTARIO"}
{"text":"I WISH I HAD A WAY TO GIVE THEM A RATING IN NEGATIVE. I ordered two curries and they had no salt like literally no salt in it. I called them to tell them the same and this guy came back to me saying that we have added salt in it and maybe you eat more salt. Are you kidding me. I do understand whats no and less salt mean. The chana masala was horrible even when I added salt in it. The oil was so much in the curry and it was like they just prepared the food in a hurry. I would suggest noone to go this place."}
