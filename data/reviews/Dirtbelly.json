{"text":"Writing this review as I'm eating this for lunch and well, I'm highly disappointed. This was my first time trying dirt belly and it looked quite appealing to me as I walked by it so I decided to give it a shot. I ordered two salads, chicken, and one of those 'energy balls'. The salads are mediocre (I feel like Sunterra's are better) and the chicken is just disgusting! I don't really know how its cooked but it has absolutely no flavour and an odd texture. Would not go here again, not to mention that my total was $16!"}
{"text":"Since opening, I go to Dirt Belly at least once a week! The beet salad is my favorite, with the brussel sprouts coming in a close second. Price point is comparable with any fast food restaurant in the downtown core, but with the added bonus of being totally healthy! I have always had helpful, friendly service! They just need more locations!"}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding.  Want to try eating something with low GI load, protein-rich, vegan/vegetarian/pescatarian? Eat here.  Nothing like it in the core."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Menu of veggie based salads, love the ahi tuna baco, pretty good atmosphere. Had a salad with broccoli and Kale, and another with Beets and goat cheese. I wish they had more seating, was lunch and we took it back to the office. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place and really didn't hit the spot.   Had the three scoop of salads (curried cauliflower, chickpeas and almond, kale broccoli salad and basil pesto pasta salad. All were underwhelming. I also got the raspberry cardamom tealada. Sounds fancy but tastes just like any fountain drink from a bowling alley.   Looks hip and clean but wasn't delicious. I would try the salads at community naturals, those are way better."}
{"text":"Yes, the good is good and healthy. I'm a big fan of the cauliflower with chick peas and sultanas. But what prevents me from giving a higher rating is the price. $3.50 for a thin, 2\"-square slice of tuna? There are sushi places in town with about as much tuna for $1.50 and they obviously make money on it. And for the prices of the food, you'd think they'd warm it up in a microwave for a few seconds but no. So everything I've eaten in DB is cold. Another hipster food outlet that wants to recover their investment way too soon- too bad. How about creating a loyal following first with competitive pricing?"}
{"text":"Fantastic healthy addition to the food court however it can get extremely expensive fast. They charge per scoop for salad and protein so you can easily spend $15+ for a salad.  Everything is fresh and they do have some great drink options but it's not a place if you are on a budget or looking for an economical lunch. I have only tried them once so no idea what kind of items they would have for dinner?  This would'nt be a regular lunch for me because of the cost but it is good and a nice addition to the food court if you want really fresh and don't care about price."}
{"text":"Really glad to find a healthier option in a food court. I like Dirtbelly although it would be awesome if they could warm up your choice of protein - not fun to eat a 100% cold dish :)"}
{"text":"Expensive but good quality food. A bit salty but overall I felt good after my lunch. A nice alternative to the greasy stuff in the cafeteria."}
{"text":"Yes, I know DB tries to make things super nutritious, but since discovering the Naan Restaurant in Vancouver on 4th Avenue (Kitsilano), I've experienced such places as maxing our nutritional quality, but the taste is often so marginal as to eventually turn me off. Seems that in a burger I want the savour of good meat, and not some nutty thing that can be almost gross. Similar for Dirt Belly. It's located in a mall with a really good food court, but when I want nutrition in that mall, I bypass all the junk food pretenders and go to Bourbon or the other Wok Chinese places, who claim to not use MSG and other junk, and stock up on nicely cooked mixed vegetables and fish or chicken that has both flavour and quality.  Dirt Belly. I think a person has to want their stuff. Some of their offerings are quite good, but what can one do to an avocado or mixed rice dish that's not inherently in that kind of food already?"}
{"text":"First time trying dirt belly out. I must say I haven't had anything quite like this before. I was so impressed with the variety of options to try. I just wanted a scoop of everything! The concept is really unique! I had the curry cauliflower and yam quinoa.  I also had a falafel wrap topped with I think kale? Anyhow, it was very tasty! The best part about all of this, for once in a long time I actually felt good about buying lunch in  a shopping centre. Happy to see a healthier option for lunch!"}
{"text":"talk about moving money from my pocket to theres and getting nothing for it... awfull"}
{"text":"Tough Review.   I have been here two times in the last 2 weeks as I work next door. First was with excitement! Second was to see if the misses were just Opening pains....  Lets start with the positives.  I first order the make your own salad. Fairly decent portion for a 'food court' from the mix of kale/spinach/arugula. Then you can pick 4 add in's like peppers, mushroom, edamame beans etc. Then you can pick the dressing. To add on Chicken was $2.50 for half a half portion which really looked like a 1/3 of a chicken breast. And $5 for a full. (Apparently mini chickens). Same for avocado.  There is alot of options. And things are mostly labeled if you are avoiding dairy or gluten. So if you are on a bit of a January cleanse - chances are you can stay straight here.  My first salad experience - the people were great. The fella on cash was nice and chatty but not to chatty and I felt like it was a place I would easily become my fav. Plus the Jalape√±o Lemon dressing was outstanding.   Misses: My salad base was $13. With no avocado or or any protein.  Add ins were not that generous. Lettuce was ---but who really wants a bite of lettuce without a piece of pepper or chicken in the bite?? So final tally. $19.50 for base salad plus 1/2 chicken and 1/2 avo. Crazy small portion of chicken.   For $19.50 I might as well be at Earls or Township and have a waitress, a glass of wine and a seat not in a food court.   Other misses. Not enough dressing and only picking 4 items is not a lot.   Honestly though. The price is crazy steep. The base should include a protein or avo.   The 2nd time i tried it - glutton for punishment - i went with one of the 'premade type' selection that the ingredients are set. When she handed it to me I realized i essential have a bowl of kale.  So I handed it back and said, I should add Chicken to it. Knowing how little the portion was-  i said - sure a whole portion. Well then back at the cash and it was $19.50 again.  So. Im probably going back to Marcellos next week for a Power Bowl. Where I can add in unlimited toppings. Includes a protein AND an egg. (And cheese). And dressing. And its 7.99 or 9.99.   Anyways. It was a good try. Just need some menu and pricing revamps-in my opinion."}
{"text":"Literally one of the grossest places I've ever been to. The old lady manager is rude and not courteous to guests, the staff doesn't ever wear gloves nor do they wear hairnets. I've had hair in my food twice, and I've only eaten here twice.   Trust me, don't eat here."}
{"text":"My favorite kind of food is fresh and made from scratch. The food here offers you lots of these choices. They also happen to be pretty healthy choices which I should point out for those of you that like your grease and carbs of plenty. They have about a dozen different types of salads which you choose how many scoops of each you want. Then you can add protein to it in the form of grilled chicken, ahi tuna and so on. Everything looks very fresh and as though it was just made. It looks that way when I have been there I should say.   They also offer three flavors of lemonade. I always get blueberry mint. It comes with fresh mint leaves and is always very cold which I love. I have favorites when it comes to the salads. The edamame and tuna salad and the squash and kale are my favorites. I've tried three other kinds of salads and they weren't bad they just weren't my thing. The salads tend to be a little bland; I think they either under season them or don't put any sea salt in them.   Now you might be confused with how often I've been here and how I really enjoy the drink and salads I always get as to why I would give them only three stars. There is one specific employee or manager there that I find really rude every time he's there. The rest of the employees are very friendly and nice to talk too. They all have a really, really hard time with the scoop system that they use. You have to choose how many scoops of each salad you want and they have different scoop sized dishes. Every time I go it's different. I'll tell them I would like two scoop of each salad. It should be up to them to ask if the salads should all be in the same container or separate containers. Half the time they get out a huge container and start putting my salads in the same container without asking. Then I feel horrible but I have to have them separate because it usually takes me a few days to eat it and I don't like my flavors mixed. This seems to cause a huge confusion and they somehow can't add two and two anymore and I'll end up with one scoop of the first salad and three of the other or four of each and because of the way I am I just take it. I know two plus two is not difficult and at the beginning I say I would like two scoops of each salad so I know it's not my fault. It wouldn't be that big of a deal if it didn't happen every single time and if I didn't see it happen with other people. Plus this place is very expensive. Each scoop will cost you $3.50 and that adds up fast as the scoops are small.   The biggest and I believe extremely important complaint I have that in the end may cause me to stop going is the lack of work hygiene. Even subway puts on gloves just to scoop out soup into the soup cups. At dirtbelly I have never seen an employee wash their hands or put on gloves. They don't wear hairnets or at least hats with ponytails. I'm guessing they would argue it's because they don't touch any food but that's wrong. I've seen them touch the inside of the salad containers when they pick them up with their hands, touch the part of the lids that touch the food, they make your lemonade with their hands and the last time I went the man at the till stuck his entire bare hand inside the little bag he used tongs to put my coconut balls into. He handled money, credit cards, touched his face, the counter and God know what else and the stuck his hands inside the bag my food touched bare. I have been sick for almost ten years now with kidney and immune problems so stuff like that can be really dangerous to me. I was afraid to say anything because of the rude employee I mentioned from before so I paid for and took something that could kill me. I'm not exaggerating by the way. A regular persons hands can carry MERSA which can kill anyone on top of other things that would make me very ill. The answer to this complaint should not be for me to stop eating there because these things don't meet food and safety regulations for everyone. It should be them that changes. If they made a person ill or killed a person it could end their business let alone how horrible it would be for that to happen.   I would love to have written a long review on how amazing the food is here and hopefully one day I can. The health issues and inability to work their own scoop system has to be dealt with though."}
{"text":"It's just all right for me.  Personally, I think it's too pricey.  I had 2 scoops of different salads and it obviously did not stand out for me 'cos I can't remember what I had ordered now!"}
{"text":"Good food for food court. It is a great healthy alternative, although I do wish they had a vegan friendly protein alternative. I was bummed to find out the veggie patty had egg. The price can  accumulate quite fast, nonetheless still good."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this little place by mistake one day on my way through the +15s and going to a meeting downtown. Wandering the +15s is quickly becoming a favourite past time as there are so many great little finds like this.  So happy I took that wrong turn or I would have missed this little gem.  After my late morning meeting I came back and stopped in for a bite. I ordered a Tealada, salad + bread and spread (wicked avocado spread). I was seriously eye-balling the bacos but they were looking a little to big for my appetite. My entire meal was like $13 and very filling. Great deal for a down town stop.  They have several fresh salads to choose from and I've just recently learned they support local producers, which I love. More of a take out place, they only have a small table to sit at. Although there is more seating in the + 15 itself.  Friendly service and a busy little place (at least when I was there) i'm happy to hear a new location just opened in Market Mall."}
{"text":"First visit to Dirtbelly... and i really liked it. I've been trying to find an excuse to go visit the one located in the CORE for a while... but with the lack of free parking... wasn't worth it.  Having said that, the food at Dirtbelly looks so fresh, and clean. I should've taken a picture of the salad ingredients, but there was just so many choices! The salads are $3.5 a scoop with the option of adding seared ahi tuna or grilled chicken. I opted to get 4 scoops of salad... I don't remember what was in them... but I loved the one with the beets and also the butternut squash one! Both were super filling, and not overly oily.   I also got their Mango Kaffir Lime Tealada. It tasted like... a limeade, no mango flavor; which I didn't mind.. and it did make me smile like their description said :) Albeit... I was very scared I would end up eating their paper straw... Note to self: Paper straws are not made for straw biters.   I'm looking forward to trying out their cold pressed juices in the near future.  Definitely one of my favorite spots to hit up at Market Mall from here on out."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at the Dirtbelly at the CORE shopping mall, but I imagine the one in Market Mall is pretty similar. We tried a tuna \"baco\", a chicken baco, and a broccoli side, and all were very fresh and tasty. It was a pleasant surprise getting food this nice in a shopping mall food court.  Having said that, the food wasn't perfect. The baco bread was surprisingly, unforgivably tough and chewy. Both bacos were kinda skimpy on the protein. And, at the risk of being too nitpicky, the $8.50 bacos were a weird tweener size -- one baco isn't enough for a meal, but two is too much. I suppose the idea is that you order a baco and a couple of sides, which at $15 would end up being pretty steep for a food court meal.  Last but not least, the little side we got was packaged in a non-recyclable plastic container. It kind of sucked to throw it away after using it for five minutes.  Still, this is the best place in Market Mall's food court -- it tastes like real food, not food court junk food. Definitely tasty enough for a return visit.  Edit: The bacos we ordered on our second visit were soft and fluffy like we expected them to be, so I chalk up the tough, chewy bacos we got on our first visit to startup problems (our first visit was on the first day they were open)."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! The fact that I can go to Market Mall and make a healthy fast food choice makes me happy beyond belief! The salads are bursting with flavor! And love the raspberry & cardamom tea! I feel amazing after eating here and it keeps me full for hours! The ONLY reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is because it's a touch pricey."}
{"text":"Needed an early dinner that's nutritious and would not be hard on the wallet or my dairy free diet due to my lactose intolerance.   This place is owned by Jugo Juice and offers a great variety of high end salads by the scoop. $3./scoop. I had the curried cauliflower with chickpeas which was fantastic and the farro with olives, kale and walnuts. I topped it with ahi tuna. Total was $13. Tuna was perfect and the ingredients are of high quality. Very unexpected for food court! The container doesn't look like much but I was full afterwards. I will definitely return to try more salads"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I'm blown away that this kind of organic gourmet food is even in the food court!! So much to choose from, and things I've never had before! They are so friendly, great service, let you taste test everything they sell and are quite generous! I got two salads and a drink and omg talk about delicious explosions in your mouth. To top it all off its super healthy so after you gorge you feel awesome!!!"}
{"text":"So so yummy!!! Absolutely love this place! Delicious, healthy and allergy conscious. I can have a vegan, gluten free meal no problem! And all their other non-vegan, gluten-filled items are also amazing! :))"}
{"text":"Wow. I really couldn't wait to review this one.   I WAS SOOOOO HOPEFUL.   So, if you work downtown in YYC you know that (if you are health conscious and do not eat animals) there are very few things to choose from to truly nourish your body.   A coworker recommended this place after a walkby only....well..here's the scoop.   You line up buffet style to pick from any chosen number of scoops (pay per scoop) of salad and then add a protein at the end. Chicken or tuna the day I went.   Salads were ok looking....their online menu features the updated availability. They were all veggie options but one. I chose 4 scoops. I got Jeff 3 scoops and added chicken protein.   The salads came to a little over $20. Now, imagine, about 3/4 cup of cabbage, 3/4 cup of chickpeas, 3/4 cup Kale and 3/4 cup cauliflower add some erroneous spices...$10! These are CONVENTIONAL salads, not organic. I know their rent must be stiff but....  The worst part was the chicken...I don't eat it but it looked exactly like the pre-fab mechanically separated ones from Subway restaurants. Cold, white with a fake grill line on them. Jeff said he wretched when he saw it and couldn't eat it.   My coworker order the tuna as a protein and paid over $20 for his salad with 3 scoops of veggies!  For the quality I will not be back. I think this place is a novelty sadly.   To add: the person serving us didn't really speak English and couldn't explain how the system works, we had to repeat ourselves/questions 3 or 4 times to get the right food etc... The staff seem to lap over top of each other which makes it a bit of a goat rodeo in there...they should assembly line their process to streamline."}
{"text":"Amazing options for every diet! All food is fresh and tastes amazing. I never regret eating from here and I feel amazing after I do."}
{"text":"Whenever we go to Market Mall I always try to visit Dirtbelly as it is such a healthy alternative to food court food.  Our recent visit we ordered veggie baco, cardamom tealada, and beet salad. Baco is essentially bread and taco combined - the veggie Baco is so good. It's filled with a whole bunch of veggies (cauliflower, kale, lentils, etc.), and vegetarian meatballs/patties. It has a strong curry flavour and is drizzled with a sweet sauce (almost like donair sauce?). I have yet to try other bacos as I'm stuck craving this everytime.  Their salads are great as well, I love beets and kale so I usually get the beets with kale salad or anything with both mixed in them.  Don't forget to order a tealada to compliment your meal! They have 3 flavours you can choose from and all are extremely refreshing!  Okay now my review is making me hungry and crave for Dirtbelly!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to hear that dirtybelly decided to open a location in Market Mall as the one at the CORE downtown I felt can be pretty inaccessible if you don't happen to work there. My first experience when I went downtown was trying their popular bacos (bread+taco)! It essentially a donair/pita like looking wrap. It was good don't get me wrong, but I didn't think it was anything mind-blowing and it didn't leave much of an impression. When the Market Mall location opened up, I gave it a go again and tried a few of their salads. They have several fresh looking salads where they sell by the scoop and you can add a protein on top if you'd like (ahi tuna, chicken breast or veggie patty). I love that you can mix and match salads and it can be tough choosing one because there are so many options! I love the kale & acorn squash as well as the sweet potato & quinoa! Add a little ahi tuna and you have yourself a winning combo!   They have several types of their homemade iced tea, but I always gravitate towards the blueberry mint. It is incredibly refreshing and it is not overly sweet."}
{"text":"Expensive, but amazing.  You can influence how expensive it is in that you build your own bowl of ingredients, hard not to get everything as each selection looked fresh and tasty (kale/broccoli, beet salad, sweet potato/rutabaga sald, and more).  Protein options are great too, had ahi tuna which was a great value for the price."}
{"text":"Finally! a fresh & healthy spot to grab a quick, delicious, nice priced lunch!  First of all, the space is beautiful. it really sets the tone for what you're about to eat - sunny, bright, fresh, natural...  And now on to the food! you walk in, and get in line kind of cafeteria-style, and choose your scoops - $3.25 for each generous scoop, and you can choose up to 6 scoops. I only got 1 scoop of the curried cauliflower, golden raisin & almond salad and it was so good! My coworkers each got scoops of the other salads, so I think i ended up trying all of them, and we were all very impressed!  I also got a Baco (half bread/half taco) with Ahi Tuna, cabbage, and a nice spicy dressing - and I've truly thought about it about 5 times since I ate it 2 days ago. it was amazing!   I topped it all off with a refreshing Tealada!   We got back to the office and bragged about our amazing meals, and the rest of our office went yesterday and came back raving about Dirtbelly as well!   Definitely going to be my new go-to lunch spot. Very glad they're here!"}
