{"text":"Their products are delicious.
The price is high but if you really want to do something special for someone this a great way to do it.
I have ordered 4-5 baskets from them and each has been perfect.
I certainly don't mind spending the money when you get what you pay for! ;)"}
{"text":"Bought my sister an arrangement for her birthday, it came out to be about $100 with balloons. She was thrilled to get it and couldn't have been happier. She said the fruit was super fresh. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I came to arrange a delivery for my daughter's birthday.  They were great.  They answered my questions and helped me pick out an arrangement that my daughter would love.  They have things you can add on like balloons and teddy bears.  I opted for the balloons."}
{"text":"Placed an order from so many miles always and the man I spoke with over the phone was very helpful and professional in helping me choose what to get.   Had a short window time frame for delivery and were right on time:)"}
