{"text":"Mac and Cheese poppers look good but taste bland. Veggie pizza that's $16 is made on a thin pita bread- cheap as hell!! Come for the beer only :(  food left me craving something tasty..."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first visit here. The atmosphere on a Thursday night was good but not too loud for conversation. The service was attentive and cheerful. The food menu is varied and more interesting than the average pub grub; a bit pricey, but the salmon I had was delicious. And the beer flights were creative and quite good. The only disappointment was that the incredibly good Dark Horse Espresso APA wasn't available for purchase in growler format. I will definitely be back here on future visits to Toronto."}
{"text":"Great food. Great beer selection (the house beers could use some work...). Amazing servers. And THE best smelling bathroom I've ever been in. Will definitely come back. Awesome addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Really great service and I enjoyed the 'Hell's chicken sandwich' along with the house lager. Really nice addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great looking place, chill vibe and nicely decorated hip joint. Service was great, craft IPA was awesome but the food was meh. I wouldn't have the steak sandwich again, I can whip up better at home. And my spouse wouldn't have the fish and chips again. We won't be sitting back down at this restaurant but I will be stopping by for the occasional Growler!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money here. Was excited to come to this place for a friend's birthday, saw the photos online of the food and was excited about the brewery concept. We were disappointed with the terrible service but I think what bothered us the most was that the servers and the manager just didn't care.

We waited almost two hours (!!) for our food, and then when it came, there were several mistakes. For example, two of us had ordered salad with salmon/chicken and the salads showed up with no protein (more waiting). On top of this , drink orders were screwed up and the server didn't apologize but kept making up weird excuses. 

They accidentally dropped off a plate of mac and cheese poppers on the table and no one even ate them because they were so gross. I didn't know it was possible to make deep fried carbs with cheese taste bad. I got the beet root salad and I'm pretty sure the veggies were meant to be cooked but they were still really hard and the extra salmon was dry and tasted fishy. 

The place looked great on the website photos but it's a strange concept, like it's meant to be an upscale pub but it turned out awkwardly shiny/glossy and bro-y. There were also a strangely high number of little kids (literally) running around.

Overall, not a great experience and we definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I went with my bf and my bestie just because it was new and we were hungry. 

It turns out to be a great space for a place its size (it's very big) even thought we were taken upstairs the atmosphere was great and we got a table with a view of the hole place.
Food : we ordered 3 shareable :
Mussels, pork r and beef nachos 
Drink: tasting of beers 

Everything was excellent the sauce in the mussels combined with arugula (yum). The pork crispy with a tangy sauce. 
I usually don't eat nachos I think it's just overpriced chips but this ones were all with cheese and beef green onion I hardly had any empty chips, thumbs up ! 

Of course the beer was excellent !!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot imagine how a place with  a +10 location that also has the calling card of brewing onsite could offer such bad food to their patrons. Cold mussels and burned bread and then a salad with cold popcorn fried chicken bits (8 or 9) is not bringing us back again."}
{"text":"This place is busy! Large craft brewery pub. Larger than expected. 2 levels. Massive tv screens everywhere which lends to a great sports bar. Amazing to have this establishment in the neighbourhood. Menu is a bit limiting but tasty. I was not a fan of the wings...tasted baked. Not breaded or crispy. A little disappointed there. We also ordered the sole fish + chips and steak sandwich. Really good. The service was good surprisingly considering how busy they were. They have a little work to do (more menu options) but it's a great start. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were going to go elsewhere for date night (our girls with the sitter) but I really wanted to try the new restaurant on the block. Pretty disappointing all round. It was VERY busy & since we didn't have a reservation they placed us at the upper bar for all of 30 seconds (bartender was not friendly) then more confusion when the front of house were confused where to place us for a second time... 
My wife ordered the fish & chips - not great.
Sort of wet mushy sole on the inside and crispy on the outside. Nothing light and fresh about it. I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich which was delicious !
I think the owners have a real shot at making something happen here long term BUT the worst part of our experience wasn't necessarily the food but the service all round. Our waitress was not great. After our appetizers  she asked \"so would you like anything more or?\" Excuse me ? We've ordered $10 beers and 2 appies - we're out on Friday night - what do you think?
Bad Service. And to top it off she neglected us the whole night - aside from taking our initial order we had about 3 different people come to our table . Bad service. We have to tip 15 or 20% to a waitress we never see?
Everyone else did her work for her !
If this is the owners idea of expediting food & drink efficiently - this is the incorrect way to serve your customers - go back to genuine - 1 server service - to pay $100+ and be treated like that is horrible. Your hardworking paying customers deserve much better attention. Not a good first date out for us in over 9 months. ! Not sure if we'll go back ..."}
{"text":"Thanks for ruining my purse!

Went October 24th for appetizers and beer and the beer was fine and the wings were ok. Have had better. Really loud atmosphere. 

Really mad that they painted the washroom and the paint wasn't dry on the back of the door. No signs were up indicating wet paint. I hung my leather purse on the back of the door and now it is covered in paint. I will never go back and wouldn't recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"We went there on a week night for a book club Christmas celebration. The place is fairly new, excellent for large groups. 

The menu had a large selection. Everything looked delicious but I opted for the steak frites. My steak tasted ok as well as the skinny fries however nothing too memorable. Price was reasonable for a 10oz AAA strip loin steak $25. I ordered a chocolate raspberry chocolate cake for dessert, portion was large but I did not live it. I do not recommend this dessert, esp. for $9. 

Service was adequate and friendly. Servers were busy but around if you needed anything. 

Good overall experience."}
{"text":"It's obvious that this place is popular, We went on a Saturday night and it was packed which I guess is good, but because it was packed it was incredibly loud, very difficult to have a conversation.  The food wasn't terrible, but wasn't great, I ordered the steak frites but got a steak sandwich instead for some reason.  I also ordered a Caesar salad which I didn't get.  Overall not what I would call a great dining experience, but if you like large places with average food where it is very very loud then you should check it out."}
{"text":"We arrived early at 4:30pm and the place was still quiet (as it just opened at 4). We placed a beer order and it took 10 mins... acceptable if the place was full but it wasn't. The beer was decent but not exceptional. I understand the actual brewery portion of the establishment in not functional yet so I am sure we will see lots of improvement once this is finished and has been fine tuned. The apps we ordered were good although I thought it was weird we didn't get any salsa for our nachos. Throughout the evening the server forgot some of our beer orders or adds to our apps so our impression of the service was basic at best and could improve. I also feel that our server should have better knowledge of the beer since it is a brewhouse. She couldn't pronounce some of the names and had little knowledge of the beer. Serving staff at a brewhouse should be educated on the beer they serve.

Overall, I love the decor and will come back as we had a great time. I am sure this place will only get better over the next month as they refine everything. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Normally the service and quality of the food is good, but this one visit was enough to never go back. Service started out ok. After we ordered the food it took roughly 25-30mins to arrive. Server would avoid eye contact with me until I called him over to ask about the long wait. When the food finally arrived my meal portion was embarrassingly small and was also cold. For $14 I expect more then three tiny buns with cold shrimp and clams, cold fried onions and plain iceberg lettuce. When I complained about the meal he asked me if he could do anything. I wasn't going to get order another meal and have to wait another 25mins. No manager came by to apologize. Instead they sat at the bar socializing. How about you offer to remedy the situation instead of putting the onus on the customer. They should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"If you want the worst beer you can find in this city then here's the place. Not a single name brand beer so you're stuck with a bitter tasting beer that makes your mouth cringe. The food is average and over priced, and the staff have attitude and seem to be very busy keeping up with just a few tables occupied. There are better places to go a few steps away."}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks after it opened. The food is pretty great-- we had the lemon and pepper chicken wings to start and the fish and chips, and a hamburger. The fish was excellent, burger was average. The real standout was the Rosemary fries which were awesome. 

We also tried the cocktails- a Pink Panther house mix was okay. The Pommies Dry Cider was awesome.

Overall the service was pretty slow. We waited half an hour for a table when we were told it was only a 15 min wait. Then we waited almost 50 min for our entrees. I think they're still working out the kinks in the kitchen, and it was a packed Friday night with a line up to get in.

Overall I would come back, but on a less busy night so we wouldn't have to wait so much."}
{"text":"I like to give places a few chances, particularly when they're new to the game. After a number of visits, Louis Cifer still doesn't deserve my dollars.

Three main complaints: 1) Their house beers are below par for the course in Toronto (putting it nicely...). This is not a deal breaker, as they usually have a couple good local options (out of the 10 craft options or so) available, so the beer is still worth drinking (Karma Citra from Great Lakes, today). 2) Their food is poor value, and overall not that good. I'm always shocked by what i receive for the price... Brunch today consisted of farmer sausage that was closer to a hot dog than any farmer sausage I've ever had and a secret 'hangover' sauce that was tomato sauce... 3) Service has always been very poor, from a publicly overbearing front of house manager to perpetually training new staff (connected?), to long waits for refills, to... Every time is something new.

Combined with a overbearing, heavy handed corporate branding vibe, a restaurant that's always 60% empty, and better options in the vicinity to watch a game, catch a beer, or eat food... I'm done."}
{"text":"It's probably more 3.5 stars, but I feel bad for some of the negative reviews given during their first week open, so I've opted to round up instead of down.  It's a big space, so I think it's reasonable that it takes a few weeks to iron out the wrinkles. 

Went on a Monday night.  Ordered a flight of four 5oz glasses (can choose anything on tap: from their 3 house brews, and about a dozen others).  The waitress was very knowledgeable about beers, and discussed IBU measurements and stuff like that, but then she simplified it when she realized I was a dummy....but wasn't condescending at all :)   I believe everything they have on tap is from Canadia, but I'm not 100% sure as there were a couple I didn't know.  The house brews were a lager, an IPA, and a Dirty Blonde.  I tried all three, and they were all quite nice (I'm not a fan of IPAs generally, but the other two were very drinkable).  

Food was good.  We shared a beer&cheddar fondue, chicken wings, and blackened cod tacos.  Everything was really good.  Fish tacos were a bit too saucy, but had a nice flavour.  Fondue was served with pumpernickel bread, and nacho chips.  Wings are a dry style, which isn't my first choice way to have them, but it's a personal preference.  

The space is really big, especially for a spot on the Danforth.  Due to Ontario's Draconian alcohol laws, the beer is currently brewed off-site, and they have yet to start selling growlers (large takeaway jugs) which will only up the cool factor once those elements are added.  
 
And, last but certainly not least, everyone working there was very friendly and nice.  It was a really good spot to have a bite to eat and some unique brews, and I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Our experience began well. We were seated quickly, and given an overview of the brew works before our waiter introduced himself. We wanted to sample some of the beer brewed on site, and ordered two flights. The names of the beer were related to the name of the brew works, like American Gothic Brown Ale.

The flights arrived quickly, and the sampling began. 

I found the beer rather bland. They looked nice in the glass, but were lacking in flavour. I like dark beers, and the ones I sampled: Extra Special Bitter, American Gothic Brown Ale, Dry Irish Stout. While there were subtle differences between these beers, the common element was the lack of distinctive flavour.

The beer said, what really bothered me was the way the server changed his attitude toward us when we said we would not be ordering a pint of anything. His friendly demeanour changed to cold indifference. He vegan to clear away the glasses though we had not finished everything, and while not rude, was definitely not as friendly as when we first sat down.

We will not be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"We dropped in for drinks and some snacks after a Sunday afternoon stroll on the Danforth. First impressions were good. Nice clean open space and soft lighting. I actually prefer my pubs a little more down and dirty. But it is hard to fault any eating establishment for its cleanliness. 
   We ordered some fries and nachos. They arrived in no time flat. I would say the food is a notch above standard pub fare. My Louis Cifer Dirty Blonde was a decent brew pub pint. Amy's Sauvignon blanc came in 6 or 9 oz pours. Everything was reasonably priced.
    It is clear Louis Cifer is aiming for a wide demographic. When we were there a  bunch of dudes were watching football at the bar. Couples and families were sprinkled at the tables. Yes, there were a few Children about (Including one of ours). This is the Danforth. If you are not kid-friendly, you are probably not going to stay in business. It is the kind of place you could spend Saturday night pounding drinks with your friends and then show up Sunday for lunch with your mom."}
{"text":"This place continues to bring me back. Love that we have a local brewery with a great selection to choose from. I personally like the pale ale, but any of them seem to do in a pinch.

It was also a great place to watch Canada win Gold in the World Juniors. Great atmosphere...great good...great service...and like I said before...great drinks."}
{"text":"Wings were ok.  Beer not so ok.  They just started brewing (early Feb) so I will have to do it again.  But a beer place should serve excellent wings, especially for $14."}
{"text":"I feel bad doing this, but hopefully this will just contribute to what should be appropriately mixed reviews. Lots of people seemed to be enjoying themselves; that's their prerogative. If you have ever walked into a gigantic, squeaky clean, big box type restaurant and thought: \"my kinda place\" then honestly, you might love it.

It takes all kinds."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try the new place on the block. We had a friendly greet from the hostess and because it was busy we took some seats at the upstairs bar. The bartender was really friendly and we decided to order drinks and appies while we waited for a table.
I had the a Caesar which was fantastic! It came with candied bacon as garnish and a small 5oz glass of beer. Worth a try! My boyfriend tried their cider slushy drink, also a win!
We shared an order of pork belly rinds and sticky ribs. Both came quickly and were delicious. 
Our table was ready for us before we finished our appies so we transferred over to our table before ordering our entrees. We were also not disappointed with those either. We had the steak frites and Cornish hen. My boyfriends mentioned the Cornished Hen had great flavor and was very moist. My Steak Frites were wonderful and was cooked just how I like it. 
 Honestly I would recommend this place to family and friends!"}
{"text":"Soo went here to eat and drink. Been here many times. Seems to be consistently not too good when it comes to food.
I am a chef but generally not picky.
And i almost never write yelp reviews unless its good. But I feel i need to write one for this.

Great looking restaurant with a good feel and vibe. Id give it a 8.5/10

Beer is good and seemingly unique 8.5/10

Food is not soo good in my opinion. 2/10

And ill explain why.

Been here maybe 5 times. Usually for the beer.

But 2 out of the 5 times i ordered food.

1 was for brunch. Sometime in the winter of this year. I had the eggs benny. The eggs were somehow way over cooked (pretty hard to over cook a poached egg) and the salad was definitly past its prime. I sent it back (and i super rarely send anything back ever) and they gave me a new one with pretty much the same problem. But i was far too hungover and hungry to care at that point. Soo i ate it. Tipped well (it wasnt the servers fault soo why not) and moved on with my day.

Soo tonight we went for beer and food. Beer was good as per usual.
Service was good. Not too much harrassment lol.

Then the food came and it was almost funny.
My friend is also a chef and he was with me. And we both felt the same way.

We had the: 
Pretzel Platter thing: sounded good on paper. But when it came it was funny.
The cute little baby dried out flavorless pretzel along with the dried out sausages was too funny. The pretzel had its chance to shine. But didnt. And the potato salad which almost tasted like Ziggys brand or something from a grocery store. Just overall a big miss. $17.00 kinda arrogant. Oh and the paper on the bottom of the food on top of a wooden plank. Eating paper is fun. Potato salad + paper not the most grand idea.

Sweet fries - whatever its just sweet fries pretty typical. But the cute little bowl they came in was also funny. $8.00. Also kinda arrogant

Fish and chips - 1 small piece of heavly battered fish. Along side of your typical fries. Coleslaw. And tatar sauce. Nothing had any wow factor. All very typical and bland. $17.00 also pretty arrogant.

I go to a hole in the wall restaurant by where I live all the time... why? Because they have really good food. Good prices. Good portions. Good service. Super friendly.

Louis Cifer has amazing potential. Just really missing the mark with the food.

Also walked by and saw someones nachos. And that was just the most silly joke.

Hopefully they will learn from this review. As I do wish to go there again. And on the regular. But at this point. Just for beer.

Key Note: 

If your going to charge above average price for food. Have above average food. Noone will mind paying the price for good food. I sure dont mind."}
{"text":"Recently went in for drinks with a small group on a quiet night. We were greeted by a friendly hostess. This was definitely the best part of the night. The restaurant had about a dozen patrons and a dozen employees to match but you could do nothing short of setting a large fire to get their attention. After waiting 25 minutes, our beers finally arrived (one at a time, for some reason). I have never waited so long for a pint of beer in my life. I contemplated drinking my own urine, but I heard it doesn't get you buzzed. This is when one of the staff members came over with her own beer and gave a cheers to the table. She seemed to get her beer a lot faster than we did. If I felt like waiting 25 minutes for a beer, I wouldn't. Since we didn't feel like waiting for a second round, we paid our bill and packed up. On our way out, the once friendly hostess was now talking on her cellphone, arguing with her boyfriend. Lose the zero, girl! You're a babe but your restaurant sucks."}
{"text":"Book your get together now!!!!!

Over the years we have tried to find a place to bring together good friends. Today Louis Cifer did an amazing job.  Great food great price and excellent service.  We had a blast and I know many if us will be returning.  Book your next party here!!!"}
{"text":"Completely underwhelmed by the food and the service.  

Very short and uninspired menu of food.  Perhaps made worse when we asked our server for any insight and her response was a robotic \"oh that's good\" and \"oh that's good too\" for pretty much every item.   Not terribly believable that EVERYTHING is good at any restaurant.  Should have been our first clue I guess. 

Food is plain.  Quite boring and poorly presented.  My GF had the chicken pot pie.  I'm sure it came out of a yellow cardboard no frills box before being nuked in the kitchen.  I had the steak (leather) and frites.  Medium rare was well done.  And the frites were limp and cold.  

We watched as this location was renovated with great anticipation and were sadly let down when we finally took the plunge.  

One redeeming feature; its a huge place, nicely decorated and the selection of beers was eclectic and intriguing and the one we tried had milk and ginger listed in its ingredients and was tasty.   Not tasty enough to bring us back.   

Sad to say, but this large format restaurant on a jam packed eatery street will probably have a limited shelf life."}
{"text":"If you call well in advance to book a party of 18 for a birthday it would be completely understandable for one to expect everyone to sit at the same table, especially for a such a large venue. That was not the case and management was very unorganized with resolving the issue and very unapologetic. 

I love beer so I and my partner ordered a flight each. Overall their ambers porters and stouts were very tasty. Lagers and IPAs not so great. 

I had one of the specials as my main. Thai spicy beef. Very tasty with the right amount of heat. Could have used 
More vegetables. 

I really wish they would have used more of the budget to make their washrooms look nice/cleaner."}
{"text":"The new kid of the block is pretty cool!

We stumbled into this place on Sunday at noon, just one week after they opened. We went in not knowing what to expect and came out very pleasantly surprised. 

This small brewpub brews their own beer in house (you can see the brewing equipment right beside the dining room). 

The pub itself is set up with tons of television for watching the game, the layout is designed to easily cater to groups, the service was quick and everyone was really friendly.

I ordered the chicken sandwich with beet salad on the side to replace the fries and loved my meal. The sandwich was tender, juicy and had an unexpected kick to it. The beet salad was both aesthetically appealing and delicious (the hummus especially).

Others ordered burgers which came in cute little boxes.

I imagine this place still has a little fine tuning to do (like adding a brunch menu, maybe expanding the regular menu a little too), but as it is, Louis Cifer is a great addition to The Danforth strip and one I imagine will be around for quite some time, but don't take my word for it, see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends on a warm Friday night in early July.  The place was less than half full at about 7:30/8pm when we arrived.  Large dark restaurant/brew bar that would hold at least 100 if I had to guess, with tables spread over different levels and a large bar on the right hand side.  

Friendly service.

I had the Hand cut nachos ($14 Corn tortilla, red onion, jalapeño, shredded cheese, scallion, sour cream, pico. extra $3 for guac) which were good, but quite standard overall.  The Mac & Cheese Poppers ($10 Cheddar & jack cheese, panko breaded, pickles, smoked habanero ketchup) were good and exactly what you would expect of a baked breaded ball of mac & cheese.  My partner had the Hell's Kitchen Sandwich ($15 chicken breast, shredded cheese, hot 'n' sweet pepper relish, ranch, rosemary shoestring frites) and he liked it a lot.  Another in my party tried the Brew Works burger ($14 Lettuce, tomato, red onion, toasted potato bun, rosemary shoestring frites.) which he said was very flavorful, but he had to eat it with a knife & fork because the bun wasn't strong enough to support the weight and juiciness of the toppings.  He even mentioned this to the server as a recommendation that they replace the bun with a ciabatta or something similar, then all would be perfect.  The last person had the Chicken Pot Pie ($16 Short crust, mashed potato, market vegetables) and liked it.  He also tried the Craft Root Beer and wasn't sure what to make of it, but I tasted a sip and found it very good and interesting.  We all could smell a strong licorice smell from it, without realizing that was what we could smell.

I'd definitely go back here and try the portobello burger most likely."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here with a few friends that live in the neighbourhood tonight.  Excited for this place to open up, it was an establishment we had been anticipating in our new found home for a while.  My girlfriend and I split the mac and cheese poppers and the beet salad.  The beets were undercooked and hard as...uncooked beets.  Halfway through the poppers, my girlfriend pulled out (from inside the popper) a  2-inch square piece of paper that had been deep-fried into our food.  Several of us having worked in the service industry, and knowing that this was a new establishment, let the server and manager know, something to let the cooks know to be mindful of.  Our server took the dish back to the kitchen, and didn't return with a comment.  We understand that everyone at the establishment was busy tonight, but what they weren't too busy for was to include this inedible dish that was taken back to the kitchen on our bill.  The manager, Erin, had just told us we were fresh out of luck.  

The place was very under prepared.  A lot of their house brews were sold out and the washrooms were out of order.  The only person that had a worse dinner than us was the girl next to us that had a tray of four beers spilt on top of her head.   The mess wasn't even cleaned up,  she had to sit next to her date soaking wet, while they just put a \"caution, slippery when wet\" sign next to her drenched jacket.  

It's too bad they didn't put that caution sign outside."}
{"text":"Because Danforth is starving for new restaurants in the 'hood we have embraced LC's arrival and would encourage a visit. We have been here twice, both in the evening at dinner time. I love the Pommies Dry Cider slush and pretty much any of their appetizers - sticky spare ribs, mac 'n' cheese poppers, rosemary shoestring fries - which I found better than their main dishes - blackened sole tacos were meh. 

The staff are friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. 

It is definitely a loud environment - both times we sat on the main floor near the windows so maybe we need to try a different location at the back, but it was so noisy we couldn't hear one another having to lean in while shouting and straining to hear one another. This is a place that's built for large groups."}
{"text":"Great place to come watch the game! good atmosphere and a nice large TV. Food isn't incredibly overpriced and I'd recommend the shareable nachos with pulled pork. They come to $17 but its a huge portion. Their Caesar tastes great too! The beer, not so much."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I'm always conflicted - some things are so good, which makes the few things that are so terrible just confusing. The most recent time my friend and I designed our own flights and really enjoyed all the beers, especially the Rosehip Hefe. The mac and cheese poppers were incredible - the perfect amount of sweetness in the habanero ketchup and super crunchy and flavourful. But the nachos were flat out dreadful: retried bean paste was smeared on the bottom of the pan, making all the chips soggy. There was basically no cheese, and entire cherry tomatoes (which are impossible to scoop with chips, and being roasted just added to the sogginess). The whole affair was a damp, tasteless mess.

I've been before and really enjoyed the daily special of the pulled pork taco, which sadly was only on the menu that one time. That time we ordered some hoptails, which were nowhere near worth their high price point, and were grossly garnished (cold bacon stuck into a weak cocktail? Gross to look at and to eat). But the cider slushie is a great way to feel 8 and 26 at the same time. So I'm so torn, because some things are genuinely good,and some things are total flops."}
{"text":"Good service, good beer.   Not sure why this place only has three stars; was quite reasonable we felt.   Liked the sausage special in particular."}
{"text":"It's nice to see brew pubs opening across the city. The Danforth seems like an area that should already have one of these, but my buddies who live in the area assure me that this is a big deal for the hood. Given the nature of the operation, I'll rate this place mostly on the beer and atmosphere.

The house beer selection isn't as extensive as say Mill Street or Amsterdam, but I enjoyed all that I had, including the blonde, the IPA and the lager. There's also a pretty extensive list of local craft brews on tap, so they are very well covered for beer.

In terms of atmosphere, I was impressed by just how large this restaurant is for the area. The decor and general feel of the place is a step up for the area. Very modern looking, yet the seating is comfortable, which is essential if you're going to spend a few hours drinking with your buddies,

The food was pretty standard pub fare, but on the expensive side. $10 for five tiny mac and cheese poppers? The burger offered better value for money, but it was nothing outstanding either.

This restaurant gets four stars due to the excellent service. Our server was attentive and had some great beer recommendations."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the 3 or 4 times I've been here previously, however the first time I bring my best friend and my parents for dinner my veggie burger and my best friends meat burger were both dried out to beyond reasonable. 
The were definitely under the heat lamp for 20 min. 
It was gross and not really that shocking because the food took forever and though there wasn't a lot of people in the place I felt that they were very short staffed. 
I do not believe it was the servers fault but it was sooo slow we were starving. 
The owner did comp us 15% off the 2 inedible dishes but I'm super disappointed in how far this place has fallen. 

There used to be separate hosts and servers and bartenders who were certified to explain the brewery. It seemed like a different place then."}
{"text":"It's no secret; I love beer! When walking down the Danforth, it's only natural that I would end up at Louis Cifer. It's a delightful brewery and restaurant. They have a great beer selection, both their own and local. This is a large venue, with upstairs and patio seating. This place is great for large groups! I've been there a few times and each visit was devilishly fab. 

My first visit consisted of beer and burgers. I grabbed a flight and a Brew Works Burger with fries. Fresh, hot and tasty; it went well with the beer. I tried a flight of 4 house brews. If you've never had their beers, I recommend a flight. They've got some unique flavours on their Saison/One-Off menu you've got to taste, like Blood Orange Blonde and Coconut Lemongrass Thai-PA. 

My second visit was for brunch! It was in the afternoon; not thinking that I was there for brunch, only that I was at a brewery, I definitely had beer with my Eggs Benny. #facepalm Their eggs benny is called Big Benny for a reason; the meat is thicker than the bread. I couldn't freaking believe it. I've eaten a ridiculous amount of eggs benny and I've never seen it like this. While I was going into shock, my aunt enjoyed her Huevos Rancheros and beer. Another stellar visit to Louis Cifer! 

The last visit was during a pub crawl. We had the whole upstairs and we needed it. I'm not sure they quite expected the 100+ people that arrived in 30min time. They didn't have any specials for the pub crawl, but the servers worked their asses off serving us. They did an amazing job; very organized with some serious teamwork. 

Each visit was different, but the great beer and great service were consistent. I look forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"This place gets a solid 2.5. I've been here a few times and the experience can be very unpredictable. The first time I dined here was brunch. They served me undercooked potatoes. This is the worst thing you can do to someone who truly enjoys their breakfast spuds. It was months ago and I still remember it. I recall our server at the time was quick to whisk it away and apologize. I appreciated that. 

The most recent experience was for Monday night trivia, which is actually a good time. I ordered the Lemon Salt n Pepper wings ($14) and couple others ordered the chicken pot pie (comes recommended by the server $16) - both I would recommend. The pot pie was supposed to come with mashed potato except they were out. It's 8pm and you're out of mashed potatoes? What is it with this place and potatoes?! 

The kicker came at the end when my friends ordered a second pitcher of the house lager. My friend took a sip and thought it tasted off so we all took a sip of it to confirm before he told the server. Believe me it was definitely off. We conveyed this to our server and she took it away. She came back to us a bit later and said \"we'll take this off your bill, but the manager and another bartender tasted it and they say it tastes fine\". Why oh why did you have to tell us that?? 
First of all, we never asked for their opinions. There's four people, no wait, four paying customers who say this particular pitcher of lager tastes strange. Secondly, it's not like we drank most of it and then told you there was something wrong with it. Lastly, congrats to you that two employees think it tastes like how it's supposed to and we're wrong. 
I think their house beer is pretty good so the one bad pitcher of beer is absolutely not a reflection of the quality. However, the servers ability to handle this situation was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Those of us who live around the Danforth have been eyeing this place get set up for months. We've seen restaurants come and go here, because the space is huge, and when Myth left, nothing has had the ability to fill the house since. Until Louis Cifer :) This is their first official weekend, and thank God we made reservations. The place was packed with happy people, and the flow of people through the door between 8:00 and 9:30 when we left was constant. We think this place has staying power. First, it's a brew pub, so you can buy the beer, and drink the product. From beer flights to brew-infused cocktails, the beer scene here is amazing. The bar menu has lots to offer beyond beer, but the beer cocktails have me returning. The menu is large enough to provide variety, but no so huge it will compromise the kitchen. Star starters for us included pork belly rinds (OMG) and the ribs (OMG OMG). Dinner was Hell's Chicken sandwiches, which were amazing. Totally loved the fries. So many restaurants fall down on the fries. Louis has the shoestring, perfect fries happening. This place is a slick machine, without feeling fake. FABULOUS staff have been trained really well for such a new place. Every detail from the logo to the decor is really professional. The room (two floors of it) was abuzz with happy people, everywhere, from families to older couples, to first daters, to singles. Erin, the owner, should be thrilled to death, sore feet and all :) If right after opening, packed to the rafters, her staff can serve without huge delays, and the kitchen can pump out amazing food at that pace, she's likely to last here in our hood for a while :))))) Just keep taking reservations, Erin! We don't do lineups ;)"}
{"text":"We arrived, placed our order, received our drinks and salad almost immediately. So excited for such quick service. An HOUR later, our fish tacos arrived. They were seriously bad. So bad that we called the manager over to say Wth?! You don't expect us to eat these do you? The fish was burnt, the taco was rock hard (like it had been heated then sat under a lamp for 30 mins) and there was some kind of mayo PILED on top. Was horrible. He apologized profusely, took our 2nd order and brought us frites to tide us over (we were starving at this point). Our 2nd order was a chicken sandwich and a burger. LOVED the chicken sandwich, my friend said the burger was great. (frites were spot on btw) Its too bad about the fish tacos.. They did not charge us for any of the food, just our drinks, which I thought was crazy nice of them. Will defiinitely go back. Despite how busy they were, the service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Another great brewery visit! Really enjoy these places, as they are always unique and have awesome beer options! This one is no exception. 

Came by after dinner, and grab a couple beers! They had some amazing ones made in house and other that were locally brewed. Definitely worth asking the server for a little taste of whatever you're interested in. 
They also have beer cocktails of whatever they are offering then, so it's definitely worth a look too!

They had some nice options on the menu as well, and the cheesecake was quite a nice dessert touch. 

Definitely worth coming for some nice, unique beers from our own local area!"}
{"text":"Went here with a large group for my friend's birthday. Some ordered drinks and some ordered food. I ordered an old fashioned, which was good. I didn't have any food, but they didn't give too many fries, as evidenced by my buddies seemingly empty plate. He said it tasted good, but would have like a somewhat bigger portion.
The server was kind and quick and brought me my bill as soon as I was ready to leave the party for another event. 
I'd go back."}
{"text":"We just went in for some after dinner drinks and sat at the bar. The establishment is very nice and clean. We went on a Sunday night and it was very busy because it is one of the only places along the Danforth open later. The beer and drink list is extensive, and I am excited to try their own brew when it is finished. The bartender was friendly and extremely knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this place to other people going for a night out in the area."}
{"text":"Came in on a whim during a Sunday stroll with the Mr. along Danforth. 

Started with a hoppy flight if their home brew and was happy with every single one! My face was the Thai PA. Coconut, lemongrass beer-yum! Mr. Had a blonde brew and was also very happy. 

Started with Mac and cheese poppers-perfection. The habanero ketchup had an awesome kick to it-will order again.

Mains-Mr. Ordered fish and chips and said the fish was a little mushy, chips were home it awesomeness 
Me-burger and fries. Loved both 

We were stuffed but decided to go the distance and ordered a slab of cheesecake to share. It was sooo good. The graham crust was to die for-crispy goodness. 

Our server was super friendly and just the right amount of attentive. 

They played movies upstairs at 7pm which was a pretty cool idea even though we opted not to watch it. 

We will definately be back!!"}
{"text":"The star had a good write up on the place  and its new so my wife and I decided to check it out. The place has a great ambience, decor done very nicely. Good concept. I had a couple pints, she had an iced tea. Unfortunately it did not meet our expectations on food and service. Don't order the onion soup. Its $9, portion is small and it was average at best.  She had the fish and chips but it was more like bad batter and chips. I had the works burger with bacon.  It was mostly charred and way over cooked. I was hungry going into the place but still left a 3rd of it because it tasted so bad. The waitress  noticed we didn't finish our food but she didnt care to ask if everything was okay. I went a few doors down and got a gyro to fill me up afterwards cos I didnt want to spend anymore.  For what we spent we could've went to most places on danforth.

We probably wont be heading back there."}
{"text":"The beer was good, but the service is really slow! We waited 15 min before our server came to the table and when he did, he didn't have any knowledge of the beer that was brewed in house."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see that Louis Cifer Brew Works was going into this space, and had been following their website and social media to see when they were going to open.

Went in tonight with my father and had dinner. Overall I would say it was a very solid showing - especially for the place only being open about 5 days now. I will definitely be back with friends and family and am looking forward to catching a football game or two at the bar.

Food: 
I had the Hand Cut Nachos with Guacamole ($14 + $3 guacamole). Found it very good, large portion. Finished with lime but I thought it was a little heavy and I probably wouldn't opt to add the guacamole in the future but would certainly order again.

My father had the Blackened Sole Tacos ($14) which came with three tacos, rosemary fries and salad. Also a little large on the portion size but great value. The tacos were lukewarm by the time they got to us but I am sure there are some remaining kinks in the kitchen to workout regarding timing. Would also order this again.

Drinks:
I had the Dead Elephant which was awesome. Dad had the Central City Red Racer and while it was not really what he was looking for he still liked it.

PS. To ownership: one of my favourite parts of our meal was the good music (Van Morrison, Aretha Franklin, Isley Brothers, etc.) Don't change that, enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"Amaizing place to celebrate or have a date! I loved the burger and the IPA beer!"}
{"text":"I really like beer and Louis Cifer offers a great variety!  Sometimes you want to try a new beer but have to commit to a whole pint without knowing whether you will like it or not.  At this pub, you get to have a sample before you buy it which is a great idea!

I was impressed with their beer variety but not with the Greek fries I ordered.  There wasn't much feta cheese or other toppings on them as I expected.  Others who ordered food also weren't wowed by their meals.  The pub is really big so it's good for groups but I can only recommend the place for drinks."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day and had a great time.  By night I probably wouldn't hang here because it has bit of a sports bar vibe but the food and service was great.  Nice people and comfortable seating for a lunch break.  The beer was ok, but hey they do their thing and I respect that.  Beer and food places like this are always welcome in my opinion as long as people that work there are cool with no attitude.  Nice find."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times already.  Tried the slushy cider (amazing!) and ate the spicy chicken burger - definitely had a kick.  I might have gotten the hot relish on the side...

This last time I took 3 of my coworkers for dinner on a Wednesday night as I know Thurs-Sunday this place is PACKED and it's harder to get a table due to being so obviously popular.  Those times are sports-bar-ish good fun with a hundred friends.

I did the craft beer taster platter (4 selections) and found the LG Lager the best (for me) - this, I'm told is their own brew, currently brewed off-site, but, soon to be on site (looking forward to taking a growler home).  I had a small taste of their own brewed rootbeer as well, which was delic.

The only fault, for me, is the noise level.  But, you know, I can't find ANYWHERE in Toronto where we are not yelling over our dinner, so it seems to be the 'going thing' these days.  So paradoxical, especially considering people are often staring into their phones in pubs... I didn't see people doing that at this place.  Maybe not a 'fault' after all... definitely worth a drop in if you are heading to the Danforth.  One of my new faves!"}
{"text":"It's between two stations and right on the main road so it's accessible via public transportation and it's also easy to get a ride from right outside the bar. It's huge inside and it's a lot of noise - but the vibe overall is positive and the wait staff are always on top of it. Their selection of beers is amazing and they have food that'll appeal to anyone. A very generic bar but I would still recommend it to people."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Louis Cifer while exploring the Danforth on a Saturday afternoon. The place looks bright and open and the size is impressive. They have a great beer selection and the wait staff are knowledgable. Where this place falls short is the food. It's decent enough but for the price you expect so much more. I had the Angel's Burger ($17) and for that price I'd expect a top-shelf meal. Instead I got a mediocre burger that you'd find at any chain pub in the city. Still, the place has lots of potential and I look forward to returning again."}
{"text":"The fiancé and I went to this bar before our concert at the Danforth Music Hall. We stumbled upon this place by chance, since the other bar we originally planned to go didn't have a great menu that night. 

We were pleasantly surprised by how big the restaurant was and were intrigued by all the house made brews they had on tap. Our server was nice enough to let us try a few drinks before we found one we liked. I'm picky about my drinks and she was patient with me. They have a no return policy on drinks, which is why you get to sample them beforehand. The drinks we had were alright. I had a dry apple cider topped with cider slush and the fiancé had a few of the beers that were made in house. The fiancé said his beers were good, but not amazing. 

We had the mussels in a white wine sauce with bacon and arugula as a starter. The sauce was delicious, but I kept biting into pieces of shell when I scooped up bacon bits with my fork. I had the pretzel and sausage platter that was served with a warm pretzel, chorizo sausage, and some other sausage I couldn't figure out. The pretzel was soft and yummy and the sausages were delicious, too. My dish was served with a red potato salad, which I also enjoyed. The fiancé had the fish tacos, which came with 3, rosemary shoestring fries, and a garden salad. The tacos were alright. The sides were better. The fiancé said the tacos were missing something... like a sauce. 

We were satisfied with our meals and service and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I liked this place! Great atmosphere, yummy food. I had the Hell's Kitchen chicken sandwich, which was really yummy. A bit pricey, but good overall. I will go back."}
{"text":"Although every thing looks clean and nice but something in atmosphere is off. Food is below average and overprice for the quality. Beer is not memorable but you will see this place crowded anyway, because of the lengthy patio an huge windows which gives a nice view over the street to it. Good spot for watching people and that is about it."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! 
Although we understand this is a brewery, we were out to dinner that night, and we spontaneously decided to visit this place.

My low rating does not reflect the beer quality or price nor quality of the food, even though the selection was poor and minimal.....but the service from multiple employees.

From the moment we entered the bar, no one was there to greet or seat us, we stuck around for a good 7-10minutes, in the meantime had a chance to grab a random menu we found lying around and review some of the food options. Eventually when we were approached by one of the staff members we asked what the gluten-free options were and if there were any. We were reassured that there are many items and the restaurant was able to accommodate, the woman at the front pointed out the items that could be gluten-free and I felt we had enough options although poor, as in fries, wings and burger.....still,  we decided to stay seeing as we were hungry and really needed to eat something - pretty much anything at that point. After being seated it took our waitress a good 10 maybe 15 minutes to arrive and greet us. At that point we ordered our drinks and peptides to start, long story short- my drink was brought to me after a few sips, I realized it was the wrong drink, the waitress took our order over a tablet, and perhaps put it in wrong, maybe she misheard due to the loud atmosphere, she was insistent that it's what I had ordered  I had suggested that the drink be corrected and she said she would be right back with the ingredients. .??     Our  waitress was gone for a very long time and when she arrived she was asking us if everything was OK if we like to make our orders, clearly forgetting about my tiny martini which was wrong....at that time I said I have change my mind about my drink since a good 20 minutes has passed the ice in it had melted... (yes there was ice in it?) and she was supposed to correct it and I would like to now send the wrong cocktail back and have another drink that I would like more than the drink she had chosen for me which was not what I wanted to begin with. A little while later she returns with that same drink and says we cannot ACCEPT it and take it back we have tried to fix it and here you go ,?!!! To our surprise....I said the drink was the wrong one to begin with I wanted it corrected 20 minutes ago but my final decision now was to send it back and to have something else. Also we had ordered appetizers which took a good 45 minutes to arrive mind you it was 1 pound of wings which was about 6 pieces and we ordered the appetizer muscles. The wait was ridiculous the service was below standard the food quality was OK nothing to write home about but most importantly we were very upset about the service and the wrong orders also the fact that the waitress rrefused to correct my order and take the wrong order back, no manager came to speak to us no manager came to reassure us about anything. At that point we decided to send a drink back and now not order anything else not even our dinners we finished your appetizers paid and left we ended up going next to door to go for IL FORNELLO and had a great dinner I would not come back to this place nor my husband, we would not recommend it! the menu selection was poor as is- and from the items that were supposed to be gluten-free 90% of them were actually not and I was only made aware of that issue long after I placed my order for example anything deep-fried apparently is not gluten-free because they only use one fryer most restaurants have multiple fryers.  And the women in the front was clearly clueless, and misled us! And the only thing off the grill was a steak. that was an embarrassing selection of a one page menu never again!"}
{"text":"No question about it.  This is indeed THE hot new spot on the Danforth.  And seeing it in action last Saturday as the sixth and final stop on the Danforth Social Meetup's 2nd pub crawl, it made me realize how the Danforth was terribly missing and perfectly set for something just like it.

The interior is quite trendy--feels way more like a restaurant than a bar or pub.  This would be a great place to take a date or to go with a small group.  Service throughout our stay was excellent.

We showed up late and the staff were very accommodating despite the fact that we did not have a table reserved.  Some of us ordered food and it looked good.  I tried their blonde and it was a best beer I had of the night although that may not be writing much given the nature of pub crawls on the Danforth.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Upon entry, the decor seemed dark, inviting and comfortable. The atmosphere was lively without being rowdy. This restaurant is also huge; the main level has ample seating (bar, tables and a patio bench), and the second floor seemed to be quite large as well. 

Being a brewery, Louis Cifer offers a small selection of house beers. Interestingly, they also offer a cider slush (pommerie?). Since I couldn't decide on what to order, I ended up getting a flight of four beers ($10 for 4, 5 oz beers). Since I can't remember the exact names of the other three beers I tried, I will tell you my thoughts on the cider slush; the actual flavour wasn't too Apple-y, but the slush on top made the drink extra refreshing. 

I thought that the food wasn't as good as their beverages; I had the sweet potato fries with chipotle aioli ($7), and the mussels with arugula, tomatoes and bacon ($14). While the fries were pretty good, portion size was too small to justify the price. The mussels were plump and juicy, but again, portion size was too small. 

This place would be 3 stars if only the food was considered, but the extra star is for the great service; the owner, was quick to recommend some beers for us when we didn't know what to order, while our server was friendly, talkative (not overly so) and took away used dishes promptly."}
{"text":"Not taking away from anyone's review, but I have to question the ratings. There's nothing exciting about this place besides the location and the size and decor of the establishment. 

I'm gonna have to agree with Thomas, Randy and Kate! Definitely not a place you want to eat at! Food wasn't the greatest and to be honest I found the wings over priced and boring! I paid $16 for oversized wings that literally came with 4 old dried up pieces of veggies. Cucumbers and carrots that still had the dirty skin on them smh.

I expressed my disappointment to the bartender who served me and she giggled. I guess I was comical lol! Anyways the beer I had sucked too! It was \"The Original Sin\" blonde! So just my opinion, whoever rated the place anything above 3 stars have friends who either own this place or work here 

My 3 stars are for location and decor lol"}
{"text":"I happened upon this place on a very quiet Sunday afternoon.  Great bartender, great beer selection. I didn't try the food but would most certainly give it a shot."}
{"text":"Not bad place. I had a veggie burger and salad combo with my usual gin and tonic. Service was friendly and fast. I wish this place didn't give me that generic chain-restaurant vibe - I think it had to do with its overall interior aesthetics - it's just too run of the mill and it makes me feel like I'm at Boston Pizza or something."}
{"text":"The beer was really good (there was one I would have taken home, but they were out of growlers for this particular brew).  The food was pretty average.  I had a small steak with a salad, which was good but certainly forgettable.  I did like the deep fried mac and cheese, but who wouldn't?  The service was really good - every one who visited our table encouraged us to sample whatever we wanted, and seemed unbothered by the back and forth required to make it happen.  I would give the food a 2.5, but I'm scoring a 3 b/c the beer was great."}
{"text":"You beer remains fantastic.  But I stopped in today to have your second-to-none Fish Tacos... and oh dear.  What the hell happened?  Your new recipe is sadness.  No jalapenos and Deep Fried??  You went from literally the best fish tacos in the city to something I'd get on a food truck in front of city hall.  I hope the rest of the menu isn't as drastically changed...don't fix what ain't broke."}
{"text":"To be clear I'm reviewing this place as a brunch spot. I've come twice for weekend brunch, and was disappointed. The eggs weren't cooked properly, the service was slow, and we had to ask twice for our bill. Decidedly underwhelming."}
{"text":"So I was at this place for breakfast/brunch one day. The server came to greet us and I gave him my order. He was doing a bunch of stuff with the iPad and took forever to take the order (I honestly think it'd be faster if he just write down the order). After I repeated my order twice with overly long pauses, he then asked what kind of eggs I wanted... the dish I ordered didn't come with eggs and there were only 4 things on the menu, so I don't get how one can be confused - bad sign. I repeated my order for the 3rd time (actually 4 times if I had to count the time i told him the type of sausages I wanted).  After 30 minutes of waiting in a restaurant that wasn't overly busy, the dishes finally arrived. There were problems with both our orders - side orders and how we wanted the food prepared were wrong. We told the server about the issues, he seemed helpless and wandered over to the manager(?) for assistance. Instead of acknowledging the incompetence service, we were told to \"relax, it's just sausages and bacon\". Sure...I guess we'll just take our business elsewhere. I can't tell you if the food is any good since we left without touching the it. And no, it did not look good."}
{"text":"Good location, large upscale sportsbar, brewhouse type venue. Lots of seating, and good for large groups. Atmosphere was fun.

Varied menu but food is their downside. Mussels dry and lacked broth, risotto mushy, most positive comment from our table of 6 was \"just OK\" .

Very Good beer options.

Service was friendly, professional and efficient. 

Value would have been good if quality of food was better. 

Would be a good option if beer and sporstbar atmosphere are your main concerns."}
{"text":"Great place. Very family friendly. House brews are a bit hit and miss but have great guest taps. Beer is a bit pricey. Food is fairly standard but high quality pub food."}
{"text":"The service was really good and the beer was fine. Food was m-e-h (I had a gristly and fatty steak sandwich, companion had fish tacos that were average at best, and we shared mussles, which were alright). 

I found it way too expensive for the quality. There are a lot of great pubs in the area at around the same price point or cheaper, so not sure I'd rush back.

It's cool that you can purchase growlers to take home... that could come in very handy."}
{"text":"This place has a nice vibe. Initially there is a bit of a \"hoppy\" smell, probably because they brew their own beer there. Once you get used to that its a pretty nice place. Really good French onion soup! They have great drinks and not too pricey. It's nice to see this place stick around for a while now on the Danforth. Great location and cool concept. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Not cheap but decent value.   

Large, well-done, interior.  Very good staff. 

Great beer selection, of course.  Just had an amazing IPA (Medusa), house-brewed, only 5%, citrusy and hoppy, just perfect. 

I can only vouch for the burger and fries, which were fine.  

If, like me, you don't like the Danforth's restaurants much, this could be your go-to."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here.  This place is brand new and looks it.  The décor is upscale, clean, and neat.  There are 20+ taps, many of which are their own brew (currently brewed off site, but soon be done in house I am told).  The \"works\" are the first thing you see.  The food during both of my experiences has been good, but not great.  I can't say \"hey, make sure you try the _____\" unless the \"_____\" is the beer.  There are some really great beers here including Dead Elephant which is one of my favorites, is about as hoppy as I can tolerate, and has a cool story behind the weird name (I'll write it at the bottom of this review).

Pros: 
Spacious.
Clean.
Rotating Craft Beer Selection. 
Good service.
Convenient (right off of the subway).

Cons:
Spacious.  This is both a pro and a con I think depending on our mindset.  When busy it is BUSY, when empty it is a little large.   
Food has improved, but has room to grow.

If I lived on Danforth it would be a haunt of mine, as it stands I'll probably pop in for a pint whenever I'm nearby.  

So, the Dead Elephant:
You might hear the word \"jumbo\" and think of large, and you should.  That is because there was once a giant African Elephant that toured with PT Barnum who's name was Jumbo.  He was the largest in captivity and a worldwide sensation.  So much so that the world Jumbo just became synonymous with big.  While on tour in 1885 he was hit by a train and killed in St. Thomas Ontario, which is where the beer is from.  The train was also killed."}
{"text":"Had the Grilled Sausage & Warm Pretzel Plate (beer mustard included). Pretty good, sparkling water is complimentary, service was fair but not very enthusiastic."}
{"text":"Beer was mediocre, food was mediocre, service was fantastic.  Had their ipa and blonde water backed same falvours.  Shared nachos not awesome.  Would probably go back but only because the service was good."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, waited 20min just for water and an hour for our food. Really upsetting was an unapologetic, argumentative manager with an attitude. Needles to say, we will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and good food. When I asked for an IPA the server brought two samples to try. The steak frites was well cooked and flavourful. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This place has a great brewery atmosphere, something sorely lacking the The Danforth.  They make their own beer, right across the glass wall from the main dining room.  Their own beers are fresh and tasty - you can taste the freshness! 

We had some usual pub fare with the beer, wings, burger, etc.  It was all good quality and decent, including the price.  The service was standard.  Great place to get a microbrew and some pub food!"}
{"text":"Might be the worst microbrewery in Ontario. I sure hope it is. It would be sad to have even worse beer than this. Oh well, at least it's in the east end."}
{"text":"Was here for a school party earlier in the year and had great service and drinks the whole time. They have a great space on the second floor that can accommodate larger groups. Got really addicted to their mac and cheese poppers that was going around at the time, and will probably get them the next time I'm back for food.

Recently was back for a drink at the bar and got introduced to the Winter Ale they have on tap. It had a smooth clean taste with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. Bonus for not having a weird aftertaste either. It was delicious and I probably finished it way too fast. My friend had a flight of beer and Dark Horse Espresso APA got a thumbs up also. Will be back to try the rest of the craft beers!"}
{"text":"Nailed it. 

I was impressed with Louis Cifer right from the get-go. Firstly,  sparking water is available in jugs at no charge. That's a nice perk I haven't seen in Toronto. 

The service here was fantastic. I was asking about the beer on tap and samples of each beer came my way. Again, that's a nice perk. And the selection of local beer is really good. 

I ended up getting a Pommies cider on tap (I've also never seen Pommies on tap) and it came with a layer of shaved ice on top. Perfect. 

I ordered the Brew Works burger. It was packed full of flavour and definitely hit the spot. It's more in line with a prime rib burger like Harbord Room or Marben, which is totally my jam. It was a bit greasier than I wanted and I ordered it medium rare (it came medium or medium well), but with that much flavour, it didn't matter. 

If you're getting the burger, nix the cheese - it's already chalk full of fatty deliciousness. 

My friend got the carrot ginger soup, which I sampled (obviously). Really good stuff. 

I'm giving this place 5 stars. It's maybe a 4 or 4.5, but I think the overall rating is too low for the food and drink experience we got. 

If you're on the Danforth, give this place a shot for dinner or drinks."}
{"text":"Love going to Louis Cifer! The food is amazing, the beer is tasty and the staff is very friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is always dead, but against my better judgement (and because I didn't feel like Greek food), I stopped in here for lunch. I was the only table in the entire place at 12-1pm. I ended up paying $20 for a veggie burger that was dry and lacked flavour. Service was meh. I didn't have any beer, so I can't speak to that, but I really don't think I would go back to do so."}
{"text":"Came here after dinner to meet up with some friends...it was nice and roomy for 7 people. 

We ordered a plate of Rosemary fries to share, which wasn't bad, however when served it was room temperature and did not taste like it just came out of the fryer.

BF had ordered a couple of beers, which he was not impressed at all with."}
{"text":"Sitting at our table right now, writing our review instead of eating. We're a group of six and ordered burgers and sandwiches an hour ago. A literal hour. Not only that, our server told us they were plating our food ten minutes ago. I can't imagine it's going to be hot when it finally arrives. 

Details to follow if we ever receive our food."}
{"text":"I was walking on the Danforth with a friend and decided to walk in here as we had heard some good reviews about this place. I was not disappointed, I had a pint of the dirty blonde beer which according it my waitress was one of their more popular beers and it was also brewed in house. The beer was a mix of a wheat beer and a lager and it had an interesting coffee undertone. I would recommend checking trying a pint.  For food I had something off of the featured menu, the brisket sandwich with frites. The meat was tender and the frites were crispy but I found the bun was a little soggy. Saying that it was a great dining experience and I will be back here again."}
{"text":"I've been to this new restaurant 4 times - BEST FISH n CHIPS ever - I had the beet salad and it was GREAT!!!   No charge for sparkling water (nice)... now, I don't drink beer but my partner does, and enjoyed it.  I have only been in mid-day so it wasn't overly crazy-busy but service was fine - nice staff.  Love the decor.  Had a manager check in on us to make sure we were all good - no complaints here - and we will definately go back."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Louis Cifer.  It opened in October 2014 and it's been on my radar for a while.

The bathroom signs are fun.

In addition to selling beer from other providers, they brew their own beer onsite.  You can buy a growler to take home.  Gord started with the ESB (and liked it) and I stuck with the Original Sin Blonde (which I liked).  His favourite was the Retox IPA (an one-off).

Gord ordered with Mac 'n Cheese Poppers.  I had one and it was good.  Gord enjoyed them and said he'd get them again.  Gord and I both got Jumbo Wings.  I got mine with Stout Sweet BBQ sauce and they were messy and delicious.  Gord's were Lemon Salt 'n Pepper Dry.  I had one and it was good.  It had just a hint of seasoning and looked and tasted grilled.  We would both get them again.  I found the wingette was a bit small but the drumettes were closer to \"jumbo\".

I was still hungry so ordered a piece of chocolate cake.  It was just okay and I wouldn't order it again.  The berries and whipped cream were good.

The place was jammed and there was lots of friendly staff buzzing around checking on how things were which was nice.  Alex was our server and she took excellent care of us.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place, been here a few times and it's always a great time!!  Flight Deck all the way"}
{"text":"Awesome spot on the danforth.

This is definitely my local watering hole. Their in house made lager is delicious. Service is great almost always and the food from what I have tried is yummy and hits the spot."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to see this place doing well. All the restaurants that went into this spot did not see similar success. I stopped by for late drinks with friends. I can only comment on the ambiance since I was having water. It's very laid back, lively and has TV's all around. Great place to meet a group of friends when you want to have a causal night."}
{"text":"The beer was below average at best. As for the brewmaster, it was a little left to be desired. Their IPA was week, and didn't have the bite it should have. The food was also average. It was reasonable, but didn't have much of a wow factor. The place has a great space and layout for a sports bar. Worth a visit if you're on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I'm so glad my first experience at Louis Cifer was well after they opened.  I find too often reviews happen when a restaurant is still working out its growing pains.

First of all, I'm not a beer drinker but hubby and my friend who joined us definitely are and they enjoyed the chance to sample a few beers before committing to a pint, and both fell in love with the Nickelbrook Malevolent Imperial dark IPA.

We all had burgers, but I wanted mine as rare as they were willing to serve it, and the server made a point of asking the kitchen if they would cook it rare, and they did, which was great.  The other burgers were well done, not medium rare as was supposed to be the standard, so I'm glad I asked for rare.

The meat had a garlic kick and was nicely but not overly seasoned, letting the taste of the charred meat come through.

The potato bun for the burgers may seem non-descript, but it was a perfect texture to hold the juicy and hefty burger.  

The bacon was wonderfully smokey and flavourful, crisp but not overcooked.

The shoestring fries had a fair bit of Rosemary which the guys liked but I wasn't a fan of.  

The only issue we had with the meal was that they charged $1.50 for garlic aioli but did not mention it was an extra charge when offered as a potential topping for the burgers or for dipping the fries.  Certainly not worth complaining about but if you don't think you will use it, don't bother.

Had no room for desserts, but we were told they are made in house.

We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I think some of these other reviews below are spammerific. 

This place opened two weeks ago and I honestly was really impressed with just about everything - the food and drinks were good, the menu was unique, the decor nice and the waitstaff super good. 

Our food came out within 15 mins of ordering and the drinks came immediately, so it seems as if they've already worked out some of the kinks mentioned in reviews below.

This place has been so many different venues, it used to be the 417 Lounge. The decor and layout have changed substantially and it looks great.

Both the hostess and waitress were extremely nice and chatty. Not to mention, this place was PACKED for a Sunday night! Full house.

I tried one of the weekly drink specials which was slushie cider (cider run through a slushie machine) = delicious idea, kept my drink cold and no ice to dilute the flavour. My friend tried the house blonde on tap and thought it was great.

Great addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could. We came here and ordered a full meal and then ordered their featured pommie slushies and they were disgusting to put it mildly. I pretty much never send anything back but this was exceptionally horrible so I felt compelled to escalate. Long story short the waiter had to get the manager over and she refused to take the item off of our bill... Really dude? At least take it off the bill of your patrons can't drink it. I'd give this place 0 stars, hope it was worth the the $5 of overhead brew works."}
{"text":"I came here by myself on the day before Christmas Eve.  I'm an old woman with special needs which include: Need beer in order to shop for Christmas presents otherwise I will roll in a ball in the backseat of my car and pretend I was mugged. Also need a clean toilet at shopping Base Camp . 

I decided to \"Shop Local\" for my crotch spawn this year. Fuck malls. Last year I lost my temper in a parking lot and I am ashamed to say it wasn't even at Yorkdale where you can righteously lose your shit cuz it's part of the process and everyone knows it and embraces it as a sport.  It was at that lame Eglinton/Vic Park dump where I was circling for 10 minutes for a spot and some beeyutch pulled in seamlessly off Victoria Pk and STOLE my place that I was hovering over. And she had the audacity to yell at me when I tried to claim what was mine. I know you don't care but I still think about it and it gets me worked up in a white rage. 
Breathe.

So this year shop local was my plan. Relax. Go take yo'self for a nice lunch. Have a pint. Be kind. Make merry. Ho Ho Ho.

I was excited to try this place because of its name, all devil-like Louis Cifer...Lucifer, like the DeNiro character in the movie Angel Heart, do you remember? When Mickey Rourke was hot and that girl from the Cosby show showed her tits? Okay I IMDB'd this mess and it was spelled Louis Cyphre but same kind of idea so I was expecting some kind of Louisiana swamp-like atmosphere, something sexy and dangerous. But this place not so much. Giant open concept with repurposed barnwood. Sigh and eye roll. It had a big chain vibe with all its merch but! Super clean washrooms so I'm not complaining.

I sat at the bar like a harlot and ordered an IPA. There own brand wasn't hoppy enough (they give samples) so I opted for a Dead Elephant which had more tits to it. I ordered a chicken sandwich which promised to be diabolical in keeping of the theme. I liked the bun. Buns are important. They should be soft and smooth without sesame seeds. I would have like the chicken to be crispier though. There was a sweetness which turned out to be a relish of some sort...could have been more Satanic, but still a good try. Fries: weird and little, like soggy frites. I have mixed feeling for that particular genre of fries, it's hard to do well, they need to be crispy if they are skinny. But I'm not that picky, I will eat all the fries any time any how.

All in all, nice place for lunch or hanging. You can bring an old woman there and she will be happy to sit at the bar and Instagram all the cocktails. Oh! They use wieners to garnish their Caesars, #goodtimes."}
{"text":"Hey Louis Cifer,

First off, cute name. (I wonder how many people know \"Louis Cifer\" is a homophone for \"Lucifer.\" More on this later.) So, we went to your establishment for brunch yesterday. Wow. Taxed by the demands of a half-empty restaurant, you couldn't even handle getting us brewed coffee within the first half our of being seated. (Our waitress cited a large, unexpected party for the absence of coffee, or coffee cups to serve it in.) To make matters worse, it was at least a full hour after we placed our orders before we finally got our food. When we did, we all got french fries instead of home fries, again because of unexpected demand. Did the manager come around to apologize for any of this? Nope. How about coffees on the house to make up for this bare-minimum failure in service? Negative. Now, did I enjoy the Dark Horse Espresso APA, which I wound up ordering in lieu of my coffee that never came? Yes, I actually did. Did I enjoy the company I was with? Absolutely. Unfortunately, that's not reason enough for me to come back. Ever. So, Louis Cifer, our casual visit with you for brunch really did feel like a deal with the devil. Congratulations. We'll be seeing you again when hell freezes over."}
{"text":"Definitely a 4 Star experience because of the selection of beers on taps! Here at Louis Cifer Brew Works, you can do a beer flight of 4 for $10 from any beers they have on taps. The selection is huge as this includes beers from other local breweries!

The vibe is friendly and inviting. Bartender is really knowledgeable and patience. So if you have any question about tasting profile or what to order, don't hesitate to ask.

We were here on a Friday around 4 pm and it was not busy but the place was packed when we leave at 6 pm! 

I cannot comment on the food as all I needed was beers!

Thai PA (Coconut Lemongrass)
Raspberry+Rosehip Hefe
Extra Special Bitter
Witcraft Belgian Wheat
Dark Horse Espresso Pale Ale
Original Sin Blonde
American Gothic Brown Ale
Oasthouse Crop Duster (The only one on my flight that is not by LCBW)

Love the catchy names. The Dark Hose Espresso has light with just a hint of coffee which was interesting and we enjoyed most of beers!

Definitely one of the better options for beer lovers if you are in The Danforth area. For real beer geek, The Only Cafe still a better choice. But if you want to have a place for a date night. LCBW probably will be a much better choice"}
{"text":"Large open modern space fit to serve many, but it was far from full this particular sunday afternoon. Beer and service were good. We split the pretzel and sausage dish; it was okay. I would be happy to return for beer, but the food was just standard pub fare. Sunday night movies seem like a great offering."}
{"text":"not a bad place for drinks and some snacks, pleasant hipsterish decor... the lemon pepper wings were good.  lightly fried with no batter, and seasoned with real lemon juice and pepper... it was so basic but so good, none of that crappy artificial lemon pepper  seasoning.

tacos were very light... not heavy and fish was not battered up..  fried mac and cheese was good and the spicy real hot peppers in the ketchup was a nice surprise...  price is not the best, but i dont really expect great value or prices when you go to a place like this... its decent.  worth a try."}
{"text":"We went there on a Sunday with reservations and were seated right away. The server greeted us and recommended some drinks. My wife had already decided on the cider slushy but I wanted to give a flight a chance. While I really only enjoyed one of the 4 that came in the set I was able to get a feel of the selections they had. 

The food was up next. We had the mac 'n cheese poppers and the cheddar dip for starters. The duo of these two supported 4 people easily. For the main dishes we had the Hell's Kitchen chicken burger, Brew Works Burger and a kale salad. 

All the food was delicious and I would highly recommend this place.  Luckily it wasn't to busy but I can see how it can fill up quick. 

Great food. Great service."}
{"text":"Beer here is top notch, why anybody complains about the beer beats me. Although I've only been here twice it definitely is a great place to go. Had the burger (very good) chicken noodle soup (bit salty) detox salad (okay) My friend ordered the fish tacos a second time and noticed the fish wasn't as good as the first time she had it. So i guess you could say there might be some inconsistencies with the food. Ill be back though to try more of the menu and for the great ambience! Good place overall!"}
{"text":"You must have some audacity to open up a non-Greek themed bar on the Danforth.  How dare you!  And to top it off, there is the word play on the devil himself...for those who can't follow...let me spell it our  LoUisCIFER!!!!  Yes...that name in Greek Orthodox central.  Audacity indeed!  :))

Name aside, this place is really nice.  Very well put together place - nice decor and upper party area.  They have a Gastropub menu and yes, their own microbrewery.  The suds are pretty good.  I like the Original Sin (a blond...go figure), and the Stout.  On top of that, they carry a good line of local brews too.  For those of you looking to tie one on with Blue, Coors, and Export - please leave and make your way down the street and drink out of the local gutters.

The food here is good.  Their deep fried mac and cheese is a million calories stand out.  Their burgers are pretty good and their daily specials is a change from burnt meat on a stick with garlic sauce.

For those of you looking for something different on the Danforth, show your own audacity and see you here! 
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here for my aunts birthday last month. It was pretty meh. I was kind of confused why when she picked a place on the danforth it wasn't Greek! but anyway..

They're clearly known for their beer here; so obviously I got wine :) Just not a beer person but it was good! My brother ordered some home made like root beer or something and hated it and tried to send it back and they gave him some issues so obviously my mom being my mom made a bit of a stink and they brought him something new with no charge. 

I ordered an ahi tuna salad. It was mediocre at best. I love my ahi tuna and the colour of this one did not look how it usually looks but nonetheless I ate it anyway. My boyfriend ordered some sandwich that the waitress warned him was really spicy so he was excited because he loves spicy food. He said it wasn't spicy at all. I tried a bite and agreed which is funny because I am so sensitive to spicy food so the fact that she warned him and even I didn't find of spicy was kind of puzzling. He even brought it up to her but she just kind of shrugged it off. 

For such a mediocre experience I don't think I'd return but I'm sure it's a great place for beer drinkers!"}
{"text":"Not great. I've been here twice and the first time the service and food were just ok. The second time was much worse. Server was missing in action for large amounts of time during our meal. Burger and fries (pretty standard food, right?) was bland and the fries were horrible - soggy, cold and no seasoning. We noticed a few people get seated then had no service and got up and left."}
