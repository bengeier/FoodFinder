{"text":"Food was great and reasonably priced. We had a group of 40 and the staff was super attentive to our needs. Rich the manager was great to work with."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences I have had in a really long time. The place is unassuming from the outside tucked away in a strip mall, but I assure you if you give it a shot you will not be disappointed. To start out the service was great. Our server was the best we have had in a really long time. Very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. Also very passionate about the restaurant as well as the rest of the staff. Not sure if it is family owned or not but is has that feel. Had live music which we all enjoyed. A very unexpected surprise.   The food itself was amazing. We ordered garlic knots and drunkbread and both disappeared almost instantly. I had shrimp and garlic ravioli that tasted fresh, homemade, and super delicious. The complimentary bread with oil and vinegar was a great side to pair with ravioli, and also great to sop up the rest of that creamy sauce with. Friends had the chicken and veal parmesan, both of which were equally happy with their selections. I tasted both and their dishes and liked them a lot as well. Their marinara was really fresh and flavorful. To finish the meal I ordered the tiramisu and was not disappointed. The ladyfingers were moist but not mushy nor hard on the inside, just perfectly spongey as another reviewer posted (and my reason for prdering this in the first place over my goto cannoli).  That was a great finish to an even better meal.   We all thoroughly enjoyed our food and overall experience at Mieles and would recommend it again. Great food, amazing staff/owners, and overall great experience. Moving to this area soon and checking out the local spots and happy to say we found a gem. We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"The food is very good. we are fans of the chicken gorgonzola and the veal toscana.  the linguini and clam sauce is good.  garlic knots are very good.  Fried calamari is excellent, plain but high quality.  the bread is outstanding.  The waiter and the staff are outstanding.  They go far out of their way to help you if you have food problems.  My wife can not eat black pepper.  They have always made sure her food is without it and even the cook double checked every thing she was using.  I have not had that kind of service for a long time.  It does not look prepossessing when you walk in, but once you get back to the dining area it is very nice.  It is quiet and very comfortable."}
{"text":"We picked this place based on the reviews and were sorry. The one good thing was the bread. The garlic knots needed flavor. The chicken with eggplant was salty and not as tender as I would have liked. We did not like the sauce on the spaghetti side dish. Would rather have had Ragu. Was very disappointed with the tiramisu- soggy without flavor and too much chocolate. Will never go back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Very fresh and great portions. Service was the best I have experienced in a long time. Can't wait to bring friends."}
{"text":"I have tried this place now twice for delivery and pickup and their pizza is delicious! I haven't been served in the restaurant yet and it looks ok inside but this is my new replacement for any other to go pizza places... The first pizza i ordered was no longer warm , took too long to deliver but was still delicious so i decided to pick up next time. If you are looking for a place who cares about ingredients this is a good choice. The size is great and pizza takes just as good the next day after warming up in the oven"}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant! A true hidden gem. I've yet to have an Italian restaurant in AZ really impress me until now. It can go blow-to-blow with my favorites back in Boston.   We ordered the calamari, which was one of the best I've had; it wasn't over-breaded nor overcooked. For entree I had the veal parmesan. Was a very good portion and, like the calamari, wasn't over-breaded. The marinara sauce was also very impressive. More sweet notes than acidic. Certainly homemade.   For dessert we had tiramisu and cheesecake, both made from scratch. The tiramisu was unreal. The cheesecake was delicious and very rich.   The owners are a great couple who engage us in conversation. Really personable people. The food is all homemade and cooked-to-order. Absolutely worth waiting a little longer. Prices are very fair given the quality of food and portion sizes.   Highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews we thought we would give this place a try.  We went to the new location on Dobson and Guadalupe.  The food was wonderful and the service was excellent.  My husband and I were there for lunch on our anniversary, and when my husband mentioned that to the gentleman serving us (who we think was the owner or manager), he gave us a complimentary dessert!   I had the Fettuccini Alfredo with Sausage. The sauce was deliciously creamy and the sausage was nicely seasoned.  My husband had the Spinach Ravioli and added meatballs. The ravioli were tasty as were the large meatballs, and the sauce was very good.  For our dessert we chose the cannoli, which I've never had before, and it was so good. The cannoli were crisp and the filling was smooth and not too sweet.  We truly enjoyed our meal. We plan on going back with family members."}
{"text":"Oh good lord that was awesome!  Very attentive service!  I ordered lasagna hubby got the spaghetti & meatballs!  And to finish you off cheesecake drizzled in chocolate!  Eccellente!!  We will def be back!"}
{"text":"I came up from Rhode Island, for a family occasion and boy was I happy Mieles was near me, I was hoping it had that authentic Italian taste to its sauce ! SAUCE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME, it's all in the sauce and Mieles delivered along with pasta al dente ! And you can deny the exceptional customer service the owners are great individuals, accomplished and still passionate about what they do, Seeing these owners proud of their food is persuading, I have to come back and try another dish whenever I'm in town again. I am proud to say I am a happy tourist from Rhode Island who really wasn't expecting a place like Mieles to be here in Arizona! Thanks Jeff and Terry, along with your GREAT AND TALENTED kitchen staff !"}
{"text":"Best Italian food and hospitality we've had in a long time! We had garlic knots, Cesar salad, lasagne and chicken zingara (gluten free) for dinner. The cheesecake and tiramisu were phenomenal! Garlic knots were like they were supposed to be, lasagne like Nana made with fresh made sausage. Chicken Zingara was wonderful flavor with moist chicken. Oh an in house fresh made bread! Wow, wow, wow!!! Must visit this hidden gem! Great lunch pricing and they had a huge banquet room."}
{"text":"We arrived and were greeted by Rich.  Very nice man, very attentive and made sure our drinks were filled in a timely manner.  Our meal was served with perfect timing, appetizer, salad and then the Entree without making us feel rushed.  My wife ordered Zucchini Slices - Lightly battered and fried zucchini slices. Served with ranch for our appetizer.  Delicious! For her appetizer Butternut Squash Ravioli Stuffed with fresh butternut squash and ricotta served in our homemade tarragon cream sauce. And she loved it!! For me it was the Veal Toscano - A veal cutlet is tenderized and pan seared with prosciutto, artichoke hearts and mozzarella then served in a white wine sauce. Absolutely delicious!!! Homemade italian bread w/olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We will be returning in the near future"}
{"text":"Don't go unless you can afford to spend several hours! The service was ridiculously SLOW...no one came to take our drink order for 15 minutes then it took another 15 minutes to order. THEN it took 30 minutes to get bread and our salads. The entire meal lasted over 2 hours and we weren't sitting around chatting. Even people that arrived long after we did, ordered and ate and left before us! The food was so-so, but the cannoli and limoncello cake were delicious."}
{"text":"We tried this on a Groupon and were very pleased. At first the service was spotty; they were obviously short-staffed and no one took our order for a while. But they more than made up for it with good food and friendly service. Lasagne was tasty, huge portion; pizza very good. Sinfully good chocolate torte. Warning: don't fill up on the delicious bread before the meal arrives. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing little gem in the neighborhood! Best pasta I have had in Arizona, try the pink sauce. I spent 5 years on the East Coast so I am picky about Italian. Our waitress was top notch! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"NEW LOCATION. The original Miele's was in Tempe but recently moved to Mesa. (I didn't realize that when I called in my order so ended up going to the wrong location at first.) The Miele's that is still operating in the Tempe location is a totally different restaurant, not affiliated with the original. A bit confusing to customers? Indeed. And I don't think it's right for the fake Miele's to be piggybacking on the original Miele's reputation and essentially stealing its customers. But I digress. The REAL Miele's, now in Mesa, still has the same menu and lunch bargains that I have enjoyed for years, and they apologized profusely and genuinely for the location confusion. I loooove their garlic knots, lasagna, salad, and house dressing. Miele's in Mesa...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very rarely am I blown away by restaurants, especially when it comes to Italian, but this place is truly a hidden gem! My husband is 100% Italian so needless to say, we are very picky when it comes to pasta and sauces. We both did a build your own pasta plate, I had vodka sauce with penne and sausage and my husband did linguini with pesto, sausage, and shrimp, and both dishes were to die for! On top of that, the homemade bread was ridiculously amazing and WARM! Service was excellent, atmosphere was great - we will definitely be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was an off night, but I would not recommend it. We made reservation on a Saturday night. There was not that many people. We got seated immediately. Then the sever took our order and disappeared for 30 mins. Our food came with a side salad, but our server never got back to us. Other guests came after us got their salads way before us. We tried to make eye contact with our server, but he kept ignoring us and finally 30 mins later... He told another sever to check on our salad. Within a few mins, our food came too. Food was not that great. Chicken Toscana was too salty and the Pasta Carbonara was was just warm and was too creamy. We kinda felt sick after we ate our food. Then our server finally decided to pay some attention to us and asked if we need anything. I hate giving bad reviews, but this place was a complete disappointment."}
{"text":"I order delivery from them all the time. The food is GREAT!! But they forgot my bread in the last order."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place while in the area and one look outside I had concerns,  then once inside only one couple in the bar area. So we stuck it out. The service was great, but than again it was just us two and one child. We tried the bruchetta and I had way better. I never had it with onions which I removed and lacked flavor. We got bread after, and that was good and I ordered the chicken marsala,  my daughter got chicken  parm, and mac and cheese for my gd. We both got a side salad, which was very simple,  more lettuce and that was it with their house Italian dressing. My plate lacked the flavors of marsala and was salty, we also for a side of spaghetti which the sauce was way to tart! The chicken parm, my daughter wasn't happy either.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Good prices, food was OK, staff was not very attentive for how small the restaurant is. It is also excessively quiet, and other conversations were easily heard. We also had a ten min \"wait\" even though there were only three tables filled... odd."}
{"text":"Favorite italian in the valley. I'm vegan and get pasta with marinara and garlic knots with no cheese. Pasta is cooked properly and the flavors are there--nothing straight out of a can. I always get takeout and delivery."}
{"text":"Terri was our server and she was amazing. The ambiance was great and the food was good. I had the shrimp and garlic ravioli and my husband had chicken parmigiana. Both dishes were definitely homemade and delicious. Price was good for the size of portion and entrees come with salads and bread. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We ordered a delivery order to try them out: Margherita pizza, some herb bread, and a tiramasu for dessert.  Pizza was ok-just like a little crisp to a crust, but this one was very thin, and I think the sauce made it limpy. Flavors and crust were good though.  Herb bread was very good, lots of butter, olive oil, and seasoning.  Tiramasu was outstanding - more than enough for two and just a perfect end to our meal.  Delivery was quick, online ordering very easy, and would recommend - there's care and love in the food and it was a fine dinner experience."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.  Buffet was very cool and reasonably priced with 3 pastas, 2 pizzas, soup and salad. Lunch menu is very large and reasonably priced too, all my companions said it was good. Now the negatives, they don't start lunch until 1130, which must places know is about 30 minutes too late.  Except for the buffet, it takes eat too long to get your food.  60+ minutes just to eat doesn't work for a working person's lunch break.  Once, and if, they accept the differences between Italian for lunch and Italian for dinner, they could be really successful.  Until then, go with the buffet so you don't get in trouble for a 90 minute lunch.  Also, the server was relatively flat and lacking in personality."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I wanted to try based on the reviews we read from Yelp.  We managed to head there for dinner last night.  It was very very good. Service was amazing, food was hot and fresh and it was very reasonably priced.  Our waiter Rich was very attentive and made sure we experienced a great time.  I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First off, the food was AMAZING. I've been to Italy a few times, and I'd say the food was definitely on par. The chicken Parmesan was crispy and delicious. The meat sauce is made with Italian sausage, which was incredible as well.   My family was a large party and they was so accommodating. The owner was our server, and he couldn't have been any nicer. Some people in our party don't eat gluten and the owner was happy to accommodate everyone.   We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is awful.  Tough crust and my cheese slid off my pizza in one disgusting mass.   Tried a bite, i mean i paid $20 for this...thick, gummy and just not pleasant.  Not going here again.  Ordering pizza hut.  Cause it is better than this"}
{"text":"Very friendly owner, amazing food and a really comfortable atmosphere. You will be guaranteed full by the end of the meal! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I have been a longtime customer of Miele's, for the last four years.  My whole family loves this place.  The food is always great. They are on Grub Hub for delivery.  I find the delivery service to be superb.  The one driver knows me and my family. She always brings my dogs little treats. The food reminds me of homemade. I love the Butternut Squash ravioli. The sauce is beyond divine."}
{"text":"This was my very 1st time eating from here. Had a delivered lunch of the Lunch Meatballs + Lunch Bruschetta, both were great. The two meatballs were a perfect size to just have alone (of course I didn't) and the sauce was so rich and perfect! The Bruschetta was super flavorful and sent separate, which is appreciated. I do look forward to actually going in to sit and eat! So far to go was great and would recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the city of Mesa, great Italian and older American music. Food to die for. If you want to know how Italian food taste ? This restaurant knows how to get close to 100% ."}
{"text":"OMG just had the strawberry cheese cake so delicious ,oh my  goodness and the portions.....this is all I'm saying."}
{"text":"Tired the Italian restaurant with my mother. Good pieces, great food, and even better service. The restaurant is clean and family owned. The owners are friendly, helpful and great people. A great place for lunch, date nights, and family dinners."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had a wonderful experience here. The food is AMAZING and such a good value for their extremely reasonable prices. Service was extremely friendly too, the place has that nice family owned feel. I overheard the owner greeting and chatting with a table of regulars sitting next to us. Love that! The only thing slightly lacking is the ambiance as it kind of feels like a hotel from the 90s inside, but that's no reason to dock a star. We will be back for sure!! Try the chocolate tiramisu, it's to die for (and under $4 for a large \"half\" slice)!"}
{"text":"I just love the food here. Pizza is delicious. The marinara is delicious. The meatball sandwiches as well.   I have been craving a good meatball sandwich for years and have been looking for one since Fazolis closed. I think I've found it. Although it did need more marinara sauce this is easily fixed."}
{"text":"This place looks a little worrying at first but if you want a quiet place to enjoy some really good Italian food this is the place. They have very good bread and salad with each meal which is really nice. For the pasta they have a lot of choices and all the ones I have tried have been really good. When people ask for a good Italian food place this is the one I recommend. My biggest thing for people who have not been here is not to be scared away thinking that they are closed because it is well worth it"}
{"text":"Oh how I wish I lived closer.  This place is by far the best Italian food I have ever had.   Found myself in Mesa and dinner long overdue. Pushed Yelp nearby and  reviews led me here    Cute, clean and friendly.  We were promptly greeted and seated by Terry.  They have tables and booths.   There is a separate bar and banquet room.  As others have noted the garlic knots are the bomb  they come with marinara, but awesome just by themselves.  I got the chicken parmigiana it was heaven covered in super flavorful arbiata sauce.  So good.  Mom had the select a pasta, you select your noodles, type of sauce there are about 7 and you can select additional ingredients such as black olives red or white onion, each less than.50.   Portions are great They serve dinners with a perfect side salad with house Italian dressing.  Fresh baked Italian bread was perfect and oh god good.  There was another couple near by and they were commenting on how good their food was.   He was Italian and loved every bite of his pasta   Wild berry cake was incredible, we got a second piece to take home with our leftover, it was that good.  We will be back, just wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! I had the lasagna, which was hearty and flavorful. My mother had the tortellini, so delicious and rich. Excellent service! The server was very knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"This is excellent Italian food! I went in on election day to have a glass of wine, ordered spaghetti Bolognese, chicken Alfredo and Margherita pizza with sausage, to go. The chicken Alfredo is delicious. Creamy and the chicken is perfect. The Bolognese is delicious as is the pizza. I highly recommend this place. When the owner found out that I was going to be eating this carry out for a couple of days, he threw in an order of ravioli because it holds up better, he said, than my chicken Alfredo. It's all delicious. Wonderful atmosphere. Good wine list. Rich, the bartender/server, was also very attentive and a good conversationalist. The prices are very reasonable and I also enjoyed my complementary garlic knots."}
{"text":"Save your time and money! Went there with a buddy, walked in to a completely empty place...that itself should have been the GIANT RED FLAG. Waiter was absolutely pathetic. Asked us what we wanted to drink, then vanished. We thought he died on the way to get our drinks. Comes back, no bread. Takes our order, vanishes again. Still no other customers other than us 2. Brings us our salads. They were the smallest salads I have ever seen!!! A TOTAL JOKE! Then he vanished again. Now it's been 45 minutes. 2 more customers walk in. A lady comes over and tells us they are busy, LMAO, where, when, how? So we get out Chicken Parmigiana. Small breast, beat to death and a side of pasta. I could fit the potion of pasta in the palm of my hand...again another joke. We should have walked out, left the food there but neither of us ate all day. So---wrapping up this review....DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY OR EFFORT, this place SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"Good Italian, wonderful bread! The strip mall at Dobson and Guadalupe is in need of more updated stores like Miele's. Don't let that deter you from trying this restaurant. The chicken Parmesan was moist and tender. I would have liked angel hair pasta but they serve only thin spaghetti. They serve the bread with oil and basalmic vinegar but you can request butter. The lunch meals come with the bread and a small green salad."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I am a stickler for good customer service and for people who LISTEN AND PAY ATTENTION -- so this review contains elements that reflect my sentiment regarding these things......went to dinner here last night with my GF.  The ambiance of the place is nice and better than most family style Italian food restaurants.  We were seated immediately by who we assumed was our waitress and she immediately asked if we wanted some cocktails -- we ordered and she went to get them at the bar.  Then another waiter comes over and says that he is our waiter and will serve us tonight.  He takes our appetizer order.  Then the waitress come back with our drinks and we tell her that the other guy took our appetizer order.  She says OK but can she take our dinner order.  So we order our salads and entrees with grilled vegetables (an optional and extra charge item), and tell her that we don't want to rush and that we would like to have our cocktails with our appetizer before our dinner elements start to come out.  She says, \"No problem\".  A few minutes later our salads arrive and my GF's salad comes with no dressing on it---WTH??  I also ask, \"where's my antipasto platter?\"  So I guess my appetizer order never got placed.  We ask for salad dressing and wait.  Finally our apps come out and we get two baskets of bread -- one whole loaf which I assume comes with our salad and dinners, and another basket with baguette slices for which I assume is for our antipasto platter.  By now I am a little confused and annoyed, and I have to ask again for salad dressing for my GF.  Oh and BTW, I order a Kilt Lifter Ale and it comes to me and it is a little flat.  I am a craft beer nut so I know flat beer that has been sitting in an open keg for a little longer than it should.  So for my next beer, I order an IPA.  It take some time to get to me and the waitress says, \"sorry for the wait, but they had to tap a new IPA keg\".  I can tell, and that is good for me -- the IPA is nice and cold and fresh and very tasty -- I am happy with this mug of suds.  The antipasto platter is OK -- some nice cheese, especially the chunks of bleu.  Nice proscuitto and salami; nice pickled artichoke hearts.  And a hearty sprinkling of dried cranberries which is OK and on the menu description, but sorta out of character for this platter IMO.  Our entrees arrive -- mine was veal marsala and a side of pasta.  The veal entree was again OK, but not as rich and creamy as I would have liked.  The gravy is thin and weak IMO, and somewhat underseasoned.  The pasta side is overcooked spaghetti with marinara.    My GF orders ravioli with marinara sauce.  Our grilled vegetables never arrive.  And the marinara sauce is not very good IMO.  Now I realize that marinara sauce is made is a zillion different ways and everyone tastes is different.  So maybe this marinara sauce is good, but we did not like it.  I sorta pick out the overcooked spaghetti from the sauce and eat it, but my GF eats only one ravioli and quits.  She says she will wait for a big breakfast for tomorrow morning.  The marinara sauce is overpowering -- very, very thick, and seemingly like canned tomato PASTE, flavored with a little Italian seasoning (oregano, cumin, basil).  So again, it might be good in some other peoples eyes (mouth), but for us, we did not care for it.  So my review here may seem very critical, but in reality, it is just a detailed and an honest expression of my opinions.  All-in-all, this place is OK, I guess."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! The delivery time is always less than an hour (as they estimate). The food is beyond great. And the delivery driver even took the time to re-deliver a cannoli because they didn't feel the first was up to expectations! This is hands-down one of the best places. Worth it for great food and great service."}
{"text":"I've had food from here 3 times, each time I've ordered through doordash.  Pizza with bacon, spinach ravioli and mushroom ravioli.  I was happy with my choices each time.  On the ravioli there was a lot of sauce, great for using up the bread afterwards."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!!  Wear your bigger pants when you go!!  Very large portions with every choice. Try the cheesy garlic bread or the warm bread with oil and vinegar. For dessert go for the cheesecake or the homemade Chocolate Tiramisu. Out of this world!! Friendly staff and the best owners ever!! Mr. Frank does a great job playing music on Fridays and covers so many decades including The Beatles, Clapton and even Green Day!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure! It was delicious and I loved that they didn't bring out the next dish for a while as I usually feel rushed in most restaurants. Great service and fantastic food!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. Best Italian food in the valley. The owners take pride in their food and Rich ( the general manager) makes sure you have a awesome experience.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some amazing food. We had family in town (party of 12) and had a great night. Thanks again rich for a night we will remember"}
{"text":"This was a favorite for years when they were just a restaurant . We had dinner at their place last evening and was disappointed, service was fair, but friendly and they had a lot of take out orders happening I felt that they worked harder on that than they did the customers in the restaurant area. The food was not the same quality and  tasted more like catering food. It was not fresh.  I hope they do well in the party business."}
{"text":"First visit based solely on viewing it on Yelp. All the items I had were good. The appetizer, salads meal and especially dessert. My wife especially enjoyed it. and some of the fine details like the chocolate truffles. She took home samples of the appetizer, (garlic knots), some of the table bread, her gnocchi dinner and would have taken home some of the cheesecake if we had not finished it all. The interior decor was not exactly my bag, but in a restaurant it's really about the food, so I just took that in stride.   What struck me was the differences that I saw there that I don't see other places.   The wide selection of Italian sodas, my wife ordered one and upon tasting it, I regretted that I had not. They had soda flavors I had never heard of. The candied walnuts that were sprinkled on the cheesecake were addictive.   My wife assures me that we will be back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Waiter Jordin great the bread Is fresh and hot. Had the Gorgonzola Chicken excellent.  Will be back"}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant. I believe it is a privately owned restaurant, not a chain.  The pasta is fresh and the sauces are made to order. I always rate an Italian restaurant based upon how well they prepare their lasagna and this place does not disappoint. On my first visit I was surprised to find veal on the menu. I hesitantly ordered it believing it would be over cooked as most places do. Boy was I surprised! It came out perfectly! Moist & tender. Very tastey!  I've been back numerous times since then; each time ordering something different.  I have never been disappointed and neither will you."}
{"text":"I ate Miele's three days in a row.  10\" Margharita pizza with pepperoni one day then I had a 14\" Margharita pizza with sausage the next day on the third day I had the Chicken Zingara.  All very good.   (Update) I have ordered delivery several times in the past few weeks.  10\" pizza with mushroom and a cheddar mozzarella mix and the arribiata sauce.  Grilled Chicken and Veggies.  The garlic knots are very tasty as well."}
{"text":"So far I just ordered over the phone EXCELLENT Customer service by Jeffery! Can't wait till the food is here. Another review coming soon !"}
{"text":"I found this place through the Yelp delivery app. Miele was a name I grew up with. I think they were in construction or disposal company in NJ. Saw the name everywhere while growing up so I thought it was worth a try. I ordered the portobello stuff ravioli. They were tender and had ricotta cheese inside with the mushrooms! The sauce was light and this dish was 100 perfect. My daughter ordered the fettuccine Alfredo. This is a dish that probably best served at the restaurant. The sauce had settled and was just ok. My husband ordered a pizza. They forgot to deliver the pizza with the rest of our order but it was quickly rectified. The pizza was on the thin side and toppings were good. The crust seemed a little too doughy for my liking. I like the fact that the garlic knots were made from pizza dough, don't know for sure but seemed similar to pizza crust. They were done to perfection and very tasty. They were tall and the tops were browned. They might be better if they weren't so close to the heat and still a little on the doughy side. We will order take out again from this place and look forward to visiting the actual location."}
{"text":"Great delivery option from a local small business instead of your normal national pizza franchise chain. The chicken parmesan & the eggplant parmesan are always fantastic! Minestrone soup & a house salad add to the meal nicely."}
{"text":"Amazing homemade bread, sauces and meatballs!  Everything we ate was delicious (eggplant parmesan, linguine and clams, greek salad, meatballs, berry cream cake) and we cant wait to come again. Prices were very reasonable and our server was friendly and helpful.  Nice wine list too"}
{"text":"I learned of this place while trying to use a Restaurant.com credit.  Yelp seemed to have good ratings, so I used the credit and bought a certificate for Miele's.  They center it is in is a bit dodgy.  NW corner of Dobson and Guadalupe.  It's next to the Pawn Shop.  Upon entering the decor is absent.  It's really just a small podium and several blank walls.  What did I get myself into?  But from the podium they led us down a nondescript hall into the dining area.  The decor here was still a bit lacking, but better.  \"Romantic lighting\", several small tables...starting to feel like a bistro!  When we arrived there was quiet live music.  I should comment that the music was really nice.  Not at all Italian, but I liked that the musician wasn't blaring.  It was nice background music that allowed people to have a conversation without yelling.  We were seated at one of a small number of tables.  (Reservations might be a good idea...most of the evening I didn't see more than 1 or 2 empty tables, so I can see them being packed sometimes.)  They have an extensive menu.  Almost too much.  How can a small bistro kitchen cope with so many different dishes and maintain quality?  After looking at sandwiches and pizzas and different chicken dishes and veal dishes I settled on the bolognese.  Properly done this should not be \"spaghetti and meat sauce\".  My wife ordered chicken toscana.  We also got the calamari appetizer.  The calamari was good.  Simple, but good.  Not rubbery at all, nice light crunch of the breading.  Done well.  At the same time they brought out \"house bread\".  They make it themselves.  It's really good.  As good as any bakery.  The entrees came with a house salad.  My wife liked it.  I don't do salads, and they would not substitute for a soup.  I could order a soup, but no substitution.  Annoying.  My bolognese was really good.  Perfect, really.  Portion maybe a bit small, but the pasta was done properly and the bolognese sauce was dead-on.  Very flavorful.  My wife loved her toscana.  I didn't particularly (it was 'ok'), but she was very happy with her choice.  I mean really happy with it!  The bistro is owned by a middle-aged couple.  It's not a chain.  The chef has worked there since before this couple owned it, or so they told me.  I think as long as that chef is there we have a new favorite Italian place.  Yes, they are more expensive than the Olive Garden.  But they are so worth it if you love Italian food.  We are looking forward to trying them again very soon."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for a cheese pizza plain was $17 The cannoli was five dollars  oh had of been made the day before so the shell was not hard. you can go to Caesars and get a cheese pizza for five bucks waited an hour and 40 minutes for our meal  I can say the fettuccine was very good maybe it was just because I was starving and had to wait an hour and 40 minutes for it service was very poor"}
{"text":"We just finished our meal we ordered off UberEATS and it was amazing! I got the chicken toscana and I will be dreaming about it until I have it again! Thank you for making our take out meal like a meal we cooked at home! We will definitely be having dinner there again soon"}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZA!  And service! This is my favorite place for margarita pizza. just  making sure everyone knows that there are 2 locations, the other is just up the road from the Tempe store. I really like this Staff could not have been nicer. I love the food. Thank you so much!!! I will be back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian food around town! Highly recommend it to anyone! Words cannot describe all the flavors in their dishes, you have to try it to understand. In addition to the amazing food, Dawn is an outstanding server. I have never met anyone that nice, caring, and down to earth person before. You won't be disappointed here!!"}
{"text":"This was such a great find. If you are looking for flavorful old-school Italian food this is the place to go to. I loved that you could personalize all the pastas with a bunch of ingredients. The garlic knots were delicious, and everything was very flavorful. Be prepared for humongous portions though."}
{"text":"Let me say that the food is a 4.5 star. I would give it 3 star for ambience and 2 star for timeliness. We went on a Friday night and it wasnt that busy. Took about 30 min just to get shrimp cocktail appetizer. At an hour my fiancee walked out and then our food arrived. I paid for stuff and had it boxed up. I really wish that the food service was just a little bit faster. This place is only 1 mile from my house so I would like to return but I know my fiancee will refuse. I wish this place luck but really try to work on getting food out more promptly. My shrimp ravioli dish was great once I got it home. Also table next to us got pizza and it looked delicious."}
{"text":"Such a cute little restaurant tucked in the middle of the strip mall on the corner of Guadalupe and McClintock.   The restaurant is small but that adds to the cozy and intimate feel.   I chose this place as a special location for a mom-and-daughter date night. We had very friendly, excellent service and will definitely be back!  Ordered: Pane Umbriaco, spaghetti with meatball and the bread pudding.   My daughter said, \"This place is very lovely. I love this place! We should come back soon.\""}
{"text":"Delicious and filling! We got 4 different pasta dishes and we all shared everything.   Fettuccine chicken Alfredo Spaghetti with meat sauce Spaghetti with meatballs Fettuccine with clams in a white wine sauce  All were large sizes and perfect temp. We got a side of bread and a side of meatballs.   All and all it was amazing. 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Local favorite with a fantastic new location! Miele's Bistro has been a neighborhood staple since I was a girl, and now they have a location that matches their amazing culinary skills and friendly, local staff!  Versatile dinning rooms to fit any occasion and a mouthwatering menu!"}
{"text":"I got the meat lover pizza and the sausage on it looked and tasted like dog food  My wife got the lasagna and she said it was very tasty Service was excellent"}
{"text":"Absolutely pitiful customer service. Ridiculously slow and zero apologies from their staff. I left without eating."}
{"text":"Good service but I'm rating it with a one star because the food was not very good, especially for the price $$. For appetizers I ordered some sausages, cold in the middle, they brought me another order of them but they just weren't good, very dry. And I got fried zucchini, no Bueno either. For my entree I got chicken parm which wasn't bad but like I said too $$, you could go to Olive Garden and be more satisfied. Oh! their bread was good so the pizza may be on point but I didn't try?"}
{"text":"Great food and great place. Looks nice and the people are wonderful. They treated my daughter and I very well, even gave my little one some free cookies. Thanks for being so nice. I will be back with all the family next time. I also noticed that they had a wonderful looking bar with many choices for a night out for drinks."}
{"text":"I paid $33 including tip for delivery of eggplant Parmesan and spinach ravioli. The eggplant tasted frozen and was hardly edible. It was very chewy like rubber so it was hard to break down. My husband seen me struggling to bite it was so difficult I started to look like a dog playing with a chew toy. The batter was very basic and was the kind of batter I would expect at a place like sonics similar to their mozzarella sticks but with a tad bit more flavor. Seemed like the cook must be completely careless, tired, or they need to come with a new recipe. The spinach ravioli was a little better but OK at best and lacked flavor. I was very disappointed in the thin rubbery eggplant they called eggplant parmasean. $33 down the drain. I would of called and expressed my concern because I believe in if I pay for something I should like it or try something new. but the guy who took our order didn't seem like a people person over the phone based on his tone and the fact he seemed bothered by my questions about the menu. Not sure if it's because it was late or if that's just his character. That should of been my red flag. Oh well I won't be ordering here again unfortunately it was disgusting. I rather do Oregano's who are full of flavor and deliciousness, too bad they don't deliver."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm going to come off as a bit snobbish here [ok, reading this it's more than a bit] - my apologies and please bear with me in case you're also a latent snob and want someone to talk you into a nice experience..   The photos of meals don't convey a lot of elegance or frippery - a simple plate (I think the same plates we have at home) of whatever was ordered. They had standard red tablecloths for a restaurant Lady and the Tramp would patronize, against the backdrop of an unadorned structure that used to be a (dance hall? retail space? I can't tell...), and across from Goodwill in the strip mall.. so yeah admittedly I was skeptical..   So when I looked at Miele's and my wife said she wanted unpretentious Italian, and her illustration was to avoid \"tablecloths and cloth napkin stuffiness\" I thought well technically yes, but surely this place can't be all that... so it'll be like a happy medium since clearly Yelpers love it - and I live and die by the Yelptuarial tables.   Of course when the moment we walked in we were confronted with the aforementioned cloth everything, we had one of those \"just trust me\" moments - duration of which thankfully is much shorter than in the olden days - and we all had a seat.   First, my mother likes to test people (she refers to this as \"being nice to people\") and the way she apparently be's nice to people at a new restaurant is to say, \"We've never been here before!\" very excitedly, and when the response fails to be suitable (i.e., \"Oh - well, *welcome*!\") she follows up with,\" Is there anything you would like to tell us about?\" (followed by a less than satisfactory \"Um... what.. would.. you.. like to know...?\"), Mom redoubles with, \"Do you... specialize in anything?\" finally resulting in the chagrined admission that our server has just a bit more experience with the restaurant than my mother, but will gamely tell us all she can. In fact she was eager to tell us what she'd tried and thus could personally recommend, and more about the menu, naturally. She was delightful - and very very patient.   Not to be contented with this pleasantness, I joined in my mother's testing when both of us (to my poor wife's embarrassment) ordered When Harry Met Sally style, my mother requesting a dish nowhere to be found on the exhaustive menu (chicken piccata), and me ordering a white sauce rather than marinara with my gnocchi.. and not even a particular white sauce \"just *not* the marinara\". My wife very creatively ordered shrimp and garlic ravioli from the menu.  [First off, yes I inherited my high-maintenance ordering genetically, obviously - so it's not my fault. Second, on Yelp the restaurant encouraged patrons to ask for whatever flitted through our perpetually unsatisfied brains, and you really can't throw an option in front of my mother or me that we won't take.]  Anyway, no questions asked, absolutely happy to make our bespoke dishes: my gnocchi with alfredo was intense and wonderful (perfect for my tastebuds though I don't necessarily recommend it for others since it does lack the brightness of the marinara); my wife was very happy with her ravioli (perhaps a bit more sauce?) - very distinct and balanced flavors; and my mother thoroughly enjoyed her chicken piccata - oh yeah - and she added artichoke hearts... which were not cooked into the dish but added on the side.   *note* I will say, I decidedly did not enjoy the caesar salad - it just seemed pretty lifeless, and not for lack of dressing.   My elitist test for an Italian restaurant is in their tiramisu (my test might be arbitrary and pointless since I have no idea what genuine Italian tiramisu is supposed to taste like - only what I like - but tiramisu is my second favorite dessert so that's that) I like mine very moist and boozy and.. spongey? .. and theirs absolutely hit the spot - really delicious and sweet and intense - I'm not a chocolate lover and theirs has a layer of chocolatey goodness on top that was nice but that I imagine most people would appreciate more than I. But what I was shocked by was - after our wonderful waitress sang the praises of their straight from New York cheesecake recipe, we finally ordered some and it was *AMAZING* - the PERFECT balance between the moist cake and dry cheesiness - every one of us at the table kept returning to devour it.. (cheesecake being my favorite dessert... but, unlike tiramisu, nearly ubiquitous). This had to be one of my top three cheesecakes ever... And the portions of both desserts were sufficient for four..   So for the tl:dr folks: atmosphere so-so,  wait staff wonderful, helpful, sweet,  food (except the caesar) terrific, full of flavor,  flexibility really very generous and helpful,  dessert - amazing!  All-in-all a really fun, delicious experience that we will repeat!   and my wife realized she should really just trust me more - like, of course... (thanks Yelp! - thanks Miele's!)"}
{"text":"Had this place delivered on DoorDash. DD was great, but Miele's food was disgusting! Homemade sauce was a lie, both the red and Toscana. Full of corn starch, cold canned artichokes and olives, dessert not homemade. We just threw out the side pasta, even the kids wouldn't touch it. $55 for two entrees, a kiddie pasta and dessert. What a rip-off! Tasted like microwave dinners from the freezer. An insult to Italy."}
{"text":"The Italian dinners were very good and service friendly and responsive. The drinks were pricey and the pasta perfect. My wife and I had the same dinner, BUT we spend the night on the toliets. Not food poisoning but something in the watery artichoke, mushroom meat dish messed with my digestive system. Suggest you find out if they are serving a banquet before you go.  We will go back after the holidays and try different dishes and see how it goes."}
{"text":"Okay so let me just tell you a story. This weekend was my boyfriends birthday and he likes Italian. So I ask him \"where you wanna go?\" And we sticking around my new place cause I gotta try the locals. So he mentioned Miele's and I was like wha? Looked it up and someone said the best Italian in the valley and I was like \"whoa quite the statement.\" So we had to check it out. If you are ready for a religious experience, then you are at the right place. I have been all over Italy, tried lots of dishes. But this place is a piece of heaven. First off the waitress was a doll, classy music mix, and food that might seriously question why you've been making sauce out of a glass again. First I started with a Malbec and I paired it with the drunken bread. A beautiful plate with a light balsamic glaze graced with beautiful lightly crisped bread with cheese and prosciutto. I say can't get any better, oh but wait the next is the side salad with tomatoes just ripe, crisp romaine in perfect sizes so I'm not dribbling the amazing Italian dressing over my face. That dressing was perfect. The portions were perfectly sized. You get beautiful pasta dishes, aromatic and the flavors just perfectly peaking out. Portobello mushroom ravioli, yes queen! Let me tell you tons for I ate like the queen. They serve this beautiful fresh baked Italian bread that pairs perfectly with sauce because the dishes are saucy Enough to have plenty for the pasta and the bread cause dunking rules. Then you too it off with the limoncello cake which was so bouncy, light, fluffy, moist and beautiful symmetrical layers, you'll be confused if you are in Arizona or heaven. Or both but seriously, bless you taste palate. Come to Miele's."}
{"text":"Visited this place based on the yelp reviews. It is awesome!! We are visiting from Monterey/Santa Cruz, California, we know what shrimp should taste like and it tastes perfect. If you aren't too PC and willing to try the veal, you won't be disappointed. Highly recommend Miele's!!!"}
{"text":"I always love trying new places that I normally would not go too.   That's why I am an avid user of the wonderful APP of Groupon!!  Groupon was offering a $9 for $18 lunch deal, and I was in the mood for Italian....so why not?   Upon arriving, we were quickly greeted and allowed to sit wherever we would like. Found a nice booth in the corner. I already looked at the menu beforehand, and was set on ordering the homemade lasagna ($8+) and my wife ordered the spaghetti w/meatballs($7+). The prices were very reasonable.   We received delicious, warm homemade bread and a salad with our entrees. The entrees came out, and even though they were smaller than what you would get at lets say a Buca di Bepo, it was a comfortable size serving. The flavors were VERY authentic tasting.   Now, we couldn't leave without trying the homemade cheesecake (secret recipe from Brooklyn) and it was the most sinful cheesecake I have ever tasted. Better than Cheesecake Factory.   Throughout our dining experience, we were waited on (and always checked on) by a gentleman with the name of Rich. Excellent waiter!!! If you have the privilege of asking for him, let him know I sent you."}
{"text":"First timers. Four stars for the food, three stars for the atmosphere, two stars for the service (very slow). Complimentary bread with oil and balsamic was awesome! No charge for second basket. Minestrone was very good. The salad that comes with the entree was ok. Lasagna and calzone were very good. Regrettably we didn't have room for desserts which looked fabulous. Atmosphere was quaint but nothing fancy. Although slow, the server was very pleasant. The place had a strong scent of bad air freshener that faded after a few minutes. Will go back and try pasta dishes and desserts next time using another restaurant.com certificate. Probably best for authentic Italian carry out."}
{"text":"would not order from here again! food is okay, definitely not as good as it should be for the price. spent 15 on ravioli and only got 5 of them, took over an hour for delivery. only good thing about this place is the bread."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Every item that came out of the kitchen was delicious! How have I not heard of this place before?! Thank you groupon!"}
{"text":"After eating numerous times at your Tempe location, we visited the Mesa restaurant last week. Instead of entering to the enticing aromas of garlic & herbs, there was an overwhelming scent of a floral air freshener. I as well as many people in the Valley suffer from asthma & am very sensitive to perfumes etc. The scent permeated the entire restaurant & although the service was very good, it was difficult to taste the food with the odor of air freshener in my nose! Unfortunately, I don't think I'll return. Thanks for listening."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in an unpretentious strip mall. But it looks perfectly fine on the inside - nice bathrooms, too.   Service was consistently slow, even though the restaurant was mostly empty. Took 10 minutes just to get bread, but it *was* outstanding bread, freshly baked. The olive oil/balsamic on the table were great, too. Usually the table oil doesn't taste like olives at a lot of places -- this did.  The entrees were surprisingly reasonable - less than $15 included a side salad, which was decent, and a small bowl of spaghetti, which was delicious. The menu was really big, too. But my Chicken Zingara (kind of like a Chicken Marsala, which both of my parents ordered) was really, really disappointing, as was theirs. First, the portions were quite small, but for the price, that didn't bother me much. My issue is that my chicken (supposedly with a balsamic sauce and some veggies) literally tasted like chop suey. Like, canned chop suey. I've never been so surprised that a restaurant could mess up a chicken dinner THAT badly. So if you come here, I guess stick to the pasta. The marinara that came on my side of spaghetti was delicious."}
{"text":"New location! The new space is larger and can host banquets. We came here for dinner around 7 on a Friday night and while it was decently busy, we were able to get a table with no reservation or wait.   When I looked at the menu the first thing I noticed was how odd the pricing structure was. Instead of rounded numbers or prices that end in .99 or .98 I saw items such as Greek salad for $9.17 or chicken parmesan for $7.91. Perhaps the pricing is based on some percentage increase rather than increments in whole amounts. It wasn't a detrimental thing, but it was interesting to see such unusual looking prices for items.  The menu is quite expansive and includes chicken, seafood, pizza/calzones and pasta. We started with the drunk bread appetizer, I ordered the eggplant Parmesan dinner, and had a bite of some sausage, garlic and olive calzone.   We were first served some delicious complimentary bread. It had a light texture with a delicate crispiness around the edges. The olive oil/balsamic mixture it was served with was great. The appetizer was equally as good, with prosciutto, cheese, and a heavy dose of butter. It was touted as being doused with white wine which it very well could have been but I tasted more melted butter in the bread than anything (Which isn't a necessarily bad thing). A delicate drizzle of balsamic vinegar on the side completed the dish.  The eggplant was a sizable portion and a ton of food for your money since it also came with a side of salad (Romaine with croutons, olives, and tomatoes) and spaghetti with tomato sauce. I didn't care for the heaviness of the breading on the eggplant but it was crispy and golden. My husband on the other hand enjoyed the heavy taste of my dish a lot so to each their own!  The calzone bite I had was quite tasty. The dough was perfectly cooked with a light outer crispness and well seasoned filling.  Service was good. Our server was elegant, friendly and polite. She refilled drinks as needed and came by to check on us as needed. A manager even stopped by to say hi.  I'm not sure if it's every Friday night but this evening there was a gentleman playing some cover songs on his guitar and keyboard which I enjoyed. However, you know you are getting old when you start to hear folksy countrified versions of the rebellious music you listened to as a teen as evening dinner entertainment. Oh, hearing Green Day will never be the same!"}
{"text":"There's a lot of good to be said for this restaurant and a couple of opportunities to improve. First and foremost, we arrived around 5:00 on a Saturday evening and didn't have any wait to get a table for 5 - SCORE!! The table was comfortable and the restaurant clean, although it is showing its age in a few ways. Our server was attentive and friendly and even engaged the kiddos, which is a plus! The food was very good...very good... but it took some time to come out. We enjoyed the garlic knots that were free with our yelp check-in while we waited and then the salads came. Warning...there are olives on the salad. I'm not an olive fan so had I known, I'd have asked for mine without. But thankfully they weren't chopped fine so I could pick them out. The dressing was good and all was right with the world again. The only other opportunity was the temperature in the restaurant. It was a bit warm; maybe because we were sitting in a corner, I don't know. Overall a very good experience! A few tweaks and it could be a great one!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch one day. LOVED!!! The food was great and affordable. I see myself returning with a larger crowd!"}
{"text":"Service not good.  My two granddaughters and I ordered. They ask if we would like bread, broccoli bread did not bring plates or butter Or dipping oil. My granddaughter's food was done before mine. I ordered a margherita  pizza There was no fresh mozzarella, they had to go out after the basil, it was chopped and bruised horribly. My granddaughters were finished with their meal by the time my pizza got there. Would not recommend this place to anybody. They didn't even offer to comp me on my meal."}
{"text":"Not the greatest location and we probably would have never gone if it wasn't for their Groupon that was available. The pizza and calzones were really quite good. We also got the spaghetti and meatballs, delicious. I would recommend this place. I will say I didn't give it 5 stars cause of the slower service. Other than that a good choice."}
{"text":"Nice old-fashioned Italian sit down. It was clear that the food was all handmade you know wasn't anything out of a can or jar service was impeccable nice atmosphere comfortable and country Italian really nice and the prices are great"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Italian food in the valley. Having recently moved in Virginia, I miss this place a lot. The food is very good for a reasonable price. The portions are large and they fill you up quickly. The drunken bread was pretty good. I didn't know it was dipped in sweet wine until my wife and i fell a little buzz. The calazone is one of my favorite things on the menu. It literally has cheese falling out of it as you eat it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the new location. I have eaten Mieles' delivery several times now and I have not been disappointed. Last night I had made to order pizza, garlic cheese bread, and salad. Everything came out perfect and my kids inhaled the Pizza!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and the first couple of times it was fantastic.  The last time we went we did not get waited on for some time and the owner came over and ended up taking our order.  Apparently they had a large party in the back and it was holding up everything.  I had ordered a chicken dish with prosciutto and didn't care for it - the prosciutto was too overpowering - that being said, everything else we have had here we have enjoyed.  Also our meal was interrupted several times my a family seated next to us whose youngsters were upset about something.  Although I blame the parents and not the restaurant for this.  At any rate, fresh bread, great salads and house salad dressing is wonderful.  Really good eggplant parmesan."}
{"text":"OMG! It's so delicious and nice with good hospitality. Big portions and great prices!"}
{"text":"Great food and a great atmosphere:) the inside is completely different and looks very romantic.  The service is great! highly recommend.  The baked zitti is not heavy at all. Recommend it."}
{"text":"1st time here & it was delish!!! The fresh out of the oven bread was spot on and the pizza was perfect. We will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"Really solid Italian. I'm always surprised its not packed for lunch, got to give them a 5* because not only really good food, but their prices are on the lower end for what I expect to spend for lunch. Being friendly is a great bonus too!"}
{"text":"This was a very good experience. Although the wait for the entree was long it was well worth it. The staff was very friendly, food was very good and made us want to come back for lunch. Awesome place."}
{"text":"We just had a baby shower in their event space. We had a great experience! The food was delicious and Rich took great care of us! I would recommend Mieles for your next family gathering or event. The price could not be beat, either"}
{"text":"We went for lunch.  The choices are numerous and the prices are extremely reasonable.  Best of all----the food is GREAT (the warm bread was SO delicious) and the atmosphere (interior) is tasteful, peaceful,  clean and very welcoming.  The personnel is friendly and efficient.  GO because you will LOVE it!!!"}
{"text":"They recently moved to a bigger space (not next to the pet store anymore). Service has always been great as is the food. It's a hidden gem. The only downside before was that it smelled like it was next to a pet store. Now it smells great and can accommodate much larger parties. They even have a banquet hall. Also, they have draft beer usually including some local brews."}
{"text":"I ordered from Miele tonight, over $60, to be delivered. My expected delivery time was a little over 45 minutes. After an hour I called them to find out where my food was to be told it would be another 30 minutes.  It was late at night, my family was hungry, and I was getting upset.  40 minutes later we called again and they told us it should only be a few more minutes.  It took 1:45 minutes to get our food.  And the person who delivered it wasn't a driver, she was one of their servers.  The food was good. For what you pay for, you get a lot of food: Bread, salad, pasta, entree.  And I give that part 4/5...but the poor service and unapologetic nature of the staff dropped the rating."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and well prepared. The server, Dawn was great. She was very attentive and if we asked a question she got an answer for us immediately. Our water was always refilled before it ran out. They also have an extensive wine and spirits menu. Can't wait to go back and bring our friends."}
{"text":"So very disappointing!  The straccatelli soup was salty to the point of not being able to eat it, the chicken and veal parmesan dishes were tough and tasted like they were frozen and reheated.  The tomato sauce was very acidy and tasted like they put a ton of tomato paste in it.  My eggplant parm was tough and had long wide strips of purple eggplant skin fried up instead of inside eggplant slices.(the menu state peeled eggplant...) My husbands gnocchi dish was ordered without the peppers, which the waitress noted and then was delivered with peppers.  No offer to take it back.  My eggplant was brought to the manager to look at it, he did take it off the bill but never came to the table.  And he was out on the dining room floor. Service was slow, waitress disappeared for ten minutes at a time, no refills of the water unless you asked and the  meal took a long time to come out.  Side note: This restaurant is no longer owned by the Miele family.  They now own Almalfi's on Alma School in Chandler.  Save yourself hours of indigestion and go there - the food is great like the old Mieles was!"}
{"text":"Miele's has some of the best Italian food hands down. The fresh, baked bread before your entrée  is the absolute best. The staff and service is always great. I'm not a big fan of their new location but it won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"My grandson and I had the displeasure of ordering from this restaurant. A waste of 32.00 and I tipped the delivery person.  The crust is bland, the fetuccine was like gooey. Tasteless Italian food should be deemed a crime"}
