{"text":"The Cleveland Pickle is hands down my favorite place to grab a sandwich downtown. To start it is a very cute little place. Josh and co are some of the nicest people you could ever meet and their food is never a disappointment. I love just about everything on the menu but on indecisive days I always go with the Payne ave. Their soups are always fresh and delicious and fit with the current weather.  I can't wait to go back. I love you guys!"}
{"text":"A fun little sandwich shop with unique combinations. It's a good size sandwich for the price, but everything else has to be purchased separate. They don't have tap water, only bottled water, pop and iced teas. The staff was really friendly and offered some suggestions to us on the best sandwiches to get and the usuals."}
{"text":"I have gone to cleveland pickle religiously ever since I found out about the downtown one. I made the drive from lakewood sometimes specifically just for a sandwich. So I was excited to find out they were opening up a lakewood shop. Unfortunately ever since they opened the lakewood store the quality of their sandwiches has gone way down. This is probably the fourth time I've been to the lakewood store and each time it is no where near as good as it used to be. The pressed sandwiches don't even get warm, so you're left with unmelted cheese and a lukewarm sandwich. They seem rushed making the sandwiches and don't take the time to make them as good as they used to. Don't know if I'll go back anymore...."}
{"text":"Go support this awesome local sandwich shop!!!!!!!!! Cleveland Pickle set up shop in the City Club building just as I was leaving my office job there, so unfortunately I had to deal with Arabica six floors down for lunch instead of the Pickle, but regardless... Josh Kabat rocked at Reddstone, and is awesome once again at Cleve Pickle!"}
{"text":"Have not been to Lakewood location, but assuming  it's anything like the original spot on Euclid/E.9th, Cleveland pickle is one of the better sandwich places in the city.   Menu and service are excellent. Been there a handful of times and the food has been phenomenal every time.   Highly recommend checking out if you've never been. Local gem"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches. Found out there that Josh trained under Michael Simon and it shows. Out of this world, creative, unforgettable. The couple that runs out are wonderful, friendly, and accommodating. Thanks so much for a great lunch! My idea: go to the rock n roll hall of fame and work up an appetite on the short walk to Cleveland Pickle afterwards! Perfect downtown Cleveland day, and they could use your company on a Saturday. Go!"}
{"text":"Decent deli sandwich option.  I'll cop to not being a huge fan of sandwiches so I'd probably rather eat in a burger place, but I like to support local businesses and once in a while a sandwich is OK.  On the plus side, it has good veggie sandwich options, tasty pickles, and the staff are friendly.  On the minus side, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the bread, which seemed closer to something you'd get at the grocery store or a Subway than a nice big fresh roll.  I am also not sure why a cold sandwich would be served to me half squashed flat - it's not like they had to put it through a panini press.    Also if you're eating in,  the big round tables with stools are kind of uncomfortable to sit at.  There are only two booths which always seem to be the first place people sit.  You'd think they'd take the hint and put in a bunch more booths.    Finding a place to park to go in and eat and/ or pick up your order can be tough, but that's true of many Lakewood food joints so I did not take off for that.    I would go again but am still wishing for better quality bread since the sandwiches are on the expensive side."}
{"text":"The Cleveland Pickle is a downtown CLE staple. Carefree, casual and quick, it's a fun place to grab food and head out during the warmer months. I have stopped in for lunch a few times during my work day, and haven't been disappointed by the big tastes and big portions they offer. I typically save half of my sandwich for the next day; their sandwiches are huge and loaded with ingredients. This makes up for the average sandwich cost of $8-10, making it into two $4-5 lunches for those without a gigantic appetite."}
{"text":"If your a fan of sandwiches, this place is for you. This is easily one of the best sandwich shops in northeast Ohio.   I don't have anything against Jimmy Johns or Potbellys. They are great for what they are. But if your downtown for lunch Mon - Sat, do yourself a favor and eat here. It may cost you $2-3 more for the meal but you get about $6 more food and $100 more flavor.  This place is right on par with Melt and Bogtrodders. A hidden gem that should be an institution in the near future."}
{"text":"The menu at Cleveland Pickle was very unique despite having mainly sandwiches, soups and salads.    The atmosphere felt mostly DIY and home-grown, with its use of chalkboard paint and homemade brownies, but it also had the feel of being established and professional.  I was able to interact with the owner, who initially came off as being a little bit impatient, but redeemed himself by striking up a conversation with us once we decided to stay and eat.  I ordered a Brazen River, which included spicy chipotle chicken salad (a first!), lettuce, and tomato on a plump hoagie roll.  The bread was clearly freshly made and just the right texture.  It really made the sandwich, which was good already!  My husband ordered a salad with a chicken salad patty in it.  The salad used dark greens, which I prefer, and was an appropriate size for a meal.  My husband said that the patty was delicious.  Both meals came with a (shocker here) small container of sliced pickles.  The pickles had a highly original flavor, unlike any other that I've tried.  It was a mixture of subtly sweet, subtly sour, and subtly spicy with maybe a hint of garlic. It was difficult to pinpoint the exact flavor that I was experiencing.  I'm still not sure if I like it or not, but I'm sure that some people would love it.  For dessert, we split a homemade peppermint patty brownie.  Holy crap, was that delicious.  It had just the right crunch:goo ratio with enough mini peppermint patties to bite into one in every bite.  Overall, I would say that this a great place to stop in for lunch on the way to the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, on the way to an Indians game, or even during your lunch break.  It certainly has the capacity to cater to a wide variety of consumers.  My only hesitations for going to Cleveland Pickle would be if you have friends with dietary restrictions (there are options, but not a ton) or are looking for a large meal. However, if you are looking for a quick, casual option, Cleveland Pickle is the way to go."}
{"text":"The \"west sider\" sandwich is the BOMB!  Great spot; the girl working the cash register is super hot, and the sandwich chef is a true culinary artist."}
{"text":"Wow was this place terrible!! How Cleveland Pickle is in business is beyond me. First, the food is awful. The bread was doughy and tough. The meat was slimy and the toppings made up an excessive portion of the sandwich.   Worse than the food was the customer service. I opted for delivery only to find out that if I want the food delivered, I have to call the delivery company and provide my address. Why they couldn't have done that is unclear to me. The delivery service got our food caught in his bike spokes and had to return to Cleveland pickle to have them remake the subs.   When the delivery service showed up, he explained what happened. No issue whatsoever until we open up the food and our sandwiches are incorrect. I called CP to make them aware and the employee that answered explained that because she didn't have a food ticket, she had to go off memory of what we ordered. Obviously, she was wrong and places me on hold to \"she what she could do for me.\" When she got back to me, she told me she could give me a $1 coupon or I could call the owner myself because \"he may be able to do more for me. \"   Do yourself a favor and eat anywhere other than Cleveland Pickle."}
{"text":"My stomach is still reeling from a Westsider I got this afternoon. I had one there about 6 weeks ago and it was delicious. The bread was nicely grilled and the taste had me thinking about it and craving it. I finally made it back to Lakewood to get another one and was totally disappointed. The bread wasn't toasted and the entire thing was soggy and goopy. Not to mention the indigestion. Ugh! Won't be craving that again."}
{"text":"First visit a few weeks ago... previous posters got it right.  Great sandwiches at a slightly-higher price point, but the quality makes it a deal!  I had the \"Classic Pickle\" sandwich, which is similar to a spicy Italian... Capicola, Prosciutto, etc and a Balsamic/ Oil mix.  Awesome!  Only losing a star in my mind due to their limited hours... would love it if they were open til 6:00 PM to catch some take-home grub.    That said, I did notice that they occasionally have extended hours on Tribe game evenings.  Recommend calling them, maybe they'll be there.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Downtowner. It was a good sandwich but it was certainly not the best $9 sandwich I've ever had. However, my girlfriend really liked her sandwich and as a huge fan of my city I enjoy the giant pickle climbing on the Terminal Tower that they have inside."}
{"text":"Chicken paprikash soup was amazing; my husband had the Lake Effect and I had the terminal - both were delicious. The brie/apricot jam combo is delightful.  The service was excellent - the owner was working up front and we enjoyed chatting with him.  Great lunch spot for the downtown crowd."}
{"text":"Yum!!!  Great vegetarian options here.  I got the Downtowner and it was delish and very filling!"}
{"text":"Holy wow! First time visiting Cleveland Pickle. I got the burnin' river. Delicious!! Love local places like this. Will definitely come back next time I visit the CLE!"}
{"text":"These are some tasty sandwiches.  I had the Classic Pickle and it was the perfect mix of tasty meat and cheese accented with some onions and a balsamic reduction. Their bread is about perfect as well.  Nice people, nice food.  Eat here."}
{"text":"Two words:  Shoreway Salad.   If you're into goat cheese, this is for you.  A simple roman lettuce salad, tomatoes, pine nuts and \"porky bits\" which are basically bacon bits, really really delicious bacon bits.  comes with vinegarette dressing which compliments it well.  they also throw a pickle of the day which is always good.  I can't speak to anything else because this is all I get when I come here!"}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and helpful, but these sandwiches cannot be eaten on the road. I ordered several vegetarian options and found the sandwiches impossible to eat on the go. I'm sure they're fine at a table, but behind the wheel they're a sloppy disaster. The pasta salad is nice as are the deviled eggs. Overall, 3 stars dine-in. 2 as take away."}
{"text":"Spent a few weeks in Cleveland on business and stopped by Cleveland Pickle multiple times. The sandwiches are DELICIOUS (try the city club) and the owners are very sweet. Would absolutely recommend to friends in/visiting the city."}
{"text":"Today was my first experience with Cleveland Pickle. I ordered a side of pasta salad and the Blazin River. Contrary to what other yelpers say, I enjoyed the pasta salad (perhaps they've changed their recipe). It was slathered in dressing and yummy. I was taken back by how comically small the portion was, however it was only $1.50. If you are hankering for a big portion of pasta salad I would order several servings of it.   The Blazin River was good, however I probably wouldn't order it again. The chipotle sauce didn't quite do it for me. I was hoping for more of a tangy sauce since the menu stated that lime was an ingredient.  I felt the lime got lost a bit especially when competing with the overall spicy level. The size of the sandwich is large, so you do get a lot for your money.  I'll definitely be back to sample more from their menu."}
{"text":"sandwich was good,  condiments? yeah its got a lot of it on there. pickles good but lacked punch."}
{"text":"First of all: Yes, this place is open, though their Website and Facebook page don't yet make that clear.   I had been looking forward to eating here.  As other reviewers have said, the sandwiches are creative, and the one I had today (The Downtowner, minus cheese) was quite tasty. I really dig that the Pickle has different sauces and, of course, pickles, to infuse a lot of flavor into the sandwiches.   That said, I agree that the price point may be a little high for everyday. (My sandwich, which came with a small side dish of house pickle chips, was $9.) However, it seems they make pretty much everything from sauces to pickles in-house, so you're really paying for time and quality ingredients, which come though in flavor profiles. And, the sandwiches are pretty damn big.   Service was really excellent; owners are very friendly. One downside: I asked if removing the cheese from my sandwich would make it vegan, and they weren't sure about the bread. That said, my asking spurred them to ask the vendor, so presumably they'll know soon.  Tip: Until the menu is posted on their site, see it on their Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=164465197005032&set=t.100003246585259&type=3&theater  UPDATED 4/15 after a second trip."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches but for a place with \"pickle\" in its name the pickles left a lot to be desired(They were not pickled long enough and lacked flavor. Plus they're cut in small little pieces. Why not spears or at least circles not quarter circles.). The staff could not have cared less about the customers that came in when I was there. The sandwiches are quite big. Better to split one and share a bag of chips."}
{"text":"Asked for a sandwich for my 3 year old who was next to me.   Asked specifically for salami and yellow mustard. They gave a 3 year old spicy mustard. Very disappointed.  Whether the counter or the kitchen there is no excuse."}
{"text":"Back in Cleveland means - back to the \"PICKLE\"...:-) They EVEN DELIVERED it to me this time - to the Burke Lakefront Airport. This place is a must when Im in town!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my house, so I just had to try it. Yesterday my boyfriend and I ordered the Classic to split. It cost $10, but was big enough for 2. The friendly girl at the counter gave us each a little dish of pickles, which were quite tasty. The sandwich itself was pretty good. Not the best I have ever had, but it was still yummy.   Maybe I'll go back? Maybe not?"}
{"text":"5 stars for the sandwich- I had the classic pickle and it was damn good.  Nice bread choice good meat and the balsamic reduction mixed with the angry pickle spread was great.  get this sandwich  I also tried the pasta salad which was meh-  really creamy as advertised but it seemed just like miracle whip and noodles-  it need something else maybe some smoked paprika on top or cucumbers tossed in the mix but something   I also did the sweet and spicy small pickle because for a dollar you almost have to- these were totally worth the dollar.  They were pretty good but no awesome-  artisanal pickles seem to be a thing now and some are amazing they like pop in your mouth these were not those but still a very good pickle  Skip- jimmy johns walk two more blocks to this place-  to take it even easier order online."}
{"text":"ok so I had to wait a little longer than the average would for a sandwich but I was ordering for a larger group to take back to the office. Sandwich was certainly better than i had expected. They really did the place up and the decor was cool. I am going to have to try their peanut butter banana sandwich a try next time! I had the classic pickle it was good but I wish I would have been more risky and went for some of their other neat menu items!"}
{"text":"However this place has any reviews with more than one star is beyond anything I can understand. First, the service. I ordered online and when I came in to pick up my order I went to what appeared to be a pick-up counter as it was an open counter by the door and was promptly ignored. At first I thought it was just busy, but the man making sandwiches came to the counter and purposely looked away from me while he bagged sandwiches before returning to the prep area. I had to get in line and wait as if I hadn't ordered just to get anyone's attention. Now before I get to the food, I have to say I cannot emphasize enough of this place is called \"Cleveland Pickle\", I ordered a sandwich called \"Classic Pickle\", and on the menu it distinctly uses the word \"pickle.\" In most situations, the fact that they forgot the pickles wouldn't have been anything more than a slight disappointment or mild annoyance. I didn't realize it until I got back to work, so I emailed them in hope that I might get an extra pickle on a return visit. Instead of saying anything helpful, they told me the Classic Pickle at Cleveland Pickle with the word \"pickle\" in its description has no pickles and to me, and I'm quoting directly from their email, \"maybe read the menu first!\" Considering my meal came to just under $12 (a sandwich and a terrible pasta salad) I would've thought I'd be met with more than mediocre food and blatant rudeness, but that appears to be par for the course here."}
{"text":"this joint is baller yo. subs be tasty like you neva seen. she asked if i want some pickles and i asked her if the sky's blue. no regrets fam. peace"}
{"text":"I've only been once but I loved my sandwich. I got the classic pickle and asked for the garlic spread to be added on as well as the balsamic reduction. The sauces really make the sandwich delicious as well as the bread. I loved it even though it was really messy. The chips are really good too, I got salt and vinegar and put them on my sandwich."}
{"text":"I got the Clevelander. It was delicious! I called ahead because I wanted to know what the \"cleveland pickle chips\" were, and they are house made pickle chips. They were perfect on the sandwich. My only complaint is that they put a ton of sauce on this sandwich, so it drips everywhere, but the sauce itself is great.   Fast, friendly, and good food!"}
{"text":"Excellent sub style sandwich.  A little more $ than subway, but worth it. The owner personally greeted us and explained the different sandwiches.  Really tasty...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Solid new lunch spot with some very tasty sandwiches. I have tried several items, but i think my favorite so far is the East Sider, I really appreciate the use of balsamic with the beefsteak tomatoes and the pancetta.  They have been getting very busy which is great to see, and they are doing an outstanding job getting the sandwiches out in a timely manner, so if you see a big line do not be deterred.  Do not go in expecting the pickles to be the showcase, its simply a side item and there is very limited seating so takeout is preferred.  Someone complained the sandwiches were a little pricey, my take is that its worth the extra $2 versus Jimmy Johns, Subway, or Quiznzos so splurge a little and enjoy. Happy to say the Cleveland Pickle is now part of my weekly lunch schedule. Please support local restaurants over chains!"}
{"text":"Love this place in between classes at CSU. Far better than any other sandwhich around campus. BUT if Josh and Kiaran are my working your sandwhich will be far more tasty. Otherwise the other worker don't have consistency. Still love it, but train your associates on consistency"}
{"text":"The wait is never long, each sandwich is delicious, and all for the right price. I'm not a huge pickle fan, but these are some quality pickles. I recommend the West-Sider.  The giant pickle dude is actually pretty terrifying, and his eyes follow you through the store. His gloved hands and pristine white shoes only conceal his motives. The scale and size are depicted in different manners and I am unsure of his true form.  Both the sandwich and the anthropomorphic pickle haunt me. One is tasty, the other will forever lurk in the dark shadows of my mind."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, great location for those in the Gateway area, and good prices for what you get. These sandwiches will fill you up and are well-prepared."}
{"text":"Should rename it Amateur Sandwiches. Food was average, prices too high, service was nonexistent. I heard it's closed now anyway. Big surprise. Pay your rent, deadbeats."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Cleveland, staying at the schofield and wanted to grab something to-go quick and just take it back to my hotel since I hate eating alone. So I searched yelped and this place had great ratings and was just around the corner.  The guys working inside were incredibly friendly. Great service and very quick.  I ordered the west sider and o.m.g y.u.m. Such a great sandwich. Why are sandwiches not made by yourself 100x better??? Eat here!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches. Awkward and unfriendly service at the counter. I have wanted to go back, but have avoided it for that reason. There are tons of good sandwiches and pickles in the area, and a few places stand out as having very friendly people working there. This isn't one of them."}
{"text":"I just adore this place.   I am so happy that they opened the second location in Lakewood (near where I live and work) because it is very rare that I am downtown and when I am it is for a planned dinner or event.   I've never had a sandwich I didn't like. My favorites by far are the East Sider and West Sider.  *Note: If you want a sandwich pressed that isn't you can ask and they will press it for you."}
{"text":"Jeez Louise! What great sandwiches...just what I hope for in a little hole in the wall sandwich shop. \"Discovered\" this place when I was opening \"The 9\" hotel and we were working out of a little office just up the street. Didn't find time to go back for a while once the hotel actually opened, but love it always..."}
{"text":"Need to stop in. delicious sandwiches and friendly owners!! Can't wait to visit Cleveland to visit the Cleveland Pickle!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving, someone could mistake the menu as being limited at first blush, but then you realize the Pickle has something for everyone, and it is delicious. The staff is friendly, efficient, and fast in their preparations, and the quality and taste is so much better than other sandwich shops nearby... Or elsewhere, actually. Cleveland Pickle is a must visit when you visit (but don't expect to stay in and dine at lunch time - seating is limited. But why would you want to stay inside when there are so many things to so in the city?!)"}
{"text":"These sandwiches are tasty, but messy and they sure do stick with you for the rest of the day. The smell will follow you and it'll probably be a bit of a challenge to get the oil/sauce off of your hands. That said, I do really enjoy the sandwiches, it's just not my first choice.   I had the east sider once and didn't get my side of pickles--disappointing since the sandwich doesn't actually have pickles on it, so I was banking on getting those on the side. I got the downtowner another time, which was unique and delicious, but a little overdone for me. The flavors were all things that I liked, but the sandwich itself was really overwhelming. Also, I've never really been impressed with the pickle aspect of the place, which is unfortunate, as that's really what drew me in as a pickle fiend. They're nothing amazing and often just get lost in the sandwich. The classic pickle was probably the best of the three that I tried, but I found nothing particularly pickley or special about it.   The biggest perk of this place is the staff! Everyone is wonderful and pleasant, so that's a refreshing change from people at, say, Jimmy Johns, ahem (they always look bored out of their minds and pissed at JJ's)."}
{"text":"I ordered some sandwiches from The Cleveland Pickle for some associates and I at work. The food was good, but beware: ordering pickup from downtown is a bad idea! There is no parking anywhere and the location is in the middle of a bunch of construction. I drove around for 15 minutes to find parking, willing to walk a half mile to pick up my sammies, but still no luck! I ended up parking in an alley, throwing the hazards on, and sprinting to pick up my food!  Now on to the actual food... I ordered the Downtowner - a vegetarian sandwich with pine nuts, goat cheese, spinach, roasted tomato pesto, and a balsamic apricot spread. the sandwich was very tasty - I loved the roasted tomato pesto and goat cheese combo. I am not a vegetarian, but this sandwich looked delicious - so i gave it a shot. I wasn't disappointed with the taste, but it wasn't as filling as I expected - so next time I may go with one of the carnivorous options. My co-workers went with the Terminal and the Blazin River - both of which they said were very good. Each sandwich is served with a side of pickle chips, which I thought were a little bland and over hyped. Kinda pricey for just a sandwich ($8-10), but its not ridiculous and they use quality ingredients.   This place has a creative sandwich menu that leaves you wanting to come back to try something new. I would recommend the Cleveland Pickle, but advise checking it out if you are already downtown because parking is near impossible. They do deliver in the general DT vicinity (I think w9-e9). The staff also advised they have a Lakewood location with plenty of parking."}
{"text":"The tables are clean and have fresh flowers, the staff is friendly and happy to answer questions, and the selections I tried were big enough for two meals (and absolutely amazing).  My favorite so far is the Payne Avenue Panini: pork meatballs with a spicy adobo sauce topped with crunchy carrot slaw and fresh cilantro hit with a little lime juice.  A little sweet, a little spicy.  All five of my experiences were positive, so I give it the highest rating possible and will continue to be a Cleveland Pickle fan.  Additionally, I appreciate the Sprecher soda option and am willing to wait an extra 5 minutes for a better quality sandwich than the surrounding competitors since lunch is my main meal of the day.  Totally worth a trip (and some more trips after that)."}
{"text":"I decided to give Cleveland Pickle another try after a bad experience 7 months ago, but my experience this time was so awful that I am definitely never going back again (despite living a block away).  My complaints are basically the same as last time.  First, they got my order wrong again -- twice in the same visit.  This time, I ordered the Terminal sandwich, but vegetarian and not pressed (i.e. cold).  The first sandwich that I got was pressed, so I asked them to remake it and the next sandwich that I got had meat on it.  After the second botched sandwich, I got a refund and left without having lunch.  Second, they were rude beyond belief about fixing their errors.  When I realized that they had gotten my order wrong the first time, they responded by asking me what I wanted to do about it (instead of saying sorry and offering to remake the order as you might expect).  When I asked them to remake the sandwich, they acted incensed that I wouldn't eat the sandwich that had already made (just because it was pressed instead of cold).  I actually had to explain that I don't like warm sandwiches and that I just wanted what I had ordered. I was visibly frustrated at that point, so I apologized for being so frustrated and explained that I had had a few bad experiences at the Cleveland Pickle in the past. They asked me what had happened and when I described my last experience, they responded \"oh, you're not going to post another review on Yelp, are you?\"  I would have understood if they recognized me from my review and asked that I give them a better review next time, but their comment was not said lightheartedly and sounded like a bit of a threat coming from the guy that was making the sandwiches.  I've worked in the food service industry, so I find this kind of behavior to be absolutely unacceptable. People make mistakes, but customer service has to come first and there is no excuse for being that rude to anyone. I think that it was completely inappropriate for them to call me out for writing an honest, albeit negative review on Yelp (especially when I offered them an opportunity to fix their mistake before writing my first review). Also, they have literally gotten my order wrong 4 out of the 5 times that I've been there.  With that level of error, they clearly need a better system for communicating orders between the register and those making the sandwiches.  It's such a shame, because I love to support local businesses and this would be a nice place to grab lunch if they improved their customer service and consistently made sandwiches as ordered."}
{"text":"I've never been much of a sandwich person but I will say that Cleveland Pickle has some pretty tasty options.  With a bit of a small menu you cant go wrong with any of the choices but I would recommend one of their hot pressed sandwiches.   My favorite cold sandwich is the blazin river, their spicy chicken salad. If you're looking for a decent sandwich in a friendly local establishment look no further. Their pickle and chips are top notch as well."}
{"text":"Second visit update. Lunchtime weekday visit. Poorly executed and not the same textures as before. Must have been rushed...."}
{"text":"I went to the Cleveland Pickle in Lakewood over the weekend. They are still fairly new so I am sure they are still working out the kinks. The wife and her husband were very nice and informative. (I think they were the owners). They have a large variety of sandwiches as well as vegan options. Also a large variety of drinks.the sandwiches were great and very large portions. I was able to have the rest of mine for lunch the next day. I got the downtowner which is a vegan sandwich and it amazing. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"So I had high expectations going to this place, and was unfortunately let down. I think the classic sandwich would have been much better without all the sauce, which completely covered the actual taste of the sandwich. If I go back, I will order with sauces on the side, then I think it will be very good."}
{"text":"I tried this place for a weekday sandwich.  I thought it was a bit odd that I was in on a Thursday at 12:00 and I was the only customer,  I ordered the pressed \"Classic\" which is capicola, genoa salami, prosciutto, provolone, angry pickle, oil, balsamic redux, lettuce, tomato and onion.  I also ordered a side of an angry pickle.  The tab was $11 ($10 sandwich and $1 pickle).  Upon looking in the bag the first thing I noticed was the angry pickle side - the pickle was sliced in chunks and placed in a solo cup - probably 4 oz. size.  It amopunted to 5 chunks.  What the heck - I paid $1 for what amounted to 5 small chunks.  It wasn't a whole deli pickle.  It amounted to probably a fourth of a full size pickle.  What the heck - for a $1 I expected a full size pickle.  On to the sandwich.  It was good however the meats did not shine out on the sandwich.  I'm guessing this is the caliber of the quality of the meat they use.  I really did not taste an angry pickle on the sandwich either.  Overall it was an ok sandwich but clearly not worth $10.  The angry pickle I had was rather tasteless.  I have had their pickles at Crockers' Farmers' Mkt. this year and have had the same impression.  Both my wife and myself have been unimpressed with their pickles.  The same held true with the sandwich.  You could do much better elsewhere for less money.  I would not recommend this place to anyone and it's doubtful if I will ever return."}
{"text":"It really pains me to pen this review as I am a huge proponent of Local businesses.  I did not find anything special about the sandwich I got at CP.  I opted for the Clevelander priced at $10.  The sandwich itself was huge so score on value for that alone.  The quality of the ingredients was sorely disappointing.  The bread was a standard sub bun.  Shredded lettuce.  Heavily slathered with garlic mayo.  And cold cut meats. I saw the guy use a stacked pre-pack of meat wrapped in paper and slap it on the bun. Really?  That quality of meat for that price?  No different options for bread?  I was expecting anything but a step-above Subway.   Where are the higher quality meats like rotisserie style or in-house cured or roasted meats?  Brioche buns or rosemary foccacia or some flavored bread?  Catch my drift?  Know who does nail this concept?  La Bodega in Tremont.  But for $10 I thought the sandwiches at Cleveland Pickle would be more creative and higher quality.  No pun intended but for the price I  thought this place would find a way to sandwich itself between a chain sub place and Bogtrotter's Doorstep but no such luck :("}
{"text":"You have not eaten a good sandwich until you have eaten at The Cleveland Pickle! hands down, the BEST Sandwiches in town! My favorite is the west sider! Though what I hear, all of their sandwiches are delicious! While it will set you back about 9 bucks! It's WELL WORTH It! Their pickles are homemade and DELICIOUS as well! The couple working the counter were the owners and you can tell they take great pride in the food they create! They are very accommodating to special requests and service with a smile and just really two of the nicest people I've ever met! If you really want to treat yourself, treat yourself to a great lunch at the Cleveland Pickle! I guarantee you will not walk away disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came here not expecting a lot, but left so happy with my decision.  Parking can be difficult to find since it's around downtown Cleveland.  The food is fresh and has good combination of meats, herbs, and sauces.  Also, the pickles they provide are good...this coming from a guy that's not a huge fan of pickles.  Simply put, this hole in the wall sandwich shop is SIMPLY DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"OK OK, I know, I know another pickle-centric restaurant. AND YES, a pickle climbing the city's most notorious tower is cliche, you've seen it once, you've seen it a thousand times. BUT these guys were a little different. These guys have a crunch in their step. I was honestly really impressed with the the perfectly put together sandwich. Just the right amount of all ingredients (meats, cheeses, and sauces. JUST IN CASE YOU'VE BEEN LIVING UNDER A PICKLE ALL THESE YEARS AND DON\"T KNOW WHAT THE INGREDIENTS TO A SANDWICH IS).   And even though I'm allergic to pickles in those little black cups, this place was Vlasic, I mean classic**.   It gives Dave's a run for their money. yep."}
{"text":"I'm not 100% sold on this place but do enjoy it enough that I'll probably give it another chance.  My choices were limited to the vegetarian options and I got the downtowner. I remember thinking that the toppings sounded weird together.. goat cheese, apricot jam and pickles in one sandwich?  And honestly, they were a little weird!  Not gross or anything but I really think it sounded better in theory than it actually was.  It was just okay.  I can tell the ingredients are of good quality but it just didn't come together for me. I'm interested in trying some of the other vegetarian sandwiches but I'm not in a rush to go back just yet.  I've heard great things so some of the other ones must be awesome!   The space is nice and staff was friendly so it's a good business overall.  I'd like to buy some of their pickles to take home next time, too!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile I ordered a salad, it was so good it was the star of the meal. There was bacon bits or something like that it was just almost burnt, made a great crouton. We shared half a sandwich, it was Eastsider I think, the one kinda like a BLT. It wasn't good to me Bc the amount of sauce, so overwhelming. It's so gross to only taste sauce, if I wanted extra extra sauce I'd order it that way. It even filled the foil I got the sandwich in. Also no pickles...not on the sandwich not on the side. Disappointing. We each got a brownie. The size was good but, blah, no taste at all, for $2 especially. I can make better brownies from a box."}
{"text":"First time to this newer Lakewood sandwich shop. Ordered takeout and the staff was very friendly. Straight forward menu. Sandwiches were satisfying. My only gripe would be the price point. My 2 sandwiches came to $20. A little high but not terrible. I'd recommend you give it a try. Support local business."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were good but we would not go back. We ordered the classic pickle and the westsider. We enjoyed both our sandwiches but it was amazing just okay. The classic pickle was $10 and the westsider was $9. We also ordered a small tomato parmesan soup which was okay. We only finished half of it. Overall we did not hate our experience at the Cleveland pickle but we would not go back."}
{"text":"Was excited for a great sandwich and I had heard good things.  The pickles were good and so were the deviled eggs, nice touch, but the chicken salad sandwich was just overpoweringly bad.  After leaving I drove directly to TJ's for another sandwich.  Maybe their other stuff is better but I was not that impressed."}
{"text":"Cleveland Pickle is closed.  . I've noticed for awhile they had a sign saying Happy New Year, but currently closed.  Today I walked by and this was posted."}
{"text":"I parked on the street and paid the meter which had a few minutes remaining from someone previous. I had a sub the Clevelander. I eat the whole Clevelander. I enjoy the logo design of a giant pickle climbing the terminal tower. What do we really have to say for ourselves when we can buy giant hoagies and navigate astounding heights ? I am enjoying Cleveland in the summer, drones, plane safety, and pickles."}
{"text":"I had the classic. It is a hit sandwich and was very good. Fresh bread and good meat. My son had the Clevelander. He didn't care for the shredded lettuce which may have been damp causing the mayo to run out of the sandwich making it messy. The seating area can accommodate several seating arrangement options including sitting in a comfy corner booth in the light of the window. Fun soda selections as well. I had a ginger brew that was great."}
{"text":"I've visited here because it was highly reviewed. and it was almost about to close. no other customer was here.I order the Clevelander sandwich which was $10.I think I really enjoyed the stuffing,I liked the bread also but is it worth the price? that's a question Probably five stars if it was seven dollars"}
{"text":"Cool little sub place. My sub was very good and I plan to go back very soon! High quality meats and homemade pickles are great."}
{"text":"Love this place and the sandwiches are incredible.  Westsider is my go to, but all the choices are great. They have also have a location at Progressive Field and a must have during a Indians game."}
{"text":"UH-MAZE-ING!!!!! Did I ever tell  you how much i like pickles?? I purchased the sweet and spicy pickles in a jar to take home and to be honest that first jar didnt make it home. They were gone before i left work that day.  Very fresh ingredients and great flavors. This place has very unique options, there is nothing like it Downtown Cleveland. Get a few extra napkins :)"}
{"text":"Cleveland Pickle, what can I say. From the hilarious guy up front giving literally every customer a nickname to the huge pickle on the wall to the absolutely delicious sandwiches being crafted, everything about this hole in a wall is awesome. The bread is perfect to hold up the copious amounts of meat and vegetables in the sandwich. The only gripe I have is that it closes so early."}
{"text":"Sandwiches like no other place in town. Unique, quality sandwiches made by friendly folks. Even if you don't like pickles, they are on the side, give em a try."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've tried almost all the sandwiches now between me and the bf going here for lunches. It's hard to pick but I would say my favorites are the downtowner and the terminal. But...I may change my mind. This is the cutest little place and the staff is so nice and friendly and fast. And I love pickles so the side of pickles with every sandwich is a big plus."}
{"text":"Good, but not what I expected. I ordered a Ranger for my mom and a West-sider for myself to go. The Ranger had horseradish slathered all over it instead of Dijon mustard. Or if that was the Dijon mustard, whooooheeee, hot. I scraped some off and the bite I tried was tasty. But the red wine reduction barely existed more than a little bit of a splash. My West-sider had creamy slaw on it instead of plain lettuce. I hate mayo, so part of why I ordered this sandwich was the lack of mayo in the description. The garlic spread wasn't very garlicky and the pickle in the middle was absent. On a positive note, the chicken paprikash soup and the little bowls of pickles on the side were delicious. It wasn't bad, but I would have enjoyed it more had my sandwiches matched the descriptions on the Lakewood online menu. I'd give this place one more chance before dismissing it. Staff was very nice. But for $25 for two sandwiches and a 16 oz soup, I want to be wowed."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Every single time I go in there the slave driver owners are being jerks to their employees. The subs are all sub par. Someone downtown talked me reluctantly to go to this place for lunch because it's close to our office. The owners are very dirty. Eating food in plain sight and touching customers food with their bare hands. Then they aren't very friendly when giving you your order. The owner even gave me a dirty look when I asked for one extra napkin. She told the worker not to ever give out more than one with each sandwich. My last straw was a roach running though the kitchen in plain sight in the day time. Done! Never again!!"}
{"text":"Kudos to my yelp friends again. Looking for a quick place to have lunch and happened to be right by this place. Had the salad with chicken cake. Have to say it is one of those dishes where everything makes sense. And it was big! The chicken cake was creamy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I especially enjoyed the sesame dressing and he even gave me a sample of the tomato vinaigrette. Very tasty as well. Tomato parm soup was kinda bland so 4 stars instead of 5. My colleagues loved her salad with the chicken salad and angry pickle too."}
{"text":"So glad they were open during the snow storm yesterday. Happy that they were so well liked on here. Really enjoyed the sandwiches we had here. A friendly couple runs the shop, and they work well together. We had the east-sider and the payne avenue panini Great combinations and so delicious."}
{"text":"I am not a huge sandwich fan, but I when I do have a sandwich....fresh bread and fresh ingredients are a must!   This place delivered on both.  Based on the Yelp reviews, I've been wanting to try Cleveland Pickle for some time....I was not disappointed.   I had the Blazin' River Sandwich, which included spicy, housemade chicken salad made with chipotle and adobo, mexican cheese, spicy house relish and lime, all on a fresh, soft sandwich roll which was at least 10\" long.  The sandwich was huge and believe it or not I could taste each and every component of the sandwich including the lime.   The prices are a little more than other \"sub\" shops that I passed on my way, but I definitely got my money's worth here.   I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches!! I've had the east sider and the west sider, both rock. The bread is so good. The employees are also very nice."}
{"text":"Excellente! Stopped in today for my first sandwich, and I will be back without a doubt. I got the Downtowner (goat cheese, pine nuts, spinach, pesto, & Apricot spread!) and it was amazing. Just a plain (very) good vegetarian sandwich.   Next on my list to dominate: The Terminal (minus ham).  Although the sandwich was great, he thing that stood out to me most was the service. The girl at the counter was fast, accurate, nice and could handle a line & phone calls. That's rare!   Oh, and oddly, I didn't really care for the pickles that came with the sandwich... too spicy for me. I am more of a garlic pickle person. But i can't wait to try their Pickle Chips!"}
{"text":"Great value for the money and the food is on point. Not too overpowering with the pickles but the flavor is there and tastes great. Will be back when passing through again!"}
{"text":"I work about a block from this place so after reading all the rave reviews I figured I would give it a try. So I finally made it over there, I am always a sucker for a great italian sandwich so I opted for the classic cleveland pickle. I must say it did not disappoint . The balsamic redux was an excellent addition to this classic sub. I will admit I wasnt a big fan of the pickles, I dont typically like sweet pickles so theirs was a little more sweet than I would prefer. I went after the lunch rush so I was able to get in and out quickly with out much fanfare. Another note, this sandwich is HUGE so bring your appetite or someone to share it with."}
{"text":"This place had great service, quick, and the sandwich was complex and had character. Would definitely return for another lunch. GREAT PICKLES."}
{"text":"I've went here two times and I may give it another try if possibly I believe it deserves it. I've got the tuna salad there, it was okay, nothing special, but nothing terrible, and then the 2nd time I got the west-sider nothing special really. It's basically a poor man's Jimmy John's without the Wheat/Lettuce wrap options. What sandwich shop doesn't have a wheat option for their customers? I don't get it, it's 2014."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop find. Excellent sandwiches made to order. Definitely not a chain restaurant and I almost walked right past it. Single door entrance, so keep your eyes open. Definitely worth a stop in if you are nearby and it will be a place I return to when I'm back in town. Friendly service too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Tasting Bread  Slightly Pricey  Blazin River is my go to  Not a place that I will seek out  Pickles aka the namesake are not great  Would love them to step up their game a bit"}
{"text":"Nice downtown sandwich shop. I got the Clevelander and it was very good. However, each sandwich comes with a small portion cup of pickle slices, and mine weren't too good. I don't think they pickled them long enough, they tasted like cucumbers. Note: The sandwich was $10 and a Snapple was $2.50, so after taxes I paid over $13, which may be expensive for some, and not for others, just throwing that out there. OH! Also, there is no bathroom. So all in all, if you are just stopping in to grab a sandwich and go back to the office then you should be fine."}
{"text":"In Cleveland on business. Returned back to my hotel for a late lunch and Yelped \"delivery food.\" Cleveland Pickle was one of the first options. Checked out the menu and figured I'd give it a shot. SOOOOOOOOOO HAPPY THAT I DID!!!! Guy on the phone was super pleasant and helpful. Ordered a Classic Pickle (phone guy advised me), a Blazin' River, and a Brownie. Delivery guy was at my door in about 20 minutes and was very friendly. FOOD WAS AMAZING!!! I would come back to Cleveland just for this food. They need to open a spot in Philly.  GREAT JOB CLEVELAND PICKLE!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the best sandwich I've ever eaten in my life! I ordered the West-sider and it was delicious! Loved that it was pressed warm, with a crisp and sweet finish! I will definitely return to show off a great place in Cleveland. Mainly a takeout place so there isn't much room for seating."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking. No it's not a gay club. It's actually a little shop with some phenomenal sandwiches. It's a bit of a wait, but I think it's absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"There were no pickles on my sandwich!  I was looking forward to trying this place all week. I ordered my sandwich, it was given to me in a bag, and I walked back to work to eat it. To my utter disappointment the sandwich was void of pickles. No pickles on the sandwich, none on the side in the bag, despite on the menu saying that all sandwiches come with pickles and the ingredients list for my sandwich specifically stating a pickle in the middle.   There were no pickles! At a pickle place no less!   That's like going to an italian restaurant and getting a pasta dish and the restaurant forgetting to put pasta on the plate.  Oh well. I guess if you really like pickles and end up going here, specify that you actually want the pickles on your sandwich!"}
{"text":"I've heard some good things about Cleveland Pickle and as a sandwich lover I was very excited about the menu. I first visited the Lakewood location just to check it out but didn't get anything at the time. I left feeling annoyed with the lack of enthusiasm in service and asked for a small sample of the chicken salad and was informed in a very matter of fact way that \"they don't do samples\"...as if I was a homeless person asking for a hand out. But because the menu looked so yummy I decided to check out the downtown location...again \"we don't do samples\"! Seriously...ok fine I'll chop it up to a tight grip on food cost. I ordered the the terminal because when I asked what kind of chicken was used the canned chicken from a distributor did not sound appealing. Call me a food snob but it's Cleveland pickle, use local chicken or heck even something not from a can. My gf ordered the Westsider which I ended up eating half of bc my terminal had no sign of apricot jam simply tasted like spicy mustard and ham:/ My gf then noticed we had no pickles...no pickle in the middle and none on the side? A pickle place and we got no pickles? When we asked about the pickle we were told the westsider pickle serving is in the form a sweet radish relish which is listed on the pickle key located on the front of the menu...cute idea in theory but as the worker ( perhaps the owner) noted many people miss the key. As for my terminal, I just didn't get one bc their order hadn't come in yet. I was offered pickle chips instead if I had my heart set on a pickle and upon reading these reviews I'm confused is the normal a pickle spear or pickle chips? Either way you can't be Cleveland pickle and just give no pickle! Lastly, short and sweet the bread was stale:/"}
{"text":"The Cleveland Pickle is a tasty sandwich shop located downtown near E. 9th street. The place is really tiny, only two tables and about 4 bar stools, and no where really to sit outside so be prepared to have to take your sandwich to go. The menu features several delicious sounding sub sandwiches, and a few salads.  My sub had turkey, ham, salami, lettuce, tomato and mayo. Oh, and some of the best pickles ever. It was quite tasty. The pickles made it the best. I thought the prices, $9-$11 for a sub, were high. It wasn't the hugest sub, for example, you would not be able to share it between two people. Half would not be enough. Chips and a drink were extra, ranging about $3-$4.  You better be on foot, too, as there is no parking nearby."}
{"text":"Wow what a great sandwich!  This is a great non-chain option for a delicious toasty sandwich. Hubby had the Clevelander and I had the West Coast. Both were served with a side of Christmas flavored pickles. We were in town to visit the rock 'n roll hall of fame and thought we should get a sandwich. We stopped in and really enjoyed all the Cleveland decor. They even had the Cleveland skyline, so cool. Large portions and delicious combinations definitely stop in. It's also a short walk to the rock 'n roll Hall of Fame from here. And the staff was friendly and happy to serve up a great sandwich. Cleveland pickle rocks!"}
{"text":"My first experience was at the downtown location so I was happy to visit the Lakewood locale.  I'd recommend this place.  Is it a couple dollars more? Yes.  But you pay for quality and I'd rather support local family run places than a chain.  The owners were nice and the place is clean and they had a variety of interesting sandwiches"}
{"text":"I love you, love you, I love you, Sweet pickles deli. I am counting the hours til we meet again. I can't wait to introduce you to my husband, son and girlfriend.  You are on my mind a lot!. I will see you soon dear friend. Sleep well."}
{"text":"Looking for a good, tasty sandwich in downtown Cleveland?  Then go to The Pickle!  Every time I eat here, I crave the sandwich for days.  I absolutely love the Payne Avenue which is a fantastic combination of Asian pork meatballs and veggies.  But the adobo sauce takes it to the next level.  Another absolute favorite is the East Sider.  It's kinda like the sophisticated cousin of the BLT.  There are many sandwiches that either don't have meat or can be prepared without meat that makes my (vegitarian) coworker very happy.  Even though I am still stuffed from the sandwich I ate at lunch (because they're big) I'm already thinking about returning for another taste treat sensation.  YUM!  The place is small so don't plan on eating there unless you happen to snag one of the few tables.  However, the staff is uber friendly and they seem to always be playing a very interesting mix of music."}
{"text":"This place is by me.  I've really been wanting to go there - i heard good things.  I got a salad.  (I dont know why....I guess I was in the mood for a salad.)  It was not full of stuff, as I had hoped.  It really wasn't all that big.  Also, the guy at the counter (very nice) asked me what dressing I wanted then didnt give me a dressing!  I got it to go (I think it's all \"to go\" there) and I had to search my fridge for a decent dressing.  He had me thinking I was crazy!    So, not really a good experience.  I'll try it again and get a sandwich next time."}
{"text":"The Payne Avenue Panini ($9) was solid - Asian pork meatballs, pickle, cilantro, adobe spread, and lime.  $9 probably strikes most as a little high for the relatively modestly-sized sandwich (but not small by any stretch of the imagination), but what you're paying for is the increase in quality and taste over a boring old $5 footlong.  The adobo spread is a little too spicy for my taste, but I usually shy away from really spicy food.  The cilantro and lime are great accents, though the taste of the meatballs gets a little lost among all this flavoring.  Sandwiches come with a small and tasty side of pickle chips, which are cuts of the pickle flavor of the day.  I wouldn't plan on sitting down and eating at Cleveland Pickle unless you get there a bit early:  The small shop has 3 tables and a small counter against a wall with about 16 stools total (and probably not enough space to fill all those seats).  The line goes out the door when there are more than eight people waiting to make an order.  It took 11 minutes for me to line up just outside the door until food was in my hand."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood sandwich shop. If you love carmelized anything this is the place. Prices a little steep. Ingredients fresh. Excellent garlic sauce"}
{"text":"Smells delish!!!!  Forgot the sammy but it was REALLY good. (yeah wel it better be for 10 bucks!!!!) Well it was and if you find yourself downtown some time go and try it! I plan on hitting it again just to confirm that it was in fact that good or I was just REALLY hungry.... HA!"}
{"text":"Wooooooowwwzers, what great sandwiches!  This place kills it with every single thing on their menu.  If I had to select one, I would have to go with the Downtowner.  This sandwich is truly life changing.  And no, I'm not overreacting!    Goat Cheese, Pine Nuts, Spinach, Roasted Tomato Pesto (what?) balsamic apricot spread (double what?) and finish off with their house-made Naked Pickles - now that, is a sandwich that can compete with the best of them!   My favorite type of pickle are those that still retain the cucumber taste, and these are them.  They are so good, I beg for extra!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to check out this sub shop, but was a bit hesitant due to the reviews; people either love this place or hate it. Well, I am so glad I decided to give this place a shot! I drove on into Lakewood and got a parking spot on the street right outside the shop, very convenient. (Also convenient that the Lakewood location is open until 8pm). I strolled on in and was greeted by a personable woman working the front. She was helpful with telling me what the subs were all about and which ones were popular. Since I had just received a coupon in the mail for a buy one get one half off, I decided to take advantage and try two different subs (yeah that's right, both for me!).   I opted for the West-Sider and the Payne Ave Panini. The West-Sider is a pressed sandwich with smoked turkey, caramelized bacon, chihuahua cheese, relish, lettuce, and a roasted tomato garlic spread. I enjoyed the firmer crust from the sub being pressed, however, it smelled and tasted like they had used peanut oil with the press. The sub was tasty, I was just thrown off with the lingering peanut smell and taste.   The Payne Ave Panini is kind of like a Bánh mì as it has Asian pork meatballs, relish, cilantro, carrot threads, adobo spread, and lime. This sub was not pressed so the bread was softer and with the moist meatballs and the other ingredients, you are looking at a soggier interior, but it tasted good so I had no problem with that.   The subs run about $9, but with the coupon my total was $13.50. The subs are also pretty big so you could easily share, put yourself in a food coma, or be like me and have leftovers for the next three days. They also sell bags of chips with flavors like crab or dill, sides of pasta salad (I think, I don't remember), and bottles of root-beer. I do love the logo of a pickle climbing a building, and you get a little side of sliced pickles with every sub order, but here is where I don't give them 5 stars. For a place that is named Cleveland Pickle and makes their own pickles, you would expect them to be pretty great, (aka unique and full of flavor), nope. The pickles do have a nice crunch to them, but the flavor is definitely lacking and unremarkable.   All in all, I will be back!"}
{"text":"You can now stop you search for a great sandwich downtown. The always smiling faces behind the counter are ready to deliver you the best and freshest meal your dollar can buy. Try everything as often as you can, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town hands down. The owners are awesome and make incredibly fresh food. This new location is such a good fit in Lakewood. Much larger than their downtown shop. I encourage you to try everything before you pick your favorite."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good sandwich for lunch and found the Cleveland Pickle on Yelp. I had the downtowner and it was outstanding!  A great combination of flavor's between the goat cheese, tomato pesto and the balsamic apricot spread. So glad I stopped in there."}
{"text":"My first Cleveland Pickle experience @ the Lakewood location was a success and, they deliver! The \"Terminal\" is a must try. The combination of brie, apricot jam and mustard spread, outstanding. Another perk, they don't charge you a delivery fee - this may change since they just started delivering, but for now, a great perk! The only reason I didn't give them all 5 Stars was because of the bread. While I can tell it is homemade and LOVE that it is, the dough needs more salt for sure."}
{"text":"Went here while walking around downtown and am so glad I did.  The people running the place were super friendly and personable.  They had just finished making meatballs and let me try a sample.  For my order I had the Clevelander and a deviled egg.  They threw in an extra deviled egg and gave me a couple samples of their pickle of the day, a spicy balsamic pickle.  It was awesome.  Not that crisp but the flavor was strong. Somehow it wasn't too acidic though which I really liked. I got the Clevelander.  It was huge.  And perfect.  The bread was crunchy on the outside and chewy inside.  The toppings all blended together well (it had turkey, some kind of cheese, a garlic spread and some other items)  More than enough for two people.  It is a little pricey, but about the same as the Market at Flying Fig and Bogtrotters.  I believe it is on par with both of those places.  According to the owner, most of the items are homemade and they only look for the best ingredients to use.  I'm not downtown that often anymore but might make an exception just to come back."}
{"text":"I wish I had a photo of one of the many sandwiches I've had here, but I eat them before I ever get the chance! My favorite is the Eastsider-a delicious sandwich including pancetta, balsamic, cheese and my favorite, the garlic aioli spread, among other things. I know that everyone talks about Melt being their favorite sandwich shop, but Cleveland Pickle is hands down my favorite! I even have out-of-towners wanting to return here to eat! If you haven't experienced a sandwich here, you need to add it to your Cleveland bucket list ASAP!!!"}
{"text":"I had the \"Clevelander\" a 10\" + hoagie, very light on the meat ( the deli cuts were so thin, almost shaved) each bite consisted of 3% meat, 5% veggies and 92% hoagie bun. The pickles were some kind of awesome combination of dill and sweet pickle all in one not too soggy and just a little crunch. I would go back again but ask for double meat"}
{"text":"i heart the cleveland pickle. i have been a few times and it never disappoints. never.  i have had the westsider twice and then the payne ave. panini. so freaking amazing. i love that you receive a little side of pickles with each sammy.  the sandwiches are big in my opinion, so one could easily feed two.  the bags of chips are great choices to go along and there are a few desserts, i have yet to try. a little pricey, maybe for some, but i dont mind paying when the food is yummy. staff is friendly and very accommodating.i switched up my cheese and that was not a problem. my mouth is salivating right now......tummy growling. might have to make a run to the pickle!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Sandwich was fantastic and just what I was looking for. They put the mayo on kinda thick for my liking but I still thought it was great. Quick service too!0"}
{"text":"Small sandwich shop in downtown Cleveland across from Heinen's. A few small tables, but this place is mainly for takeout.   I ordered the westside sandwich. This sandwich is much higher quality than something you would get at Jimmy John's or Subway albeit a little pricier at $10. The toasted sesame bread, zesty tomato mayo, luxurious quantities of meat and the way the sandwich held together as I devoured bite after bite was fantastic. After I finished the sandwich, I wanted more. A sandwich is usually just a sandwich, but the Cleveland Pickle does it well in a way that distinguishes itself as something more, transcending the flavors of your everyday ho hum sandwich."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I am always offered mozzarella and basil, or \"garden vegetable\" sandwiches and sandwich shops. (BORING!) Not at Cleveland Pickle! At Cleveland Pickle you get a pickle, cashew, spinach, apricot jam sandwich, and you will wish you lived in Ohio so you could eat there all the time. Thanks Cleveland Pickle for being creative and delicious!"}
{"text":"I really, really, truly wanted to love this place.   Living right down the street, and having read copious glowing reviews for the downtown location, I was beyond pumped when I saw that Cleveland Pickle would be coming to lakewood.    First attempt was the classic pickle, which was completely average.  They make the common mistake of putting lettuce and tomato on sandwiches, then pressing them, leaving you with hot lettuce and tomato, semi-melted cheese, and still-cold meats.  The Terminal was my next attempt, and while it sounded exciting (apricot jam, Brie, mustard spread), it was also pretty blah, and skimpy on the very average quality deli meat ham.  They also forgot the side of pickles.  Still not giving up, I tried the blazin river chicken salad sandwich.  Turned out to be about three tablespoons of chicken salad on a bun, and none of the advertised \"spicy\".    My last, and probably final attempt was the Bahn Mi.  A soupy, goopy mess.  A Bahn mi should be light and fresh, with some crunch to it.  This had the most finely shredded carrots I've ever seen, and they turned to mush in the gobs of mayonnaisy sauce the thing was slathered in.  Also forgot the pickles again.    I'll stick to TJ's Butcher block from now on."}
{"text":"My favorite sub sandwich ever ...The Westsider. So very tasty. Nice place, good food, nice staff!"}
{"text":"CLEVELAND PICKLE, YOU'RE THE BEST. And fear not, fellow pickle-haters: You need not love this shop's signature food to love this shop's food. Anything made with pickles can be made without pickles, & some of the ingredients that include \"pickle\" in the name are not, in fact, pickles, but rather cleverly disguised names for certain sauces, relishes, etc. The staff is friendly & happy to help you work through the menu to figure out what you'll like best, even providing a menu that has its top three bestsellers highlighted.   I'm a big fan of the Payne Avenue Panini - though I'd call it a \"hot sub\" before I'd call it a panini - which features Asian-inspired flavors: pork meatballs, radish relish, cilantro, carrots, adobo sauce, lime.... HEAVEN. Also, it's enormous - as I gather all their sandwiches are - so it'll either keep you full or feed you for two meals. Their sandwiches are pretty messy, so frankly, they're better eaten in than taken to go, but whatever you decide, you're probably going to leave happy."}
{"text":"Yum yum yummy! They have some delicious and very filling sandwiches! I had the westsider and it was very satisfying. The carmelized bacon was spot on! And the sauce was so tasty.   They are a bit pricey ($20 for 2 sandwiches) but otherwise a great lunch spot. They give you some pickles after you order and I have to say they were pretty tasteless and not great. You would think for having pickle in the title they would have the best pickles on earth. Not the case here. They tasted more like a flavorless cucumber. :( The sandwiches are very big though and enough to split for 2. I saved my other half for dinner and I'm glad I did. They also have some good vegetarian options here if you don't eat meat. Overall, great sandwiches with a lot of delicious and fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Great subs with an awesome taste.  The caramelized pancetta makes for a really distinct combination.  Get the deviled eggs and make sure you get enough for sharing because they go fast; really fast.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's a small hidden gem on Euclid and 9th. The staff is really friendly and the sandwiches are amazing. Anytime I feel like going out for lunch this is my first choice. Best sandwiches in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Fantastic Classic sandwich... Definitely needed extra napkins and the price is a bit steep... But I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for lunch at work and OMG! I was beyond pleased! I had the westsider which is a turkey club kind of sandwhich and it was amazzing. The Tomato parmesean soup was also great. I have already recommended a guest of my hotel he went and came back and thanked me becaue his food was great as well. Will be back and will not hesitate to recomend!"}
{"text":"For the first time visiting the Cleveland pickle I was not overly impressed. Called 15 minutes before they opened and was told to call back when they are open to order. ( why did you answer?) when I picked up my order I sat there for 15 minutes before I was told they have my order to someone else. Didn't even get a sorry. Sandwich was ok but for the price could have got jimmy johns which delivers. Atleast they had vegetarian options which was a plus. 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"The Pickle is one of my favorite downtown lunchtime haunts due to its well-rounded assortment of chef-driven sandwiches, soups, and salads. Prices are higher than other sandwich shops, but you definitely get what you pay for here. I'm partial to the meat-free Downtowner sandwich (mmm, goat cheese) and the A-Town salad (pretty sure they sprinkle crack in the chicken cake). Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Not only do they have excellent pickles, but their sandwiches are delicious! The sandwich had a distinct taste that cannot be replicated. Highly suggest for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was ok! The price was expensive $10.00 which was overpriced and over rated for what I received! I will pass this place next go around."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were excellent. We had the Terminal, the West-Sider, and the Downtowner. Plus, the Deviled Eggs were outstanding."}
{"text":"5 out of 5 stars, anyone who gave this place a bad rating must be too picky or not like a good sandwich. I love pickles and this place did not dissapoint me.   I got the original without the spicy pickles i subbed regular ones and took the shoreliner home. i havent been in lakewood in forever i stopped in here on a whim. OMMFG their sandwiches are friggen amazing.  Staff was friendly and helpful, music was cool, tasty craft root beer and i paid the amount i woulda paid for like a loaded BMT at subway or any regular sandwich at paninis but got hand crafted delicious sandwiches that were leaps n bounds better. Juicy and so much taste and pressed on a hot grill and with a side of delicious pickles. I will be going here EVERY time i am near."}
{"text":"Great owner/staff and killer sandwiches.  Classic pickle is a work of art.  Thank god I don't live close by or I'd eat here every day.  Menu is a little bit of an SAT test with its \"pickle legend\" you have to use to decipher, but totally worth it :)"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today and the place was surprisingly un-busy for lunch hour, but that made service extra-fast. Very friendly counter service, welcoming and willing to field questions about menu items.  The sandwiches are pretty big and feature interesting toppings. More than your standard turkey or Italian sub. I ordered the Terminal, which consisted of ham, brie, apricot jam, spinach and mustard, all melted together as the sandwich is pressed (as are most of Cleveland Pickle's offerings). It was very tasty and I gobbled it right up, but the $8-$9 price point for just the sandwich is maybe a bit much for everyday lunch.  Sandwiches are served with a wee plastic cup of three or four pickle chips. They are also tasty, but with a name like Cleveland Pickle you could pony up a few more pickles, if you ask me!  Cleveland Pickle also serves breakfast sandwiches, which I haven't tried yet, but should be a welcome addition to the morning rush on Euclid Avenue."}
{"text":"The pickles ARE really good, and both my westsider sandwich and the soup (some sort of roasted tomato? can't remember) were absolute heaven on a frigid, windy day. I came in during an off-peak time too, and the guys behind the counter were very nice."}
{"text":"I got the Classic Pickle. It was a very good sandwich. Kind of messy to eat. Much more garlic than I thought it would have. I am not complaining about the garlic, but probably made the office smell of garlic. Hope I didn't annoy my coworkers. But it was a good sandwich."}
{"text":"I love this spot! I seriously don't think I've ever had anything here that I didn't like. First of all, it's a great Cleveland-themed place, with all the sandwiches being named after Cleveland places or things. While this location does have a few tables with stools, it's really more of a take-out place. The sandwiches are subs (some are panini pressed) and the breads are really good - always fresh. My favorites are the westsider (a creative take on a turkey club- the pancetta is SO good), the payne ave panini (aptly named after the main street of cleveland's asiatown neighborhood, this is an asian meatball sub), and the downtowner (I'm a sucker for a veggie sub that has creative ingredients - the balsamic apricot spread makes this one for me). And, how can I not talk about the pickles!? You'll get a side of pickles with every sandwich- different kinds come with different sandwiches. I'm not a huge fan of wasabi pickles, but all the other kinds I've really enjoyed! The garlic are my fave. The pickles are house-made and really tasty! Finally, just a note, the sandwiches here are $8-10, and that includes only the side of pickles. It's a little pricey for everyday, but I think the quality ingredients make it worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch based on Yelp reviews, overall I was not as impressed as other people I guess.  While the turkey sandwich I had was good, it was not 5 stars, it was not even 4.  And the pickles?  They were kind of sweet and not at all what you would think a gourmet pickle would be, that is, if you ever imagined a gourmet pickle."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love pickles? If you don't, but love tasty sandwiches, than Cleveland Pickle is worth a try. If you don't like pickles or sandwiches; I feel sorry for you... I digress. After a bit of a struggle , I finally settled on the Clevelander. It was huge, and delicious. Soft homemade bread, perfect meat to bread ratio... I'll be back for a hot pressed Sammy (I suspect this is where they really shine)."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in Lakewood and we came here for lunch recently.  I got the Blazin' River, an order of the deviled eggs and a bag of habanero potato chips.  Everything was tasty but I especially loved the deviled eggs which they make with their pickle relish.  The habanero chips were also good and I wish I could get them where I live."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich in The Clevelander with a few different meats. Made to order fresh ingredients and fair with the meat to bread ratio. Friendly service. Unavailable in half sandwich. Hey, I can live with that, make for two meals. Decent price. Tiny shop will likely go to Key Plaza or Public Square and enjoy the weather, if possible. Otherwise, the office or car will have to do."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy going to local Lakewood restaurants since we like to walk in our neighborhood, try new restaurants and support small local businesses. We just went to Cleveland Pickle for the first time tonight and it is a keeper! The sandwiches were excellent and so was the service. We are glad Cleveland Pickle has come to Lakewood and we think you will be too."}
{"text":"So even though this is a sandwich shop, I got deviled eggs and a salad that were awesome. The salad was loaded with goat cheese and had an awesome vinaigrette dressing. The deviled eggs had tons of flavor and were messy. My friend got a sandwich which also looked pretty good."}
{"text":"The Cleveland Pickle is conveniently located and you will always be greeted with a smile! If you are looking to have your taste buds fulfilled,  the Pickle is the perfect place for this! Panini pressed , hot or cold cuts, deliciously put together with flavorful sauces! I'm always satisfied with every last bite! Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Went to Cleveland Pickle for lunch yesterday.   I didn't think it lived up to the hype. Will I go back? Yes, and I hope my rating goes up as well. I had the Westsider and it was nothing special. It was very soggy with the coleslaw(?) which I didn't see in the description? I also could not find the garlic spread? Maybe that was the coleslaw? Regardless, it wasn't bad but it also wasn't great. It was honestly just so wet and soggy which would not have bothered me if we had taken it to go but we sat and ate it immediately.  By boyfriend got the Classic Pickle and we both agreed his sandwich was much better. They also have Route 11 potato chips which are amazing and reason enough to go back. I'm really hoping to enjoy it more next time."}
{"text":"Having been to the location downtown- I was elated to have a location so close. I eat pickles at every meal, one of my favorite foods! But then I ordered the banh mi meatball sub- one of the most disappointing subs of my life. Sad for meatballs and very very sad for banh mi. I'm pretty sure it was mayo/sauce and then bread and then a meatball and then some veggies. I was so disgusted by the mayo ratio.. I'm not sure I can return. Reading other yelp reviews confirms it. Menu is yummy but actual product falls so short and then add the whopping price?? I just moved from DC where they charge the same for lunch!!! And even there they give you a better sandwich."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Cleveland Pickle with my co-worker recently as this was one of the few sandwich shops that I hadn't tried. It smelled good and it was a small joint. In fact, there were only about four tables to sit at, so during busy hours, plan on a to-go meal.    I asked the sandwich maker which were the most popular grinders and he said the Clevelander, the Eastsider and the Westsider.  I went with the Clevelander, which has Genoa salami, black forest ham, smoked turkey, lettuce, tomato, onion, white cheddar, sliced pickles, and roasted garlic mayo.  It took about 8 minutes to make our subs.  They were served cold, but I noticed a sandwich press being used in the back.  I wish I would've gotten mine pressed. Anyway, the sandwich was large - a full foot long!  It was tasty and of good quality with fresh ingredients. But in today's world of awesome subs, this one was just average. 10 years ago, I probably would've given it four stars, but I must give it three. In the wake of my recent visit to Herb N Twine, the sandwich bar has been raised in Cleveland.  For the price, $12.50 with chips, drink, and pickles I was expecting a knock-your-socks-off experience.  I didn't get that. The subs are $10 of that $12. The sandwich was served with some soft, tasty pickle slices.  They were very good. The meal was very filling.  I didn't need the habanero potato chips, but they left my moth burning all the way back to work, which I liked.  It's funny that the word \"habanero\" was written in small letters on the very bottom of the chip bag and would not be seen by many people. In fact, the woman next to me exclaimed, \"Oh my God! Those are hot...I wasn't expecting them to be so hot!\", when she bit into her first inconspicuous habanero chip.  My co-worker wasn't impressed, especially with the price.  I'm glad I tasted a sub here and maybe I'll stop by for a hot one sometime next year."}
{"text":"Have always wanted to try this place and so glad I did! A bit pricier than I expected, but the sandwiches are very large. All are very unique so if you're looking for a regular turkey sandwich you won't find it. Their garlic sauce is awesome!"}
{"text":"So I saw alot of other complaints about parking in reviews, but people, there is a FREE trolley (the E line) that has a stop literally at their front door. Why park?? Anyway, I have tried the clevelander and the downtowner which were both great. I loved the downtowner, as an amazing veggie option. All the flavors worked perfectly together and was perfectly melted. They also had some good root beer for purchase as well as great kettle chips. Gluten free if that matters for you. The guy cooking and the girl at the counter were very friendly and wecoming. You know sometimes u go places and there are the superior hipster types, which I find unpleasant;) all in all a great lunch for a great price."}
{"text":"The Clevelander was dynamite! Highly recommend that sandwich with everything on it.  Delivery was very fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Average sandwich shop. Nothing wrong with the food or service but there are much better places in lakewood."}
{"text":"This place is great. Awesome prices and the food is just as good. They give you so many pickles on your sandwich and they are some of the best pickles I've ever had. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a quick sandwich that actually tastes good"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to check out Cleveland Pickle today, and I feel cheated.... out of all the amazing lunches I could have been eating all this time had I gone earlier!  YUM!!!!!!  I got the Downtowner - a vegetarian masterpiece with goat cheese, fresh spinach, cucumbers/pickles and other delicious stuff. It was soooooooo delicious!  The girl who took our order could not have been more friendly, and the curry pickles were delicious!  You can order deviled eggs here!  I cannot wait to try all the other sandwiches. I was really torn between this and the Cardiac Kid - I'm a sucker for \"Elvis\" flavored anything (that is, banana and peanut butter).   I thought the price was right on for the quality ingredients in the sandwich. It is a little pricier than, say, Subway, but... come on. This is in a totally different stratosphere. I mean, APRICOT JAM was part of my day! So, sitting down to lunch, my day became exponentially fancier!  All in all, a true winner! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Cleveland Pickle has made a sandwich lover out of me.  See, my husband adores all types of sandwiches - paninis, subs, wraps, melts - to him, any sandwich is amazing.  For me, I generally feel like I could do a better job in my own kitchen.  Most places use cheap meat, cheap cheese, cheap bread - so why spend the money?  On those three things alone, CP is blowing everyone else away.  They are using delicious, quality meats and cheeses and some of the best sandwich bread I've had.  That alone would keep me coming back.  But they have homemade mayos, spreads, relishes, and pickles that really give the sandwiches personality.  Even their chicken salad sandwich isn't some boring version with plain mayo - it's spicy and chipotle chicken with a yummy relish spread.  The hours are a little wacky (mainly weekday lunch) BUT they are doing Saturday lunch now. So go then. And say hi to me. Because I'll probably be there every Saturday."}
{"text":"Pickle Pickle Pickle.  I'm a sandwich guy.  This places does sandwiches above and behind what you would expect.  That means? I love it.  They call it a gourmet sub shop, and it is.  It's the perfect execution of trendy (but not too much), tasty (but accessible), and down home (I could make these, if I had days).    I've had the Classic Pickle and the Blazin River.  Quite honestly, the Classic Pickle didn't travel the 10 minutes home very well, but its flavors remained and were excellent.  The Blazin River? Amazin.  I never tried a chicken salad sub before because...well...why the hell do I want my chicken shredded into a scoopable form? Well I was wrong because they did it right here.  Downside?  There's no 5 dollar footlong at Cleveland Pickle.  It's more like a 8-10 dollar footlong.  It's on the top end of my typical lunch spend, but you get what you pay for.  TIP: Pick up a jar of hot pickles to go."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! We were traveling to Chicago and decided to give this place a try (reviews were good). We had a grilled cheese, the Champ and the Turkey Club! We will definitely be back. We even got recommendations for a nice lunch spot in the park."}
{"text":"Per a recommendation I stopped in to try the East-sider Sandwich. It was delicious. Not healthy, but delicious. I say not healthy because it was dripping with excess roasted garlic spread mixed with balsamic dressing. Slathered in all that was beefsteak tomato, pancetta, provolone and fresh basil. The sandwich was then heated and flattened panini style.   The flavor combination was wonderful. I would definitely order this sandwich again and maybe even get a taste for it.   Everything is made to order so it can be customized as your dietary restrictions require. The sandwich does not come with chips, but it does come with a small side of perhaps half a dozen pickle chunks. The pickles are good; they are on the sweeter side.   Online order and delivery is available via GrubHub.    PSA: Mama Zuma's Habanero Potato Chips are HOT. And I never think anything is hot. My mouth is still burning."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch. Really liked the Clevelandy vibe of the place. The sandwiches have locally inspired names and they have a really cool artistic rendition of the skyline on the wall, featuring a pickle climbing the Terminal Tower! Not a lot of room is you eat in the restaurant, or for waiting for your sandwich for that matter, but the service was pretty quick and friendly. I had the Lake Effect (tuna salad sandwich) and it was really delicious. The bread is really good. Pretty good price too, only $7 for a great sub. I definitely recommend checking it out on a lunch break some time!"}
{"text":"Anything having to do with pickles and I'm in. Pause for dirty thoughts.  So when I was perusing Yelp for a quick bite to eat around our hotel I was happy to see the Cleveland Pickle come up. I'm pretty hard on sandwiches, so to impress me, you have to be a solid slice of heaven. This, my friends, sure was!   Me and the hubs split a West-Sider (smoked turkey, pancetta, chihuahua cheese, pickle in the middle, roasted tomato, garlic spread AND a pickle). We only wanted a small bite, but it was crazy that this was an individual sized hoagie split down the middle. It was massive! But seriously, if I was hungry, I would have housed that entire thing myself!  Every ingredient blended together perfectly in the toasted bread. And the pickles! They give you a side of them in a small cup. The special that day was garlic. It had a hint of it, but not too much that you would be scared to be next to me. I actually liked it so much I just HAD to order another order of pickles!  The pickle reins supreme here! Well, the pickle and the sandwiches, a killer combo!"}
{"text":"Some things in life I want fast: cars, women and subs. This place offers none of these things. A 2pm lunch pickup on a Tuesday with no line should not take 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Tried the Burning River Chickan salad sandwich. It  was awesome! Just the right amount of heat, very flavorfull. I would recommend this place. I can't wait to try some more sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This place is the shite. Anyone who says differently is a commie. That's right. Things I love about the Pickle: -the goddam subs -Zeb -zeb's smokin hot wife -condiments: LATHER. They lather that shite on as requested. I love that. -papperkash. -ken RDMKR. Formerly known as Reddstone Ken. He's there a lot.  -soup. I freakin love the CP's soup."}
{"text":"I can't wait till this place is open on Saturdays! Living downtown, it sucks when I'm off of work for a day and discover an amazing food place that only has daytime weekday hours, but I was glad to hear they will be adding Saturday hours once our neverending cold season decides to end!   Anyways, LOVED this place. I got the Blazin River and it was AMAZING!! They make fresh chipotle chicken salad every morning so they'll tell you just how spicy it is. I like spicy but can't stand TOOOOO much spice, but decided to get it. Definitely spicy- but definitely worth it! I can't wait to try the other sandwiches on the menu. Apparently they deliver too!   Ironically, I wasn't a fan of their pickles that they put on the side - but I pretty much only like dill pickles, so that's just personal preference.  :)  - update: they begin saturday hours on April 13th!"}
{"text":"I've already been to the location on Detroit. Staff was a little more upbeat, actually greeting people...NICELY lol. I was anxious to try the Terminal sandwich (previously had the Westsider which was really good) and I thought it wasn't that good...the pickles I got wasn't sweet...it tasted like regular pickles. I don't know if it is different pickles for different sandwiches but I didn't too much care for not only the pickles but the Terminal sandwich.   I do like the convenient location, it is right across the street from my job and they also deliver!"}
{"text":"Of the food only...  Not even thinking about customer service but strictly the food. I ordered the West Sider and it was AH-MAY-ZING! The sandwich was nice, hot and delicious. I loved the garlic spread and the coleslaw on the sandwich, very flavorful. Didn't really expect the sandwich to be this good, honestly it was like an explosion when I took the first bite. Definitely not your other sub sandwiches places. I did find it a little pricey but it is really worth it.  I wanted to try the homemade rice krispy treats but they were all out.  Have to go back and try other things on the menu...have my eye on the Terminal lol.      **Maybe the Downtown location is more friendlier than the Lakewood location...but you didn't hear that from me**  This is only about the food :)"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and very nice employees. What a great Cleveland find for our sisters weekend."}
