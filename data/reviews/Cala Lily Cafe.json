{"text":"We had been to this place once before when it first opened and had a bad experience.  Our neighbors convinced us to give it a second chance and I wish we had gone somewhere else.  While the soup was good my meal was under cooked, nearly raw pork, and my wife's meal was nothing special.  When you consider the price, $100+ for two, I would expect a better experience.  We live close but will not return."}
{"text":"The decor needs an update - it's like grandmas parlor! BUT!! The food is awesome! it's always consistent! I have ordered the same things many times and it's always great!!! Tortellini with crab meat is to die for and one of the few places in Pgh that has escargot! The crowd is a little older in the dining room but I think you can sit in the bar area if you want too -they get busy! You may have to wait a little longer than the chains for your food but it's worth it!! A reservation is a good idea on weekends! Fresh cooked -GOOD-food takes time! 
Filet mignon is very good too!! I always say it's the \"food\" not the decor that make a restaurant! Great Food!!"}
{"text":"I really, really like their food and the people who work here.  Very nice bartenders, very nice host and hostess.  Reasonable pricing, as well.  Recommended."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to \" place when we want to treat ourselves to an upscale dining experience.

Although the exterior doesn't look particularly inviting, the food is always excellent.  This restaurant is a hidden gem in the North Hills."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Everything I, and all in my party, had was amazing.  Excellent service.   Classy, but unpretentious atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you haven't had a chance to check out Cala Lily Cafe, you are seriously missing out.  Chef Rivera is a wizard in the kitchen, and by wizard, I mean the Dumbledore in cuisine, ha.  

Although everything at Cala Lily is obscenely delicious, I'll recommend a few of my favorite dishes for you guys.  To start, the Maine lobster and crab bisque is heavenly - rich, creamy deliciousness for real. The stuffed hot banana peppers are also a treat.  OH, and you're served house-made rolls.  I'm crazy about carbs, so this was a real treat for me.  I'm always down for freshly baked bread.  I probably ate three of these when I went my first time, ha.

Anywho, for entrees, I highly recommend - my personal favorite - the pumpin tortellini with jumbo crab.  Chef Riversa tosses the pasta in a rich, creamy alfredo sauce with leeks and roasted tomatoes.  This dish is SO well balanced, and the pumpkin filling is to die for. It's seriously the perfect combination of savory and sweet.  Another favorite would be the filet mignon diane.  The steak is always perfectly cooked, and I guarantee the meat will melt in your mouth.

Cala Lily offers a nice assortment of desserts.  I have a favorite, but I totally forget the name of the dish (Cala Lily Rose?).  Oh well.  I'll just have to describe it to you guys.  It's chocolate covered ice cream served with fresh rasberries in Chambord.  Yeah.  It tastes just as ridiculous as it sounds.  Check it out STAT.

Oh, and on top of it all, the waitstaff here is amazing.  5 Stars in every way, hands down!  Cala Lily is a true gem."}
{"text":"A work friend recommended this restaurant. We went here on a snowy winter night. The Cala Lily is located in a dingy little shopping center on Route 8 in Gibsonia. I had been forewarned about the exterior, so we were brave enough to venture in. The interior is equally as bland, dimly lit as to try to disguise this. Tables are scattered about the open room, some interesting prints on the walls. Host staffed was very jolly and more than happy to check our coats for us. We were led to a table in the back, the place was packed. 

My bbf had pumpkin tortellini alfredo with lump crab, marinated tomatoes and leeks. He reported that he dish was good, although you didn't really recognize that it was pumpkin. I had Maryland style crab cakes. While they were good, they were not the best that I have had. I thought the restaurant was kind of pricey for the quality of the food. We don't get to Gibsonia very often, this is probably a place that we will go again when we are in the area. Service was very friendly and attentive. All in all, a very nice evening."}
