{"text":"Passed by this food cart one day and had to stop by to try it out. It was located on West Dayton Street, by Geology Museum!   The owner was nice and allowed me to make a combo of the Chicken Curry and Koftka (Beef Meatballs). Typically, you only order 1 of each that comes with rice. She was out of the Bolani (Patato or Leek Filled Turnovers) which I really wanted to try.  Between the two entree items, I liked the chicken a lot more than the Koftka. It was more flavorful and the flavor was stronger. The Kofta tasted good but not as powerful of a flavor.   I assume Afghan food is not spicy but I sure wish it were. I'd stop by again if it were in a more convenient location."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since my last review but Zam Zam brought me out from my hiding place! Walking through the forest of food trucks on Library Mall is like wading in the ocean and deciding what grain of sand you want - a pretty impossible task. Sometimes I just go with my first instinct and order what sounds good and is within my \"budget\" (usually one of those \"I only want to spend $5.00 on lunch today!\" budgets).  Today I chose Zam Zam. I am extremely happy I did. I ordered the chicken pita (unfortunately I didn't record the actual menu name for the dish) and waited a few minutes as it was prepared. The smells from this food truck are amazing! Very well presented dish - 1/2 pita (looks to be wheat) stuffed and topped with fresh greens and two different sauces. There was considerable weight to the dish and it smelled fantastic!  I found the nearest horizontal surface and poured on the two sauces before tasting them. The green sauce is herby and garlicly. The white sauce reminded me of a thin version of a falafel yogurt sauce with no dill and a little spice. Both were delicious and I was happy I decided to drown my food with them.  The chicken is very, very good! Crazy good! Great flavor and texture and an ample amount. This is a home run $5.00 Madison food cart dish! I don't think I have ever described something as \"perfectly balanced\" but that is how I would describe the chicken pita at Zam Zam - perfectly balanced. Fresh greens, perfect pita choice and complex flavors that surround very well cooked chicken. It's become harder and harder to find $5.00 food choices from a food cart around here. I know I haven't tried EVERY $5.00 selection from Madison's Food Cart scene, but as of the date I am writing this review, this is by far the best $5.00 dish from a food cart that I have had.  I'm definitely planning another visit (probably more than one) to try out the other selections from Zam Zam. If they are even 80% as good as their chicken pita I'll consider it a food truck worth hunting for on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. We ordered the borani and the gulpi. The borani was smothered in yoghurt which left little else to taste. Gulpi was bland. Pita slices were stale. And at $8-9 per plate for what were fairly small servings it all seemed way overpriced. Would not recommend"}
