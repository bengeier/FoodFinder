{"text":"Qualité de nourriture impeccable! Bon menu diversifié, pas trop épicé en général. Carte de cocktail de base, mais appréciée. Bon service et bonne ambiance. Je le recommande sans hésiter, un bon petit resto de région à découvrir. Terrasse idéale pour les soirées chaude d'été!"}

{"text":"I stumbled into this restaurant by accident, and decided to try it out. Ended up ordering entirely too much food, and ate way too many chips with salsa, but enjoyed every second of it. The guacamole was delicious, the tacos were great, the quesadilla was one of the best that I've had, and the beans could have been a meal all on their own. This was a very homey feel, sort of like having dinner over at your friends house. The owner was very nice, and let me practice my spanish, which I'm sure was quite painful for him."}
{"text":"Le restaurant m'a été fortement recommandé et j'ai vite compris pourquoi. La nourriture est excellente et le personnel très sympathique! Je recommande fortement la soupe et l'entrée de guacamole, mais assurez-vous de garder de la place pour le gateau 3 leche: je ne crois pas avoir jamais manger de dessert aussi bon dans un restaurant."}
{"text":"Had an overnight stop in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield and we didn't know anything about the town. The hotel restaurant seemed too expensive so we went to Tio Luis based on the previous Yelp review. It's located in a spot we would never had ventured to but it was absolutely worth it. 

We had a table in the back patio and the whole place was very homey, mom and pop, and totally casual. Service was friendly and the menu was short but that's a good thing!

The fajitas were served with warm corn tortillas, not flour tortillas - and that makes all the tasty difference!  Chips were home made with love, and all the flavours were simply delicious and all made with great ingredients. The portions were huge and the kids were stuffed sharing a single order of chicken quesadilla. Oh, and their potato salad - which I normally dislike - was one of the best I've had. So. Good. 

The kids loved it, and they're really picky eaters. Next time we are in the area, we will definitely eat here again. Merci beaucoup!!"}
