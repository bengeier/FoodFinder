{"text":"I stopped into Gotham last week for breakfast and service was so good, I came back this week for breakfast.  Again, I wasn't disappointed.  I won't gas on about both experiences, but I'll tell you what made the difference this morning.    I waved a couple customers ahead of me, because I was unsure of what I wanted and I thought I might be a little longer at the register.  When I stepped up and after ordering a bunch of bagels and cream cheese for the office, the young gentleman behind the counter asked me if I wanted any coffee or juice.  I said, \"No thanks, they can get their own coffee and juice.\"   His reply? \"I wasn't worried about them.  I was worried about you.\"  Hospitality.  That's what it was.  100% sincere and easy as pie.  More places should do it.  It takes but a few words to make a connection with a customer and win loyalty.  A little bit of loyalty goes a long, long way.   It only got better when he shouted out to the customers, \"Who's parked out front?!?!\"  I turn to see the parking enforcement man circling my car with a catlike grin on his face, rubbing his hands together greedily.  Okay, that's an exaggeration.  I ran out and managed to avoid the ticket.  Thanks, Gotham.    Bagels.  Hospitality.  And a hand with the meter man."}
{"text":"I have stopped going here. They were out of lox on a Saturday morning, so we went somewhere else, and just never bothered going back. It's too expensive, and they're often out of things. And, with the exception of maybe two guys who work here, everybody else has been rude, short, and seemingly annoyed, in my experience.  Also, I got really sick after I last ate here. And I'd had a bagel with cream cheese. How could that go wrong?"}
{"text":"Great bagels. By far, the best in Madison. I had an issue with a particular order of a dozen bagels. Spoke with the owner. He went out of his way to make everything fine. Gotham Bagels are excellent."}
{"text":"These are hands down the best bagels in Madison.  I'm from the east coast and I am spoiled on good NY style bagels.  Trust me, Einstein and Bagels Forever are not good bagels.  This place has a wonderful selection, the bagels are made right and very tasty.  My personal favorites are the sesame, onion, garlic and egg bagels.  I usually get a bagel and cream cheese  but i've tried a few of their other savory sandwiches like the egg breakfast bagel and the chicken salad sandwich which were wonderful as well.  My rating on the service here is that it is pretty standard.  The staff are generally friendly and the food is prepared quickly.  I recommend this place for a good bagel."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bagels in Madison.  Nothing else I have had in town should even be called a bagel.   They have great bagel sandwiches too.  This is always our first stop when heading to the farmer's market on saturday morning.  Park St. location is great as well."}
{"text":"Came here before the Illinois game and was very disappointed. First off, the guy running the cash register was an asshole. He was very crass and did not greet anyone or say thank you etc. He just screamed NEXT in your face even when you were standing right in front of him. I felt like screaming my order right back in his face. This guy looked like the manager or owner - He's heavyset and looks like he just woke up from up with a nice disheveled appearance.   I can deal with bad service if the food makes up for it, but this did not happen. I ordered a bagel with lox and scallion cream cheese. My bagel came with plain cream cheese...wtf? After I realized I had plain cream cheese I began to search for the lox. I couldn't taste any in my first bite. Looking...there don't seem to be any lox on my bagel. O wait there is one little piece - I can see it with my magnifying glass. O there is another the size of a sesame seed. What a joke. If I'm paying $8 for a bagel with lox you better load that thing with salmon. I kid you not there was one strip 1 cm thick on one half of the bagel. The other side literally had none.   This place is a joke and an insult to NYC bagels. It's an insult to the other great Madison restaurants as well. Close this place down and put in a park or a public toilet - something useful.   Gets two stars because the woman manning the coffee was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"This review is for the park street location.    My significant other and I went here and both got sick.   We shared an egg salad sandwich on a bagel.  A few hours later we both had seriously upset stomachs. No, I don't have any kind of absolute proof or anything, but it was all that we ate for the day at that point, and it seems highly coincidental that we'd both suffer from the exact same symptoms at about the same time.  It took us out of commission for the rest of the day.  The egg salad did taste a little funky, and we probably shouldn't have eaten it, but we both assumed that the taste had something to do with an herb or spice they added.  I guess we were wrong.    I hope Gotham bagels will make sure to use only fresh egg salad from now on.  We're not going to mess with it again.  Groannn."}
{"text":"PUMPERNICKEL BAGELS.  Outside of NYC, it is so f-ing hard to get a pumpernickel bagel to go with lox.  But Madison's Gotham Bagels got it done.  And reasonable pricing too."}
{"text":"A bagel a day keeps the doctor away.  That's the saying, right?  I have been going to Gotham for years.  I used to work right across the street and I would frequent this shop regularly. I love this place so much!   I get how some people who have to drive would be upset about the parking around the area, or about the no frills staff members, but as Bruce Hornsby would say, \"that's just the way it is.\"   I find those negatives to be positives.  Gotham has a New York feel, and while it may not be as authentic as a bagel shop actually located in the Big Apple, it is as close as it's going to get in Madison, WI.    Different from other bagel shops in the area,  whose only requirement is that the college girl working behind the counter knows how to type in :30sec on the microwave, Gotham actually makes their bagels in house.  They have a range to cook up food like eggs, sausage, bacon, etc.  All of these things lead to an amazing breakfast sandwich.  They have salads, soups, and other sandwiches that make you want to come back for more.    I have met the owner multiple times, and while he is a straight-shooting kind of guy, he is nice and set out to create a quality product that gives residents of Madison a little taste of the big city."}
{"text":"First business Ive ever had to look up the owner to make sure this wasn't a complete joke.   Way overpriced, rude service, I am disappointed I wasted my time.   Joke's on me, you got me - never again though."}
{"text":"I'm a native New Yorker and can be quite high-maintenance when it comes to a bagel shop, so you may want to take this review with a grain of salt.  Or it may give you insight.  Either way...  The bagels themselves are awesome.  Barring visits back home and care packages my mother sends, I seriously have not had a bagel this good since I moved to Wisconsin 9 years ago.  They even have salt bagels, which can be hard to find.  However, let's do a little comparison, shall we?  http://tinyurl.com/ysa7fk (NY Bagel shop menu) http://tinyurl.com/2bwvra (Gotham menu)  Gotham is WAY overpriced compared to what I'm used to in a normal NYC or Long Island bagel shop.  I was absolutely shocked at the prices.  To give a few examples:  --The Williamsburg is $9.50 at Gotham vs. $5.69 for the equivalent in NY.  And both places use Boar's Head meats, so that's not the issue.  The amount of meat is definitely not the issue, either.  You get more in NY.  --My favorite, a sesame bagel with scallion cream cheese, is $3.00 at Gotham, vs. $2.16 for the equivalent in NY.  And I shouldn't even say \"equivalent,\" because the amount of cream cheese a real NYC or LI bagel shop will put on a bagel puts Gotham to shame - so at Gotham, you pay more for less.  --For a bagel with plain cream cheese and a 12oz. coffee, you'll pay a total of $3.75 vs. the $2.07 breakfast special in NY.  --The flavored cream cheeses (particularly the scallion) are a little runny and also quite overpriced - $6.25 for 8oz vs about $3.60 in NY.  Granted, it's made from \"premium artisanal\" cream cheese, but there's just not enough of a taste difference to justify the price difference.  They have the flavor absolutely nailed, but for that price, I'll make my own.  --Any self-respecting bagel shop in NY trying to charge $9.50 a dozen will throw in at least 6 bagels free, sometimes more.  The one my mom frequents does buy-a-dozen-get-six for $7.95, and buy-a-dozen-get-a-dozen on Sundays.  --And come on - $3.00 for a cup of fresh-squeezed OJ?  $1.50 for a can of soda? Try a $1.39 pint of Tropicana or YooHoo or a 75-cent can of soda.  The day my husband and I went in together, we spent a grand total of $40 for items what would have cost around $25 total at a shop on Long Island.  And to top it all off, I ordered another container of cream cheese to go before we left, and the girl behind the counter took the orders of at least 4 more people before she got my container of cream cheese.  That would NOT have flown in NY.  I've been told that the owner was born on Long Island and raised in Brooklyn.  If this is true, he needs to get back to his roots and stop gouging his customers.  Despite the drawbacks, the bagels will bring me back - but only as an occasional treat.  If you're a native NYer like I am, you'll fall in love with the bagels, but the prices are just crap."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and would try and frequent it on the weekends--but this place hows gone WAY DOWN HILL!  I keep going back hoping that they get better but no such luck.  The service is terrible and they treat customers like you are bugging them when ordering. They ALWAYS get my order wrong ( I get the tofu spread- cant eat cheese) and when I try and get my order fixed they make a fuss.  But worst of all- the people making your bagels do not wear gloves. They handle money at the register and go straight to making your food without washing their hands. Terrible.  I used to love this place and now I refuse to ever go back."}
{"text":"GREAT bagels! GREAT cream cheese!  My only complaint was the coffee. It tasted like it had been sitting for hours and hours- somewhat like cardboard. It was pretty much undrinkable, and I am not a coffee snob- I'll drink gas station coffee. Of course, here's hoping this was a one-time occurrence."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I would come here pretty frequently for breakfast, and we have always had a good experience. I'm pretty sure the owner started remembering us, as he started speaking to us as though we were friends. However, we had a very terrible experience this weekend. We ordered out usual, 2 toasted bagels with cream cheese. We waited 10-15 minutes for a pretty simple order, but we were mostly fine with that because this place can get pretty busy on weekends. However, when we got our order, neither of our bagels were toasted. My boyfriend brought them back up and explained the situation to the owner who happened to be preparing the bagels that day. He seemed to get angry when we  informed him for some reason. He did end up remaking our order correctly, but he brought it over to our table and stated that he would \"give us a lesson about bagels.\" That \"lesson\" turned out to be him explaining that when you put cream cheese on a warm bagel, it cools it off. Okay? That's common sense, and he really didn't need to speak to us like we've never ate/made a bagel before or as if we were in a 1st grade science class. The problem wasn't the temperature of our food anyway. Having a bagel toasted is more of texture thing. He could have easily apologized for getting our order wrong and fixed it, but instead he tried to make it seem as though we were wrong for ordering and not getting the correct thing. We honestly would have been totally fine with it regardless of the reason (simple mistake, being very busy, etc), but the level of condescending disrespect we received from the owner of all people was a huge problem. Not cool, man."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Try the specialty sandwiches!! Very good with fresh squeezed orange juice. Gotham is a great alternative to long breakfast waits or pricey brunches."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite bagel place in Madison, but I was there yesterday when my husband and I both saw an employee drop a bagel on the floor, pick it up, and put it back in the container for sale...I approached the owner and told him about the incident and he and the employee denied it. He, the owner, also denied being the owner when I asked him directly if he was the owner. I'm giving up my favorite bagels for health/safety concerns and because denying you're the owner is poor customer service--be warned!"}
{"text":"I am very confused by people saying that their bagels are too big. They are smaller than the bagels that you get in NYC. There is also no such thing as a bagel that is too big.   Obviously, without the magic of New York water, you can't make a real New York bagel. But for the midwest, they're pretty damn close. It's a little pricey, sure, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I hope to go back very soon. My wife and I went to Gotham Bagels on a Saturday right around noon. It was right off of the square so we anticipated a long line but we were able to put our order right away, there was virtually no line. They finished making our food within 5-7 minutes which was a nice plus. My wife and I split the Cold Italian (prosciutto, mortadella, salami, provolone and giardineria. Even though we split the bagel/sandwich, we both felt like it was plenty of food. I would have definitely been able to eat the whole thing myself though. The price was fine, I think we paid $9.50ish for this, but that provided us both with lunch, so no complaints. Seeing as its a bagel, some might expect it to be convenient to take and walk and, at least in the case of the Cold Italian, this was NOT the case. It's quite messy (in a wonderful way) and I'd suggest staying and eating there. They have adequate seating at least on Saturday. They also offered hand-squeezed juices, but at $3.00 for about a 12 oz glass, we decided to skip that this time."}
{"text":"This place had the worst service. The lady working the register was very unapologetic about not having half the things on their menu. On top of that, she claimed they didn't give orders to go. Maybe she didn't see all the containers behind her. Hey Gotham, maybe consider hiring someone that understands people."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Waited for 45 minutes for our order while everyone in our group finished their bagels. Got yelled at for asking what happened to our order.  Turns out they screwed up. Who cares if the bagels are halfway decent when you're treated like that."}
{"text":"As much as I love the food at this joint, they have coffee shop syndrome: the service is slow and rude, and many of the employees are way too cool for many of the customers. Every time I've been here it's one problem or another; which is a shame, because I could eat the pumpernickel with scallion cream cheese, everyday. I realize that they're busy at times, but waiting 20 minutes for a bagel with cream cheese is ridiculous, then slowly realizing they forgot to make your order and only to be told they'e out of bagels... at 12:30pm, when they close at 3:00pm? No, I don't want to wait another 10 minutes for a bagel, I'll walk down to Pinkus McBride and get a delicious sandwich. At least they aren't rudely calling out my order and then getting pissed off when it takes me over 20 seconds to get up to the counter. The only thing they could learn from coffee shops, is that they should give \"our service sucked today, your next bagel is on us\" coupons."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than one star I would. After waiting over 40 minutes for a turkey sandwich, the owner handed me my bagel with a very snarky comment and said \"could you get any more items on your sandwich?\" The people behind me in line asked him where their sandwiches were and he said they were 8th in line and refused to make their bagels next. Unbelievably rude, condescending and inappropriate. I will never come back and will make sure everyone I know won't come back either."}
{"text":"Gotham makes decent bagels (I'm from New York, so I'm comparing them to their namesake), but the service (over the past three years that I've lived down the street) has gone from very good to awful.   If you can wait 15-20 minutes for your bagel or sandwich because everyone behind the counter forgets to work, then this is an okay place to go. Also, don't order an egg sandwich unless you like your eggs very, very runny. Undercooked, even."}
{"text":"Best bagel since I left New Jersey- it even comes with the east coast attitude. Every time I go there I feel like I'm bothering the person taking my order. (I've actually been yelled at by the owner before for not speaking loud enough). I guess it's worth the abuse to get my bagel fix."}
{"text":"Gotham bagels, in my opinion, has some of the best bagels in Madison. However, they are pricey, to the point that I think they are overpriced for what it is...a BAGEL. Their breakfast sandwiches are really good. I have never tried their cream cheese because I'm not a fan, so I can' t comment on that. I always call ahead because it can take longer than I am willing to wait if you just walk in and order."}
{"text":"Great coffee and bagels. The eggplant Parmesan is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I raved about this place when it first opened. I came with my parents one blustery April morning and got a toasted super egg everything bagel with cream cheese and boy was I hooked. I kept dragging the boy here, weekend after weekend.. but something's happened! The coffee is terrible, the bagels have become smaller, harder, and less toasted! I don't know if this is a consequence of getting more business (I'm glad to see this place packed, because I love me some carbs in the morning), but please go back to your old ways Gotham!! The cinnamon raisin bagels with sultanas made me a convert to the cinnamon raisin clan! Also, the cream cheese is housemade! So yummy. Please turn up the heat on your toaster so that it gets all melty on my bagel again."}
{"text":"best bagels in Madison. Service is hit or miss"}
{"text":"Stiffed w/\"Raw Deal.\" They used to be good, uncertain what happened.  Last purchase was inedible; done on the outside/raw dough in the middle. I dared email them about it & received a back-handed apology / lecture. May only be chump change to them, hope selling me a \"raw deal\" was worth losing a good customer over. No intention of purchasing anything from them in the future.  Was made aware they never set out to make \"every\" bagel perfect & that human error was bound to show up at some point in time (eloquently informed). No longer a Gotham Bagel customer.  Moving on to the land of GREAT BAGELS at Brueggers, Einstein, etc.... Should have stuck with them to begin with, as they're tried, trusted & tasty."}
{"text":"Really tasty, really large bagels. Stopped in for lunch with two other people. We each got a cup of soup and a bagel. The spicy tomato soup did have nice heat and the egg bagel was rich and chewy, just like I hoped. While there is seating, it's not especially welcoming, save for two upholstered chairs. I'd stick to takeout."}
{"text":"Bagels are tasty, and the spreads are good but the  service is slow and the portions are inconsistent. I'm not a hater, in fact I like Gotham, but lately they are slipping."}
{"text":"Best bagels in Madison are a great basis for their breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Got the lox and cream cheese on a bagel this weekend. The bagel itself was quite good and the service was just fine. Now I've become pretty used to paying 6-7 dollars for a lox sandwich, but was dismayed to find that at Gotham the $6.75 price tag included just lox, cream cheese and the bagel. Who eats that? To add on my requisite tomatoes, onions and capers I ended up paying 9 dollars. And to add insult to my wallet's injury, I got home to find spinach on the bagel instead of onions and the spinach was old and gross. I'll go back for  bagels, but get my lox and fixings fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very good food, had lunch there and it was very yummy. Kids loved the breakfast bagels egg sandwich."}
{"text":"Bagels and sandwiches were excellent.  I am still dreaming about the Brighten Beach!  Coffee was so-so."}
{"text":"These are (usually) the best bagels in Madison.  There has been a couple of times where the bagels don't seem as good as usual- don't know if they're old or what.  The owner and staff usually are disgruntled and a bit rude.  I'm originally from NYC so I don't mind this if it means getting some tasty bagels but I know this can be a turnoff for some Midwesterners."}
{"text":"Best bagels I have had in a long time.  The super egg is a must have with scallion.  Coffee is good, but it tends to be hit or miss with the service.  A couple of occassions  there has been grounds in the coffee, which I can deal with.  But not the snarky attitude I get when I tell them there is grinds in the coffee."}
{"text":"I really wish I could get good bagels in this town but really I feel like Einstein continues to be best for the price. Bagels forever is ok too. I live right around the corner from here and as a bagel addict I thought I had hit the jackpot but no dice. Rather, these bagels are a little too dense for me so they're chewy but don't have the right fluff. Also, this makes toasting them result it a stone-like circular object. They are decently seasoned.   Where it goes downhill is the price/lox cream cheese. Their lox cream cheese is basically this pinkish brown tasteless muck. It adds nothing which is sad because I love lox cream cheese when I don't feel like shelling out a ton of money for the real deal. So my favorite bagel in the world (Poppyseed with lox spread, onions, and capers) does not hit the spot at all. Instead, I find myself having trouble finishing it.   None of the other things I have tried have been better than a 3 and they're all at least 9 dollars. The salads look good but I have yet to try them because I only go when I have a bagel craving. I also had this meat and barley soup one time and it was the fattiest soup I have ever had in my life. Blech.  I'm going to go again and hope for the best by just ordering plain cream cheese and maybe something in the glass showcase but it pisses me off I can't even go to a bagel place and be satisfied with what I would actually want.   Also, I realize bagel chips are a good way to deal with old bagels but who the hell gives bagel chips as a side with a bagel??"}
{"text":"get the OMFG special. Has a slight kick to it, but you won't regret it. You can't go wrong with any of their breakfast sandwhiches."}
{"text":"Ugh, I really wanted to keep liking this place but I feel the quality has really gone downhill since they first opened.  No longer as yeasty and chewy as I remember.  To add to the annoyance, on my last 3 visits they were out of their everything bagels.  Really? and it was hours before closing time, that's just not acceptable.  That and waiting 15 minutes for 3 bagels w/ cream cheese.  I've noticed the owner dude wasn't behind the counter at these visits so maybe he needs to take the reins again.  I guess I'll just wait for my next visit to NYC for a decent bagel experience again."}
{"text":"Gotham Bagels did finally get back to me, after we wrote a long letter with our complaints. The owner called me back and told me he'd left me a voice-mail (which I never got), that they'd fired the terrible employee, and that he'd give me a gift certificate to try to make up for my bad experience. So. At least they tried to remedy the situation."}
{"text":"I normally love Gotham bagels. Whenever I go to the Saturday farmer's market, I stop here on my way out to get a super egg everything bagel with jalapeno garlic cream cheese. It's the most delicious treat. So today, I was with my kids and my mom at the Wednesday market and they wanted to go get bagels. When my friend found out we were going she requested that I pick some up for her too. All of us love the super egg everything flavor best. When I went up to order I asked for a dozen super egg everything bagels. The man (manager? same guy who almost always takes my order) said no. I asked why. He said there's only a max of four of any one type of bagel. (Why??) I explained I was getting some for two different families and we all love that flavor best, so if I got two dozen packs could I get more than four of the one kind we all wanted?? He said no and then walked away. A different woman started gathering the bagels for me. Then the guy came back and said, \"I shouldn't even let you have a dozen bagels. You can only have a dozen bagels if you call the night before.\" Why in the world would this be their policy? I used to work at Panera and just about every single person that comes in orders a dozen at a time. Is he telling me that seriously nobody comes in the day of and wants a dozen bagels?? He was incredibly rude throughout the entire transaction. After I got my food (filled with a lot of bagel flavors I didn't really want), my mom went up a second time and ordered more super egg everything bagels for me. The man then told her that he sees how we work, trying to cheat the system. It was so rude to paying customers that wanted to buy a lot of bagels and cream cheese. We were the only people in the restaurant at the time. It was around 11:00, well past their morning rush. I looked at the menu and boards on the wall and later on the website and nowhere did it say you could only get four of one flavor. And though a dozen bagels was only listed on their catering menu, I find it very hard to believe that it's super uncommon that people would want a dozen at a time. My kids were later talking about how mean the man was to me and my mom and I were greatly disappointed in our service. Despite how much I love that bagel and cream cheese, I definitely do not plan on going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I don't really care about the price of bagels in NYC or anyone else, as far as Madison goes Gotham has the absolute best bagels around.  Hand rolled, plenty of \"toppings.\"  Forget Einstein, support your local bagel company."}
{"text":"I lived in New York for 7 years and ate a lot of bagels, and I have to say this bagel is as good as it gets. Gotham rivals, if not beats, any bagel I've ever had in New York and I can't believe I was lucky enough to find this place here in Madison when I came to Wisconsin. I stock up on bagels as much as I can whenever I visit to bring them back Milwaukee.  I have visited the Park Street location a few times and I have spoken with the owner more than once. He has always seemed amiable and eager to talk to me about New York and whatnot. I see people on here complain about the rude service but I have to say, I haven't really experienced that. Sometimes the conversation at the register is a bit more terse than maybe people in Wisconsin are used to, but I have never found it to be flat out rude. I'll be back to Gotham for sure."}
{"text":"it is pretty easy to assign a rating to a place like this. you're in madison and looking for a new york style bagel. there are no other places that do a NYC bagel, and this one does them quite well, so I like it.  the staff is pretty friendly (went out of my way to help me with a small request the other day). I haven't tried the other things on the menu, so i can't vouch, though things looked pretty good.  what i can say, however, is that they do NYC bagels right (and much much better than the crap einstetins puts out...), which is good"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where all of the reviews (both positive and negative) are all completely accurate. Several things are true at the same time.  1. Their food is wonderful. 2. They are impossibly, inexplicably, slow to make an order. 3. The staff is...brusque. Not rude per se, but definitely not Midwestern nice. 4. There is a way better than average chance that they will lose your order, become defensive if you inquire about it and refuse to check on it, and then blame you for not asking about it sooner. 5. But again, their food is wonderful.  I have decided that it's worth stopping in once or twice a year for a truly excellent bagel, but points 2-4 keep me from going in more often."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. And I used to really love this place, but the atmosphere and service have changed since they first opened. From now on I'll only go if I have 30+ minutes to wait for a cold sandwich (to go). Also, everything just feels very tense. There have been some really cool people working here, but over the years all employees seem to be increasingly stressed."}
{"text":"Love the flavor, dripping bagel mess, and energy. This place was totally buzzing with people in a happy frenzy to get what they clearly already knew would be incredible one Saturday afternoon. (Embarrassingly) this Madisonian had never been to Gotham but had an inkling what I was missing. I'd attempted visits in the past, but learned upon arrival they closed early in the day. So happy to learn they also have a location in Sun Prairie.  Staff moved quickly. Water was free and cold on a hot day; other beverages were expensive but looked fresh. Bathroom required a key; restaurant in general could've used a cleaning but after 5 hours of fast-paced service, it was understandable.  Areas for improvement - Additional seating; those around us were standing but we got a seat quickly. Prices are a little steep at 8 or 9+ for a bagel sandwich a la carte. Longer hours; I would actually love this late at night and in the early morning the most."}
{"text":"This place would get chewed up alive in New York City. Their bagels taste like they are from Wisconsin. All due respect to Wisconsin but the state is known for great cheese and not Bagels.  We ordered a couple of dozen sliced bagels and they came unsliced and the cream cheese and butter were frozen.  All of the above and their NYC like pricing makes this place not worth it.  We recommend you go elsewhere in town."}
{"text":"Bagels are awesome, the service is personable and fast. Tried the Double G on Salt and it was so good I came back the next day for a regular bacon egg and cheese. Best bast bagels in Madison"}
{"text":"Gotham has become an institution to me the last few years, serving authentic NYC style bagels that are top quality.  Simply put, the best bagels in the Midwest.  The bagels and spreads are always fresh and made right at Gotham.  I've been cycling through combinations to try everything they offer.  I've come to the conclusion that it doesn't matter what you order, as everything is outstanding.  I usually get two bagels; one for breakfast and one for the road - known as the pocket bagel.  Gotham is also a deli and has some awesome items in the case.  The freshly squeezed juice is a perfect revitalizer on post-Badger game Sunday mornings.  Also, Gotham serves Alterra coffee, which is amazing in itself.  Come early and come often!"}
{"text":"The best bagels and breakfast sandwiches! Their homemade cream cheese is amazing. Can't wait for the sun prairie location to open."}
{"text":"Favorite bagel place in Madison because they have hands down the best bagel sandwiches in town. They do a fine bagel with cream cheese but I think where Gotham shines is definitely with their hefty sandwich creations.   My go to is the pastrami and egg on whole wheat honey (helps cut the saltiness of the pastrami). Yummy gooey breakfast goodness. I also tried their Montauk lobster bagel sandwich during Sustainable Seafood Week and that was refreshingly delicious. Love that they participate in Madison food weeks. Expect lines if you come during the weekends and food can be a little slow coming out sometime but if you're craving a bagel, it's all worth it."}
{"text":"Gotham Bagels - an eclectic bagel bakery  with flavor options ranging from plain to everything, and ornate cream cheese options to accompany any palette. I was intrigued by the gochujang cream cheese but stuck with my go-to bagel favorite...lox and cream, defined as a Brighton Beach. The salmon was plentiful, accompanied with red onions, tomatoes, a lively spring mix, scallions, caper cream cheese and I opted for the everything bagel. Lovely. I wish I had tried The Alaskan, with seared salmon, scallions, gochujang cream cheese, salad mix and cucumbers. But I stuck with my lox and cream. Little minor regret there.   My dining partner got the Spicy Italian sausage, egg and cheddar cheese...titled the Spicy Italian Sausage, egg and cheese bagel  ona plain bagel. The egg was runny, my favorite but not so much his; he still ate it. I tried it, sausage was definitely spicy but was a VERY good sammich. I would come back for that one as well.   As I sat there, long lines the entire time. This is a little bagel gem-heaven! The ambiance reminds me of Katz in Manhattan, I could sit and people-watch all day. Employees behind the bagel bar are witty and sarcastic...I  it. I could people-watch them, too and there's a bagel bar to do that at!"}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker (Long Island to be exact), I can say these are the best bagels I've ever had outside of NYC or the island.   There seem to be a lot of haters on here who are too sensitive to the NY attitudes of Gotham staffers. Get over it! Life is too short. Chalk it up as part of Gotham's charm and enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Right on their menu it states \"15 dollar minimum delivery to capital square, 20 dollar minimum to campus\".   That's great, if they were willing to fricking deliver.   I called once at 8:00, he said they were short staffed and couldn't deliver, and that he had someone coming in at 9:30 to make a big delivery, and they would be able to take care of it then. That's fine, I understand, and I tell him I'll call back later.   Fast-forward to 9:15, I call back. After overhearing a 5 minute conversation with his whining complaining driver about not wanting to make the delivery, he comes back to the phone and tells me that his other delivery canceled and he just didn't have the extra staff to make the delivery.   Now trust me, the pregnant lady stuck at work without her wallet who's been excited about bagels for 2 hours is pretty pissed.  Learn how to run a business and please your customers, sir, and if you aren't going to deliver... Take it off your damn menu."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand any person who wouldn't give this place less than four stars. I have  lived my entire life out east, have spent enormous amounts of time in NYC for work, and can say that Gotham bagels come pretty darn close to the real NYC thing! It's not in the tap water that makes a NYC bagel (that plays a fairly minor role), it's (mostly) the act of boiling it before it's put in the oven. It makes the bagels crisp on the outside but soft on the inside. *Anybody who tells you otherwise has clearly never been to the city.* In any event, the bagels here are just that. Soft interior with a more crisp exterior. I always get the whole wheat one which has a great flavor too.  Another thing that deeply confuses me about all the this Gotham hate is that I'm also definitely not the only one who loves these. I work at the Capitol and every time we have a major success, we get breakfast sandwiches at Gotham (which everyone is happy about). The only reason I'm giving Gotham four stars instead of five is because the service, as it has been mentioned, is very slow. It took about 15 minutes to make my sandwich which would have taken me about 5 if I had the bagel already made"}
{"text":"Having lived in Madison for many years, I somehow have never stopped into Gotham before. I went this morning and am very upset that I never went sooner.   Reading other reviews I didn't expect to be wowed. The \"G\" bagel sandwich was INCREDIBLE. The capicola and special cream cheese combine for a zesty kick. I would call it flavorful, not spicy. But I love spicy foods.   Coffee was excellent as well (Collectivo). Little pricey to make it a place I will frequent (sandwich and bagel were $7), but it was the perfect Friday morning treat. I will be back."}
{"text":"I love the bagels here. They are the only place that has tofu \"cream cheese\", but I've gotten my order messed up so many times. How hard is it to toast a bagel, when you ask for it? I didn't think it was that difficult. Just because I'm ordering an all veggie bagel does not mean it shouldn't be toasted, when I CLEARLY specify for it to be toasted.  No point in walking 3 blocks to get a new bagel. Disappointing service. Food is still good."}
{"text":"God d*mn! What great bagels and bagel sandwiches.   Multiple flavors of vegan cream cheese? Yup.   Lots of veggies? Yup.   Fast friendly service? Yup.   I was so amazing by how fast the bagel was finished especially because of how packed the place was.   I really loved being able to see all of the options of bagels and see how fresh they were.   I ordered the original v which was vegan and it was so tasty. It was loaded with cream cheese and veggies. I ordered it on a sesame bagel and man was it so good.   I would definitely return to have the same sand which or create my own. But I have to admit I was really satisfied with the original v.   If you're a vegan you've gotta try it, or if you're not a vegan, you've still gotta try it."}
{"text":"Went in there expecting badass pictures of batman and joker plastered all over the walls, but was disappointed to find it New York themed. Lame...  Anyways, the bagels are fresh and just crispy enough to get a crunch out of it. I love their onion and everything bagels. They also have a ton of smear to try, with several tasty specials.   It's a bit on the expensive side when it comes to bagels, but at least you're getting New York quality bagels eh?"}
{"text":"I love bagels, so I'd been looking forward to trying Gotham Bagels. We stopped in around 9:00 am Friday morning. It was very hot inside the restaurant. There were lots of people sitting at tables but the line was not particularly long. The menu was on a table next to the cashier where you order, so you don't have much time to think about what you want until you get there. I'd definitely recommend getting the menu up above the cashier so you can plan in advance. We just ordered a couple of bagels with salmon cream cheese. The price was quite reasonable. Then we sat down towards the back of the restaurant to wait.  While looking around I began to notice that almost no-one sitting at the tables actually had their food. They were all waiting. We sat there sweating in the heat while they slowly called out orders and patrons went to pick up their food. It was literally 23 minutes after we ordered before we had our bagels with cream cheese. I'm glad they have their ordering system down, but I would actually have preferred to see a line so that I knew how long it was going to take. If I saw the line, I would know and could make the decision if I wanted to wait. With this approach I just sat there seething and sweating the longer it took. 23 minutes is a long time for a bagel with cream cheese -- especially when there is no line.    When we finally got our bagels we took them outside and ate on the square. The bagels themselves were delicious. Soft and chewy. The salmon cream cheese was also delicious. Gotham Bagels definitely knows how to make a good bagel, they just need to get the rest of their act together."}
{"text":"I love their bagels and their atmosphere. A fresh from the oven everything bagel with melted cream cheese and lox is heaven."}
{"text":"I've been eating Gotham Bagels for a while now, and while they probably won't win awards for \"Most Congenial Staff\" I certainly don't think they go out of their way to be rude. Their bagels are pretty darn good, and as a former bagel baker myself, (yes, as in making the dough, forming the bagels, and baking them at 4:30 AM,) I can tell you, there are far worse bagels to be had. These are just dense enough, not bricks, nor angel food consistency, quite a feat. If you want standard, \"fast service\" and cheap prices, I recommend Einstein Brothers. If you want something that tastes good, made by local folks, and maybe a few quirks, then go to Gotham. I certainly will continue my patronage."}
{"text":"I've never been emotional over Bagels before, but I got emotional over these. Absolutely beautiful, chewy, golden and amazing. I tried the Arugula and Salmon which was delicious and their Pumpernickel pastrami was to die for. Highly recommend! $1 for a plain bagel? Worth going to Wisconsin for."}
{"text":"When I first came to Madison from New York City, where I grew up, I found myself missing many things - but I missed nothing so much as delicious New York bagels. Madison's a great town, I thought, but damn do I miss those bagels...  Until I found this place.  I never thought I'd say it, but I really can't tell the difference between these bagels and the ones from my favorite spot in NYC. They're just superb.  Lox and cream cheese on poppy with a tomato is the best if you want the true New York experience (make sure you ask for that tomato!), but you really can't go wrong whatever you choose.   Also, they serve the bagels with a really delicious pickle and some bagel chips. Beautiful. Oh, and they have amazing fresh-squeezed orange juice, and their espresso is surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"Gotham bagels are simply the best in Madison and closest thing to NYC bagels. They are hand-rolled and topped with artisanal cream cheese that ranges from plain to even Gochugang flavored. The cheese is really tangy and fresh. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located just a couple blocks from the capitol building, Gotham Bagels prides itself on authentic, hand-rolled, New York-style bagels.  Looking for something healthy yet substantial, I ordered the \"V\" breakfast sandwich ($4.75), described as \"scallion tofu, roasted poblano peppers, tomato, arugula, and avocado on a bagel.\"  I ordered it on my usual bagel of choice, the everything, only to be told that they were all out of everything bagels.  Just as I thought my dreams had been crushed, the cashier informed me that they did, however, have \"Super Egg Everything\" bagels.  When I asked what that was, I was told that it was an egg bagel, with all the toppings, PLUS toppings inside the bagel.  So simple, but brilliant, and it was the first I'd seen it.  Enthusiasm restored, I ordered the V on a Super Egg Everything and took a seat.  The bagel came out right away, and was served up with a side of two fresh bagel chips.  (Again, such an obvious thing to do, but I've never seen it before!).  The bagel was chewy, but not puffy, just the way I like them.  As for the toppings, I assume that I lost several readers with the words \"scallion tofu\" where \"cream cheese\" should rightfully be.  I was skeptical too, but let me tell you, this cream cheese lover was sold.  It was deliciously creamy, somehow cheesy, and I doubt I would have ever noticed had I not known that it wasn't cream cheese.  And if it's a little healthier for me, I'll take it.  The roasted poblanos are another ingredient that you don't often see at your average bagel shop, but they were delicious, adding just the right amount of heat to wake you up in the morning.  The avocado was mashed guac-style, which is preferable in my opinion, and the veggies added a nice freshness.  All-in-all, one of the better bagel sandwiches I can recall.

{"text":"I tried the wheat bagel with an egg on it.  It was very plain. The bagel was okay but it really just tasted like putting an egg on a piece of bread. I wouldn't pay $4 for that. Since I'm a vegetarian, most of the sandwich items were not eatable.   I was excited they had three flavors of vegan tofu cream cheese; I got on the veggie flavor on the side. Unfortunately it was extremely flavorless. Next time I would sprinkle salt and pepper on it myself. The consistency was good though.   I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but it was A-OK."}
{"text":"The line was fairly long but moved REALLY slow then took quite some time to get them. I wouldn't consider it worth the wait. The bagel sandwiches were toasted to the point of burnt as was the bacon."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure Gotham Bagels is the best bagel cafe in the area.   Their signature bagel sandwiches are mouthwatering. I only wished they had more options. I love the Spanish Harlem with the pork shoulder. Absolutely delicious. Their bagels are always fresh and the meats they have available are great for building your own bagel. What's clutch at Gotham Bagels is the variety of spreads they offer. If you're not in the mood for meat bagels, spreads are always a great alternative. Ordering in bulk is also pretty reasonably priced here.   Beware. There is this one girl (I'm not sure if she still works there) that always seems to be sassy and cranky..."}
{"text":"I had completely forgotten this place existed until my friend suggested going there for MACN Week. Now I'll try and forget it all over again. I threw half of my bagel sandwich in the trash, it was so bad.  First of all, I must confess that I'm not a fan of bagel sandwiches. I just don't understand the concept. Making a sandwich harder to eat, that's the idea? Um, okay. I'm simply a fan of regular ole bread. Biting into a bagel sandwich is difficult and messy and simply not that fun. Bagels are perfectly fine when toasted and smeared with cream cheese or butter, but not for sandwiches.  So anyway, my MACN Week special bagel sandwich was something called Chomolunga and it was terrible. The tandoori chicken was only warm and very chewy and generally unpleasant. The bagel was slathered in this artichoke/ricotta/chickpea/god knows what else mixture. The slop that was slathered on my sandwich was cold, and my chicken was somewhat warm. It's odd to have a sandwich that's both hot and cold. The flavors were not good and didn't mesh well. This sandwich was impossible to eat on so many levels. Yuck.  My companion ordered a bagel sandwich with an egg, cheese and whatnot on it, and she seemed to like hers fine. Her spicy pineapple-orange juice was disgusting, though.  A woman came up to the counter while we were ordering to point out her sandwich was made incorrectly. The staff wasn't very apologetic.  In fact, all the people behind that counter seemed disgruntled and lacking in customer service skills.  Also, how are you supposed to know where to pick up your sandwich? There are people yelling out names in the kitchen area and sometimes the cashier will yell out your name. Confusing. And I reckon when it's busy, it's difficult to hear them call your name. There are better setups at just about every other restaurant in this city.  Also, the place was pretty dirty. Get those tables wiped off more promptly, folks. No one likes a sticky table full of crumbs.   I did enjoy the pickle spear that came with my meal. It was strong and salty and made me wince. Delicious. If not for this delicious pickle, I'd probably be giving this place one lonely star.  All of my prior unpleasant visits came rushing back to me after today. I would not recommend this place, and I won't be back again."}
{"text":"Yummy bagel but AWFUL service. I ordered an untoasted bagel w cream cheese to go (at most places this is usually a no wait order).  I watched one girl making very long orders while the rest of the staff was ??? Doing random things. Prepping tomatoes and taking bites of them in between (gross) and chatting.  Ugh. Not going back."}
{"text":"Bagels are good but service is horrible. When you ask them to toast your bagels there's about a 50% hit rate. Just waited 30 minutes for a bagel and cream cheese."}
{"text":"Was very excited to try Gotham Bagels located near the capital in Madison.  They claim the bagels are the closest thing to NY bagels.  I would say that's pretty accurate for Madison.  Everything we had was good from the egg salad to the turkey sandwich.  Our favorite was the Farve and I highly recommend that.  Make sure you ask for generous portions because we felt skimped on the whitefish salad. Great for a quick breakfast or lunch.  We will be back but my expectations won't be as high."}
{"text":"Pretty good bagels for the midwest. Way better than any of the crap that is called \"bagel\" in Chicago. I like the cream cheeses, the bagel selection is good, and overall, this place makes me a happy New Yorker every time I visit."}
{"text":"this place i think because of them being so busy they are lacking in other areas like what comes with a C.A.B i clearly told the girl i want two c.a.b with no tomatoes. not only after going home did i realize there's no tomatoes there's also one with no avacado. kind of disappointment because i come from the other side of town. to see the girl just forget to put avacado on one bagel and not the other. call it ocd but stuff like this bothers me"}
{"text":"This is the premier bagel shop in Madison. The bagels are excellent with great texture and freshness. They have a great variety of cream cheeses that compliment the bagels perfectly. The service is great and they also have an great sandwich selection. I'm definitely a repeat customer and highly recommend Gotham!"}
{"text":"Moved to Madison 2 years ago and have not been to the deli until today.  Outstanding sandwich with quality meat & cheese on a NY style bagel!  Good for breakfast and lunch near the Capital."}
{"text":"By far, the best bagels in Madison.  The outside is crisp, the inside is chewy, just like a bagel is supposed to be.  I buy a dozen at a time and freeze them, just to have them on hand when the craving strikes."}
{"text":"if you don't love gotham you might be a cylon. since being introduced I eat a bagel sandwich 1+ times a week. as a person who \"doesn't like sandwiches\" this is a big deal. love the veggie on super egg everything, but they also have a rotating menu of specials that are usually fantastic. eat here and you will never go out for brunch again."}
{"text":"Lox lox lox! Can't get enough of it! My only complaint is that it's a bit pricy for bagels but I'd still come back for them despite that, especially because the bagels are hand-rolled. I got a sesame bagel with lox and scallion cream cheese. It was the perfect combo. They definitely weren't shy about the lox either which made me really happy. They have some unique bagel combos like one with pastrami which I hope to try next time when I'm in town. Hey have vegan options too for you vegan lovers, definitely not for me though Ha. If you want a simple bagel with cream cheese, they've got your classic bagel flavors along with a list of unique or classic cream cheese so there's ought to be one that you'll like. The location is great - right on the capitol square and the ambience is young and hip with lots of university students."}
{"text":"We LOVE Gotham, not just because we are Dark Knight nerds...ahem...fans. Yes, sometimes the parking is difficult, and seating is full, and you need to ask for a bathroom key, but totally worth the extra hassle. The bagels are big, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, with great, not too much spread. Our \"go to\" order is to split a chicken breast bagel sandwich and a sweet type bagel with cream cheese. The chicken is absolutely succulent, cooked perfectly, never dry. We take our out of town guests here for breakfast before walking the farmers Market. A hit with them has been the Pastrami. We love the details they put into their items such as the rosemary infused cranberry juice - items you just can't get anywhere."}
{"text":"The consensus within the Jewish org I work for is that Gotham is the only place to get a New York bagel in these parts. Everything is DELICIOUS. Fun and well thought out menu with great combos of things. I love their lavender cranberry drink. GREAT coffee. Pretty crowded at all times, for good reason, so prepare to wait a little for your food. WORTH IT."}
{"text":"Gotham has the best bagels in madison. The super egg everything is incredible. Their bagel sandwiches are awesome, especially the daily specials. The bagels are definitely pricey, but worth it!   People seem to complain about the service, but it's definitely the kind of service (if not better) than you'd receive in the NYC area. I like that you can sit and eat the bagel there. And sometimes you get a surprise pickle with your order!"}
{"text":"Good bagels for Midwest. Coming from New York this bagel place was nothing special but it is probably the best you're going to get around Madison. Long lines but they move quickly. Big selection of cream cheeses and offers sandwiches as well.  Atmosphere- 6/10 Quality- 6/10 Creativity- 7/10 -A&R"}
{"text":"These are the best NYC style bagels outside of NY! The brighton beach is my absolute favorite- a super egg everything bagel with caper cream cheese, crunchy cucumbers, red onions and tomatoes, with salmon lox they make especially in store! They never charge me when I ask for extra lox either. Great guys here and great bagels!!"}
{"text":"It is a known fact that the best bagels in the world come from New York City. Gotham is straight out of NYC, it's no wonder they serve the best bagels, hands down, in all of Madison. Pretty authentic NYC rude service comes with it too. But it's worth it, because the food is amazing.   To people who complain about them having a lack of bagel or cream cheese varieties because they \"run-out\": That's because they cook the bagels fresh everyday, no exceptions. They run out because everyone wants them!!! Stop whining and get to Gotham early."}
{"text":"Dropping them to one star after receiving this message from the owner:  \"You should be arrested for your food photos. I can show you how to properly cut, sear, and present food. After you bail me out for making bialys, I want to teach you how to properly sear a scallop. You called me out? I accept. Walk the talk brother man. You can't cook to save your life, don't worry about the bialys.\"  The bagels were solid, but this owner is clearly quite the dick. I may have moved away from Madison, but there's no way I'd recommend anyone going back and supporting this business. Certainly not with attitude.  Oh, and fyi: The bialys suck. They aren't bialys, and they certainly don't taste like them.  To the owner, I respond with this: anyone can sear a scallop, including me. Why would I ever want you to show me? You and your staff can't even make a sandwich correctly."}
{"text":"As previous reviews have written--yes there are flies, yes the service is embarrassingly rude and slow. I'd also point out that the sandwiches are expensive for the size of the serving, especially considering that they're in a neighborhood with several places to get great lunchfood. All that said, they have by far the single best bagel and cream cheese in the area. Indeed, they'd probably be well-regarded as a bagel maker in most small and medium sized cities. So do stop by and get a fresh bagel (but not a sandwich) for a reasonable price, though you'll probably have to wait a half hour to get your food while they're watching TV."}
{"text":"Great bagels and a nice spread of Sandwiches. Really a nice place to visit for breakfast and a great location near the Capital building. Also a great place to pickup some bagels and take home for breakfast with the family."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and I've been living here for 4 years and I can assure you that it's THE ONLY PLACE IN MADISON TO GET QUALITY BAGELS!! The staff is all so friendly and the service is quick."}
{"text":"Was in Madison over the weekend and stopped for a bagel breakfast Sunday morning.  Enjoyed a cinnamon raisin bagel and a breakfast sandwich.  Both were outstanding.  Bagels were super fresh and the sandwich was made to order.  If you're downtown and want a quick, tasty bite, give Gotham Bagels a try."}
{"text":"As one of those annoying \"New York transplants\" who somehow ended up far, far from my ancestral homeland, I always find myself nursing a serious jones for two things more than anything else: a halfway-f*ckn' decent slice of pizza (for the love of God, how hard is it!?), and bagels. Luckily, Gotham Bagels was there to satiate my every bagel craving. The bagels are pretty legit. The signature sandwiches are excellent and thoughtfully prepared; I recommend the salmon-centered \"Brighton Beach,\" although the pastrami is excellent as well. Great coffee as well. The owner is a native New Yorker and a colorful, charismatic guy who's always joking around with the customers. Great place; definitely a staple of my Madtown experience, and a place I'll return to when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Big fan. New York style bagels done well. Great breakfast sandwich options. Coffee leaves something to be desired but no complaints otherwise. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels and sandwiches, great coffee. The only thing that turns me off about this place is that it always seems to be so crowded. So if you can manage to get there during an off time, it's very nice.  Also just noticed recently that you can buy fresh Gotham bagels from Woodman's. Love!"}
{"text":"Absolute best bagel place in Madison. My favorite is the eggplant Parmesan special. Just heavenly. Other favorite are the lox and bagel and the long guy land. Bagel chips are a plus!! Miss this when I think back to living in Madison"}
{"text":"What I would do for a Gotham bagel on a hungover Saturday morning right now...   This was a staple for most people who came to UW-Madison from out of state. While it is kind of pricey, it is worth every penny!  The bagels are fantastic. My favorite sandwich is the Eggplant Parm special. My friends love the long-guy land. A regular bagel and cream cheese also cannot be beat.  The service is so/so. The lines are long, and I have definitely had some off experiences, but I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I've spent a bunch of time in NYC and tried quite a few bagel shops in Manhattan and Brooklyn.   Gotham in Madison definitely holds their own.  The texture and chewiness are right on.  My mouth is watering right now thinking about my last Gotham sandwich - Spanish Harlem on Super Egg.  The contrast and balance of smoky pulled pork, tart pickle, tangy mustard, creamy swiss, and salty capocollo inside the crispy/chewy bagel rocked my world.  Best of all, the tender pulled pork has all the crunchy burnt bits and spice rub you find in authentic southern BBQ.  Mmmm....  Keep up the good work Gotham!!!  note:  this review pertains to the new Park Street store."}
{"text":"As a person who cooks and travels for a living, I absolutely love getting to visit the best restaurants and markets in new cities and documenting my trip to share with friends, family's, and other hungry travelers. While the bagels were great, the asshole who yelled at me for taking photographs (which were meant to write a positive post) ruined it. Not only was it unprofessional (13+ years in the hospitality industry, I'd never be disrespectful to a paying customer), but had I not already paid for my order, I would have absolutely walked out. I don't care how good your food is, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone excited to try and share a new experience and subject them to a verbal attack from the miserable f*ck... pretty sure his Name is Joe, and I think he even owns the place."}
{"text":"Gotham seriously serves the best bagels outside of NY. I'd even say they're better than some bagel places on Long Island.  These are real bagels, not the nonsense you get at the bagel chains (Einstein, Panera, Etc.).  They are hard on the outside and chewy on the inside, exactly what a bagel should be.  They don't come in blueberry, chocolate chip, or sunflower flavors.  So, why only 4 stars and not 5?  Well, not only are their bagels authentic NY style, but so are their employee's dispositions: surly.  You won't find any smiles here."}
{"text":"I'm a new fan! They have a good seating area, the bagels are good and the sandwich options are awesome. I've never seen bagels so masterfully packed with ingredients before. Despite being so stuffed, the bagels are easy to eat... That's something to be praised! Also, it's worth mentioning that their pastrami is so bomb that they even have a neon sign for it. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with service here, they are always very attentive & quick.  Maybe they've read all the angry yelp reviews and upped their game?  Atmosphere is fun- you can see the kitchen (with their... bagel machine? I'm assuming that's what that large loud thing is. Whatever it is, it's pretty cool) and there are family photos, photos of NY, and various newspaper features framed up on the wall.   Their bagels are the best, their smears are great. At most places I don't order the same thing twice; but here I stick with the everything bagel with Feta-licious smear. It's that good. Good bagel, good smear, needs nothing else.   They serve Collectivo coffee, and serve it well.   Warning! They have a 4.50 (I think) minimum on credit card purchases!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced. It was very confusing where you were supposed to wait for your order. Names were called out so softly, no one came up for their orders. After 30 minutes, I asked someone if I had missed my name being called. Very rudely she said no. I asked someone else 10 minutes later and she said my order was next. She handed me the wrong order. After 5 minutes of flagging her back down, she told me oops, my bagel had been sitting in a bag behind the counter for twenty minutes. By that time is was cold.   Very disappointed in my visit."}
{"text":"favorite restaurant in town. This is what a bagel should be - hand rolled, boiled, and baked for a hard crust with chewy interior. Try the chimichurri cream cheese! Try the G! Try it all!  A little pricy but it's high quality food right on the square so complaining about that seems misguided. You want a cheap breakfast sammy, go to McDonald's or Bagels Forever (no shade on either of those establishments). Lines can be long on the weekend. Staff is all about their business, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Okay this place is chill I get it BUT why do they make using the bathroom so confusing. Why is there a key in the door with a large kitchen spoon attached to it, and no lock on the inside. If you come here and plan to use the he bathroom, expect anxiety."}
{"text":"Best bagel place in Madison. Great sandwiches, fresh meat and made fresh. Usually busy on the weekends but worth the wait. I personally love the breakfast sandwiches but you really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"If you give this place less than four stars then you don't actually live in Madison full time. Yes better bagels exist in the world,  but the dearth of quality bagels in Wisconsin makes this place an automatic 5 star for me. Coming from Chicago (in my case) or New York to Madison, after pizza and hot dogs, bagels are the next thing you'll miss. Einstein bros and Duncan donuts are trash. Every morning was a little extra depressing as I choked down my subpar bagel UNTIL I found Gotham.   Good quality nyc/real Jewish style bagels. Excellent spreads (green onion all the way baby!) and house cured lox. For the less traditional, they offer very good egg sandwiches too, but I personally see no reason to every stray from lox n cream cheese. Oh and if you've never tried one before, get a bialy. It's like the bagels super chill cousin that everyone loves. No need for cream cheese or toasting, I like to order one on addition to my bagel, to enjoy as a snack later.  Located just off the square. Good space inside. The only negative is the hours. For uw students, they close just after the hangover ends. I love breakfast for dinner, so i really wish they stayed open to at least 430. However, this is standard for bagel shops."}
{"text":"Best bagels in Madison by a long shot.  While their price per bagel is reasonable, having one with cream cheese can ratchet up the price somewhat.  You gotta try their oven roasted turkey...you can buy it by the pound (as well as their cream cheese flavors) and assemble at home."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town, hands down.  Yes, i will always hold a special nostalgic place in my heart for Bagels Forever but honestly, they are even in the same league.  Toasted everything bagel with lox and cream cheese.  It doesn't get better that this. Why not 5 stars?  They need to up their cleaning game.  Whenever I stop in, there always seem to be a film on the tables and floor.  Also, have to take a squeegee to those windows."}
{"text":"Love Gotham Bagels. When I have extra cash, I was stop their before work. I haven't had a New York style bagel, but that's how they market themselves and it's 20 million times better than Einstein's at the same price.  If I want a bagel sandwich, I always get the G on pumpernickel. The G is egg, cheddar cheese and bacon and it's not like the egg on a McDonald's sandwich, but they actually fry the egg. So delicious.   If I'm going to get a bagel, it's usually an everything bagel with plain cream cheese. They have a variety of famous cream cheese, but I'm lame and like to stick with plain stuff.   I've never tried any of their other sandwiches, but they look really good (and a little pricey). All the different sides and various delicious looking things behind glass make my mouth water, but I've been too cheap to try them.  All in all, Gotham is great for breakfast (hungover or not) and lunch. I wish I could eat there everyday."}
{"text":"First time here and not disappointed!  Came in for a breakfast sandwich and had the spicy Italian sausage, cage free egg, sharp cheddar cheese on a egg bagel and was fantastic.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.   Little bit of a wait for food but well worth it because they cook everything fresh to order."}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying I love Gotham's food and have always recommended it to people, however I can't keep supporting a place with such god awful service. I've always given them a pass, but I'm done.   My dad went in to pick up some bagels yesterday and after waiting for 10 minutes just to get a dozen bagels, they non-apologetically told him they were out of poppy seed and sesame seed AT OPEN on a Sunday, my dad seemed shocked. Instead of saying \"I'm sorry\", they guy behind the counter yelled at my dad and said \"DO YOU WANT YOUR BAGELS OR NOT?!\". He then proceeded to yell at my dad (with other customers around) and slammed the bagels on the counter. I've heard from other people that the abuse at Gotham is REAL and I've encountered it myself (one time I went in and ordered 3 dozen bagels and got a ton of attitude about how I really should have called that order in. Umm what? You're a bagel shop and it's just 3 dozen bagels...). I also one time witnessed a horrific incident between the owner and what I could gather was maybe an ex-employee. The owner was yelling at the guy saying \"I gave you your fucking money!!\" while the ex-employee was holding a toddler on his hip. Oh and this was inside of the packed store.   Their food is good but that gives them absolutely no right to treat paying customers like crap. I refused to support these guys any longer."}
{"text":"This Upper Midwest bagel shop is a tempered version of what you'd get on Manhattan's Upper West side. Since NYC bagel shops are the gold standard and obvious benchmark for comparison, I figured I'd contrast the Gotham experience with what you'd get at one of the well-known shops in Manhattan (I live in Madison and travel to NY regularly for family and work).  Menu: Caper cream cheese, lox, capicola, matzo ball soup... this place is authentic. A true NY bagel shop is going to be a little more like a deli with whitefish and other kosher items. That said, Gotham's menu is more complex and if you are just talking bagels it actually has a wider variety. There are several predefined egg sandwiches and lunch options. An espresso machine and fresh juices are available to wash things down.  Food: Gotham's bagels are a little less chewy than most traditional NY bagels. They are also slightly smaller. That said, the bagels taste great and have a perfect consistency when toasted.  The egg sandwiches are probably the default choice for someone looking to cure a hangover. They aren't bad, but they look more appealing on the menu than they actually taste. Cappicola, egg, and cheese sounds amazing, but the bagel is always a little too hard and the egg is cooked more than I'd like. This is on par with what I've had East of the Hudson river.  The real staple here is a bagel with cream cheese. I have a couple regular choices: everything bagel with veggie cream cheese; onion bagel with caper cream cheese, lox, and tomato. The only difference and potential gripe is that a bagel shop in NY is going to give you a lot more cream cheese and lox. This isn't a bad thing since I usually end up scraping off a lot of extra cream cheese in that case, but I wouldn't mind getting a slightly heartier server than Gotham currently provides.  Price: the bagels are pricey compared to what you might pay at a chain or grocery store, particularly in Madison. That said, a bagel with cream cheese and lox is $8 at Gotham, and roughly $13 at Tal Bagels in Manhattan.  Service: most people working there seem like stereotypical New Yorkers, particularly the owner and the guys working the grill and bagel oven. This oddly feels MORE authentic than what you usually get in NYC, where Hispanics dominate the labor force in the food industry.  The people working the counter are sort of rude without doing anything that is specifically rude. Perhaps it's just the lack of the smile or any attempt at smalltalk. I think they are playing into Midwestern perceptions of what service in NY is supposed to be like, even though it's not really in line with reality (at least for a bagel shop).  There is a decent wait to get your food if it is even remotely busy. If Gotham bagels was located in Manhattan, this would be it's Achilles heel. As another reviewer noted, the orders are served sequentially, so even if you get something simple, they aren't going to touch it until they finish that order of 6 custom bagels for the coasties that were in line in front of you. This isn't Brueggers or Eintein's and you have to have that expectation going in or you are going to get very frustrated.   Atmosphere: the dark wood tables and stools have a nice urban feel to them, and overall it's cleaner and nicer than most authentic delis or bagel shops that I've seen in NY. That said, the only real \"character\" here is from the images of subway stations and other NY landmarks on the wall. Some people might say that it's gimmicky to have pictures of another city up in a restaurant, but they could have gone a lot further with the whole NY theme and thankfully have kept it pretty low key.  Conclusion: great location, best bagels I've had outside of New York, and a great breakfast/brunch for under $10. This is definitely worth a visit if you are looking for a solid way to start the day or recover from the day before."}
{"text":"So many people have posted pictures and raved about this place and I finally had a chance to try it out. I had no idea about it until I saw people tag is on Instagram.   I have driven by on the weekends and it is PACKED. I went on a Tuesday morning and it was so quiet. Perfect for me. There are a good amount of tables (high tops, window seating, tables).   I got an everything bagel with pastrami & egg. The egg was made exactly how I like: medium with the egg yolk oozing out at every bite.  The pastrami was perfect. Yum. I wanted more and didn't want the bagel bites to end.   I also had coffee -- self serve. I love places that carry the raw sugar. It's what I typically want with my coffee.   Goal is to come here often so I can try the whole menu. That's how excited I am about this place!"}
{"text":"Gotham Bagels is the real deal. Best bagels you can find in the Madison area and they take it to the next level with their sandwiches. Although I'm a Madison resident, I travel to New York regularly and know genuine New York bagels - Gotham Bagels can easily contend with the well known NYC establishments like Kossar's and Murray's.   Their sandwiches are amazing and I feel like it's a disservice to use only \"amazing\" to describe them. I've tried a few but am always impressed with the Mexico and Toscano. The specials on the board shouldn't be missed and usually have at least one or two \"can't miss\" options. The ingredients are fresh. The attention to creating a \"perfect\" sandwich is 100%. The menu is impressive. They do it right - all the time!  If you're looking for a \"bagel place\" then Gotham Bagels isn't for you. If you're looking for crazy-good bagels and home-made (and delicious) food then you've found your \"go to\" spot at Gotham Bagels!"}
{"text":"Gotham Bagels, one of the few establishments that the undergrads will walk past State St. for food, maybe because they are young and not worried about excess carbs yet.  This place is definitely popular, maybe because they are one of the few dedicated bagel places in Madison? If I want a bagel I would come here. My 3 star rating does not mean they are bad. They are A-ok in my book and that is what a 3 star is. They claim they are New York style bagel but I'm not sure what that exactly tastes like so I can't make a proper comparison.   It takes awhile for food to come out. Especially if it's Saturday morning and the farmers market is going on. If there is a long line prepare to wait 10 mins to line and about another 15 for food. I don't mind spending some time resting my feet here while shopping at the farmer's market.   If you order a sandwich the bagel isn't toasted. I can't imagine eating a bagel untoasted. I'm not sure if the same goes for a regular bagel with cream cheese if you have to specify you want toasted. I thought toasting a bagel was a given but apparently not. But if you do get a toasted bagel here it is quite heavenly. I do enjoy their super egg everything bagel, one that I have not seen elsewhere. A standard bagel and butter or cream cheese will run you about 3 dollars. Anything more than that lox or veggies will easily start getting you in the $6+ dollar range.   I spent a few Saturdays here this summer, for some reason I kept craving bagels. There's plenty of seating so you can munch on your bagel and listen to undergrads talk about where the best frat party is that night. Or how they don't have money and haven't gone grocery shopping in a month. But then why are you buying bagels!? Oh well...maybe I'm just getting old."}
{"text":"I cannot. BELIEVE. that Gotham only has 3 stars.  As I preuse the reviews, it's pretty apparent that their low rating is mostly due to peoples' opinion of their lack of friendly service.  While I understand that service is incredibly important, I could never bring myself to give a low rating to a restaurant with such perfect bagels.  They're perfect!    I am a bagel fanatic;  I consider New York style bagels to be one of my favorite foods.  I've been to New York multiple times and sought out the best bagels I could find in New York City, and I honestly think that Gotham is right up there with them.  I've lived in Madison for about 7 years now, and I've been a consistent Gotham-goer throughout all of the 7 years.  I've searched for similar New York style bagel restaurants in Milwaukee and Waukesha (where my parents live) and there is absolutely nothing that can compare.    Gotham's bagels are huge, chewy on the outside, soft and doughy on the inside, and just covered in whatever bagel topping you prefer.  My go-to order has always been an everything with scallion cream cheese.  It is so fresh and satisfying that it's hard for me to stray to different menu items.  Being that I've been going there for years, I have tried sandwiches and multiple varieties of their deli salads, and I've never been disappointed (in the least).    Usually, bad service would deter me from writing a positive review, but Gotham always has produced and always will produce the most delicious bagels that I could ever hope to find in Southeastern Wisconsin, therefore I'll continue to love them like I would love an asshole family member.  No one in particular, that I am referring to... and honestly, this isn't the kind of restaurant that you go to to relax and enjoy the service, it's the kind of restaurant that you stop in to grab the best New York bagel in a 100 mile radius and get out.  Take it for what it is, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is about a block away from my apartment and is so incredible. First of all most of the employees are incredibly friendly, the place itself is super quaint and cute, but most importantly they have hands down the best bagels. I would, however, think it would be good for them to add a few other bagel choices. Specifically some sweet bagels as I am a big fan of ones like blueberry, cinnamon sugar, etc. otherwise it's a great place to stop by for a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"After some not so great experiences at Gotham five-plus years ago, I avoided them. Last summer I stopped in with some friends who were in town and had planned to brunch at the Old Fashioned but hadn't anticipated the hours-long wait so decided to just grab something quick instead.   In the past, I'd always ordered a plain bagel, untoasted, and plain cream cheese. When they very first opened, my selection was unbearably salty; later it was just dry and cakey. On my return to the land of Gotham I went with a bagel sandwich - the Yellow C.A.B - cheddar, avocado, and bacon. So good. The bagel was chewy and didn't have me reaching for a glass of water to rehydrate. I've returned to Gotham and this sandwich many times since. The bacon is thick and crispy and full of flavor. The avocado is fresh and creamy. The melted cheese pulls it all together. It's a great choice for when you need something hearty but don't have the time and/or desire to do a whole sit-down meal.   I've also tried the spicy pineapple & mint and cranberry lavender juices. Definitely a tasty addition. The spicy pineapple took me a couple sips to acclimate, but once I got over the unique flavor and pulpiness I was into it. The cranberry is extremely tart (no grape juice blend here) and has a pleasant floral aftertaste.   The only thing keeping me from five stars is that the untoasted plain bagel with cream cheese route is still dry. I have to say I was surprised - I've had the plain bagel in sandwich form many times now and it's had the chew I've craved. Unheated, though, it's just not there. The honeyed cherry cream cheese was good (and was in a portion big enough for two bagels) but it just couldn't make up for the texture of the bagel itself. I think my next attempt will be ordering the cream cheese on the side and taking it home to warm it."}
{"text":"It was a tad expensive for the Madison food scene, and my bagel wasn't super tasty (Tuscan farmer) but all of my friends got sandwiches that smelled amazing and they raved about them!"}
{"text":"friendly service, relaxed atmosphere, reasonable prices, wide variety of menu options, delicious food! will definitely be returning frequently."}
{"text":"I've always had great service and excellent, yummy bagels.  I love the super everything with salmon cream cheese...which they also make fresh.  Be hungry though as they serve monster portions."}
{"text":"I've been coming here just about every Saturday or Sunday for the last 7 months and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed. Whether I chose one of the many specials, a bacon egg and cheese or just went with a shmear of cream cheese, everything has been phenomenal. Every bagel is as excellent as the last and each time I come here I love this place a little more. Everyone says New York bagels are the best but I think this place comes pretty close in comparison.   On top of the delicious bagel sandwiches, I love the atmosphere that constantly has people coming through and a really entertaining staff behind the counter. I always end up sitting there and reading for an hour or so and consistently enjoy the ambiance that makes up Gotham bagels. I plan to continue coming just as frequently for the rest of my time in Madison."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town. They recently have taken the way of the economy and shrunk a bit but still the best! Awesome cream cheese too. This was the first place to bring authentic pastrami to town as well. Oh so good."}
{"text":"When it comes to crispy-outside doughy-inside hand-rolled bagely goodness this place is the real deal. They offer a variety of specials (this weekend they had soft shell crab and sword fish options for their bagel sandwiches, wiggity whaaaat?) and pile the cream cheese to the sky. Oh, and the cream cheese! They offer exotic (well, as exotic as cream cheese gets) flavors like walnut raisin, chimichurri, and olive, plus three tofu flavors. The bagels and sandwiches are super affordable- definitely worth stopping in on your way to work or while perusing the farmer's market on Saturday."}
{"text":"Visited Gotham Bagels for the first time this weekend. I immediately liked the New York-deli vibe and the variety of menu choices, which offered everything from bagel sandwiches to vegan cream cheese and prepared deli foods. I ordered the everything bagel with scallion cream cheese, topped with avocado and a fried egg. The flavors went really well together, and the cream cheese was delicious.  In terms of the actual bagel itself, I wasn't too impressed with the quality/texture-as someone who has had real New York bagels a lot, I went in knowing that these weren't going to be as good-still, bagel was a little hard, and the texture was mildly chewy which I wasn't a fan of. The sandwich was good, and for a local bagel place in Madison that has a cute vibe, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Flies everywhere....Gross... The bagels themselves aren't bad, but not fantastic either and you get enough cream cheese for 2 bagels on the one you order too. While I haven't gotten sick or had terrible service like some of the other people, the whole experience of eating while flies circled my head was enough to make me never return."}
{"text":"It was a random accident.  I wasn't quite up for the commitment of a full brunch and the obligatory bill, but I needed to find a place that would have something small enough to take the edge off.  High gluten has been off my radar for a while, due to blood sugar issues that I try hard to keep in control.  They have soup here, and how much risk is there with that selection?  As it turns out, more than I thought.  No cup available (or even offered when inquired) forced me to pony up $5 for a bowl of one of the more tepid and oversalted soups I've encountered in recent memory.  The FOH register guy who may have had some kind of mood disorder took my soup to the prep area, where I waited about 10 minutes for what should have been a 1 minute nuke job in the microwave.  The cast of characters working there would have been at home as extras in a revamped Mad Max movie, but I digress.  Let's just say when I am walking on that block, I won't be stopping back for a while."}
{"text":"Food is good, but it's always shocking how, with less than 5 people in the shop, it can take 20 minutes or more to get your toasted bagel. Come with a book and not an appetite."}
{"text":"My life partner thoroughly enjoys the lox and I loved their strawberry cream cheese, unfortunately they discontinued it and we haven't gone back since. Their cranberry juice is off the chain, the price eh not so much.   Please bring back the delicious pink delight!"}
{"text":"Was slightly disappointed that they were out of everything bagels, but there were plenty of others to choose from. It might have been the best pumpernickel bagel I've had. NY style, not too dense, and a perfect light toast. I had mine with lox and they did not spare on the cream cheese or fish. Awesome sandwich. Next time I'll try the Brighton which is what my friend ordered and looked amazing.   I splurged on a fresh squeezed oj that had just the right amount of pulp and was def worth the $3. My friend was jealous and wished she ordered one too.   In typical Sunday fashion, I also had a tall coffee. I really appreciated the choice between dark and light roast. I only wished they had sleeves for the cups since it was a bit warm on my hand without but great coffee all the same.   Most importantly, the service was excellent. We were greeted right away and the staff were friendly, conversational, and quick service.   Great experience with delicious food. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Spent some of my best years in Manhattan, so you bet your sweet ass I was excited to finally try the bagels here. Looking for that sweet cultural sanctuary in this vanilla little town.  Welp, I ordered an untoasted plain bagel with vegetable cream cheese.   I'm not a fan of warm cream cheese nor am I fan of toasted bagels. Frankly, I shouldn't have to explain why I would like to have my almost $4 bagel this way, as I am the paying guest.  My bagel came toasted. My cream cheese was warm.   Granted, I did not complain for 2 reasons, 1 I was starving, 2 the staff didn't seem like they would be receptive to me asking for another bagel.   Perhaps, unlike many of the people who live in Madison, the owners assume none of \"us\" have been to New York. New York isn't like in Seinfeld - no soup nazi. Local business owners in NY know how to keep their customers because they are aware there are 15 other locations people can choose from. By the way, you are in the Midwest now; so showing a little bit of niceness won't kill your business or NY schtick. Because I guarantee, the very pale and corn fed cashier isn't a transplant from the Bronx. She knows how to say thank you, but for some reason she doesn't feel it necessary to say so in this establishment.   Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I went back to Gotham craving a bagel, forgetting my past disappointments. I was more disappointed than ever.  The food is just not good. The ham, trying to be fancy, is so disgustingly salty and does not belong on an egg and cheese sandwich. The sausage is also some weird patty and not a normal sausage patty you'd have on a breakfast sandwich.  Gotham says it's a NY style bagel shop but misses the mark when it tries too hard. The bagels are great but your egg sandwiches are almost inedible (my friend and I both picked at ours and didn't finish).   The wait for the food is far too long, it's overpriced and nobody smiles."}
{"text":"Good solid food. Large portions. Nice atmosphere and good price point. This is my go-to place on the square."}
{"text":"Gotham Bagels offers a good, quick, cheap lunch or snack in downtown Madison. The bagels here are fairly high quality and you can mix and match and make interesting bagel sandwiches with a variety of vegetable spreads and also tofutti-based spreads.  I had a \"V\" sandwich on a toasted garlic bagel ($4.28 with tax) which consisted of arugula, tofutti-scallion spread, tomatoes, avocado, and roasted poblano peppers. It was pretty tasty and quite filling and cheap; however, the sandwich is totally overloaded and quite messy to handle, which forced me to use at least a few napkins (better to eat these sandwiches sitting down at a table, not on-the-go or in the car).  The location in downtown Madison is good, though the place closes too early (3 p.m.). One other suggestion for improvement: add some mockmeat options, such as fakin' bacon and Tofurkey; Gotham's vegan options are good, but don't go far enough."}
{"text":"Visited Madison for just 5 days and came here for bagels in three different occasions. BEST BAGELS EVER! Handrolled, freshly made, DELICIOUS. So many options to choose from. And that pastrami... Oh that pastrami!"}
{"text":"Had to get a quick bite and stopped through for breakfast this morning. Had an \"Everything\" bagel with their special jalapeno garlic cream cheese, not toasted.  It was \"everything\" I could hope for in a bagel. Not too soft, not too hard - just right, flavorful, easy to eat. The cream cheese was so fluffy and tasty.   I couldn't find caloric information anywhere, but I can't imagine it's any good. This was my \"cheat\" breakfast of the week."}
{"text":"Here's the rub. I go here often and love the bagels! They are the best in town by far. However, the service is excruciatingly slow and inconsistent . I still go there despite this , just not as often as i would normally. I would move this score to a five if they ever remedied this."}
{"text":"Thanks Gotham, for single-handedly destroying the beautiful Sunday morning.  In a past, I did have complained about the slow service, but never mind about that. Because this morning's unexpected rude awakening by the cashier just ranked #1 on my list of bad food service experience.  I don't know what went wrong, but if I'm paying $25/pound for lox and putting few changes in the tip jar, is it really unreasonable to expect a courtesy service, or at least an average one?  To be fair, during the week day mornings, I do receive nice \"good morning\" and equally pleasant service. Maybe Sunday is a bad day. Maybe the cashier girl wasn't fully awake, or maybe, I shouldn't bother picking up bagels from them altogether."}
{"text":"I've mentioned before that I'm not in love with New York City like some people are, but I am a fan of certain aspects of the city. And after visiting Gotham bagels, this is one little slice of New York that I am glad has landed in Madison.  The specials announced on the board were all named after the current presidential contenders, but unlike those folks, every single one of the specials sounded amazing. I settled on the Sanders, basically a New York bagel plus whitefish and arugula. It was heavenly. Prepared with precision, plentiful and super fresh ingredients, neatly wrapped and easy to handle presentation, and absolutely delicious flavors. The pickle was the biggest surprise as it was sweet and sour and extremely spicy, enough to make me break a little sweat on this cold winter day. Pow!   The menu is extensive and there were so many that I'll need to come back and try. Colectivo coffee and many other beverages, and a deli case with salads and other premade foods sold by the pound.  The cashier was friendly, but there was a dark, brooding, semi surly guy preparing food which only added to the NYC style authenticity. Four stars because the interior was a little messy around the trash bins, and what is up with the grungy, yellow stained drop ceiling tiles? Was the place a cigar bar in its last life?  PS: 15% off your first Yelp! check-in purchase, not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Delicious NYC-style bagel."}
{"text":"Disappointing. It's such a simple concept. Bagels with different spreads, breakfast sandwiches and more gourmet sandwiches.   The bagels themselves are delicious - some of the best I've ever had. But I'm referring to the bagels untoasted with my own cream cheese.   The times I've ordered a bagel with cream cheese or in a breakfast sandwich were surprisingly mediocre. I ordered the bacon egg and cheese sandwich once, and another time a garlic bagel with jalapeño garlic cream cheese.   The sandwich was just alright. The bacon was the star, otherwise the sandwich was overpriced and bland (~$6?)  The bagel toasted with cream cheese was worse. The outside of the bagel was toasted until an almost black brown, but the bagel was cold. The cream cheese could've filled up a tub you'd buy from a grocery store. Cold, hard, and overwhelmed by cold cream cheese - not the most pleasant  So I'd recommend grabbing a bagel with nothing on it, toasting if you'd like, and using your own cream cheese. This way, their bagels are some of the best."}
{"text":"Rachel B identified the bagel, she just didn't know it. These are not NY bagels. Sorry to disappoint you Gotham Bagels, but you are not dense enough to classify yourself as New York. You are more of a Montreal or even a Toronto style bagel, although you are slightly larger than a classic Toronto bagel, like Gryfe's. Yes the name says Gotham, and they have the cute menu that mentions all the clever NYC names, but your bagel is not NY. The bagel is not quite chewy enough, it is not dense enough, the flavor is a little bland. New York bagels are boiled. Montreal bagels contain honey and are baked in a wood fired oven. That is a Montreal Bagel, or a Toronto bagel. You might consider changing your name to Fairmount Bagels, or  St. Viateur bagels. The true New York bagel is dense, chewy and can be eaten completely as it stands, nothing on it, their is a flavor that pops out from the bagel that is undeniably New York. It can not be duplicated, not in Madison, not in Boston, not anywhere. However, it can be made close. Your bagels are too fluffy, too white bread to be a New York bagel. Bagels Forever is a closer NY bagel. Your bagels are good, but your classification is incorrect. Sorry to disappoint Gotham."}
{"text":"Oh Gotham,  The dreadful disposition of every person that works there is enough for me to rate you so poorly, but you know what, cranky staff aside, (I guess this is part of your NY shtick?) it's STILL hard for me to give you anything greater than two stars, as all 3 times I've been there, I've left with a botched up order.  Now shame on me for not checking orders the second and third time, right... but shame on you for hearing whole wheat bagel with egg and sausage and giving me a whole wheat bagel with bacon and cheese. Short of getting back there and making the thing myself... I'm not certain how to have a stellar experience at your place of business.   I could understand if the place was packed. I could understand if you were short staffed and moving quick. I could understand if I was making substitutions to an existing sandwich and the person making my sandwich got confused. I can't understand how when there's no line, 5 visible employees and I choose \"Design Your Own\" it's so blatantly wrong. And the parking situation isn't conducive to someone driving back there to remedy it, and so for the third time I threw $6 in the trash.  But no more. Perhaps if I hear the operation gets tighter, if someone tells me it's worth another shot, I'll go back? But when I do I'll order a plain bagel that I adorn with fixins I have in my fridge. You've programmed me to believe there's no other way."}
{"text":"Bagels Forever and Gotham are tied for best bagels in Madison IMHO. I've only ever had bagels, cream cheese, and coffee here, so I can't comment on much else. The bagels are pretty close to a real east coast bagel, but they seem too big to me. The cream cheese is good, they make their own and have a lot of flavors. They really layer it on the bagels, so much so that I usually end up taking off ~90% of it before eating.  The service here sucks...the guys who work here are slow, rude, and have trouble remembering your order (which they write down!). The prices are also pretty steep for bagels.  Definitely worth trying especially if you're downtown, but you can get bagels that are just as good (ok yes they're smaller) for cheaper at Bagels Forever!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, despite having a pretty stellar breakfast sandwich and downtown's only edible (and very delicious) bagel, I will no longer be patronizing Gotham Bagels.  Their food is delicious; I've been lucky to have had former employees share some of their delightful deli options with me in the past. The egg and cheddar on pumpernickel with arugula and tomato has been my favorite hangover remedy for a couple of years now. The prices are very fair for their quality and the fact that it is a deli. Those who disagree are encouraged to consider their location and their overhead.  However, their service has gone significantly downhill, and they are severely lacking in good management. This morning I swung by before work with my partner. We each ordered an egg and whatever sandwich, grabbed beverages and sat down to wait. I was so excited when the customer prior to us finally got her sandwich, as it was very busy and I was very hungry. Thirty minutes into our visit we realized employees were doing prep work and we still hadn't received our orders. As I was already going to be late to work, we decided to ask for refunds, at which point the manager (maybe the owner) went to the kitchen and realized the printer was unplugged, and the kitchen hadn't received our orders. I thought for sure the young lady who took our orders had seen us sitting sandwichless for much too long after the cook had finished prior orders. The man gave us our requested refund, but I'm upset that my tip money sat in that jar after I had left.  One experience is something, but this was the THIRD time in half a year this happened to me. Three strikes, I'm done. I make the best breakfast sandwich in town anyway.  As the manager of a retail brick-and-mortar , I am quite disappointed to see a lack of the same care and diligence I put into my store. They really need to put more effort into organization and accountability.  But damn, I'm gonna miss those bagels."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bagels in Madison. Their bagel breakfast sandwiches are made with real, fresh ingredients, putting Einsteins to shame. You'll really taste the difference.  We liked the food, service, atmosphere, value, bagels, super tasty food, real italian sausage patties, fresh eggs, food served in charming wicker baskets, smooth espresso, quality wood furnishing, seeing bagels being made, the nice clean space and filling food.  We disliked that there were no chairs - only stools, no posted menu, no specific food pickup location, and that the staff was not prepared for unusual requests and obviously were not native English speakers."}
{"text":"The bagel with the salmon! Very good, very filling and doesn't make you feel bad about eating out since they do have have tasty, healthy options! Went in here for a quick lunch, and I do advise against that! Usually there is a line and decent wait. But trust me, if you have the time, it's worth the wait! Every time I've been here I've had a great meal. Thanks"}
{"text":"Great place near the square to stop in for a quick bagel. Haven't tried any other local bagel places in Madison yet, but this one is pretty good. My roommate assured me that it's as authentic NYC as you can get (outside of NYC, that is).  I've had the sesame bagel with salmon and lox, which was outstanding! I've also ordered the everything bagel, which to me is very, very salty. I like that they use sea salt, but come on! I had to pick some of it off, which in turn removed the \"everything\" from the bagel. I've had this with the salmon cream cheese, which is a nice alternative to the salmon and lox (and less expensive).   They seem to have a lot of ingredients for sandwiches and such. Will definitely return to try some of their other options."}
{"text":"Gotham Bagels is the spot to be on a Sunday morning. My girlfriend lives a few blocks from here and we do not miss a Gotham run on the weekend.  The bagels are dope. Excellent consistency, great size and all your classic varieties. My personal favorite is their Super Egg Everything, which is an egg bagel topped with, you guessed it, everything. If you're really about that life, check out the bialy.  The cream cheese selection is also on point, although I rarely venture away from chive because I just really like chive.  They have new special sandwiches every week that are typically adventurous and fantastic. This past weekend I had the \"Los Angeles,\" which had spicy chorizo, cheese and salsa verde. 'Twas delish."}
{"text":"I might have given this place a better review if the owner hadn't yelled \"Hey! I'm trying to run a business here!\" at me for having the audacity to not hear him call my name the first time in a loud and crowded restaurant. I also might have given this place a better review if 10 minuets later the owner hadn't accused my girlfriend of stealing a bottle of water, which she didn't of course. However, I might not have, because the food wasn't that special anyway. Maybe keep the NYC-style bagels, and lose the NYC-style attitude?"}
{"text":"I has another enjoyable experience at Gotham today, this time for lunch instead of breakfast. I really enjoy their bagels and cream cheese schmears, but today I was really feeling like a sandwich. I decided to try one of their specials: kofte with cucumber, tomato, and yogurt sauce. They also had a really good looking soup of the day so I gave that a shot as well.   The soup was Italian sausage with potato and kale, and it was awesome! There were a lot of different flavors working here; fattiness and spice from the sausage, bitterness from the kale, richness from the potato. Really, really good stuff! The soup was filling without being heavy and ended up being a great compliment for the sandwich i ordered.   I asked for the kofte special on a garlic bagel and it was a really solid choice! The kofte was grilled up hot and fresh and was very juicy and flavorful. While it was being made I was asked if I wanted onions (which were not on the menu description), to which I replied 'of course'. The onions were a great addition, but unfortunately I didn't get any tomato on the sandwich. The yogurt sauce was a really nice counterpoint to the kofte and the cucumbers were crisp and added a nice brightness.   Best of all, on a Tuesday afternoon I had the chance to sit and enjoy Gotham Bagels without a crazy line and huge crowd. There were a few other lucky folks around so it wasn't dead, but not jammed like a weekend morning during farmer's market season.   For my money Gotham's bagels are among the best in the area and I look forward to enjoying them again soon and often."}
{"text":"Yummy! After a big weekend of drinking in Madison, we came to Gotham to grab some breakfast before heading on the road.  The place reminds me of a bagel shop ones might find in New York.  The line was okay, but it was still pretty early, about 9am.  We got the everything bagels with bacon, egg, and cheese as well as a tuna salad and egg salad to go for lunch.  It did take a while for them to make but it did not disappoint.  After being there for about 30 minutes, the line managed to get very long, pretty much out the door, so I guess we got there at the perfect time before the huge rush!"}
{"text":"This spot is the quintessential bagel experience in Madison.  The bagels are fresh, hand rolled delights.  There are bagel sandwich options, as well as, toasted bagel and cream cheese.  If you like bagels, there is something here for you.    My go to bagel is the plain because it doesnt need anything else.  I usually pair it with the plain cream cheese.  But lately, I have been really into the smoked salmon cream cheese.  Bagel, cream cheese, and a large coffee cost six dollars.  Sat mornings are busy but the line moves well.  If you want to sit in, just watch for an opening or share a communal table.  But if it's warm enough outside just take it to go.  The Capitol Lawn is just a block away."}
{"text":"I am happy to have finally tried Gotham! as a new yorker, bagels and deli's are soemthing i STILL miss. I will say this first- bagels are good.. they are NOT as good as NY bagels but closer than anything else in the Madison area. There sammiches are GREAT tho- and I swear I never, ever thought I would get a yummy chicken cutlet sammich unless I was in the Northeast,(mst people don't even know what a chicken cutlet is here!!) and Gotham proved me wrong! Great sammiches, so worth it... I wish we could do half stars.. this is a 3.5 for sure!!"}
{"text":"Coming from the New York area, I'm very snobby about my bagels. This place is by far the best bagel joint in Madison. I would even say it's the only place I have found outside of the NY area that serves real bagels.  When comparing these to other bagels in the Midwest, it's a blowout. Other places don't even compare.  When comparing these to the best bagels I've had back home, these hold their own, which is saying a lot. I wouldn't say these are among the greatest bagels I've ever had, but if I had them in NYC, I would classify them as good, which is quite a feat.  Bagel selection and spread selection is great. Breakfast sandwiches are great. Lox is great. It's nice to have a little bit of New York available in Madison (considering the lack of pizza in the area)."}
{"text":"I went to the Farmers Market to walk around in the glorious warm sun and left with pretty much just carbs...I bought bread, pasta and unfortunately, bagels from Gotham.  The bagels themselves weren't bad...nothing to write home about in my opinion..but not awful.  It was the service that is really why I would never go back.  I waited in line with a friend-she ordered her bagels and then I went to order next and was VERY loudly accused of cutting in line by a rude man who seemed to think he was in charge.  I calmly explained that I was waiting here the entire time and then started to order the bagels but he was extremely short and rude with me the entire time.  No time for that-I'll get my bagels from Bagels Forever instead!"}
{"text":"Okay, their bagels are good. The stuff they put on the bagels is good. HOWEVER - they are overpriced. There is almost always a huge line, which moves slowly. Even when it is crazy busy on the weekend, there is usually only one person on the grill and so the food takes forever. Expect to be treated rudely by someone, at some point.   My fiance refuses to go here anymore #solidarity"}
{"text":"My first visit to Gotham didn't quite blow me away like I thought it was going to, sadly. However, I may not have ordered one of the most popular items, so I think I'll give it another shot sometime to change my opinion!  My roommates and I all went for the spicy Italian sausage, cheddar and egg sandwich on Gotham's everything bagel. They came out pretty quickly (we were there around 9 on a Sunday morning -- it wasn't too busy) and were neatly made. I noticed right away that the size of the bagel maybe seemed a bit small? But that could have been the normal for all of Gotham's bagels -- I'm not sure. Anyways, like I said, I wasn't blown away by my breakfast, but I will say that the italian sausage was super yummy -- the cashier informed me that it's all made in house. And I'm a sucker for some egg yolkiness in my food. Next time, I might try some of their lox!  I think I would have changed out the type of bagel, in hindsight. The bagel was so thick, I wished that I had the sandwich on something thinner. Also, due to the bagel being toasted and thick, I ended up scraping the roof of my mouth on the tougher part of the bagel, which was really annoying/painful for the rest of the day and the day after whenever I ate something. I know that Gotham makes bialys which are (I googled this) Polish in origin and are baked rolls, similar to bagels. They seem to be a bit thinner, so I think I'd go for that next time.  Overall, I think I would have been much happier with a different bagel choice -- so I'm excited to give Gotham another try!"}
{"text":"They have some good bagels in town. Good selection of cream cheeses and tofu spreads. I also liked their idea of serving bagel crisps along with each order ( i hope they make these bagel crisps out of unused bagels at the end of the day to avoid wastage). Sure they have a lot of people hanging around at this place in the mornings, but they can surely improve in providing much quicker and better service."}
{"text":"Long lines go by fast and well worth the wait. Bacon, egg, and cheese on sesame or super egg bagel is the go-to. Perfect compliment to a sunny day walk around the capital. Great detour to a Saturday farmer's market trip!"}
{"text":"It had been a couple of years since I visited Gotham, and decided to stop in and get a toasted pumpernickel with cream cheese and lox. Hadn't had one in ages. So here we go, let's take a look. They gave me a nice spicy pickle on top of the wrapped bagel. Nice touch, liked it. Plenty of cream cheese, and the bagel itself didn't disappoint. But hold up.... $6 for this bagel, cream cheese and lox?? And.... hello??? There's not even any red onion or tomato included. I'da thought that was a given when asking for bagel and lox???? Okay, stlightly miffed and disappointed, but still my favorite place here in town for bagels, although there are other options I have yet to try."}
{"text":"By far the best bagels this far from the Big Apple. Efficient counter service. Delicious!"}
{"text":"These are the best bagels in Madison and lucky to have east coast quality bagels in the Midwest.   Yes, there is a long line on the weekends, but it moves (I won't say quickly) and is the best grab-and-go brunch.   If you come here near closing you can buy a dozen bagels for practically nothing."}
{"text":"Great bagels and accouterments. I would definitely come here again if I'm ever in Madison. Service is no-frills but I wouldn't call it unfriendly. The menu of bagels and sandwiches is pretty extensive, with specials on the board. There's also a deli case with items like specialty cream cheese and tuna and egg salads on display.  I thought about getting a bagel with smoked whitefish salad since you don't see that everywhere. But in the end I couldn't resist getting a classic bagel with lox. I got mine on an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese and tomato. It was delicious. The bagel was fresh and chewy. The lox and cream cheese were perfectly balanced. It was a little messy to eat but I'm a messy eater to begin with. The coffee is from Colectivo.  I did have a little trouble finding the place. The Google Maps directions were atrocious. Though that's more of a complaint about Google Maps than the restaurant. I tried to come in through the wrong door and I felt a little stupid, but then I saw someone else do the same thing, so maybe it's not just me."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to write this review because I used to love Gotham, but that ship seems to have sailed. Just now, I pulled on their doors to get a bagel at about 140pm on a Wednesday and the door was locked. No sign, no nothing and the guy at the counter just stared at me.   Rewind to about 2 months ago. Again, I went in after the lunch rush (because that is when my scheduled lunch is) to get a bagel. There were 3-4 other customers and probably 4-5 people working. The owner was counting money out of the drawer. He ignored me for a few seconds, glanced up, and then said, She'll help you and gestured toward the girl behind him. She looked surprised but jumped to help me. As I waited for my sandwich, I noticed how dirty everything was. I'm sure they had been busy but it was dead by this point. Finally, I go to the women's bathroom and after using it, find out that the toilet is broken. No sign, no nothing.   Are their bagels/sandwiches/everything delicious? Hell yes. I'm just starting to wonder if it's worth it. The owner should stop counting money and tighten up his biz a little."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Sometimes the owner can be a bit crabby but usually only if they're busy."}
{"text":"My son and I come here before we head over to the Children's Museum in the morning.   I like that they have a lot of different choices of bagel sandwiches or you can get bagels with all sorts of different cream cheeses including a vegan tofu cream cheese which actually tastes really good. I like their lox and cream cheese on a toasted garlic bagel. My son likes the cinnamon raisin bagel.   It can get busy here and you can wait in a line for a while but its good if your willing to wait."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went down to the square on Saturday morning and were going to try the brunch at Marigold's Kitchen.  I'm glad that we stumbled across Gotham Bagels instead because it led to a fantastic breakfast and a good overall experience.  The main reason for stepping into the store was because I needed change for the parking meter, and because we couldn't find Marigold's.  The woman behind the counter at Gotham was incredibly pleasant, she had a real down to earth personality and not only did she give me change but she also drew a map on paper of how to get to Marigold's.  This was pretty shocking to me as I was essentially leaving their restaurant for the competition.  Well after that gesture, my girlfriend and I looked around and realized that Gotham actually looked fairly good themselves, so we decided to stay and eat.  They had a full deli section of potato salads and other items, and a menu of dozens of different bagel sandwiches.  The furniture was of a nice rustic wooden decor, and there was a TV with the basketball game on at a very appropriate volume.    While we waited for our food, the nice counter lady brought over a cinnamon roll for us (on the house).  It was delicious, and I'm not even a big fan of that type of pastry.  10 minutes later we got our food, two salivating bagel sandwiches with fresh on-the-spot ingredients and uniquely flavored cheeses, sausages, etc (in the sandwich).  Overall we had a great time and will for sure be coming back again.  It doesn't look like the place you'd get your daily breakfast from, but it's perfect for a nice Saturday or Sunday leisurely trip."}
{"text":"Best bagels in Madison. Bagels are delicious, all the cream cheeses are good and they're always rotating a few specialty ones. I love the Chimichurri cream cheese. Favorite sandwich and go to is the Brighton Beach on Super Egg Everything. They often have very good special sandwiches.   Today I had a cup of the clam and oyster chowder. Wow...tons of clam and oyster meat, so it made for a delicious, perfectly salted, meaty chowder. Also went with my go-to - Brighton Beach."}
{"text":"Here to add to and endorse the reviews of others before me.  I think Gotham has great bagels - real, authentic NY/Philly bagels in every way - always fresh and tasty. Very good sandwiches, chicken salad, and atmosphere as well.  But they lose two big stars for their below standard service. They inexplicably have one slow, indifferent person taking orders, with a handful of other people filling them. What would make more sense and is done at most other delis is that each attendant interact with the customer, take their order, and shepherd it to completion. The wait in line is almost always longer than it needs to be. If the person in front of me has a long, complicated order, it shouldn't matter.   Second, the attendants are often rude and/or indifferent, and it's not just a one-off observation.  The only reason I could see for the owners to tolerate the current situation is that they just do not care about making money."}
{"text":"The people running the register are so extremely rude.  Service is terribly slow, and you constantly see people behind you getting served before you.  My girlfriend got an egg bagel and I ordered a normal bagel and cream cheese.  Surprisingly, her's was done before mine was, and I realize after the fact that I saw it sitting there ready to serve for five or ten minutes before anyone put cream cheese on my bagel to complete our order.  They were also extremely rude to my friend and when he tried to use his debit card (on a $5 order) the guy asked him if he had cash instead.  Who does that?  He eventually accepted the card so obviously it wasn't against policy or anything.  Never again will I go there."}
{"text":"If your reading this review of a Midwest bagel shop and thinking to yourself \"Midwest?  Bagels?  Pshaw!\", stop right now and throw your monitor/MacBook out the nearest window.  With those naysayers gone, let me continue.  I've been to Manhattan and I've had the bagels, and yes, they're pretty good. Down on Mifflin street, I've had something that tasted just as good minus the NYC stink of man urine.  Good bagels.  Good meat.  Good coffee.   All for under $5.  Naysayers can suck it."}
{"text":"Waited 45min for just 1 1/2 dozen bagels and cream cheese. No sandwiches. Joe (the dude who struts around the place) walked by me (after I had patiently waited 25min) told me I \"don't look very patient\". I explained to him my order, but \"Mr. Customer Service\" just made a face and blew me off. Then after 35min I ask the poor guy frantically making sandwiches why I had to wait so long for just bagels, he found out THEY LOST MY ORDER\" OMG.  After 45minutes I finally get my $38 worth of bagels and cream cheese in 2 ripping bags. So frustrating. No bagel is good enough for that kind of treatment."}
{"text":"The wife and I happened upon Gotham Bagels our first day in Madison, and we've made it a tradition to go every Saturday. The bagels are amazing and I'm assuming \"authentic\", but who cares, they're really good.  Part of the assumed authenticity comes from the brusque and curt way the staff deals with customers; it's just like being in New York!!!  Generally they're nice enough and, if nothing else, you get a friggin' amazing bagel out of the interaction. How anyone rates this less than 4-stars is beyond me..."}
{"text":"We were walking to a different breakfast spot but, upon seeing the packed restaurant and the \"hot bagels\" sign, we really couldn't resist. I really wanted to like this place. Bagels are one of my biggest weaknesses, and this place looked legit, but it really did nothing in the end to earn my favor. For starters, there's the wait time. My husband ordered a bagel sandwich and I just ordered a toasted bagel with butter. It took a solid 20 minutes for us to get our food, and it was clear they made my bagel right away and left it to sit, as it was cold. Even worse, the combination of toasting it and letting it sit left me with what amounted to a solid jaw workout as I tried to chew through each bite. I seriously gave up halfway through. Maybe if I'd gotten, as promised, a \"hot bagel\" and I could have just added butter, that would have been one thing. But the suuuuper over-toasted, chewy option was lackluster at best. My husband's sandwich looked good, but not $10 good. Maybe $7 or $8 good, but $10?! Also, it seems that they pressed it in the process of preparing it, which left him with a similarly impossibly chewy bagel to chew through. I also tried what appeared to be their show stopper, the coffee cake, but it was so unimpressive I threw half of it away. The coffee was disappointing as well. Finally, each bagel dish is garnished with a bagel chip, which made me really excited, but it also tasted so bad I took two bites and gave up. So maybe this would be worth a future visit if I got a bagel to go and heated it up at home, sans toaster, but as it stands, I really don't understand the super high reviews or the crowds of people jostling for their Saturday morning bagel fix. The best thing I had was the bagel itself, and even that was disappointing, so that should say it all."}
{"text":"I want to be clear that I love the actual food here, but also had one of the worst dining experiences of my life here. The Madison chef's network week event was a complete disaster. I had been looking forward to it for a month. Start to finish we were there for 2 hours, 5 minutes of which we actually had our food.   We waited in line for 15 minutes which is fine. We ordered and were told it would be another 20 for our food. 1 hour and fifteen minutes later we received our sandwiches! But we were served two completely different sandwiches from what we ordered. We took them back because they clearly belonged to another customer that had also chosen their brunch spot poorly, and in the off chance that they hadn't died or left to complete a master's degree, we wanted to make sure they got their food.   We gave them back to the line cook who rolled his eyes, looked at us suspiciously, and double checked that we had the intelligence to know what sandwich we'd ordered, since obviously that's the most likely scenario. He then disappeared with the sandwiches and was never heard from again. We were left with no apology, no update as to if our sandwiches even existed in the physical plane, and most importantly, no sandwiches.   We waited an additional half hour to contemplate our bad life choices before our names were called. We got our sandwiches. They weren't on the right bagels, but they were apparently ours. We ate them. They tasted like food which is about all we could process at that point, and left hungry for lunch since breakfast had long passed us by."}
{"text":"I've lived on the West Coast for many dozen years and love it. There are a few things, though, that Easterners always complain about. The lack of decent bagels and the horrors that are passed off as pizza.  Having moved to Madison I was, therefore, optimistic about the chances of finding a decent bagel. And I have. More than decent. I tried Bagels Forever (OK) but these are real big, chewy NY bagels Yay!!!!  Now where can I find a decent Boston-style anchovy pizza??"}
